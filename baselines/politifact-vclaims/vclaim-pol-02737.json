Maxine Waters charged with 3 ethics violations \u2014 back in 2010", "text": "Internet posts claiming that U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., is facing corruption charges neglects to tell readers the incident is seven years old and that the charges were dropped.\n\"California Democrat Maxine Waters charged on 3 counts,\" read the headline on an Oct. 6, 2017, post on NewsOfTrump.com. The headline added a hallmark of fake news sites looking to engage an audience, asking readers, \"Do you support this?\"\nFacebook users flagged the story as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network\u2019s efforts to curb fake news. The same subject came up on other websites, as well.\nThe NewsOfTrump.com post didn\u2019t mention the charges in the headline, but specified in the text that she violated House rules by arranging a 2008 \"meeting between the Treasury Department and representatives of OneUnited bank \u2014 where her husband was a notable shareholder.\"\nThe post criticized Waters for being corrupt and said OneUnited directly benefitted from her actions.\n\"As a member of the House Financial Committee, she was able to directly contact then-Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to speak with him about meeting with minority-owned banks,\" the post read. \"Through her efforts, OneUnited bank was able to obtain $12 million in federal bailout funding to help cover expected losses from the collapse of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\"\nThese posts describe real events, when the House ethics committee charged Waters with breaking three rules by allegedly trying to assist OneUnited, in which her husband did hold a sizeable share of stock.\nBut the flap over the OneUnited meeting happened in 2010.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReports surfaced in 2009 that Waters had allegedly helped OneUnited CEO Kevin Cohee secure a meeting to ask for $50 million in bailout funds to recover from the Great Recession, triggering a House ethics investigation. (The bank did get $12 million.)\nIn August 2010, the panel recommended three charges against Waters for violating ethics rules that essentially are supposed to keep members of Congress from making the House look bad. Her chief of staff, Mikael Moore, also was charged.\nBut the posts implied or outright said that Waters is currently facing charges, making it seem as if the House had only now acted on the 2008 meeting.\nThey also don\u2019t mention that the ethics charges against Waters were dropped in 2012.\nIn contentious action between Republican and Democratic members of the committee, a lawyer hired specifically to review the case found that Waters believed she had been acting in the interest of all minority-owned banks, not just OneUnited. She had called for a meeting to help those banks, and ended her involvement when she learned OneUnited was part of the group.\nMoore was given a letter of reproval for the incident, for not stopping Waters\u2019 involvement once it was clear OneUnited was one of the banks asking for help.\nWaters is a vocal critic of President Donald Trump, which no doubt was what has earned her the attention of fake news purveyors, who typically zero in on political flashpoints. She recently earned criticism for saying she wanted to \"take Trump out\" and called him \"the most dishonorable and despicable human being to ever serve in the office of the president.\"\nAlthough based on things that really happened, the fake news posts distort the timeline and leave out the final result of the House ethics committee investigation. Someone reading it would be misinformed of the events.\nWe rate this statement Mostly False.\n Share the Facts 2017-11-02 15:21:13 UTC   PolitiFact    3 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly False  \"California Democrat Maxine Waters charged on 3 counts.\"    Internet rumors Bloggers https://newsoftrump.com/california-democrat-maxine-waters-charged-on-3-counts-do-you-support-this/   in Internet posts Friday, October 6, 2017 2017-10-06    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02737"}
