On February 25, Gillibrand said in the disclosure bill, \"9/11 Respondents continue to suffer. In the World Trade Centre health programme, 45,000 people suffer from at least one chronic health condition related to the events of 11 September. More than 10,000 have been certified with related cancer 9/11, with more diagnosis every day. \"Almost every day a responder or other survivor of the events of September 11 dies of cancer associated with the events of September 11.\" (Gilibrand), who is now campaigning for the President, has requested the assistance of 11 September from respondents and survivors for years. We were wondering if she claims that \"Almost every day a responder or another survivor of September 11 dies from a cancer associated with September 11\" is true. More than 90,000 people registered in a federal programme aimed at assisting people in health-related conditions related to the attacks of 11 September. Cancer diagnosis among respondents and survivors is still being reported on 11 September. The first responders include emergency responders, such as police, firefighters, construction and demolition workers, volunteers and others who worked on site after the attacks. It was the survivors who lived and worked in the area, or were there. According to the Government, persons living on 11 September live in all 50 states. A study published in January by Rutgers University, which runs a care clinic for World Trade Centre respondents and survivors, revealed significant increases in head and neck cancers among respondents on 11 September. Judith Graber, the main author of the study, reported in a news release that \"excessive appearance\" has been \"impossible\" since early responders inhaled debris clouds containing many known carcinogens. The Federal Government administers the 11 September Victims Compensation Fund, which paid nearly $5 billion to over 21,000 claimants suffering injuries related to the events of 11 September, and the World Trade Centre Health Programme, which monitors and addresses the circumstances related to the events of 11 September. The health programme is funded through the year 2090, but the Compensation Fund continues to receive new claims and is at risk of running out of funds if Congress does not act. Gillibrand and some of her colleagues are trying to gain support for a permanent compensation fund. The count of cases that Gillibrand's office has referred us to two people who say they have deep knowledge of respondents and survivors. The elephant founded the Phil Good, which has a memorial wall in Long Island for respondents who died of a related disease on 11 September. Since 2008, 2,000 to 2,100 respondents have died from 11 September related diseases, including cancer, respiratory problems or suicide. He said that this is the average number of people per 2.7 days. In the year ending September 1, 2018, 163 people died, or one died every 2.2 days. Since 1 September 2018, 61 respondents have died of a disease related to 11 September, or one every three days. He has an additional list of 300 persons whose families believe they died of a related disease on 11 September, but whose presence at the site of the disaster or their state of health was not confirmed before their death. Whitney Mitchell Brennan, Gelebrand spokesman, also submitted Phil's account that 2,100 people died in 17 years, or almost one every three days. On January 22, 2021, Jeremy \"Spike\" Cohen mentioned an article on Facebook in which the Paiden administration said that she was a liberal terrorist. \u2022 On January 22, 2012, the elephants suspected that many others who responded to the site had died because of diseases related to their exposure in Gwund Zero, but had not been counted. His institution is looking into deaths for 11 September, and family members of the deceased communicate with the institution on their own. However, there are likely to be 11 September related deaths that have never been brought to the attention of the institution. Persons dealing with the health effects of responding to the site may not be aware of the connection, and death certificates do not indicate the link of the deceased to 11 September. It is difficult to collect data on deaths, in part because of the lack of an official list of all those who were in, living or working near the site, as stated by Shivat, Executive Director of Health Watch on 11 September, who monitors programmes to assist persons affected by the events of 11 September and calls on behalf of respondents, survivors and their families. \"I'm convinced that there are people who die of their conditions almost every day,\" said Shivath. Shivath said there's no official estimate of those who died of September 11th-related diseases, but he bases his opinion on his knowledge of September 11th for survivors and respondents. The World Trade Centre &apos; s health programme deals with people dealing with health effects as of 11 September, but does not have a comprehensive list of every survivor or respondent, and is often not immediately notified upon the death of a patient, as Christina Spring, spokesman for the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, which manages the World Trade Centre &apos; s health programme. Data from the program show that 641 people with the September 11 cancer certificate have died since the end of 2012, but these deaths may have occurred for a reason other than cancer, as Spring said. If we start the clock in 2013, until 2018, that means a person with a certified 11 September cancer died every 3.4 days. We also contacted Dr. Iris Odassin, who is studying the health consequences of the attacks of 11 September at the University of Rutgers. She said that since Gillibrand said \"almost,\" the statement is \"reasonable\" based on her knowledge and experience. Our rule, Gillibrand, said, \"Almost every day,\" someone dies of September 11th cancer. Since there is no comprehensive official record of these deaths, we need to assess other evidence to determine the accuracy of their claim. Available data range from cancer deaths of one person to survivors and respondents every 3.4 days and every 2.7 days for all causes for respondents. The figure of 2.7 per day does not include persons who were exposed to adverse conditions because they lived or worked near the disaster zone, or respondents who died without the knowledge of an elephant. Doctors and experts working with these populations said that more data were needed to determine the frequency of cancer-related deaths on September 11. This makes known deaths at least half a repeat, as Gillibrand said, beyond the limits of \"almost,\" in our judgment. We assess Gilbrand's statement as often false.
