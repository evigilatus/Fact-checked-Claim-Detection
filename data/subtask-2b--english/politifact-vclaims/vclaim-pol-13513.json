This piece examines his assertion that the stimulus \"promised to keep unemployment under 8 percent.\"\n\nAllen, a former governor and U.S. senator, is not the only Republican peddling the claim. Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., and conservative pundit George Will have made similar statements. So did Virginia\u2019s Eric Cantor, now House Majority Leader, back in July 2009.\n\nPolitiFact has ruled that they had their facts wrong. Allen\u2019s are wrong, too. \u00a0\n\nObama warned upon taking office that if \"dramatic action\" were not taken, \"the unemployment rate could reach double digits,\" with the recession lasting years. But neither we, nor our colleagues at PolitiFact\u2019s Washington, D.C. bureau, could find evidence of anyone in the administration making a public pledge along the lines of \"if we pass the stimulus, we promise unemployment will stay below 8 percent.\"\n\nWe asked Allen\u2019s campaign for the source of the candidate\u2019s claim that that it was \"promised\" the stimulus bill would keep the unemployment rate below 8 percent. Katie Wright, Allen\u2019s director of communications, pointed us to a Jan. 9, 2009, report called \"The Job Impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan\" from Christina Romer, then chairwoman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, and Jared Bernstein, the vice president's top economic adviser. Other Republicans have also cited this as their source for past claims.\n\nTheir report projected that the stimulus plan proposed by Obama would create 3 million to 4 million jobs by the end of 2010. The study included a chart predicting unemployment rates with and without the stimulus. Without the stimulus, unemployment was projected to hit about 8.5 percent in 2009 and then continue rising to a peak of about 9 percent in 2010. With the stimulus, they predicted the unemployment rate would peak at just under 8 percent in 2009.\n\nAs we all know now, the unemployment rate went higher. It peaked at just over 10 percent in early 2010 and was at 9.4 percent in December. It fell to 9.0 percent in January.\n\nBut what we saw from the administration in January 2009 was a projection, not a promise. And it was a projection that came with heavy disclaimers.\n\n\"It should be understood that all of the estimates presented in this memo are subject to significant margins of error,\" the report states. \"There is the more fundamental uncertainty that comes with any estimate of the effects of a program. Our estimates of economic relationships and rules of thumb are derived from historical experience and so will not apply exactly in any given episode. Furthermore, the uncertainty is surely higher than normal now because the current recession is unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity.\"\n\nThere's also a footnote that goes with the chart that states: \"Forecasts of the unemployment rate without the recovery plan vary substantially. Some private forecasters anticipate unemployment rates as high as 11% in the absence of action.\"\n\nThat\u2019s not a promise. It is an estimate and an admission that these predictions may not be accurate. And the administration has acknowledged its projections were wrong.\n\nIn a July 2, 2009, interview, Romer said on Fox: \"None of us had a crystal ball back in December and January. I think almost every private forecaster realized that there were other things going on in the economy. It was worse than we anticipated.\"\n\nIn January 2009 the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected the unemployment rate would climb to 8.3 percent in 2009 and peak at 9 percent in 2010. By February, the prediction was even higher \u2014 9 percent in 2009 without the stimulus, and 7.7 to 8.5 percent with a stimulus.\n\n So, is the fact that unemployment rose, even as the stimulus unfolded, proof that it has failed?\n\nPresident Barack Obama has said, and many independent economists agree, that the stimulus has created more than a million jobs and kept the unemployment rate from going even higher than it has. In fairness, not every economist agrees with that.\n\nBut there is an inherent uncertainty in economic forecasting. And how can you ever prove that if the unemployment rate got to X percent, it would or would not have gotten a point or two higher if not for the stimulus? The implication of Allen's comment is that a rising unemployment rate in 2009 proves the stimulus didn't work. Many economists don't agree -- and argue that without the stimulus, unemployment would have been worse -- but it's difficult to empirically prove one way or the other.\n\nThe White House claimed the stimulus would improve the employment picture and applied that to the baseline for projected unemployment going forward. Allen and other Republicans argue Obama was offering some sort of guarantee the stimulus would keep the unemployment rate below 8 percent.\n\nThe administration never characterized it that way. True, it\u2019s projections were off, but the report contained plenty of disclaimers saying the predictions had \"significant margins of error\" and a higher degree of uncertainty due to a recession that is \"unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity.\" In short, it was an economic projection with warnings of a high margin for error, not a guarantee on an upper limit on unemployment.\n\nAllen is recycling a claim that should go to the dump. We rate his statement Barely True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Boysko\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in a committee debate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe United States is the only industrialized, modernized country that does not already have a paid family medical leave program in place.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEditor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.
