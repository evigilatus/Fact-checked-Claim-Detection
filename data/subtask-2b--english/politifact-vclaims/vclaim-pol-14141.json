John Boccieri\u2019s election, \"Ohio has lost 600,000 jobs\" and his district\u2019s \"unemployment has doubled.\"", "truth_label": "pants-fire", "date": "stated on October 18, 2010 in a debate:", "title": "GOP challenger Jim Renacci joins the chorus on job losses but mangles the refrain", "text": "Once more, with spirit: Ohio has lost a whole lot of jobs.\n\nIt\u2019s the chorus line of 2010, and if the Capital Steps were in Ohio they would sing it as an encore.\n\nImagine our surprise, then, when we heard a sonorous new version last week from congressional candidate and businessman Jim Renacci. The Wadsworth Republican, running against Democratic incumbent John Boccieri, said in opening remarks of a debate in Canton:\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, our country is going in the wrong direction. What we\u2019ve learned is that over the last couple of years, Ohio has lost over 600,000 jobs.\" He added that \"Since Mr. Boccieri has become a representative of the 16th District, unemployment has doubled.\"\n\nThat figure \u2013 600,000 \u2013 is roughly double to triple the number that others have cited as they challenge Ohio Democrats holding office. The sums change depending on the month and year, but Renacci\u2019s figure seemed outlandishly high to our numerically attuned ears.\n\nThat\u2019s because it is.\n\nUsing figures from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, we found that from January 2009, when Boccieri took office, through August 2010, the most recent month counted when Renacci made his claim, Ohio lost 176,400 jobs. New data that included September came out after the debate, and if counted it would put Ohio\u2019s job losses during the current Congress at 194,300.\n\nIt would be impossible for Renacci\u2019s number to be correct no matter how you measured \"the last two years,\" unless BLS data \u2013 the gold standard for statisticians -- was off by 300-plus percent. \u00a0\n\nPerplexed, we asked Renacci\u2019s spokesman, James Slepian, how his boss got his number. Slepian responded that while Renacci said the state has lost 600,000 jobs over the last couple of years, his number was actually in reference to Ohio\u2019s unemployment rate, not its job losses. Stick with us here, because this is a distinction with a definite difference.\n\nThe unemployment rate measures the number and percentage of people at any given time who say they are out of work and are actively looking for a job. It doesn\u2019t matter when they lost their jobs.\n\nThat\u2019s different \u2013 and typically much higher -- from the number of jobs lost during a specific period, which is measured in a survey of employers. \u00a0\n\nIf you counted every Ohioan looking for work, regardless of when he or she lost a job, the number would come to 601,145 as of August, which again was the most current number during the debate. It\u2019s now come down a tad, to 590,809, BLS databases show..\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of unemployed people, to be sure. But most of them were already out of work when Boccieri became a congressman. In fact, the number in Ohio was already 515,292 when Boccieri took his oath of office.\n\nSo while the trend continued while Boccieri has been in office, the magnitude is not the result of the last couple of years, as Renacci said, and in fact has shown a small reversal in recent months. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nThis brings us to Renacci\u2019s related point \u2013 that since Boccieri \"became a representative\" of the 16th Congressional District, \"unemployment has doubled.\"\n\nNo, it hasn\u2019t.\n\nThis, too, can be measured a number of ways, and we tried a bunch.\n\nWe started by looking at the Canton-Massillon metropolitan statistical area since that\u2019s the heart of the district\u2019s population center. The current rate of unemployment there is 10.6 percent.\n\nThe number is nothing to cheer. But the rate was 10.2 when Boccieri took office, which is not even close to the doubling that Renacci claimed.\n\nWe asked Slepian to explain how his boss arrived at this claim, too. Slepian said that Renacci was not using just the Canton metro area but, rather, the four-county area that makes up his district: Stark, Wayne, Ashland and Medina counties.\n\nWith Slepian on the phone, we joined him in going over the numbers as we turned our respective cursors to the BLS databases. He noted accurately that in Stark County, the unemployment rate just before Boccieri\u2019s election, in October 2008, was 6.8 percent. And in January 2010, it reached 13.6 percent, which is exactly double.\n\nTwo problems. First, Boccieri was sworn in in January, 2009, and Stark County\u2019s unemployment rate was already 10.0 by then. Second, Renacci seemed to stop flipping through the calendar awfully early to get to his claim. Had he counted every month that Boccieri has been in office, he would have stopped at August 2010, the most recent month for which there is countywide data, rather than stopping in January.\n\nGuess what? The unemployment rate for the most recent month available was 10.5 in Stark County, not 13.6. Things improved, it seems, when Renacci stopped counting.\n\nWe did the same kinds of calculations for the district\u2019s three other counties, and the result were similarly at odds with Renecci\u2019s doubling claim. In fact, were he to measure Ashland County alone, he\u2019d have to say that on Boccieri\u2019s watch, the unemployment rate actually went down, from 12.2 at the start to 10.4 in August.\n\nThis looked like a classic case of cherry picking the data to support a false claim, and we told Slepian as much. He maintained that statewide, the unemployment rate is higher than it was two years ago, and that no matter how you slice it, \"there are 600,000 people out of work in the state.\" And he said that when looking at certain periods in the last two years \u2013 a month before Boccieri\u2019s election (but three before his inauguration) and 12 months into his term -- \"we did see it double\" in the district\u2019s biggest county.\n\n\"It\u2019s an accurate statement to say that that\u2019s what it went up to since he was elected to office,\" Slepian said.\n\nYes, it is, but only if you ignore the fact that it has come way down since Renacci stopped turning the calendar pages at exactly the right date to shore up his argument. To include months when an opponent wasn\u2019t in office, and to stop counting when the unemployment numbers make your case, leaves out a massive amount of information and context.\n\nDid we mention that Renacci is a CPA?\n\nIf we tried these tricks on our taxes, we could be treated to a heap of IRS trouble (although with a creative accountant, you never know). But the Truth-O-Meter does not assess tax penalties; it merely points its arrow to the only rating possible when a claim is inaccurate and its basis is distorted and contorted: Pants on Fire!\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-14141"}
