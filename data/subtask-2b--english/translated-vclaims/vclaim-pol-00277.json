There have been numerous mass shootings since the Trump elections, including two during 24 hours last weekend in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio. \"I think the National Republican Army has been badly hurt by this,\" said Bloomberg. Nine percent of the members of the National Republican Army support background checks, so the National Republican Army is not in place for most of its members. In fact, if you return, you can see Wayne Lapierre, who runs the National Republican Army, testifying before Congress in favour of background investigations 15 or 20 years ago.\" Relevant: \"Do most members of the National Revolutionary Army support the verification of weapons background?\" Bloomberg made almost the same allegation about Lapierre &apos; s testimony in 2013. Former President Barack Obama also did. It's still accurate. We wanted to revisit history in the light of the usually strong resistance of the National Republican Army to arms control efforts, and the recent Washington Post report, which called on Lapiere Trump to warn against pressure to check the background. On 27 May 1999, a month after the shooting of the Colombian secondary school, Lapierre testified before the Crime Sub-Committee of the Judicial Committee of the Chamber of Deputies. Lapierre, also the then Chief Executive, mentioned a number of arms-related acts and laws that the Group believed would be \"reasonable.\" The mandatory background check on the arms shows was the same. \"We believe it reasonable to provide a mandatory immediate background check for every sale in every weapons gallery,\" he said. \"No holes anywhere for anyone.\" On January 13, 2021, General David Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for the use of marines for security, and said to her, \"We are not working for you.\" \"This is not new, change of position, or waiver. This point has been consistently recorded, from our national meeting in Denver, to national announcements and position papers, to news interviews and press appearances.\" \"We believe that it is reasonable to provide for the immediate verification of weapons in offers, just as in arms shops and pawnshops,\" Lapierre said, wrote a message at the heart of a national Republican Army advertising campaign that year. In 2013, Lapierre and the Norwegian Home Army acknowledged the change in attitude. In a hearing held by the Senate in January that year - this time after a mass shooting at Sandy Hawk Primary School in Newtown, Con. - Mr. Patrick Lehe, D-Vt, Laper asked about his 1999 background check. Leah asked if the U.S. had to check her background mandatory at arms fairs to sell weapons. \"Senator, I don't think, the way the law now operates, unfortunately, is that it would be useful to extend the scope of the law to private sales between amateurs and collectors,\" Lapierre said. In response to the follow-up, he added: \"We do not (support mandatory background checks in arms offers), because the fact is that the law is now a failure in the way it operates.\" Also in January 2013, National Broadcasting Authority member Sandy Foran said to CNN, \"The National Broadcasting Corporation has changed its position, and the reason it has changed its position is that the system is not working.\" In addition, on 12 March 2013, the National Republican Army indicated its opposition to background checks on its website: \"The National Republican Army opposes the criminalization of transfers of private firearms among law-abiding individuals, and therefore against the expansion of the background verification system.\" Our rule Bloomberg said, \"If you return, you can see Wayne Lapierre, who runs the National Republican Army, testifying in front of Congress in favour of background investigations 15 or 20 years ago.\" In 1999, testifying before Congress, Lapierre said, \"We believe it reasonable to provide a mandatory immediate background check for every sale at every weapons gallery.\" Subsequent statements by Lapierre and other National News Agency officials acknowledged that the organization &apos; s position on background verification had since changed. We appreciate that Bloomberg's statement is correct.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00277"}
