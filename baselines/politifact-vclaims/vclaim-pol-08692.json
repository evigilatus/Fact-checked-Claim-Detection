Barton says", "text": "With a host of technical problems at the healthcare.gov website, critics of President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law have gone on the offensive.\nAmong the claims we've heard recently, Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, said people visiting healthcare.gov are unwittingly waiving their privacy rights.\nBarton told\u00a0Fox News that there's a problem in the source code that seems to contradict HIPAA, the 1996 law that, among other things, protects the privacy of patients\u2019 sensitive data.\n\"Hidden in the code, there is a sentence that says you waive any reasonable right to privacy of your personal information, the transiting of it or the storage of it,\" Barton said.\nWe decided to take a peek under healthcare.gov\u2019s hood to see if Barton, the chairman emeritus of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, was right that people are waiving their privacy rights if they use the site.\nThe source code\nBarton\u2019s spokesman sent us the code he referenced during the hearing. It\u2019s the same code the Washington Post published with their own analysis. This is the website\u2019s HTML markup, which is the main language developers use to write websites.\nThe line in question reads, \"You have no reasonable expectation of privacy regarding any communication or data transiting or stored on this information system.\"\nThere\u2019s a couple of important HTML symbols around that section of the code, on lines 1406 and 1411. The section starts with a <!-- and ends with -->. That means all the content in between is \"commented out,\" a web development term that tells everything enclosed to not display on the user\u2019s screen.\nClay Johnson, the founder of the company that built President Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 online campaign, said it\u2019s a common technique for developers who want to delete something from a site\u2019s appearance without permanently losing it.\nThe text is also a standard disclaimer for government websites, as an advanced Google search Johnson ran pointed out. It could\u2019ve been easily copied by a developer as placeholder text.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHogan Gidley\n\n\nstated on January 17, 2021 in a Fox News interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump \u201ccan\u2019t say anything (about the U.S. Capitol riot) because the platforms have removed him.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 18, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpokeswoman Linda Odorisio of CGI Federal, one of the main government contractors that built the site and was responsible for that portion of code, told us that line wasn\u2019t meant to be in the code at all. Rather, it was meant for exchange employees who have access to consumer data.\n\"It informs them that their interaction with data in the system is monitored and tracked to ensure consumer privacy,\" she said.\nConsumer privacy\nBarton pulled up the code at the hearing as a way of backing up his claim that healthcare.gov isn\u2019t compliant with HIPAA regulations on privacy.\nParts of Obama\u2019s law must be compliant with HIPAA, but not the website itself, since HIPAA covers health care providers, health plans and health care clearinghouses.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the site doesn\u2019t have privacy regulations in place, as we\u2019ve noted before. The Affordable Care Act outlines processes for ensuring privacy and complying with existing privacy regulations.\nAs for the \"hidden\" code, users can\u2019t legally accept a waiver they can\u2019t see, so they can\u2019t possibly be waiving their right to privacy.\nThe Department of Health and Human Services, the agency that oversees the marketplace, referred us to the site\u2019s privacy policy, which addresses what officials can and can\u2019t do with your sensitive information. They can use what you input only to confirm your eligibility to buy a marketplace premium.\nIn other words, the lines inserted in the code may be embarrassing, but they carry no legal weight.\n\"It\u2019s bizarre and kind of sad to see that that would even be put in there as a comment note because that doesn\u2019t accurately represent the privacy protections in place,\" said Christopher Rasmussen, a Health Privacy Project senior policy analyst.\nOur ruling\nBarton claimed healthcare.gov has \"hidden\" code indicating that consumers waive their rights to privacy when they apply for insurance. The website\u2019s markup does include a sentence along these lines that isn\u2019t visible to the user. But because it\u2019s not displayed to the public, it carries no legal weight and consumers can\u2019t consent to it. Bottom line, it doesn\u2019t change a thing about the privacy protections in place at healthcare.gov. We rate Barton\u2019s claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08692"}
