This legislation, in fact, outlawed any registry. Plain and simple, right there in the text. But that didn't matter.\"\n\nThe background check amendment, sponsored by Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa., was a compromise intended to replace stricter language in Majority Leader Harry Reid\u2019s Safe Communities, Safe Schools Act of 2013.\n\nDid it, in fact, outlaw any gun registry?\n\n\u2018A path to a national gun registry\u2019\n\nThe government requires background checks for gun sales by licensed firearms dealers \u2014 but not for sales between folks who aren\u2019t in the business of selling guns.\n\nManchin and Toomey\u2019s amendment expanded the background check requirement to sales at gun shows and those advertised in publications and on the Web. But it didn\u2019t go as far as the original bill, which required background checks for all gun transfers with limited exceptions.\n\nThat compromise wasn\u2019t enough to attract the 60-vote supermajority required to pass the amendment. It failed on a 54 to 46 vote.\n\nOpponents had, indeed, raised the specter of a national gun registry.\n\n\"If your private gun transaction is covered by Toomey-Schumer-Manchin (and virtually all will be) ... you can assume you will be part of a national gun registry,\" wrote Michael Hammond of lobbying group Gun Owners of America.\n\nThe existing background checks require filling out ATF Form 4473. That personal information is then run through the FBI\u2019s National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The government is supposed to destroy personally identifying information, but gun dealers are required to store the forms.\n\nThe government is then allowed to inspect them in the course of criminal investigations or to ensure gun dealers keep the records they\u2019re supposed to keep.\n\nSo what did the Manchin-Toomey amendment say about a registry?\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, it made reference to federal law that already bans creation of a federal registry.\n\nSince the mid 1980s, it\u2019s been against federal law for information from background checks to be \"recorded at or transferred to a facility owned, managed, or controlled by the United States or any State or any political subdivision thereof, nor that any system of registration of firearms, firearms owners, or firearms transactions or dispositions be established.\"\n\nThat\u2019s why, if you\u2019re cleared to purchase a gun, the FBI is required to destroy all identifying information about you before the next business day.\n\nThe Manchin-Toomey amendment doubled down on this ban, declaring: \"Congress supports and reaffirms the existing prohibition on a national firearms registry.\"\n\nIt also declared that nothing in the legislation should be construed to \"allow the establishment, directly or indirectly, of a federal firearms registry.\"\n\nLater, it added these provisions:\n\n\u2022 \"The Attorney General shall be prohibited from seizing any records or other documents in the course of an inspection or examination authorized by this paragraph other than those records or documents constituting material evidence of a violation of law.\"\n\n\u2022 \"The Attorney General may not consolidate or centralize the records of the ... acquisition or disposition of firearms, or any portion thereof.\"\n\n\u2022 \"Any person who knowingly violates (the prohibition against consolidating or centralizing records) shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 15 years, or both.''\n\nSo, the amendment prohibited the centralizing of federal records \u2014 and added the threat of prison.\n\nBut those protections didn\u2019t reassure gun rights proponents.\n\nThe National Rifle Association argues that gun control supporters believe expanding background checks is a precursor to gun confiscation. An Arizona gun group spokesman told us the federal government would illegally collect background check information submitted to the FBI. Sarah Palin, arguing against the Toomey-Manchin amendment, said it \"creates a path to a national gun registry\" since dealers store background check forms and the bill didn\u2019t explicitly ban copying them, storing them in various locations (rather than centrally), or keeping a list of them.\n\nShe didn\u2019t mention that existing federal law \u2014 referenced by the bill \u2014 already prohibits \"any system of registration of firearms, firearms owners, or firearms transactions or dispositions.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nObama said opponents of compromise gun legislation \"claimed that it would create some sort of \u2018big brother\u2019 gun registry, even though the bill did the opposite. This legislation, in fact, outlawed any registry. Plain and simple, right there in the text.\" The Manchin-Toomey amendment referenced a registry ban already in federal law, then expanded it, prohibiting seizure of records, forbidding the attorney general from consolidating or centralizing records, and providing for fines and imprisonment for anyone who did consolidate or centralize records.
