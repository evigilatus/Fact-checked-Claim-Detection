But given that the Republican presidential hopefuls are already meeting for weekly debates, we probably shouldn\u2019t be surprised that Our Oregon, a progressive political organization, is already laying the way for its get-out-the-vote effort.\n\nOur Oregon\u2019s website makes a call to arms: \"The need for voter registration is constant, especially in Oregon. With our vote-by-mail system, the people least likely to be registered to vote (young people, low-income people) are the ones most likely to get knocked off the rolls each year.\"\n\nThen they put that need in perspective. According to Our Oregon, overall voter registration is down by more than 119,000 voters from the peak in November 2008.\n\n\"That\u2019s like losing a voter every 13 minutes,\" the site concludes.\n\nThat statistic caught our eye. Could Oregon, which traditionally has high voter participation, really be hemorrhaging one voter every 13 minutes?\n\nWe gave Our Oregon a call and they told us they\u2019d simply compared the number of voters registered in November 2008 to the most recent registration figures. These can all be found on the Oregon Secretary of State\u2019s website. We followed suit.\n\nAccording to monthly statistics, there were 2,154,288 voters on our rolls back in November 2008. (It\u2019s important to note here that this number represents active voters. If a ballot gets kicked back to the county with an incorrect address, the voter is deemed inactive. That doesn\u2019t mean those voters aren\u2019t registered, just that they need to update their info with the state before their next vote.)\n\nAnyhow, back to our analysis: The most recent voter statistics come from September, showing 2,034,589 registered voters. (Again, of the active variety.)\n\nTake the latter from the former, and about 119,000 voters have slipped off the registers.\n\nThere were about 1,060 days separating Election Day 2008 and the end of September 2011. If you put that into the number of missing voters, you get about 113 fewer registered voters each day. Take the number of minutes in a day -- 1440 -- and divide it by 113 and you do, in fact, get 13 minutes.\n\nNow, the figures seem to hold up. But one of the things we love to do with PolitiFact is offer up some context.\n\nWhen we thought about the dip in the number of registered voters, it occurred to us that registration a year before a presidential election is probably always a little anemic. (Observant, right?)\n\nSo we pulled the figures and compared November 2007 to November 2008. We found that registers grew by more than 210,000 over that year. Same for November 2003 and 2004. During that period, registration actually grew by more than 260,000.\n\nJust to make sure we got the whole picture, we also checked the percent of eligible voters who were actually registered. During the 2010 election, an estimated 72 percent of eligible voters were registered, according to our secretary of state. That was down 5 percent from the 2008 presidential election.\n\nBut even that dip seems fairly standard. In November 2006, the registration was down to 73 percent. But in November 2004 it had been 82 percent.\n\nThis is all to say that during presidential election years, registration surges. We\u2019re not saying Our Oregon got its math wrong. We are saying that the current drop isn\u2019t anything special.\n\nFor the last word on all of this we talked to Barry Pack, Oregon\u2019s deputy secretary of state. He said that the figures Our Oregon cited were all accurate, but that it\u2019s important to remember that there are many reasons why the number of registered voters might decline.\n\nAccording to a state analysis comparing registration in November 2008 and 2010, about 70 percent of the 250,000-voter decline is attributable to voter inactivity for two federal elections. The other loss came from voter death, ineligibility, moving and other reasons.\n\nMany of the folks in that 30 percent, Pack said, \"are not an indication of lack of civic engagement.\"\n\nWe circled back with Our Oregon and talked with spokesman Scott Moore, who said he didn\u2019t think our research negated the point that the organization was trying to make, which is that registration needs to get ramped up -- as always.\n\nThat brings us to our ruling. Our Oregon said we\u2019ve lost about 119,000 since November 2008 -- one every 13 minutes -- and official figures back them up. The thing is, without the context that this is a pretty cyclical happening, that statistic sounds pretty dire. We think it needs context, so under PolitiFact rules, we\u2019ll give it a Mostly True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you think?
