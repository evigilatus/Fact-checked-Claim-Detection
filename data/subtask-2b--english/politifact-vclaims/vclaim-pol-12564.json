Rick Perry said: \"Now you tell me whether this is true or not. But one of my fellas just told me, he said that they're talking about a new regulation that if you drive your tractor ... across one public road, you're going to have to have a commercial driver's license. Get out of here! You're kiddin' me. I mean, what are they thinking?\"\n\nThe former cotton farmer and Texas agriculture commissioner sounded more certain by the next morning, saying in remarks excerpted on CNN\u2019s Aug. 15 \"Newsroom\": \"Let me give you just a \u2014 this is such an obscene, crazy regulation. They want to make \u2014 if you are a tractor driver, if you drive your tractor across a public road, you are going to have to have a commercial driver's license. Now, how idiotic is that?\"\n\nAttention drawn! We looked into who\u2019s wanting to impose such a mandate and found that such a proposal popped up this year in Illinois. But after the federal government declared last week that it does not plan new rules affecting farm vehicles, the Illinois plans were shelved, according to Guy Tridgell, a spokesman for the Illinois agency. \"That issue is null and void,\" Tridgell told us.\n\nRewind: An Aug. 11, 2011, press release from the U.S. Department of Transportation says the agency\u2019s Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration reviewed farm-vehicle regulations this year in an effort \"to make sure states don't go overboard in enforcing regulations on agricultural operators.\" At issue, the release says, was whether some states might view tenant farmers as common or contract carriers and as not exempt like other farmers from state commercial driver\u2019s license requirements.\n\nThe vast majority of about 1,700 public comments the agency received in response \"called for us to preserve the guidance that leaves states to carry out the farm exceptions as they have for many years,\" said the agency\u2019s administrator, Anne Ferro. \"We want to make crystal clear that we are not imposing any new regulations.\"\n\nJohn Porcari, deputy secretary for the federal Transportation Department, told us that Illinois\u2019 move toward requiring tenant farmers to have commercial driver\u2019s licenses, which \"defied common sense,\" touched off the government\u2019s May request for wide public comment. That request, he said, was then widely and erroneously interpreted as a signal the agency was contemplating new transportation mandates for farmers.\n\nThe result, Porcari said, was \"a bit of agricultural legend. Some people said we were attempting to require commercial driver licenses\" in situations including a tractor crossing a road. \"That wasn\u2019t and isn\u2019t the case,\" he said. \"We are not, repeat not, requiring\" them.\n\nWhy did even the suggestion of regulations cause a stir among farmers?\n\nAn Aug. 11, 2011, analysis by columnist Ken Root of the (Dodge City, Kan.) High Plains Journal summed up the issue. He noted that farmers have enjoyed exemptions from commercial driver regulations put in place by a 1986 federal act establishing the commercial driver's license to regulate truck drivers nationwide.\n\nChange is likely, Root writes: \"As more sectors of the transportation industry are required to comply with regulations, farmers are less likely to remain exempt because they are seen as holding an economic advantage over the commercial haulers.\n\n\"In grain-producing areas, literally all farms of any size have a semi-trailer grain truck,\" Root\u2019s column says. \"They use it to haul to the local elevator or farther away (even across state lines) if the price is higher. They haul for several months each year and get in the dump line with commercial operators yet they don't pay the same registration for their vehicles. That creates animosity and an opening for regulatory agencies to argue that one standard should be imposed on all vehicles and all drivers.\"\n\nRoot\u2019s column, published before the federal announcement, says that Illinois is \"targeting farmer-owned trucks to gain more revenue. The argument is that one standard should exist for all uses of a vehicle and equivalent fees should be paid.\"\n\nHours after he made the statement we\u2019re checking here, Perry told the Des Moines Register that he\u2019d based his declaration on information from U.S. Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa. \"Senator Grassley, when I asked him about it last night \u2014 I\u2019ve got to go with your senior senator,\" Perry said. The newspaper said Perry\u2019s staff, \"checking their BlackBerrys, said it might be a recent development that federal transportation officials dropped the idea.\"\n\nThe newspaper said Grassley, referring to the federal announcement, wrote in an electronic newsletter last week that common sense had appeared to prevail in the matter.\n\nFar as we can tell, the regulation questioned by Perry hasn't even been proposed at the federal level. We rate his statement False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 30, 2021 in a blog post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cTrump assassination foiled, Deep State in panic mode!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 February 4, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-12564"}
