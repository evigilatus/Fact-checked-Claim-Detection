The Fox News character is currently on a publicity tour of his new book Patton's murder, the fourth batch in the non-fiction series of Fox's host. In Fox News Paz, O'Reilly spoke about his ability to attract a large television audience. Kurtz O'Reily asked whether he was willing to stop referring to himself as \"a lone stranger\" since he appeared in the late show with David Litterman and chatting with the host of major news such as Katie Korrick of Yahoo. News and ABC George Stefanopoulos. Is he one of them now? \"It's not a question of acceptance, it's a question of success,\" O'Reilly's explanation. \"And I bring estimates to those programs. So when I go on Litterman or I go on morning shows, their rates rise. That's why they're putting me on the phone.\" And because we were curious, we asked about O'Reily's ability to evaluate when he appeared in other programs. We focused on the late Letterman program to make the exercise more manageable. We found 15 appearances in O'Reilly Late Show since 2001 using the IMDB database and search copies. Then we pulled data on the estimated number of viewers for those presentations from Nielsen Media Research, a company that follows consumer patterns and television. We measured the number of viewers who saw the appearance of O'Reilly as compared to the average viewers who saw the same day of the week that season, as well as the average annual calendar of late performances. Some data evasions: CBS provided Nielsen data to viewers on average days of the week in terms of broadcast years, which range from September to September and include recurrent programmes. Nielsen provided medium viewers for the calendar year, with the exception of special materials and repetition. The show is five nights a week, including repetition, so we don't think it's a big deal. Some 2014 classifications are also not available because Nelson is still reassessing his data following an error in reporting on broadcasting networks since the last seven months. In the graph below, we have continued to show that O'Reilly's estimates are higher than the average days of the week for the season or the annual average. As you can see, O'Reilly is quite right: it usually exceeds the seasonal average of viewers on the days of the week as well as the average of the calendar year. On 23 February 2001, on the annual average of seasonal viewers for the season: 4.80 million - 1.4.26 million 4.27 million 4 October 2004, Tuesday, 3.51 million 2004-05 3.85 million 4.45 million January 3, Tuesday, 2006, $4.39 million 2005-06 3.63 million 4.16 million October 27 October 2006, Friday, 4.79 million 3.83 million 4.16 million October 27 October 2008, Monday, 3.77 million 2008-09 3.79 million $3.63 million 31 March 2009, Tuesday, 4.06 million 2008-09 3.66 million 3.80 million Krue in a television segment that says that Joe Paiden is \"participated\" in electoral fraud in \"recognition.\" By 12 January, 2021 December, 9 September 2010, 4.08 million - 11.3.29 million 3.55 million 3 October, 13 October 2011, 3.43 million - 12 3.06 million 3.34 million 3 May 2012 As at 27 October 2008, the number of viewers was approximately 140,000 higher than the average calendar year, but about 20,000 fewer than the average of two during the 2008-2009 season. In other words, the programmes in which O'Reily wrote a recent book or presented a political comment exceeded the average day of the week and calendar year by 70 per cent of the time. CBS will not comment on whether he calls O'Reily to strengthen the classifications. Our judgment at the moment of a brand of unconscionability, O'Reilly boasts of his influence as a guest star in regular broadcasts. \"I bring estimates to those programs. So when I go on Litterman or I go on morning shows, their ratings rise,\" he said. And that's why we shouldn't learn from it. Using the available data, we found that O'Reilly overcame the average estimates for the comparative day of the week and calendar year 10 or 11 times out of 14 shows appearances with data. In this particular case, the detention of O'Reily is not a sure bet for better estimates. But it's very safe. We assess his claim mostly true.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07110"}
