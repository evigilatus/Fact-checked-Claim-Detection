Sherrod Brown of Ohio. Look-alike versions aired in other states target four other Democratic senators.\nPolitiFact already has run several of Boone\u2019s claims in the ad through the Truth-O-Meter.\n\nA statement that an independent payment advisory board created by the health care act \"can ration care and deny certain Medicare treatments\" was rated Pants on Fire, as was the claim that the IPAB is \"like a Medicare IRS with the power to cut Medicare in order to pay for new government programs.\" And the statement that the health care law \"will cut $500 billion from Medicare\" was rated Mostly False.\n\nThat leaves us with another alarming assertion: \"Medicare will be bankrupt in nine years, but Washington politicians, like Sherrod Brown, are ignoring the problem, putting their own re-elections first.\"\n\nThe second part of the statement is subjective political rhetoric that we can't rate.\n\nWe can, however, examine the foundation of the claim about Medicare going bankrupt.\n\nPolitiFact Ohio won\u2019t try to predict the future. But the claim about Medicare going bankrupt isn\u2019t a predictions as a result of an ideological debate. Rather, it\u2019s rooted in research and projections by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\n\n60 Plus cited two reports from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office when we asked about the claim.\n\nThe CBO's \"March 2011 Medicare Baseline,\" 60 Plus said, \"estimated that the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund would be exhausted in 2021.\" Another CBO report, the \"Budget and Economic Outlook\" for fiscal 2012 to 2022,\" estimated that the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund would be exhausted by early 2022,\" it said.\n\nThat's true -- and it's not what Boone says in the ad.\n\nThe Hospital Insurance Trust Fund to which the reports refer is one of two separate trust funds run by the federal government for Medicare.\n\nThis trust fund, which collects most of its money from federal payroll taxes, pays for one of four parts of Medicare, Part A, which covers inpatient hospital care, home health care, and services at skilled nursing facilities and hospices.\n\nThe other trust fund is the Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund. It is mostly covered by the federal government\u2019s general fund and premiums and pays bills for Medicare Part B, which covers doctor visits and other outpatient costs, and Part D, which covers prescription drugs.\n\nMedicare Advantage, or Part C, gives recipients the option to receive care through private insurers. It doesn\u2019t have a trust fund.\n\nThe Supplementary Medical Insurance fund is in good shape. It is \"projected to remain in financial balance for all future years,\" according to a 2011 report by the fund\u2019s trustees.\n\nThe Hospital Insurance fund does have big problems, but that's not the same thing as being \"bankrupt,\" \u00a0a legal term of art that doesn\u2019t apply to federal governmental programs.\n\nA report by the Congressional Research Service leaves open the question of what would happen if the Hospital Insurance fund were to run out of money.\n\n\"There are no provisions in the Social Security Act governing what would happen in such an event,\" the report says. \"There is no authority in law for a general revenue funding of the shortfall. The fund would continue to have payroll taxes credited to it though these would be insufficient to pay all the pending claims.\"\n\nBut the CRS report also notes that the Hospital Insurance trust fund has faced a projected shortfall \"almost from its inception.\"\n\nIn 1970, when the program was only four years old, the insolvency date was 1972. For the next 16 years, trustees expected the fund to be exhausted by the 1990s.\n\nCongress repeatedly changed legislation to lower fund spending and keep it from going dry. (\"Baseline\" projections are made with the assumption that current laws and formulas remain unchanged.)\n\nOur colleagues at FactCheck.org wrote in 2009 about a TV ad for another conservative group, Americans for Prosperity, which predicted Medicare would be bankrupt in eight years -- \u00a05 1/2 years from now. They checked a nearly identical claim of bankruptcy by Rep. Paul Ryan a year ago.\n\nIn both cases, FactCheck said, the claim \"goes too far.\"\n\nAgain, we won\u2019t try to predict the future. But for this claim, we don\u2019t have to.\n\n60 Plus cited reports showing that Medicare's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund faces insolvency in nine years. And while it\u2019s worth noting that Congress has always pulled the fund from the brink of insolvency, and that insolvency has been forecast almost from the program\u2019s start, that\u2019s an event in the future that we won\u2019t try to predict.\n\nWhat we do know from research that 60 Plus cited is that that Boone\u2019s claim -- that Medicare will be bankrupt in nine years -- takes a projection for one trust fund and applies it to all of Medicare.\n\nBy doing so, Boone\u2019s claim overstates what the CBO reports forecast.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBetty Sutton\n\n\nstated on September 1, 2010 in a campaign fundraising e-mail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Ganley said that if elected, he wants to \u2018cut the dickens\u2019 out of Social Security, Medicare and Veterans\u2019 benefits.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Sabrina Eaton \u2022 September 20, 2010\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Hospital Insurance Trust Fund supports just one of the four parts of Medicare.
