The ad even says its claims represent Obama's \"true agenda.\" (The Sarasota newspaper has apologized for publishing the ad, saying it did not meet the paper's \"standards for fairness and accuracy.\")\n\nIn the claim about hiring teachers, Murray offered two articles that indicated it was largely based on on a Supreme Court case, Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School vs. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. \n\nThe case involved a teacher at a Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod school named Cheryl Perich, a \"called\" teacher trained in theological requirements who taught mostly secular courses as well as some religious ones. In 2004 she developed narcolepsy and started the school year on leave with a disability. She wanted to return to the classroom in 2005, but the principal said the school had already filled the position for the year and had concerns about her illness.\n\nThe congregation asked Perich to resign, offering her a \"peaceful release\" from her call. She wouldn\u2019t, and eventually the church fired her for insubordination and also for threatening legal action against the church. She filed an EEOC complaint that asserted she lost her job in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n\nThe Supreme Court, in a 9-0 decision on Jan. 11, 2012, ruled that her lawsuit should have been dismissed under the First Amendment\u2019s \"ministerial exception\" protection for religious organizations to make their own decisions about their leaders.\n\n\"The church must be free to choose those who will guide it on its way,\" wrote Chief Justice John Roberts in the opinion.\n\nThe federal government was a party to the case -- the solicitor general\u2019s office filed a brief and made an oral argument on behalf of the losing side. And so the Government Is Not God PAC is relying on the government's arguments as evidence for the ad\u2019s claim that Obama will \"force Christian schools to hire non-Christian teachers.\"\n\nThis raises two questions. First, if the solicitor general\u2019s office makes an argument before the Supreme Court, does that mean that the arguments are those of Obama himself? And second, did the federal government actually argue in Hosanna-Tabor that the government has the right to \"force Christian schools to hire non-Christian teachers\"?\n\nWe\u2019ll take these two issues in order.\n\nDoes Obama \"own\" the Supreme Court arguments made by federal officials?\n\nExperts told us this is a bit of a gray area.\n\nOn the one hand, \"the solicitor general is tasked with representing the United States and not solely the president of the United States,\" said Douglas W. Kmiec, a constitutional law professor at Pepperdine University and a former Justice Department official in the Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations. \"It is therefore erroneous to ascribe the views of the solicitor general to those of the administration.\" There is a strong tradition, he said, \"for the solicitor general to give an objective reading of the law.\"\n\nIn addition, this case involved a federal statute and a federal agency, which gives a strong presumption that the federal government -- regardless of who occupied the White House -- would get involved, said Douglas Laycock, a law professor at the University of Virginia who argued against the government\u2019s position at the Supreme Court oral argument for Hosanna-Tabor.\n\n\"The federal agency had won the case in the court of appeals, and the solicitor general pretty much had to defend that win,\" Laycock said. \"This was not an administration decision. \u2026 Occasionally, in very high-profile litigation, the White House gets involved and tells the solicitor general what to argue. But that is a rare event, and I don\u2019t believe it happened here.\"\n\nThat said, some legal experts said that the administration can\u2019t fully disown what the solicitor general\u2019s office was arguing. For one thing, it is not unprecedented for an administration to decline to defend a federal law (the Obama administration has already taken that course with the Defense of Marriage Act). It did not do so in this case.\n\nAnd even if the solicitor general\u2019s office didn\u2019t have much choice about taking the case, it would have had some latitude in the specific arguments it would make. \"The solicitor general has some discretion in terms of the position to take,\" said Kermit Roosevelt, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nDid the government argue that it had the right to \"force Christian schools to hire non-Christian teachers\"?\n\nThere\u2019s some nuance here, too.\n\nOn the one hand, the administration took a more aggressive stance on behalf of government prerogatives in church-related conflicts than some legal observers had expected. Indeed, it was a view that was so aggressive that it was rejected by a unanimous court, including two appointees of Obama himself.\n\nRichard W. Garnett, a University of Notre Dame law professor who wrote a brief countering the government\u2019s view in Hosanna-Tabor, calls the solicitor general\u2019s arguments in the brief and oral argument \"extreme and misguided.\" The solicitor general\u2019s argument, he said, was that the plaintiffs should be able to use federal discrimination laws to challenge employment decisions by Christian schools regarding teachers, and that the First Amendment\u2019s religion clauses do not provide any shield against government second-guessing of such decisions. \u00a0\n\n\"At oral argument, \u2018liberal\u2019 and \u2018conservative\u2019 justices alike were surprised\" at the reach of the government\u2019s argument, Garnett said.\n\nThat said, Garnett said it\u2019s a stretch to say the solicitor general argued that the government should be able to \"force Christian schools to hire non-Christian teachers.\" He and other experts said that the question of religious institutions being able to hire people of certain religions is settled law and an issue that the government did not quarrel with.\n\n\"It\u2019s not so much that the administration would come in and say to a Christian school, \u2018You must hire a non-Christian teacher,\u2019\" Garnett said. \"It\u2019s that, if a teacher were fired by a Christian school, then that teacher\u2019s employment-discrimination lawsuit should be able to go forward as if the Christian school were any other (non-religious) association.\"\n\nRoosevelt makes an even more forceful case. Basing the ad on the argument in Hosanna-Tabor, he said, is \"totally false.\" \"That\u2019s not what the case was about, the solicitor general never suggested it, and the law clearly allows Christian schools to hire Christian teachers,\" he said.\n\nEven Laycock, who faced off against the solicitor general at the oral argument, said the ad is misconstruing the solicitor general\u2019s argument.\n\nThe solicitor general \"never implied or said that Christian schools would have to hire non-Christian teachers,\" Laycock said. \"The statute is absolutely clear that religious institutions can discriminate on the basis of religion, and of course they never questioned that. The issue was whether religion teachers could sue their churches alleging other kinds of discrimination \u2013 disability in this case. We said no, the solicitor general said sometimes yes, when the case could be decided without interfering in the church\u2019s religious mission. We didn\u2019t think that was a workable standard. The disagreement about disability discrimination would have applied to sex discrimination and age discrimination as well, but it clearly did not apply to religious discrimination -- that was common ground.\"\n\nMurray also cited an article about Chai Feldblum, a Georgetown University law professor appointed by President Obama to serve on the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, that said she has written that society should \"not tolerate\" any \"private beliefs,\"\u00a0including religious beliefs,\u00a0that may negatively affect homosexual \"equality.\" But Murray did not provide any evidence that her actions at the EEOC would force Christian schools to hire non-Christian teachers.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.
