There's no homelessness there.\"\nReally?\nThat\u2019s an exaggeration, of course. But if you crunch the numbers about Tokyo and its homeless population, you\u2019ll see Carson isn\u2019t that far off.\nHomelessness in Japan, United States\nJapan\u2019s government estimates Tokyo\u2019s homeless population is around 1,200 people, according to 2018 data. That\u2019s 0.0092 percent of the city\u2019s population or just under one homeless person for every 10,000 residents.\u00a0\nBy contrast, New York City\u2019s homeless population is around 79,000 of its 8.6 million residents, a rate of nearly 92 homeless people for every 10,000 people, which, like Tokyo, is also less than 1 percent.\nThis chart illustrates the disparity.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf Baltimore\u2019s roughly 600,000 residents, some 2,500 are homeless, which is less than 1 percent of the overall population and translates to a rate of around 42 homeless people per 10,000 residents.\nNationwide, the Japanese government said that just under 5,000 are homeless in the entire country of 126 million.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s just 0.0039 percent of the overall population. A HUD spokesman said Carson \"was talking about homelessness in Japan being functionally at zero.\"\nWhen Japan released its data last year, the government\u2019s welfare ministry said the tally represents a 15-year low. The ministry credited government programs, including counseling, for the reduction, according to The Japan Times.\u00a0\nExperts say Japan's outreach to its homeless population is among a combination of factors that explain the large disparity in homelessness rates of Japan and the United States.\u00a0\n\"The Tokyo government has made a concerted push to reduce numbers and provide shelter to more than before,\" said Jeffrey Kingston of Temple University\u2019s Japan campus. \"More counseling and outreach \u2014 as in going to places homeless people congregate and offering support and counseling \u2014 have helped reduce numbers a great deal. Efforts to win trust and provide care have helped.\"\nKingston said some Japanese homeless people, who might prefer to live on the street and are reluctant to accept aid, increasingly lean on government support as they age and health problems accumulate.\n\"They have had to stop \u2018living rough\u2019 even though many prefer this,\" said Kingston, invoking a common euphemism for Japan\u2019s homeless population.\nTokyo has acknowledged its official tally of the homeless population may be an undercount. The government reached its figure by surveying the number of people dwelling in public spaces like riverbeds and parks. The methodology has received some criticism because it likely overlooks less visible segments of the homeless population, including those engaged in the well-documented practice of taking shelter in internet cafes or saunas. (For the record: Advocates in the United States say we also likely undercount the homeless population.)\nOur ruling\nCarson said there is no homelessness in Tokyo.\nCarson would have been better saying virtually no homeless. But his overall point is correct. Tokyo\u2019s government puts the homeless population at roughly 1,200. In a city of roughly 13.5 million, that\u2019s around 0.0092 percent of the population.\u00a0\nWe rate his claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00374"}
