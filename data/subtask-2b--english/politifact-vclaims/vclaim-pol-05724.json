Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., wouldn\u2019t reveal just how high he\u2019d raise income taxes on the rich during the Iowa presidential debate, but he guaranteed it wouldn\u2019t be as much as it has been in the past.\nIn order to pay for making college tuition-free for Americans, Sanders said that Wall Street owed the middle class for bailing it out during the recent financial crisis. He said he would demand \"that the wealthiest people and the largest corporations, who have gotten away with murder for years, start paying their fair share.\"\n\"Well, let\u2019s get specific, how high would you go?\" CBS News moderator Nancy Cordes asked. \"You\u2019ve said before you\u2019d go above 50 percent. How high?\"\n\"We haven\u2019t come up with an exact number yet, but it will not be as high as the number under Dwight D. Eisenhower, which was 90 percent,\" Sanders answered.\nWas the top income tax rate under Eisenhower an astronomical 90 percent? We decided to check the ledgers on that figure.\nBefore we go further, let\u2019s review what the marginal tax rate means. It\u2019s the tax rate that\u2019s applied to the last dollar earned. The U.S. tax system is based on brackets. The top marginal tax rate applies to the highest bracket. Income is taxed at higher rates as more is earned.\nWe turned to the Tax Foundation\u2019s federal income tax rates history, which documents figures going all the way back to 1913, when the income tax began with the ratification of the 16th Amendment.\nDuring the eight years of the Eisenhower presidency, from 1953 to 1961, the top marginal rate was 91 percent. (It was 92 percent the year he came into office.)\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does it mean, though? For the duration of Eisenhower\u2019s presidency, that rate affected individuals making $200,000 or more per year or couples making $400,000 and above per year.\nIn 2015 dollars, that's roughly $1.7 million for an individual and $3.4 million for a couple.\nToday the tax brackets\u00a0are adjusted for inflation, but are exceptionally lower than in Eisenhower\u2019s day. The top rate in 2015 is 39.6 percent, applied to single people making $413,200 or more per year, or married couples filing jointly making $464,850 or more annually. If we went back to 1954, single people making the equivalent of $413,200 would be in a 72 percent tax bracket, while a couple making $464,850 would end up in a 75 percent bracket.\nWhat\u2019s the highest income tax bracket ever put in place? In 1944-45, during World War II, couples making more than $200,000 faced an all-time high of 94 percent.\nOur ruling\nSanders said income tax rates under Eisenhower were as high as 90 percent.\nA look through the records shows that top earners in the eight years of Eisenhower\u2019s presidency paid a top income tax rate of 91 percent. It was even a bit higher before he took office.\nWe rate Sanders\u2019 statement True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05724"}
