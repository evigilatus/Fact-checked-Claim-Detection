After all, \"nearly 200\" is indeed \"more than 100.\" \u00a0Moore, in an email, pointed us to virtually the same data and analysis that PolitiFact Georgia reviewed in 2011.\nBut now, that information, which is available on the Internet, includes a note about the 2011 PolitiFact ruling that faulted PETA for not saying that small sea creatures such as shellfish made up an overwhelming majority of the nearly 200 \"animals.\"\nThe calculation cited by PETA and Moore starts with the total number of animals raised in the United States or imported for American consumption, based on statistics from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration and other sources,\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen all the cows, pigs, fish, and fowl, shellfish, lobsters and other crustaceans are divided by the people in the country who eat them. The product of that calculation is the animal death toll for which PETA blames the average American meat eater.\nChris Hurt, a professor of agricultural economics at Purdue University, told PolitiFact Georgia that, although misleading, he found the statement technically accurate.\nOur ruling\nPerhaps the most misleading thing about Moore\u2019s column is that from the opening sentences onward she writes about pigs and cows and the health risks of meat eating. She doesn\u2019t touch on fish or fowl (or crustaceans) in her argument.\nShe concludes: \"Researchers have found that people who eat plant-based meals are between 25 and 50 percent less likely to get cancer, and each vegan spares more than 100 animals every year.\n\"Bacon isn't worth dying for \u2014 not for people and certainly not for pigs. With so many tasty vegan foods to enjoy, kicking the meat habit is entirely possible. And it could save your life.\"\nThere is no way a reader would know that the 100 animals she refers to are mostly animals that live underwater as opposed to the barnyard animals that she and the World Health Organization warned us not to eat. \u00a0\nThis is the point PolitiFact Georgia made four years ago as noted by her source. And although Moore referred to \"more than 100\" rather than saying \"nearly 200,\" she still fails to provide the context that\u2019s necessary to understand how the number is calculated.\nFor that reason, the Half True in 2011 becomes a Mostly False in 2015.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05652"}
