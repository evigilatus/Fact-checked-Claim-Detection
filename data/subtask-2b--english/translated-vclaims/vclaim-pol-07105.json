Shaheen, Brown said only seven minutes in the debate in Concord, \"In fact, he voted with the President over 99 percent of the time. What does that mean for people in New Hampshire? That means she was the crucial voice of Obamacker. I also voted to develop policies where we have more and more stalemate by voting with her party over 99 percent of the time.\" Brown has repeatedly made differences in this claim over the past few months so that anyone in New Hampshire has been connected to an electronic device that he has certainly heard. Brown's declarations have been the backbone of an intense air war -- so far in the United States Senate race, more than 10,000 announcements broadcast the cost, more than $7 million. ==History==Politi Fakt New Hampshire researched a copy of this allegation last March, after the Republican New Hampshire Party released an online video entitled \"99 percent.\" She claimed Shaheen consistently supported the president and voted with Obama 99% of the time. The announcement was made before Brown officially declared himself a candidate in the race. Here, we will look at Brown's claim that Shahin \"voted with the President 99% of the time.\" \u2219 (Last year, Paulette Fuckett New Hampshire verified the allegation that Shahin was the decisive vote for Chahen Carcare and ruled that he was mostly wrong.) Brown's shipment carries some weight. Although Obama won in New Hampshire twice, the majority of residents (55 per cent) now refuse to perform his job, and legislative achievement signed by him -- the expensive Care Act, or \"Obamakari\" -- is opposed by 52 per cent of the state's population, according to findings from Paul, Granite State, on 10 October 2014, conducted by the Survey Centre of the University of New Hampshire. :: Democrats throughout the country have faced similar criticism from Republicans; Polyte Fact has often examined such allegations and found them to be of varying degree of precision. Obama himself recognized this strategy during a speech at Northwestern University on 2 October 2014. \"Now, I'm not in the polls this fall,\" said Obama. \"But don't miss: these policies in the polls -- each of them.\" During the discussion, Brown even quoted the President to lead his point of view home. Of course, most politicians line up with the President when their party controls the White House. However, we decided that it would still be useful to look at Shaheen's voting record to see if Brown was right. When we investigated this claim earlier, we asked the National Public Prosecutor &apos; s Office to provide evidence. The Executive Director, Matt Moores, referred to the annual presidential voting report issued by the quarterly Congress. CQ, a news service covering Capitol Hill, examines the voting patterns of each congressman and classifies them in ways that allow comparisons. One of these methods is the annual examination of presidential support -- the number of votes by every lawman on bills in which the current President has taken a position. The CQ analysis for 2013 shows that when you look at the range of votes that Obama has taken a clear position on, a Shahin vote corresponds to the President &apos; s position of 99% of the time. Frank Ginta stated on June 13, 2012, in a statement after applying for re-election in the Office of the Foreign Minister in N.H. \"Now, in the House of Representatives, we have 40 bills on the various functions passed, almost all of which were bi-party.\" \u2022 June 22, 2012, this number still exceeds what the eye sees. In 2013, the Senate received 291 roll-call votes. CQ Obama records that he took a clear position on 108 of those votes -- about a third. The organization &apos; s political journalist, James Bendell, further analysed the figures and found that 70 of those votes included presidential nominations - to positions ranging from Foreign Minister John Kerry to a variety of federal judges. The remaining 38 relate to some kind of policy, including seven immigration policies, four firearms policies and five budget bills. The only time Shaheen voted against Obama in 2013 was on a bill containing the Internet sales tax, which Bendell reported. We have found similar figures in the Senate reports since Shahin took office, which coincided with Obama's election to the first term. CQ put her vote with Obama at least 95 percent of the time each year. In general, in the five years since Shahin took office, Shahin's votes have tended to be President 98 per cent of the time. However, it is important to note some limitations in judging Shahin &apos; s support for the President based solely on Q &apos; s analysis. The Director of Communications Shahin Shrebal Shah indicated that the senator split up with Obama on some issues that did not reach the vote; these are not reflected in the CQ register. For example, Shah noted that Shahin opposed a new round of closure of military bases, an idea put forward by the Obama administration in the budget proposals, and opposed a proposal by the President to change social security benefits. There are also other ways to measure Shaheen's tendencies to vote. The Open Conference, a non-partisan legislative constituency, found that in 2013 Shaheen voted with the majority of Democrats 93.1 per cent of the time. This is less frequent than the regular Democratic Party in the Senate, placing it in the lower half of the list. Finally, in June 2013, Shahin appeared as a party hero by the party policy centre for its work on energy efficiency legislation. Shah said: \"It is deceiving to draw conclusions about X. Shaheen's record only in view of a few votes.\" The governor, Scott Brown, said Shaheen was voting with Obama 99% of the time. Brown has reliable support for this claim -- in 2013, Shaheen took the same position as President 99 per cent of the time when Obama set out a clear position, based on an analysis by Congressional quarterly. That wasn't much different from previous years in the Senate -- in general, her votes were consistent with Obama's 98% of the time since she took office. However, CQ classifications address a small part of all the issues facing Congress. Obama took only a clear position in about one third of the Senate's votes, and in some cases that did not reach the vote, two fats split with the President. However, Brown &apos; s claim about Shahin is not far-fetched. We're mostly assessing it right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07105"}
