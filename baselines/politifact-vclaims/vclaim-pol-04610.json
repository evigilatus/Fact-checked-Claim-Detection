Bernie Sanders relished the chance to turn the word against the GOP nominee.\n\"While Donald Trump believes in huge tax breaks -- huuuuge tax breaks \u00a0-- for billionaires, he believes that states should actually have the right to lower the minimum wage below $7 and a quarter,\" Sanders said.\nTrump\u2019s stance on the federal minimum wage \u2013 it\u2019s currently $7.25 \u2013 has been a moving target, and we\u2019ve done our best to track it.\nSanders\u2019 charge lines up most closely with what Trump said during a May 8, 2016, interview on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press. Host Chuck Todd aimed to clarify Trump\u2019s views. Here\u2019s the key exchange:\nTodd: \"Should the federal government set a floor, and then you let the states --\"\nTrump: \"No, I'd rather have the states go out and do what they have to do. And the states compete with each other, not only other countries, but they compete with each other, Chuck. So I like the idea of let the states decide. But I think people should get more. I think they're out there. They're working. It is a very low number. You know, with what's happened to the economy, with what's happened to the cost. I mean, it's just -- I don't know how you live on $7.25 an hour. But I would say let the states decide.\"\nSo while Trump voiced sympathy for low-wage workers, he rejected the idea that Washington should set a minimum and carried it further to say that states should use the wage \"to compete with each other.\"\nIf Trump had expressed that policy consistently, there would be no debate on his views. But here are other excerpts from Trump on the minimum wage:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 In an interview with MSNBC in August 2015, Trump said, \"Having a low minimum wage is not a bad thing for this country.\"\n\u2022 During the Republican debate in Milwaukee in November 2015, Trump said wages are \"too high\" and, when asked whether he would raise the minimum wage, said, \"I would not do it.\"\n\u2022 On ABC\u2019s This Week on May 8, 2016, host George Stephanopoulos asked Trump, \"Minimum wage -- all through the primaries, you were against an increase. Now you're saying you're looking at it. So what's your bottom line on this?\" Trump responded, \"Well, I am looking at it and I haven't decided in terms of numbers. But I think people have to get more.\" When Stephanopoulos asked whether that\u2019s a change, Trump answered, \"Well, sure it's a change. I'm allowed to change. You need flexibility.\"\nLooking at all his statements, we see that most of the time Trump says that he would like to see people earning more than the current minimum wage. But on the separate issue of whether Washington should mandate a hike, he is at best ambivalent, and more often than not, he opposes that.\nOur ruling\nSanders said that Trump believes that states should have the right to lower the minimum wage. Looking strictly at Trump\u2019s words, at one point, in that Meet the Press interview, he said states should have the right to set their own minimum wage and rejected the idea that the federal government should set it for the country.\nThe only quibble with Sanders\u2019 statement is he talked about what Trump believes, as if Trump\u2019s policy is fixed and steady. It isn\u2019t that simple. Trump suggested in one interview that he might consider raising the federal minimum wage. But most of the time, he has not expressed that view. Nor has Trump said anything recently to clarify his position.\nTaking Trump\u2019s ambiguity into account, we rate this claim Mostly True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2d3f300b-aebb-4aae-b6a1-8a33626d6a60", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04610"}
