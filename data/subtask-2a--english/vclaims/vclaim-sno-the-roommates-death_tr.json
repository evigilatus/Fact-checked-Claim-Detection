One of the girls went out on a date that evening, and the other went back to bed before her roommate returned. Later that night, the sleeping girl wakes up by clicking and scratching noise coming from outside the entrance door. She's scared, she locks the door and worries inside the room until morning. When the girl opens the door and ventures out, she discovers the body of her roommate in the lobby. The murdered girl's neck was slit, and he bled to death in the hallway while she was slicing the door."}
