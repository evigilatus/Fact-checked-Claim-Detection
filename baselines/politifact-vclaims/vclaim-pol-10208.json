We confer more PhDs each year than any other university in America except\" the University of California, Berkeley, he said.\n\nNearly No. 1 every year?\n\nUT spokesman Gary Susswein and Allison Danforth, a campus expert on reporting and analysis, told us UT-Austin\u2019s conferral of 857 doctoral degrees in 2009-10 placed it second nationally to Berkeley, which bestowed 891. Susswein pointed out the counts are available to the public on a website at the National Center for Education Statistics, based on information collected from institutions by the U.S. Department of Education.\n\nSusswein said that for its count, the university did not fold in degrees in law and medicine.\n\n\"The reason is very simple,\" Susswein said in a voice-mail message. \"There is no way to do an apples-to-apples comparison. We don\u2019t have a medical school\" at UT-Austin. And, he said, Texas A&M University \"doesn\u2019t have a law school. Texas A&M has a veterinary school. The University of Illinois has a medical school and a law school.\n\n\"Within the realm of PhDs,\" Susswein said, \"we\u2019ve all got liberal arts colleges, we\u2019ve all got engineering schools, we\u2019ve all got science schools. So, it\u2019s a more appropriate way to do an apples-to-apples comparison.\"\n\nMinnesota-based Capella University, which provides online offerings, placed third, awarding 841 doctorates, the tabulation indicates. Traditional universities rounded out the top 10: the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor; University of Florida; University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; the main campus of Ohio State University; University of California-Los Angeles; University of Wisconsin-Madison; and Stanford University, where 703 doctorates were awarded.\n\nSusswein said, too, that two days before Powers gave his speech, the national center posted information reflecting the results in 2010-11. UT-Austin bestowed 801 PhDs that year, placing third nationally behind Berkeley (920) and Capella (819).\n\nSo, UT was second to Berkeley one year and third the year after.\n\nAnd how about \"each\" year, as Powers said?\n\nAt our request, UT followed up by checking the database for the PhDs given out by each institution each year starting in 2003-04 through 2008-09, the year before the one initially stressed by UT.\n\nOver the six earlier years, Berkeley ranked first or second nationally in PhDs granted. In 2005-06, UT-Austin placed first nationally, besting Berkeley.\n\nIn each of the other years, UT\u2019s count placed it third to sixth nationally in PhDs awarded.\n\nFor outside perspective, we reached Michael McLendon, a Southern Methodist University professor expert on higher education. McLendon said it\u2019s not out of line for any university to compare its total PhDs granted to those given out by other institutions. He said, too, he was unaware of another measure that would give a meaninful glimpse into the productivity of universities at that level.\n\nMcLendon said a mission of the nation\u2019s public research universities is to create the next generation of scientists, scholars and researchers.The volume of students who achieve PhDs, he said, is an important indicator. UT-Austin, he said, \"looks very good.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nPowers said that each year, UT-Austin confer more PhDs than any other U.S. university except Berkeley.\n\nThat was so in 2009-10 -- and in another recent year, UT awarded even more PhDs than Berkeley.\n\nIn other years, however, UT ranked third, fourth, sixth, third and fourth nationally in PhDs bestowed as Berkeley ranked first or second. In the end, this speech claim misrepresents the results for each year by cherry-picking how the two public universities finished in one year, and those results were (narrowly) not even the latest available count.\n\nUT annually awards many PhDs. But each year of late, its total PhDs awarded has gone up and down compared to outcomes at Berkeley and a few other institutions.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPut another way, UT fell short of this proclaimed finish in six out of eight recent years.
