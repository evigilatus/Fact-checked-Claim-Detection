I think, I think it\u2019s important that they have a good image, they need a terrific image, so people will see they can believe me. I\u2019m not saying any names, but you look at those people, and they are not that nice, not nice to look at, not at all. I think Amy is much, much better looking than the women we have had. I think people know this, they know. If people are more attractive, they get a fantastic amount of respect, and we need to have that now.

He didn\u2019t discuss her looks.\u00a0\nThe next day, he fielded questions from reporters during a press briefing.
