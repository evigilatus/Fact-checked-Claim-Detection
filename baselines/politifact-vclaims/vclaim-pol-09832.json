Scott Walker says big retailer Kohl's announced 3,000 jobs", "text": "In his \"state of the state\" speech on Jan. 15, 2013, Gov. Scott Walker said Wisconsin is improving as a place for doing business, then boasted of a job-creation coup.\n\n\"Employers feel good about our state,\" the Republican governor said, reflecting on the first half of his four-year term. \"During the past year, Kohl\u2019s Department Stores worked with us and announced the creation of 3,000 new jobs.\"\n\nIn a state with unemployment well above 6 percent, having 3,000 jobs set to come online would be huge news. But that\u2019s not the headline we remember.\n\nIndeed, no ground has yet been broken on a second corporate headquarters for Kohl\u2019s that was announced in 2012, although planning is well under way.\n\nWhen it comes to employment, there are jobs and even promised jobs. Then there are potential jobs.\n\nSaying Kohl\u2019s \"announced the creation of 3,000 new jobs\" is different than saying Kohl expects or hopes to hire that many people.\n\nWhere does this one stand?\n\nGrowth of Kohl\u2019s\n\nThe first Kohl\u2019s department store opened in 1962 next to a Kohl\u2019s grocery store in the Milwaukee suburb of Brookfield. Both the department store chain and the now-defunct grocery chain were started by Max Kohl, the father of Herb Kohl, who served for 24 years as a U.S. senator from Wisconsin before deciding not to seek re-election in 2012.\n\nKohl\u2019s is now a chain of more than 1,100 family-oriented department stores in 49 states, selling Jennifer Lopez, Princess Vera Wang and other lines of clothing, as well as a variety of home goods and other items. With $18.8 billion in sales in 2011, the publicly traded company -- which is no longer connected with the Kohl family -- ranked 20th on the National Retail Federation\u2019s 2012 list of the nation\u2019s top 100 retailers.\n\nIn December 2011, news surfaced that Menomonee Falls-based Kohl\u2019s, which has 4,900 corporate employees in the Milwaukee area, might be close to announcing a decision on where to build a second headquarters building.\n\nMilwaukee was competing with Menomonee Falls, its suburban neighbor, for the $250 million corporate expansion. Three months later, Kohl\u2019s said it had decided against downtown Milwaukee and in July 2012, the company announced its chosen site in Menomonee Falls.\n\nWalker\u2019s evidence\n\nWhen we asked Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie for evidence to support Walker's claim, he provided us a news article and a news release from the governor.\n\nLike a number of other news articles during the year, the four-paragraph November 2012 news item in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel said the new headquarters was expected to create 3,000 jobs over 12 years.\n\nThe Walker news release was issued on the day Kohl's announced the Menomonee Falls site. Walker said in the release that Kohl's would receive up to $62.5 million in state tax credits over 12 years, but the actual amount \"will be completely dependent upon the number of newly created jobs and the amount of Kohl\u2019s capital expenditure.\"\n\nThe state Economic Development Corp. said that under the deal, Kohl\u2019s must retain 4,500 jobs, create 3,000 jobs and invest $250 million in new and existing facilities to get the full amount of the tax credits.\n\nSo, even news releases from Walker\u2019s office and one of his state agencies talk about the possibility of 3,000 jobs, not a certainty that they had been or would soon be created.\n\nIndeed, in a Milwaukee Business Journal article published the same day as Walker\u2019s news release, Kohl\u2019s chairman and chief executive officer Kevin Mansell said \"up to 3,000 jobs could be added\" over 12 years.\n\nThat\u2019s a projection that, even if well founded, doesn\u2019t amount to a commitment to create that many jobs. And there\u2019s no way to know whether economic conditions over 12 years will enable Kohl\u2019s to reach its hiring goal.\n\nOur rating\n\nWalker said that in 2012, Kohl\u2019s Department Stores \"announced the creation of 3,000 new jobs.\"\n\nWhat Kohl\u2019s announced is it would build a new headquarters and expected to create 3,000 jobs, over 12 years -- not that 3,000 jobs were a certainty.\n\nFor being partially accurate but leaving out important details, we rate Walker\u2019s statement Half True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09832"}
