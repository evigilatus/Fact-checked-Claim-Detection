Oh, they happen to have the name Trump on them. Isn't that shocking?\" Trump said Oct. 20. \"How about the ones that were printed without my name on it, right? They had everything on it. They had every race, they had everything. You had the Senate, you had everything, they forgot to put me down.\"\nWe contacted the Trump campaign about ballots without his name and did not get a response. It\u2019s possible that Trump was referring to faulty ballots in one precinct in Los Angeles, which he talked about on Twitter and in an Oct. 8 interview on Fox News.\nBallots omitted presidential race in one LA precinct\nOn Oct. 5, Los Angeles elections officials learned that a small percentage of mail ballots omitted the presidential race entirely. That meant that it wasn\u2019t only Trump\u2019s name that was missing, but also Democratic nominee Joe Biden.\nThe faulty ballots were mailed to a single precinct of just over 2,100 voters out of a total of more than 5.6 million registered voters in the county, according to an Oct. 5 statement by the Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk. The affected voters in Woodland Hills were contacted via roboball and email and the county sent them new ballots.\nAs of Oct. 21, there were no additional reports of ballots elsewhere omitting the presidential race, Mike Sanchez, a spokesperson for the elections office, told us. His office attributed the faulty ballots to a printing error.\nThe voters who were sent a corrected ballot will only be allowed to vote once. The return envelopes have a bar code with the identification for each voter so that election officials can log in that the person cast a ballot, preventing a second ballot from the same voter being counted.\n400 Michigan ballots omitted Pence\u2019s name\nOn Sept. 17,\u00a0 Trump tweeted about another ballot screw up, that time in Michigan. The ballot omitted Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s name and made it appear as if Trump was running with Jeremy Cohen, who is a Libertarian candidate.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.

The error happened when clerks were downloading the ballots for military and overseas voters. Wimmer told PolitiFact that the problem was resolved within a few hours.\u00a0\n\"The misprint was the result of an isolated human error, and it would not happen again,\" Wimmer told PolitiFact. \"We do not know how many of these ballots were sent to voters, but clerks were instructed to immediately alert voters of the error and send a corrected ballot. Voters who use the incorrect ballot instead of corrected ballots will still have their vote counted.\"\nAs of Oct. 19, of the nearly 3 million ballots requested in Michigan, 1.5 million have already been returned.\nIn his Erie rally, Trump also commented about ballots thrown in the trash. A New Jersey mail carrier was charged by federal prosecutors who said he discarded 1,875 pieces of mail including 99 ballots.\u00a0\nIn Luzerne County, Pa., news reports stated that an election worker discarded nine military ballots in September. Election officials said that sometimes military ballots arrive inside envelopes that do not clearly mark them as ballots, and there was confusion. Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar said it was an error.\u00a0\nRELATED: Trump whiffs describing Wisconsin ballot case\nOur ruling\u00a0\nTrump said \"phony\" ballots \"were printed without my name on it.\"\nWe found an instance of about 2,000 ballots sent to a single precinct in Los Angeles that skipped the presidential race entirely \u2014 not just his name, but Biden\u2019s and the other candidates, too. The county quickly replaced those faulty ballots.\u00a0\nErrors are not evidence of a conspiracy to favor one candidate or commit fraud.
