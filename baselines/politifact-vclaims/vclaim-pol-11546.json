Chris Christie considers \"shameful.\"\n\nAs the governor announced more funding for social services in his budget speech on Feb. 21, he told the Legislature the government needs to change that fact by providing better care to the state\u2019s vulnerable residents.\n\n\"New Jersey has the second highest rate of institutionalization in America. Only Texas puts more of its citizens -- confines more of its citizens -- to institutions than New Jersey. This is a shameful fact. We must change. It\u2019s long overdue,\" he said.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Christie made this point.\n\nDuring an \"Ask the Governor\" segment in January on New Jersey 101.5 FM, Christie said: \"one of the sins in New Jersey is that we have more developmentally disabled folks institutionalized in New Jersey than any state other than Texas. And it's just obscene.\"\n\nChristie is on the mark by the number of people with developmental disabilities in large, state-operated institutions. But when measured as a rate of the general population, his comment needs some clarification.\n\nMichael Drewniak, the governor\u2019s spokesman, cited a report from the State of the States in Developmental Disabilities, a project administered by the University of Colorado. The group tracks state-level data on revenue, spending, and programmatic trends for services for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Several experts said the group\u2019s report is their primary source for data.\n\nThe report includes two measures of institutionalization: raw numbers and rates. The rates are calculated per 100,000 people in the general population.\n\nExperts told us both measures matter. But, they said, comparing rates, rather than raw numbers, accounts for the likelihood that more populous states institutionalize more people.\n\nDrewniak said Christie\u2019s statement was based on the State of the States in Developmental Disabilities report from 2008, but acknowledged more recent figures have become available.\n\n\"The 2008 information (and New Jersey\u2019s rank vis-a-vis Texas) has apparently been established in the policy lexicon/discussion here in New Jersey and, thus, has been referred to on several occasions by the Governor, including [on Feb. 21] in the budget speech. \u00a0Regardless, the data from 2011, shows NJ is still 49th in the nation,\" Drewniak said in an e-mail.\n\nIn the most recent report, New Jersey had 2,703 people living in state-operated institutions of 16 or more people. Only Texas had more people living in such institutions, at 4,899 people.\n\nSharon Lewis, commissioner of the Administration on Developmental Disabilities, a branch of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said different groups may define institution in various ways. But state-operated facilities with 16 or more people is one definition.\n\nThe State of the States in Developmental Disabilities ranks states and Washington, D.C. by the number of developmentally disabled people in large, state-operated institutions as a rate per 100,000 of the state\u2019s general population.\n\nBy that measure, New Jersey ranks 49th, followed by Arkansas and Mississippi. Texas ranks 43rd.\n\nState advocates for the developmentally disabled said by either measure New Jersey isn\u2019t doing well.\n\n\"We are very much behind the rest of the country in getting people out into to the community,\" said Alison \u00a0M. Lozano, executive director of the New Jersey Council on Developmental Disabilities. \"I think it\u2019s a poor reflection on how we provide services in this state, unfortunately.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nChristie said: \"New Jersey has the second highest rate of institutionalization in America. Only Texas puts more of its citizens -- confines more of its citizens -- to institutions than New Jersey.\"\n\nChristie is right, according to the population of large, state-operated institutions. Only Texas has more people with developmental disabilities in such institutions than New Jersey.\n\nHowever, as a rate compared to the general population, the governor is slightly off. Arkansas and Mississippi institutionalize more people with developmental disabilities than New Jersey by that measure. Texas is 43rd.\n\nStill, experts agree that the governor\u2019s point is on target: New Jersey lags the rest of the country in moving people with developmental disabilities out of institutions and into the community.\n\nWe rate the statement Mostly True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11546"}
