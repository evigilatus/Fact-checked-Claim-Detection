Pat Toomey battles for re-election in one of the most important senate races in the nation, it\u2019s been his record on guns that\u2019s drawn some of the most attention.\nIt\u2019s apparently part of why former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg endorsed Toomey, and Bloomberg\u2019s political action committee is now running ads in support of Toomey that tout his efforts to \"put our safety ahead of partisan politics.\"\nThe Independence USA PAC bankrolled an ad running in Pennsylvania\u00a0that claims \"Toomey crossed party lines twice: first to support background checks, and now to stop gun sales to suspects on the terror watch list.\"\nWe\u2019ve written before about Toomey signing on\u00a0in 2013 and putting his name on a bill that would have expanded background checks. But what about his efforts to stop gun sales to suspects on the terror watch list?\nToomey\u2019s record there is a bit murkier.\nTo be clear: A bill that would stop gun sales to suspects on any sort of terror watch list has not passed. Efforts were made after the June shooting in Orlando at Pulse Nightclub, the deadliest mass shooting in American history, which left 49 people and the shooter dead. But those efforts were fruitless.\nThere were several major bills drafted in the wake of Orlando that would have closed what\u2019s been called \"the terror loophole,\" or would make it harder for suspected terrorists on the federal government\u2019s radar to buy guns. Two such bills -- both with largely partisan backing -- were brought up for a vote on June 20 and both were defeated.\nProponents of a ban on gun sales to those on a terror watch list say individuals who are suspected terrorists appear on a no-fly list, but are still allowed to purchase guns. Opponents worry individuals who accidentally end up on the no-fly list would be stripped of their second amendment rights.\nThe Democrats\u2019 bill was a plan by Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, and her bill would have placed a blanket ban on the purchase of guns by those on the no-fly list, as it was dubbed \"no-fly, no buy.\" Some Republicans argued her bill didn\u2019t give an out to people who may have ended up on the watch list mistakenly.\nTwo Republicans voted in favor of Feinstein\u2019s bill. Toomey wasn\u2019t one of them, saying the bill didn\u2019t include enough due process for potential gun owners.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPat Toomey\n\n\nstated on January 19, 2021 in a hearing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere will be several thousand dollars in payments going to families with six-figure incomes who\u2019ve had no income interruption whatsoever.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jessica Calefati \u2022 January 21, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe majority of Republicans supported a bill from Sen. John Cornyn, of Texas. His measure, which was backed by the National Rifle Association, would have placed a three-day hold when anyone on the terror watch list attempted to purchase a gun. Within those three days, the government would have to present a case before a court in order to stop the person from buying the firearm.\nThough\u00a0Toomey said in June\u00a0that it would be hard for law enforcement to make Cornyn\u2019s measure \"workable,\" he voted in favor of it in the end.\nToomey also drafted his own bill to close the terror loophole, which he touted as a measure that would bridge the gap between the Feinstein and the Cornyn amendments. Under Toomey\u2019s plan, the U.S. attorney general would generate a list of \"likely terrorists\" separate from the existing no-fly list. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court would review the list, and the attorney general would have the power to block the purchase of a gun by an individual on that list.\nBut Toomey\u2019s bill largely flopped. Though he was reportedly in talks with gun control group Everytown for Gun Safety, the group ultimately didn\u2019t endorse his proposal. Republican leaders didn\u2019t put it up for a vote, and Democrats largely opposed it.\nWhen\u00a0PolitiFact\u00a0reached out to Toomey\u2019s campaign to inquire about his record when it comes to closing the terror loophole, his campaign pointed out that Toomey was one of eight Republicans to support an amendment from Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, that would have given the Justice Department the ability to deny gun sales to individuals on two terror-related lists -- and it had an appeal process.\nThat bill, which Toomey spoke on the Senate floor in favor of, had bipartisan support and survived a \"test vote\" several days after the Feinstein and Cornyn amendments failed. That showed that the bill had significant support, but not the 60 votes it would need to advance -- meaning GOP leaders probably won\u2019t bring it up for a full vote any time soon.\nIndependence USA, which is running the ads in Pennsylvania, didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nOur Ruling\nIn an ad running in Pennsylvania, the Independence USA PAC backed by Mayor Michael Bloomberg claimed \"Toomey crossed party lines\u2026 to stop gun sales to suspects on the terror watch list.\"\nThis ad is misleading at its core, largely because a measure to stop gun sales to suspects on the terror watch list never passed. Toomey\u2019s own bill failed to garner significant support from either side of the aisle. Though he voted for the Collins amendment which had bipartisan support, that amendment was drafted by a Republican.\nIn the end, Toomey voted with his party when he voted against Feinstein\u2019s bill and in favor of Cornyn\u2019s.
