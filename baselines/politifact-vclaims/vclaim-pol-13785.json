Davis\u2019 comments struck us immediately as a misrepresentation.\n\nThe health care law does include a mandate for Americans to have insurance. But it\u2019s not a mandate that applies whether people can \"afford it or not.\"\n\nHere\u2019s how it works: The mandate is a tax penalty assessed on people\u2019s income tax returns. The tax won\u2019t affect anyone who has health insurance. The uninsured, though, will be penalized if they remain uninsured. Supporters of Obama\u2019s health law say the penalty is intended to prod them to get health insurance, not punish them.\n\nThe law has provisions so that people with lower incomes can afford coverage. The law expands Medicaid, an existing government health insurance program for the very poor. And it gives tax credits to people of modest means to help them buy their own insurance policies.\n\nPeople who earn less than 400 percent of the poverty level are eligible for tax credits that go to help them buy their own insurance. That works out to $44,680 for a single person or $92,200 for a family of four. Those income levels strike us as middle class.\n\nContrary to the impression Davis gave, the law does make exceptions if people can\u2019t afford insurance.\n\nIf people have to pay more than 8 percent of their earnings for a health insurance policy (not counting their employers\u2019 contributions or the new tax credits), they qualify for a hardship exemption. That means they would still be uninsured, but the mandate would not apply to them.\n\nAlso, people are exempt from the mandate if they don\u2019t make enough money to have to file a federal tax return. There are also exemptions for illegal immigrants, prisoners, and people who have religious objections to health insurance.\n\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan health care research group, explains via a graphic how the mandate functions.\n\nWe should note that there are two tricky aspects to Davis\u2019 claim.\n\nHe says the \"middle class\" would have to buy insurance whether they could afford it or not. There is no standard definition of the middle class. Certainly many people who don\u2019t qualify for assistance under the health care law would consider themselves middle class. And some of these same people might say that they can\u2019t afford to spend 8 percent of their income on health insurance.\n\nStill, Davis\u2019 remarks at the Republican National Convention make it sound like the law is indifferent to issues of affordability. That\u2019s hardly the case. People earning less than 400 percent of the federal poverty level would qualify for tax credits to purchase insurance. And if a health insurance policy exceeded 8 percent of income, people would qualify for a hardship exemption under the law. We rate Davis\u2019 claim Mostly False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H.
