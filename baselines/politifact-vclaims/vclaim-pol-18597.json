TRUMP has rescued over 300 missing children from pedifiles and perverts. Pick your President,\" one Sept. 16 Facebook post reads. (It misspelled \"pedophiles.\")\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe post, which has echoes of a widely debunked conspiracy theory known as QAnon, paints a distorted picture of both Biden, now the Democratic presidential nominee, and the president he is seeking to unseat on Nov. 3.\nThe bathroom issue\nThe claims that President Barack Obama and Vice President Biden \u2014 now the Democratic presidential nominee \u2014 allowed grown men into restrooms with young girls appears to stem from an accusation Republican Sen. Ted Cruz made after the Obama administration issued guidance to schools about civil rights protections for transgender students.\nA May 2016 letter to schools from the Justice and Education departments said that schools were not allowed to force students to use facilities that aligned with their sex assigned at birth:\n\"A school may provide separate facilities on the basis of sex, but must allow transgender students access to such facilities consistent with their gender identity. A school may not require transgender students to use facilities inconsistent with their gender identity or to use individual-user facilities when other students are not required to do so.\"\nThe requirement prompted a lawsuit, and the debate about which bathrooms transgender individuals should be allowed to use emerged as a talking point during the 2016 presidential campaign.\nCruz, a Republican who ran against Trump for the presidential nomination in 2016, claimed the Obama-era rule required schools to \"allow grown men and boys into little girls\u2019 bathrooms.\" We rated Cruz\u2019s claim Mostly False as the guidance was related to students, not adults.\nOnce in office, Trump\u2019s administration rescinded the guidance, saying the issue was best resolved \"at the state and local level.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 30, 2021 in a blog post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cTrump assassination foiled, Deep State in panic mode!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 February 4, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiden has pledged to reinstate the guidance if elected.\nNevertheless, the Obama-era rule that required schools to allow students to use the bathroom that corresponded with their gender identity applied to students. But the guidance said nothing about adult men, as the post claims.\nRescuing children\nThere is no evidence that Trump has \"rescued over 300 missing children from pedifiles and perverts.\" The claim is associated with QAnon, a widely discredited and baseless conspiracy theory that maintains leading Democrats and other public figures are Satan-worshiping pedophiles and that Trump is secretly working to stop them.\nWe looked into a similar social media claim that Trump created a \"child protective force that found over 300 missing kids in less than 30 days,\" and rated it False.\nThe U.S. Marshals service\u2019s Missing Child Unit, working alongside local agencies, has safely located or recovered missing children for years, including while Trump was president. But many of the children were found where they belonged, and weren\u2019t \"rescued\" from anyone, as the post claims.\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post claims, \"Biden and Obama allowed grown men in restrooms with little girls. TRUMP has rescued over 300 missing children from pedifiles and perverts.\"\nObama administration guidance required schools to allow transgender students to use the bathroom that corresponded with their gender identity, but the rule said nothing about allowing adults to do so as well.\u00a0\nDuring the Trump presidency, the U.S. Marshals Missing Child Unit has conducted operations to locate missing children. But there is no evidence to suggest Trump \"rescued\" 300 children from perverts.\nWe rate this post False.\n\u00a0\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections FactChat #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click\u00a0here, for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18597"}
