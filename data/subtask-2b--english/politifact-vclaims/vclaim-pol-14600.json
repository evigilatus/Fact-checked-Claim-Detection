Several news articles have been written on Gilbert\u2019s legal history, and the Staples campaign has aired them on its \"Guilty Guilty Gilbert\" website.\n\nGenerally, the campaigns have sniped so much that the Houston Chronicle has called the race a \"snarling, gouging, roll-in-the-dirt rhetorical grudge match,\" a reference to their 2006 faceoff when Staples beat Gilbert to win his office.\n\nNovel or not, the Staples campaign (through a surrogate) lobs six (count \u2018em) charges. Do they stick?\n\nLet\u2019s start with the criminal conviction. In January 2001, according to a Smith County court document, Gilbert, who lives near the East Texas burg of Whitehouse, pleaded guilty to a Class C misdemeanor theft charge, paying a $100 fine plus court costs.\n\nEarlier this year, the American-Statesman quoted as Gilbert saying the arrest originated in miscommunication between accountants for a cleaning service he and his wife own. That miscommunication, Gilbert said, led to three months\u2019 worth of payroll taxes going unpaid. The snafu, Gilbert said, also resulted in a $100 check that he thinks was written to Lowe\u2019s, the home improvement store, initially going unpaid. The check touched off the theft charge, according to Gilbert.\n\nVince Leibowitz, Gilbert\u2019s campaign manager, objected to calling the misdemeanor conviction \"theft,\" saying it was \"theft by check.\" He shared a copy of what he said was Gilbert\u2019s plea agreement; it says he was charged with \"theft by check,\" a Class B misdemeanor. A judgment signed by a county court-at-law judge says Gilbert pleaded guilty to the \"lesser included offense of Theft C.\"\n\nWe contacted the Smith County district attorney\u2019s office where Leslie McLean, an assistant district attorney, confirmed that Gilbert was originally charged with Class B \"theft by check.\"\n\nOn a related front, McLean said Gilbert\u2019s case stemmed from a $149.39 check paid to a local resident \u2014 information a bit different from what Gilbert said earlier this year.\n\nAs to unpaid taxes, the Statesman quoted Gilbert as saying he and his wife had 18 months remaining on an IRS repayment plan. According to the newspaper\u2019s report, Gilbert had to pay back not only missed tax payments, but also two years\u2019 worth of penalties and interest to cover for the period he did not know their business had missed his payments.\n\n\"Small businesses go through this kind of thing every day,\" Gilbert told the Statesman. \"Unfortunately a lot of them choose the easy way out and stiff whoever they owe and never pay them. That\u2019s not the kind of people we are.\"\n\nSmith County records posted by Staples\u2019 campaign indicate that Gilbert faced tax liens for unpaid taxes in 1995, 2000, 2001 and 2002. All told, the records indicate, he accumulated $77,126 in taxes and penalties. Leibowitz told us Gilbert is repaying everything.\n\nAnd Gilbert\u2019s driving record? A Smith County document posted by Staples\u2019 campaign indicates Gilbert got a ticket for driving with an expired driver\u2019s license in April 2008 for which he paid a $134.50 fine plus court costs in January 2010. That month, his campaign told the Dallas Morning News that Gilbert dealt with the ticket after aides noticed he was driving with the expired license. The newspaper said he\u2019d gotten the ticket for the expired license when he got a speeding ticket in 2008.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 23, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBiden invested the entire family fortune in Ukraine gas and oil. Then shuts down Keystone pipeline. Starting to get the picture.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother Smith County document says Gilbert was ticketed in March 2005 for driving without a seat belt, later paying a $53 fine plus court costs. \"I never wear one,\" Gilbert was quoted in the Morning News this January. \"I just plug them in to keep them from dinging.\"\n\nLinda Culp, chief clerk of the county\u2019s Precinct 3 Justice of the Peace court, checked county records and found that in addition to what the Staples campaign highlighted, Gilbert paid fines for tickets he got in 1997-98 for speeding, not wearing a seat belt and not having auto insurance.\n\nIn Gilbert\u2019s defense, Leibowitz said: \"When you look at driving without a seat belt, that is not necessarily unsafe to other passengers on the road. That is unsafe to you.\" The campaign manager said Gilbert does use his seat belt, contrary to what the candidate told the Dallas newspaper.\n\nLet\u2019s pull over and assess the first four charges in Eppstein\u2019s statement.\n\nCriminal conviction for theft? Actually, Gilbert was charged with the Class B misdemeanor of \"theft by check\" and pleaded guilty to a lesser, Class C charge, according to the court documents provided by his campaign.\n\nMultiple years of unpaid taxes? Yes (though Gilbert\u2019s said he\u2019s paying them back).\n\nMultiple tax liens and fines? Yes, yet note the repayment declaration.\n\nUnsafe driving convictions? Gilbert acknowledges tickets he\u2019s paid, including for speeding and not wearing his seat belt. Smith County says he previously paid for tickets on other violations.\n\nNext, let\u2019s tackle the rest of Eppstein\u2019s sally \u2014 that Gilbert has recently been accused of taking a bribe and is on record lying to the press about his criminal record.\n\nKinky Friedman, Gilbert\u2019s opponent for the Democratic nomination for agriculture commissioner, raised his eyebrows in January at the revelation in campaign contribution and expenditure reports that Gilbert fielded $150,000 in donations from Farouk Shami, a Democratic gubernatorial candidate, in late 2009 after Gilbert left the governor\u2019s race to run for ag commissioner.\n\nFriedman called the donations a bribe. Gilbert\u2019s campaign replied there was no payoff. Shami said likewise. And that\u2019s where everyone left it, far as we can tell.\n\nEppstein\u2019s last punch \u2014 that Gilbert is on record lying to the press this year about his criminal record \u2014 refers to Gilbert\u2019s responses on a questionnaire from the Dallas Morning News. Staples\u2019 website says the question was: \"Have you ever been arrested?\"\n\nGilbert answered that he was arrested for an \"unpaid traffic ticket,\" according to an excerpt from the questionnaire posted by Staples\u2019 campaign. Eppstein, objecting, said Gilbert omitted his 2001 conviction. However, Leibowitz told us, the Democrat was never arrested on that charge, a point confirmed by Laurita Vodak, court coordinator for Smith County Court-at-Law No. 3.\n\nHow do the last two claims by Eppstein rate? Well, Gilbert was accused of taking a bribe, but that charge came from a political opponent, hardly an impartial force.\n\nStaples\u2019 last claim \u2014 that Gilbert lied by not including his theft conviction in answering the question about arrests \u2014 is flawed. Gilbert wasn\u2019t arrested on the charge, though he certainly faced justice and could have mentioned the conviction on the questionnaire.\n\nAll in all, we rate the Staples campaign\u2019s statement Half True.\n\nFootnote: We\u2019d be happy not to sort multi-part charges again. That OK with everyone?", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-14600"}
