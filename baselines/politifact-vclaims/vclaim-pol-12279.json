Anybody?\"\n\nCain\u2019s plan seems to have struck a chord with some voters because it appears easy to understand, particularly compared with the current tax code and its mish-mash of different rates, deductions, credits and loopholes.\n\nBut would voters be better off? The day after the debate, Cain was grilled by NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd, who wanted to know how the plan would affect working people. Todd quoted an analysis by economist Bruce Bartlett that said, \"At a minimum, the Cain plan is a distributional monstrosity. The poor would pay more while the rich would have their taxes cut.\"\n\n\"First of all, the fact that I got attacked so much and my plan got attacked so much last night, that's a good thing,\" Cain said. \"Because it gives me an opportunity to correct some of those misperceptions.\n\n\"For example, here's what a lot of people missed, including Bruce Bartlett. ...Start with the 9-9-9 and the fact that every worker pays 15.3 percent payroll tax. Now they're going to pay 9 percent, okay? That's a 6 percentage point difference. The 9-9-9 plan replaces payroll tax, capital gains tax, corporate income tax, personal income tax and the death tax. So, five taxes we replace with those three. We start with throwing out the current tax code.\"\n\nCain is suggesting that the new national sales tax would be a smaller percentage than today\u2019s payroll taxes. But the 15.3-percent number he mentioned didn\u2019t sound quite right to us, so we decided to check it out.\n\nWhat we found is that Cain is counting both worker and employer contributions to payroll taxes to arrive at the 15.3 percent number.\n\nFirst, here\u2019s a quick primer on how payroll taxes work: If you work for an employer, the employer deducts payroll taxes before you get your paycheck and then sends the money on to the federal government. The taxes pay for Social Security and Medicare; it's listed as FICA on your pay stub. Typically, workers pay 6.2 percent of their first $106,800 in earnings for Social Security taxes, and they pay 1.45 percent on all their earnings for Medicare hospital coverage. That\u2019s a total of 7.65 percent in payroll taxes for workers making less than $106,800.\n\nBut the employer also has to match those taxes, bringing total contributions on behalf of an individual to 12.4 percent for Social Security and 2.9 percent for Medicare. That means total payroll taxes for each worker reach 15.3 percent, the number Cain mentioned.\n\nSo most workers see only about half the amount Cain mentioned deducted from their paychecks.\n\n(And for every tax rule now in place, it seems like there are exceptions. The exception in this case is on the self-employed. They are required to pay the worker\u2019s share of payroll taxes and the employer share. So that group would be paying the 15.3 percent Cain mentioned.)\n\nAlso in Cain\u2019s defense, many economists believe that if the government were to end payroll taxes, it would mean higher pay for workers -- maybe not immediately, but at least over the long run, because it\u2019s part of the cost of labor. \u00a0\n\nStill, there\u2019s no rule or law that would require employers to give workers a raise equal to the employer's share of payroll taxes previously paid to the government. The taxes paid now are not considered part of workers\u2019 wages in any formal or legal sense.\n\nWe have to add one other note of explanation that\u2019s particular to the current economic downturn. In 2010, President Barack Obama and Congress knocked 2 percentage points off Social Security taxes for workers, as an economic stimulus measure. So this year, most workers are paying 4.2 percent while employers pay 6.2 percent. That means the current overall number isn\u2019t 15.3 percent, but 13.3 percent.\n\nOne final note on the 9-9-9 plan itself: In our review of the commentary on Cain\u2019s tax plan, we saw that economic analysts have said the Cain campaign needs to release more detailed information on the plan so that it can be properly modeled, to find out how much revenue it would generate and how it would affect taxpayers of different income levels. Cain said in the interview with Todd that he intended to release more information on the plan soon.\n\nOur ruling\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

Workers only pay half that, with the exception of the self-employed, as we mentioned above. The worker contribution is normally 7.65 percent, and thanks to the payroll tax rollback of 2010, the number this year is 5.65 percent. You can reach that number only by including the half of the tax that employers pay. Some economists say that if the employers\u2019 half of payroll taxes were ended, workers would see \u00a0a proportional rise in wages over the long run. But whatever the case, Cain was talking about the reality today. Workers don't pay a 15.3 percent payroll tax, so we rate Cain's statement Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-12279"}
