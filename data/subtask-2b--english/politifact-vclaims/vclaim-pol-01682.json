Which produces more emissions?", "text": "Wildfires have ravaged California again this year, destroying hundreds of homes and killing six firefighters, as well as several residents.\nThis year also produced the largest single fire in California\u2019s history, the Ranch Fire, which had burned more than 400,000 acres and spread across four counties near the Mendocino National Forest as of late August.\nSmoke\u00a0up and down the state, for days at a time, has blanketed metro areas miles from the fires, raising worries about air quality and pollution.\nThe wildfires have led some, including House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, to claim the blazes are spewing out more pollution than the state\u2019s millions of vehicles.\n\"I have a real concern about air quality because of where I come from,\" McCarthy, a Republican who represents the southern San Joaquin Valley, including Bakersfield, said during a speech\u00a0in Sacramento on Aug. 15, 2018. \"(We\u2019re at the) bottom of all the mountains and we collect (air pollution) all the way from San Francisco.\"\n\"What I have found, because of these fires, there are studies that are showing they are producing more emissions than all of our cars are doing,\" he added.\n\nSOURCE: Public Policy Institute of California\nWas McCarthy right?\nWe decided to fact-check his wildfires-versus-cars comparison.\nOur research\nSean Raffuse, an analyst at the UC Davis Air Quality Research Center, told us McCarthy\u2019s statement is correct, but for only for one category of emissions \u2014 particulate matter.\nThe claim is not true, however, for climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions, he said. Cars still produce far more of those.\nParticulate matter, or PM, is a mixture of microscopic particles and liquid droplets that, when inhaled, can affect the heart and lungs and cause serious health problems.\nFor months, officials have issued health warnings that particulate matter from the wildfires could trigger asthma attacks or aggravate chronic heart and lung diseases.\nSpecifically, Raffuse said, the fires produce more PM 2.5 than all cars. PM 2.5 refers to particles two and one half microns or less in width, or about thirty times smaller than that of a human hair.\n\"PM 2.5 emissions are greater than what we see from cars, and that\u2019s typical, not just of California during the wildfire season,\" he said, \"but even if you look overall at the nation for an entire year, there will be more emissions from particles from wildfires than there will be from motor vehicles.\"\nClean combustion regulations, he said, are one reason vehicles produce fewer particulate matter than fires.\nEarlier this month, the Trump administration proposed rules that would ease vehicle emissions standards nationwide. The proposal would also challenge the right of states, California in particular, to set their own, more stringent tailpipe pollution standards.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions\nBill Stewart, a researcher at the UC Berkeley Center for Forestry, said there\u2019s a key point missing from McCarthy\u2019s statement.\nWhile fires emit more particulate matter, cars produce far more greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide, he said.\n\"Those are two important but different issues,\" Stewart said.\nMike Kleeman, a UC Davis professor of environmental engineering, added that wildfires also emit some greenhouse gases.\n\"But burned areas also regrow during which time they act as a net carbon sink. \u00a0Assuming a burned area regrows completely over a time of decades, the net CO2 emissions should be low,\" Kleeman wrote in an email.\n\"Wildfires are a problem,\" he added, \"and we should be taking steps to reduce their frequency and intensity. But it isn't an \u2018apples to apples\u2019 comparison to an every-day source like cars.\"\nMcCarthy\u2019s response\nAsked for evidence supporting the claim, McCarthy\u2019s spokesman pointed to an October 2017 NBC News story that examined the emissions produced by that year\u2019s deadly Wine Country fires.\nThe story had the misleading headline: \"California Wildfires Emitted a Year's Worth of Car Pollution in Less Than a Week.\"\nIt quoted Raffuse of UC Davis, who told NBC the fires had released the same amount of particulate matter as come from California vehicles in one year. He didn\u2019t claim the fires had produced more of all types of emissions than cars.\nIn the article, the researcher \"pointed out cars pollute in other ways, too.\"\nRaffuse summed up the congressman\u2019s statement saying it\u2019s \"partially correct but omits a key distinction.\"\nMcCarthy\u2019s spokesman did not cite any specific studies to support the claim. We reviewed several that described wildfire emissions as a growing concern, but did not say they produce more pollution overall compared with cars.\nOne such report by the Sierra Nevada Conservancy in 2014 found that by the year 2085, emissions from wildfires are projected to be equal to the annual emissions of about one fifth of all of the cars currently registered in California.\nOur ruling\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy recently claimed \"because of these fires, there are studies that are showing they are producing more emissions than all of our cars are doing.\"\nWildfires produce more of one key pollutant, particulate matter, than cars, both in California and nationwide. But that\u2019s all.\nMcCarthy cherry-picked this one category and ignored the fact that cars produce far more greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide, than fires.\nWe rate McCarthy\u2019s claim Half True.\n\nHALF TRUE\u00a0\u2013 The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.\nClick here for\u00a0more\u00a0on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.\nCORRECTION: This article has been corrected to show Mike Kleeman is a professor at UC Davis, not at UC Berkeley.\n Share the Facts 2018-08-29 21:29:25 UTC   PolitiFact    4 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Half True  Studies are showing California\u2019s wildfires \"are producing more emissions than all of our cars are doing.\"    Kevin McCarthy House Majority Leader https://www.ppic.org/event/a-conversation-with-congressman-kevin-mccarthy-2018/    Wednesday, August 15, 2018 2018-08-15    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01682"}
