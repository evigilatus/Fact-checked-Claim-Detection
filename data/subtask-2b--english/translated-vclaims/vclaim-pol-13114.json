Onterman, a Republican, was speaking in support of the 87th House of Representatives Bill, legislation aimed at curbing illegal immigration in Georgia. In large part, according to party lines, the Senate voted in favour of the draft law, submitted by the Government. Nathan said he'd sign the law. The former nurse said that some people in her area complained to her that they couldn't get into the hospital's emergency room because they were often full of illegal immigrants. We wondered whether Onterman was right about her claim. The spokesman for the Gwynette Beth Okun Medical Center confirmed that she has a negative operating margin so far this fiscal year, which ends on June 30, with approximately $7 million. This means about 2 percent of the system &apos; s annual budget. Onterman, Gwynette Medical Center, said he had been in black for several years before. So why is the Gwynette Medical Center, which has medical facilities in Lawrenceville and Duluth, in financial trouble this fiscal year? Are illegal immigrants partly blamed for red ink? The cost of basic care at the Goinette Medical Centre, which includes medical care and medical aid, has almost quadrupled since 2000, according to our review of the Centre &apos; s annual reports. The Gwynette Medical Center has a funding gap of $20 million to pay for medical care, and Okon said to explain some of the shortfall. The centre receives 80 cents of the cost of medical care for every dollar it spends on the care of the medical care recipients, according to Okun. The spokesman for the Georgian Hospital Association Kevin Blewe said that more Georgians were losing their health insurance, and hospitals treated a larger proportion of uninsured patients, which were likely to include illegal immigrants. Okun referred to other financial problems. The Gwynette Medical Centre also lacks $1.1 million due to service providers' fees, also known as \"family tax,\" approved by state legislators in 2010. Okun said that the Goinette Medical Center had balanced its books by reducing certain expenses and seeing an increase in its investment income. The hospital system had reduced 160 locations in November. The officials stressed that the Goinette Medical Centre was not in long-term financial danger. So is Ontmann right about this funding shortfall as a result in part of illegal immigrants without health insurance drowning in the emergency room? Okun and others said that there was no clear way to answer that question. Okun said the hospital system doesn't ask patients about their immigration status. \"The problem is that we can't quantify it,\" said Bluey. Hospitals do not ask patients whether they are legal or illegal. The number of illegal immigrants in Georgia is estimated at 425,000, according to a study conducted in February by the Spanish centre Pio, whose figures on these subjects are widely accepted by political leaders and some government officials. This estimate represents about 4.4 per cent of Georgia &apos; s 9.7 million inhabitants. The study does not estimate how much Georgia spends on health care for illegal immigrants. There is little research on this subject. A 2006 report on the cost of health care for migrants in the L.A. District by RAND Corp., a non-profit research organization, revealed that per capita expenditure in one year on illegal immigrants of men and women was 39 per cent and 54 per cent, respectively, of the population born in the country. The study also found that illegal immigrants there carry out fewer visits to a doctor because they consider themselves to be in better health and have less access to health care. The American Immigration Reform Union, whose data are often used by some Georgian legislators, issued a report in July and revised it in February and found that Georgia spends more than $317 million annually on medical care for illegal immigrants. These costs include Medicaid, the State Children &apos; s Health Insurance Programme, child health care and emergency delivery. Georgia spends about $1.4 billion annually on medical care and health care, as State officials say. If the figures are correct, illegal immigrants account for 22 per cent of these costs. The Federation included United States children born of illegal immigrants, but the Constitution guaranteed citizenship to any child born in that country. Some organizations have been accused of xenophobia. :: Washington, D.C., criticized the Federal Government &apos; s efforts to prevent illegal immigrants from working within the United States, noting in its letter to legislators that the federal Hill-Burton Act, which requires certain health-care facilities to provide free or reduced care if the patient is unable to afford it, does not require United States citizenship to obtain eligibility. However, it considers that the beneficiary must have lived in the United States for at least three months. Senator Philip Wolff, Chief Executive Officer of the Gwynette Medical Center, explained some of his financial problems before the legislative session of the year began. Onterman told us she didn't have any scientific research into the financial impact of illegal immigrants on Gonet's medical center, but she said there was a significant impact on some calls she received from people in her area. \"I think it's too dangerous when you get calls from your voters,\" told us. We found that Onterman was right about the troubled finances of the Goinette Medical Center for the current budget year. The senator may also be right about illegal immigrants being part of the reason why the status is negative. However, there are no concrete figures on the amount of illegal immigrants who charge the centre. It can be a significant burden on its funds or a small weakness on the data table. Under current reporting requirements, figures are not verifiable. Without this additional information, Unterminant &apos; s claim is assessed as half a right.
