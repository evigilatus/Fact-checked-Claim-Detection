He\u2019s not.", "text": "When Rebecca Holcombe stepped down as education secretary in March 2018, she went quietly despite apparent rifts with Gov. Phil Scott. When she announced last week that she was running to take Scott\u2019s job, she came out swinging.\u00a0\n\"I joined Gov. Scott\u2019s administration because I took him at his word that he was serious about working to make Vermont more affordable and more equitable. I resigned when I realized that was just talk,\" Holcombe said in a statement announcing her run for governor in 2020.\u00a0\n\"We need to create opportunity for every Vermonter to make our communities stronger,\" she added, \"but unfortunately, Gov. Scott is pushing for a statewide voucher program that would take millions from our public schools and funnel it to private schools that mostly serve privileged families. I simply couldn\u2019t sit quietly by while our governor was pushing policies that left so many Vermonters behind.\"\nIt\u2019s no secret that Scott\u2019s positions on education funding are unpopular with Democrats and much of the education community. His proposal to increase staff-to-student ratio in schools \u2014 in part by having teachers take on classes outside their expertise \u2014 was derided as soon as it arrived in the Statehouse near the end of the 2018 legislative session.\u00a0\nBut Holcombe\u2019s claim that Scott is \"pushing for a statewide voucher program\" seemed to open a new line of attack against the governor \u2014 one that was sure to strike a nerve with those worried about how Scott\u2019s small-government philosophy will guide his education plans.\nSuch a change would revolutionize the relationship between Vermont communities and their schools. It would essentially create a free market for education, giving parents and guardians an annual voucher and letting them send their children to the school of their choice \u2014 independent or public \u2014 as opposed to the one in their district.\u00a0\nSeven Days\u00a0and the Rutland Herald\u00a0have already looked into Holcombe\u2019s attention-grabbing claim, which is still posted on her campaign website. We decided the first shot fired in the 2020 gubernatorial race was worth putting to the Politifact test.\u00a0\nHolcombe declined to be interviewed on the record about her claim, but sent an emailed statement defending her statement.\n\"As the Secretary of Education, I spoke weekly with the heads of Gov. Scott\u2019s administration and they made clear that their priority was protecting and expanding private school vouchers, including to schools that don't serve all students,\" she said in an emailed statement Tuesday.\u00a0\nHolcombe also pointed to a memo from her successor as education secretary, Dan French, \"detailing their proposal to create a single statewide school district and statewide voucher program by expanding school choice to non-sectarian independent schools in every part of the state.\"\u00a0\nThat memo, titled \"Designing Our Future: A Blueprint for Transforming Vermont\u2019s Education System,\" was provided to VTDigger in December and then discussed openly before the State Board of Education in March.\nAccording to the memo itself, it was developed with participation from the governor\u2019s office and his cabinet, including the secretaries of Commerce and Community Development, Digital Services and Human Services, the commissioner of Labor.\nIt says in part: \"The system would consist of a single statewide school district. Students would have statewide school choice among all the public schools, technical centers, and non-sectarian independent schools approved by the Agency.\"\nHowever, the preface to the memo also says: \"This document represents the work of a visioning exercise conducted within the Vermont Agency of Education to begin to imagine the design of a modern education system.\"\nResponding to questions from state board members in March, French said the memo was intended as a starting place for discussion about the future of Vermont schools, rather than a final policy proposal.\u00a0\nFrench said the two most controversial ideas laid out in his memo \u2014 a statewide voucher system and a single statewide school district \u2014 were not final answers but rather an effort to spark new ideas to address systemic challenges.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe secretary said he was looking for ways \"to stimulate a conversation and interest in the future around our policy design.\" French said Vermont needed to come up with a more efficient way to manage it\u2019s schools, both for cost control and to achieve better student outcomes.\n\"My conclusion is the system is overly complex, especially when considering the scale of the system, meaning the number of school districts and the number of students,\" he said. \"Complexity is the chief cause of our inefficiency.\"\nOne logical solution to the problem of complexity, French said, was a single school district. And in order to give parents maximum flexibility in this system, he added, expanding vouchers would break down barriers within the system.\u00a0\n\"That\u2019s where I come to the school choice idea, it\u2019s not as a philosophy, it\u2019s if we had fewer barriers there\u2019s more flexibility,\" he explained.\u00a0\n\"But the idea would be, well, if you don\u2019t like that conclusion, let\u2019s go back and have a serious conversation about design elements.\"\nSo does French\u2019s memo, combined with his appearance at the state board, amount to the Scott administration \"pushing\" a statewide voucher program?\nWithout knowing more about internal conversations that Holcombe may have been a part of, it\u2019s hard to say. But French\u2019s tepid presentation before the board, speaking about a memo explicitly described as a conversation starter, does not amount to the administration pushing policy.\u00a0\nSpeaking on Vermont Public Radio on the same week the Blueprint was leaked publicly, Scott said he gave French \"great credit\" for bringing new ideas to the table. But he also suggested such a radical transformation was not the works.\n\"I don\u2019t think we\u2019re ready for anything like that at this point,\" he said of the single school-district idea.\nEthan Latour, a spokesperson for Scott, said in an email this week that the governor supports the expansion of vouchers if that decision is made at the local level.\u00a0\n\"The Governor supports school choice and thinks it\u2019s a valuable tool for parents,\" Latour wrote. \"If the electorate of a school district or supervisory union feels similarly about choice among the schools within its boundaries \u2013 and to be clear these are public schools in most cases \u2013 the Governor would support those local decisions.\"\nLatour added that the governor would like to see districts that have merged under Act 46 offer school choice to families within those new, sometimes multischool, districts. \"This option, encouraged by current law, increases options for children and parents and helps local education districts preserve and expand academic programs,\" he said.\u00a0\nSo it\u2019s clear that Scott does support expanding school choice, though not necessarily on a statewide scale. His usual spokesperson, Rebecca Kelley (who was on vacation this week), clarified earlier this month that the governor \"has not proposed or pursued a statewide voucher program.\"\nOur ruling\nHolcome said \"Gov. Scott is pushing for a statewide voucher program that would take millions from our public schools and funnel it to private schools that mostly serve privileged families.\"\nThe former education secretary relies on a memo and State Board Meeting in which Scott\u2019s education secretary describes his vision for a statewide voucher program \u2014 in both cases with a clearly stated caveat that his proposal is meant to provoke a further conversation.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s possible that Scott would like the state to move toward the type of system described in French\u2019s memo, but he hasn\u2019t publicly advocated for it.\u00a0\nWithout knowing what Holcombe heard behind closed doors during her time in Scott\u2019s administration, we don\u2019t know whether her statement accurately conveys the administration\u2019s intentions. And Scott is open about his support for expanding vouchers \u2013 if communities themselves support the change.\u00a0\u00a0\nHowever, there is no publicly available evidence to support Holcombe\u2019s claim that the governor is pushing for a statewide voucher program. In fact, he has said explicitly that he doesn\u2019t support such a major change. We rate this claim mostly false.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00392"}
