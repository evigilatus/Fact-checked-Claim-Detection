There is excitement for the month-long tournament played every four years. But in Brazil, there is also unrest.\nDisappointed Brazilians are protesting the country\u2019s spending of more than $11 billion on infrastructure upgrades and stadiums to get ready for the tournament, with games spread across 12 cities in a country larger than the continental United States. Another sore spot is the role of soccer\u2019s governing body, the Federation Internationale de Football Association, or FIFA, which chose Brazil as the host country and will reap most of the profits from the mega event.\nSoccer fan and comedian John Oliver, host of HBO\u2019s Last Week Tonight, sought to illuminate soccer\u2019s dark side in his June 8 show. One project that epitomizes World Cup waste, he argued, is a new 42,000-seat stadium in a city within the Amazon rainforest that cost the country more than $300 million to build.\nThe city of Manaus is way, way, way off the beaten path. To emphasize how out of the way it is, Oliver pulled a TV news clip describing how stadium materials were shipped by boat from Portugal across the Atlantic Ocean and up the Amazon River.\n\"Okay, that does seem like a waste of money, especially when you consider that that stadium is only going to be used for four World Cup games,\" Oliver said. \"There\u2019s also no team in Manaus that can fill it afterwards, at which point it becomes the world\u2019s most expensive bird toilet.\"\nWe wanted to explore whether the stadium\u2019s only real purpose is four World Cup games.\nFIFA requires eight venues for the tournament\u2019s 64 matches, but Brazil selected 12 host cities. What seemed like an opportunity to share development, tourism and growth has posed logistical and financial problems around the country. Citing unfinished roads, stadiums and work areas, the mayor of Rio de Janeiro admitted \"we made a mistake\" in choosing a dozen hosts.\nManaus, located in the northwestern Brazilian state of Amazonas, may be the most peculiar choice. The historic city of 2 million attracts business from electronics and oil industries thanks to its status as a free economic zone. Still, it\u2019s mostly accessible by boat and air, nestled near the famous \"Meeting of the Waters,\" where the black Rio Negro and muddy Amazon meet but do not mix.\nGetting a World Cup-ready stadium ready in Manaus was an enormous feat, generating attention from the the Miami Herald, The New York Times, The Telegraph, the Los Angeles Times and Canada\u2019s CBC News, to name a few. An existing stadium with just 20,000 seats had to be torn down in order to build a stadium that meets FIFA regulations. Its replacement, the German-designed Arena Amazonia, looks like a giant woven straw basket, the seats inside painted in shades of tropical fruit.\nThe project got off to a slow start, and three men died during construction and there are questions\u00a0whether\u00a0the playing surface will be in decent shape.\nAs Oliver said, it will host just four games -- the first on June 14 between England and Italy. The U.S. team will face Portugal there June 22. The other matches are Cameroon vs. Croatia and Honduras vs. Switzerland.\nSo what\u2019s next after the four World Cup matches?\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManaus is not home to a top-tier Brazilian soccer team that might sustain big crowds when the World Cup is gone. The Miami Herald reported nonspecific plans for the stadium to host guest matches between Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo teams.\nA local team in the country\u2019s fourth soccer division, Nacional Futebol Clube, plans to play in the stadium when the World Cup ends. But a report from the Telegraph, and others, highlights low attendance figures of up to 1,000 fans for the team\u2019s games.\nThe Manaus stadium seats 42,000 people.\n\"We were careful with our wording to say that there is no \u2018team in Manaus that can fill it afterwards\u2019 \u2014 not to say that no one was going to play in it afterwards,\" reads a statement from the show\u2019s research team via an HBO spokeswoman. \"We knew that there are plans to use the stadium for other purposes, too, and that some people hope the stadium will bring increased popularity to the Nacional team.\n\"But we felt like we were justified to have a deep skepticism about those claims, especially given the cost just to maintain the facility \u2014 and we felt we were on safe ground to word the joke the way we had it.\"\nThis stadium is not the only project deemed by some as a \"white elephant.\" Brazilian soccer star-turned-congressman Rom\u00e1rio told the New York Times in 2013 that new stadiums in Manaus, Cuiaba and Natal \"are absurd.\"\n\"There will be a couple games there and then what? Who will go? It is an absolute waste of time and money,\" he said.\nFIFA spokeswoman Delia Fisher stressed that the government owns the stadium, not FIFA, and there are plans to \"privatize\" it after the World Cup. FIFA\u2019s website says the stadium in Manaus \"will continue to attract tourists after the tournament by hosting concerts and cultural events.\"\nThe 2016 Olympics will also be in Brazil, but the soccer matches and other Olympic events\u00a0will take place in the host city of Rio de Janeiro or surrounding cities, a four-hour flight to the south and east from Manaus.\nOur ruling\nOliver said Brazil built a $300 million stadium in the Amazon rainforest that \"is only going to be used for four World Cup games,\" and there\u2019s no team \"that can fill it afterwards.\"\nHis point is accurate. There are hopes and dreams for the stadium\u2019s life when the World Cup is over, and locals hope it spurs more interest in local soccer teams in Manaus and can be used for big-ticket concerts and conferences. But the stadium, based on what we know, largely will sit unused.\nWe rate Oliver\u2019s claim True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07754"}
