This bill is a nightmare. #StopCCR\u2014 Rep. Brendan Boyle (@CongBoyle) December 5, 2017\n\nAs the House-passed bill moves to the Senate, we decided to look at whether Boyle\u2019s claim about the effects on state gun laws was correct. It turns out his read on the bill is misleading.\nConcealed-carry reciprocity\nHistorically, each state has determined its own scheme for regulating concealed carry, which led to the current patchwork of varying laws and standards across the country.\nThirty-eight states require gun owners to obtain a state-issued permit before than can lawfully carry a concealed weapon in public. A dozen states \u2014 as Boyle noted \u2014 require no permit.\nTraditionally, states have decided for themselves whether to honor out-of-state permits, a legal concept known as \"reciprocity.\"\nUnder the broad strokes of the House-passed Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, having a concealed-carry permit issued by one state makes it legal to carry in any state.\nAnd according to Boyle, the Republican measure would supersede state and local laws concerning the carry of concealed weapons in school zones.\nBut a close reading of the interplay between the House-passed bill and state gun laws shows that\u2019s not the case.\nThe Gun-Free School Zones Act\nBefore discussing what Boyle gets wrong, it\u2019s worth noting that his claim would have been more accurate if he\u2019d taken aim at federal law, not state law.\nThe federal Gun-Free School Zones Act generally prohibits concealed carry in a school zone, which is defined as a distance of 1,000 feet from the grounds of a public, parochial or private school.\nBut the law makes an exception for people who hold a concealed carry permit from the state in which the school zone is located, according to David Kopel, a policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo under the Gun-Free School Zones Act, a permit issued by State A would allow you to legally carry in a school zone located in State A, but not a school zone in State B, Kopel said.\nBut the bill the House voted on says that people with concealed-carry permits aren\u2019t subject to the restrictions in the Gun-Free School Zones Act.\nIn other words, Kopel said, if you had a permit from State A, and carried a gun into a school zone in State B, you would face no penalty under the Gun-Free School Zones Act.\nSo Boyle would have been accurate to say the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act overrides federal law concerning the carry of concealed weapons in a school zone. But his claim was about state and local laws.\nBill does not supersede state law\nBoyle specifically said the bill would allow residents of one of the dozen states that allow permitless concealed carry to \"walk right into a school zone with a loaded weapon, no matter what local laws say.\"\nA large majority of states prohibit non-school employees from carrying in schools, even with a concealed carry permit. So if Boyle were correct, the House bill would stand to cancel out a great deal of gun regulation at the state level.\nBut the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act clearly states that it does not supersede state law \u2014 the opposite of Boyle's claim.\nUnder the bill, permit-holders would still be subject to any state or local laws that restrict the carry of a gun in a school or a designated zone around it. The bill reads:\n\"This section shall not be construed to supersede or limit the laws of any state that permit private persons or entities to prohibit or restrict the possession of concealed firearms on their property, or prohibit or restrict the possession of firearms on any state or local government property, installation, building, base, or park.\"\nSo if the bill becomes law, states would still be free to ban the carry of guns in school zones \u2014 and the federal law would also yield to any future laws passed by the minority of states that now generally allow concealed-carry permit holders to carry in schools.\n\"That\u2019s precisely the opposite of Boyle\u2019s point, which was local laws are irrelevant,\" said Adam Winkler, law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles.\nJoseph Blocher, a law professor at Duke University who specializes in federal and state constitutional law, agreed that Boyle\u2019s statement is misleading.\n\"If the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act passes, someone from a permitless state could walk into a school zone without violating any federal law, since HR 38 basically rescinds the Gun Free School Zones Act,\" he said. \"But the part about \u2018no matter what local laws say\u2019 isn\u2019t right.\"\nOur ruling\nBoyle said the concealed carry bill would allow residents of certain states to \"travel to your community and walk right into a school zone with a loaded weapon, no matter what local laws say.\"\nWhile the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act would override a federal law concerning the carry of concealed weapons in a school zone, Boyle is wrong about how the bill would affect state and local gun laws.\nConcealed carry permit-holders \u2014 and residents of the dozen states that allow permitless concealed carry \u2014 would still be subject to any state or local laws that prohibit or restrict the carry of a gun in a school or a designated zone around it.\nWe rate this False.\n Share the Facts 2017-12-07 22:08:37 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  Says the concealed carry bill would allow residents of certain states to \"travel to your community and walk right into a school zone with a loaded weapon, no matter what local laws say.\"    Brendan Boyle U.S. Rep, D-Pa. https://twitter.com/CongBoyle/status/938102762625208321?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.politifact.com%2Ftruth-o-meter%2Fstatements%2F2017%2Fdec%2F07%2Fbrendan-boyle%2Fno-gop-concealed-carry-bill-does-not-block-states-%2F   in a tweet Thursday, December 7, 2017 2017-12-07    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02618"}
