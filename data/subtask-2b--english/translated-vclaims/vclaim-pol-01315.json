No act of gun violence can be accepted. I'm in close contact with law enforcement officials and I'm going back to Talahassi tonight, \"Gelum's tweeting Friday night. This story was highlighted as part of Facebook &apos; s efforts to combat false news and misleading information in the broadcast of the news. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The codification does not justify much of its misleading title and the main paragraph. The article \"Greou\" does not mention any source of Gillum's announcement of an indefinite suspension of his campaign, but identifies what happened during the shooting on Friday, where Scott Paul Pearl killed two people and wounded five people in the yoga studio in Talahasi before killing himself, according to Guardian. According to the article Griew, the armed man \"is said to have a history of arrests to extract women,\" and links to the United States article today published by Nov 3, which examines Peryl's background. The e-mails sent to Giroo on Saturday were all answered. There was no immediate response to an e-mail sent to the author of the article and letters sent to the Gilom campaign. She quoted Gilom's tweet from Friday in the article, along with the remarks made by the Democratic Talahasi who stated that he was approaching the shooting site. The Grio site is similar to New York's second article in the Daily News, entitled \"Founder of Florida, Governor Andrew Gillum, stops the campaign after two deaths in Talahasi.\" In his November 3 article, the Ranger wrote that Gillum \"tweeted that he was leaving the trail of the campaign to return to Talahasi.\" In any case, there is no evidence that Gilom is \"indeterminately stopping his election campaign for the Governor\" after the shooting on Friday, as the site of Grio claims. On January 10, 2021, in an article on Facebook, he said that Nancy Belusi had sent a letter to the Mayor of Portland after demonstrations there \"to demand that he stick to the proven democratic playbook.\" On Saturday afternoon, political journalist Palm Beach Post, George Bennett, tweeted Jillum's pictures at Jimmy Buffett's concert. The concert was organized in West Palm Beach \"To Gather Voters Before Tuesday's Election Day,\" according to an article in November by Miami Herald. Bennett tweeted Gellum's photos with Norman Lear and Nelson, noting that both Gillum and Nelson \"gone with Kaki/Blue T-shirt\" at the rally. Guillaume also rewrites Bay 9 news and 13 news from the Florida newspaper, Capitol Troy Kinsey reporter, on November 3, on Twitter, which showed Gillum on stage talking to the crowd in West Palm Beach. Similarly, Orlando Sentinel Nov 2 reported that Gillum was scheduled to join other politicians and celebrities at the University of Central Florida to mobilize students on Saturday. In press releases to the campaign sent on Saturday, the Guillaume campaign said that the events of the campaign would be held throughout the day. \"Saturday, 3 November, the Governor's Jellum bus tour \"Bring her home\" will continue to stop all over southern and central Florida. The Governor of Virginia Ralph Northham will organize a campaign for Mayor Gillum in Lake Worth, followed by a \"out of voting\" event at the University of the South Pacific, which will conclude today at the Jimmy Buffett GOV concert in West Palm Beach, \"an e-mail for the campaign was sent at 12.06 a.m. in November 3. According to e-mail, Gillum was scheduled to speak in Orlando and West Palm Beach on Saturday. The Gilom campaign also supported politicians and sent notices of further campaign events in additional e-mails on Saturday. The story of 13 Spectrum Spectrum News also showed what Gillum was up to Saturday, with time-stamped updates. Our article from the Grue newspaper claimed that Gillum was indeterminately stopping his campaign to the governor in the light of a fatal shooting in Talahasi at the yoga studio on Friday. While Gilom left the campaign to return to Talahasi and met with some of the victims, he would not finish his campaign for governorship because of the shooting.
