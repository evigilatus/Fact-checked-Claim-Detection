Those numbers are preliminary, but the most recent available. In any case, that\u2019s double the rate cited by Pence.\nWe reached out to Pence\u2019s office seeking backup for the claim, but they did not offer an explanation for the discrepancy.\u00a0\nBut our examination of the numbers found the news release appears to be citing the March 2020 unemployment rate. The rate was that low \u2013 3.1% \u2013 at the time, but climbed dramatically in the wake of COVID-fueled shutdowns across the country.\nHere is the fuller picture: When Trump took office in January 2017, the Wisconsin unemployment rate was at 3.6%, and had been on a downward trend through 2016.\nIn 2017, the unemployment rate continued to decrease and then held steady for some months at 3%. It was at 3.1% in January 2019, and gradually increased until a sharp decline between February 2020 (3.5%) and March 2020 (3.1%).\nBut it has spiked since then.\nIn short, Pence used outdated numbers to paint a rosier-than-reality picture.\nOverall job numbers\nThe second number the release cites is the number of jobs added in Wisconsin.\nThe difference between the January 2017 numbers, when Trump took office, and the preliminary numbers for August 2020 shows a net loss of 181,900 jobs in Wisconsin.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Steineke\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembly Republicans \u201chave come to the table\u201d and were part of \u201cgive and take\u201d compromise on a coronavirus bill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you use February 2017, the month after President Trump\u2019s inauguration, as a starting point, there is an even bigger net loss of 185,000 Wisconsin jobs.\u00a0\nTo be sure, there are many cautions about this approach. The preliminary numbers can sometimes change considerably before they are made final. And the BLS prefers to compare year-over-year numbers \u2013 i.e. January to January \u2013 due to seasonal employment changes.\nBut the comparison underlines a stark difference due to the economic fallout of coronavirus \u2013 something ignored by Pence\u2019s numbers.\nIn any case, it\u2019s unclear where Pence\u2019s office got the increase of 61,000 jobs. Despite our request, they did not offer an explanation.\nWe looked at the numbers in a variety of ways, including whether they represented a high-water mark for some point during his presidency, but could not crack the code.\nOne way to get 61,000 jobs is to take the difference between October 2016 \u2013 when President Trump had not been elected, let alone took office \u2013 (2,932,700 nonfarm jobs) and February 2020 (2,993,700 nonfarm jobs), the highest tally under Trump.\u00a0\nManufacturing jobs number\nThe same ignore-the-pandemic problem holds here.\nBetween January 2017 and August 2020 there was a net loss of 9,200 manufacturing jobs in Wisconsin.\u00a0\nIt seems Pence\u2019s office got the 15,000 gain by taking the difference between January 2017 and March 2020.\nTaking credit\nIn the news release, Pence\u2019s office said the administration \"enacted pro-growth policies, which led\" to the numbers cited.\nThat leads us to the issue of credit and blame \u2013 something we always consider when politicians make such boasts. For instance, when former Gov. Scott Walker touted similar numbers when in office, economists noted he could not take full credit because the state is affected by many national and global economic forces and trends. The same scenario applies here, in reverse.\u00a0\nFinally, it\u2019s worth noting that Trump has argued he should be judged mainly on how the economy was performing before the pandemic.\u00a0 But he has taken credit for recent bounceback growth and noted \u2013 especially when defending his late-in-term Supreme Court nomination \u2013 that he is elected to a full four-year term, not a partial term.\nWhat\u2019s more, the news release itself used the phrase \"since President Trump took office,\" not \"in the first 38 months of President Trump\u2019s term.\"\nOur ruling\nPence claimed in a news release that since he and Trump took office, their policies \"led to an unemployment rate of 3.1% in Wisconsin and 61,000 jobs, including 15,000 manufacturing jobs.\"\nThose numbers may have been high-water marks before the pandemic, but they ignore the current reality. Even then, they overstate the credit for improvements that are driven by many economic forces.\nWe rate Pence\u2019s claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18734"}
