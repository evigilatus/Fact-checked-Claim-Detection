Mitt Romney has taken aim at President Donald Trump before, but he never said Trump should resign because of \"serious emotional problems,\" despite what one false headline would have readers believe.\n\"Mitt Romney: \u2018Trump has some very serious emotional problems, he must resign before we\u2026\u2019,\" said a June 6, 2018, headline from International Flash News, an online blog. A few replica stories were posted under the same headline on other blog sites in May.\nFacebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe International Flash News story alleged that during an interview on CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper 360, Romney said Trump \"has some very serious emotional problems.\" The story also quoted Romney as suggesting Trump should resign over sexual misconduct claims and expressing concern regarding the president\u2019s tweets about North Korea and domestic race relations.\nWe searched for the headline in Google and Nexis and found no evidence that Romney made such a statement. Shimrit Sheetrit, director of Anderson Cooper 360, told us it has been several years since Romney was last featured as a guest on the show.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut as it turns out, we did find that the comments attributed to Romney in the false report were all at some point made by another former presidential candidate: U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, D-Vt.\nOn Dec. 13, 2017, Sanders joined the set of Anderson Cooper 360 and said Trump \"has some very serious emotional problems\" in reference to a Twitter attack Trump made against U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y. During the same interview, Sanders said Trump should resign because of the multiple sexual assault allegations levied against him.\nThe International Flash News story also included quotes that can be properly attributed to Sanders\u2019 statement on CBS This Morning on Dec. 7, 2017. And Sanders \u2014 not Romney \u2014 has on multiple occasions accused Trump of \"trying to divide us up by the color of our skin,\" including on Nov. 12, 2017, while visiting CBS\u2019s Face the Nation.\nSo the supposed Romney quote, along with several others included in the text of the story, is actually a misattribution of multiple different quotes from Sanders.
