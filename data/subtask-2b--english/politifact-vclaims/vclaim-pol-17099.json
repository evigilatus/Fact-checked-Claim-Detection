Our archives are full of accusations that someone would undermine Social Security or Medicare or both. Democrats accuse Republicans, Republicans accuse Democrats, and sometimes, Democrats accuse Democrats.\nBut Jones faces a special challenge in cornering Tuberville on policy.\nTuberville is a newly minted politician who spent most of the past 25 years coaching college football, including a decade at Auburn, one of Alabama\u2019s two powerhouse teams. Tuberville avoided any debates during the primary, and his interviews were more about values than policy.\nOn these entitlement programs, Tuberville has given few details. In looking at what he has said, Tuberville has expressed an interest in private investment accounts as a substitute for Social Security, but said nothing about what that would look like. He said federal entitlement spending should come down, but said nothing about what he had in mind. A newspaper reported that he said he opposes cuts to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.\nParticularly on Medicare, Jones\u2019 ad stretches what\u2019s known about Tuberville\u2019s views.\u00a0\nSocial Security\nTuberville has called Social Security a \"good\" program. According to one newspaper article, he told voters outside a Montgomery restaurant in February that he opposed cuts to defense, Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.\nTuberville did touch on changing how Social Security should be funded in three early interviews shortly after he launched his campaign in the spring of 2019. Tuberville twice floated the idea of people putting their Social Security contributions into a stock market account similar to 401(k) retirement funds. He mentioned it briefly in an April 24, 2019, interview with television station WRBL.\u00a0\nTuberville got into more details with radio host Dale Jackson on May 2, 2019. Jackson brought up the deficit and asked Tuberville what could be done about Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Tuberville mentioned a hybrid Social Security system, proposed by President George W. Bush, where people could choose to put some of their contributions into relatively low-risk stock market funds. The effort stalled as public concerns grew and opponents tagged it as privatization.\nHere\u2019s the full exchange between Tuberville and Jackson:\nTuberville: \"What we have got to do is start a 401(k) for everybody. I think President Bush was for this.\"\u00a0\nJackson: \"So, you want to do away with Social Security and start 401(k)s.\"\nTuberville: \"Well, this would be Social Security, but you would put the 7% in \u2014\"\nJackson: \"But it\u2019s there, as opposed to being spent elsewhere.\"\nTuberville: \"And the government can\u2019t spend it. If we don\u2019t do it, you\u2019re not going to have any money. So, it\u2019s Social Security, but it\u2019s a 401(k). Retirement planning, that was what Social Security was meant to be. It\u2019s not a slush fund.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL. Lin Wood\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in an interview with the Patriotically Correct Radio Show\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"China was behind the interference and the effort to overthrow our government and the election, election fraud.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Daniel Funke \u2022 January 19, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivatization can be difficult to define. To some experts, Tuberville\u2019s words come close.\n\"Privatization is often used more when the 401(k) is used as a substitute and tries to make use of current revenues to Social Security,\" said Eugene Steuerle, cofounder of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.\nThe Tuberville campaign rejected the privatization label and said he never got so specific. Research consultant and spokesman Gary Maloney said during the Jackson interview, Tuberville was \"spitballing.\"\u00a0\n\"Neither then nor now has he committed to any changes,\" Maloney said. \"Coach (Tuberville) is furious about politicians stealing the Social Security money of seniors, and he wants that solved.\"\nAsked if Tuberville would consider the 401(k) option today, Maloney told PolitiFact \"the 401(k) proposal is off the table.\"\nWe asked the Tuberville campaign for any evidence that Tuberville had publicly rejected the 401(k) notion before we called. There seems to be none. At the time of the Jones ad, Tuberville\u2019s statements on people putting their Social Security contributions into a personal investment account were the most detailed available.\nSteuerle affirmed that Social Security presents a daunting puzzle. As more people retire, there are fewer workers paying in to cover the cost of the money going out.\nMedicare\nTuberville has said even less about Medicare than he has about Social Security.\nThe closest he came was in a radio interview with Scott Dawson early in his campaign. Tuberville was talking about both Social Security and Medicare running out of money.\n\"Our elected officials have taken our money and blown it,\" Tuberville said July 30, 2019. \"Kicking the can down the road and trying to do other things we have no business doing, and it\u2019s just an absolute disaster, and I don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to do. I really don\u2019t. We\u2019ve got to make adjustments soon. We\u2019re about to run over the cliff.\"\u00a0\nIn the May 2019 interview with Jackson, when asked about what he would cut, Tuberville said, \"Well it goes back to entitlements, where most of our money is spent.\"\nThe Jones campaign told us that since entitlements include Medicare, Tuberville was open to cuts to the program.\nThe Tuberville campaign said in a statement, \"Coach Tuberville has not discussed cutting Medicare or changing the program in any way.\"\nOur ruling\nThe Jones campaign said Tuberville supports privatizing Social Security and cutting Medicare. At the time of the ad, Tuberville had said he was interested in allowing people to direct their Social Security payments into a 401(k)-type account, which matches some definitions of privatization.\nThe Tuberville campaign says now that he is not interested in the 401(k) option, but that was not public knowledge at the time of the Jones campaign ad.\nEarly on, Tuberville spoke generically about favoring cuts in entitlements, but he did not mention Medicare. He told voters at a campaign stop in February that he opposed cuts in Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.\nThere\u2019s some support for the ad\u2019s claim about Social Security given his initial comments. But the ad is wrong about his views on Medicare.\nWe rate this claim Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17099"}
