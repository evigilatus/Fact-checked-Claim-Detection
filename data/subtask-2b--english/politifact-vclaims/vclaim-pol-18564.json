According to a recently unsealed indictment filed in the Western District of Pennsylvania, Soros has been charged with a number of serious crimes relating to the US election.\"\nThis is bogus. Soros has not been indicted or arrested. The indictment depicted in the article was forged to include his name and was created from a real indictment involving Russian hackers.\nThe story was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe fake indictment lists charges for conspiracy, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, damage to computers, aggravated identity theft and aiding and abetting.\u00a0\nA reverse-image search revealed that it was digitally manipulated using a real indictment from Oct. 15 that involved six Russian nationals who were allegedly behind a number of high-profile cyber attacks and accused of being hackers with Russian military intelligence.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.

A representative from his Open Society Foundations called the claim \"entirely false.\"\nThe article says no other media organizations are reporting the story because a judge in the case ordered a \"publication ban.\"\nBut there is no such thing.\u00a0\nU.S. judges do not have the power to stop journalists from reporting on a case. They can only order individuals involved not to speak with the press.\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s legal team has amplified the baseless conspiracy theory that Soros, as well as local and state elections officials, antifa, China, and Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez (who died in 2013), are involved in rigging the presidential election in favor of Joe Biden.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nArticles circulating on social media claim that George Soros was indicted and arrested in Philadelphia for \"election interference.\"\nThis is bogus. The story includes no sources and uses a forged indictment as its sole evidence of the claim.\nThis is full-on Pants on Fire!\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections FactChat #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click here for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18564"}
