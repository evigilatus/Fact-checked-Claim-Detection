She could face a $1,000 fine. One of the people Colbert met for his ironic report was Howard Simone, CEO of the American Civil Liberties Union in Florida. Florida officials claimed that they needed to pass the law to prevent voter fraud, but these cases are in fact very rare, as he said. \"There may be more shark attacks in Florida than there are cases of voter fraud,\" he said. We were unable to resist diving: Are there more attacks on sharks than cases of voter fraud in Florida? We compiled this chart using data from the Florida State Department, which monitors the elections, and the Florida Museum of Natural History in Gainesville, which has a famous department of geology. ==History===The science of germs is the study of fish.) The figures for shark attacks include documented cases of sharks attacking human victims. The cases of voter fraud indicate the number of cases considered legally sufficient for an investigation by the Florida Law Enforcement Department. The total number of shark attacks 28 19 14* verified by Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden on the video \"Violation\" in the election in \"Acknowledgment.\" By Bill McCarthy: 12 January 2021 11 72 cases of voter fraud 16 9 10 14 49. However, the publication of our data over four years shows that shark attacks occur more frequently than cases of voter fraud. Florida regularly leads the country in unwarranted shark attacks. In 2011, the 11 Florida attacks accounted for 38 per cent of all State attacks and 15 per cent of the world &apos; s attacks. Volussia County is home to Mika Spring Beach in Daytona. While the shark attack numbers are cut and dry (Sorry! ) The voter fraud numbers are not. There can be more cases than we know, involving more people. These figures may not represent the total number of cases of voter fraud, which can be handled by local supervisors and government lawyers. Also, one case may represent several charges of voter fraud committed by multiple persons, the Agency &apos; s spokesperson Chris Kate. He refers to the November 2011 case, which resulted in the arrest of nine persons from Madison, North Florida, including the election supervisor. On the other hand, the list of fraud does not only count convictions. Some of these cases can therefore be shown to be unfounded. The Union's claim is true in his face, but we keep it out of our hands, taking into account some things. First, the State count does not represent a whole range of potential frauds being prosecuted in the State. Second, \"case\" does not always involve only one case of fraud. Using Madison's case as an example, we know that nine people have been arrested in just one case. We're assessing this mostly right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11501"}
