That\u2019s a distortion of the elections process.\nTrump on Nov. 4 tweeted that \"they are finding Biden votes all over the place \u2014 in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan.\"\nIn another tweet, Trump said: \"Last night I was leading, often solidly, in many key States, in almost all instances Democrat run & controlled. Then, one by one, they started to magically disappear as surprise ballot dumps were counted. VERY STRANGE, and the \"pollsters\" got it completely & historically wrong!\"\n\"Oh Wisconsin found 112k votes at 3am\u2026,\" said a Nov. 4 Facebook post.\nThe Facebook post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

But he said that perhaps the post was alluding to counts of absentee ballots.\nThe most populous county in Wisconsin, Milwaukee County, has 19 municipalities.

The City of Milwaukee was still counting absentee ballots around 3 a.m., but that doesn\u2019t mean that those ballots were found or appeared at that time.\nWe rate the Facebook post False.\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click here, for more.\nRELATED: Fact-checking the avalanche of Wisconsin election misinformation", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18446"}
