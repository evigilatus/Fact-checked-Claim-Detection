But they\u2019re still just estimates.\nUndocumented workers\nThere is no official count of undocumented workers who pay federal income taxes. But Clinton\u2019s claim \u2014 that half of all undocumented workers pay federal income taxes \u2014 is an educated assumption that many experts use, said Kim Rueben, senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.\n\"As far as we can vet it, it is true,\" Rueben said.\nFor reference, the Tax Policy Center estimates that 56 percent of the entire population pays federal income tax, while 44 percent don\u2019t.\nSocial Security is one way we know undocumented workers pay federal income taxes. The Social Security Administration estimated that in 2009, 3.1 million unauthorized workers paid into Social Security via payroll tax, even though most will not be able to collect those benefits. In addition to Social Security, payroll taxes also withhold federal income taxes from a worker\u2019s paycheck.\nThere\u2019s also the Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, or ITIN, which people who are unable to obtain Social Security numbers use to pay income taxes, regardless of immigration status. In 2013, 4.3 million people filed tax returns using ITINs. ITIN filers paid $9 billion in payroll taxes in 2014.\nMost people with an ITIN are undocumented immigrants, said Ruth Wasem, a public policy professor at the University of Texas. The number of people signing up for ITINs and paying taxes that way has grown over the past few years, particularly because many immigration reform proposals require undocumented immigrants to prove they have been paying taxes in order to qualify for some sort of legal status, Wasem said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

Going against decades of tradition for presidential nominees, Trump has so far refused to release his tax returns.\nWe know there have been at least a few years Trump didn\u2019t pay federal income taxes and that tax write-offs are generally beneficial to real estate developers like Trump. Three pages of Trump\u2019s 1995 tax returns, uncovered and verified by the New York Times, show it\u2019s possible he was able to legally avoid paying federal income tax for as much as 18 years.\nA tax provision known as net operating loss allows people to report business losses on their personal tax returns as a deduction. So if a person\u2019s reported net operating loss is equal to or larger than their personal income, that person does not have to pay income taxes. Trump\u2019s $916 million loss reported in his 1995 tax return could counteract any income he earned that year and beyond, up to 18 years total under IRS rules in 1995, according to the New York Times.\nGoing back a few more years, a 1981 report by New Jersey gambling regulators analyzed five years of Trump's finances as part of his efforts to get a casino license for a proposed casino-hotel complex. The report says Trump paid federal taxes for three of those five years, 1975-77, but he did not pay federal income tax in 1978 and 1979.\nSo in the years Trump paid zero federal income taxes, undocumented immigrants who paid any federal income taxes presumably would have paid more than him.\nBut Clinton\u2019s claim is phrased in the present. Without Trump\u2019s current tax returns, we simply don\u2019t know what his tax burden is today. So in the most recent tax year, we don\u2019t know who paid more in federal income tax, Trump or an undocumented worker.\nOur ruling\nClinton said, \"One-half of undocumented workers pay federal income taxes, which means they are paying more federal income taxes than Donald Trump pays.\"\nWhile there is no official figure, experts estimate that about half of all undocumented workers pay federal income taxes, if not more. So in a year when Trump does not pay federal income taxes, which has been the case in the past, undocumented immigrants who do federal pay income taxes would pay more than him.\nBut Clinton makes it seem as if this is a present state, and we don\u2019t know anything about Trump\u2019s current tax situation because he has not made his tax returns public. For that reason, we have no way of comparing Trump\u2019s federal income tax payments to those of any given undocumented immigrant.\nWe rate Clinton\u2019s claim Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04039"}
