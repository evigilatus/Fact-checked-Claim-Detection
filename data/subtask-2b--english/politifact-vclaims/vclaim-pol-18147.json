Lord Dunmore\u2019s orders happen to be some of them.\u00a0\n\n\nDunmore, Virginia\u2019s royal governor at the time of war, recently had his chance at the limelight when he was compared with Virginia's current Democratic governor, Ralph Northam, on the issue of gun control\n\n\nState Sen. Eric Burlison, R-Springfield, tweeted: \"Anyone who knows Virginia history can see the comparison with Lord Dunmore and @GovernorVA Ralph Northam. Remember, the American Revolution began when they came for the guns. #2ndAmendment\"\n\n\nBurlison tweeted this the\u00a0day of a gun rally in Virginia.\u00a0\n\n\nMore than 22,000 people rallied outside the state Capitol on Jan. 20\u00a0in protest of gun control legislation Northam supported. Northam supported a bill that called for the ban of certain assault rifles, but it failed in the state Senate on Feb. 17. Other bills, ranging from giving local Virginian governments more ability to ban concealed carry in public places to reporting stolen guns, passed on Feb. 28.\n\n\nWe reached out to Burlison\u2019s office. His staff said that the senator did not mean to imply that Dunmore caused the Revolution, so we\u2019re concentrating here on the sentence about guns. They also cited a\u00a0History.com\u00a0article\u00a0as a summary of the war.\u00a0\n\n\nBurlison\u2019s tweet seems to simplify an entire revolution. So, we dusted off the history textbooks. Here\u2019s what we found.\u00a0\n\n\nWhat happened\n\n\nThis tweet was meant to call back on American history and use it as a cautionary tale \u2014 except the tale was taken out of context.\u00a0\n\n\nThe first battles of the Revolution were on April 19, 1775, at Lexington and Concord in Massachusetts. The town was alerted before the British arrived. Minutemen stood waiting for them \u2014 a shot rang out and the scene became violent.\n\n\nWe know a few things for sure:\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nGen.Thomas Gage sent Lt. Colonel Smith to lead the British troops to Concord.\u00a0\n\n\nGage received a tip that colonial soldiers in Concord were gathering arms.\u00a0\n\n\nThe British troops were ordered to destroy gunpowder and arrest the colonial rebels John Hancock and Samuel Adams.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nWhat else were the troops after? While one said arms weren't targeted, another said that guns would've been part of the order to confiscate the armory at Concord.\n\n\nA third, University of Missouri history professor John L. Bullion, showed us the written orders.\u00a0In a letter from Gage to Smith, Gage orders the destruction of guns \u2014 and ammunition, flour, tents, pork or beef, carriages and more.\u00a0\nBut there were more politics in play.\n\n\nWho was Dunmore, anyway?\u00a0\n\n\nWe should probably take a look at Lord Dunmore. After all, Burlison mentions him in the first half of the tweet.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 22, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden \u201chas issued more executive fiats than anyone in such a short period of time, ever, more than Obama, more than Trump, more than anyone.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLord Dunmore, also known as John Murray, was the last royal governor of Virginia. As tensions grew, Dunmore called for the removal of gunpowder stored in local magazines.\u00a0\n\n\nDunmore was then pressured by the hundreds of countrymen that stormed Williamsburg to either return or pay for the lost gunpowder. Dunmore ended up having to pay 330 pounds (or about $56,000 in today\u2019s dollars).\u00a0\n\n\nHe became very unpopular and was chased out of his home. Dunmore and his family then had to stay on the British ship\u00a0Fowley.\u00a0\n\n\nHowever, Dunmore is probably better known for his later 1775 proclamation. It announced that a revolution was underfoot and offered freedom to enslaved people if they fought for the British.\u00a0\n\n\n...And taxes?\n\n\nWIth politics, money usually becomes an issue at one point. That goes for what leads up to the revolution, too.\u00a0\n\n\nBritain won the French and Indian War, but the fighting wasn\u2019t cheap. The 1764 Currency Act said the colonies couldn\u2019t print their own money, but what caused the biggest uproar was the Stamp Act of the next year. The tax was on all printed paper \u2014 including newspapers, legal documents and more.\u00a0\n\n\nThat kicked off a building frustration for colonists over taxes without representation in the British Parliament. That\u2019s not all, though \u2014 more acts were added that taxed more products. More soldiers occupied colonists\u2019 homes.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd the British Parliament made clear it could make whatever laws it liked.\n\n\nThings got worse when five colonists died in the Boston Massacre.\n\n\nSoldiers were convicted of lesser crimes, but not murder. Samuel Adams created committees of correspondence to spread the news about the massacre in 1772.\u00a0\n\n\nThe following year, some Sons of Liberty members snuck on a tea ship in Boston Harbor. They dumped the tea overboard to protest a monopoly given to the East India Tea Company. Britain retaliated. However, colonists encouraged boycotts, and New England began preparing for war.\n\n\nIn 1775, British soldiers attempted to take some ammunition but were turned away. Later, word got out to the British that the growing rebellion might be storing military supplies in Concord.\u00a0\n\n\nOne day after the first battles, Lord Dunmore made an order to get rid of gunpowder.\n\n\nThe rest is (literally) history.\u00a0\n\n\nOur ruling\u00a0\n\n\nBurlison tweeted that \"the American Revolution began when they came for the guns.\"\u00a0\n\n\nHis tweet was a dramatic simplification of history There were many factors at play that sparked the American Revolution. It was caused by a lack of economic freedom and representation in the government and more.\u00a0\n\n\nThat said, arms may have been one of many factors in the invasion of Lexington and Concord.\u00a0\n\n\nWe rate this statement as Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18147"}
