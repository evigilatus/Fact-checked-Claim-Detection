Pittenger is \"constantly rated as one of the most liberal Republicans in Congress.\"", "truth_label": "false", "date": "stated on February 9, 2018 in a newsletter:", "title": "Is Robert Pittenger among the 'most liberal' Republican congressmen?", "text": "Rev. Mark Harris came within 134 votes of beating U.S. Rep. Robert Pittenger two years ago in the Republican primary for his seat, so he\u2019s trying again this year.\nAnd to close the voting gap before the May 8 primary, Harris is questioning Pittenger\u2019s conservative credentials.\nPittenger has represented North Carolina\u2019s 9th Congressional District since 2013, when he succeeded retiring Republican Sue Myrick. A Charlotte resident, Pittenger previously served in the state Senate and in 2008 ran unsuccessfully for Lt. Governor.\nIn a recent newsletter, Harris criticized Pittenger for supporting a spending bill that raised the debt ceiling.\n\"Robert Pittenger showed us yet again why he is constantly rated as one of the most liberal Republicans in Congress,\" the newsletter says.\nThere are 535 voting members of Congress (the House of Representatives and the Senate). Republicans control Congress with nearly 300 seats: 238 in the House and 51 seats in the Senate.\nThe term \"most liberal\" is somewhat subjective. But PolitiFact wondered whether conservative watchdog groups have consistently singled out Pittenger as liberal since he won North Carolina\u2019s 9th Congressional district in 2013.\nWe reached out to the Harris campaign to see what ratings systems he\u2019s referencing in the newsletter.\nWhat Harris said\nThe primary source for the statement is a rating by Conservative Review, according to Harris campaign spokesman Andy Yates. Conservative Review is a website founded by Mark Levin, a controversial radio personality who has referred to Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell as a \"dummy\" and \"failure.\"\n\"Pittenger has a 55% F grade with them. It is the second worst grade of any NC Republican House member (McHenry is the worst),\" Yates said in an email, referring to Rep. Patrick McHenry, who represents NC\u2019s 10th Congressional district. \"Pittenger has consistently graded out as an F with this group which marks him as one of the most liberal Republicans in Congress.\"\nYates is right about Pittenger\u2019s standing among the 10 other North Carolina Republicans in the House. Whether that puts him among the most liberal Republicans depends on how one defines \"most liberal.\"\nAccording to Conservative Review\u2019s scorecard, there are about 90 House Republicans \u2013 about 36 percent \u2013 who have lower \"Liberty Scores\" than Pittenger. Among those with lower scores than Pittenger: House Speaker Paul Ryan and majority whip Steve Scalise.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJenna Wadsworth\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth Carolina Secretary of State Elaine Marshall \"has won more statewide races than probably anyone else alive.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Paul Specht \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYates also cited Pittenger\u2019s 2018 rating with FreedomWorks, which is zero. FreedomWorks is a libertarian-leaning advocacy group. The scorecard mostly covers fiscal policy, civil liberties and regulatory issues, said Jason Pye, vice president of legislative affairs at FreedomWorks.\nPye referred to Pittenger as \"unreliable\" when it comes to reining in spending. Pittenger \"generally votes with leadership, and they like to bust spending caps and bust the budget \u2014 things we\u2019re opposed to,\" Pye said.\nPittenger has a \"Lifetime Score\" of 70 with the FreedomWorks. There are about 114 House members with lower lifetime scores than Pittenger. Pittenger\u2019s score places him slightly to the right of California Republican Devin Nunes and slightly to the left of U.S. Sen. Richard Burr, also of North Carolina.\nPittenger\u2019s lifetime ratings on FreedomWorks or Conservative Review aren\u2019t extremely liberal (or conservative.) To get a full picture of Pittenger\u2019s record, we consulted other sources as well.\nWhat others said\nPittenger votes out-of-step with the majority of Republicans 5.5 percent of the time, according to ProPublica. The group says that\u2019s close to the average for Republicans in Congress.\nHe has a score of 90 percent with Heritage Action for America, a watchdog group and think tank that says it \"turns conservative ideas into reality on Capitol Hill.\" The average score for House Republicans is 68 percent.\nAccording to a vote tracker on FiveThirtyEight.com, Pittenger\u2019s votes are aligned with Trump 96.9 percent of the time. And there are dozens of Republican House members who vote in-step with Trump less than Pittenger.\nHe has a perfect score with FRC Action, which advocates for conservative social issues. As of 2016, Pittenger also had an 88 lifetime rating with The American Conservative Union, another leading conservative organization. The Club For Growth, which tracks legislation that affects the economy, gives Pittenger a lifetime score of 79 percent \u2013 which is in the middle-of-the-road for House Republicans.\nVoteView.com, meanwhile, says Pittenger is more conservative than 68 percent of Republicans in the House.\nIt would be one thing if Harris said Pittenger isn't taking a strong enough stance on fiscal issues, even if it means voting against the party. Harris could make a case there.\nBut, \"to make the assertion that Pittenger is one of the most liberal Republicans is a stretch too far,\" said Michael Bitzer, chair of the politics department at Catawba College in Salisbury, NC.\nOur ruling\nHarris said Pittenger is \"constantly rated as one of the most liberal Republicans in Congress.\" We can\u2019t find the results to back that up. So we rate this claim False.\n Share the Facts 2018-03-15 13:07:53 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  Rep.
