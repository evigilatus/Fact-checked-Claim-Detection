Cavuto pressed Keely Mullen with the Million Student March on how she would pay for a program to make public college tuition-free, forgive all current college debt and pay college students $15 an hour.\n\"If you wanted all that stuff, someone has to pick up the tab,\" Cavuto asked on his Nov. 12 show. \"Who would that be?\"\n\"The 1 percent of society that are hoarding all the wealth and causing a catastrophe that students are facing,\" Mullen answered.\nCavuto pushed back and presented Mullen with this scenario to demonstrate the limits of getting the wealthy to pony up.\n\"They\u2019ve done studies on this, Keely,\" Cavuto said. \"I don\u2019t want to get boring here. But even if you were to take the 1 percent, and take all of their money, tax it 100 percent. Do you know it wouldn\u2019t keep Medicare -- just Medicare -- going for three years? \"\nSeveral readers asked us to check Cavuto\u2019s basic math. Could the wealthiest 1 percent pay for Medicare for three years or not?\nWe don\u2019t want to get boring either, but reader be warned: Numbers, multiplication and subtraction lie ahead.\nWe asked the Fox Business Network for studies backing up Cavuto\u2019s math. \nThe Fox press office didn\u2019t point us to any studies. Instead, a spokeswoman explained that Cavuto and his producer averaged the yearly income going to the top 1 percent as reported by the Internal Revenue Service for 2011, 2012 and 2013. They came up with \"about $1.75 trillion.\"\nFor the cost of Medicare, they went to two sources: The Kaiser Family Foundation, which we\u2019ll get to in a moment, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services web page on national health expenditures for 2013. That page gave them the figure of $585.7 billion of Medicare expenditures.\nThey multiplied the Medicare number by three and found that it would be $1.755 trillion over three years. The correct number is actually $1.757 trillion, but the point remains the same. Using Cavuto\u2019s estimate, three years of Medicare spending is more than all the money the top 1 percent took in.\nWe tried to repeat Cavuto\u2019s analysis and ran into some issues.\nProblems with the Medicare dollars\nCavuto\u2019s Medicare spending number is not bulletproof. There are credible, lower figures.\nMedicare spending is reported in two ways: Gross outlays and net outlays. Gross outlays are basically money out the door, and net outlays reduces the total based on the money Medicare takes in apart from the federal budget and the payroll tax.\nWe found a discrepancy in the gross outlay number. While the CMS fact sheet does report $585.7 billion in gross spending, the Medicare Trustees, the program\u2019s overseers, reported a slightly lower $582.9 billion for 2013. Since that comes from the Trustees' official report to Congress, we gave it some weight. (The difference is due to accounting rules.)\nWe also found that the other source cited by Fox Business, the Kaiser Family Foundation, which is widely seen as a neutral source of health care data, focuses on the net outlays, not the gross spending.\nFox Business directed us to the foundation\u2019s Medicare fact-sheet. That page reports the net figure, which factors in billions of dollars of premiums paid by Medicare users, along with recaptured inappropriate payments to providers. \u00a0\nFor 2013, Kaiser reported net spending of $492 billion. Juliette Cubanski, a top Medicare analyst at Kaiser, explained that the net amount does a better job of capturing the burden on taxpayers as a whole.\n\"Showing the gross spending amount would, in a way, overstate federal spending on Medicare because some of that amount comes back to the Treasury in the form of premiums,\" Cubanski said.\nSo the Medicare Trustees provided a slightly lower number than Cavuto used, and his other source provided a significantly lower number. Both measures put his math at risk.\nProblems with the top 1 percent dollars\nCavuto used IRS data for 2011, 2012 and 2013. It\u2019s easy to find the IRS analysis of the Adjusted Gross Income, or AGI, for the top 1 percent for 2011 and 2012. But the official analysis only comes out about three years after the fact, and the 2013 numbers are not available.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo where did Cavuto get an estimate for 2013 income? His staff said he used an IRS spreadsheet for 2013. However, this only gives you a rough approximation, and when we compared past spreadsheets to the official analyses for 2011 and 2012, we found significant differences.\nNonetheless, there is another issue with Cavuto\u2019s income figure. Adjusted Gross Income misses a fair chunk of the money people actually make. There are many deductions in taxable income that come before taxpayers reaches that point in their tax returns. One of the largest takes the form of tax-free contributions to a retirement account.\nIn a perfect world, one would be able to say precisely the actual incomes, before any deductions, of the top 1 percent.\nIn practice, that turns out to be a tricky business, said Daniel Feenberg, a tax expert at the National Bureau of Economic Research.\n\"There are many ways to do this calculation, including many that are correct but differ from each other,\" Feenberg said.\nThe Tax Policy Center, a joint effort of the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute, has a method to estimate what it calls the \"cash income\" of tax filers. Its model adds back in the dollars put into a retirement account, along with non-taxable Social Security and pension income, and various other pots of money.\nAveraging the center\u2019s estimates of cash income for the top 1 percent for 2011, 2012 and 2013 produces a total of $1.85 trillion. That\u2019s about $100 billion more than Cavuto\u2019s estimate for the top 1 percent.\nThe center\u2019s co-director William Gale warned us that using tax returns to measure income totally misses a major source of income for the top 1 percent: gains on financial holdings that accrue but aren\u2019t cashed out.\n\"When Warren Buffett\u2019s stocks go up up by X billion over a year, none of that shows up in his AGI unless he sells some of the assets,\" Gale said.\nSetting aside the huge policy debate involved here, measuring income in any given year is a particularly poor yardstick for the financial capacity of the top 1 percent. Way more than most people, they get to decide when to turn their wealth into income.\nRunning the numbers\nFor the last step of this fact-check, we stress-tested Cavuto\u2019s assertion. The math is simple: You triple a given Medicare spending number and subtract that\u00a0from an income estimate.\nWe did the math using three different amounts for Medicare spending and three different estimates of the income of the top 1 percent.\nFor the IRS, we use the most recent available AGI figure from 2012. (We know that due to efforts to avoid higher capital gains taxes, many people sold assets in 2012. This artificially raised the AGI figure that year, but we\u2019ve yet to find a report that shows the size of that effect in terms of the income of the top 1 percent.)\nWith that caveat, here is the table -- using all the sources above -- showing what you\u2019re left with when you take one year of income for the 1 percent and subtract the three-year cost of Medicare. A negative number means the Medicare total was more than the income -- \u00a0as Cavuto said.\nThe green background is where Cavuto is correct. The red is where he is not. The amounts are in billions of dollars.\n\nThere\u2019s only one outcome that supports Cavuto\u2019s assertion that the income of the 1 percent wouldn\u2019t pay for three years of Medicare spending \u2014 the one that uses his own sources. The remaining eight scenarios based on other reputable sources show the income of the 1 percent exceeding three years of Medicare spending, ranging from a difference of $1.3 billion to $504 billion.\nCavuto\u2019s method is very sensitive to small shifts in the numbers. Even using his income estimate but relying on the gross spending figure from the Medicare Trustees, he missed the mark. Not by much, but his assertion is still not right.\nThe gap only gets wider if you use any other estimate of income and any other Medicare spending amount.\nIf you use the Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s number for Medicare ($492 billion) and the the Tax Policy Center\u2019s number for income ($1.85 trillion), the money from the wealthiest 1 percent would cover Medicare for about three years and nine months.\nOur ruling\nCavuto said that one year of the income of the top 1 percent would not pay for three years of Medicare. His point was that the financial capacity of the top 1 percent is not unlimited.\nHe bolstered his point with a definitive statement, but the underlying math is flawed.\nCavuto used the highest number we could find for the cost of Medicare. While he may have relied on an official web page for his Medicare number, we found an equally official source, the Medicare Trustees, that reported a lower figure. That small difference in itself made his claim incorrect. Other measures of Medicare spending made it even more incorrect.\nHis income figure, based on an approach he never fully described, is guaranteed to undercount the actual income of the top 1 percent.\nThere is a sliver of accuracy in his calculation, but the weight of the numbers goes against him.\nWe rate this claim Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05705"}
