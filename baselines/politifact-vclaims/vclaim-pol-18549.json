AARP is a nonpartisan organization that doesn\u2019t endorse political candidates.\u00a0\nJason Young, an AARP spokesperson, told us that the other allegation in this Facebook post is wrong, too.\n\"Since the early days of the pandemic, AARP has warned policymakers on all sides that rationing care based on age or disability is discriminatory,\" Young said in an email. \"Older people are not political pawns or less worthy to receive care or a vaccine than anyone else.\"\nPress releases and news coverage in recent months support this.\u00a0\nA March 31 press release from AARP titled \"AARP statement against rationing in the distribution of and access to health care\" quotes Nancy LeaMond, the organization's executive vice president.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMasks have negative impacts on 68% of children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jon Greenberg \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Using age or disability to categorically exclude people from accessing treatment would be discriminatory and AARP opposes it,\" she said.\u00a0\u00a0\nAn April 9 Wall Street Journal article about state plans to possibly ration ventilators as health care facilities were overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients reported that AARP called for federal policies to protect the elderly and other vulnerable groups from rationing.\u00a0\nThe Washington Post reported that AARP \"decried age cutoffs for ventilator access in some plans.\"\nOn April 24, AARP sent a letter to the director of the civil rights office at the Department of Health and Human Services.\u00a0\n\"It is imperative that those entrusted with deciding who gets access to healthcare do not discriminate,\" the letter said. \"Using age or disability status to categorically exclude people from accessing treatment violates existing federal law and we join you in strongly opposing such discrimination.\"\nBiden,\u00a0who was elected president at age 77, did form a coronavirus advisory board that includes Dr. Atul Gawande, a senior adviser in Health and Human Services during the Clinton administration, Michael Osterholm, an epidemiologist who was an adviser to the agency\u2019s secretary and Ezekiel Emanuel, an Obama administration health policy advisor who in 2014 wrote an essay about reducing medical interventions by choice in old age. But the purpose of the board is to prevent COVID-19 spread, particularly among those most at risk, including the eldery. There is no evidence it advocates the notion that life after 75 isn\u2019t worth living.\nOur ruling\nA post on Facebook claims that \"AARP endorsed Biden\" and \"says if you are past 75 you should just die and go away.\" AARP didn\u2019t endorse Biden, or anyone. And the organization, which represents millions of Americans age 50 and older, has aggressively lobbied against any health care policies that would discriminate against aging populations.\nWe rate these claims about AARP Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18549"}
