The clip is cut off", "text": "A clip of Vice President Mike Pence helping deliver personal protective equipment to a Virginia nursing home started circulating on social media after late night host Jimmy Kimmel featured it in his show.\u00a0\nA 40-second clip of the \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" episode shared on Twitter shows Kimmel mocking Pence, saying he was caught on a hot mic apparently joking about carrying empty boxes.\n\"Here he is with no mask on, wheeling PPE\u2019s into a health care center and doing his best to lift them. What a hero,\" Kimmel says, \"and since it was going so well, and also because he didn\u2019t realize he had a mic on, Magic Mike decided to keep it going. Listen in closely here.\"\nKimmel cuts back to Pence. Audio picks up one of the workers telling the vice president that the rest of the boxes in the van are empty. Pence can be heard responding, \"Can I carry the empty ones? Just for the camera?\"\u00a0\nThe video ends, and Kimmel says, \"Mike Pence pretending to carry empty boxes of PPEs into a hospital is the perfect metaphor for who he is and what he's doing: A big box of nothing delivering another box of nothing.\"\nMike Pence caught on hot mic delivering empty boxes of PPE for a PR stunt. pic.twitter.com/IduvGhiPwj\u2014 Matt McDermott (@mattmfm) May 8, 2020 \nBefore deleting it, the Occupy Democrats group re-shared the clip on Facebook with the headline: \"OMG: Mike Pence caught on hot mix \"delivering\" EMPTY boxes of PPE to hospital... and PRETENDING THEY ARE HEAVY!\"\u00a0 Other websites quickly followed suit.\nBut the video is deceptively edited. The Kimmel clip cuts the video off at a selective point, just before Pence shuts the door to the van. Pence doesn\u2019t touch or pretend to lift any empty boxes.\nThe clip was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.
