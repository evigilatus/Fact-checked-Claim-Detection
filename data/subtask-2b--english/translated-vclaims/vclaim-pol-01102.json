In an effort to end the closure of the Government, Trump offered to continue providing temporary protection for 700,000 dreams for $5.7 billion for a border wall. Scott invited the democratic leaders in Congress to accept his offer, but they rejected it. \"Children should never be punished for the actions of their parents,\" Scott Jan 19, \"and I have always supported the protection of our parents.\" Children should never be punished for the actions of their parents, and they have always supported the protection of our parents. And now it's time for the Democrats to decide whether they want to negotiate in good faith and accept a compromise that guarantees our borders... (*Sen RickScott) 19 January 2019, Scott did not ease his position on illegal immigration during his eight years as Governor of Florida. But his support for their cause wasn't always there. We do not judge whether Scott's change of attitude on migration, including dreamers, was a sound policy, but whether his words about his own record were accurate. It should be noted that in Florida, there was considerable support among some prominent Republican politicians - including members of Congress - to help dreams. Scott's last position is more in line with this perspective. In the early years, at the beginning of his tenure, Scott opposed the protection of an undocumented immigrant, including dreams. A few Twitter users responded to Scott's tweet with a compass to a statement made by Scott on Darmers in 2010, a few weeks before he was sworn in. hours before the United States House of Representatives voted to approve the Law of Dreams, Scott said he was opposed to legislation. \"I'm against the Law of Dreams,\" Scott December 8, 2010, said during a tour of Miami Harbor. \"Why? I don't believe in forgiveness.\" The bill would have provided a conditional access to citizenship for hundreds of thousands of undocumented migrants. The bill approved the House of Representatives, but then he died in the United States Senate. Three Cuban-American Republican legislators in Miami, namely the Republic of Lincoln, Mario D\u00edaz-Balart and Eliana Ross-Lehtinin, joined the Democrats in voting in favour of the bill. At that time, Scott &apos; s comment was consistent with the approach of his main Republican campaign against illegal migration. Scott promised to adopt a similar law to the controversial law of Arizona SB1070, which requires immigrants to show their citizenship papers if they are suspended by law enforcement, among other situations. Once he was elected governor, Scott stopped talking about that promise. In June 2012, Obama announced the deferred work for the arrival of children, or CCDA, the extension of the executive branch to postpone the deportation of dreamers who meet certain criteria on a renewable two-year basis. On February 1, 2021, Tom Cotton mentioned in an interview with Fox and friends \"Many of these arriving immigrants, we have no way of checking their background for either health or security.\" \u2022 On 3 February 2021, in 2013, Scott rejected a bill to allow dreamers to obtain driver &apos; s licences. Among other reasons, Scott CADA criticized the \"unfavourable direction of Congress\" policy in his message as the veto. In the same month that Scott rejected the bill, the United States Senate was moving towards voting on a bill to change immigration laws, including a way of citizenship. The bill was written by a group of party senators, including Marco Rubio, Republic of Florida. While some prominent Republicans in Florida publicly approved the bill, Scott's response was more optimistic. When the Tampa Bay Times asked him on 13 June 2013 whether he supported the bill, Scott would not abide by either but commended the border security part of the bill. \"I think Senator Rubio has done a really great job, focusing on the debate, to make sure that we have a successful immigration policy. I'm glad he's really focused on securing our borders and having a policy that we all understand, \"Scott said. When asked again in July 2013 - two weeks after its adoption in the Senate - the bill was described as \"the right thing\" and referred to border security repeatedly, but nothing on the road to citizenship. When Scott changed office while seeking his re-election in 2014, Scott took a more positive approach: he signed the bill, which easily approved the legislative authority to provide education for dreams in the United States. \"Students who spent their childhood here in Florida deserve the same education in the states,\" he said. This was a complete prank from 2011 when he said, \"With regard to education in the state for illegal immigrants, I totally oppose it.\" In September 2017, the Trump Administration announced that it would phase out the ODA agency. (Renovations are now in place, after no action has been taken by the United States Supreme Court.) In response to the planned phasing out, Scott called on Congress to work and help dreams. \"I don't like to punish children for their parents' actions,\" Scott said in September 1, 2017. \"These children must be allowed to pursue the American dream, and Congress must act immediately.\" Scott was very direct in his support for the Dreamers during his 2018 successful presentation to the U.S. Senate. In an article from the United States of America Today, Scott said that Congress must \"secure the status of arrivals\" and \"do the right thing for these children to remove the uncertainty surrounding their future goals and dreams.\" Since the then United States Republic of America, Carlos Corbello, R-Fla, was attempting to impose a vote on immigration in June 2018, Congressional silence once again called for \"completion of DAC legislation.\" We asked the press office Scott if he had evidence that he was \"always\" supporting the protection of dreamers. Sarah Sheurian referred to the American opinion of Scott today and the signing of the Education Bill in the United States. She said, \"Rick Scott was an open opponent of illegal immigration, but he clearly supported a legal path for children who were brought here without fault.\" Our rule, Scott, said, \"I have always supported the protection of our farmers.\" In 2010, Scott said, \"I'm against dream law,\" and the legislation called \"excuse me.\" In 2013, Obama criticized the deferred dream work programme, saying that Obama had passed Congress. A bill to grant driving permits to dreams has also been rejected. Scott has reduced his attitude in recent years, and politicians are allowed to change. But it doesn't match what really happened. We're assessing his statement wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01102"}
