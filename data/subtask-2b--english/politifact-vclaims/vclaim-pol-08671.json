Warshauer opposes the aquarium plan, but said the mailer\u2019s cut-and-dried claim is inaccurate.\n\n\"Obviously, the city will go on funding neighborhoods,\" he said.\n\nClearwater Marine Aquarium officials have said they intend to ask for city funds from two sources if the plan to build the aquarium advances: the city parking fund and a portion of taxes raised in the downtown Community Redevelopment Area.\n\nThe city parking fund isn\u2019t typically used for neighborhood projects, which are things such as parks, recreation facilities, traffic calming and community policing. The city uses the parking fund for parking projects and Clearwater Beach lifeguards. The city is planning to use parking fund money to build a downtown parking garage \u2014 a project which presumably would benefit the downtown neighborhood.\n\nWhat about the aquarium\u2019s potential use of property taxes raised in the downtown CRA? Would that mean \"No future funding for our neighborhoods\"?\n\nThe money the aquarium wants would come from the annual tax increment raised in the district. The tax increment is new tax revenue collected if property values rise after the date the district is established. This year, that was $1.7 million in the downtown Clearwater district.\n\nCMA plans to ask the city for half of that increment revenue for 20 years, but would need the agreement of city and county officials.\n\nBy state law, that money can\u2019t be spent outside the boundaries of the district, which are roughly Drew Street on the north, the waterfront to the west, Chestnut Street to the south and Highland Avenue to the east. So Countryside, Island Estates, Sand Key, Morningside Estates or any other neighborhood outside the district wouldn\u2019t be eligible for that money anyway.\n\nBut Warshauer says a broader argument about the proposed aquarium\u2019s financial impact on neighborhoods has some validity.\n\n\"There is an unknown factor here. How much money is going to be spent on traffic impact if this aquarium is built and if it is successful?\" Warshauer said.\n\nCMA officials contend that a successful aquarium will increase property values downtown, therefore pouring more tax increment revenue into city coffers and helping to pay for any infrastructure improvements downtown necessitated by a successful tourist attraction.\n\nTina Wilson, the city\u2019s budget director, said the city has $1.8 million budgeted for street resurfacing citywide. If streets needed to be improved because so many people were drawn to the aquarium, the costs could be paid for out of the resurfacing fund, any available tax increment revenue, or a variety of other funds, including reserves, the Penny for Pinellas sales tax or the general fund. But the city hasn\u2019t discussed options yet, Wilson said.\n\nNo one, including referendum opponents, has a crystal ball to predict what the city will spend in future years for neighborhood projects or for downtown improvements.\n\nBut since the aquarium plan is to seek only half of the increment revenue, and only for 20 years, the remaining half of that revenue would theoretically remain available for projects benefitting the downtown neighborhood.\n\nAnd use of those dollars downtown wouldn\u2019t hurt other neighborhoods in the city, since those dollars can\u2019t legally be spent elsewhere.\n\nThere is no proof that approval of Tuesday\u2019s referendum \u2014 which would only authorize the city to negotiate a lease and doesn\u2019t ensure construction of the aquarium \u2014 will mean no future funding for Clearwater neighborhoods. The opponents\u2019 statement is based on speculation, with no foundation in fact.\n\nWe rate it False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDick Greco\n\n\nstated on May 1, 2002 in city report reprinted as 2011 mayoral campaign material\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Financed the largest parking expansion program without a rate increase.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Richard Danielson \u2022 February 12, 2011", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08671"}
