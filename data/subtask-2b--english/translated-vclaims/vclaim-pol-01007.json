Vermont has joined a number of states in reviewing their abortion laws since the appointment of Judge Brett Cavanaugh to the Supreme Court, creating a conservative majority that advocates of abortion rights fear would jeopardize the historic decision of Roe v. Wade. Christopher Quinn, Bishop of the Roman Catholic parish of Parlington, did not join a public hearing in H.57, a bill that states that his supporters codify the current abortion in law, saying that his moral authority in the state house has been undermined by scandals of the abuse of priests. However, the Bishop made it clear that he was strongly opposed to the law and spoke to the parishes during a public hearing on 6 February. \"We're talking about a law that would allow an abortion of a child until the moment of birth,\" Quinn said about the proposed bill during that meeting. \"He's taking us to a place where we literally kill children.\" While the Governor of the Republic, Vermont, said that he supported women &apos; s right to choose, he refused to weigh the bill as the conservative opposition continued. According to defenders of abortion rights, the law simply establishes the existing practice in the law. Those who oppose abortion say that legislation will allow mothers and doctors to terminate the pregnancy at any time until the birth. Can both sides be right? We decided to check the facts. In response to a question about his position on the law, Quinn referred to article 9497, which prohibits public entities from restricting abortion. \"This section prohibits (makes illegal) any restrictions on a woman's right to abortion. There are no such restrictions in the Bill, but they would include any restrictions on the age of pregnancy of the unborn child.\" Books in e-mail. \"The Bill therefore codifyes a woman's right to abortion at any time during pregnancy, for whatever reason or without it, until full birth.\" This is true, if medical professionals do not adhere to their policies and ethical practices. However, it is not a change from the current legal restrictions - or lack of them altogether - on abortion in Vermont. In January 27, Bryn Harry, the legislative lawyer working on the abortion bill, sent a memorandum describing the existing laws in Vermont on abortion, and how the proposed law would affect access and current practices. \"In Vermont, there is an unrestricted legal right to obtain abortion regardless of age or marital status,\" written. \"There is no requirement that a person notify or obtain permission from a parent, guardian or spouse prior to an abortion.\" The Vermont Medical Association testified before the H.57 Humanitarian Services Commission earlier this month. The Vermont Act is now silent on abortion and allows unrestricted abortion. However, in 2016, the latest year for which abortion data are available, \"91.7 per cent of all abortions in Vermont occurred during the first three months (12 weeks or less) and only 1.3 per cent of abortions in Vermont occurred in 2016 after 21 weeks.\" Data from the Centers for Disease Control on national abortions in 2015 indicate that seven abortions were performed in Vermont after 21 weeks - 0.7 per cent of all abortions in the state - but do not give more specific details as to when these procedures will be performed. The Medical Association added that women simply did not choose to terminate pregnancy in the last few months, as suggested by opponents of H.57, such as Quinn. Mitt Romney stated on 26 April 2007 in Stratham, N.H., \" (Makin) that he was opposed to dropping Roe v. Wade's case. Now it's for the heart of Ro v. Wade.\" Angie Drobnik Hollan, August 23, 2007, \"Long-term abortion is a social construction introduced to create an image of voluntary abortion occurring close to 8-9 months, which does not happen and is not a medical term,\" says the community. Even if a woman wants to have an abortion at that late hour, there are no suppliers doing so in Vermont, according to the medical community. \"No abortion service provider in Vermont will perform voluntary abortions in the third quarter of the year,\" she says. Lucy Lerich, Vice-President of Family Planning Policy in North New England, said the only time a woman could get an abortion was that she would be delayed in pregnancy \"under conditions that are really harsh for the mother's health or because the pregnancy is at risk.\" Doctors who were already implementing optional procedures that would encounter serious professional consequences late in pregnancy for violating their licences and committing medical malpractice. Therefore, abortions in the third quarter are extremely rare and do not occur as optional measures, but are they legal, as Quinn says? Because Vermont has no legal restrictions on abortion at all, this is the current question about federal laws and Supreme Court decisions, and how they apply in Vermont. Herr, Legislative Counsel, explores this in her note to legislators. Roe v. Wade did two major things, written, saying that states could not regulate abortion in the first three months and states could regulate abortion later in pregnancy. The Supreme Court has since repealed state laws restricting abortion if it is found to place an \"undue burden\" on women seeking abortion. The Federal Law on the Prohibition of Partial Abortion, approved in 2003, prohibits caregivers from performing a procedure which he describes as \"an abortion in which the person performing the abortion will, intentionally and intentionally, give birth to a live embryo until the whole of the fetus, if the head is first presented, outside the mother's body, or if the breast is presented, any part of the fetus's stem is behind the bed outside the mother's body.\" The law currently before the legislators in Vermont will not permit such proceedings. Harry wrote: \"In the case of a carer in Vermont knowingly 'a partial abortion' as defined by law in violation of that federal law, the carer may be prosecuted as provided by law, regardless of the provisions in H.57.\" However, as Quinn pointed out, \"partial abortion of childbirth\" does not describe all late abortions, and no one argues that abortion in medical emergencies is legal throughout pregnancy. The Catholic Church, which opposes all abortions, weighs in recent discussions in other states. A few weeks ago, politics questioned a viral image claiming that \"New York law makes it \"now fully legitimate to kill\" a child a minute before he was born.\" Catholic leaders in New York said that the law abolished \"all State restrictions on late action.\" The viral image received a \"false\" rating from politics because it \"simplifies and distorts what New York law allows.\" New York law contains a language that does not permit abortion after 24 weeks of pregnancy unless \"there is an absence of the safety of the foetus, or abortion is necessary to protect the life or health of the patient.\" Vermont's law has no such language. The statement of Governor Quinn is purely legal, but only if the law exists in a vacuum of practice and policy. Without context, this is very misleading as to what could be a permitted practice in Vermont. The proposed law will in no way alter the legal reality of Vermont. All the evidence suggests that the type of abortion that fears the bishop -- optional procedures in the final stages of pregnancy -- does not occur in Vermont, and will not occur if H.57 passes. We're assessing this allegation mostly wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01007"}
