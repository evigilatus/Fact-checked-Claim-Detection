Stalin led the communist nation from the 1920s until his death in 1953, and millions are believed to have died during his reign. The search for quotations does not appear in any history books, scientific works or primary sources. Social media are often aligned with the quote text along with Stalin's image. Our friends in Snoops looked at a similar quote and concluded that \"Stalin is very unlikely to speak these words.\" It seems doubtful that Stalin would say something like this, as quoted, in some sense, praise America for its strengths, Snoppes. We searched Stalin's online archives and an online library compiled by the University of Pennsylvania. Our search came out empty. It is unclear where this quote originated. The first use of the quote was Snoppes found in the 1983 letter to the editor of the Kansas newspaper. On January 13, 2021, the distinguished fact-checkers announced in a story in which General David H. Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request to use marines for security, and told her \"We're not working for you.\" Stalin could say this quote in a letter or in a letter that was never translated into English or placed on the Internet. But Carson's burden is to support his words with evidence. If new evidence appears to the contrary, we will reconsider this article. We contacted Carson's campaign, but we didn't answer it. We quote Carson that Stalin says, \"If you want to bring down America, you have to undermine three things: our spiritual lives, our patriotism, our morality.\" All the evidence suggests that this is a imaginary quote that was cut off online. We're assessing Carson's claim for fire pants.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05412"}
