But you do not have to be black to join Trinity. The church, which has been overwhelmed with media inquiries, said in a statement that it welcomes people of all races and has white members.\n\n\n\"There's no question (the e-mail) is a distortion,\" said Martin Marty, a retired Chicago-based historian of religion and public life, who is white and has attended services at Trinity several times.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.
