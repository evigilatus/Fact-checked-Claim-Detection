It's never happened before,\" Trump said March 21.\nIt is true that he won 66 counties (Sen. Marco Rubio won his birthplace of Miami-Dade before dropping out of the race), but Trump\u2019s nearly unanimous win is hardly unprecedented.\nWe looked at county-by-county election results from the state\u2019s Division of Elections website. Big wins aren\u2019t altogether unusual in Florida, if you go back just a few years.\nMitt Romney and Newt Gingrich split the state in the 2012 Republican primary, and both the GOP and Democrats split their primaries three ways in 2008.\nBut in 2004, Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry won all 67 counties for the Democrats.\nThat feat was repeated by both parties in 2000, when Vice President Al Gore won all 67 for the Democrats and Texas Gov. George W. Bush won all 67 for Republicans.\nIn 1996, Bob Dole took 66 of 67 counties for the GOP primary \u2014 but really, the 67th was a tie at 190 votes each for Dole and Pat Buchanan in Washington County.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBill Clinton took 63 counties in 1992\u2019s Democratic primary. Paul Tsongas won Alachua, Martin, Seminole and Palm Beach counties. Pat Buchanan mounted a primary challenge to incumbent president George H.W. Bush that year and won Hardee County. Bush nabbed the other 66.\nIn 1988, George H.W. Bush won 64 counties, losing three to Pat Robertson in the GOP race. Counties were split over their Democratic candidate, but Michael Dukakis won the state. Walter Mondale and Gary Hart divided the state for Democrats in 1984, with Jesse Jackson winning one county and John Glenn two. \u00a0\nThe state\u2019s online data only goes back to 1978, but there were enough examples to prove Trump wrong in this case.\nIn 1980, Jimmy Carter won 100 percent of Florida counties for the Democrats. But Trump can lay claim to beating the primary record of Republican hero Ronald Reagan.\nThe actor defeated his eventual vice presidential running mate George H.W. Bush by 64 counties to 3. In addition to Alachua County, Bush took Dixie and Union counties by a single vote.\nOur ruling\nTrump said, \"Out of 67 counties (in Florida), I won 66, which is unprecedented. It's never happened before.\"\nTrump won 66 counties, but it\u2019s far from unprecedented for Florida primary winners to win by a huge margin.
