It deals with abortion and birth control - frequently repeated in the campaign between the current democratic age of Mark Odal and the Republic of Korea Gardner. But the photos, the prosecution, make the announcement unusual. The ad shows footage of young men wearing partial clothes in bed, with a man trying to get condoms on the night table. \"You guys, you guys, you guys, you guys, you guys!\" The novel says. \"If Corey Gardner gets his way, you better store on condoms.\" In the dark letter, the ad offers a visual saying, \"Gardner: prohibition of birth control.\" The sponsors of the Declaration -- the NARAL Pro-Choice Groups of America and the NARAL Pro-Choice Colorado -- put the Declaration as a \"sexual\" attempt to reach young voters. (The Declaration also makes allegations about climate change, but we will not address those allegations in this verification process. How accurate is the allegation about condoms? We have already dealt with allegations about Gardner and birth control, but this is slightly different, so we will take a closer look. First, here's what the Gardner campaign said when we asked about the announcement. \"Core doesn't want to ban condoms,\" said the campaign spokesman Alex Ceciliano. \"In fact, he believes in increasing access to contraceptives. It has been suggested that common forms of oral contraception be made available on the table.\" So where does the ad get its evidence? Previous allegations about Gardner and birth control have emerged from his support for efforts to support \"personal\" measures that would determine the life that begins with the enrichment of the Colorado Constitution. In the U.S. House of Representatives, Gardner co-sponsored H.R. 1091, officially known as the Concept of Life Act and unofficially as the \"Personal\" Bill. The Bill was introduced on April 8, 2013 by Republic C Jordan, R-Ohio. According to the text of the draft law, \"the right to life of every human being born and born shall be equally protected\" and \"the right to life guaranteed by the Constitution shall be proclaimed as the right of every human being.\" He goes on to say that \"human\" and \"human\" include every member of the homosexual race at all stages of life, including the moment of inhalation, cloning or any other moment when a human being comes into existence.\" According to opponents of personal legislation, giving fertilized eggs all human rights can make many of the contraceptives approved by FDA illegal, such as pills, intrauterine devices or intrauterine contraceptives. The anti-abortion groups successfully petitioned for personal measures in the Colorado ballot in 2008 and 2010. On both occasions, more than 70 per cent of voters rejected it. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 January 11, 2012, as we have noted in the past, we cannot predict how the courts interpret personal legislation or its effects on legal birth control forms at present. Although Gardner recognizes that some contraceptive methods can be at risk if the personality passes, much legal ambiguity remains. Since no country has passed the personality measure, we do not know how it can affect certain types of contraceptives. As we have noted in previous articles on the discussion of personality, some legal scholars and the medical community have warned against its possible impact on access to birth control. The Gardner critics may have the point that some forms of birth control can be prohibited if personal measures become law - but this should not affect condoms. This is because condoms prevent sperm from reaching the egg in the first place. There has been no enrichment at all. In another development, Gardner showed great interest during the 2014 campaign, saying that he no longer supported personal mobility, partly because he now believed that it could affect access to certain forms of birth control. \"The fact that she's restricting contraception, it wasn't the right situation,\" said Gardner, the Denver Post. \"I've learned to listen. I don't understand everything properly the first time.\" Gardner also said that if the Affordable Care Act was not repealed, he wanted to allow the sale of contraceptive pills without prescription. The Odal campaign stated that it was in favour of allowing large-scale sale of contraceptive pills as long as insurance companies were still charged with covering these pills without any cost-sharing. Finally, the Gardner campaign indicates that in 2007 he was one of five persons who co-sponsored an abortion control measure in Colorado which states that \"Nothing in this section prohibits the sale, use, prescription or administration of a contraception measure, device, drug or chemical.\" This law, according to his campaign, indicates that Gardner is not an obstacle to passage. The sponsors of the announcement did not return to the Polite Fact, but Doug Gordon, a spokesman for NAral Pro-Chois Colorado, told our friends in Factcheck.org: \"We do not say that he prohibits condoms. We say that if Gardner starts to limit other forms of birth control, it is better to store condoms because there will be a lot of demand for them - since Gardner wants to ban other forms of birth control.\" While a satellite radio ad makes this argument, the television ad does not say so. It seems more reasonable to us that TV commercials assume that Gardner wants to ban birth control, period. Our ad judgment claims that if Corey Gardner gets his way, you better store the condoms. The most obvious explanation for this statement is that Gardner wants to ban condoms - which is based on an incorrect explanation of the measures that Gardner has supported in the past (which he has since distanced from). Gardner says he doesn't support the ban on condoms, and in any case, condoms will not be subject to dispute under the personal measure he once supported. We're assessing this allegation pants on fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07054"}
