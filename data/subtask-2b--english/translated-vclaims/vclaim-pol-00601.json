Buckers vs. Vikings. Badgers vs. Gophers. Soda v. Bob (Sooda). \"Cold tolerance is the best\"? - Nice people? More lakes? The new Minister of Tourism, Sarah Minnie, put her finger in the Lake conflict on May 9, 2019, as she appeared on \"The afternoon news in Wisconsin\" on Radio WTMJ. \"Wisconsin, many people may not be aware, actually has 15,000 freshwater lakes,\" she said. \"More than Minnesota?\" The host asked John Mercure. \"More than Minnesota,\" said Minnie. \"Sure. We won. We won.\" Minnesota is \"the land of 10,000 lakes,\" as state licence plates are announced. But Wisconsin isn't exactly a desert. While the people of both states are going to the nearest amount of water on the weekend of this commemorative day, we thought we were, well, diving into this one. Who's got more lakes? It's not an easy question. Our quest begins with the simplest version of this question. Wisconsin, how many lakes do you have? 15,074 says the Natural Resources Department of Wisconsin. Minnesota, how many lakes do you have? 11.842, says Minnesota Natural Resources. Congratulations, Wisconsin. Did you win? No. It's not that simple. What makes the lake? Let's start by figuring out what a lake is. Does the lake have to have a name? To be a certain measure? What if it's actually a flow? (What's the heck of a flow?) What about the intermittent lakes, which come and go in the season (instead of the lake all year round)? Minnesota defines the lake as a body of water greater than 10 acres. Thus, I obtained the figure of 11,482 in its public water supply. Wisconsin defined the lake as anything you feel like naming the lake. Thousands are less than 10 acres. Of the 15,074 \"documented lakes\" in the state, 60% do not even have a name. If we use the Lake Wisconsin database and apply the same 10-acre standard as Minnesota, Wisconsin has only 5,898 lakes. But the state databases have different listing criteria, so that alone does not settle our discussion. Peter Pollay, a climate scientist with DNR Minnesota, said that different agencies used different definitions of lakes for their own purposes, but there was no definition acceptable at the national level. In 1935, he literally wrote a book on lymnology, studying lakes and other freshwater bodies. Welch wrote that generally accepted definitions of lakes describe \"a corpse of permanent waters that is completely isolated from the sea and has an area of open water, relatively deep enough to produce somewhere on a barren beach and surf spots.\" However, he pointed out that the unique forms and make-up of the lake created problems for this definition and chose instead to define lakes by exclusion. Welch said the ponds are too small and too shallow from the living water where quiet water and the widespread occupation of high-water plants are common. Anything bigger, as he said, is a lake. On January 10, 2021, in a television interview, \"It takes a long time on election day to download those cards, which is why we have 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. to throw the ballot papers at Milwaukee.\" \u2022 January 15, 2012, at the same time, American geological areas do not formally define lakes. The National Hydrographic Data Set integrates lakes and pools into a single category. The Agency notes that at least 54 generic terms have similar characteristics to the lake. Examples include a basin, a pool, a tank and a flow (crowded water from the top of the dam). The selection of a consistent definition by the Mini office did not greatly assist the definition issue. When we arrived to look for support for the claim, Craig Trust's spokesman shared this via e-mail: \"Three undeniable facts: 1. Minnesota boasts more than 10,000 lakes. 2. Human rights and fundamental freedoms. 12 - 17 5 Wisconsin boasts more than 15,000 lakes. 3 - 15,000 more than 10,000.\" Of course, that brings us back to where we started. However, our quest is not hopeless. We just need to use the same measuring stick for each side. We switched to Steven Eichley, Geographic with the U.S. Geological Survey. The national hydrography data set - which collects all inland water bodies in the lake/lake category - was used to compare water bodies in Wisconsin and Minnesota using different thresholds. In Eichel's words, \"every variable of the question comes in the same way.\" According to federal data, Minnesota has 124,662 lake/bund features, while Wisconsin has 82,099. Minnesota has 8,784 lake/bund features with a name, while Wisconsin has 5,481. Minnesota has 14,444 Lake/Pond areas with an area of 10 acres or more, while Wisconsin has an area of 6,176. For the context, the area of 10 acres is approximately 7 and half football stadiums (including final areas). This is also what Minnesota uses to define lakes. Using 25 acres, Minnesota also has more than twice the number of lakes - 8,466 to 3,350. The lake measurements that Wisconsin wins fear not, readers and Wisconsin. We've searched for a few lake scales where Minnesota is missing. The deepest lake: the deepest natural lake in either state is the green lake in the middle of Wisconsin, at a depth of 236 feet. This is 27 feet deeper than the deepest entrance to Minnesota, Lake Ten Mile. == sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man Surface area: Wisconsin also dominates the percentage of the area covered by lakes, which is 17 per cent compared to 8 per cent in Minnesota. Of course, this number is significantly distorted by the inclusion of Lake Michigan on the Wisconsin side of the ledger, which goes well beyond the small corner of Lake Superior claimed by Minnesota. The removal of the Great Lakes from the equation, Minnesota has 5.4% of its surface area covered by the lakes compared to 2.7% in Wisconsin. Minnesota also has the largest lake, with a red lake (288,000 acres) that can easily reach Lake Wisconsin and Yenibago (137,708). We claimed Governor Minnie was proud of over 15,000 lakes - more than Minnesota. But these numbers use very different definitions for \"Lec,\" with thousands of counting to the account in Wisconsin that do not meet the definition in Minnesota. If both states use the minimum Minnesota standard of 10 acres - or, in fact, any other reasonable measure - then Minnesota has about twice the number of lakes. We appreciate Minnie's best by mistake. But we will give the spokesman for the Tourism Department the final word here: \"At the end of the day,\" Trost said: \"We are happy to let Minnesota prepare its lakes and championships for the Super Bowl, and we will prepare our championship.\" Sharing the facts of 2019-05-23 16:26:06 UTC Politifah 2 1 7 PoliticFact Dating: fail \"Wisconsin, many people may not be aware, in fact have 15,000 freshwater lakes.
