Reforms similar to those made in Wisconsin were later adopted at the federal level under President Bill Clinton, a Democrat, who had previously made welfare changes as governor of Arkansas.\n\nBut reforming welfare isn\u2019t the same as ending it.\n\nAs Thompson tries to burnish his conservative credentials against two other candidates for the GOP nomination in 2012, let\u2019s step back in time.\n\nBefore becoming President George W. Bush\u2019s health and human services secretary in 2001, Thompson served for 14 years as Wisconsin\u2019s governor. One of his signature accomplishments was \"Wisconsin Works -- W2,\" a measure he signed in to law in 1996.\n\nThompson\u2019s Senate campaign spokesman, Darrin Schmitz, cited W-2 as the primary evidence to back Thompson\u2019s claim.\n\nA booklet on W-2 produced by the Thompson administration at the time hailed the law as \"the end of welfare,\" saying it eliminated \"automatic welfare checks\" provided by the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program.\n\nFor decades, AFDC\u2019s cash entitlement to low-income families, which sometimes lasted for many years, was synonymous with \"welfare\" in America.\n\nAFDC included virtually no work requirements, but W-2 not only requires recipients to work, or engage in work-related activity such as training, it puts a five-year limit on how long they can be in the program.\n\nThere are several types of W-2 assistance. Some recipients, for example, work in private-sector \"trial jobs\" that pay at least minimum wage and are intended to become permanent, while others earn up to $673 per month working in community service jobs. In October 2011, the number of people in W-2, which is budgeted to cost $626 million in state and federal funds in 2010-2011, was nearly 16,000 -- up 15 percent from a year earlier.\n\nSo, Thompson replaced the AFDC entitlement with the work-required W-2 -- but does that mean he ended welfare, period?\n\nThe definition of welfare is key.\n\nThompson \"had a leading role in ending welfare as we previously knew it,\" said Jon Peacock, research director of the Wisconsin Council on Children and Families, a liberal think tank. \"Whether he eliminated welfare altogether is a matter of semantics. \u00a0If by welfare, one means an entitlement program that doesn\u2019t require work, then I think one can say that (Thompson) played a leading role in the effort to eliminate welfare. \u00a0If one uses a more expansive definition, equating welfare with public assistance generally or with any form of cash assistance, then it\u2019s not accurate to say it was eliminated.\" \u00a0\n\nNew York University professor of politics Lawrence Mead, who has done a number of studies on W-2, agreed.\n\n\"If welfare means the old system, then he\u2019s right, he did indeed abolish it,\" Mead said of Thompson, noting Wisconsin was the first state to create an \"all-work-based\" aid system.\n\nBut \"it\u2019s not true in a more literal sense,\" Mead said, because other forms of welfare -- such as food stamps -- still exist.\n\nFor instance, in October 2011, more than 800,000 low-income Wisconsin adults and children participated in FoodShare, Wisconsin\u2019s version of what used to be known as the food stamps program.\n\nMoreover, despite its strict work requirements, W-2 arguably has its own welfare components. For example, the custodial parent of an infant who is 12 weeks old or less receives $673 per month and is not required to work. That is, to be sure, a small group and a limited time.\n\nOur conclusion\n\nThompson declared that as governor, \"we ended welfare.\" His W-2 program didn\u2019t eliminate every program that might be considered a handout. But it did end the entitlement program most commonly known as welfare, replacing it with one that requires nearly all recipients to work for their benefits.\n\nWe rate Thompson\u2019s statement Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11958"}
