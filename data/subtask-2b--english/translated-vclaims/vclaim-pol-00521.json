At last night's National Congress fund-raiser, the curious and curious article says, \"If we don't do anything about this president, I will.\" It was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We have not been able to find any evidence that this article contains precise information. The National Democratic Commission did not respond immediately to an e-mail asking about the article. But the prosecution dates back to June 2018, after Obama spoke at a fundraiser in Beverly Hills, Califf. \"Obama committed himself to his routine not to say the name of President Donald Trump in public, but he spoke at length about his problems with Trump's presidency - and why he thought Democrats would be foolish to think that they were in good shape to beat him (in 2020) just because they were good at winning the last election,\" says the June 29th article. On January 18, 2021, in an interview with the right national radio program, \"China was behind intervention and effort to overthrow our government and elections, electoral fraud.\" By Daniel Funk: January 19, 2021, the President of the National Democratic Congress, Tom P\u00e9rez Obama, urged the crowd \"to give it up for the true President of the United States,\" but the story does not include any mention of the statement that Facebook describes Obama, or anything like that. Instead, he encouraged them to vote. \"Ex-President Barack Obama attempts to mobilize Democrats at the fund-raising event,\" reads the title of the article of time after the speech. When we searched the Nexis news database about the Facebook and Obama account, we did not find any results. Nor did we find the statement attributed to someone else in the news articles. On June 6th, the presidential candidates Joe Biden and Pieto Aurrok were among those, but the news did not mention Obama. Because apparently he wasn't there.
