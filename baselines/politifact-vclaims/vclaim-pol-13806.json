Some had to be kept under police guard until they could receive care.\n\nIn early 2008, police agencies continued to rack up thousands of dollars in overtime as officers waited in their squad cars or in hospital emergency rooms with patients who needed psychiatric crisis services.\n\nAccording to Jim Sullivan, one of the five candidates running in the Feb. 15, 2011, primary election for Milwaukee County executive, the problem persists.\n\nIn a Jan. 31, 2011 meeting with Milwaukee Journal Sentinel editors and reporters, Sullivan responded to a question about the Mental Health Complex by saying:\n\n\"When they\u2019re full up over there, our local police officers -- if you\u2019ve got somebody who needs to be over at mental health because they\u2019re mentally ill, they may pose a danger to themselves, any of these different things -- if it\u2019s full, cops sit out there in their squad cars with a mentally ill patient in the back and they have to wait to unload and people will, in some cases, spend an entire shift out there doing that.\"\n\nIf Sullivan is right, police officers are regularly experiencing hours-long delays at the Mental Health Complex when transporting someone who needs crisis services.\n\nIs he right?\n\nWe asked Sullivan, a former Democratic state senator from Wauwatosa, the basis for his statement. He did not have any direct evidence, but said he heard the Wauwatosa and West Allis police departments experienced such waits.\n\nThousands of people each year receive crisis care at the complex, 9455 W. Watertown Plank Road. Some are admitted to the 96-bed facility but most are treated and released.\n\nAs Sullivan indicated, crisis patients are brought to the facility, often by police, because they are deemed a danger to themselves or others.\n\nThe Journal Sentinel\u2019s Patients in Peril investigation has uncovered numerous problems at the complex, from bungled care of patients and staff members falsifying documents to skyrocketing overtime costs.\n\nBut delays faced by police officers transporting crisis patients have not been in the news recently.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Sullivan\u2019s claim about delays is contradicted by an October 2010 study by a national consulting firm, which found that changes made by the county \"have been very effective in reducing backups.\"\n\nThe finding was reiterated by the Milwaukee-based Public Policy Forum research organization in a January 2011 report, which summarized issues for candidates in the county executive race.\n\nThat report relied, in part, on a November 2010 county memo that showed a dramatic reduction in police waits beginning in 2008.\n\nTo further check Sullivan\u2019s statement, we contacted the two police departments he cited as well as the Milwaukee Police Department and the Milwaukee County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\nHere is what they told us:\n\nWauwatosa police: Long delays ended five or more years ago and current wait times are usually less than 30 minutes, said Capt. Jeff Sutter. \"It would be extremely unusual for us to have what I consider a long wait,\" he said.\n\nWest Allis police: Long waits ended three years ago, according to Chief Mike Jungbluth, who said his officers transport patients to the Mental Health Complex \"every day.\"\n\nMilwaukee police: \"We aren\u2019t experiencing the issue anymore,\" said spokeswoman Anne E. Schwartz.\n\nMilwaukee County sheriff: \u00a0Deputies usually wait about 20 minutes, said Capt. Darlene Jonas. If several officers are trying to get patients treated, the wait time could be one to two hours, she said.\n\nSo what\u2019s the bottom line?\n\nSullivan said delays in admitting people to the Mental Health Complex for crisis care can be so long that police officers spend up to an entire shift with patients waiting for them to receive treatment. Hours-long delays were a problem some years ago. But the four largest police agencies in the county now say waits are short. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nPerhaps there are isolated cases today in which officers waits for hours, but at minimum Sullivan\u2019s claim is clearly dated.\n\nWe rate it False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13806"}
