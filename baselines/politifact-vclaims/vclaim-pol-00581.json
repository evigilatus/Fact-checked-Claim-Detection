There was insufficient evidence and therefore, in our Country, a person is innocent. The case is closed! Thank you.\"\nU.S. Rep.\u00a0Mark Pocan, a Wisconsin Democrat, took issue with that characterization.\n\"The President\u2019s claim that \u2018There was insufficient evidence and therefore, in our Country, a person is innocent. The case is closed!\u2019 is incorrect and in direct contradiction to what Special Counsel Mueller said earlier today,\" Pocan\u00a0tweeted.\nIs Pocan \u2014 who has called for Trump to be impeached \u2014 right that the President contradicted Mueller\u2019s comments?\nThese are murky waters, but let\u2019s dive in.\nA question of evidence\nThe core of Trump\u2019s tweet \u2014 and therefore Pocan\u2019s claim about it \u2014 is the reference to \"insufficient evidence.\"\nNothing changes from the Mueller Report. There was insufficient evidence and therefore, in our Country, a person is innocent. The case is closed! Thank you.\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 29, 2019\n\nWhat did Mueller say about that?\n\"The first volume of the report details numerous efforts emanating from Russia to influence the election,\"\u00a0Mueller said, reading from notes at the Justice Department news conference. \"This volume includes a discussion of the Trump campaign\u2019s response to this activity, as well as our conclusion that there was insufficient evidence to charge a broader conspiracy.\"\nSo Mueller made a vague reference to \"insufficient evidence\" of a conspiracy related to Russian interference.\nTrump\u2019s tweet, meanwhile, implies a much more specific and far-reaching meaning \u2014 that there was no evidence Trump himself committed any crime. Mueller said no such thing.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on February 8, 2021 in a Newsmax TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOnly one person died on that day\u201d during the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 February 9, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, Mueller addressed a potential interpretation like Trump\u2019s in his comments.\n\"After that investigation, if we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so,\" Mueller said. \"We did not, however, make a determination as to whether the president did commit a crime.\"\nWhat\u2019s more, Mueller said his office didn\u2019t assess whether Trump committed a crime \u2014 because it could not issue any such charges against a sitting president anyway.\n\"Under longstanding department policy, a president cannot be charged with a federal crime while he is in office. That is unconstitutional,\" Mueller said. \"Charging the president with a crime was therefore not an option we could consider. \u2026 It would be unfair to potentially accuse somebody of a crime when there can be no court resolution of the actual charge.\"\nHe went on to refer to impeachment as the only way to address such a matter.\n\"The (Department of Justice) opinion says that the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing,\" Mueller said. \"Those were the principles under which we operated. And from them, we concluded that we would not reach a determination one way or the other about whether the president committed a crime.\"\nRon Boehmer, a spokesman for Pocan, said the congressman\u2019s tweet was referring to this limitation.\n\"Special Counsel Mueller did not reference insufficient evidence, but rather a restriction on being able to charge the President and made it very clear that he could not be cleared,\" Boehmer said in an email.\nSo, Pocan\u2019s \"direct contradiction\" claim isn\u2019t exactly cut and dried. Trump did use the same term as Mueller.\nBut it\u2019s clear Trump over-reached in his summary of Mueller\u2019s comments, claiming a level of vindication that Mueller didn\u2019t offer.\nOur ruling\nPocan said Trump\u2019s response to Mueller \u2014 that there was \"insufficient evidence\" and therefore Trump is innocent \u2014 is \"in direct contradiction\" to what Mueller said.\nMueller did use the term \"insufficient evidence,\" but that was in a generic reference to proof of a broad conspiracy involving Russian election interference. Trump\u2019s tweet treats that statement as a commentary on his own guilt or innocence.\nIn actuality, Mueller was very clear that he cannot charge a sitting president with a crime, and therefore out of fairness couldn\u2019t even accuse him of one. And Mueller was careful to note, \"if we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so.\"\nOur definition of Mostly True is a statement that is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.
