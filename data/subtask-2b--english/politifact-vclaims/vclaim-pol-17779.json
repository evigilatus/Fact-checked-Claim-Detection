Mike Gallagher, R-Green Bay, proposed a bill on Feb. 14, 2020 aimed at forcing health systems to lower costs: the Transparent Health Care Pricing Act of 2020, which would require providers to publicly disclose the price of their products and services. It echoed a similar bill Gallagher cosponsored in 2019 that won bipartisan support.\u00a0\nThe new bill was referred to committee that same day and hasn\u2019t moved since, but Gallagher appeared June 25, 2020 on a Fox News program to discuss its effects if enacted.\u00a0\nOn the segment, Gallagher said health care consumers don\u2019t act as conventional consumers because they don\u2019t compare prices before purchasing.\u00a0\nAnd rising costs, he claimed, have led to an unusual circumstance: \"The average family in America forks over more of their hard-earned income to their local hospital than to the IRS.\"\u00a0\nIs Gallagher correct?\u00a0\nHospital expenditures vs.\u00a0federal taxes\nWhen asked for backup for the claim, a Gallagher spokesman pointed to a Jan. 26, 2019 Forbes opinion piece aptly titled \"In 2018, The Average Family Paid More To Hospitals Than To The Federal Government in Taxes.\"\u00a0\nThe piece was written by Avik Roy, president of the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity, a right-leaning think tank based in Austin, Texas. He breaks down the math problem he\u2019s used to examine hospital costs and payments to the IRS.\u00a0\nHe started with what Americans spend on hospital care overall: $1.2 trillion in 2018.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat is on the money \u2014 according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, 33% of the nation\u2019s $3.6 trillion in health spending during 2018 went to hospital care.\u00a0\nWhen divided by the 327.2 million people who lived in the U.S. that year, each person accounted for about $3,667 of that sum. Using census data to determine that the average American family consisted of 2.5 persons, Roy asserted that the \"average\" family\u2019s share of money spent on hospital care was just under $9,280.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s about 14.7% of the 2018 median household income, which the census bureau placed at $63,179.\u00a0\nComparatively, Roy says, the average family pays a lower percentage of its income in federal taxes. He points to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which the federal Joint Committee on Taxation estimated would bring the average tax rate for a median-income household down from 14.8% to 13.5% for households that brought in $50,000 to $75,000 per year in 2019.\u00a0\nA median household income would fit into that range, and -- based on the earlier math -- would pay a larger share than that in hospital costs.\u00a0\nOur ruling\u00a0\nGallagher said the average American family pays more to hospitals than in federal taxes.\u00a0\nOf course, \"average\" does not point to a singular real-life scenario here \u2014 no American family has 2.5 children and makes exactly the median income. Indeed, many families have no hospital expenses in a given year.\nBut numbers behind the claim relating to average situations add up.\nWe rate the claim True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17779"}
