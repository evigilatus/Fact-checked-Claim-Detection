Tony Evers supports a plan that allows people to smoke and sell small amounts of drugs. Evers said that one of the objectives of the proposal was to reduce the disproportionate rate of imprisonment of the black population in the state. \"People shouldn't be treated like criminals for drugs that can change or maybe even save their lives,\" said Evers at a press conference in February 18, 2019 declaring his plan. In support of the Evers Plan, David Crowley, Deputy Head of State, De-Melloaki, referred to high incarceration rates for African-American males. More than 40% of African-American men in my county were going to jail for low-level drug offences, and I think a hundred times that in Madison City, Crowley said on February 24, 2019, in \"The City of D.C. on Sunday.\" Is Crowley right? When requesting support, the Miloki District Prison mentioned Crowley staff at the University of Wisconsin-Milwake 2013. According to the study, \"The collective imprisonment of African American males: Labour Force Challenges 2013\": \"40 per cent of African American males from Milwaukee District who have been imprisoned since 1990 were drug criminals.\" But this covers all drug offences, while Crowley used the number to describe \"low-level drug crimes.\" Therefore, Crowley is clearly unable to do so, although it is difficult to know how much it is. Molly Vidal, spokesman for the United States Department of Corrections, said in an e-mail: \"There is no universally defined or defined definition of 'low-level crime' in Wisconsin.\" Under the Evers Plan, which faces strong opposition in the Republican-controlled legislature, the State's agricultural and health administrations will organize medical marijuana and users, and medical marijuana manufacturers and distributors will not be charged with crimes if they deal with up to 25 grams of medicine. From the perspective, 25 grams of marijuana can expand inside a plastic sandwich bag. According to NORML, the National Organization for the Reform of marijuana Laws, marijuana is a hallucinogenic substance in Schedule I under the Common Control Substances Act in Wisconsin. The penalties may vary depending on the amount or whether it is the first or multiple perpetrator. For example, the first charge of possession of an offence is a misdemeanour that can result in imprisonment for up to six months and a fine of up to $1,000, while the possession of any sum (subsequent offence) is a felony and can result in imprisonment for up to 3.5 years and a fine of up to $10,000. The November 2018 report on the admission of Dan County Prison states that \"in general, only criminal offences result in a person being ordered to enter Wisconsin State prisons.\" For the second part of the claim, Madison's rate is \"100 times\" from Milwaukee County, Assistant Crowley Kyle Cochwell said that the legislator misunderstands \"Comment 100x was wrong,\" Codell said via e-mail. \"It refers to the number in (a) the City Lap article of 2016 which states that 'in the province of Denmark... black residents have been admitted to prison for drug offences at a rate of 97 times the average white population.\" The figure underlying this quote is that the rate of entry of African-American prisoners into drug prisons is 433.76, while the rate of entry of white drugs is 4.46. The figures come from the United States Office of Justice Statistics. Anyway, it's a highly mixed comparison. The study in question compares the difference between black and white prisons within the province of Dan. There's nothing to say about the extent to which the rate of African-American prison in Milwaukee County is compared to the rate in Dean County. (In addition, Crowley also misstated Madison, not Dan County.) On January 10, 2021, in a television interview, \"It takes a long time on election day to download those cards, which is why we have 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. to throw the ballot papers at Milwaukee.\" \u2022 January 15, 2012. What about the gap? So, where do things stand when it comes to the prison hole? On January 12, 2018, the Pew Research Center article indicates that the gap is shrinking. Using figures from the Office of Justice Statistics, the report states that \"the significant decline in the number of black prisoners in recent years has steadily narrowed the gap between blacks and whites in the prison to half as large as in 2009, when the prison population in the United States peaked.\" The article also says: At the end of 2016, some 486,900 black prisoners and 439,800 white prisoners, a difference of 47,100, were detained in federal and state prisons in the United States, according to the Prison Service. In 2009, there were 584,800 blacks and 490,000 whites, a difference of 94,800. (This analysis is limited to prisoners sentenced to more than one year.) Of course, since there are more whites than blacks in the country, the rate is a better measuring stick. The article states: \"In 2016, there were 1,608 black prisoners per 100,000 black adults - more than five times the White Prison rate (274 per 100,000) and almost twice the rate of Spanish-born prisoners (856 per 100,000). It also notes that the rate has declined for all three categories since 2009. For blacks, this proportion has declined to the most acute (25 per cent), compared with 19 per cent for Hispanic Americans and 11 per cent for whites. On July 10, 2018, CNN &apos; s report referred to a number of theories about what was behind the bridging gap, from the law enforcement force in rural areas, most of the white areas, to the explosion of opioids and heroin, which were most affected in white communities. These reports relate to national figures. At the same time, data from the Department of Corrections of the State of Wisconsin show that the number of black offenders who have been imprisoned and convicted in the province of Milwaukee, whose most serious crimes have been a drug offence, has been decreasing for the most part since 2009: 2009 - 510 offenders 2010 - 505 2011 - 361 2012 - 291 2013 - 251 2014 - 245 2015 - 219 2016 - 237 - 2017 - 235 - 2018 - 236, the last available year, approximately 54 per cent less than in 2009. Our Crowley classification says \"more than 40% of African-American men in my country were going to jail for low-level drug offences, and I think a hundred times that in Madison City.\" It was dependent on several levels -- from misapplying Milwaukee District Number to low-level crimes only, His assistant confessed Crowley to \"mistal error.\" For inaccurate statement, our assessment is wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00876"}
