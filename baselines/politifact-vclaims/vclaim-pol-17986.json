But as the message was shared \u2014 and shared, and shared \u2014 someone made one significant and misleading change to the message.\nSomeone took a post from a person named Serena Williams and manipulated the image slightly to make it appear as though it came from the tennis superstar of the same name.\nHere\u2019s an image of the post being shared with the profile picture altered to look like it came from Williams the tennis pro.\n\nThe authentic post, from the non-famous Serena Williams, is here. In her bio, she notes: \"Nope, not THAT Serena Williams.\"\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe post does not appear on the Facebook page belonging to Serena Williams, the tennis star.\u00a0\nStill, many have gotten tripped up by the wrong post being shared, including NBA player Rudy Gobert.\nFor what it\u2019s worth, the viral post does not sound like something Williams the tennis star would say. She has supported causes related to the Black Lives Matter movement. She hosted a discussion on her Instagram page, with Bryan Stevenson, the founder and executive director of the Equal Justice Initiative, a human rights organization in Montgomery, Ala. In the video, Williams said she knows she\u2019s been \"wronged\" because of her race, and \"that\u2019s terrible that I have to expect that.\" She described how her father moved from Mississippi to California because of concerns over his safety.\nWilliams, the tennis pro, also talked about Confederate statues, saying: \"Why would you want to look at a statue of someone who wanted \u2026 mass killings of innocent people?\"\n\nOur ruling\nAn image being shared online purports to come from tennis star Serena Williams. It says, in part, that she\u2019s \"sick of COVID-19. I\u2019m sick of black vs. white. I\u2019m sick of Democrats vs. Republicans. I\u2019m sick of gay vs. straight.

I\u2019m sick of no one being allowed to think what they want & feel what they do without offending someone.\"\nThe words were written by a person named Serena Williams, but someone took that post, and changed it so that it looked like it came from Williams the tennis star.\u00a0\nProfessional athlete Serena Williams never wrote that, and based on recent interviews, probably wouldn\u2019t agree with the sentiment.\nWe rate this claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17986"}
