There are add-on packages and inflationary costs, general fund dollars and one-time dollars and all-funds budgets. Numbers by themselves don\u2019t mean much without context.\n\nSo, naturally, our ears perked right up when Portland Mayor Sam Adams made this statement in a budget work session shortly after the Nov. 6 election: \"In the last four years we\u2019ve cut $36 million in ongoing revenue.\" He also tweeted the number Nov. 13and used it again in a year end-interview with the Portland Mercury. \u00a0\n\nSounds gloomy, right? But remember, this is the same mayor who once hooted about a one-time $22 million budget surplus in February 2011, and we found that claim to be Half True. So we wanted to know more about these dollar \"cuts.\" We decided to give his statement the full Truth-O-Meter treatment.\n\nWe were aided by one of The Oregonian\u2019s Portland City Hall reporters, who immediately pointed out that the $36 million was really closer to $25.6 million because the city had added $10.3 million for new programs over the same period.\n\nIn other words, Adams had to \"cut\" as much as he did because he chose to spend money elsewhere. Apparently this was not news to anyone at the budget meeting because Andrew Scott, the city\u2019s financial planning manager, clicked through a PowerPoint presentation with a slide that outlined $25.6 million in \"ongoing shortfall\" and $10.3 million in new program additions.\n\nNow, we bet you\u2019re asking for the definition of an \"ongoing shortfall.\" Government budgets don\u2019t stay flat, obviously. The cost of maintaining the same programs goes up every year, sometimes beyond the cost of inflation, whether due to increases in demand for services or steep hikes in health and retirement benefits.\n\nWhen projected revenue falls short of dollars needed to maintain services, that\u2019s the shortfall. State and local governments can\u2019t print money like the federal government, so they have to fix the shortfall by raising revenue (usually taxes) or cutting services, pay, etc.\n\nElected officials may always choose to add new programs. But if they don\u2019t have enough money, they have to reduce or eliminate other programs. We call that making choices; we could even call that \"budgeting.\" We\u2019ve called out politicians previously for talking about \"budget cuts\" when government has had more money than the year before, just not enough to cover a shortfall and pay for new programs. \u00a0\n\nWe also bet you\u2019re asking for some hard numbers.\n\nThe city\u2019s total annual budget is in the $3.5 billion range, but Adams is talking about the much smaller amount known as the general fund. The general fund includes property taxes and business license fees, but does not include gas taxes, sewer and stormwater charges or water fees.\n\nThe numbers vary, depending on how you slice them, from $349.5 million to $472 million in 2009-10, to 352.5 million to $490 million for 2012-13.. But no matter how you look at the numbers, if you compare apples to apples, the figures today are higher, even slightly, than what they were in 2009-10, with ups and downs along the way. In other words, today\u2019s budget is not $36 million less than the 2009-10 budget, which is what the average person probably thinks when the mayor says that he has \"cut $36 million in ongoing revenue.\"\n\nScott, the city\u2019s financial planning manager, disapproves of our simplistic way of looking at numbers. He says that you can\u2019t compare dollars to dollars because that doesn\u2019t account for steep growth in government costs, such as participation in the Public Employees Retirement System or health insurance. The cost of running government doesn\u2019t stay the same from year to year.\n\nHe\u2019s right about that, but taxpayers and non-wonks don\u2019t live in a world where buying everything you did the previous year, even if it costs more, is considered spending the same in dollars.\n\nHad Adams just said the city had cut services, he\u2019d be on more solid ground. Of course, he\u2019d also have to mention that the city had added services. But that\u2019s not what the mayor said either.\n\nHe stated $36 million in ongoing cuts. That\u2019s not true, even if his spokeswoman stands by the statement.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmanda Fritz\n\n\nstated on October 3, 2011 in in campaign literature\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that \"In 2009, I saved ratepayers around $500 million by persuading the Council to pursue a less expensive compliance mechanism if the City is required to treat Bull Run drinking water.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Janie Har \u2022 October 11, 2011\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHis statement contains some connection to reality: The city has not been able to spend $36 million that it needed to maintain current services over the four years. Part of the reason is because the mayor and council chose instead to spend $10 million on other programs. The remaining $25 million was based on an expectation of maintaining the status quo.\n\nWe rate the statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09926"}
