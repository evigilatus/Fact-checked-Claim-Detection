The article went on to claim that he called on Muslim voters to \"wage jihad,\" and that a video promoting the message was created, translated and endorsed by the U.S. government.\u00a0\nThe headline read, \"EXCLUSIVE UPDATE: Video of Joe Biden Calling for a Muslim Jihad Was Created, Translated, Promoted and Endorsed by the US Government.\"\n\"Yesterday The Gateway Pundit reported that most Americans didn\u2019t realize it or see it but Democrat Joe Biden in a recent ad called for Muslim Voters to wage jihad,\" the article goes on. \"The former Obama vice president called for Muslim voters to wage jihad while attacking the police.\"\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nThe video, which is embedded in the article, shows clips of Biden first promising to \"end the Muslim ban on Day One,\" then quoting the Prophet Muhammed. After that, it plays a political ad Emgage created for its campaign to turn out one million Muslim votes. The entire video is accompanied by subtitles and a Voice of America logo in the corner.\nThe article claims that the video was translated into Urdu and aired on U.S.-sponsored sites \"to promote jihad and the Biden campaign. What is our government doing?\"\nHere\u2019s what we know.\nThe clips of Biden in the video all came from Emgage\u2019s Million Muslim Votes Summit conducted virtually on Zoom in July. It was followed by a clip of Emgage\u2019s political ad to galvanize Muslim votes, which was also played at the same summit.\u00a0\nBiden\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. But in his speech that clocked in over 11 minutes, Biden quoted the Prophet Muhammed after encouraging Muslims to vote: \"Whomever among you sees wrong, let him change it with his hand. If he is not able, then with his tongue. If he is not able, then with his heart.\" Biden went on to say that \"so many\" Muslims are living these values by acting to \"make life better\" for their communities and promoting peace.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYasir Qadhi, a prominent cleric and dean of the Islamic Seminary of America, said the hadith encourages Muslims to act if they see something that goes against their moral values. If they can\u2019t, they should say something about it or in the very least disagree with it in their hearts, Qadhi said.\u00a0\n\"Even the radical jihadists don't use this particular hadith to justify their misinterpretations,\" Qadhi wrote to PolitiFact by email.\n\"Jihad\" in Arabic literally means \"struggle.\"\u00a0\nVoice of America, a U.S. government-sponsored broadcast that airs stories to international audiences, took a copy of the video, created captions in Urdu and promoted it as part of its Urdu-language news report. Voice of America said in a July statement that senior journalists removed the video after it had been published on VOA\u2019s Urdu language service and social media sites. The U.S. Agency for Global Media was investigating whether the video violated editorial standards or laws about government employees, the statement said.\u00a0\nVOA\u2019s spokesperson directed PolitiFact\u2019s inquiry to the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. Politico reported on the controversy in July and said four contractors at VOA\u2019s Urdu language service had been responsible for publishing the video.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not the first time Biden\u2019s words from the Muslim outreach event was taken out of context; PolitiFact in July debunked a claim that Biden wants Islam to be taught in schools.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nThe Gateway Pundit article claims that a video of Joe Biden \"calling for a Muslim jihad was created, translated, promoted and endorsed by the U.S. government.\"\nBiden did not promote \"a Muslim jihad.\" He was encouraging Muslim Americans to vote. He said many of them lived Muhammed\u2019s teachings by advocating for their communities and preaching peace. \"Jihad,\" while often used to mean terrorism, is a broad word that can simply mean \"struggle.\"\nThe Biden video cited by the Gateway Pundit was translated by contractors of Voice of America, a U.S.-sponsored site, for its Urdu language service. But the video was deleted shortly afterward by VOA\u2019s senior journalists. And the incident was being investigated.\nWe rate this claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18680"}
