We all know that all of us are.\"\n\nWe\u2019re not going to delve into a debate about whether the health care law is going to save the country money or cost \u00a0more by extending coverage to millions of uninsured Americans. But we were curious whether a family with that much income would truly qualify for a federal subsidy.\n\nBut before we hook up the Truth-O-Meter to Glover\u2019s statement, let\u2019s first revisit the basics of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which President Obama signed into law March 23, 2010.\n\nOne of its centerpieces is the so-called \"individual mandate.\" Beginning in 2014, most U.S. citizens will be required to obtain health insurance, according to a summary of the law published by the Kaiser Family Foundation, an often-cited source of information on health care policy. If they don\u2019t, they\u2019ll face penalties that by 2016 will rise to $695 or 2.5 percent of taxable income for individuals, whichever is greater.\n\nEnter the exchanges. Their purpose is to create a marketplace that helps keep costs down by spurring competition between insurers while delivering to them vast numbers of consumers, including younger healthy people, many of whom lack insurance now.\n\nExchanges will be established in every state, with the federal government stepping in to create ones in states that opt not to participate. Rhode Island was moving toward establishing a state-based health-benefits exchange when Gallagher appeared on Glover\u2019s show on Sept. 7. (On Sept. 20, Governor Chafee issued an executive order directing the establishment of an exchange.)\n\nBoth individuals and small businesses will be able to purchase coverage through exchanges when they open in 2014.\n\nWhile the exchanges are intended to be affordable, it\u2019s expected that plenty of people will still need financial assistance. That\u2019s where the federal subsidies come in.\n\nCalled \"premium tax credits,\" the subsidies will be offered to income-eligible consumers who purchase insurance through an exchange. The credits will be paid directly to an insurer to help families that might not have the cash to make timely payments.\n\nSo back to Glover\u2019s statement. Would a family of four making $88,000 a year qualify for the subsidies? The short answer is yes.\n\nThe guidelines are spelled out clearly in the Kaiser summary, as well as at HealthCare.gov, a Web site of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThey state that taxpayers with household incomes up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level -- $89,400 a year for a family of four in 2011, according to the U.S. Treasury Department -- will be eligible for credits.\n\nFamilies at that level would contribute 9.5 percent of their income -- $8,493 -- \u00a0to their health insurance premium. The tax credit would cover the remainder.\n\nThose with lower incomes would contribute less and get bigger credits. A family at poverty level -- $22,350 for a family of four -- would contribute 2 percent of their income, about $447.\n\nThe Treasury Department, in an Aug. 12 notice, noted that the Congressional Budget Office estimates that individuals receiving tax credits will get an average subsidy of more than $5,000 per year.\n\nOur ruling\n\nGlover, quoting a talk show guest, said a family of four with an income of $88,000 would be eligible for a health insurance subsidy. That figure is actually $1,400 below the threshold to receive a subsidy.\n\nAnd it\u2019s in 2011 dollars, meaning that by 2014, when exchanges are scheduled to begin operation, it could be adjusted upward to reflect inflation.\n\nWhile the diagnostic services of our Truth-O-Meter are not covered by any known health plan, we administer them freely. This claim gets a True.\n\nComment on this ruling on our PolitiFact Rhode Island Facebook page. And follow us on Twitter: @politifactri.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-12321"}
