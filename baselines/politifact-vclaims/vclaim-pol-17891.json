A Tulsa World photographer captured a still image of the truck\u2019s driver placing a handgun on his dashboard for demonstrators to see.\"\u00a0\nAt least two protesters suffered minor injuries as the truck drove through the crowd, the World reported.\nThe Oklahoma Highway Patrol is still investigating the incident and is not releasing any details, spokeswoman Sarah Stewart told PolitiFact on June 6.\nVideo from the incident shows protesters throwing items at the truck and trailer, pounding their fists on the vehicles and jumping onto the trailer as it moved through the crowd. It\u2019s not possible to see into the trailer.\u00a0\nThe person with the smoking object threw it over the trailer, not into it. The side of the trailer that the person was on did not appear to have any open windows. There is no sign of any fire in that video or in a longer video that is posted with a Tulsa World news story.\nVideo from a live report from KTUL-TV shows that after passing through the crowd, the truck pulled over briefly where highway troopers were stationed.\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post says protesters burned horses to death in a vehicle that drove through a crowd of protesters. Without any evidence of fire, we rate the Facebook post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17891"}
