At least part of the story showed up in a couple of other posts also questioned by Facebook users.\nAldean was performing onstage at a Las Vegas country music festival on Oct. 1 when a gunman opened fire on the crowd from a hotel room, killing 58 and injuring 489 more. He appeared for a musical performance on Saturday Night Live on Oct. 7, singing I Won\u2019t Back Down,\u00a0which also served as a tribute to Tom Petty, who died Oct. 2.\nThe AsAmericanAsApplePie.org post, however, mixed some real details with some entirely fictional ones. It said Aldean addressed the audience before the song to say \"people should not own more than one gun,\" and blamed the National Rifle Association for the massacre. Aldean did not do that.\nIt then gives a real quote from Aldean, who said about shooting victims, \"So I want to say to them, \u2018We hurt for you, and we hurt with you.\u2019 But you can be sure that we\u2019re going to walk through these tough times together, every step of the way. Because when America is at its best, our bond, and our spirit, it\u2019s unbreakable.\"\nYou can watch the real statement and performance here:\n\nThe post snaps back into fake events by saying Aldean \"took a knee\" as the band played part of the national anthem, and told people \"not to cave to the NRA\u2019s terroristic agenda\" and \"always stand up to gun violence and the policies that enable it.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNone of those things happened, but the article said it spurred a #BoycottJasonAldean hashtag and led to the cancellation of Aldean\u2019s concert in Birmingham, Ala.\nAldean\u2019s Birmingham show was Aug. 10.\nThere is a #BoycottJasonAldean hashtag, but it\u2019s difficult to tell if it stems from this fake story, which has fooled many people on Twitter, of Ultimate Fighting Championship president Dana White\u2019s condemnation of Aldean for choosing to perform on SNL over UFC 216 in Las Vegas the same night.\nAldean did cancel three California shows after the shooting \"out of respect for the victims, their families and our fans,\" but returned to Las Vegas on Oct. 8 to visit with shooting survivors.\nAsAmericanAsApplePie.org has all the hallmarks of a series of fake websites associated with Christopher Blair, a self-described liberal troll who creates fictional stories to try to fool conservative readers.\nWe\u2019ve fact-checked plenty of stories that originated from websites run by or affiliated with Blair, including TheLastLineOfDefense.org, FreedomCrossroad.us, OurLandOfTheFree.com and FreedomJunkshun.com.\nAsAmericanAsApplePie.org uses the same website architecture as these other sites, and carries a disclaimer that reads, \"As American as Apple Pie is here to be your beacon of something you can kinda rely on sometimes but not really.\" We reached out to the site but did not hear back.\nThis fake story capitalizes on real events but inserts false details into the narrative to confuse readers.
