Chris Christie appointed state attorney general Jeffrey Chiesa to serve as an interim senator after Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg died June 3. Chiesa is a Republican \u2013 a political party that hasn\u2019t represented New Jersey in the U.S. Senate in nearly two generations.\n\nIn the meantime, Christie has scheduled a special primary for Aug. 13. Four Democrats and two Republicans have filed to run in the primary. A special general election is scheduled Oct. 16, when history could be made again if voters send a Republican to the Senate.\n\nThe historic possibility wasn\u2019t lost on former Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, who discussed it June 4 during an interview on the John Gambling radio show.\n\n\"We haven't had a Republican senator in Washington for ... why, I think Clifford Case was our last Republican senator,\" Whitman said.\n\nWhitman\u2019s claim is on target, but she\u2019s not quite correct.\n\nLet\u2019s review some history.\n\nDemocrats have held both of the state\u2019s Senate seats for more than three decades, PolitiFact New Jersey determined earlier this year after Christie claimed during a speech at the libertarian Cato Institute that the state was coming up on the 40th anniversary of the last time voters elected a Republican \u2013 Case -- to the Senate.\n\nCase started his fourth six-year term in the Senate in 1972 and lost a bid for re-election in the 1978 GOP primary to Jeffrey Bell.\n\nBill Bradley, a Democrat, defeated Bell in the 1978 general election, starting the Democratic dominance of New Jersey\u2019s two Senate seats.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJake Tapper\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in remarks in a CNN broadcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second presidential impeachment of Donald Trump was \u201cthe most bipartisan impeachment in American history.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Case wasn\u2019t the last Republican to represent New Jersey in the Senate. That distinction goes to Republican Nicholas Brady, who was appointed to a Senate seat in April 1982. Then-Gov. Tom Kean appointed Brady to fill in for Democrat Harrison Williams Jr., who was forced to give up his Senate seat after bribery and conspiracy convictions stemming from a federal corruption probe called ABSCAM.\n\nSo Case was the last Republican senator actually elected by New Jerseyans to the Senate, but Brady was the most recent Republican to serve the Garden State in the Senate prior to Chiesa\u2019s appointment. We make that distinction because Whitman didn\u2019t.\n\nBrady, who would go on to serve as U.S. Treasury secretary in the Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations, stepped down in December 1982 after Lautenberg won that year\u2019s general election for the Senate, defeating Republican Millicent Fenwick. Kean appointed Lautenberg to complete the final days of the term.\n\nLautenberg started his first full term in January 1983 and served three six-year terms before retiring. He returned to the Senate two years later and served until his death.\n\nIn addition to Chiesa, who said he will not run in the special election, Democrat Robert Menendez also represents New Jersey in the Senate. He was re-elected in November.\n\nWhitman spokesperson Heather Grizzle said the former governor declined comment.\n\nOur ruling\n\nWhitman said during a radio interview, \"We haven't had a Republican senator in Washington for ... why, I think Clifford Case was our last Republican senator.\"\n\nBrady was the last Republican to serve in the Senate, for eight months in 1982, prior to Chiesa\u2019s appointment. Before that, Case was the last Republican that New Jersey voters elected to the Senate.\n\nSince Whitman referred to the \u2018last\u2019 Republican senator to represent New Jersey, that title goes to Brady. We therefore rate the former governor\u2019s claim Mostly True.\n\nTo comment on this story, go to NJ.com.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09226"}
