That's half right.", "text": "Joe Biden responded to criticism of immigration policies enacted during his term as Vice-President by attacking President Donald Trump &apos; s record, claiming that Trump &apos; s polarization strategies did not occur when he was second in command. During the September 12th presidential debate, Paden said that Obama's administration didn't lock people in cages. We've assessed this as a mistake. \"The Obama administration - Biden did not launch raids at the workplace - and ended these raids,\" said Paden on Twitter that night. \u2219 (Almost 700 immigrants were detained by immigration agents last month in seven chicken processing plants in Mississippi). The Obama administration - Biden - did not launch workplace raids - and ended these raids. Is it true that the Barack Obama administration did not launch raids in the workplace, but ended these raids? Paiden is partially right. Obama has ended large-scale arrests of migrants in their workplaces, and priority has instead been given to prosecuting employers who hire unauthorized workers. However, some migrants were still detained when clients appeared to the workplace to carry out a search warrant against employers. The arrest of unauthorized migrants in the Immigration Act at the workplace prohibits employers from knowingly employing persons who are not legally authorized to work. Employers are required to verify the identity and suitability of employees, and to complete and maintain relevant verification forms known as I-9. The United States immigration and customs enforcement authorities, or the Immigration and Customs Service, implement the provisions of the Act through \"worksite enforcement.\" \"Ride\" is the general word used when a large number of people are arrested by the CIA at work or elsewhere. During President George W. Bush's second term, CIA agents arrested hundreds of immigrants simultaneously, mostly in factories and meat processing plants. One of the most notable raids in 2008 took place in a meat-packing plant in Iowa, when agents landed in helicopters and arrested approximately 400 workers. In April 2009, almost three months after the first state of Obama, the Institute announced a new focus on the criminal prosecution of employers who knowingly employed illegal workers in the country. A memorandum from the Immigration and Naturalization Service stated that the arrest and dismissal of workers alone was insufficient and that a focus on employers would target the root causes of irregular migration. The Agency also stated that it would continue to arrest and deport unauthorized workers they faced during operations. On February 1, 2021, Tom Cotton mentioned in an interview with Fox and friends \"Many of these arriving immigrants, we have no way of checking their background for either health or security.\" \u2022 On 3 February 2021, instead of mass labour raids, the Institute, under the auspices of Obama, focused on reviewing employers &apos; forms I-9 to determine whether they complied with the Immigration Act. The Commission has followed up on some cases with on-site law enforcement. According to media reports in 2010 and 2011, ICE audits became known as \"silent raids,\" which often led to the dismissal of employees once their employers were notified by ICE of irregularities on I-9 forms. (CIC gives employers time to correct any errors in the forms.) Government data on law enforcement operations in the workplace show that the number of individuals arrested on charges of violation of immigration law decreased after Obama took office. The spokesman for the Institute Paul Prince of Bolivi Fact said that the arrest data did not mean that many persons had been arrested in situ, although in some cases that was possible. (For example, a person may have been arrested elsewhere, but is the result of an investigation in the workplace). In a report issued in June 2015 by the Congressional Research Service, it was unclear why there had been an overall decline from 2008 to 2014 in immigration and criminal arrests in the workplace, \"but to some extent they might reflect the Institute's renewed focus on employers. In view of the data on migrants arrested in workplace enforcement operations, Biden is wrong to claim that there were no \"incursions on the workplace,\" as said by Ray Koslovsky, an immigration expert and assistant professor at the University of Albany, State University of New York. However, Biden is correct in that the Obama administration ended the Bush administration &apos; s practice of maximizing the number of staff detained during workplace raids, often by hundreds at a time, while the Obama administration failed to prosecute many of its employees, as Koslovsky said. The Obama administration had shifted to targeting employers (although unauthorized workers present during operations had also been arrested). After the arrest of approximately 700 people in August in Mississippi, John Sandwig, a former acting director of the Central Intelligence Agency during Obama's administration, told the National Broadcasting Authority that during their \"focus on the employer,\" \"they will not waste resources in arresting those who appear to work unless these individuals... have some indications that they constitute a threat to public safety.\" The Prince, speaking on behalf of the Immigration and Naturalization Board, said that the Council's strategy \"will continue to focus on the criminal prosecution of employers who knowingly break the law and on the use of first- to ninth-level audits and the imposition of civil fines to encourage compliance with the law.\" The governor, Payden, said, \"The Obama and Paden administration hasn't launched workplace raids, actually, I've finished them.\" The Obama administration ended the practice of large-scale raids in which hundreds of migrants were arrested simultaneously. Obama gave priority to prosecuting employers who knowingly employed unauthorized workers. This has been done through increased audits of forms I-9. But that doesn't mean there were no operations at the site. In some cases, workers were arrested when agents of the Intelligence and Security Service carried out search warrants.
