U.S. Rep. Tom Price, a Republican from Roswell, recently revived this retro claim about Internal Revenue Service agents as he emphasized the court\u2019s finding that the bill is constitutional under the federal government\u2019s taxing powers:\n\n\"This is indeed a tax. We talked about it at the time with the 16,000 IRS -- new IRS agents -- that will be empowered to enforce this new tax,\" Price said during a C-SPAN call-in show June 29. \u00a0\n\nSixteen thousand new IRS agents? That claim sounded awfully familiar to us here at PolitiFact Georgia.\n\nAs presidential hopefuls, Ron Paul, Jon Huntsman and Michele Bachmann used versions of this claim, as have other politicians, including Georgia\u2019s own U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss. \u00a0\n\nEven the most accurate versions of this talking point earned mediocre ratings on the Truth-O-Meter. They ranged from Pants on Fire to Half True.\n\nDid this claim improve with age like a fine wine? We contacted Price\u2019s office, dug through past PolitiFact research and looked at a recent IRS budget request.\n\nThe main reason that past claims earned low Truth-O-Meter ratings is that the number comes from a partisan estimate based on squishy assumptions.\n\nThis is how the IRS talking point came to be:\n\nOn Dec. 19, 2009, the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan referee on budget questions, released an analysis of the Senate version of the health care bill that became the basis for the health care law. \u00a0\n\nThe CBO wrote that it had not completed cost estimates for the IRS and other federal agencies responsible for implementing the law. But it did say the IRS \"would probably\" need to spend \"between $5 billion and $10 billion over 10 years.\"\n\nThe CBO suggested nothing about how those costs would translate to jobs, PolitiFact National found. \u00a0\n\nRepublicans with the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee, which handles federal tax legislation, used the high end of the IRS\u2019 rough budget number to estimate 16,500 employees might be hired to implement the bill.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nPolitiFact ruled that Republicans cherry-picked the high number to favor their case. Also, even Ways and Means Republicans acknowledged that the figure could be less than 16,500 new jobs. Their calculations do not take into account the possibility that some of the money would buy things such as desks and office supplies for new workers.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\nIn other words, it\u2019s fair to assume the IRS will need to hire new employees. It may need thousands of them. But using such a specific figure suggests a degree of certainty that does not exist.\n\nFurthermore, Ways and Means Republicans did not find that the IRS would have to hire 16,000 or more new \"agents,\" as Price and other Obama health care bill foes have said. That number was for \"employees,\" a broader category that can include other workers such as administrative assistants, phone operators and staff attorneys.\n\nNow the IRS is hiring staff to implement these changes. Price spokesman Ryan Murphy told PolitiFact Georgia that current hiring numbers suggest that the 16,000 estimate is reasonable.\n\nWe took a look at the IRS budget requests to check out this assertion.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the IRS requested funding for more than 1,250 employees to prepare for the health care tax changes, according to its budget proposal. Most would fill support roles in areas such as information technology or customer service. Fewer than one-quarter would be agents.\n\nFor next fiscal year, the IRS requested funding for nearly 860 employees. Fewer than 10 percent would be agents.\n\nThis places the agent tally for fiscal years 2012 and 2013 near 375.\n\nHow do we rule?\n\nPrice said that 16,000 new \"agents\" would be empowered to enforce the health care law. His claim carries a kernel of truth. The IRS will have to hire agents to implement these changes.\n\nBut his statement misstated the findings of a partisan estimate. Ways and Means Republicans said that about 16,000 \"employees,\" not \"agents,\" may be hired to enforce the bill\u2019s provisions. They also acknowledged that the actual number of hires may be lower.\n\nIRS budget requests for the 2012 and 2013 fiscal years show they asked for about 375 more agents so far -- \u00a0far less than 16,000.\n\nAnd like other pols who have used versions of this talking point, Price used such a specific figure that he suggests a degree of certainty that doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nPrice therefore earns a Mostly False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10796"}
