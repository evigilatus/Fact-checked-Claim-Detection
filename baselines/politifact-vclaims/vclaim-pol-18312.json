In Milwaukee, there were only five polling locations for a population of almost 600,000.\n\n\nThis was concerning because fewer polling locations means more people had to come together to vote. The state was under a stay-at-home order to reduce the spread of COVID-19, and the governor has extended the order until at least May 26.\n\n\nMissouri Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft has called Wisconsin officials' handling of the situation \"ludicrous.\" But it appears he has been inconsistent with the numbers he reports.\u00a0\n\n\nOne week after the Wisconsin election, he went on\u00a0St. Louis radio station 97.1 FM\u00a0to talk about Missouri\u2019s June 2 election. He said his state could handle things better and still keep in-person elections.\n\n\nHe used Milwaukee as his prime example of how in-person voting went wrong in Wisconsin.\u00a0\n\n\n\"When you look at Wisconsin, in their largest city they normally have roughly 500 polling places, and when they just had their election a week or two ago they had five,\" Ashcroft said. \"That is ludicrous.\" \u00a0\n\n\nIt\u2019s not the only time Ashcroft has changed the numbers.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAshcroft\u2019s reports\n\n\nWhat are the real numbers? Executive director of Milwaukee\u2019s election commission, Neil Albrecht, confirmed that for a typical election the city has 180 polling places.\n\n\nIn Wisconsin\u2019s most recent election it was reduced to five polling places. The reduction in polling places was the result of fewer people volunteering to be poll workers.\n\n\nFifty-two people across Wisconsin who had been at the polls on election day have tested positive for COVID-19. It can\u2019t be confirmed, however, that they were exposed at the polls.\u00a0\n\n\nA little over a week after Ashcroft stated that Milwaukee typically has 500 polling places, he went on\u00a0St. Louis Public Radio\u00a0and gave the correct number, 180. In the same breath, however, he then reported that Milwaukee had reduced the number of polling places for the April 7 election to four, off from the five that were really available.\u00a0\n\n\nWhile a difference of one may not seem like a lot, the error going from five to four is 20%.\n\n\nThe director of communications for the Secretary of State\u2019s Office acknowledged\u00a0that Ashcroft misspoke in both instances. \u00a0\n\n\nOur ruling\n\n\nAshcroft said that for the April 7 presidential primary, Milwaukee would \"normally have roughly 500 polling places. They just had their election a week ago, and they had five.\"\u00a0\n\n\nHe exaggerated the number of usual polling places by a lot, but he is correct about the number of reduced in-person locations.\u00a0\n\n\nHis claim is partially accurate, so we rate it Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18312"}
