Christian Adams, president of the Public Interest Legal Foundation. \"Our nation\u2019s voter rolls have records that cannot be distinguished between living or dead; citizen or alien; resident or relocated. We hear about possible cyber-attacks, but we aren\u2019t doing enough to fix voter rolls that are certainly corrupt.\"\nThe Public Interest Legal Foundation, which aims to keep voter rolls as up-to-date as possible, had sent letters to nearly 250 counties. Bryan County was among them.\nThe group\u2019s letter to county elections supervisor Cindy Reynolds said, \"Based on our research, your jurisdiction is in apparent violation of Section 8 of the National Voter Registration Act.\" It explained that the letter was the required statutory notice \"prior to the commencement of any lawsuit.\"\nThe county\u2019s key problem, according to the foundation, was that it had \"significantly more voters on the registration roles than it has eligible, living citizen voters.\"\nIn this fact-check, we looked at whether Bryan County\u2019s voter rolls are corrupted, as the news release charged.\nThe short answer is that the situation in Bryan County is cleaner than the foundation would have us believe. The fact is, maintaining the voter rolls in Georgia is an ongoing process and the foundation counted names on the Bryan County list that were flagged for possible removal.\nThe active vs. inactive voter difference\nFoundation spokesman Logan Churchwell told us that his group relied on the latest federal survey from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission. That spreadsheet showed 20,285 active voters and 5,622 inactive ones in Bryan County on the rolls for the November 2016 election.\nWhat are inactive voters? People who haven\u2019t voted in the past two elections, have been sent a letter to confirm their registration and haven\u2019t responded to that letter.\nThe foundation added the two groups and reported a total of 25,907 voters.\nIt then compared that to the number of county residents age 18 and older. Using the latest Census figures, that was 25,643.\nNot all of them would necessarily be eligible to vote, but \"that gives the county the maximum benefit of the doubt,\" Churchwell said.\nWith 264 more names on the rolls than the total of potentially eligible voters, the foundation included Bryan County on its list of those with corrupted voter rolls.\nIncluding the inactive voters is essential to that finding. The problem evaporates based on active voters. Judged against that, there are 5,358 fewer names on the rolls than the total potentially eligible population.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChurchwell defended his group\u2019s methods, saying \"all a person on the inactive list needs to do is respond and like that, they are back on the rolls.\" The county can\u2019t \"pretend they aren\u2019t there,\" he added.\nKeeping the rolls current\nThe relationship between voter rolls and residents is constantly in flux. Many people move away and some die, to give the two biggest factors. The same survey used by the foundation gives a glimpse into how election officials try to keep up.\nImportantly for this fact-check, it also shows what the size of the inactive list can tell us about changes in the active voter rolls.\nThe foundation counted all inactive voters, but there\u2019s good reason to question that.\nIn Georgia, the state maintains the voter rolls, not the counties.\nBetween 2014 and 2016, the state sent 4,323 letters asking people in Bryan County to confirm their voting status.\nIn the same period, the state removed 2,579 names.\nPut another way, take about 60 percent of the inactive total and you get the number of names that will be dropped. Apply that to the 2,622 on the November 2016 inactive list and you\u2019d expect that 1,542 names would drop from the rolls.\nThat alone would put the number of voters below the number of potentially eligible voters by about 1,200.\nIn fact, Bryan County election supervisor Reynolds said the state cut 2,934 names from the rolls as of September 2017. The state was more aggressive than it had been over the past two years.\n\"This is a regular process by the Secretary of State provided by Georgia laws to ensure that our rolls are as accurate as possible,\" Reynolds said in a statement.\nWe wondered how often the group\u2019s assertions led to successful lawsuits.\nChurchwell told us that in 2015, his group targeted 141 counties. Of those, they brought legal action against eight, resulting in one settlement and two consent decrees to improve roll maintenance practices.\nOur ruling\nThe Public Interest Legal Foundation said Bryan County had corrupted voter rolls because it had more voters registered than the eligible population in the county. The foundation relied on the number of voters listed as inactive to reach that conclusion.\nThat is a worst-case approach that does not account for the reality of voter roll maintenance in Georgia. Based on all the data, there\u2019s no evidence that the Bryan County rolls are corrupted. The group took a number that reflected an effort to keep the voter rolls current and used it to cast the county in a bad light.\nThe foundation used data selectively and ignored ongoing efforts to clean up the voter rolls to reach an exaggerated conclusion.\nWe rate this claim False.\n Share the Facts 2017-10-04 16:59:42 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  Bryan County, Ga., has \"corrupted voter rolls.\"    Public Interest Legal Foundation Anti-vote fraud activist group https://publicinterestlegal.org/blog/248-counties-registered-voters-live-adults/   In a press release Monday, September 25, 2017 2017-09-25    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02836"}
