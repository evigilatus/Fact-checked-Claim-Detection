The State Election Council ordered the holding of new elections after finding a rigging vote in the Ninth District, where Republic Mark Harris appears to have overcome the democracy of Dan McCreedy. Political agents working for the Harris campaign collected the absent ballot papers and, according to some testimonies, cast illegal votes and forged the signatures of witnesses. In a speech in the Senate Chamber, Republican majority leader Mitch McConnell recently referred to the North Carolina case while criticizing Democrats for not doing more to prevent electoral fraud. He said that absent voting laws threatened \"the nature of our representative democracy\" because they allowed political activists to control the ballot papers. \"When these agents control those ballots, the voters will have no way of monitoring whether they have been delivered,\" said in February 26, according to this version. Is it true that absentee voters have no way of knowing whether their ballots have been delivered or not? The McConnell letter made no specific reference to any State. But his claim was made while he talked about what happened in North Carolina. However, in North Carolina, electoral officials provide a way for voters to track their voices. This method requires that voters have access to a computer and know how to sail online, which may be an obstacle for some voters. According to a research survey conducted in 2018, 11% of Americans do not use the Internet. However, this is how voters can \"watch\" their voices. \"A absentee vote, by law, is not counted until election day, although requests for absence have been approved throughout the absence period through absentee meetings of district councils,\" said Pat Gannon, spokesperson for the National Convention Election Council. \"There are ways to track absent ballots through our public statements, and many people outside this agency used those data to look at absentee voting irregularities in the 2018 election cycle,\" he said: One way to track your ballot is through the NC Election Board's \"Voice Search\" tool on its website: ncsbe.gov. The tool is currently appearing on the left side of the home page of the website. Once registered voters enter their names and strike \"search,\" they will be taken to the web page with the results of the search. These findings may show several names on the list. The voters can click on their names, which will take them to a new page. The page will show voter information such as their political party addresses and affiliations and polling places. One part of the page entitled \"Excess request\" By clicking on it, voters can see when the absent ballot was sent, where it was sent, and whether the District Council received a recorded ballot. On January 26, 2021, in the North Carolina tweet, Secretary of State Ellen Marshall, Jenna Woodsworth stated, \"She has won state-wide races more than anyone else is likely to be alive.\" \u2022 On 1 February 2021, District Election Councils in North Carolina were entrusted with the task of tracking the progress of requests for absentee ballots. \"If a voter wants to do so, he can search for his information in the web-based daily table file produced by the provinces and the State Electoral Council every day of early voting.\" They can consider the column marked \"received\" to see whether the missing persons were obtained by post, as Pitzer said. They can also see whether the ballot was \"accepted\" or rejected, with the relevant date. When we provided this information to the McConnell office, Maconel Don Stewart's spokesperson suggested that the delivery of absent ballots opened the door to fraud. Stuart said: \"The electorate has no way of knowing whether the actual or alternative ballot is.\" \"If you give me (someone you do not know) your ballot, sign your name on a different ballot and run the different ballots, you have no way of controlling whether or not your ballot has been delivered,\" follow. \"You can only trust that I did the right thing, but there's no way to track it.\" This theory is not only far-fetched, it is \"after impossible\" to implement, as Gannon said, the Speaker of the NC Electoral Council. \"What they propose will take a conspiracy on a large scale, and it will lead to multiple crimes committed by the conspirators for each ballot,\" said Gannon, referring to the scenario put forward by Stuart. Gannon said that every ballot absent in NC had special markings and a special number. First, a person who may attempt to replace a blank ballot must obtain blank ballots, \"which contain special markings, are printed on special papers and are cut in specific ways,\" he said. \"This requires theft from the county council office, the county officer or the polling clerk must be in the conspiracy,\" said Gannon. Second, each province usually has many voting methods for each election, so anyone who is likely to try to replace the ballot should be able to access all voting methods,\" continued. \"Third, county council officials write CIV in each ballot. This number is reserved for individual voters. Intruders must write this number in each fraudulent ballot in a manner that does not raise the red flag to the District Council when the ballot returns.\" McConnell said that once political agents hold onto those cards, \"The voices have no way of monitoring whether they've been delivered.\" The Election Council of the National Convention enables voters to track the status of absent ballots on the Internet. This may not help some voters who do not use the Internet. However, it is an option available for tracing. We're assessing this allegation mostly wrong.
