It\u2019s only a small group of radicals who oppose those names. Indians are proud of Indians.\u2019 -Walter \u2018Blackie\u2019 Wetzel, 2002, Washington Post.\"\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nThis is mostly accurate. Walter Wetzel, a former Blackfeet tribal chairman, is credited as the driving force behind the creation of the team\u2019s current logo, and the quote attributed to him is genuine. But he himself did not \"design\" the logo.\u00a0\nThis history doesn\u2019t change the fact that numerous American Indian tribes and advocacy groups, including ones Wetzel was affiliated with, have called for the team to change its name and imagery for years.\u00a0\nMembers of Wetzel\u2019s family told media outlets that they\u2019re sad to see the logo go, but agreed the name needs to be changed.\nFirst, some history\u00a0\nThe team was initially based in Boston and was called the Braves before former owner George Preston Marshall gave it the latest name in 1933. The team relocated to Washington, D.C. in 1937 and received the first of its trademarks for the name in 1967.\u00a0\nIn 1972, Native American leaders representing multiple organizations requested that the team change its name, calling it a derogatory racial epithet.\u00a0\nWetzel, who had served as the Blackfeet tribal chairman and president of the National Congress of American Indians, asked team executives that same year to drop the \"R\" logo that was used at the time in favor of a profile of an Indian warrior.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWetzel spoke with the Washington Post in 2002, shortly before he died, and said he had told the team he\u2019d like to see an Indian on their helmets instead of the big R.\u00a0\nWithin weeks, the team had a new logo based on a composite of Native American photographs, including one of early 20th-century Blackfeet chief, Two Guns White Calf.\u00a0\n\"It made us all so proud to have an Indian on a big-time team,\" Wetzel told the paper, \"It's only a small group of radicals who oppose those names. Indians are proud of Indians.\"\nAlmost five decades later, Wetzel\u2019s family expressed mixed reactions to the team\u2019s announcement.\u00a0\nHis grandson, Bill Wetzel, told the Great Falls, Mont., Tribune (which is based about two hours from the Blackfeet Indian Reservation) that his grandfather was a good, honest man, and it bothered him that his grandfather\u2019s name had been associated with a racial slur, but that times had changed.\nJacob Wetzel, his great-grandson, told the paper that while the name change is \"long overdue,\" he was still sad to see the family legacy go.\nThe NCAI, which describes itself as the country\u2019s oldest, largest and most representative American Indian and Alaska Native advocacy organization, has pushed for the team to drop the name and imagery for years.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe organization commended the team for its decision.\n\"We thank the generations of tribal nations, leaders, and activists who worked for decades to make this day possible. We commend the Washington NFL team for eliminating a brand that disrespected, demeaned, and stereotyped all Native people, and we call on all other sports teams and corporate brands to retire all caricatures of Native Americans that they use as their mascots,\" the group said in a statement.\n\"We are not mascots \u2014 we are Native people, citizens of more than 500 tribal nations who have stood strong for millennia and overcome countless challenges to reach this pivotal moment in time when we can help transform America into the just, equitable, and compassionate country our children deserve,\" it said.\nBut not all tribal members agree with the name change. Some say that the logo has been a point of pride, while others say teams like Washington that use Native American mascots are guilty of cultural appropriation and exploitation.\nOur ruling\nPosts on Facebook say Walter Wetzel, a former Blackfeet Nation tribal leader, \"designed the Redskins logo\" and said it made Native Americans proud.\nWetzel persuaded team executives in 1972 to change its logo to a profile of an Indian warrior, though he himself did not design it. He did once say in a Washington Post interview that it \"made us all proud to have an Indian on a big-time team.\"\nMeanwhile, numerous tribes and Native American organizations say the team\u2019s name and imagery is offensive and have fought for years to have it changed.\nWe rate this Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17747"}
