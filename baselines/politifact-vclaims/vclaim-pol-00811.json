It says Kennedy uttered these words seven days before his assassination. Kennedy was shot to death on Nov. 22, 1963.\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nWe couldn\u2019t find the quote included in a list of quotations by the president on the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum website. But the library is often asked about the statement, said archivist Stacey Chandler.\n\"When there is a credit or citation line, it typically suggests this was part of a speech at Columbia University in late November 1963,\" she said. Sometimes the quote is attributed to Kennedy on Nov. 15, 1963, she said. Other times, it\u2019s Nov. 12, 1963. But researchers have never found evidence that Kennedy spoke at Columbia on either of those dates, or any time in 1963, according to Chandler.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 30, 2021 in a blog post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cTrump assassination foiled, Deep State in panic mode!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 February 4, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe library also has records related to speeches he delivered as president and he gave two on the 15th, seven days before his assassination, but those don\u2019t appear in either, Chandler said.\nYou can read transcripts of the speeches he gave in New York City that day here\u2014at the \u00a0AFL-CIO convention\u2014and here, at the National Convention of the Catholic Youth Organization.\nHis schedule from Nov. 15 doesn\u2019t include a visit to Columbia nor any other speeches or events.\nChandler said the library has a few ways of searching presidential statements, including keyword searches of archival holdings, historical newspaper coverage and speech databases such as the Presidency Project at the University of California, Santa Barbara.\n\"We\u2019ve never found a match for this statement through any of these resources, and we haven\u2019t been able to confirm it via secondary sources, either,\" Chandler said.\nMarc J.
