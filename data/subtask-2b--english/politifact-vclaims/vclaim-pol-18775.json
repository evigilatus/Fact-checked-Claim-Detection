He accused Biden of relying too much on his notes.\u00a0\nA video that\u2019s being shared on Facebook takes that a step further and alleges that this time, Biden had an iPad at his podium.\u00a0\n\"Watch him grab his notes, and then watch one of his staffers grab his iPad, go and grab his iPad,\" a man can be heard saying as a recording of the end of the debate plays on the screen. \"Now watch stage right, no one\u2019s going to Trump\u2019s, let me grab that iPad that\u2019s giving you all the answers.\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Biden is leaning over and seems to be talking to moderator Kristen Welker. Trump and first lady Melania Trump leave the stage. Then around the 1:58:00 mark, Biden can be seen grabbing what looks like pieces of paper and a pen and leaving the stage with his wife, Jill Biden.\nContrary to what the narrator in the Facebook video says, around the 1:58:08 mark, someone approaches Trump\u2019s podium and removes a notepad with a brown, cardboard back. Another person then approaches the vice president\u2019s podium and removes an identical notepad.\u00a0\nThere is nothing in the video to suggest that either person picked up an iPad.\nWe rate this claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18775"}
