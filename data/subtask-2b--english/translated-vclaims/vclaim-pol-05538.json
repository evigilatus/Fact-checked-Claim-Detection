Weapons are particularly emotional in South Carolina after Dylan Ruff was charged with the murder of nine African Americans in Charleston Church in June. Mr. Sanders, Senator from Vermont, defended his record of weapons, saying that \"from day one, he supported an immediate background check to ensure that people who should not have weapons do not have weapons.\" Clinton once again shot Sanders with a list of his votes on arms bills, including one: \"He voted for what we call the Charleston Gap.\" \"We wanted to know what Clinton meant by the Charleston Gap\" and if Sanders voted for it. Brady Bill Clinton and some of the supporters of gun rules said that Ruff was offended by the three-day time limit to check the background of gun purchases. The gun rights supporters say the blame goes to the FBI and his failed papers. Under the current federal law, the Federal Bureau of Investigation is verifying the background of potential buyers of firearms in South Carolina and 29 other states through the system of prompt national verification of criminal background information. (The rest of the states verify their own background) If the cheque is not rejected or completed within three days, the seller of the weapon may proceed with the sale. Ruff was able to get a weapon for clerical errors. Ruff tried to buy a gun in West Columbia on April 11th. An FBI examiner found Ruff was arrested on a drug charge on March 1st. Since the records did not show a conviction, the examiner could not deny the purchase but continued to consider the criminal history of Rove. The newspaper Adana Rove misstated the office of the mayor of the neighbouring province as the agency that arrested him, prompting the FBI examiner to request more information from the wrong offices. On January 13, 2021, bloggers announced the extraordinary truth-checking story in which General David H. Berger, the commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for the use of marines for installation security, saying, \"We're not working for you.\" By Samantha Butterman, on January 17, 2021, when the three days were over, the case was still listed as \"suspended\" and Ruff was able to buy the weapon. Two months later, Ruf allegedly shot and killed nine worshippers and wounded one of them in a historic black church in Charleston. He faces a trial for murder later this year. Those three days were at the heart of the Brady Handgun Prevention of Violence Act, which was passed in 1993. A word about waiting periods: The Brady Bill did not include a waiting period for buyers to wait for their firearms to be received. ........................................................................................................ Instead, the bill set a time limit - sometimes called a failure to move forward - for the Government to verify its background. And then in the U.S. House of Representatives, he voted against Brady's bill five times -- including a copy that returned a five-day deadline to check the background. In November 1993, Sanders voted in favour of an amendment requiring immediate background verification instead. The problem is that the technology required for conducting immediate examinations did not exist at the time. As a result, according to the post-fact Washington document, supporters of the Brady Bill were forced to negotiate a compromise. What was first proposed as 10 days for the government to make the cheque was eventually converted into three days. The final compromise of the Brady Bill was approved and signed into law in November 1993. It prohibited the transfer of arms to an unauthorized person, unless three working days had elapsed and the regime did not notify the carrier that it would violate the law. Saunders voted against the final bill. The Director of Sanders Jeff Weaver's campaign in July told us that Sanders voted against the bill because he believed that the national waiting period was a federal overrun and because he was responding to his constituents. (We did not get a response from Sanders' campaign the night of the debate on the Clinton attack.) So for the bottom line: Sanders supports the reduction of time when the government has had to conduct background checks. Whether the extra time would have prevented the roof from buying an unclear weapon. Our referee, Clinton, said Saunders is a voice for what we call the Charleston Gap. In 2015, Ruff was able to buy a weapon after the government ran out of time to run background checks -- as a result of a clerical error when the FBI sought records from the wrong local law enforcement agency about Ruff. It is still not known whether more time can make a difference. But Ruff was able to buy the gun after the three-day waiting period. Saunders voted in 1993 to reduce the time available to the Government for its examination. The roof was able to purchase a weapon after waiting three days to verify its background. We're mostly assessing this claim right. Clarification: This verification process was edited on 19 January to clarify the waiting periods and time limits for verification of background information.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05538"}
