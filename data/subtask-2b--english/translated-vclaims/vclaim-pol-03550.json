Instead, he says he got it directly from the Willen Times. On March 15, the host of Fox News Tucker Carlson Trump asked why the agencies did not ask for any possible surveillance of him or his campaign before tweeting about it, since the White House did not seem to have any evidence to support his claims. \"Well, because the New York Times wrote about it,\" answered Trump. \"Not that I respect the New York Times. I call it The New York Times \"Lost.\" But they wrote in January 20, using the word \"eaves.\" \"The New York Times Report uses the word \"eaves;\" the main title of the printing was \"The borrowed data used in the Tramp Ides investigation.\" However, Trump does not seem to have read the article very closely because he does not say that Obama personally ordered his phones to be tapped during the election, as Trump claimed in his tweet. How far did President Obama go to bug my phones during the very sacred election process? This is Nixon/Watergate. A bad man (or a sick man) - Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTromp) 4 March 2017 The New York Times article on intercepted contacts used by the FBI during its investigations into some of the current and former Tramp assistants - including Roger Stone, Carter Page, Paul Manafort - and their links to Prussia. There is no mention of whether surveillance targets Russians or Americans. Nor does he mention that Trump and his campaign were under investigation or surveillance. In fact, the author says: \"It is not clear whether the communications intercepted had anything to do with Mr. Trump's campaign, or Mr. Trump himself.\" The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" By Samantha Buterman: January 11, 2021, the difference between the essence of the New York Times article and what Trump claimed was important, because Trump's tweet claims that Obama may have acted out of the law to harm a political opponent, while the New York Times described aspects of the FBI investigation. The president cannot unilaterally order the surveillance of an American citizen. The FBI has to get a warrant from a judge first, and in order to do so, investigators will need to suspect evidence that Trump has committed a crime. As president, Trump can see if the court has issued such an order. Congress has asked FBI Director James Comay for any evidence that a judicial order has been requested, issued or rejected. In his interview with Carlson, Trump also referred to part of Fox News with host Brett Bayer as a source. However, that part - and some other news articles provided by the White House as evidence - discusses unsubstantiated allegations that the FBI has requested orders to monitor Trump's partners. He does not support Trump &apos; s accusation that Obama personally ordered Trump &apos; s eavesdropping on charges of political sabotage. The Governor Trump said, \"The New York Times wrote about\" Obama spying on him during the election. The New York Times article indicates that the FBI used interceptive contacts in its investigations with several Trump partners and their links with Russia. He does not say that Obama ordered such surveillance, nor does he say that Trump &apos; s private phones were under surveillance or that he was under surveillance in any way. Trump took an article about legitimate intelligence investigations and completely distorted it. We value his claim that he is a liar. &quot; Political realities shared 5 policy assessments: \"The New York Times wrote about\" Barack Obama bugging Donald Trump during the elections.
