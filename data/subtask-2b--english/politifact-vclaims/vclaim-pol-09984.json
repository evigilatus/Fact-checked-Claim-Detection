State law allows that at bars as well as restaurants with liquor licenses.\n\nAnd as Health First says, the Wisconsin law sets no age restriction.\n\nBut it\u2019s important to note that establishments can decline, on their own, to serve parent-accompanied minors.\n\nThe Wisconsin Tavern League doesn\u2019t tell its members how to handle it, but many are not comfortable serving the underaged, executive director Pete Madland said. Others do so.\n\nMadland said it\u2019s an option for people who want to teach their children how to drink responsibly, a practice he noted is common in European countries with lower legal drinking ages.\n\nHow does Wisconsin compare?\n\nWe did not check on all 50 states because the available national research doesn\u2019t get to the level of state-by-state detail required to fully check this.\n\nBut we didn\u2019t need to check all 50 to assess the group\u2019s Wisconsin-stands-alone claim.\n\nWe found that many states allow parent-supervised underage drinking at home by their children. And a few allow underaged drinking by 18-20 year olds at bars if they are accompanied by parents or guardians.\n\nWhat\u2019s at issue here is narrower: how many states allow underage imbibing at bars (and restaurants) at any age.\n\nBased on our reporting, Wisconsin is not alone, though it appears to be a very short list.\n\nLaws in Texas, Ohio and Montana closely mirror the law in Wisconsin.\n\nTexas: In many places in the Lone Star State, persons of any age can consume or possess alcohol in bars and restaurants when in the \"visible presence\" of their adult parent, legal guardian or spouse, according to the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission.\n\nUnlike in Wisconsin, those accompanied drinkers can\u2019t actually buy booze themselves. But their adult parent, guardian or spouse can buy it for them.\n\n\"It does happen,\" commission spokeswoman Carolyn Beck said of parent-supervised drinking in public places. They hear occasional complaints, especially in divorce situations in which someone objects to a former spouse getting alcohol for their child.\n\nTexas has some \"dry\" counties and cities that prohibit some or all alcohol sales, but there\u2019s still a way for underage drinkers to tip one legally, Beck said. At private clubs in dry areas, adult members can get served and in turn can provide booze to their children, under the same law that applies at bars.\n\nOhio: Sales to underage drinkers are allowed if they are supervised by a parent, a spouse who is not an underage person, or a legal guardian. Tavern owners can allow underage drinking on premises if one of those persons gives the liquor or beer to the underage person and is present when they drink it, according to the Ohio Division of Liquor Control and state statutes.\n\nBartenders can refuse to serve these drinkers if they want to. As in Wisconsin, no minimum age is specified.\n\n Montana: \u00a0An exception to Montana\u2019s underage drinking law allows a person under 21 to receive a \"non-intoxicating quantity\" (less than 0.5 percent of alcohol by volume) from that person\u2019s parent or guardian. It doesn\u2019t rule out that happening in licensed drinking establishments. But it\u2019s a legal gray area because another law contradicts that and the exception is not clearly written. No minimum age is specified.\n\nThe state\u2019s Liquor Control Division suggests that minors not be served; the office is trying to change the law to rule out such sales on licensed premises.\n\nSo that\u2019s the quick tour.\n\nWe asked Julia Sherman, coordinator for the Wisconsin Alcohol Policy Project at the University of Wisconsin Law School, to describe Wisconsin\u2019s relative position among the states on this.\n\nShe said Wisconsin\u2019s statute is \"out of the mainstream\" in allowing drinking under such circumstances.\n\n\"Ours is clearly extremely broad,\" Sherman said.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t stand alone.\n\nOur rating\n\nA health advocacy group pushing to tighten up drinking laws said Wisconsin is \"the only state that allows parents or guardians to purchase alcohol for their children \u2013 regardless of whether that child is seven or 20 years old \u2013 at bars and restaurants.\"\n\nWe found less than a handful of states that allow that, but a few others do. So Wisconsin\u2019s law is not unique.\n\nWe rate the group\u2019s statement False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09984"}
