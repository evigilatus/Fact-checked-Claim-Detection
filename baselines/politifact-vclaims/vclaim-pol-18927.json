But at least one comment attributed to him on social media is baseless.\u00a0\nA Sept. 11 Instagram post shows an image of what appears to be a newspaper clipping from Oct. 27, 2015, with a headline in quote marks: \"\u2018Africans Are Lazy, Good At Sex, Theft.\u2019\" Under the headline is a picture of Trump with his mouth open as if he were photographed mid-sentence. The first sentence of the story reads, \"Business magnate Donald Trump has expressed his deep distrust for Africans by referring to them as lazy fools only good at eating, lovemaking and thuggery.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Social media users have revived the old claim in this fabricated newspaper clip despite the fact that it was debunked by other fact-checking organizations as long ago as 2015.\nPolitiFact searched news archives for any record of Trump saying the quote or anything similar, and found nothing.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSnopes reported that several African websites in 2015 claimed that Trump, then a candidate for president, made the comments in Indianapolis. But there is no evidence any U.S. or international news outlet reported on the comments, which would have been considered newsworthy. What\u2019s more, his campaign events leading up to Oct. 27, 2015, when this false news story was supposedly published, were in Jacksonville, Fla., and New Hampshire. He was not in Indiana during this period.\nEven stories that focus on offensive things the president has said do not include this quote.\nThe closest we found: In his 1991 memoir, former Trump business associate John O\u2019Donnell wrote that Trump once called Black people lazy. \"I think that the guy is lazy,\" the quote attributed to Trump says. \"And it\u2019s probably not his fault because laziness is a trait in Blacks. It really is; I believe that. It\u2019s not anything they can control.\"\nOur ruling\nAn Instagram post shows an image of a newspaper story that claims Trump said \"Africans Are Lazy, Good At Sex, Theft.\"\nThere is no evidence Trump said this.\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18927"}
