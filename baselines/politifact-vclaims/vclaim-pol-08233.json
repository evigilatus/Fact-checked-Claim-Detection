But it wasn\u2019t taken during Russia\u2019s 3-1 quarterfinal loss to Finland.\nThe photo was taken during an earlier game in the tournament between Russia and Slovakia. The Russians actually won the game where the photo was taken. The Russians beat Slovakia 1-0 in an overtime shootout.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe image making the rounds was captured by Sasha Mordovets, a contributor to Getty Images, on Feb. 16, 2014. (We confirmed this through Getty's image archives.)\nOther photographers also captured the two Russian leaders at the Russia-Slovakia game. We found some from the Russian news agency Ria Novosti. The Russian government also released photos from the Slovakia game where Putin and Medvedev did not look quite as sad.\n(It does not appear that either Putin or Medvedev even attended the Finland game. Putin was in Moscow for at least part of Feb. 19, and Medvedev was 6,500 miles from Sochi in the city of Mirny, where he toured a government space facility.)\nOur ruling\nA photo making the rounds on Twitter shows a sad-looking Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev allegedly after Russia\u2019s tournament-ending hockey loss to Finland. The photo is legit. But it was taken days earlier, during a Russian 1-0 victory against Slovakia.\nWe're guessing Putin and Medvedev are sad that their team lost. But the photo circulating on the Internet does not actually depict that.\nWe rate the claim Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08233"}
