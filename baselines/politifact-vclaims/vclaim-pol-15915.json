His opponents have attacked his plan as \"government-run\" health care.\n\n\n\"No. 1, let me just repeat, if you've got a health care plan that you like, you can keep it,\" Obama said. \"All I'm going to do is help you to lower the premiums on it. You'll still have choice of doctor.\"\n\n\nObama is accurately describing his health care plan here. He advocates a program that seeks to build on the current system, rather than dismantling it and starting over.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

It increases eligibility for the poor and children to enroll in initiatives like Medicaid and the State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program. And it has several strategies to rein in costs for everyone, such as streamlining medical record-keeping and emphasizing preventive care.\n\n\nObama has said he would like his plan to be universal, in that everyone has health care coverage. But currently it includes a mandate only for children. Obama has said that he did not include a mandate for adults so as not to penalize people with modest incomes.\n\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Obama's plan will actually be able to achieve the cost savings it promises for the health care system.
