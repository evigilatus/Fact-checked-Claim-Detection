It says:\u00a0\n\"Passing along corona advise from a retired respiratory therapist\" for \"the otherwise generally healthy population.\"\u00a0\nIt lists eight recommendations, starting with:\n\"For people experiencing mild to moderate respiratory symptoms with or without a COVID-19 diagnosis. \u2026 Only high temperatures kill a virus, so let your fever run high. \u2026 Use common sense and don't let fever go over 103 or 104 if you got the guts.\"\nThe final recommendation is: \"If your still dying go to ER.\" (Yes, it says, \"advise\" instead of \"advice\" and \"your\" instead of \"you\u2019re\" in the post.)\u00a0\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nWe\u2019ll first note that it\u2019s best to take your medical advice from health care professionals, not from random Facebook posts.\nDoctors say it\u2019s true that a high temperature can help the body fight off a virus, but not enough is known about the new coronavirus to support the post\u2019s advice, and running a high fever could be dangerous.\nWhat is a fever?\nA fever means you have a temperature of 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) or higher, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\u00a0\nFevers are a common sign of illness, but they also play a key role in fighting infections.\nGenerally speaking, a fever is \"basically a symptom of your immune system trying to fight the virus\" Richard Watanabe, a professor of preventive medicine at the University of Southern California, told PolitiFact. \"The higher temperature does make it more difficult for some viruses to survive.\"\nThe Mayo Clinic offers general tips \u2014 for otherwise healthy people and not specifically for coronavirus \u2014 on deciding whether to treat a fever or let it run its course. For example, for adults with a temperature above 102, Mayo recommends acetaminophen (Tylenol and other brands), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB) or aspirin.\u00a0\nBut it says treatment decisions also depend on age, medical history, other symptoms and other factors,\u00a0 not just temperature.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 25, 2021 in a blog post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWHO now saying you do not need to wear a mask.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFever and the coronavirus\nFever, along with cough and shortness of breath, is among the symptoms of COVID-19. If you have symptoms and think you have been exposed to COVID-19, call your healthcare provider, the CDC advises.\nCDC\u2019s Self-Checker tool can help you make decisions about seeking medical care. Mayo Clinic also offers a tool that helps you decide on seeking medical care and whether you need a COVID-19 test.\nIf you\u2019ll be treating COVID-19 symptoms at home, get enough rest, stay well-hydrated, and take medications to relieve fever and aches and pains, Harvard Medical School says.\u00a0\nFor fever, aches and pains, the school recommends acetaminophen. But if you are taking any combination cold or flu medicine, keep track of all the ingredients and doses, and make sure not to exceed a total of 3,000 milligrams of acetaminophen per day.\nMayo Clinic recommends rest and fluids, as well as cough medication, and pain relievers such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen.\u00a0\nThere have been some claims that using ibuprofen to treat coronavirus symptoms is risky. We found that some medical experts believe ibuprofen\u2019s anti-inflammatory properties could damp the immune system\u2019s ability to fight off COVID-19. But experts say this is just a theory and that there\u2019s no scientific evidence that links ibuprofen and other anti-inflammatory medications with COVID-19 complications.\nThat said, there is no rule that says you need to lower a fever with over-the-counter medication if you\u2019re feeling only mild symptoms and are not uncomfortable, Consumer Reports says in an article on COVID-19 and fevers. It lists a cold compress for sweating and blankets for chills, along with rest and liquids, as alternatives.\u00a0\nThe article says there is an argument for letting a fever run its course, because lowering a fever with medication might suppress your body\u2019s ability to fend off illness, \"but if your fever is running at or above 103 degrees, you should call a doctor. A high fever could lead to a seizure or brain damage.\"\nDr. Myron Cohen, professor of medicine, microbiology and immunology, and epidemiology at the University of North Carolina and director of its Institute for Global Health & Infectious Diseases, told PolitiFact that while there is research suggesting that fever can defend against infection, \"it is extremely difficult to relate the magnitude of fever to the severity of infection, or to demonstrate the benefits of fever for any given microorganism,\" including the COVID-19 virus.\u00a0\nThe body\u2019s immune response is the most important factor in killing the virus, said Dr. Wilbur Chen, an infectious disease physician-scientist at the University of Maryland. \"The fever response is just one of the symptoms that are experienced when the immune response is revved up when fighting the virus. It is like what smoke is to fire\u2014the point is that you are not focusing your concern on putting out the smoke; you want to put out the fire,\" he said.\nSaid Watanabe: \"The caveat here is how heat-tolerant is COVID-19? That is, as far as I am aware, an unanswered question. There are viruses that are relatively heat-tolerant, so your body\u2019s fever defense may not be effective.\"\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post advises that generally healthy people \"experiencing mild to moderate respiratory symptoms with or without a COVID-19 diagnosis\" should \"let your fever run high\" to kill a coronavirus.\nGenerally speaking, a fever under 103 degrees doesn\u2019t necessarily need treatment. But that depends on other factors, such as age, underlying health conditions and other symptoms.\u00a0\nHigher temperatures and persistent fevers are dangerous. And it isn\u2019t yet known whether a fever might help the body fight the novel coronavirus, as it does other viruses.\nThe advice on letting a fever run high to fight the coronavirus, even with generally healthy people and mild to moderate respiratory symptoms, is too broad.
