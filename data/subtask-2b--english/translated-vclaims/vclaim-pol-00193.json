Samuel Sinyangwe, co-founder of the Zero Campaign, an activist group focused on police violence, said in a viral tweet from August 30, cited by anchor Chuck Todd of the NBC newspaper \"Meet the Press.\" America has a number of conservatives who wear more black face than black conservatives. https://t.co/VHq1Cl4Xkl - Samuel Siniangwey (@samswey) 30 August 2019 This allegation was easily verified: There is no black governor of the 50 states. But there are two governors who apologized for wearing a black face. The Seinangwe tweet followed a report issued on 29 August by the Alabama Government. Kay Ivy apologized after the sound of a 52-year-old radio interview in which she spoke of wearing a black face to a comic student at the University of Oburn. In February, Virginia Goff. Ralph Northam said that he was one of two men photographed in the form of an annual racist book from 1984, which showed a man wearing one black face and another in Ko Klux Klan's robe. At that time, Northam didn't say any costume he was wearing. But then he rejected his apology, saying he wasn't anyone in the picture. No investigation conducted by the School of Medicine in Eastern Virginia, where Northam obtained a medical certificate, concluded whether Northam was in the picture from his 1984 annual book. \"With regard to the picture on the Hollow. On Northam's personal page, we couldn't conclusively identify either of the photographers, \"the final report said. \"The Governor himself made inconsistent public statements in this regard.\" When Northam said the investigation \"I confirmed what I said all the time, that I'm not in the picture,\" we mistakenly assessed his statement. And depending on whether you're counting Northham, there's at least one governor who's probably got a black face in the past. He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. \u2022 On January 12, 2021, at the same time, there are currently no black governors, according to the Rutgers University Center for American Governor. Of the 50 governors sitting, 47 are white, the remaining three are of Spanish origin, and Asian and Native Americans. Only African-Americans were elected Governor, the most recent of which was the Democratic Deval Patrick, who voted to take office in Massachusetts in 2006. The former Governor of Virginia, Douglas Wilder, was elected by the Democrat from 1990 to 1994. Before Wilder was elected, the only black governor was P.P. S. Pensbach, who applied as Governor of Louisiana for 34 days in 1872, while the Governor faced dismissal, according to CBS News. In 2008, David Patterson was also appointed Governor of New York following the resignation of Elliot Speitzer. The Democrats Stacey Abrams, Andrew Gillum and Ben Gyoron, all black, lost the Governor's races in Georgia, Florida and Maryland in 2018. \"When many African Americans start their political lives, they often run in places with large or increasing numbers of African Americans,\" said Andra Gilsby, Professor of Political Science at Emory University. \"In view of the fact that no State has a majority of the black population, this is a challenge.\" This is why black candidates have been more successful in getting elected mayors of cities or congressmen from urban areas with large black populations, as John Wyngart, the director of the Center in the United States Governor, said. He added: \"In the case of Deval Patrick, the elected governors were certainly considered successful.\" \"So it's not like getting one in necessarily opening the door.\" Gillespie said that there are still many white-majority jurisdictions that have put black politicians in various offices, but \"historical rule\" is that black candidates are the best when black voters have access to the ballot boxes. This was not possible in most American history. \"Almost 100 years after the protection of black voting rights under the 15th Amendment, a number of states where African Americans lived came in creative ways to prevent African Americans from exercising their right to vote,\" said Gilsby. \"What he did was shut down a chance for black people to be able to run for office.\" In an e-mail to Politifact, Siniangoi observed that the Governor of the United States Virgin Islands, Albert Brian, was black. The United States Virgin Islands is a Territory rather than a State. \"America has more rulers than those wearing a black face than black rulers,\" said Governor Sinyangwe. There are currently no black governors in the United States. But there was at least one person, Ivy, who admitted that he was wearing a black face in the past, and Northam was accused of the same thing. We're assessing this statement right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00193"}
