(Nielsen resigned in April 2019.) It was taken by photographer Jim Lo Scalzo for the European Pressphoto Agency on June 20, 2018, when Trump signed an executive order halting his policy of separating migrant children from their parents at the U.S. border. The photo\u00a0was featured by many news sites at the time.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe story, which lampoons aspects of Islam, is also fake and was copied from a satire site.
