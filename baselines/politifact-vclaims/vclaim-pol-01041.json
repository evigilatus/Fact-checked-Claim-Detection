(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nClose (and not-so-close) readers will have realized that undocumented immigrants don\u2019t have citizenship in the United States.\nWe reached out to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to ask whether Carson, who was sworn in to lead the department in March 2017, ever said \"illegal immigrants caught voting should be stripped of their citizenship.\" A spokesman for the agency said did not respond to PolitiFact\u2019s email. He also did not answer PolitiFact\u2019s questions about a column Carson wrote in\u00a02014.\nWe discovered the column after searching and failing to find a legitimate source of the statement. While Carson doesn\u2019t say in the column what this post attributes to him, there is similarity.\n\"Anyone caught involved in voter fraud should be immediately deported and have his citizenship revoked,\" wrote Carson, who went on to launch a 2016 bid for the Republican nomination for president. MSNBC, among others, pounced. \"Ben Carson: Strip citizenship from non-citizens who vote,\" the headline on the Nov. 13, 2014, story said before wondering about the logic behind Carson\u2019s idea. \"If these are non-citizens, as the context suggests, how can they have their citizenship revoked? If they\u2019re citizens, where are they being deported to?\"\nThe MSNBC story cites a column WND.com published on Nov. 11, 2014: \"A common-sense prescription for immigration reform.\" When we visited the website on Feb. 5, the line was no longer in the column. However, it also appears in Carson\u2019s 2015 book, \"What I Believe: A Collection of My Syndicated Columns,\" under the title \"As Long as U.S. Leaders Game the System So Will Illegals.\" \u00a0\nLet\u2019s look at the sentence in context.

We do need a continual flow of immigrants, but choosers need not be beggars. We make decisions based on our needs. People who refuse to comply with the rules must forfeit chances of legalization in the future. Anyone caught involved in voter fraud should be immediately deported and have his citizenship revoked. The point is this: we must create a system that disincentivizes illegal immigration and upholds the rules of law while providing us with a steady stream of immigrants from other nations who will strengthen our society.\"\nNo states run their elections exactly the same, but across the country, citizenship is a requirement to to vote in U.S. elections. Noncitizens, including permanent legal residents, cannot vote. Depending on the state, people with felony convictions or people who are mentally incapacitated can\u2019t vote either.\nOur ruling\nAs far as we can tell, Ben Carson never said \"illegal immigrants caught voting should be stripped of their citizenship,\" as the Facebook post claims.\nHe did say that someone involved in voter fraud should lose their citizenship and be deported. But there\u2019s enough ambiguity in his words that it\u2019s possible to interpret them multiple ways.\nHe could have meant that naturalized citizens should lose their citizenship if they engage in voter fraud, though barring other circumstances\u2014if they have a felony conviction in some states and voted anyway, for example\u2014casting a ballot wouldn\u2019t be illegal on its own.\nHe could have meant that Americans who commit voter fraud should lose their citizenship, though it\u2019s unclear where they would be sent should they be deported.\nAnd because he espouses his idea in a column about illegal immigration, he could have meant what the Facebook post says: That undocumented immigrants who commit voter fraud should lose their citizenship (though they wouldn\u2019t have citizenship if they were undocumented immigrants).\nThe Facebook post assumes that\u2019s what he meant\u2014it\u2019s not clear from his column\u2014and goes one step farther, attributing to Carson what appears to be a made-up quote.\nWe rate this statement Mostly False.\n\u00a0\n Share the Facts 2019-02-08 20:30:33 UTC   PolitiFact    3 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly False  Ben Carson said \"illegal immigrants caught voting should be stripped of their citizenship.\"    Facebook post On the internet     Sunday, February 3, 2019 2019-02-03    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01041"}
