Jon Tester, D-Mont., in a Facebook ad that featured a Montanan with a pre-existing condition. \"I\u2019ve fought to protect coverage for pre-existing conditions, but Matt Rosendale supports plans that don\u2019t have to cover them.\"\nIt turns out Rosendale has backed such plans.\nShort-term plans\nPresident Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers\u2019 rejiggering of the health care market has led to an increase of cheaper plans with fewer benefits.\nIn August, the Trump administration issued a rule to permit insurance companies to extend the lifespan of short-term insurance plans.\nThese so-called \"short-term, limited-duration\" plans, which were originally designed to fill temporary gaps in coverage for up to three months, are exempt from the pre-existing coverage rule. Under Trump, temporary plans can now last up to 364 days, and may be renewed up to three times.\nRepublican lawmakers, meanwhile, voted to remove a tax penalty that Affordable Care Act applied to Americans who chose not to carry comprehensive coverage. The penalty drops off starting in 2019.\nThese two measures opened the door for consumers to drop coverage altogether, or to buy \"short term\" plans, without penalty, that may be renewable up to three years and do not have to cover pre-existing conditions.\nAbsent the pre-existing coverage provision, insurers have more leeway in crafting this class of insurance policy. Companies on the short-term market may choose not to insure, or not to renew, an applicant due to health conditions. Or they may charge higher premiums based on health status, gender or other factors.\n\"Carriers offering short-term or limited duration plans may say that they will cover someone that has pre-existing conditions,\" said Katherine Hempstead, a senior advisor at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. \"But then they will actually waive coverage for any health services related to those conditions.\" \u00a0\nInsurance companies may also investigate a policyholder\u2019s claim of illness or injury and make a retroactive finding that their ailment stemmed from a pre-existing condition, and therefore excluded from coverage.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

But they did not specifically address how Rosendale would ensure people with pre-existing conditions are not denied coverage.\nAn editorial in Montana\u2019s largest newspaper, the Billings Gazette, took Rosendale to task for claiming to support protections for those with pre-existing conditions while endorsing short-term plans.\nThe newspaper cited a study that estimated that a quarter of non-elderly Montana adults have a pre-existing condition that could disqualify them from coverage plans that do not comply with Obamacare.\n\"As the state\u2019s insurance commissioner, Rosendale should know that the policies he supports do opposite of what he promised,\" the editorial read. \"He promotes the short-term policies that can reject Montanans who have pre-existing health conditions.\"\nOur ruling\nTester said, \"Matt Rosendale supports plans that don\u2019t have to cover (pre-existing conditions).\"\nRosendale supports short-term plans that do not have to cover pre-existing conditions, and he welcomed their expansion under Trump.\nWe rate this True.\n Share the Facts 2018-10-31 15:56:10 UTC   PolitiFact    6 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: True  \"Matt Rosendale supports plans that don\u2019t have to cover (pre-existing conditions).\"    Jon Tester Sen., D-Mont. https://www.facebook.com/jontester/videos/2445972935427806/   in an ad Wednesday, October 10, 2018 2018-10-10    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01355"}
