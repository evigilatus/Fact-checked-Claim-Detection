Kane Coxinelli, recently named the United States. The Acting Director of Citizenship and Immigration Services spoke to the hosting of Dana Berneau on July 7, in Fox News Sunday, of the naturalization process for immigrants and described the celebration, which had culminated in \"a very impressive experience.\" \"How many of these people a year let America in now?\" Berneau asked. \"Well, last year, we were in the range of 850,000 and that was the highest in five years. In this fiscal year we will go beyond that, \"Coxinelli said. \"People who come after the president and this administration, they say, \"Oh you know, you don't like immigrants.\" Well, we let people become citizens more than in years.\" Berneau said she didn't think people knew that. \"No, they don't,\" respond Cuchneli. Is it true that immigrants have become more American citizens than in previous years? In total numbers, yes. However, the approval rate has not been the highest in recent years. And the number Cochinel mentioned is amplifier. In general, before they become naturalized American citizens, migrants must pay fees, pass a citizenship test, check their background, obtain legal permanent residence for at least five years, and meet other criteria. The final step in becoming an American citizen is to take loyalty to the United States at the naturalization ceremony. Poletti Fuckett asked for data to support Cochinelli &apos; s claim that Trump &apos; s administration allowed more people to become citizens than in previous years. In 2018, the Association approved some 756,800 applications for naturalization. This was dominated by approval figures in 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014. The last time consents to naturalization were higher than 2018 in 2013 - about 779,900. On February 1, 2021, Tom Cotton mentioned in an interview with Fox and friends \"Many of these arriving immigrants, we have no way of checking their background for either health or security.\" \u2022 3 February 2021 in the Fox News interview on Sunday, when asked how many people had been recruited, Cochinelli said \"We are in the range of 850,000\" in 2018. However, this figure refers to completed applications - both approved and rejected. Some 849,500 applications were completed in 2018, according to the report of the Commonwealth of Independent States in the United States. The approvals for naturalization in 2018 - 756,800 - were not much higher than in 2016, the last full financial year of the Obama administration. In 2016, approximately 753,100 people were naturalized. This represents an increase of less than 1 per cent in absolute numbers of naturalization from 2016 to 2018. The report sent by the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) to Poletti Fruitte was not only a total number of persons who had become American citizens, but also approval rates. In fiscal years 2017 and 2018, the approval rate was 89 per cent. In 2016, 90%. Therefore, while the total number of persons approved in 2018 is higher than in five years, the consent rate is not. \"We're letting more people become citizens than in previous years,\" said the governor, \"and they were 850,000 last year. This represents the amount of 850,000 completed applications - both approved and rejected. In fiscal year 2018, some 800,756 people became United States citizens. This is the highest figure since 2013, when it was about 779,900. Of all naturalization applications completed in 2018, 89 per cent were approved. The same percentage was in 2017. In 2016, 90 per cent of applications were approved. The Cochinelli statement is partially accurate. We value it half right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00440"}
