Police cited witness saying otherwise.", "text": "Nearly a month after a police report surfaced on his 1998 arrest for driving while intoxicated, Democratic U.S. Senate nominee Beto O\u2019Rourke fielded a follow-up question during his Sept. 21, 2018 debate with Republican Sen. Ted Cruz.\nGromer Jeffers of the Dallas Morning News said to O\u2019Rourke: \"You have addressed your 1998 DWI arrest numerous times during your public career. But not this question: As the Houston Chronicle pointed out recently, a witness said in that accident that you tried to leave the scene of the accident. Did you and should voters be concerned about this incident?\"\nO\u2019Rourke replied at the Southern Methodist University debate: \"I did not try to leave the scene of the accident--though driving drunk, which I did, is a terrible mistake for which there is no excuse or justification or defense and I will not try to provide one. I can only tell you that I was able to have a second chance in my life.\"\nO\u2019Rourke went on to tick-tock his subsequent opening of a business with friends in his hometown of El Paso where, he said, he met his wife with whom he\u2019s raising three children. Also, O\u2019Rourke said, he won election to the El Paso City Council and, in 2012, to the U.S. House, which he\u2019s leaving after this year.\n\"I made the most that I could with my second choice and my opportunity,\" O\u2019Rourke said.\nReaders asked us if O\u2019Rourke tried to leave the scene of his accident and arrest.\nHouston Chronicle news story cites police report\nThe Chronicle, in an Aug. 30, 2018, news story, said a police report shows that the incident was a more serious threat to public safety than previously reported.\nThe newspaper, citing the report, said that O\u2019Rourke was driving drunk at what a witness called \"a high rate of speed\" in a 75 mph zone on Interstate 10 about a mile east of the New Mexico border. He lost control and hit a truck, sending his car careening across the center median. The story said that the witness, described as stopping at the scene, later told police that O\u2019Rourke had tried to leave the scene.\nThe report, the story says, refers to\u00a0an unnamed\u00a0\"motorist\u2019s description of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s dark-colored Volvo passing him quickly about 3 a.m. on I-10.\" The story says that O'Rourke reportedly struck a truck going in the same direction and crossed a grassy median into the opposite lanes.\nThe story says that according to the police report, \"O\u2019Rourke then attempted to leave the scene but was stopped by the same motorist he had just passed. The unidentified motorist \u2018then turned on his overhead lights to warn oncoming traffic and to try to get the defendant (O\u2019Rourke) to stop,\u2019 the report says.\"\nThe story says that O'Rourke recorded a 0.136 and 0.134 on police breathalyzers, above a blood-alcohol level of 0.10, the state legal limit at the time. He was arrested at the scene, the story said, and charged with DWI, but completed a court-approved diversion program and had the charges dismissed, post-arrest developments we confirmed for a previous fact-check confirming the September 1998 arrest and a previous one, when O\u2019Rourke was a college student, for getting past a fence to enter the University of Texas at El Paso campus in the wee hours.\nPolice agency confirms report's authenticity\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 23, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBiden invested the entire family fortune in Ukraine gas and oil. Then shuts down Keystone pipeline. Starting to get the picture.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy email, we asked the Anthony Police Department to review the 12-page partially-redacted police report posted next to the Chronicle story. In response, a department officer, Linda Hartt-Goggin, said the posted report \"appears to be a true redacted copy of the original report.\"\nHartt-Goggin said by phone she couldn\u2019t find the department\u2019s report on the accident itself. She speculated that it was lost when a room was flooded.\nAccording to APD Investigator Richard Carrera\u2019s report, filed three days after the accident, O\u2019Rourke said after his 3 a.m. arrest that he\u2019d been driving to Los Alamos in New Mexico. The officer\u2019s report says that he met at the scene with a witness--called the \"reporter\" in Carrera\u2019s report--and his partner, the driver of \"the American Medical ambulance.\" By phone, Hartt-Goggin told us the ambulance company serves private clients out of Las Cruces, NM. Our attempts to reach a Las Cruces official with American Medical Response, a Colorado-based company, didn\u2019t draw an immediate response.\nCarrera\u2019s report says the witness said that he initially saw a green Volvo pass his vehicle at a high rate of speed westbound on I-10. \"The vehicle then lost control moments later and struck a truck traveling the same direction,\" the report says. \"After the driver/defendant struck the truck, it sent the defendant\u2019s vehicle across the center median and to a complete stop facing east bound,\" the report says.\n\"The defendant/driver then attempted to leave the scene,\" the report says. But the witness \"turned on his overhead lights to warn oncoming traffic and to get the defendant to stop.\"\nThe report says that when the officer engaged O\u2019Rourke in conversation, he wasn\u2019t understandable due to slurred speech. The report says the officer asked O\u2019Rourke to step out of the vehicle and \"upon doing so the defendant almost fell to the floor,\" the report says.\nSeparately, the Austin American-Statesman asked the Texas Department of Public Safety for\u00a0agency reports on file about the incident. M.L. Calcote said in a September 2018 letter sent by email that the agency didn\u2019t have responsive records.\nO'Rourke stands by debate statement\nWe asked O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign about the witness telling Carrera that\u00a0O\u2019Rourke tried to leave the accident scene. By email, Chris Evans said O\u2019Rourke stands by what he said at the debate about not trying to leave. Evans noted that the \"police report shows he was arrested for a DWI, not for leaving or attempting to leave the scene.\"\nOur ruling\nO\u2019Rourke said he didn\u2019t try to leave the scene of his 1998 DWI accident and arrest.\nRecords indicate O\u2019Rourke was arrested at the scene and wasn\u2019t charged with trying to flee. But the September 1998 Anthony Police Department report on the incident says a witness said O\u2019Rourke tried to leave the scene before police arrived and the witness kept him from doing so.\nWe rate this claim Mostly False.\n\nMOSTLY FALSE \u2013 The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.
