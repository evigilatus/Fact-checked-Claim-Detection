Greg Steube, R-Sarasota, disagreed with testimony against the bill from Austin Engelbrecht, a lobbyist for Florida State University.\nEngelbrecht said Oregon law allows students to bring guns on campuses, but it was still the police, not a gun owner, who stopped\u00a0the Umpqua attack. Steube responded that\u00a0guns were not allowed at Oregon schools.\n\"Oregon is a gun-free zone. The state of Oregon allows each university the ability to decide for themselves whether it's a gun-free zone or not,\" Steube said. \"The community college where the shooting occurred was a gun-free zone. Don't believe me, look it up on your cell phones.\"\nWe decided to\u00a0figure out whether Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore., allowed guns on its campus or not.\nException to the rule\nChristopher Harper-Mercer, a 26-year-old enrolled at Umpqua, killed eight students and an assistant professor and injured nine others before police arrived and wounded him in a shootout on Oct. 1, 2015. Harper-Mercer then killed himself, ending the deadliest mass shooting in Oregon\u2019s modern history.\nSome gun rights advocates said the shooting could have been prevented if campuses weren\u2019t gun-free zones \u2014 that is, the schools restrict students, teachers or anyone else from having a gun on school property. Steube used the shooting as an example of why HB 4001 is necessary, citing an Umpqua policy that bars guns from campus and therefore exposed students to danger.\nThe school\u2019s student code of conduct lists the \"possession or use, without written authorization, of firearms,\" among other weapons and dangerous chemicals or devices, on college property or at college-sponsored events as a punishable offense. There\u2019s a similar policy spelled out on Umpqua\u2019s website.\nThe clause \"without written authorization\" is important.\nThere is a policy prohibiting guns at Umpqua Community College, as Steube said. But students are allowed to have guns on campus if they have a concealed carry permit \u2014 essentially what Steube\u2019s HB 4001 wants to codify in Florida.\nHis bill, which cleared the committee process to be heard in the 2016 legislative session, would apply to all colleges and universities, which would not be able to restrict concealed carry permit holders from carrying guns.\nWhile the Oregon University System banned guns in the 1970s, a concealed weapons law from 1989 said only the state\u2019s Legislature can make rules on gun possession. The law was at the center of a challenge by a Western Oregon University student who was suspended in 2009 for bringing a concealed handgun on campus. The student had a permit for the gun.\nThe Oregon Court of Appeals ruled in 2011 that the university system\u2019s ban was beyond its authority and was invalid, so concealed carry permit holders could bring weapons on campus. (Having the gun out in the open was still not allowed.) Oregon is currently one of eight states that allow students to carry concealed handguns on postsecondary campuses \u2014 the others are Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Mississippi, Utah, Wisconsin and Texas, which recently passed a bill that takes effect in August 2016.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharlie Crist\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2010 in a news release\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Speaker Rubio supported gun restrictions that included background checks and waiting periods.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Lee Logan \u2022 February 26, 2010\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLegally speaking, community colleges can neither arm their own security guards nor remove people with guns from campus. On Nov. 9, Umpqua began paying for an armed sheriff\u2019s deputy to act as armed security, because the school couldn\u2019t directly hire an armed guard.\nSteube acknowledged the 2011 Oregon court ruling to PolitiFact Florida, but he said schools are now allowed to set their own policies prohibiting weapons.\n\"I stated in committee that state law allows (concealed) carry in Oregon but the school banned guns,\" Steube told PolitiFact Florida via email. \"My statement was an accurate reflection of the law and policy.\"\nThe State Board of Higher Education in 2012 did create a policy that banned students, employees, contractors, ticketholders to university events and people renting university property from carrying guns on university property, according to The Oregonian newspaper. If someone had a concealed carry permit, they could bring the gun on campus, but he or she could not take it into a building or sports venue. There were exceptions for police, ROTC members, people in off-campus housing, and shooting and hunting clubs.\nBut keep in mind, that policy was for the state\u2019s seven universities, not its 17 community colleges. Their governing boards each set their own rules. Umpqua\u2019s ban on guns doesn\u2019t prevent students with a valid concealed weapons permit from bringing guns on campus.\nUmpqua Community College spokeswoman Anne Marie Levis told us the school\u2019s gun-free policy didn\u2019t apply to students with a valid permit.\n\"UCC was never designated as a \u2018gun-free zone\u2019 by any signage or policy,\" she said. \"Umpqua Community College does comply with state law by allowing students with concealed carry licenses to bring firearms on campus.\"\nIt has been widely reported that students with firearms were on the Umpqua campus on the day Harper-Mercer attacked. One particularly harrowing account included the experience of student John Parker, an Army veteran who was carrying a concealed handgun on Oct. 1.\n\"When I got into the room that was locked down, one of the professors asked if anyone was concealed carry,\" Parker told Reuters. \"I raised my hand and said: \u2018Don\u2019t worry, nobody is coming through that door.\u2019 \"\nParker was in a building away from the shooting. He told MSNBC that a professor convinced him to stay put lest he be targeted by the shooter or mistaken for the suspect by police responding to 911 calls.\nOur ruling\nSteube said Oregon\u2019s Umpqua Community College \"was a gun-free zone.\"\nThe school does have a policy generally prohibiting firearms on campus. However, Oregon law allows for students with valid concealed carry permits to bring guns on school grounds with some restrictions.\nAn Umpqua official confirmed that students with concealed carry licenses are allowed to bring them on campus in compliance with state law, just as Steube wants to see in Florida.\nSteube\u2019s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05682"}
