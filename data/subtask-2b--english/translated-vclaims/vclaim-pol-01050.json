In response, a strong security wall was built. He claimed that this powerful barrier had almost ended illegal crossings.\" In view of the numerous arguments in favour and opposition to the Trump border wall, we decided to verify the truth in the second part of the President's claim that the San Diego barrier \"has almost completely ended the illegal crossings.\" Was it the barrier that led to this dramatic change? Or have other factors helped to limit illegal entry? We've begun to verify the truth. We rightly urged the President about the tragic landing at illegal border crossings, which are measured by the arrests of border patrols. The arrests in the San Diego sector fell by 96 per cent from some 630,000 in 1986 to 26,000 in 2017, according to Associated Press. The largest decline occurred in the late 1990s, several years after the construction of the first border fence in San Diego. However, illegal entry across the entire southern border, not only in San Diego, has been declining for almost two decades. The number of such persons fell from more than 1.5 million in 2000 to less than 500,000 in 2018, according to The New York Times. On the basis of these news reports, in addition to interviews with border experts and a 2007 report by the Congressional Research Service, Politifak California found that the San Diego fence was not the only reason for the dramatic decline in illegal crossings. \"It's not just the fence,\" said Victor Clarke-Alvaro, a professor of Latin American studies at San Diego State University. \"It concerns employment opportunities (expanded) in Mexico, related to the letter from Trump.\" The federal government \"also increased technology and personnel\" added Paula Avila, Vice-President of International Business Affairs at the San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce. \"You must see the whole picture.\" The White House did not respond when asked about the Trump statement. Marco Rubio says on January 27, 2021 in his remarks: \"Only in the Third World do you see this routine use of trials of former leaders.\" The 2007 research team report found that migrants succeeded in crossing the initial fence in San Diego in the early 1990s, or in some cases passed it. This led to the construction of a three-tier fence, more than double the number of border patrol personnel and increased the technology used to stop illegal entry operations. \"Though much of this reduction in fears at those stations and in the San Diego sector may have been due to the construction of the triple wall,\" said the report, \"the sector has also seen an increase in other resources that may be attributed to part of the decline. For example, the number of agents employed in the San Diego sector increased significantly during this period - from 980 in 1993 to 2,274 in 1998. In addition, the number of underground sensors deployed in the San Diego sector almost tripled from 1993 to 1998, and the vehicle fleet increased by more than 150 per cent during the same period.\" In an e-mail, David Sherk, Professor of Political Science and International Relations at the University of San Diego, said that additional physical barriers in San Diego helped to reduce illegal crossings. But the rapid increase in border operatives also played a key role, as Sherk said, by transforming \"immigrants into other crossing points east of San Diego, in the most dangerous mountain and desert areas, causing thousands of people to die from exposure to elements over the past 25 years.\" Avila, from the San Diego Regional Chamber, mentioned another piece of the border image: tunnels. Dozens of completed tunnels had been discovered under the borders of San Diego in recent decades, which could distort the number of illegal crossings and the idea that dueling alone prevented unauthorized migration. Our boss Trump claimed that San Diego's border fence nearly ended illegal crossings. He is right that the arrests of border patrols have declined, down 96 per cent along the San Diego sector, from 1986 to 2017. The largest decline occurred in the late 1990s, after a three-tier barrier replaced the First Shid fence in 1993. However, the border experts, together with a congressional report, show that the San Diego border fence was only one factor in helping to reduce crossings. The increase in the number of border patrol personnel, vehicles and technology as well as the improvement of economic opportunities in Mexico have played important roles. The Trump statement ignores these key factors, giving credit only to the barrier. We value his claim half right. The truth is now - the statement is partially accurate, but it ignores important details or leaves things out of context.
