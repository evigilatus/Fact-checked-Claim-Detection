Last year the Milken Institute ranked San Antonio as the nation's top-performing local economy.\"\n\nCastro made the same claim in his keynote at the Texas Democratic Party convention. In that June 8, 2012, speech -- which we\u2019ve previously dipped into twice -- Juli\u00e1n Castro said his city\u2019s investments in infrastructure and education paid off \"late last year when San Antonio was ranked as the top-performing local economy by the Milken Institute.\"\n\nIndeed, we confirmed, San Antonio topped Milken\u2019s 2011 list of the nation\u2019s best-performing large metropolitan areas, rocketing up from 14th place the year before. Its rise is part of a recent trend in which Texas cities have dominated the list as the nation recovers from the 2007-09 recession.\n\nThe economic think tank\u2019s annual list, which Milken spokesman Conrad Kiechel told us by phone has been issued in its current form for \"more than a decade,\" was described in a Dec. 30, 2011, Texas Tribune news story as \"a ranking that measures American metropolitan areas based on their ability to create and sustain jobs.\"\n\nMilken\u2019s 2011 report on the best-performing cities says the index gives priority to job and pay gains, then some weight to several technology measures in relation to national averages: the local growth in high-tech gross domestic product, the concentration of tech industries and how many of 25 specific tech industries are concentrated there. Some measures are weighed across five-year spans, to flatten out extreme swings, and the most recent year, \"to capture recent momentum.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nIn recent years, the Tribune said, \"companies have flocked to San Antonio, making it an economic center rivaling Houston and Dallas.\" In contrast to those cities, though, \"San Antonio has attracted high-wage jobs, capitalizing on its booming medical research industry.\"\n\nThe Tribune story said InCube and Medtronic were the latest bioscience companies to move to San Antonio, which was already home to global headquarters for Valero Energy, Clear Channel Communications, USAA insurers and the H-E-B grocery chain.\n\nThe San Antonio Express-News credited the city\u2019s rise to reasons \"including military base realignment, drilling in the Eagle Ford Shale and the growth of health care\" in a Dec. 16, 2011, news story.\n\nTexas cities held four of the top five spots on Milken\u2019s 2011 big-cities list, with Austin/Round Rock at fourth. Back in 2008, Austin was Texas\u2019 only top-five city, but the state claimed most of those slots in 2009, 2010 and 2011. The other chart-toppers for 2011 were No. 2, El Paso; No. 3, Fort Collins/Loveland, Colo.; and No. 5, Killeen/Temple/Fort Hood.\n\nTexas\u2019 rise in the ranks, the Express-News wrote, came partly because of downturns in other parts of the country. The story quoted research economist James Gaines of Texas A&M University\u2019s Real Estate Center: \"Our growth rate and advancement isn't all that wonderful. We've managed to stay flat or have very small positives. But because everybody has so many negatives, we look so much better.\"\n\nA Philadelphia Inquirer columnist interviewed Milken\u2019s chief research officer, Ross DeVol, and wrote Dec. 16, 2011 that \"Technology and energy explain why nine Texas cities placed in the top 25 of the 2011 Milken ranking.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nSan Antonio hasn\u2019t just been holding steady in the economic downturn; it\u2019s been gaining ground, even compared to other Texas cities.
