Period.\"\nThere are a few angles to consider here.\nDid LaPierre say those words?\nYes, he did. It was May 1, 1999, 10 days after two teenage boys killed 13 people, wounded more than 20 others and then committed suicide at Columbine High School in Colorado. LaPierre spoke at the NRA\u2019s annual convention and called for a policy banning guns from school.\nBut LaPierre said more than what the Everytown group quoted.\nHe was talking about guns brought to school by students, not teachers or trained security.\n\"Of the 6,000 young people the president acknowledges were caught with a gun at school during the past two years, we believe all of them should have been prosecuted,\" LaPierre said. \"But the truth is only five were prosecuted in 1997. And just eight were prosecuted in 1988. That's not zero tolerance.\"\nLaPierre made a passing reference to armed guards in schools, referring to \"the rare exception of law enforcement officers or trained security personnel.\" As for arming teachers, something President Donald Trump has shown a keen interest in, LaPierre said nothing.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn his 1999 speech, his emphasis was on what adults should do to keep weapons out of the hands of teens. LaPierre said the NRA held adults responsible.\n\"Just as every kid should have a guardian who knows where he is and keeps him safe, every firearm should have a guardian who knows where it is and keeps it safely stored,\" LaPierre said.\nThe debate has shifted\nColumbine horrified the nation in its scale and the cold-blooded method of the high school seniors who had spent a year planning their attack. The Senate passed a bill to strengthen background checks, but it died in the House. The slaughter prompted more discussion of early identification of loners, and more emphasis on school security. Keeping weapons out of the hands of minors gained more attention.\nThe 2012 shootings in Newtown, Conn., that took the lives of 26 elementary students and one of their teachers was the signature event when LaPierre spoke forcefully about a good guy with a gun being the best response to a bad guy with a gun.\nHis rhetoric in 2012 was the same as when he spoke in 2018.\n\"American airports, office buildings, power plants, courthouses, even sports stadiums are all protected by armed security,\" LaPierre said at a news conference Dec. 21, 2012. \"Yet, when it comes to our most beloved, innocent, and vulnerable members of the American family, our children, we as a society leave them every day utterly defenseless.\"\nIn 2012, LaPierre called on Congress to immediately \"appropriate whatever is necessary to put armed police officers in every single school in this nation.\"\nOur ruling\nEverytown for Gun Safety tweeted the reminder that nearly two decades ago, LaPierre said, \"We believe in absolutely gun-free, zero-tolerance, totally safe schools. That means no guns in America\u2019s schools. Period.\"\nThe quotation is accurate, but it takes LaPierre\u2019s words out of context.\nHis full message was that adults should keep weapons out of the hands of minors and that schools and localities should act swiftly to punish any student caught bringing a firearm to school.\nIn 1999, LaPierre also left open the door for armed security on school grounds, but that was not the focus of the policy debate at the time. That option has since risen on the NRA\u2019s agenda.\nThe Everytown tweet has a measure of truth, but it leaves out important context that changes the meaning behind LaPierre\u2019s words.\nWe rate this claim Half True.
