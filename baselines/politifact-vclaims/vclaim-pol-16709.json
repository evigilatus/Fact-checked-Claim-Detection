Barry Loudermilk closed his remarks with a statement that drew its own headlines.\n\"Before you take this historic vote today, one week before Christmas, I want you to keep this in mind,\" the Georgia Republican said Dec. 18.\u00a0\n\"When Jesus was falsely accused of treason, Pontius Pilate gave Jesus the opportunity to face his accusers. During that sham trial, Pontius Pilate afforded more rights to Jesus than the Democrats have afforded this president in this process.\"\nThe comparison didn\u2019t stand up well among experts in religion and law.\nLoudermilk\u2019s evidence\nWe asked Loudermilk\u2019s press secretary, Brandon Cockerham, for information to back Loudermilk\u2019s statement, but didn\u2019t get a reply.\nThe Catholic News Agency reported that Cockerham defended the statement in an email to the news service, saying:\u00a0\n\"Congressman Loudermilk was simply making a comparison about the process; that Pontius Pilate allowed Jesus (to) face his accusers, but the Democrats refused to allow the president or Republicans to even know who the accuser was, much less the right to question him or her.\"\u00a0\nCockerham was alluding to the whistleblower, whose complaint about Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine triggered the impeachment proceedings. That person\u2019s identity has remained confidential.\u00a0\nBut Loudermilk didn\u2019t single out the whistleblower; rather, he alluded to multiple accusers.\nJesus\u2019 case\nSeveral passages from the New Testament of the Bible tell how Jesus appeared before Pontius Pilate, a Roman governor, before being crucified.\u00a0\nDuring Passover, Pilate freed any prisoner the people asked for. Jesus was accused of blasphemy and treason for stating he was the King of the Jews.\u00a0\nFrom Matthew Chapter 27, on the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops\u2019 website:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow Jesus stood before the governor, and he questioned him, \"Are you the king of the Jews?\"\u00a0Jesus said, \"You say so.\"\nAnd when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he made no answer.\nThen Pilate said to him, \"Do you not hear how many things they are testifying against you?\"\nBut he did not answer him one word, so that the governor was greatly amazed.\nJesus received no due process before Pilate, according to Robert Tuttle, professor of law and religion at George Washington University. \"He just questions Jesus and says he finds no fault, then asks the crowd what they want done.\"\nThe passages from the biblical books of Matthew (chapter 27), Mark (chapter 15) and Luke (chapter 23) \"pretty much agree on the story,\" said Douglas Laycock, a professor of law and religious studies at the University of Virginia.\n\"No one says that Jesus was offered a lawyer, or a chance to bring one, or a chance to call his own witnesses. No one said he could testify in writing if he didn't want to answer orally,\" Laycock told us. \"They say the priests and scribes made accusations; no one says that any witnesses were called to support those accusations. Pilate thought Jesus was innocent, but the mob demanded his execution and Pilate finally acquiesced.\"\nTrump\u2019s case\nThe House\u2019s impeachment proceedings were akin to an investigation by the police, a prosecutor or a grand jury \u2014 and due process rights are not granted. Trump\u2019s trial will be in the Senate.\nTrump was not denied a fair hearing, said Michael Gerhardt, author of \"Impeachment: What Everyone Needs to Know\" and a University of North Carolina professor of law who testified before Congress in support of impeaching Trump. \"He was invited but declined, and still had his bully pulpit.\"\nAllan Lichtman, author of \"The Case for Impeachment\" (from April 2017) and a history professor at American University, said Trump\u2019s supporters in the House and their attorneys could have cross-examined witnesses, Trump declined an invitation to present a defense before the Judiciary Committee, and he blocked witnesses from appearing.\n\"The only comparison between these two proceedings is that they both pretty much refused to defend themselves in the actual tribunal,\" Laycock said.\nOur ruling\nLoudermilk said, \"When Jesus was falsely accused of treason, Pontius Pilate gave Jesus the opportunity to face his accusers. During that sham trial, Pontius Pilate afforded more rights to Jesus than the Democrats have afforded this president in this process.\"\nBiblical accounts cited to us by experts in law and religion say Jesus was questioned by the Roman governor, not given an opportunity by Pilate to face his accusers. Trump has yet to go on trial in the Senate. But before being impeached by the House, he was given the opportunity to present a defense.\nWe rate Loudermilk\u2019s statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16709"}
