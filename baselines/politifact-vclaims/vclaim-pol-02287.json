Regarding the first six, Dallet campaign manager Jessica Lovejoy told us Dallet \"has not shied away from talking about her common Wisconsin values of equality, fairness, clean air and water, and good schools. She does not advocate for specific policies to advance these values.\"\nAs we\u2019ll see, in the first three statements, Dallet singled out mass incarceration, the environment and fighting \"right-wing special interests\" as issues that she said need to be addressed, though she didn\u2019t advocate for specific policies.\n1. I\u2019m not going to apologize for standing up for safer communities and for victims. And I think that we can do that while also trying to address racial injustice and the problem of mass incarceration.\n2. Just look at our president and you have to worry about equal protection under the law. Women are under attack. We have to protect our environment.\n3. I believe we (Burns and her) share many of the same values, and I hope that we can unite Wisconsinites to fight against right-wing special interests and make our state Supreme Court work for the people again.\nBut in the next three statements in which Dallet\u00a0talked about her values, she went further.\nDallet talked about not making it more difficult to vote, alluding to the debate over whether Wisconsin\u2019s photo ID law makes it more difficult to vote; she attacked the National Rifle Association, which is known for its activism to protect gun-owner rights; and she flatly stated that sales of a particular gun should be outlawed.\n4. I believe in clean air and water, I believe in our public education system and I believe in working people. I think we need to ensure we increase participation in our voting system, not decrease it. I think we need to address racial and gender inequality head on, not sweep the vestiges of a racist and patriarchal system under the rug.\n5. That\u2019s why I took the #NoNRAMoney pledge. I will not accept money from an organization that puts profits above the lives of Americans. Will you join me today in pledging that we won\u2019t vote for any candidate who takes NRA money? nonramoney.org/voter-pledge #NRABoycott\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Why do you need that rifle that was used in that (Parkland, Fla.) school shooting? What was it, an AR-15? Who ever needs to fire off that many rounds in a minute? There is no reason for that gun. There is no basis for it. It\u2019s not a gun that should be sold in the United States. I mean, let\u2019s talk about reasonable gun control \u2026. I\u2019m not going to write that law, that\u2019s going to be our legislatures. But we should all -- I mean, I\u2019m a citizen just like everyone else -- we should all write our legislatures, tell them how we think and let them write those laws.\nRecusal rule\nOn the remaining two statements, Lovejoy told us that when Dallet speaks about changing policy, \"she's referencing the need to update the Supreme Court recusal policy that currently allows sitting justices,\" such as retiring Justice Michael Gableman, \"to remain on cases where a party spent significantly on their behalf in their election.\"\nHere are those Dallet statements:\n7. It is the time for women. It\u2019s a time for making sure we stand up and our rights are protected. And experience matters to get the policies we want to move forward and to protect our rights.\nThat statement was made during the concluding remarks of a campaign appearance. Dallet had begun her remarks talking about her experience as a prosecutor and judge, then she talked at length about the importance of the recusal rule, and then she spoke about the experience Screnock and Burns have, before concluding.\nIt could be argued that in making the \"policies we want\" statement, Dallet was echoing her remarks about recusals rather than making a general statement about the need \"get the policies we want.\"\nBut in the final statement, from a radio interview, it\u2019s harder to see the argument that Dallet was referring to recusals.\n8. All of the values that I talked about -- clean air and water, and equal protection, and women -- are under attack. \u00a0And, this is something we all feel and we all relate to. And I'm the candidate that is going to be able to protect those values at this critical time, and there is just too much at stake right now to have someone without the experience needed to advocate for the policies that need to be changed and to make sure to protect those values.\nDallet had been asked earlier in the interview about recusals. But she made the statement we cite when asked about about why she featured criticism of President Donald Trump in her first TV campaign ad.\nOur rating\nScrenock says Dallet \"has talked about her interest in advocating for policies that need to be changed to achieve her political objectives.\"\nDallet frequently says she is merely stating her values, such as equal rights or clean air and water, and often she singles out those issues without advocating for a particular policy position.\nBut on some occasions she has gone beyond that.\nFor example, after citing clean air and water, and equal protection as her values, she pledged to \"advocate for the policies that need to be changed.\" And she has advocated for addressing \"mass\" incarceration; increasing voter participation and not allowing the sale of AR-15 guns.\nWe rate Screnock statement\u2019s Mostly True.
