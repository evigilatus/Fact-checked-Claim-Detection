Wagner has received millions", "text": "It\u2019s all about following the money.\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ran an ad on the 2020 Priorities website calling out Missouri\u2019s 2nd District Rep. Ann Wagner. Among other claims, it asserted:\n\"Wagner\u2019s campaign has taken millions of dollars from special interests, more than almost anyone else in Congress.\"\nMoney plays an ever-growing role in politics, so it\u2019s worth looking into.\u00a0\nBehind the claim\nAccording to DCCC spokesperson Courtney Rice, Wagner received more than $3 million from corporate political action committees throughout her political career, which started in the 2012 election cycle when she was elected. In that same vein, Wagner also received more than $2 million \"from the broader financial industry,\" according to Rice.\nWe were directed to searches from MapLight and the Center for Responsive Politics, two non-partisan research groups that track campaign contributions, political donors and the influence of money on politics.\nAccording to MapLight, since 2011 Wagner received $3.1 million from \"corporate PACs,\" which MapLight defines as when a political action committee identifies its affiliation to a corporation in a \"statement of organization\" filed with the Federal Election Commission.\u00a0\nThe Center for Responsive Politics, also known by its website name OpenSecrets.org, tracks all kinds of PACs, and showed higher numbers. According to the center, Wagner received more than $6.4 million from a variety of PACs, including corporate political action committees. Of that $6.4 million, more than $2.6 million came from PACs affiliated with the finance, insurance and real estate industries.\nIn addition, she received:\u00a0\n\n\n$226,022 from registered lobbyists;\n\n\n$1.7 million from non-PAC sources in the finance, insurance or real estate industries;\n\n\n$547,291 from non-PAC law firms and lawyers.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden canceled the Keystone pipeline because Warren Buffett \u201cdonated $58 million\u201d to his campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWagner received $4.3 million from the financial/insurance/real estate sector, as coded by the Center for Responsive Politics from both individuals and political action committees.\nOut of the more than 1,500 U.S. representatives listed who have served between 1990 and 2020, Wagner ranked 82nd for most contributions received from this sector.\nThis is behind other politicians from Missouri, including U.S. Sen. Roy Blunt and U.S. Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer, who received more than $8 million and $5 million respectively during their terms in Congress.\nSenate Minority Leader Charles Schumer received the most money from the financial/insurance/real estate sector, over $28 million.\nIn the 2020 election cycle, Wagner received $668,560 from corporate PACs, according to MapLight.\nShe was No. 54 out of 435 members of the House when she received $56,471 from lobbyists this election cycle.\u00a0\nFellow Republican congressmen from Missouri \u2014\u00a0Billy Long, Jason Smith and Luetkemeyer \u2014\u00a0received more from lobbyists than Wagner in this cycle.\nFrom the financial/insurance/real service sector, Wagner was No. 20 out of all House members in this cycle as she received $1,137,674.\nOur ruling\nIn an ad, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said, \"Wagner\u2019s campaign has taken millions of dollars from special interests, more than almost anyone else in Congress.\"\nWe can break this claim down into two parts:\n\n\nWagner\u2019s campaign has received millions of dollars from special interests.\n\n\nThat amount received is more than almost anyone else in Congress.\n\n\nIt\u2019s true that Wagner\u2019s campaign has received millions of dollars from corporate political action committees, more than the majority of elected representatives and senators. MapLight and the Center for Responsive Politics both confirm this.\nHowever, a significant number of senators and representatives have received more than Wagner from special interest groups, both in this election cycle and over the course of their respective political careers. For these reasons, we rate this claim as Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18821"}
