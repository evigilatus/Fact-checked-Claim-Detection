Hillary Clinton is for open borders.\"\nClaiming that Clinton would create \"open borders\" suggests she would allow undocumented immigrants to travel freely or with very few restrictions between two countries.\nThat\u2019s not what Clinton has proposed. Clinton supported legislation in 2013 that included a path to citizenship (with conditions) and heightened border security.\nHowever, some experts argue that \"open borders\" doesn't necessarily mean no enforcement at all, but rather making it far easier for undocumented immigrants to stay here. Clinton does want to make it easier for many undocumented immigrants, but that\u2019s not the same as getting rid of enforcement or allowing people to enter and leave the United States without border control.\nWe were unable to locate a Giuliani spokesperson Monday night.\nClinton\u2019s proposal\nClinton and Trump have taken vastly different approaches on immigration, although they have both said they favor secure borders.\nDuring this campaign, Clinton has called for addressing immigration laws including a path to citizenship within her first 100 days. But she has also called for protecting borders and deporting criminals or those who pose threats.\n\"We need to secure our borders. I\u2019m for it, I voted for it, I believe in it, and we also need to deal with the families, the workers who are here, who have made contributions, and their children,\" she said in November. \"We can do more to secure our border, and we should do more to deal with the 11 or 12 million people who are here, get them out of the shadows.\"\nThis is pretty consistent with her view as a New York senator and secretary of state.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn her 2014 book Hard Choices, Clinton praised the 2013 immigration bill co-sponsored by a bipartisan group of senators including Marco Rubio of Florida. That bill included billions for border enforcement over a decade for new surveillance equipment and fencing along the Mexican border, as well as adding 20,000 border agents. That bill passed the Senate but never reached a vote in the House.\nClinton\u2019s immigration platform does not amount to open borders, Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, previously told PolitiFact Florida when we fact-checked a similar claim by Trump that we rated False.\nOpen borders existed before 1875, when there were no federal restrictions on emigrating to the country, he said. The United States had immigration restrictions from 1875 to 1924 without a border patrol, which was created in 1924.\nIt\u2019s wrong to conflate \"open borders\" with anything less than perfect enforcement of immigration laws, he said. It\u2019s also wrong to \"claim Clinton is for open borders while she has also supported massive increases in border security to better enforce our restrictive immigration laws.\"\nBut Clinton has said she wants to limit deportations to violent criminals, not deport children and end raids and round-ups and go further than President Barack Obama for DREAMers and their parents if legally possible \u2014 although that is in legal limbo after the U.S. Supreme Court deadlocked. That greatly expands who could avoid deportation in a Clinton White House.\nThose policies amount to less enforcement to supporters of reduced immigration, including Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, and Roy Beck, executive director of NumbersUSA.\nBeck has told PolitiFact that the term \"open borders\" is imprecise. However, if undocumented immigrants can \"stay as long as you don\u2019t commit a violent crime, that is pretty close to open borders. You don\u2019t have to give amnesty -- you can just not have a threat of deportation, and it allows people to stay.\"\nOur ruling\nGiuliani said, \"Hillary Clinton is for open borders.\"\nClinton supported a 2013 bill that would have invested billions in border security in addition to a path to citizenship. As a presidential candidate she has called for securing the border and targeting deportation to criminals and those who pose security threats. While her plan would make it easier for many undocumented immigrants to avoid deportation, that\u2019s not the same as allowing a free-for-all at the border and ending enforcement.\nWe rate this claim False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/cbe27e82-8435-4872-8e49-12f87464cb98", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04675"}
