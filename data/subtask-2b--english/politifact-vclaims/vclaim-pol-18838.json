He\u2019s yet to release. I\u2019ve released 22 years of my tax returns. You can go online and look. He hasn\u2019t released one.\"\u00a0\n\n\"He talks about corruption,\" Biden continued. \"What is he hiding?\"\nThe Democratic presidential nominee\u2019s 22-years claim is accurate. He has made it before, including ahead of the first presidential debate, when he made public his 2019 tax returns.\nThe American people deserve transparency from their leaders, it's why as of today, I've released 22 years of my tax returns. https://t.co/6fwL20fWeI\u2014 Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) September 29, 2020 \nThe Biden campaign website lists Biden\u2019s federal and state tax returns for 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2016. It also lists Biden\u2019s financial disclosure documents for 2020 and 2019 and the 2019 tax returns for his running mate, California Sen. Kamala Harris, and her husband.\nThe returns show Biden and his wife, Jill, paid nearly $288,000 in federal income taxes in 2019.\nRELATED: Biden\u2019s income sources aren\u2019t such a big mystery\nBiden\u2019s tax returns for the previous eight years, covering the rest of his two terms as Obama\u2019s vice president, can be found in archived press releases from the Obama White House. Those included tax returns released for 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012, 2011, 2010, 2009, and 2008.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsked for the remaining 10 years\u2019 worth of filings, the Biden campaign pointed to an archived Q&A from Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign website, which linked to many years of Biden\u2019s tax returns from his decades-long stint as a U.S. senator representing Delaware. The page included tax returns from 2007, 2006, 2005, 2004, 2003, 2002, 2001, 2000, 1999, and 1998.\u00a0\nThe 22 years of Biden\u00a0tax returns are also available as part of an archive maintained by Tax Notes.\nTrump has not released his tax returns, breaking a promise he made during his 2016 campaign. According to the New York Times, the former real estate mogul and reality TV star has vowed for nearly a decade to release his tax returns under different conditions, but he hasn\u2019t delivered.\nTrump is the only president or major-party presidential nominee in decades to keep his returns hidden from the public. Efforts by Congress and others to get hold of them have so far been unsuccessful.\nTrump has cited a pending Internal Revenue Service audit as reason for not publishing his tax returns. The IRS, however, has said nothing precludes a president from releasing tax returns while under audit \u2014 as President Richard Nixon did. Trump has also claimed, falsely, that his financial disclosures offer a more extensive picture of his finances.\u00a0\nIn recent years, the New York Times has obtained tax records and pieced together a more complete picture of Trump\u2019s tax history. In September, the Times reported that Trump paid $750 in federal income taxes in both 2017 and 2016, and none at all in several years before that.\u00a0\nTrump has provided no evidence to suggest that he\u2019s paid more in taxes than the Times found. Tax experts said the complex tax history depicted by the Times report shows unusually aggressive tax avoidance and exceptionally persistent losses.\u00a0\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\nOur ruling\nBiden said, \"I\u2019ve released 22 years of my tax returns. You can go online and look. (Donald Trump) hasn\u2019t released one.\"\nBiden\u2019s federal tax returns from 2019 dating back to 1998 are available online, as he claimed. The most recent returns are highlighted on his campaign website. Others can be found on the websites for the Obama White House and the 2008 Obama presidential campaign.\nTrump has not publicly released his tax returns, making him the only president or major-party presidential nominee in decades who has not done so.\u00a0\nWe rate Biden\u2019s claim True.\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections FactChat #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click\u00a0here, for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18838"}
