The list of claims first circulated in the form of a chain email in 2006, according to Snopes.com. Six years later, we checked several of the claims ourselves.\nWith immigration in the headlines today, these claims are popular again.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll fact-check No. 6: \"39% of All California Students are illegals.\"\nAccording to estimates by Enrico A. Marcelli of San Diego State University and Manuel Pastor of the University of Southern California, only about 3 percent of the child population in California -- defined as those under 18 -- were undocumented immigrants in the period 2008 to 2012. That\u2019s far below the 39 percent suggested by the meme.\nThere\u2019s another way to look at the scope of undocumented immigrants within the California K-12 system -- to look at the percentage of California K-12 students whose parents are unauthorized.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, 12.3 percent of K-12 students in California in 2014 had an unauthorized immigrant parent.\nThis is a broader category -- encompassing parents rather than just students -- but even this doesn\u2019t come close to the meme\u2019s 39 percent figure.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that \"the vast majority of children of unauthorized immigrants are U.S. citizens\u2014upwards of 80 percent,\" said Jeffrey Passel, senior demographer at Pew Research Center.\nThe 39 percent is \"way off,\" said Manuel Pastor, director of the Center for the Study of Immigrant Integration at the University of Southern California.\nOur ruling\nThe viral image said, \"39% of All California Students are illegals.\"\nThat\u2019s well above the most solid estimates we\u2019ve seen. Perhaps 3 percent of students are themselves undocumented, and 12.3 percent have a parent who is undocumented.\nWe rate the statement False.\n Share the Facts 2018-07-05 16:55:17 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  \"39% of All California Students are illegals.\"    Viral image on the Internet    social media postings Tuesday, July 3, 2018 2018-07-03    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01892"}
