Mortality rate way down!!!\"\nCases up only because of our big number testing. Mortality rate way down!!! https://t.co/bKFmgOLEGZ\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 23, 2020 \nHis argument that tests are the only reason for rising cases is not accurate. But on the trend for mortality, Trump has a point.\nEpidemiologists told PolitiFact that due to wide variations in testing patterns, the data doesn\u2019t offer a clear look at how likely someone is to die from the virus if they are infected with it. Gaps in testing leave too many undiagnosed cases to reliably determine a person\u2019s likelihood of dying from the coronavirus, much less whether the likelihood of dying has risen or fallen over time.\nInstead, researchers say, the most solid metric for assessing Trump\u2019s statement is the number of new coronavirus deaths reported per day.\nThe number of daily deaths from coronavirus has been falling consistently since peaking in late April. In fact, even as infections have risen since early June, deaths have not. (The orange line in the following chart shows the seven-day rolling average of coronavirus deaths, which smooths out data variations.)\n\n\u00a0\nAt the peak in late April, more than 2,000 were dying from coronavirus on a typical day. In late June, it\u2019s less than 600. That\u2019s still a large number of deaths every day. All told, roughly 115,000 have died from COVID-19 to date.\nThe White House told PolitiFact that the per-capita number of deaths in the United States is also lower than it is in several advanced industrialized countries in Europe that were hard hit by the virus. According to Johns Hopkins University, the number of coronavirus deaths per 100,000 population is about 37 for the United States, compared with 65 in the United Kingdom, 61 in Spain, and 57 in Italy.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut other European countries have lower death rates for COVID-19 than the United States does, including the Netherlands, Ireland, Germany, Switzerland and Denmark.\u00a0\nSo why are deaths falling? There may be several reasons, and for now, they\u2019re somewhat speculative.\nOne possibility is that the initial wave of infections disproportionately reached more patients with weaker immune systems, including those in nursing homes, or more vulnerable Americans who hadn\u2019t yet taken up effective social distancing. By contrast, more recent waves of infections may be reaching younger and healthier people who are better able to survive an infection.\nAnother possibility is that we\u2019re \"getting better at treatment and keeping people alive,\" said Tara Smith, an epidemiologist at Kent State University\u2019s College of Public Health.\nStill, epidemiologists caution that deaths are a lagging indicator. The disease often takes two to three weeks to run its course, meaning that one day\u2019s crop of new infections tends to drive the deaths that occur two to three weeks later.\n\"We might not expect an increase in the death rate until approximately 21 days from when we started to see an increase in cases,\" said Brooke Nichols, an infectious disease modeler at the Boston University School of Public Health.\nSo far, the age breakdown for deaths has been fairly consistent \u2014 people older than 65 accounted for 81% of coronavirus deaths at the mortality peak in mid-April, and that age group still accounted for 82% of in mid-July, a time when the total number of deaths had fallen significantly, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nSince we\u2019re about two weeks into the national rise in infections, scientists will be watching to see if deaths start increasing a week from now.\nOur ruling\nTrump said that mortality from coronavirus is \"way down.\"\nThis is one of the few coronavirus measurements that Trump can point to with optimism. The number of deaths has remained substantial, at a bit below 600 per day by mid-to-late June, but that\u2019s more than two-thirds lower than the peak of about 2,000 daily deaths in late April. The number of coronavirus deaths per day has continued to fall in June even as the number of cases has risen.\u00a0\nTrump\u2019s statement is accurate for now, though it\u2019s too soon to know whether the recent rise in new cases will produce an uptick in deaths by early July.
