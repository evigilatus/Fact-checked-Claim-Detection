But one widely-shared photo claims those protesters aren\u2019t practicing what they preach.\nThe photo, published on Facebook on Sept. 20, purports to show a field full of trash left behind by demonstrators.\n\"Yes, listen to the kids, they will guide our planet, I guess they haven\u2019t learnt (sic) the basics yet,\" the caption reads.\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It\u2019s been shared more than 130,000 times, so we wanted to check it out.\nTurns out the photo does not show the aftermath of any climate strike demonstrations \u2014\u00a0it was taken months before they even happened.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 25, 2021 in a video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Bill Gates said \u201cat least 3 billion people need to die\u201d from the planet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Daniel Funke \u2022 January 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing a reverse image search, we found the viral Facebook photo is at least five months old. It was originally posted online in April after an event celebrating 420, a holiday for marijuana enthusiasts, in London\u2019s Hyde Park.\u00a0\nBut even in April, the image was taken out of context and miscaptioned in an effort to smear climate change protesters.\nThere's a lot of incorrect information doing the Twitter rounds this morning. This photo is the result of an unofficial event in Hyde Park on Saturday, not the #ExtinctionRebellion protestors in Marble Arch.It costs us millions to clear #litter every year. Please take it home. pic.twitter.com/F1JtAqmnVO\u2014 Royal Parks (@theroyalparks) April 23, 2019 \nAround the same time as the 420 event in Hyde Park, climate change activists who were part of a movement called the Extinction Rebellion were protesting at various locations around central London. We found the miscaptioned trash photo in several replies to tweets from activists like Greta Thunberg, who gave a speech to the protesters April 21. The Swedish teenager is also credited with inspiring the Sept. 20 climate strike.\nThe Facebook post is inaccurate. We rate it False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00132"}
