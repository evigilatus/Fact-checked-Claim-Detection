They took a little walk. They found shredded ballots in Dell boxes. Police came as well. They wanted to confiscate phones with evidence. Here is just the first few photos.\"\u00a0\nOur team is in Georgia. They took a little walk. They found shredded ballots in Dell boxes. Police came as well.

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThis is wrong. Shredding ballots is a federal crime and there is no credible evidence that the scraps of paper in the image are ballots.\u00a0\nCoello didn\u2019t identify where in Georgia her photo was taken or which law enforcement agency responded. She also didn\u2019t reply to PolitiFact\u2019s questions.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.

We\u2019ve had no credible reports of this happening anywhere,\" Gabriel Sterling, a Republican who manages Georgia\u2019s voting system implementation, told PolitiFact. \"It\u2019s a federal crime to shred ballots. It\u2019s not happening, and if there was evidence as such, law enforcement would be called and there would be an investigation.\"\nSterling also said there\u2019s nothing to be gained by shredding ballots. Election officials have a record of the number of people who voted, and if there was evidence of missing ballots, an audit would follow.\n\"We have shredded nothing,\" Fulton County spokesperson Jessica Corbitt-Dominguez wrote in an email. \"Absentee ballots come in two envelopes. Those envelopes must be opened for the ballots to be counted. We have tens of thousands of ballots to open and use envelope opening equipment to do so.\"\u00a0\nShe added: \"As a result of the process of opening thousands of envelopes, paper waste is left behind. That is what was \u2018discovered.\u2019 This was explained to the individuals onsite.\"\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post shares a screenshot of a viral tweet that claimed to find shredded ballots in boxes in Georgia.\nThis is bogus. Shredding ballots is a federal crime and election officials in the state rejected the claim. Representatives from Fulton County, which was identified as the location where the photo was taken, said the shreds of paper are from the envelopes that absentee ballots come in.\nPants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19124"}
