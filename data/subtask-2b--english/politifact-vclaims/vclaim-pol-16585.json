And I think they're in error on that one.\"\n\n\nIndeed, Romney is the only Republican front-runner unequivocally backing a constitutional gay marriage ban.\n\n\nGiuliani, Thompson and McCain share his opposition to same-sex marriage but they vary in how they would address the issue at the federal level. Romney is the only Republican front-runner to support an amendment to the Constitution, such as the one that failed in Congress last year, which would limit marriage to male-female unions.\n\n\nMcCain, who actively opposed the 2006 amendment attempt on the grounds that it was unnecessary and would violate states' rights, says that he would only support such an amendment if the Supreme Court began to strike down state-level gay marriage bans.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

That provision was included in the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, which Thompson and McCain both supported, but it is still being challenged in the courts. A constitutional amendment would preempt any judicial challenge to the existing law.\n\n\nA spokesman for Giuliani said the former mayor \"does not support a federal marriage amendment at this time.\" Giuliani told CNN's Larry King in February 2007 that he would not support a constitutional amendment, \"unless all of a sudden lots of states do what Massachusetts does and kind of come at it from the other side and decide that the Constitution says that -- that you cannot have marriage between a man and a woman. If it stays the way it is, you don't need one.\"\n\n\nWe find Romney's statement on his opponents to be True because he is accurately describing their positions.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16585"}
