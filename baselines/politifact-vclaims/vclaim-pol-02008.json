No", "text": "New York state ranks only behind California for taxing the rich, Christine Quinn said at the Democratic Party\u2019s state convention on Long Island.\n\"Second-highest millionaires tax in the nation, highest on the East Coast, only behind California but we'll find a way to beat them, too,\" Quinn, vice chairperson of the New York State Democratic Committee, said to applause from the party\u2019s delegates.\nWhen Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo took office in 2011 he was staunchly opposed to the tax on the state\u2019s highest earners. He, like Republicans, thought it would prod high-income residents to leave the state and lead to less income-tax revenue.\nCuomo, however, has since fought to preserve the tax. He repeated Quinn\u2019s claim in his speech at the convention.\n\"Our millionaires tax is the second-highest in the nation and the highest in the East,\" Cuomo said.\nNew York state has a reputation as a high-tax state. But does the state have the second-highest millionaires tax rate in the nation?\nThe millionaires tax\nIn 2009, state lawmakers and then-Gov. David Paterson raised the state income tax rate from 6.85 percent to 8.97 percent for earners making $500,000 or more. The tax, intended to help close the state\u2019s deficit, was supposed to expire after three years.\nCuomo and state lawmakers agreed to extend the so-called \"millionaires tax\" before it ended, but lowered the rate to 8.82 percent for people making about $1 million or more. They eliminated the\u00a0higher rate for filers making less.\nThe top rate remains at 8.82 percent in 2018. Democrats in the Assembly have proposed\u00a0setting even higher rates for people making more than $5 million annually. Republicans oppose that proposal.\nOther states\nSome residents of New York State \u2014 but not all \u2014 pay the second-highest income taxes in the country.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColin Schmitt\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a news conference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have scientific data, from all different levels, but particularly from the high school sports levels, from numerous different states that shows that it is safe to play what New York is considering high-risk sports.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jill Terreri Ramos \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome cities in New York state, like New York City, collect their own local income tax on top of the state tax. Neither Quinn nor Cuomo made reference to the city in their speeches.\nThe highest earners in New York City pay a local income tax of 3.876 percent. That applies to single filers making more than $50,000 a year and married filers making more than $90,000. That rate was already in place before Cuomo took office.\nThe combined state and local income tax rate in New York City is 12.7 percent for people who make about $1 million or more. That\u2019s less than California\u2019s 13.3 percent state income tax rate, but more than the rates in the other states.\nWe couldn\u2019t find another city in the U.S. with a higher combined state and local income tax rate. Richard Auxier, a research associate with the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, confirmed that New York City residents pay the second-highest combined rate behind California.\nQuinn\u2019s claim doesn\u2019t hold up outside New York City. Seven states have higher income tax rates on wealthy earners, according to research from the right-leaning Tax Foundation, a tax policy analysis group. Auxier confirmed that finding.\nCalifornia is highest, but two of New York state\u2019s neighboring states also have higher tax rates on the wealthy. Vermont taxes people who make more than $416,650 at 8.95 percent and New Jersey taxes those making more than $500,000 at 8.97 percent.\nIn the Midwest, Iowa and Minnesota tax their highest earners at 8.98 percent and 9.85 percent, respectively. Oregon\u2019s highest rate is 9.90 percent and Hawaii reinstated an 11 percent state income tax for wealthy earners this year.\nNew York state and California are the only two states with an isolated tax bracket for filers who earn about $1 million or more. The highest brackets in the other six states start lower, from $71,190 to $500,000.\nWashington D.C., while not a state, also has an income tax bracket for filers making $1 million or more, and they are taxed at 8.95 percent.\nNo one from the State Democratic Committee offered an on-the-record explanation supporting Quinn's claim.\nOur ruling\nChristine Quinn said New York state has the \"second-highest millionaires tax in the nation.\"\nThat\u2019s only true for New York City residents. Millionaires outside New York City have a lower rate than those in seven other states.\nHer claim contains an element of truth about New York City.
