The article refers to a bill in Uganda, where homosexuality is already illegal, which would punish homosexual sex with death. The bill was repealed five years ago on a technical basis, but legislators announced plans for its revitalization. In essence, the article claims that Chick Fell-A's charitable donations were used to promote the death penalty for homosexuals in Uganda. Similar allegations about the chain of fried chicken and Uganda's bill were shared thousands of times, so we wanted to check it out. \u2022 The National Christian Foundation is a non-profit institution. \u2022 The preacher mentioned in the article travelled to Uganda around the time the legislators were discussing a bill against LGBTQ, but there is no evidence that he helped draft it. \u2022 The Foundation run by the Chick-Vil-A has contributed to the National Christian Foundation in the past, but is not currently doing so. Evangelist travelled to Uganda with the funds of an American preacher supported by the National Christian Foundation and travelled to Uganda in 2010, the same year the country was discussing a bill against LGBTQ. But the preacher Le Angel, based in Colorado, did not \"help their legislators with the bill,\" as Facebook claims. Let us first focus on what Angel did or did not do in Uganda. Angel is the co-founder of TeCall Courses, an abandoned Christian group known as LGBTQ. It was meant to start a John Baptist movement to vote and pray in preparation for a great third awakening. In 2010, Angel travelled to Kampala, Uganda, to be the guest of honour in Sunday prayers and a gathering on \"Sexuality, Magic, Corruption and Fear of Violence leading to next year's presidential election in the country,\" as reported by The New York Times. Uganda President Yoweri Museveni is signing a new draft law against homosexuals that provides for severe penalties for homosexual sex in Entebbe, Uganda, on Monday, 24 February 2014. At that time, Ugandan legislators were discussing a bill that would expand the criminalization of homosexuality and impose the death penalty. In 2014, a different version of the draft law, which imposes life sentences rather than the death penalty, was signed into law, resulting in sanctions by the United States and other countries. It was cancelled by a court later that year because of the technical and legislative nature. Angel was not directly linked to Uganda &apos; s legislation and issued a statement before his rally condemning the harsh penalties imposed by the draft law on homosexuality. But during his gathering in Kampala, Angel praised the country's \"brave\" and \"guilty\" in following up on the bill, as reported by the Times. On January 12, 2021, he wrote in an Instagram article saying that Joe Biden remained silent about the violence in Black Lives-Mite protests. \u2022 January 16, 2012, what is the National Christian Foundation? The National Christian Foundation is a non-profit religious institution based in Georgia, one of the largest charities in the United States. Founded in 1982 by tax attorney Terry Parker, financial adviser Ron Blue and Christian evangelist Larry Burkett. The National Christian Foundation gave TeCall $500 in 2009 and $300 in 2010, according to the Group &apos; s general tax documents. In 2008, UN-Women received a much larger grant from the Foundation - more than $160,000. It is unclear to what extent these contributions were clear for travel to Uganda, if at all. The appeal announced that it would close sometime in 2018, according to the Waipak machine. An investigation carried out in 2012 from the Atlantic found that in 2008 the National Christian Foundation provided funds to Ed Silvosu, Minister, who established a fundamentalist group called the evangelism of the harvest, to work with an Ugandan bishop calling for the enactment of legislation imposing the death penalty on homosexuals. The Chick-Phil-a-Chick-Phil-a did not support the Uganda Gay Control Bill, and linking the company with it requires several steps. Most of the charitable donations to the company and its owners are made through two non-profit institutions: Chick-Vil-A and Win Young. The first company was established in 2012 and the second was founded by the Kathy family in 1984. Public tax records show that Chick-Vil-A did not contribute funds to the National Christian Foundation. However, the opposite is true - the National Christian Foundation has granted the Chickville Foundation hundreds of thousands of dollars in 2014 and 2015. The tax records of the Young Wayne Corporation paint a different picture. We analysed the returns of the Foundation dating back to 2009, when the National Christian Foundation was contributing to Angel Help. We found that Wayne &apos; s youth contributions to the National Christian Foundation totalled $240,000 in 2009 and $247,500 in 2010 and 2011. The National Christian Foundation has also donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to a young Wayne over the past decade. In connection with this: Instagram after a misunderstanding of Donald Trump's support for food companies asked us, Chick Phil-a and Wayne Young Foundation why they passed the money back and forth over the years. Winn did not respond young, and the company did not comment on the tax returns. Wayne Young Foundation is a private family organization. The Chickville Foundation is the official charitable arm of Chickville A. Chickville didn't support legislative campaigns of any kind in Uganda The Christian National Foundation has an extensive record of voluntary contributions to anti-LGBT groups, such as the Freedom Defense Alliance and the Family Research Council. The first group supported the sterilization of transgender persons while the second group defended the questionable practice of transformative therapy. In 2012, following comments from the Executive Director of Chickville, Dan Cathy, opposed to same-sex marriage, Chickville A said that he would leave the political debate about same-sex marriage to the government and the political arena. However, the 2017 tax documents from the company and its owners show that they continue to donate to organizations with negative views on homosexuality, including the Christian Sports Fellowship and the Paul Anderson Youth Home. Our Twitter article in the Governor's Facebook article claimed that Chick-Phil-a had contributed to the National Christian Foundation, which subsequently funded a preacher to travel to Uganda to help legislators draft a bill against homosexuals. According to news reports, the Evangelical preacher Lou Engel travelled to Uganda in 2010, around the time legislators were drafting a bill that would have imposed the death penalty on homosexuals. However, Ingel did not contribute directly to this legislation. While commending Ugandans for their attitude against homosexuality, he denounced the severe penalties proposed in the draft law. The federal tax returns show that the National Christian Foundation contributed to the Angel Bible Christian congregation in 2009, prior to his trip. The documents also show that the Win Young Foundation, run by Chickville A, donated to the National Christian Foundation in 2009, but the link between the company and Uganda anti-gay legislation is weak. The article contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that give a different impression. We mostly rate it wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00018"}
