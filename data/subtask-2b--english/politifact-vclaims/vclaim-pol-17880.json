The man, who reportedly said he was intoxicated at the time, was convicted the following year.\u00a0\nThe second photo is an AFP image taken by Daniel Slim. The graffiti was \"left by demonstrators protesting the death of George Floyd\" in Lafayette Square, according to the caption. The building is not a memorial; a spokesperson for the U.S. Park Police told PolitiFact it was a public bathroom.\nThe cracked memorial to Murphy, who was killed in combat in Afghanistan in 2005, was vandalized in July 2018. A teenage boy was arrested after the stone engraved with Murphy\u2019s image was found smashed at a lake on New York\u2019s Long Island, Stars and Stripes reported at the time.\u00a0\u00a0\nAnd, finally, that image of graffiti covering rows of names? It\u2019s a Vietnam memorial in Venice, Calif., that was vandalized in 2016.\nWe rate these Facebook posts False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17880"}
