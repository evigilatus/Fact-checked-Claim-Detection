Since these unique gene sequences don\u2019t occur by random chance, they\u2019re proof that this virus was engineered by scientists in a lab,\" the story reads.\nThe article goes on to say that the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are \"covering up this inconvenient fact in order to protect communist China.\" Natural News does not provide evidence for the claim.\nThe story was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

The outbreak started in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in December and has since spread to 24 countries.\nOne of the most popular conspiracies about the coronavirus is that it was created in a lab, possibly as a bioweapon. We\u2019ve previously said those claims are unproven \u2014\u00a0and the Natural News story has similar shortcomings.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 25, 2021 in a blog post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWHO now saying you do not need to wear a mask.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe website says that \"every virology lab in the world that has run a genomic analysis of the coronavirus now knows that the coronavirus was engineered by human scientists.\" But none of the researchers that has analyzed the virus has come to that conclusion.\nAccording to the CDC, both the agency and Chinese authorities have isolated the genome of the 2019 coronavirus. Their findings suggest \"a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.\"\nWe analyzed the eight publications the CDC lists on its landing page about coronavirus. None asserts that the virus was engineered by humans.\nRELATED:\u00a0PolitiFact\u2019s coronavirus coverage in one place\nOne study, which analyzed the genetic sequence of the coronavirus, was published Jan. 30 in the journal The Lancet. It says the 2019 coronavirus is a human betacoronavirus similar to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and likely comes from bats.\n\"Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans,\" the study reads.\u00a0\nEarly reports on the virus focused on the fact that many patients were linked to the Wuhan market. That suggested animal-to-person spread, according to the CDC, but later, a growing number of patients reported not having any connection to the market. That suggested the coronavirus was spreading person-to-person.\nOther blogs and social media users have speculated that a lab near Wuhan could be the source of the virus. The Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory is a maximum-security biolab that deals with some of the world\u2019s most dangerous pathogens, including Ebola and SARS. As of now, however, there is no evidence that the lab is the source of the outbreak.\nThe Natural News article is unsupported by evidence. We rate it False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17371"}
