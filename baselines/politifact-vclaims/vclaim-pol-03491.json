Rick Santorum\u2019s mouth", "text": "Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum has been a pro-life stalwart throughout his political career. He\u2019s regularly said he would oppose abortion in all cases -- even incidents of rape and incest. But did he recently go so far as to say, \"Sometimes pregnancy is God\u2019s way of comforting rape victims?\"\nAccording to Uspoln, a \"U.S. political news\" site with 23,000 Facebook likes (and some of the weirdest \"you may also like\" links of all time), Santorum made the comment on \"Piers Morgan Live\" in mid-February. It uses that quote as a headline and then presents further comments about abortion attributed to Santorum. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nHere\u2019s the thing: Santorum didn\u2019t give most of these comments in the way Uspoln presented them, and he certainly didn\u2019t say them this year.\nUspoln published the article Feb. 18, 2017. Its article states Santorum spoke to Piers Morgan \"last Friday,\" which would have been Feb. 17. That is not possible. Morgan has been off the air since 2014. He is currently working as an editor for the Daily Mail. \u00a0\nNow, during his time on CNN, Morgan did once host Santorum. During Santorum\u2019s presidential run in 2012, he and his family appeared on the show, and Morgan asked him about abortion in cases of rape and incest. \u00a0\nUspoln\u2019s article partially paraphrases and partially directly quotes Santorum. It says, \"sexual assault victims should \u2018accept this horribly created\u2019 pregnancy because it is \u2018nevertheless a gift in a very broken way\u2019 and that, when it comes down to it, a victim \u2018just has to make the best out of a bad situation.\u2019\"\nUspoln also quotes Santorum and Morgan having an exchange in which Santorum compares a pregnancy through rape to a suicide bombing. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPat Toomey\n\n\nstated on January 19, 2021 in a hearing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere will be several thousand dollars in payments going to families with six-figure incomes who\u2019ve had no income interruption whatsoever.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jessica Calefati \u2022 January 21, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the full statement Santorum made to Morgan, according to a transcript from the show: \"As horrible as the way that that son or daughter and son was created, it still is her child. And whether she has that child or doesn't, it will always be her child. And she will always know that. And so to embrace her and to love her and to support her and get her through this very difficult time, I've always, you know, I believe and I think the right approach is to accept this horribly created -- in the sense of rape -- but nevertheless a gift in a very broken way, the gift of human life, and accept what God has given to you. As you know, we have to, in lots of different aspects of our life. We have horrible things happen. I can't think of anything more horrible. But, nevertheless, we have to make the best out of a bad situation.\"\nAccording to the transcript, the conversation between Santorum and Morgan about suicide bombing and a pregnancy from a rape did not occur. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nSantorum\u2019s remarks did lead to some backlash in 2012. An opinion writer for The Guardian, for instance, wrote a critical story on Santorum with the headline, \"Rick Santorum thinks pregnancy through rape is God\u2019s gift? Seriously?\" \u00a0\nUspoln did not respond to an interview request. The site appears to regularly twist and embellish the words of famous politicians and then publish or re-publish the articles months after the comments were made. For example, after a Sarah Palin Facebook post about Black Lives Matter caused controversy last summer, Uspoln ran an article falsely claiming Palin said, \"I\u2019m sick of being called a racist. If it\u2019s dangerous for blacks here, they can go back to Africa.\"\nOur ruling\nThe website Uspoln claimed Rick Santorum said, \"Sometimes pregnancy is God\u2019s way of comforting rape victims\" and also made other comments comparing suicide bombing and pregnancies because of rape in February 2017 on a TV show with Piers Morgan. \"Piers Morgan Live\" has not been on television since 2014 and in a 2012 interview with Morgan, Santorum made no such comments. Though he did say pregnancy from a rape should be \"approached...as a gift in a very broken way,\" Santorum did not say pregnancy was \"God\u2019s way of comforting rape victims\" and made no comparisons to suicide bombing. \u00a0\nWe rule the claim False. \nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/217c286c-c3a4-4b7a-94f0-202ed85b3329", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03491"}
