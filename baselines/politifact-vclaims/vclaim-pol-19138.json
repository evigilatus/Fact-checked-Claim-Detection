This was Antifa,\" Sen. Shannon Grove wrote in a Tweet, which has since been deleted.\u00a0\nGrove is from Bakersfield and is the state Senate Republican Leader.\n\nGrove\u2019s post, which was live on Twitter for only a few moments approximately, cited a separate tweet and photo from attorney and Trump supporter Lin Wood. He claimed two men in the photo are affiliated with antifa, a loosely affiliated group of far-left anti-fascism activists.\nThe problem? One of the men was quickly identified by journalists who track far-right extremism as a neo-Nazi.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in remarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar groundless claims about antifa appeared on Facebook and in pro-Trump media, including from Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) who tweeted \"ANTIFA fascists in backwards MAGA hats,\" suggesting that some members of the violent mob were not supporters of the president.\nBut video and photographs from the scene show people wearing and waving Trump-branded paraphernalia and flags. Reporters covering the events described the crowd as Trump supporters. The crowd also included supporters of the QAnon conspiracy theory, according to reporters present.\nTrump spoke to a rally of supporters in Washington hours before the violence erupted, and he urged them to come to the city on Jan. 6 and back his efforts to overturn the election.\u00a0\nGrove\u2019s spokesperson declined an interview request and cited a follow-up tweet by the senator, which reads: \"This is unacceptable. America guarantees the freedom of speech and to protest, but this is not the way to settle differences.
