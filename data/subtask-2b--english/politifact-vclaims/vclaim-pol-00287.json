That is what I believe Donald Trump has chosen to do.\"\n\"Days before the midterm,\" Biden continued, \"He fomented fears of a caravan headed to the United States and created hysteria when he said, \u2018Look, look at what's marching up. This is an invasion.\u2019 He asserted that immigrants would quote, \u2018carve you up with a knife\u2019.\"\u00a0\nTrump regularly speaks of an invasion. He has mentioned it at many rallies, including one in Michigan in March and another in Florida in May. He said then, \"When you see these caravans, starting out with 20,000 people, that's an invasion.\" He has used the word in seven tweets since July 2015 to refer to immigrants more broadly, according to Factba.se.\nBut this fact-check focuses on whether Trump warned that immigrants will \"carve you up with a knife.\"\nHe did not.\nAt an October 2018 rally in Texas, Trump attacked then-U.S. Senate candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke, who is now running for U.S. president.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

And he voted for Obama amnesty. O'Rourke even voted to shield MS-13 gang members from deportation. He doesn't want to deport them. He says they're people. They're people. They carve you up with a knife, but they're people.\"\nMS-13 is a violent transnational gang with members primarily in Central America and the United States. Trump\u2019s words were clearly aimed at gang members, not all immigrants.\nFor the record, O\u2019Rourke did not vote to shield MS-13 members from deportation. PolitiFact Texas dug into a U.S. House dispute over a bill that would give U.S. officials more leeway in defining gangs. Democrats argued that officials already had the authority to deport anyone suspected of gang involvement.\nThe Biden campaign did not respond in time for publication.\nOur ruling\nBiden said that Trump \"asserted that immigrants would quote, \u2018carve you up with a knife\u2019.\"\nTrump was talking about MS-13 gang members.\nWe rate this claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00287"}
