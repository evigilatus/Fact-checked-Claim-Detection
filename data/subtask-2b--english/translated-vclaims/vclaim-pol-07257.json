Or Congress? The answer to Mimi Facebook is none of the above.", "text": "For whose pants are the most burned: national basketball, national football, congressional or Facebook mimes? Many readers sent us Facebook messages this week asking about Mimi showing up on their news radio. It is a list of statistics on crime, corruption and generally bad behaviour, and asks viewers to guess whether the list describes players in the National Bar Association or the National Football Federation. Surprise! He actually says he describes Congress. The Mimi hit us as a direct suspect from the bats. Of the 535 members of Congress: 36 were arrested on charges of marital assault on 7 persons on fraud charges, 19 were charged with writing bad checks, 117 were directly or indirectly bankrupted by at least 2 businesses, three of which were unable to obtain a credit card because of the assault, as 14 were arrested on drug charges, and 8 were currently arrested on charges of stealing 21 stores in lawsuits, 84 of which were arrested for driving in drunkenness last year. One copy was posted on Facebook on September 18, and has already more than 328,000 shares, and M. appeared on Reddit a few times this week, too. Our friends in Snoops and Viktorchek.org have been thinking about the allegations in this picture for years. But with the current National Football Union scandal regarding the abuse of husband and child, it makes sense that this amulet is spreading again. So we're gonna untie it again. We do not argue that some legislators are involved in heinous activities. Take, for example, the former Republic of Tri Radell, R-Fla, who resigned earlier this year after being arrested for buying cocaine from a federal agent. There is no comprehensive database on all crimes committed by Congress and generally inappropriate behaviour, so we cannot reach the real numbers alone. But we know enough about where the meme grew up to say that these statistics can't be trusted. We looked into the news, quarterly profiles of congressional membership and other sources, and found nowhere near 84 arrests for drunk driving, 14 arrests for drugs, 36 accusations of spousal abuse or any of these other charges. We're not even sure how to measure things like an indirect business bankruptcy or someone's conviction. On January 13, 2021, in notes in CNN's broadcast, the second presidential indictment of Donald Trump was \"most isolated between the two parties in American history.\" However, Snoops examined a near identical version of 2012 that refers to a series of articles in 1999 by Capitol Hill Blue, a political publication on the Internet. Capitol Hill Blue had many credible cases in the past. Remember, if these statistics are correct - and we are reasonably certain that they are not - they are 15 years old. Only 100 members of the current Congress were in office in 1999, when Capitol Hill Blue published these stories. According to Capitol Hill Blue, authors &apos; research revealed each of the above statistics, although at times in a slightly different format. (Except one, the article states that 29 members were charged with ill-treatment of the husband rather than 36 members.) The authors state \"public records, previous press articles, civil court cases and criminal records,\" but do not cite specific documents. They also clearly say from some of their sources, \"We have spoken to former partners and business partners who were excluded in the cold by people who thought they were friends.\" So these sources may have had an agenda to talk to Blue Capitol Hill. We can't even check out the congressmen they're talking about. The article says: \"We will not make lists of every member who has written a bad check, or punch someone or is accused of slapping a husband.\" All this makes it difficult to take these allegations seriously. In addition, the series was removed from the Capitol Hill Blue website. It can only be accessed through the Wayback machine in the Internet archive, which provides web pages periodically. As far as we can tell, it was removed in mid-2013. * (In the last version kept, the editors deleted the statistics from the entire article. We contacted Capitol Hill Blue for comment, but we didn't answer it. Our ruling in Mimi Facebook says that Congress has 36 people accused of marital assault, 84 arrested for drunk driving last year, 71 in bad reputation and more. These charges appear to be fabricated. The statistics came from an article written 15 years ago, and the original source, Capitol Hill Blue, deleted the original article from his website. The congressional record is by no means flawless, but these statistics are in fact unfounded. We value this me pants on fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07257"}
