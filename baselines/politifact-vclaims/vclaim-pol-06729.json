Maggie Hassan. In her second inaugural speech in January and in her budget address Thursday, Feb. 12, Hassan, a Democrat, made a point of drawing attention to New Hampshire\u2019s rosy reputation.\n\"Our country\u2019s economy continues to strengthen \u2013 and in many respects, New Hampshire remains ahead of the curve,\" Hassan said, ticking off a number of economic statistics. One was that \"our median household income in 2013 was the highest in the nation,.\"\nIn both speeches, Hassan pointed out that statistics don\u2019t always tell the whole story, saying that some working class families in the state continue to struggle.\nStill, was New Hampshire really at the top of the nation in 2013 in terms of household income? PolitiFact New Hampshire decided to check it out.\nThe statistic Hassan cited came from data collected and compiled by the U.S. Census Bureau. Specifically, her staff pointed to a set of data released in September 2014 that summed up the latest findings from the Current Population Survey\u2019s Annual Social and Economic Supplement.\nWhile the census conducts a population count every 10 years, it also compiles other types of data \u2014\u00a0on income, for example \u2014\u00a0through other surveys that occur more frequently.\nIn this case, the data was collected over a period of three months in 2013 \u2014\u00a0February, March and April.\nAccording to the census data, New Hampshire\u2019s median household income was $71,322 in 2013 \u2014\u00a0which was not only higher than the national median, but also higher than any other state.\nAs with any survey, there are some limitations to consider.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Godlewski\n\n\nstated on January 9, 2021 in Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all women that lost jobs (in the December jobs report), it was mostly Black and Latina women. In fact, white women gained employment.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Nusaiba Mizan \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne factor concerns how the data was calculated. To determine income, the census asks people to report the money they received during the previous year from multiple sources, including: earnings, unemployment compensation, workers\u2019 compensation, public assistance and more.\nThe census also notes that \"money income does not reflect the fact that some families receive part of their income in the form of noncash benefits,\" such as food stamps.\nAs noted by Drew Desilver for Pew Research Center, \"some economists say that income data have too many flaws to be the primary measure of inequality.\"\n\"For one thing,\" Desilver said, \"most income-inequality measures use income before taxes and transfer payments (such as Social Security, food stamps and unemployment benefits), which act to reduce inequality.\"\nSome researchers, Desilver notes, have instead suggested that other measures \u2014 someone\u2019s consumption, for example \u2014\u00a0would be a better way to measure someone\u2019s \"economic well-being.\"\nAnother factor to consider is the timing of the data. Using other census data that looks beyond just 2013, the year Hassan cited, shows that New Hampshire loses its top spot to Virginia when 2012 and 2014 information is considered.\nOur ruling\nGov. Maggie Hassan said New Hampshire\u2019s \"median household income in 2013 was the highest in the nation.\"\nLooking at U.S. Census data only for that year, Hassan is correct. For other recent periods, however, New Hampshire ranks just below the top. In the meantime, census data is widely trusted, but other calculation methods may have produced different results. However, Hassan was correct in qualifying that statement by suggesting that the survey might not tell the whole story.\nThe claim is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate the claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06729"}
