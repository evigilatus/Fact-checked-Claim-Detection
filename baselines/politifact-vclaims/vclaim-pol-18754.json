California sends 440,000 ballots to ineligible voters.\"\nPresident Donald Trump seized on the claim on Twitter, exclaiming: \"Rigged Election!\"\nThe Instagram post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook, which owns Instagram.)\u00a0\nAn analysis that the post relies on does not cite any evidence of fraud or rigging. And while it suggests some voter registrations may be out of date, it doesn\u2019t show that 440,000 on the registered voter list are ineligible to vote.\nWhat the analysis claims\nCiting the COVID-19 pandemic, Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered that ballots for the Nov. 3 general election be mailed to all registered California voters. About 21 million ballots were sent in early October.\nThe analysis cited in the Instagram post was done by Election Integrity Project California, a watchdog group that scrutinizes voter registration records. The analysis is detailed in an Oct. 17 letter to the California Secretary of State\u2019s Office.\nThe letter says the project\u2019s review of California voter registration files as of Aug. 18 found that the vast majority of the 440,000 \u2014 416,633 people \u2014 were registered on or before Nov. 4, 2008, and have not voted or updated their registrations since then. The letter concludes that those voters have \"likely\" died or moved.\nBut if the group\u2019s numbers are correct, it means only that those people haven\u2019t voted in recent elections and haven\u2019t changed addresses within California \u2014 not that they are ineligible to vote. How many of those people might be ineligible has not been established.\u00a0\nIn the past several presidential elections, about 20% to 25% of registered California voters did not cast a ballot, according to data compiled by the California Secretary of State\u2019s office, and participation tends to be far lower in other elections. The 416,633 voters cited by the analysis account for about 2% of California\u2019s roughly 21 million registered voters.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe analysis also said that another 3,342 names match a state Death Index record; and 19,802 people who appear to be registered twice and \"likely\" were mailed two ballots.\nMichael Wexler, an attorney for the Election Integrity Project California, told PolitiFact that the Instagram post\u2019s use of the word ineligible \"reasonably comprises the names of voters who are deceased (hence no longer eligible to vote anywhere) or no longer reside at the registration address (hence not eligible to vote there).\"\nNew version of a previous claim\nThe letter is essentially a new version of an April 28 letter that used a slightly higher number, 458,895.\nHere\u2019s what we found when we reviewed the earlier letter:\n\n\nElection officials acknowledge that some ballots are mailed erroneously to ineligible voters, given the lag time between a voter moving or dying and the receipt of official notices.\n\n\nOngoing maintenance of voter rolls includes updates of death records from the Department of Public Health weekly and change-of-address information from the Division of Motor Vehicles daily. So election experts said they strongly doubt so many ballots would go to Californians who died or moved.\u00a0\n\n\nJustin Levitt, associate dean for research at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, where he teaches constitutional law with a focus on election administration, said: \"Even if there are some registration records that are not perfectly accurate, that does not mean that they will be used to cast ballots that are counted. There are plenty of other safeguards in the process to make sure that individual ballots are not counted if they happen to be cast on behalf of people who have died or moved, including a signature-matching system that is rather vigorous.\"\n\n\nOur ruling\nA post on Instagram claims that California sends 440,000 ballots to ineligible voters, and raises the specter of voter fraud.\nThe analysis that the post is based on cites no evidence of fraud and provides no evidence that California sent 440,000 ballots for the general election to ineligible voters.\nWe rate the statement False.\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections FactChat #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click\u00a0here, for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18754"}
