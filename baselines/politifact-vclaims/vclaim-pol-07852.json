The group leader says the girls converted from Christianity to Islam and will not be released unless imprisoned Boko Haram members are freed.\nFox News host Sean Hannity isn\u2019t the only pundit to denounce the group\u2019s actions. He convened a panel on his May 12 show, which included liberal The Five co-host Bob Beckel, to criticize liberals touting the #BringBackOurGirls Twitter campaign supported by first lady Michelle Obama.\nWe\u2019ve seen conservatives offer similar criticisms in recent days, from Rush Limbaugh to Ann Coulter. Hannity took the discussion a step further, wondering if most Muslims subscribe to beliefs shared by Boko Haram.\nBeckel entered the conversation by saying the response from \"supposedly moderate\" heads of Muslim states has been weak. \"I tried to call the Egyptian embassy and I called the Saudi embassy to ask for a comment about these 275 girls and got nothing from them! When is a cleric, when is an imam, finally going to stand up and say, \u2018this is wrong\u2019?\"\nThat\u2019s when Hannity took over. \"Do you think that this is general acceptance? When you read the Koran it talks about don\u2019t take Christians and Jews as your friends. It talks about jihad. It talks about apostate. All these things are in there. And do you think most Muslims buy into this radicalism, or (are)\u00a0there moderate Muslims that are intimidated?\"\nOur question: Does the Koran talk about \"don\u2019t take Christians and Jews as your friends\"? \u00a0\nWhat is he talking about?\nA Fox News spokesperson said\u00a0Hannity was talking about verse 5:51 of the Koran, the sacred book of Muslims. It\u2019s a verse that has spawned blog posts and message board queries about what it really means.\nThe original Koran (also\u00a0Quran)\u00a0is in Arabic, and Muslims believe it to be the word of Allah spoken to the prophet Mohammad via the angel Gabriel over a 23-year period.\nJust as there are multiple English translations for the Bible, there are also English translations of the Koran, and experts are split on which translations are best and true to the Arabic text -- and on whether it should be translated at all. Interpretations are subjective, as not every word in Arabic has a flawless English equivalent.\n\"Scripture is not some sort of religious instruction manual that believers ingest uniformly and uncritically,\" says Kenneth Garden, a University of Tufts assistant professor of religion. \"It inspires, yes, but it is also malleable and open to creative readings that highlight some passages and ignore others in ways we could never predict.\"\nStill, the Quranic Arabic Corpus, a website that allows users to select passages from the Koran and compare parallel translations, offers several English translations of verse 5:51. Here are a few we found:\n\n\nSaheeh International: \"O you who have believed, do not take the Jews and the Christians as allies. They are (in fact) allies of one another. And whoever is an ally to them among you -- then indeed, he is (one) of them. Indeed, Allah guides not the wrongdoing people.\"\n\n\nArberry: \"O believers, take not Jews and Christians as friends; they are friends of each other. Whoso of you makes them his friends is one of them. God guides not the people of the evildoers.\"\n\n\nThe Noble Qur'an: \"O you who believe! Take not the Jews and the Christians as Auliya' (friends, protectors, helpers, etc.), they are but Auliya' to one another. And if any amongst you takes them as Auliya', then surely he is one of them. Verily, Allah guides not those people who are the Zalimun (polytheists and wrong\u00addoers and unjust).\"\n\n\nThe Message of The Quran says: \"O you who have attained to faith! Do not take the Jews and Christians for your allies: they are but allies of one another -- and whoever of you allies himself with them becomes, verily, one of them; behold, God does not guide such evildoers.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost but not all of these translations refer to friends while another says allies. Is the meaning as simple as it seems?\nLost in translation?\nWhat did the experts say? Reactions ranged from Hannity is partially right to wildly wrong.\n\"Certainly 5:51 and other verses like it are great material for a group like Boko Haram to use,\" Garden said, while noting other verses contain messages of tolerance and warnings. \"But apart from God speaking in a booming voice from on high and telling us how he would like the Koran to be interpreted, there is no objective way to say which is the correct reading of the scripture.\"\nLet\u2019s start with the translation that introduces the word \"Auliya\u2019.\"\nOther versions use \"friends,\" but that word connotes a sense of, well, friendliness that, according to some experts and opinions, isn\u2019t supposed to be reflected in the text. \"Auliya\u2019\" does not mean friends in the way of pals or companions. It\u2019s meaning is more about allies, protectors or guardians.\nOne footnote to this passage in The Message version of the Koran says \"this prohibition of a \u2018moral alliance\u2019 with non-Muslims does not constitute an injunction against normal, friendly relations with such of them as are well-disposed towards Muslims.\"\nBroader historical context is key, experts told us.\nThe verse refers to a specific period of tribal society in Mohammed\u2019s time, one marked by interreligious strife in which some Muslims in Medina were considering siding with certain Jewish tribes, said John L. Esposito, author of What Everyone Needs to Know About Islam and founding director of Georgetown University\u2019s Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding.\n\"What Hannity is doing is just cherry-picking a passage,\" Esposito said. \"It would be the equivalent of taking any of the statements in the Old Testament where God tells his people to fight and kill.\"\n\"The order here is not to take them as guardians or protectors,\" said Khaleel Mohammed, a San Diego State University professor who has compared English translations of the Koran. \"Incidentally, the word for \u2018guardian\u2019 in Arabic and in Islamic terminology is \u2018wali,\u2019 the singular of Awliya.\" \u00a0\nReading the passage as Muslims cannot be friends with Christians and Jews flies in the face of the general treatment of those religions in the Koran, Esposito said. The different faiths share a connection to\u00a0Abraham and a belief in the monotheistic God, and Islam acknowledges the word of God also coming in the Torah, Psalms and Gospels of the Bible.\n\"It contradicts the principle that both Christians and Jews are considered \u2018ahl al-kitab,\u2019 the people of the book,\" said Taoufik Ben Amor, Columbia University senior lecturer in Arabic studies. \"Muslims can marry (Christians and Jews), trade, and coexist without forcing them to convert.\"\nWhat\u2019s more relevant, some argued, is how most Muslims interpret the verse. Even though some radical Muslims may agree with Hannity\u2019s interpretation, most moderate Muslims believe it\u2019s a great thing to be friends with Jews and Christians, said Martha Schulte-Nafeh, University of Michigan Arabic program director.\nThe quote Hannity pulled is \"not the normative understanding of how Muslims are with people of other faith,\" said Edgar Hopida, spokesman for the Islamic Society of North America.\nOur ruling\nIn a segment condemning Boko Haram, Hannity said the Koran contains a verse that \"talks about don't take Christians and Jews as your friends.\"\nWhile some English translations of the Koran do include a similar phrase, some experts say Hannity is isolating the phrase out of its proper context. Also there is a debate if the true meaning of the passage is somehow altered in the translation itself. Much of the meaning depends on how people interpret scripture, which can be said for any spiritual text.\nHannity\u2019s claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details.
