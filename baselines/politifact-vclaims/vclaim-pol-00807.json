That plan embraces a greater reliance on renewable energy sources \u2014 like solar and wind \u2014 over a decade.\nTrump has trained his fire on wind power in particular during several recent speeches, claiming that consumers face major blackouts from nothing more than a simple shift in weather. And Trump\u2019s disdain for wind energy, as the Washington Post notes, has even deeper roots.\n\"When the wind stops blowing, that's the end of your electric,\" Trump told the Conservative Political Action Conference March 2. \"Let's hurry up. \u2018Darling, is the wind blowing today? I'd like to watch television, darling.\u2019 \"\nTrump continued hammering wind energy later that month at a rally in Michigan, saying that if Hillary Clinton had won the election the United States would not be a global leader in energy production.\n\"You would be doing wind, windmills,\" Trump said March 28. \"And if it doesn't blow you can forget about television for that night.\"\nThe president\u2019s riffs on wind energy grossly oversimplify things \u2014 perhaps for comedic effect. But the latest White House budget proposal would slash funding for renewable energy programs across the country. So we thought his comments were worth checking.\n\u2018Just because the wind stops blowing in one place does not mean the whole grid goes down\u2019\nEnsuring uninterrupted electricity when using renewable energy is a legitimate concern. Wind energy \u2014 and solar, for that matter \u2014 are considered \"intermittent energy sources,\" because of their dependence on weather conditions. But the issue is a manageable one under the current system, experts said.\nFirst off, the notion that a person gets electricity from only one wind farm is wrong. That\u2019s because American energy consumers in virtually all cases get their power from an interconnected grid, which pools together a portfolio of different generators.\n\"No home connected to the continental U.S. grid is primarily reliant on the wind the occupant feels in their backyard,\" said Daniel Schwartz, a professor at the University of Washington and director of the Clean Energy Institute.\nFor example, in the western United States, Schwartz said, power generation and consumption is transmitted across roughly a dozen states and Canadian provinces.\n\"On a still day in Seattle, the wind is blowing in Montana, or California, or elsewhere,\" he said.\nMichael Gillenwater, executive director of the Greenhouse Gas Management Institute, responded to Trump\u2019s claim this way: \"Just because the wind stops blowing in one place does not mean the whole grid goes down.\"\nExperts noted that utilities typically use a mix of sources to generate energy, including some, like natural gas, that aren\u2019t susceptible to running out if the winds are low or if clouds block the sun.\nIncreased reliance on renewables\nThe current energy system has successfully integrated renewables.\nAs of 2018, renewable sources made up around 17 percent of total U.S. energy. Among renewables, hydropower provided the most, at 7 percent, with wind energy a close second. Fossil fuels, on the other hand, accounted for nearly two-thirds of American power.\n\nSource:\u00a0U.S. Energy Information Administration\u200b\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

Batteries cannot currently provide sufficient backup generation, he argued, so the only practical alternative to maintain grid stability would be from a non-renewable source, which would mean maintaining elements of the current system.\nThere\u2019s some debate about whether the Green New Deal is truly pushing for a \"100% renewable system,\" or some lower threshold.\nThe legislative language does not spell out what energy sources would comprise a new grid. In fact, its elasticity on this point appears to be something of a selling point. As Green New Deal co-sponsor Sen. Ed Markey, D.-Mass, said, \"The resolution is silent on any individual technology. We are open to whatever works.\"\nRather, the proposal calls for \"100% of power demand through clean, renewable, and zero-emissions energy sources.\" To some, the plan could encompasses more than just renewables, to include nuclear power, or even fossil fuels with carbon capture.\nSchwartz, of the Clean Energy Institute, said the\u00a0challenges of wind power are widely recognized in engineering circles. But he was bullish on the future of green technology.\n\"My reaction is optimistic,\" he said. \"I see engineering challenges, not insurmountable barriers created by the laws of nature.\"\nAlready, some utilities use some of the surplus electricity they generate to pump water uphill, where it can be released downhill to generate electricity as needed. Going forward, researchers are working on additional methods, such as next-generation batteries, to store energy so it can be kept in reserve for slack periods for wind or solar generation.\nGillenwater agreed there\u2019s a lively debate about the feasibility of building a 100 percent renewable system, and pointed us to this article from Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers\u2019 magazine.\nBut he noted that \"getting to about 80 percent is generally seen as not a problem technically or economically.\"\nGideon Weissman, a policy analyst with Frontier Group, said the National Renewable Energy Laboratory has done substantial research on what a greener grid might look like. He added that other research suggests that a renewable grid \"has the potential to be more reliable and resilient than our current electric grid, since it would be less vulnerable to central disruptions.\"\nOur ruling\nTrump said, \"When the wind stops blowing, that\u2019s the end of your electric.\"\nIn virtually all cases, American energy consumers get their power from an interconnected grid, which pools together a portfolio of different generators. Practically speaking, just because the wind stops blowing in one place does not mean the whole grid goes down.\nRight now, renewables account for around 17 percent of total U.S. power. Experts say there are some legitimate practical and technological challenges associated with moving to a grid that relies much more heavily on renewable energy than our current system. But engineers are aware of the issues and many believe they are not insurmountable.\nWe rate Trump\u2019s statement Mostly False.\n Share the Facts 2019-04-03 21:40:42 UTC   PolitiFact    3 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly False  \"When the wind stops blowing, that\u2019s the end of your electric.\"    Donald Trump President https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-speech-cpac-convention-2019-march-2-2019   in a speech Saturday, March 2, 2019 2019-03-02    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00807"}
