At first, the woman is happy, enjoying the viewing. But then a man speeds up and goes beyond warning signs and rushes towards a slope. When it reaches the edge, it filters on the wheelchair, and the woman falls heavily on the edge. The man walks quietly away. The Declaration does not contain any dialogue, and therefore its point of view is put forward through a series of overextended statements. \"In 1965, Americans made medical care in law. Today, medical care provides health insurance to 46 million Americans. More than half of Americans live in medical care on less than $28,000 a year. Now, the Republicans want to privatize medical care. Is America beautiful without medical attention?\" We have decided to verify two claims in this declaration. The first, which we will look at in a different item, is whether Ryan's plan will leave the country \"without medical care.\" And the second, which we're going to investigate here, is whether Ryan's budget proposal is going to allocate medical care. First, we will present a summary of Ryan &apos; s plan, which was approved by the House of Representatives in a vote close to the party and which recently prompted some Republicans to oppose it, amid fears that voters would not be comfortable with its approach. The Ryan plan would significantly reduce federal spending in the name of fiscal discipline. One of its main features is the radical restructuring of medical care, the Government-run health insurance programme for those aged 65 and over. Currently, the Medical Care Institution pays doctors and hospitals specific fees to the beneficiaries of the care they receive. The beneficiaries of medical care pay premiums for certain types of coverage, and younger workers contribute salary taxes. The Ryan Plan leaves medical care, as is the case for persons aged 55 and over. However, in 2022, new beneficiaries will be insured by private insurance companies instead of the Federal Government, although they will receive \"preliminary support\" - financial assistance from the Government to purchase insurance. People who need more health care will get more money. The proposal requires private insurers to accept all applicants and impose the same rate on persons of the same age. The plans will comply with the standards established by the United States Office of Personnel Management, which administers the federal staff health benefits programme. The plan gradually raises the age of entitlement to medical care to 67 years and provides less support for high-income people. In analysing the claim that Ryan's plan is privatizing medical care, we see at least three questions for consideration, based on our discussions with a group of policy experts: how do you know \"privatization\"? When we contacted Erica Payne, the founder and president of the draft agenda, she defended the use of \"privatization\" on the grounds that under the current system, the buyer was the government and the seller was the health provider, while under Ryan's plan, the buyer would be the patient and the seller the insurance company. \"Because the seller's choice is now in the hands of an individual whose essence would be to \"seek\" a private company's insurance plan, this change will have the effect of transforming medical care into a private insurance system.\" \"In this way, we conclude that this plan seeks to \"privatize\" medical care. The replacement of a government system that pays directly for interest with a scheme that integrates private companies into the exchange of goods and services seems to be a fairly uniform interpretation of the concept of privatization.\" Is she right? There are in fact a number of definitions of privatization, but Stephen Perry, an economist from Yale University, said that at least one common definition seems to fit what he calls \"Ryankari.\" Paul Starr, a liberal professor of sociology and public policy, wrote in Perry's article on an article in the 1988 Law Journal that an accepted definition of the term \"privatization\" is \"instead of producing some services directly, the government may finance special services, for example, by contracting out or coupons.\" While the Congressional Bureau of Budget followed Ryan's leadership in calling subsidies \"Purpose of the Virgin\" instead of \"The Homeless,\" Perry said that the definition still applied. \"Ryan's plan takes some of the jobs currently provided by the Government and transfers them to insurance companies in the private sector, and provides a government subsidy to pay for private sector services,\" he said. \"Ryan is clear on this subject -- he believes that the private sector will do better in these activities than the \"mopolistic\" government agency. This is a traditional argument in favour of this kind of privatization.\" Is medical care completely public now? In many important ways, medical care is today's public program. Payments to doctors are made with government funds and are collected through compulsory tax estimates. There is a large bureaucracies called Medical Care Centres and Medical Assistance Services which set standards for the programme and implement enforcement. However, Robert Moffet, a senior colleague of the Conservative Heritage Foundation, notes that medical care - despite its reputation as a one-time health care model - has some noteworthy aspects that are particularly accurate. \"The entire system of medical care delivery -- doctors, hospitals, home health care agencies, nursing homes, hospital care facilities -- almost all of them are clients or private institutions.\" Moffet said. \"Exceptions include district hospitals or public hospitals that pay for the treatment of medical care patients.\" In addition, most of those enrolled in the medical care programme have supplementary insurance to cover costs not borne by the programme, most of which are either purchased from the private market or insured by employers. The Medical Care Benefits Program, which represents about a quarter of those enrolled in medical care, is managed by private insurers using medical care funds. About 60 per cent of older persons are enrolled in special drug plans in the Medical Care Part D programme. Finally, the Federal Government already manages medical care through private contractors, usually large private insurance companies dealing with medical care claims. So while Ryan's plan will turn the needle into the private sector more than it is today, it is important to remember that medical care today is not just a government program without a private sector role. How much of the government's role will remain under Ryan's plan? :: Connor Sweeney, Ryan &apos; s spokesman, confirms that medical care will retain important governmental aspects under the proposal. \"The government continues to collect salary taxes to fund future medical care for older persons,\" said Sweeney. \"It provides financial support to ensure future coverage of older persons. It strictly regulates the plans that older persons choose in the future from among them, so that they are protected from discriminatory pricing. Under our plan, the medical care programme continues to be a government programme dedicated to helping achieve health security for older persons in America. The real question about medical care is not whether the government should be involved, is how much power should the government have over individual health care decisions?\" Many economists with experience in privatization issues have told us that there is sufficient evidence to suggest a privatization plan for Ryan. \"I'd like to say that privatization is a correct description of the plan process,\" said Ellen Daninen, a professor of law in Pennsylvania. \"It's not special in the sense that the mother shop and the pop shop are private, but instead, it works more or less as an organized and heavily supported private industry. Because a person who reaches the age of admission to medical care after the date of submission of the invoice would not have the capacity to register for medical care (as currently drafted), it seems that their only option would be to take payment of the plan and register in a special plan provided by an insurance company.\" Roger Noel, an economist at Stanford University, said that Ryan's plan would clearly shift duties to pay expenses from a federal agency to a private insurance company. The Government &apos; s work providing regulatory oversight was not the same as that of the Government providing services. Noel added that confusion on the issue might arise from an inaccurate understanding of how medical care actually worked. \"Health care and insurance are separate services,\" he said. \"Medical care is always dependent on the privatization of health care. What is being privatized in Ryan's plan is health insurance services.\" So where does this leave us? It is true that, under Ryan &apos; s proposal, the Government will retain important duties in the Department of Medical Care. But \"privatization\" should not mean that the Government has nothing more to do with the project. Under long-standing definitions, privatization can take place without the Government giving up its right to regulate a service provided by the private sector, such as an electrical facility. However, we believe it is fair to note that medical care already provides some kind of coverage through private insurance now, so the shift towards the private sector stimulated by the Ryan Plan will be more of a matter of degree than of type. Overall, we conclude that the idea that Paul Ryan's budget proposal \"will allocate medical care\" is often correct. On January 13, 2021, the distinguished fact-finding bloggers announced in a story in which General David H. Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for the use of marines for inaugural security, saying, \"We are not working for you.\"", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13041"}
