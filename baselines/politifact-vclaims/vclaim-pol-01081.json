Our reporting found that Schultz\u2019s claim is on the right track, although he overstated it a bit.\nThis is not the first time we have checked a claim about American finances from Schultz\u2019s shop. In 2015, Starbucks published an eight-page insert in USA Today explaining why it wanted to start a national conversation about race. It included this statistic: \"White people control almost 90 percent of the nation's wealth.\" We rated it True. It matched the latest net worth figures from the Federal Reserve System at the time.\nHeard that \u201840 percent\u2019 before?\nSchultz\u2019s 40 percent statement reminded us of something former Washington Post reporter Hunter Schwarz said in 2015 before joining CNN. Schwarz said that 47 percent of Americans \"can\u2019t pay for an unexpected $400 expense through savings or credit cards, without selling something or borrowing money.\" PunditFact rated that claim True.\nAs our colleagues reported, Schwarz\u2019s statement was based on results of a nationally representative sample of American adults who completed an online survey in October 2014 by the Federal Reserve Board. When asked how they would pay for an emergency expense of $400, 53 percent said they would be able to pay essentially immediately, while 47 percent said they could not.\nBut that\u2019s based on a survey taken more than four years before Schultz made his statement, and the reporter\u2019s statement was somewhat more precise.\nSo, let\u2019s dig in.\nNewer figures\nWe didn\u2019t hear back from Schultz\u2019s office about what he used as the basis for his statement. But the Fed has done its survey, in what is known as the \"Report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households,\" each year since 2013. And the most recent results, released in May 2018, got coverage from NPR, CNBC, Forbes, Fox Business and other national media.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new survey, conducted in November and December 2017 with more than 12,000 respondents, found that:\n\"Four in 10 adults, if faced with an unexpected expense of $400, would either not be able to cover it or would cover it by selling something or borrowing money.\"\nSo, that isn\u2019t direct evidence that 40 percent of Americans don\u2019t have at least $400 in a bank account.\nBut, based on the survey, the 40 percent didn\u2019t have that much in their checking or savings; or, they said they would resort instead to borrowing or selling something to cover the expense.\nThe Fed noted that 40 percent was an improvement from half of adults in 2013 being ill-prepared for such an expense.\nTwo points worth noting before we close:\n\u2022 An April 2018 report by the Global Financial Literacy Excellence Center at George Washington University found that 36 percent of the population couldn\u2019t come up with $2,000 within the next month to cover an emergency expense \u2014\u00a0a measure the report said is similar to being able to come up with $400 immediately.\n\u2022 Given the drop in unemployment and generally good economy, the figure might now be lower than the 40 percent cited in the Fed survey, Marquette University emeritus economics professor Abdur Chowdhury told us.\nOur ruling\nSchultz\u00a0said\u00a0\"over 40 percent of the American people don't have $400 in the bank.\"\nBased on the latest survey from the Federal Reserve Board, Schultz is essentially on track: 40 percent of Americans said that, if faced with an emergency expense of $400, they would not be able to cover it, or would have to borrow or sell something in order to cover it.\nWe rate Schultz's statement Mostly True.
