At the time, March 2012, the claim had some numerical validity but was also cherry-picked and flawed. We rated it Mostly False.\nWe reached out to the Fiorina campaign and did not hear back, so we\u2019re not sure if she based her statement on the same data as Romney\u2019s campaign used.\nBut here\u2019s what we found back in April 2012: Between January 2009 and March 2012, the total drop in employment was, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 740,000. In the same period, employment for women fell by 683,000.\nDo the division and you get 92.3 percent.\nA big problem with the claim in 2012 was that it cherry-picked the starting date for assessing Obama\u2019s jobs track record. The recession began in December 2007, and he didn\u2019t take office until January 2009, when it was nearly over. It\u2019s difficult to blame any president for the economic situation he inherited.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Boysko\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in a committee debate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe United States is the only industrialized, modernized country that does not already have a paid family medical leave program in place.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bigger problem with Fiorina making the same statement today is that Obama\u2019s first term continued for another 10 months. \u00a0During that time, the women job numbers did a U-turn and became a net gain.\nThe government data show an increase of 416,000 working women between January 2009 and January 2013. Total employment also rose by 1.3 million. So more women actually were working at the end of Obama\u2019s first term compared with the day he first took office.\nWe used the January 2009 to January 2013 timeframe to be consistent with the original Republican framing of the critique of Obama\u2019s economic policies.\nOur ruling\nFiorina said 92 percent of the jobs lost during Obama\u2019s first term belonged to women. By January 2013, the jobs numbers don\u2019t back it up at all. The number of women with jobs increased by 416,000 during Obama\u2019s first term.\nWe rate this claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05797"}
