In the past I\u2019ve been reluctant to publicly voice my political opinions, but due to several events in my life and in the world in the past two years, I feel very differently about that now. I always have and always will cast my vote based on which candidate will protect and fight for the human rights I believe we all deserve in this country. I believe in the fight for LGBTQ rights, and that any form of discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender is WRONG. I believe that the systemic racism we still see in this country towards people of color is terrifying, sickening and prevalent. I cannot vote for someone who will not be willing to fight for dignity for ALL Americans, no matter their skin color, gender or who they love. Running for Senate in the state of Tennessee is a woman named Marsha Blackburn. As much as I have in the past and would like to continue voting for women in office, I cannot support Marsha Blackburn. Her voting record in Congress appalls and terrifies me. She voted against equal pay for women. She voted against the Reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which attempts to protect women from domestic violence, stalking, and date rape. She believes businesses have a right to refuse service to gay couples. She also believes they should not have the right to marry. These are not MY Tennessee values. I will be voting for Phil Bredesen for Senate and Jim Cooper for House of Representatives. Please, please educate yourself on the candidates running in your state and vote based on who most closely represents your values. For a lot of us, we may never find a candidate or party with whom we agree 100% on every issue, but we have to vote anyway. So many intelligent, thoughtful, self-possessed people have turned 18 in the past two years and now have the right and privilege to make their vote count. But first you need to register, which is quick and easy to do. October 9th is the LAST DAY to register to vote in the state of TN. Go to vote.org and you can find all the info. Happy Voting! \ud83d\uddf3\ud83d\ude03\ud83c\udf08 A post shared by  Taylor Swift (@taylorswift) on Oct 7, 2018 at 4:33pm PDT \nBlackburn, Swift said, \"terrifies\" her.\n\"She voted against equal pay for women,\" Swift wrote. \"She voted against the Reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which attempts to protect women from domestic violence, stalking, and date rape.\"\nHere, we look at whether Blackburn in fact voted against reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act.\nBlackburn did vote against the bill, but she voted in favor of a Republican alternative. The differences were not great, but they hung on the very issue of gender orientation that Swift wrote about.\nThe 2013 controversy\nThe Violence Against Women Act was two decades old in 2013 when Congress wrestled with renewing the funds to support it. The law paid for programs to prevent domestic violence. It provided money to investigate and prosecute rape and other crimes against women. It supported counseling for victims.\nThe $630 million price tag was less the problem than some specific language on non-discrimination.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL. Lin Wood\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in an interview with the Patriotically Correct Radio Show\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"China was behind the interference and the effort to overthrow our government and the election, election fraud.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Daniel Funke \u2022 January 19, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Senate approved its bill first on Feb. 12, 2013, by a wide bipartisan margin of 78 to 22. That measure redefined underserved populations to include those who might be discriminated against based on religion, sexual orientation or gender identity.\nThere were also changes in the recognition of the authority of Native American tribes to enforce the law within the tribal justice system. When the bill came over to the House, a key sticking point had to do with orientation and identity.\nHouse Republicans crafted a version of the legislation that omitted the sexual orientation and gender protections. The American Bar Association opposed the GOP version, saying \"the House substitute eliminates certain critical improvements.\"\nDomestic violence shelters in some southern states said they had heard from governors\u2019 offices that they couldn\u2019t use federal funds for LGBTQ victims because the law didn\u2019t explicitly say they were covered.\n\"You show up bleeding at the door and we\u2019re going to address the bleeding, not stop to ask about your sexual orientation or gender identity first,\" said Ruth Glenn, CEO of the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence. \"We didn\u2019t want programs to lose their funding because they didn\u2019t do triage on that basis.\"\nThe House Republican version failed by a vote of 166 to 257. The nay votes included 60 Republicans.\nBlackburn voted in favor of the Republican measure.\nThe Senate version, the one that ultimately became law, came up next and passed 286 to 138. The bill had picked up 27 additional Republican votes. Blackburn voted no.\nWe reached out to Blackburn\u2019s office for comment and did not hear back.\nOur ruling\nSwift said Blackburn voted against reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act. Blackburn voted no on the final version that became law.\nShe did vote for a Republican alternative that lacked discrimination protections based on sexual orientation and gender identity. While there were other issues, over two dozen Republicans decided that it was better to fund the act than to continue to oppose the nondiscrimination provisions. Blackburn was not one of them.\nWe rate the claim Mostly True.\n Share the Facts 2018-10-09 17:04:58 UTC   PolitiFact    5 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly True  Says Marsha Blackburn \"voted against the Reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which attempts to protect women from domestic violence, stalking, and date rape.\"    Taylor Swift Mega pop star https://www.instagram.com/p/BopoXpYnCes/?hl=en   In an Instagram post.
