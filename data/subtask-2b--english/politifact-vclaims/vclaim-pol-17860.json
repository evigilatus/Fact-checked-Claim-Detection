(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe post is not tied to Black Lives Matter in any way. Black activists in Fresno have categorically denied that they have made plans to riot in Fresno on the afternoon of June 2.\u00a0\nChris Milton, a businessman who spoke at a peaceful protest of George Floyd\u2019s death on Sunday in Fresno, said during a Facebook Live video that the post was not affiliated with Black Lives Matter.\n\"There\u2019s some stuff going around right now where there\u2019s supposed to be this planned riot,\" Milton said. \"It\u2019s fake. That has absolutely nothing to do with Black Lives Matter. That is not a Black Lives Matter movement.\"\nHe added that the peaceful protest that occurred in downtown Fresno on Sunday was \"the movement from the black population here in Fresno.\" He emphasized that black activists in Fresno are prioritizing keeping the peace.\u00a0\n\"It\u2019s not about tearing up businesses, it\u2019s not about disabling infrastructure,\" Milton said. \"Don\u2019t fall for the hype.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe attributed the post to white nationalist groups that have been angered by seeing black and white Americans unite for a common cause.\u00a0\nThe Fresno State University NAACP chapter also took to social media to discourage people from participating in the riots described in the Facebook post.\u00a0\n\"The Fresno State NAACP does NOT condone this event,\" the tweet reads. \"We are encouraging people DO NOT ATTEND this event for the safety of all.\"\nD\u2019Aungillique Jackson, president of the Fresno State NAACP chapter, also addressed the post in an Instagram video, encouraging people not to participate in the riots.\n\"That flyer is bogus. Do not go out there and tear up this city,\" Jackson said. She said the post was made by people who were \"impostering the Black Lives Matter movement.\"\nJackson\u2019s Instagram post also notes that Fresno doesn\u2019t have a Black Lives Matter chapter. The only California-based official chapters of the Black Lives Matter organization can be found in Los Angeles and Long Beach.\nPolice response\nBy Monday afternoon the Fresno Police Department said it was aware of the post about the planned riot. The department posted a statement on Facebook.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"We have dedicated several resources to tracking the validity of this threat and we are working towards a peaceful solution to any group that may want to be heard in our community,\" read the Facebook post.\u00a0\nA few hours later, Fresno Police Chief Andrew Hall posted a news release on Facebook addressing the post about the riots.\n\"I will be adjusting the mission of several units and there will be increased patrols and tactical units addressing the City\u2019s commercial businesses,\" Hall said in the news release.\nAir support, undercover units and tactical units would be prepared and acting as \"a watchful eye on those who would victimize\" the city, Hall said. He declined to recommend a curfew, saying his community \"just successfully had one of the largest peaceful demonstrations in this country.\"\nOur Rating\nA post suggests that a Black Lives Matter Group in Fresno has planned a riot for Tuesday afternoon with the goal of destroying infrastructure and sending a message to police.\u00a0\nBlack activists in Fresno have denounced the riot post, discouraged people from attending and said it was not organized by a Black Lives Matter group. Fresno police are investigating the threat, but do not see fit to issue a curfew for the city at this time.\u00a0\nWe rate this post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17860"}
