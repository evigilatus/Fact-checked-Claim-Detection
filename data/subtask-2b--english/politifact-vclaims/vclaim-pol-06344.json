They\u2019re a huge threat,\" Painter said, \"because it is an avenue of approach to get into the U.S.\"\nOur eyes clamped on what Painter said next: \"We\u2019re the only nation in the world that does not use the military to secure our border. We\u2019re not serious about it.\"\nBy phone, Painter told us the United States is one of the few nations in the world not using the military to secure the border. He said he based his declaration on news reports showing military forces on the borders of other countries. \"All you\u2019ve got to do is look at the news on TV,\" Painter said. \"You see it.\" He said he didn\u2019t remember which countries he saw on those news reports.\nExperts say not so\nIn contrast, experts we consulted called the Texan\u2019s statement a substantial exaggeration.\nThat said, some countries have heavy military presences on national borders, such as the forces watching over the demilitarized zone dividing North and South Korea. Separately, Israel\u2019s 7,500-member Border Police, a branch of the Israel National Police, deals with problems relating to public security, terror, severe crime, rioting, guarding sensitive sites and securing rural areas, according to Israel\u2019s Ministry of Public Security.\nIn Mexico, a mix of agencies rely on the Army and Navy and the federal police to watch over its borders, Christopher Wilson of the Mexico Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars told us by phone. But, Wilson said, Mexico\u2019s ports of entry are run by the country\u2019s customs service with immigration-related security managed by its Instituto de Migracion. The military branches provide security at the ports as needed, Wilson said, and also are in charge of stopping and catching traffickers in drugs and people.\nWilson said numerous countries similarly rely on military forces to pitch in near international borders in part because some border zones are isolated and other agencies don\u2019t have the manpower. He offered as examples of strong military presences Guatemala and Brazil.\nThen again, Ross Burkhart, a Boise State University professor, told us by email, countries don\u2019t deploy troops on borders unless they\u2019re engaged in cross-border conflicts \"that necessitate emergency border management procedures. Weak states in sub-Saharan Africa have most recently fallen into this category,\" Burkhart said.\nLance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University in Lawton, Okla., said by phone that Canada and Costa Rica, which has border guards but no regular military, are examples of the many countries that do not secure their respective borders with the military. Then again, many countries have border-area checkpoints run by officers with weapons, he said. Commenting on the sheriff\u2019s mention of TV news reports, Janda said: \"Anything on the news is going to be violence, right? They\u2019re not going to say nothing happened today on the border between Vietnam and Laos.\"\nU.S. Homeland Security\nFor our part, we checked on how the United States regulates border security, then peeked at how Canada does so. In both instances, the military has not been the primary agency handling border safety.\nBy email, Wilson said civilian law enforcement agencies handle U.S. border security. Still, he said, \"we have securitized border management, rolling customs and immigration functions into agencies that have law enforcement and national security at the heart of their mission.\"\nOn its website, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security says it \"secures the nation's air, land, and sea borders to prevent illegal activity while facilitating lawful travel and trade.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHomeland Security\u2019s border security overview says U.S. Customs officials and a record 21,000-plus Border Patrol \"agents, agriculture specialists, Air and Marine agents, and officers guard America\u2019s front lines. These men and women prevent terrorists and their weapons from entering the United States while continuing their mission of seizing contraband and apprehending criminals and others who illegally attempt to enter the United States.\"\nOther Homeland Security agencies relevant to border security include the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), responsible for criminal and civil enforcement of federal laws governing border control, customs, trade and immigration and the Transportation Security Administration.\nSo, the U.S. military doesn\u2019t lead the charge on border security, which is in keeping with the Posse Comitatus Act, passed into law in 1878, which barred the Army from being employed to execute laws unless otherwise authorized by Congress or the Constitution. Still, Homeland Security has a military component: the United States Coast Guard is entrusted with defending the country\u2019s maritime borders.\nAnd it\u2019s not as if military forces don\u2019t get called in. The non-partisan Congressional Research Service said in a February 2013 report, \"Although the military does not have primary responsibility to secure the borders, the Armed Forces generally provide support to law enforcement and immigration authorities along the southern border.\"\nSince the 1980s, the report said, U.S. forces including the National Guard, as authorized by Congress, have conducted a wide variety of counterdrug support missions along the borders of the United States.\" The Defense Department\u2019s \"support role in counterdrug and counterterrorism efforts appears to have increased the department\u2019s profile in border security,\" the report said. Also, Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama each authorized National Guard troops to help watch the border with Mexico, the report said.\nCanada\nWe didn\u2019t have to venture far to find another country that doesn\u2019t police its borders with the military. Canada\u2019s Border Services Agency says it \"ensures the security and prosperity of Canada by managing the access of people and goods to and from Canada.\" Broadly, the agency says it\u2019s \"responsible for providing integrated border services that support national security and public safety priorities.\"\nWe spotted no mention of Canada\u2019s armed forces being involved in border security. They\u2019re not, academic experts told us. Burkhart, who helps direct Boise State\u2019s Canadian Studies program, said by email the Canada Border Services Agency handles such duties with support from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in concert with the U.S. Coast Guard under the joint law enforcement \"Shiprider\" maritime security program in the Great Lakes and the Pacific Northwest. \"The Canadian Forces, the name for the Canadian military, does not participate in border enforcement,\" Burkhart said.\nOther nations\nTo our inquiry about countries using the military to secure borders, Peter Andreas, a Brown University professor, singled out Germany as a country whose military doesn\u2019t secure the border. \"Of course,\" Andreas said by email, \"all nations that have a military would use the military if there were a military attack from another country.\"\nIn the same vein, Edward Alden, a senior fellow at the Washington, D.C.-based Council on Foreign Relations, called the sheriff\u2019s claim ridiculous. \"Almost all advanced countries use law enforcement officials who are much like our own Border Patrol and Coast Guard,\" Alden emailed.\nBy email, Denmark-based author Frank Jacobs advised that most European Union countries don't use the military to secure their borders. He said the Schengen Area describes the EU states and even a few non-EU nations where business people and tourists can freely circulate without being subjected to border checks. Anyone crossing into the United Kingdom faces border checks, he said, though those are handled by Her Majesty's Border Force, which is not a military force, but an agency of the Home Office (Ministry of the Interior). He said that travelers returning to the Schengen Area have to pass through the French douane, but that is not a military unit, instead a part of the Ministry for the Budget, Public Accounts and the Civil Service.\nJanda followed up by email, calling the sheriff\u2019s statement \"demonstrably false. Most countries in the world use national law enforcement to police their borders just like we do.\" He added: \"The only countries that rely on their military to police/defend their borders are nations facing severe instability involving lawlessness and/or refugees in neighboring countries and/or open warfare.\"\nOur ruling\nPainter said the U.S. stands alone in the world in not using the military to secure \"our border.\"\nWe didn\u2019t have to go far to prove Painter wrong. Canada is one of many countries that rely on federal patrols, not the military, to handle border oversight, just as the United States does. The sheriff might\u2019ve seen some border-guarder troops in war-torn lands in TV news reports, but that\u2019s not factual basis for this claim.\nPants on Fire!\n\nPANTS ON FIRE \u2013 The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06344"}
