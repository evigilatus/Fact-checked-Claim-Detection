There\u2019s been a robust debate over whether Mitt Romney has flip-flopped on this question. In this item, we\u2019ll try to determine whether he has.\n\nWe\u2019ll start by noting that the Flip-O-Meter rates politicians' consistency on particular topics from No Flip to Full Flop. The meter is not intended to pass judgment on their decisions to change their minds. It\u2019s simply gauging whether they did.\n\nRomney\u2019s campaign website is silent on climate change. But in Romney\u2019s 2010 book No Apology: The Case for American Greatness, he wrote that \"I believe that climate change is occurring \u2014 the reduction in the size of global ice caps is hard to ignore. I also believe that human activity is a contributing factor. I am uncertain how much of the warming, however, is attributable to factors out of our control.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThen, in a town hall in New Hampshire in June 2011, a voter asked Romney whether he thought climate change existed and was caused by human activity. Here\u2019s part of Romney\u2019s answer (the full exchange can be seen on C-SPAN starting at the 21:00 mark):\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\"I don't speak for the scientific community, of course. But I believe the world is getting warmer. I can't prove that, but I believe based on what I read that the world is getting warmer. And number two, I believe that humans contribute to that. I don\u2019t know how much our contribution is to that, because I know there have been periods of greater heat and warmth in the past, but I believe that we contribute to that. So I think it's important for us to reduce our emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases that may well be significant contributors to the climate change and the global warming that you're seeing.\"\n\nRomney added that he opposed the United States unilaterally adopting a cap-and-trade plan if other countries weren\u2019t taking similar steps to reduce greenhouse emissions. A cap-and-trade plan would require industry to pay for their carbon emissions with new permit fees. There would be a limited amount of permits (the \"cap\"), but companies would be able to buy and sell the permits among themselves (the \"trade\").\n\nLater, in an Aug. 24, 2011, event in Lebanon, N.H., Romney said, \"Do I think the world's getting hotter? Yeah, I don't know that, but I think that it is. I don't know if it's mostly caused by humans. \u2026 What I'm not willing to do is spend trillions of dollars on something I don't know the answer to.\"\n\nAnd Romney discussed the issue in an Oct. 3, 2011, interview with reporters and editors of the New Hampshire Union Leader. (It was recorded here by C-SPAN; check around the 22-minute mark.)\n\nRomney said, \"One, I believe what I said before, I think it's getting warmer. Two, I believe we contribute to it. And three, I don't know by how much -- a lot or a little. And so I am not willing to adopt multi-trillion dollar programs to reduce greenhouse gases in America. They don't call it America warming, they call it global warming.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nBoth the book excerpt and the three New Hampshire comments suggest pretty clearly that Romney sees a role for humans in climate change, though he\u2019s less committal about how large an impact humans are having.\n\nBut at a campaign event in Pittsburgh, Pa., a few months later, Romney offered a somewhat different perspective. His comments were videotaped and promoted by the liberal advocacy website Think Progress.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nA voter asked Romney, \"What is your position on man-made global warming and would you reject legislation, such as cap and trade, which is based on the idea of man-made global warming?\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\"My view is that we don\u2019t know what\u2019s causing climate change on this planet. And the idea of spending trillions and trillions of dollars to try to reduce CO2 emissions is not the right course for us. My view with regards to energy policy is pretty straightforward. I want us to become energy secure and independent of the oil cartels. And that means let\u2019s aggressively develop our oil, our gas, our coal, our nuclear power.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nMuch of Romney\u2019s underlying policy proposals -- reducing foreign oil dependence; increasing the use of natural gas and nuclear power; and opposing cap-and-trade \u00a0-- remained the same in both comments.\n\nBut this time he left out human activity as a cause of global warming. Rather than saying, as he had in the past, that we don\u2019t know how much of a role humans are playing in climate, Romney said, \"We don\u2019t know what\u2019s causing climate change on this planet.\"\n\nAfter Romney\u2019s remarks were widely reported, Romney spokeswoman Andrea Saul told the Boston Globe that Romney was not flip-flopping.\n\n\"This is ridiculous,\" she said in a statement. \"Gov. Romney\u2019s view on climate change has not changed. He believes it\u2019s occurring, and that human activity contributes to it, but he doesn\u2019t know to what extent. He opposes cap and trade, and he refused to sign such a plan when he was governor.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWe were unable to find any remarks since then about whether he thought human beings contribute to global warming or not.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nOur ruling\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIn June 2011, Romney said he believed \"the world is getting warmer\" and that \"humans contribute to that.\" In October 2011, by contrast, Romney said that \"we don\u2019t know what\u2019s causing climate change on this planet.\"\n\nIt\u2019s unclear to us whether this was an inadvertent omission or a calculated attempt to say divergent things to different audiences. Because Romney, in our view, is savvy enough to know the difference between suggesting a human role in climate change and leaving it out, we think it\u2019s reasonable to perceive Romney as taking two distinct stances in these two statements. We rate this a Half Flip.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11090"}
