That\u2019s about 34 million pounds every day. Ever wonder what this costs you as a taxpayer? Millions? Tens of millions? Hundreds of millions?\" a voice says in the 30-second ad.\n\nThe answer: \"Not a single cent.\"\n\nDeliveries are solely funded by stamps and postage, the voice says.\n\nThe ad was put together by the American Postal Workers Union. The union writes on its website that the ad was created to combat \"detrimental legislation.\"\n\nThe Postal Service boasts that nothing will keep its mail carriers from their appointed rounds. We at PolitiFact Georgia share a similar intrepid ethic regarding getting to the bottom of a claim. So what did we find?\n\nThe Postal Service says on the facts page of its website that it does not receive tax dollars for its operations, but some context is necessary here.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s look at its current situation.\n\nBefore 1971, the Postal Service received annual appropriations from the federal government. Since then, it has operated independently, with revenues generated through the sales of postage stamps and services.\n\nBut Congress does give the Postal Service $100 million a year to compensate the agency for revenue loss by providing, at congressional direction, free mailing privileges to blind people and overseas voters, a congressional report noted. The $100 million is less than 1 percent of the Postal Service\u2019s annual budget.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn McCallum\n\n\nstated on March 18, 2014 in a video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A child born in America today will inherit $1.5 million in debt the moment they're placed in their mother's arms.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Stirgus \u2022 March 26, 2014\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2012, the Postal Service pulled in about $65 billion in revenue, it says on its website. That\u2019s $10 billion less than what collected in 2008, the year the Great Recession took hold. By some reports, the Postal Service is losing $25 million a day. The volume of mail the Postal Service handles has declined by nearly 27 percent since 2008, as Americans rely more on email \u00a0communications instead of letters.\n\nThe Postal Service\u2019s debt rose from nothing to $10.2 billion between federal fiscal years 2005 and 2009, according to a congressional report. The federal fiscal year begins Oct. 1 and concludes Sept. 30.\n\nAnother congressional report found Postal Service operating costs may be the largest reason for its financial troubles. In 2006, Congress passed legislation requiring the Postal Service to pre-fund its future retirees\u2019 health benefits at a cost of approximately $5.6 billion per year.\n\nThe Postal Service has cut expenses through a hiring freeze, offering early retirement to longtime employees and closing some district offices. It\u2019s also increased revenue in recent years through several increases in the price of a postage stamp.\n\nIn 2009, the Postal Service began borrowing money from the U.S. Treasury Department to deal with its troubles. Some news accounts report the service reached its borrowing limit of $15 billion in September 2012.\n\nSally Davidow, a spokeswoman for the union, said the Postal Service had to borrow the money to offset the health benefit changes. She argued that health benefits are not part of the Postal Service\u2019s operating expenses.\n\n\"(The Postal Service) is required to pay that money back,\" Davidow added. \"Borrowing money is different than relying on taxpayers.\"\n\nDavidow argued in the union\u2019s defense that the Postal Service has $46 billion in its retiree health benefits fund, but the federal government won\u2019t let the agency borrow from it.\n\nThe Postal Service wrote in a November 2012 press release that it had a record fiscal year deficit of nearly $16 billion. The agency attributed about 70 percent of that net loss to the health care requirement.\n\nTo sum up, the American Postal Workers Union claimed in its television ad that the U.S. Postal Service doesn\u2019t operate on taxpayer dollars and and it\u2019s solely funded by stamps and postage. The Postal Service has borrowed money from the government in recent years, primarily it says, to cover the cost to pre-fund employee health benefits.\n\nThe first part of the statement is on target. The second part, however, gets a return to sender.\n\nWe rate this claim Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09076"}
