The virus\u2019 genome, she said, indicates that it was modified. She accused the Chinese Communist Party of silencing those who claim otherwise.\n\"It\u2019s hard to be shocked in a moment like this, but you have succeeded in shocking me,\" Carlson said at the end of the interview. \"Unfortunately, this is not the forum for the details of your research; I don\u2019t have the grounding necessary to ask you the right questions.\"\nScientists do. The consensus of the scientific community and international public health organizations is that the coronavirus emerged from bats and later jumped to humans.\nBut the doctor\u2019s interview on \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\"\u00a0quickly took off, inspiring a rash of social media posts parroting her claims.\n\"Just now on Tucker Carlson it was revealed that CORONAVIRUS was CREATED in Wuhan Lab and released INTENTIONALLY,\" says a Sept. 15 Facebook post.\nSome of those posts were flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nAfter Fox aired its interview with Yan, Facebook labeled the clip \u2014\u00a0which was posted on the official \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" page and shared tens of thousands of times \u2014 as false information. It was also flagged on Instagram.\nBut how do we know Yan\u2019s claims about the coronavirus are wrong \u2014\u00a0and where do they come from? Let\u2019s review the facts.\nClaims run\u00a0counter to scientific evidence\nScientists worldwide have publicly shared the genetic makeup of the coronavirus thousands of times. If the virus had been altered, there would be evidence in its genome data.\nBut there isn\u2019t. In March, several microbiology, infectious disease and evolutionary biology experts wrote in Nature \u2014\u00a0a respected scientific journal \u2014 that the genetic makeup of the coronavirus does not indicate it was altered.\u00a0\nInstead, scientists have two plausible explanations for the origin of the virus: natural selection in an animal host, or natural selection in humans after the virus jumped from animals\n\"Our analyses clearly show that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus,\" the researchers wrote.\nSince that article was published, public health authorities have repeatedly said the coronavirus was not derived from a lab:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharlie Kirk\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Joe Biden admits he is governing like a 'dictator.'\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Daniel Funke \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"All available evidence suggests the virus has an animal origin and is not manipulated or constructed in a lab or somewhere else,\" said World Health Organization spokeswoman Fadela Chaib at an April press briefing. \"It is probable, likely, that the virus is of animal origin.\"\n\n\n\"If you look at the evolution of the virus in bats and what's out there now, (the scientific evidence) is very, very strongly leaning toward this could not have been artificially or deliberately manipulated,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told National Geographic in May.\n\n\n\"The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir,\" according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\nThat doesn\u2019t rule out the possibility that Chinese researchers were studying the virus in a lab when it managed to spread outside the lab, which is something that the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency has considered. But the agency has also said there is \"no credible evidence to indicate SARS-CoV-2 was released intentionally or was created as a biological weapon.\"\nWe reached out to Fox News and the email listed on Yan\u2019s paper for comment. The virologist didn\u2019t get back to us.\u00a0\nCarly Shanahan, vice president of media relations for Fox News, told us that Carlson will address the segment on his Sept. 16 show.\u00a0\n\"Facebook is working hard to make sure you\u2019re unable to see our latest post regarding a coronavirus whistleblower,\" wrote \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" in a related Facebook post. \"This is censorship, and we will be addressing it on our show tonight at 8pm ET on Fox News.\"\nResearch backed by political operatives\nThe evidence that Yan cited during her interview with Carlson was backed by nonprofit organizations linked to Steve Bannon and an exiled Chinese billionaire.\nYan has published papers about the transmission of COVID-19 in hamsters and the virus\u2019 shedding patterns in human patients, according to Google Scholar. She has claimed that she was among the first scientists to study the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan.\u00a0\nIn July interviews with Fox News, Yan accused the Chinese government of knowing about COVID-19 before it publicly acknowledged the virus, and said that her supervisors at the University of Hong Kong ignored some of her research findings. She fled to the United States in April to \"deliver the message of the truth of COVID,\" she said.\nBut the University of Hong Kong said in a July statement that Yan \"never conducted any research on human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus at HKU during December 2019 and January 2020.\"\n\"We further observe that what she might have emphasised in the reported interview has no scientific basis but resembles hearsay,\" the university wrote of Yan\u2019s interviews with Fox.\nRELATED: What we know about the source of the coronavirus pandemic\nMore recently, Yan co-published an article that suggests \"sophisticated laboratory modification\" of the coronavirus. The study was uploaded Sept. 14 to a website called Zenodo, an open-source repository of research \u2014\u00a0not a peer-reviewed journal. It\u2019s unclear whether the paper received any peer review.\nThe research is backed by the Rule of Law Society and the Rule of Law Foundation. The sister nonprofit organizations are connected to Steve Bannon, a former chief strategist for the Trump administration, and Guo Wengui, a billionaire and political activist who fled China in 2014 in anticipation of corruption charges from the Communist Party.\u00a0\nNeither organization has published scientific literature before, according to a Google Scholar search. A website linked to Bannon and Wengui has a history of making inaccurate claims about the coronavirus pandemic.\nOur ruling\nDuring an interview on Fox News, Yan said the coronavirus \"is a man-made virus created in the lab.\"\nThe genetic structure of the novel coronavirus, which has been shared by thousands of scientists worldwide, rules out the possibility that it was manipulated in a lab. Public health authorities have repeatedly said the virus was not created in a lab. Scientists believe the coronavirus originated in bats before jumping to humans. Experts have publicly rebuked Yan\u2019s paper, and it\u2019s unclear whether it was peer reviewed.\nThe claim is inaccurate and ridiculous.
