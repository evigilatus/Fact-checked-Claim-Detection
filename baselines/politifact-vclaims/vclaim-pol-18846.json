The shooting left him paralyzed from the waist down, according to his family.\u00a0\nTwo nights later, an Illinois teenager used an AR-15-style rifle to kill two protesters and injure a third, according to eyewitness videos and a criminal complaint.\nThe charges against Kyle Rittenhouse, 17, increased tensions in a city that was already on edge, with some condemning his actions and others saying he was protecting the city and only shot in self-defense.\nIn an Aug. 31, 2020 media briefing, on the eve of his visit to Kenosha, Trump defended Rittenhouse\u2019s actions when asked about the teenager.\u00a0\n\"You saw the same tape as I saw,\" Trump said. \"And he was trying to get away from them, I guess; it looks like. And he fell, and then they very violently attacked him. And it was something that we\u2019re looking at right now and it\u2019s under investigation.\"\nHe went on to say of Rittenhouse: \"I guess he was in very big trouble. He would have been \u2014 I \u2014 he probably would have been killed.\"\nThe president correctly describes some minor details about that night. But overall, his comments grossly mischaracterize what happened \u2014 leaving out that by the time of the events he described, prosecutors say Rittenhouse had already shot and killed a man.\nIn this fact-check, we are not examining the question of whether Rittenhouse acted in self-defense, as his attorney claims. We are examining whether Trump is providing an accurate description of what happened by focusing on only a portion of the events of that night.\nHe is not.\nLet\u2019s take a look.\u00a0\nHow the shootings unfolded\nDetails of the Aug. 25, 2020 shootings have emerged through eyewitness videos and a criminal complaint filed in Kenosha County Circuit Court.\u00a0\nHere\u2019s what we know:\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin LeMahieu\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a TV interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It takes quite a while on Election Day to load those ballots, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoseph Rosenbaum, 36, approached Rittenhouse and a reporter interviewing him that night and began to chase Rittenhouse after he did a \"juke\" move. Rosenbaum threw a plastic bag at Rittenhouse, but it didn\u2019t hit him.\u00a0\nThe two ended up in a parking lot, and the reporter told authorities that Rosenbaum tried to grab Rittenhouse\u2019s gun. Rittenhouse fired four shots, and Rosenbaum dropped to the ground in front of him.\nIn a video, Rittenhouse can be heard saying on his cell phone, \"I just killed someone.\"\nRittenhouse began running slowly down the street as a crowd began to follow him, with some people shouting \"get him!\" and shouting he just shot someone. Rittenhouse tripped and fell.\u00a0\nWhile he was on the ground, police say, he appeared to fire two shots at a man who jumped over him but missed.\u00a0\nAfter that, Anthony Huber, 26, ran up to Rittenhouse with a skateboard in one hand and appeared to hit him with it before reaching for Rittenhouse\u2019s gun. Rittenhouse fired one round that hit Huber in the chest and killed him.\nRittenhouse sat up and pointed his gun at Gaige Grosskreutz, 26, who had started to approach him. Grosskreutz took a step back and put his hands in the air, but then moved toward Rittenhouse, who fired a shot that hit Grosskreutz in the arm.\nGrosskreutz had a handgun. It is unclear whether Grosskreutz was pointing the gun at Rittenhouse, or if Rittenhouse saw that Grosskreutz had a gun.\nMissing information paints false picture\nTrump\u2019s comments completely overlook the fact that people started following him after he allegedly shot and killed someone. He also claimed protesters \"violently attacked\" Rittenhouse, but that is not fully supported by the videos, either.\nWitnesses say those who were chasing Rittenhouse were trying to stop him.\nRittenhouse later walked past a group of police vehicles, hands in the air, and ultimately returned home to nearby Antioch, Illinois, where he was arrested the next day.\nWhat\u2019s more, Trump suggested the matter is \"under investigation.\" But while Rittenhouse\u2019s attorney has indicated he would argue self defense, the teen has already been charged with homicide. It\u2019s unclear what, if any, investigation would still be open.\nEven before the comments, Trump drew headlines when he \"liked\" a tweet that said, \"Rittenhouse is a good example of why I decided to vote for Trump.\" Rittenhouse, who is in jail awaiting extradition to Kenosha to face charges, is a Trump supporter.\nOur ruling\nTrump said a video shows Rittenhouse \"was trying to get away from\" protesters\"\u00a0 and \"fell, and then they violently attacked him.\"\nRittenhouse did fall as a crowd followed him, but Trump\u2019s comments leave an incendiary and false picture: By the time he fell, according to criminal charges, Rittenhouse had already shot and killed one person that night.\u00a0\nWe rate the claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18846"}
