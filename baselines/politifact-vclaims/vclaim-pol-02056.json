You ever see her? 'We will impeach him! We will impeach the president!' But he hasn't done anything wrong. \u2018It doesn't matter, we will impeach him!\u2019 She's a low I.Q. individual. You can't help it. She really is.\"\nGiven Waters\u2019 role as a foil for Trump, she has become fodder for social media posts by Trump\u2019s allies.\nOne we came across was the following post that appeared on May 15, 2018, on the Facebook page \"Judge Jeanine Pirro has Fans.\" This Facebook group bills itself as an independent fan page for Pirro, a Fox News host who is closely allied with Trump.\nAccording to the Facebook group\u2019s \"about\" page, \"Judge Jeanine Pirro is out spoken and always on target. This site will expound on what the Judge is talking about and report what mainstream media won't.\" The group counted 713,110 followers when we first saw the post.\nThe post shows what appeared to be a screenshot of a CNN appearance by Waters with host Anderson Cooper. The chyron at the bottom of the screen said, \"Maxine Waters 2020,\" and the meme offered the following dialogue:\nAnderson: \"If elected what would your first act as President be?\"\nWaters: \"Well Anderson, I would impeach Donald Trump.\"\nThe group shared the image by saying, \"And we pay her a salary!\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHogan Gidley\n\n\nstated on January 17, 2021 in a Fox News interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump \u201ccan\u2019t say anything (about the U.S. Capitol riot) because the platforms have removed him.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 18, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe problem: Waters never said anything of the sort.\nThe image appears to be from a real newscast on April 19, 2017, when Cooper interviewed Waters about Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s departure from Fox News.\n.@MaxineWaters on O'Reilly: \"There's something wrong with him psychologically. ... I hope he seeks some help.\" https://t.co/zDEyMNNAqe\u2014 Anderson Cooper 360\u00b0 (@AC360) April 20, 2017\n\n\nBut the chyron \"Maxine Waters 2020\" is fake. The original chyron said, \"Bill O\u2019Reilly Out at Fox News.\"\nThe meme aims to make it look like Waters actually said that she would impeach Trump if elected president, which would be nonsensical. Obviously, there would be no need to impeach Trump if she either defeated him or succeeded him after he left office. Also, it\u2019s up to Congress to impeach the president.\n\nYou may not realize this, but as a nonprofit news organization,\u00a0we depend on \u2014 and answer to \u2014 you.

Go on the record as saying facts matter!\n\nWaters has\u00a0called for investigations that could lead to Trump\u2019s impeachment, but on several occasions \u2014 including an interview with the platform Cheddar and a rally at the U.S. Capitol \u2014 she called for Trump\u2019s impeachment directly. When she denied on MSNBC in April 2017 that she had called for Trump\u2019s impeachment, we rated her claim Pants on Fire.\nWe found no evidence that Waters is seriously considering a run for president. While she has occasionally joked about it, she shot down the idea during an appearance on The View in August 2017. (Her office did not respond to an inquiry for this article; nor did the administrator for the Pirro fan site)\nSnopes.com noted that the meme appeared elsewhere before the Pirro fan site picked it up. The faked dialogue seems to have initially started as a joke in a May 11 tweet, and a version with the Cooper-Waters visual was retweeted May 14 by Fox News host Brian Kilmeade (he added: \"genius\"), earning more than 900 retweets and more than 3,000 likes.\nOur ruling\nViral social media posts said Maxine Waters told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper that her first act as president would be to \"impeach Donald Trump.\"\nThis exchange never happened; it appears to have emerged as a joke that was eventually attached to a screenshot of an unrelated interview. In any case, the comments are nonsensical and may have more to do with making Waters look unintelligent than with the actual impeachment process.\nWe rate it Pants on Fire.\n Share the Facts 2018-05-17 22:12:41 UTC   PolitiFact    1 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Pants on Fire  Say Maxine Waters told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper that her first act as president would be to \"impeach Donald Trump.\"    Maxine Waters U.S. House of Representatives, D-Calif. https://www.facebook.com/JudgeJeanineFans/photos/a.110035152675347.1073741828.109955466016649/744041135941409/?type=3&theater   posts on the Internet Tuesday, May 15, 2018 2018-05-15    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02056"}
