As the ad shows images of shuttered factories, Obama talks about the nation\u2019s economic difficulties. Several phrases appear on the screen:\n\n\"In 2008 \u2026 he promised Pennsylvanians hope & change \u2026 Today: Unemployment up 19% \u2026 37,900 Pennsylvania manufacturing jobs lost \u2026 189,000 more Pennsylvanians in poverty \u2026 Failed promises. Change direction.\"\n\nWe\u2019ll take the easy ones first, then take up the complicated one.\n\nUnemployment in Pennsylvania is up 19 percent.\n\nMaking comparisons like these can be a bit confusing, because it\u2019s easy to mix up percentage points and percents. But the number is accurate.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Pennsylvania\u2019s unemployment rate in January 2009 was 6.8 percent, while its rate in October 2011 was 8.1 percent. That\u2019s an increase of 1.3 percentage points, but that can also be expressed as an increase of 19 percent above the initial level.\n\nWe should point out that Pennsylvania unemployment is actually down by seven-tenths of a point from its peak of 8.8 percent between January 2010 to April 2010. Expressed the way the ad did it, that means unemployment has fallen by 8 percent since its peak.\n\nBut we have no quibble with the RNC\u2019s methodology.\n\nThere are 189,000 more Pennsylvanians in poverty.\n\nAccording to the Census Bureau, the number of Pennsylvanians in poverty rose from 1,335,000 in 2008 (the final year before Obama took office) to 1,521,000 in 2010 (the last year for which data is available). That\u2019s a difference of 186,000 -- close enough in our book to the 189,000 cited in the ad.\n\n37,900 Pennsylvania manufacturing jobs were lost.\n\nAccording to state employment statistics compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number is correct. Between January 2009, when Obama took office, and October 2011, the most recent month for which state figures are available, Pennsylvania did indeed lose 37,900 manufacturing jobs.\n\nBut that isn\u2019t the end of the story.\n\nFor starters, it\u2019s PolitiFact\u2019s policy not to focus solely on the accuracy of the numbers in political attacks (or, conversely, efforts to claim political credit) but also to determine whether blame or credit for the results is justified. (This policy applies to all three statistics in this ad.)\n\nFor job-creation and job-loss claims, we have ruled that politicians\u2019 policies are just one factor in employment levels, making even statistically accurate claims something less than True on our Truth-O-Meter.\n\nHowever, the suggestion that manufacturing jobs have declined due to Obama\u2019s policies is even more questionable than most job-related claims we\u2019ve reviewed. As we have noted earlier, the nation\u2019s manufacturing activity has fallen off a cliff over the past 50 years. This stems from countless reasons, ranging from the expansion of free trade to educational attainment patterns to the emergence of new sectors such as information technology.\n\nIn January 1960, manufacturing jobs accounted for 29 percent of U.S. employment. By March 2011, that had fallen by about two-thirds, to just 9 percent. And in Pennsylvania, the number of manufacturing jobs has fallen by 40 percent since January 1990, the oldest data available for the state on the BLS Website.\n\nBased on this context, we think it\u2019s a stretch to blame Obama for the decline in manufacturing jobs in Pennsylvania since January 2009. But the claim is even more problematic if you look at how manufacturing in Pennsylvania fared under Obama's predecessor, George W. Bush.\n\nBetween the time Bush took office in January 2001 and the time he left in January 2009, the number of Pennsylvania manufacturing jobs fell by 244,900. Dividing by Bush\u2019s eight years in the White House, that works out to an annual decline of 30,613 manufacturing jobs.\n\nYet taking the decline under Obama and dividing that by 2.83 years in office works out to 13,376 manufacturing jobs lost per year -- or less than half the rate of decline under Bush.\n\nIn other words, during the worst economic conditions since the Great Depression, Pennsylvania manufacturing job losses declined less than half as quickly under Obama as under Bush. This clashes with the overall message of the ad, which is that Obama economic policies have failed Pennsylvania, and -- judging by the ad\u2019s imagery -- its manufacturing sector in particular.\n\nThis may not offer much solace for the Obama camp -- it\u2019s hard to crow, \"The Pennsylvania manufacturing sector eroded more slowly on our watch than it did under our predecessor!\" -- but we do think it\u2019s important context to point out.\n\nOur rating\n\nThe ad gets all of its numbers right, but it overreaches by holding Obama fully accountable for these trends. In particular, the RNC\u2019s manufacturing jobs statistic ignores both a decades-long national and state decline in manufacturing jobs and the fact that the rate of manufacturing job losses in Pennsylvania during Obama\u2019s presidency was slower than the rate of job losses under his predecessor, George W. Bush. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Godlewski\n\n\nstated on January 9, 2021 in Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all women that lost jobs (in the December jobs report), it was mostly Black and Latina women.
