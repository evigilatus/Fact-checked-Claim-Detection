His one positive note, however, was about the recidivism rate for the Eastern District of Missouri probation office, which includes St. Louis and Cape Girardeau, Missouri.\n\n\n\"It\u2019s nothing I do, but the probation office here in the Eastern District of Missouri is the best in the country,\" he said. \"They have about a 7.5% recidivism rate, compared to national averages of 70 or 80%.\"\n\n\nWe\u2019ve had a\u00a0similar check in Wisconsin, but we haven\u2019t delved into Missouri\u2019s Eastern District. Does it really outperform the rest of the country? Here\u2019s what we found.\n\n\nJensen is making an apples-to-oranges comparison between district and national numbers.\n\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to check whether the Eastern District is the best in the nation because the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics doesn\u2019t study recidivism at state and county levels.\n\n\nAn apples-to-oranges comparison\n\n\nThe numbers are difficult to compare.\n\n\nScott Anders, chief U.S. probation officer for the Eastern District, responded to PolitiFact\u2019s request for the source of Jensen\u2019s statistics.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in remarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe district\u2019s numbers match Jensen\u2019s claim. In 2019, 7.5% of people under supervision \u2014 prisoners on parole, supervised release or probation \u2014 were rearrested, Anders said. Additionally, the rearrest rate from 2012 to 2016 averaged 7.76%, according to the Eastern District\u2019s rearrest reports.\n\n\nIt\u2019s not as easy as Jensen made it seem to compare those rates to national averages. In a\u00a0report that studied recidivism rates\u00a0of state prisoners from 2005 to 2014, the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics broke up the rates into one-year, three-year, six-year and nine-year periods.\n\n\nHere\u2019s what the study found: 44% of state prisoners were arrested within one year after release, 68% were arrested within three years, 79% within six years and 83% within nine years.\n\n\nSo, while the statistics match Jensen\u2019s ballpark estimate of a 70 or 80% national recidivism rate, he is making an apples-to-oranges comparison when weighing them against the Eastern District\u2019s rate.\n\n\nBest in the country?\n\n\n\n\nThe first part of Jensen\u2019s claim \u2014 that the Eastern District is the best in the country \u2014 is more difficult to check.\n\n\nBureau of Justice Statistics spokesperson Tannyr Watkins wrote in an email that the bureau has not studied recidivism rates for individual states or counties. There\u2019s no other governmental group that tracks the rates by district across the country.\n\n\nOur ruling\n\n\nU.S. attorney Jeff Jensen said his district\u2019s probation office is the best in the nation. He noted the office\u2019s recidivism rate \u2014 7.5% \u2014 and compared it to the nation\u2019s rate of 70% or 80%.\n\n\nJensen had both his numbers for the Eastern district\u2019s rate and the national averages straight, but he was making a comparison across different time periods. The Bureau of Justice Statistics also hasn\u2019t studied recidivism rates at a state or county level, so there\u2019s nothing to say it\u2019s the best in the nation.\n\n\nBecause Jensen had the right idea in promoting his district\u2019s recidivism rate, but the numbers don\u2019t exactly line up, we rate this claim\u00a0Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16732"}
