We want you here. We'll protect you here.'\"\n\n\nRomney is referring to a statement Giuliani made at a 1994 news conference: \"If you come here and you work hard and you happen to be in an undocumented status, you're one of the people who we want in this city. You're somebody that we want to protect, and we want you to get out from under what is often a life of being like a fugitive, which is really unfair.\"\n\n\nRomney says that shows Giuliani is too welcoming to illegal immigrants and that his policies made New York a \"sanctuary city.\" We've addressed the sanctuary city debate in\n\nthis item\n\nand\n\nthis article,\n\nso we'll simply focus here on the quote.\n\n\nIndeed, Romney accurately summarized what Giuliani said.
