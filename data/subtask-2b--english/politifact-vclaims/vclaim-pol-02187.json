The reports have yet to be confirmed, but footage of women and children foaming at the mouth threaten to draw a military strike by Western forces.\nThe California-based non-interventionist website Antiwar.com posted an article saying the Syrian Red Crescent, which is a member of the international Red Cross/Red Crescent federation, rejected the idea of a chemical attack.\n\"The Syrian Red Crescent issued a statement Monday dismissing the allegations of a weekend chemical weapon attack in the city of Douma,\" the April 9 article said. \"The statement insisted their medical personnel in the city had found no evidence any such attack took place.\"\nPolitiFact contacted the Syrian Arab Red Crescent (the organization typically includes the Arab designation) to confirm the statement.\n\"We are not aware of such a declaration,\" said Rana Sidani Cassou in the Beirut office of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. \"Neither the Syrian Arab Red Crescent nor the International Federation are in a position to confirm or deny any attack.\"\nIn fact, during the April 7 attack, Syrian jets had targeted the Syrian Red Crescent hospital in Douma and the next day, the group tweeted that the Douma branch had shut down.\nWhen we contacted Eric Garris, director of Antiwar.com, the website retracted the article, and posted a new one with the headline \"Report of Syrian Red Crescent Statement on Alleged Douma Attack Incorrect.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGarris told PolitiFact that they based the original story on an article that appeared April 8 on the Russian-state sponsored news website Tass. That article said the Syrian Red Crescent had issued a statement.\nWe can\u2019t verify that. The Tass article quotes doctors who work with the Syrian Red Crescent talking about an attack that took place in January. Garris said his news editor believes Tass might have changed the article from the version he first saw.\nGarris said his group moved ahead with the story, even though he did not find confirmation on the Syrian Red Crescent website.\n\"I have no excuse for letting it slip through like this,\" Garris said. \"We should have been more diligent. There\u2019s enough misinformation out there, and we don\u2019t want to be a part of that.\"\nThe retraction said, \"In the future, we will not use foreign news sources as the sole source for important articles like this.\"\nOur ruling\nThe Antiwar.com website said that the Syrian Red Crescent had issued a statement saying that they found no evidence of a chemical attack in Douma. The organization\u2019s director said that was based on an article from the Russian news service Tass.\nThe Syrian Arab Red Crescent did not make such a statement. Antiwar.com posted a full retraction of its article and apologized for the mistake.\nWe rate this claim False.\n Share the Facts 2018-04-13 18:46:57 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  \"Red Crescent Says No Evidence of Chemical Attack in Syria\u2019s Douma.\"    Antiwar.com A non-interventionist website https://news.antiwar.com/2018/04/09/red-crescent-says-no-evidence-of-chemical-attack-in-syrias-douma/   In an article on the Antiwar.com website Monday, April 9, 2018 2018-04-09    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02187"}
