Scott Walker was a brag about the national cable television audience that his government budget for 2011-2013 ended the practice of pushing financial problems into the future. In June 2011, he appeared on CBC, and Walker said that his first budget \"pulled\" was a huge deficit and made changes to avoid it in the future. Now, weeks before the 4 November 2014 elections, the Governor is facing questions about his projected budget deficit for the 2015-17 budget, which is partly due to the tax cuts he won. And Walker is arguing about how a projected shortfall of $1.8 billion is a suspect. Walker said during the debate on October 17, 2014, when the Democratic Opposition challenged Mary Burke's $1.8 billion that I heard there. \"This just doesn't happen.\" We approached this exchange when we assessed Walker &apos; s false claim that there was actually a surplus, not a deficit, going towards 2015. We said that it flies in the face of official recognition using an old method used by members of both sides, and the Governor's Budget Office. Now let's examine Walker's basic cash -- that the figure of $1.8 billion is based on zero growth, which is a \"not only\" scenario. It is its basis for turning into a different, more Russian, group of numbers. The non-partisan legislative tax office is the source of the estimated deficit of $1.8 billion. As we have made clear, this is an assessment of the challenge that budget makers will face on the basis of previous decisions that they will have to pay for in the next two years. This figure is informally referred to as \"structural deficit.\" But this figure does not actually reflect a \"deficit\" at the end of a budget year -- it's just a standard or a starting point for what officials have to be held accountable for when making spending and tax decisions. Walker and legislators from both sides have long used the Bureau &apos; s tax methodology. Let's start from where Walker did his claim, saying that the analysis is based on a \"zero growth\" assumption in revenue. In Madison Services, it is well known that the Bureau &apos; s method of taxation in this process is to assume that there is no loss or gain in revenue - and no changes in expenditure. In the real world, of course, government tax revenues rise and fall, and legislators adjust spending according to those revenues. By adhering to this method, UNOPS estimates are consistent, allowing budget makers to easily measure how their work will affect future budgets. During budget discussions, legislators often ask how increases in spending or tax cuts will affect the \"structural deficit\" of the next budget. Now the growth history of Walker's declared problem with a zero-growth approach -- that such a scenario \"just doesn't happen.\" Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" \u2022 January 26, 2012, when we requested support, Walker's campaign referred us to the date of growth of State income. To be sure, we have returned to the 2002-2003 budget period and have studied the growth of State revenues annually, and each budget has been for two years since then. We found that zero growth is happening. They were sometimes even worse than zero, usually because of recession and its impact on government tax revenues. In the past 13 years, three individual financial years have been sunk in a negative territory. In 2002: 0.4 per cent in 2009 - 7.1 per cent in 2014 - 1 per cent. In addition, in 2010 there was no growth, mainly - a slight rise of 0.15 per cent. * Reflects all fiscal years ending in July. The budget for the two-year period (2007-2009), which was reduced by the large recession, declined by $505 million, mostly due to a significant decline in income tax and sales tax payments. The total revenue returned to 2007 levels only four years after that date, and under Walker as Governor, revenue growth was 4 per cent in each of its first two years. However, in 2013-2014, revenue declined by 1 per cent, partly because of tax cuts by Republican legislators. Economic forecasts have not stood as planned. We will not know until mid-2015 whether the two-year budget will end with a decrease in income as did the 2007-2009 budget. \u2219 Growth prospects for 2014-15. However, the future Governor and legislators must legally ensure balance by reducing spending or other means as appropriate. Our assessment says Walker that the projected State budget deficit of $1.8 billion for 2015-17 \"in fact comes from a zero-growth assumption. This just doesn't happen.\" The calculation is based on zero growth, so there is an element of truth in Walker's claim. But his main point was to make the zero-growth assumption seem unrealistic, so he misfired. Recent history, including a year under Walker, shows that negative or stable growth is not uncommon. We're mostly assessing his statement wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07097"}
