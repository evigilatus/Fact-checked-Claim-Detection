Bernie Sanders\u2019 universal health care plan.\n\"Sen. Sanders wants to dismantle Obamacare, dismantle the CHIP program, dismantle Medicare, and dismantle private insurance,\" Clinton said in New Hampshire Jan. 12. \"I don't want to empower Republican governors to take away Medicaid, to take away health insurance for low-income and middle-income working Americans. And I think very much that's what Sen. Sanders' plan would do.\"\nThe Sanders campaign and his supporters swiftly called Clinton\u2019s statements inaccurate, so we decided to look into them ourselves \u2014 in particular, her claim that Sanders\u2019 plan would \"empower\" governors \"to take away health insurance for low-income and middle-income working Americans.\"\nGiven that Sanders\u2019 proposed plan specifically calls health insurance an entitlement for all, we found that this is a mischaracterization at best.\nSanders hasn\u2019t released a health care proposal as a presidential candidate, but his campaign has said a bill he introduced in the Senate in 2013 would serve as the model. Sanders has called the plan \"Medicare for all,\" referring to the the health safety net that covers those over 65.\nClinton has a point that enacting the law would disrupt health insurance as we know it, said Gerald Friedman, an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst who has analyzed similar proposals.\nThe bill, the American Health Security Act of 2013, specifically strips insurance benefits from the Affordable Care Act, the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, Medicare and Medicaid. The bill also bans the sale of private health insurance that duplicates benefits provided by the government program.\nAnd she is also right that states would be the primary administrators of the system. The bill calls it a \"state-based American Health Security Program.\" However, the assertion that it would empower Republican governors to take away individual\u2019s health insurance is misleading.\nSanders\u2019 plan requires states to set up the specifics of their health care system, though they must meet federal standards for various administrative details. For example, states must identify\u00a0a single agency to manage the program. If a state does not set up a system, or if they refuse to meet the federal standards, the federal government will step in and run that state\u2019s program.\nClinton\u2019s comments seem\u00a0to be based on how many Republican governors have reacted to the Affordable Care Act, a.k.a. Obamacare, deciding not to accept an expansion of Medicaid, the government insurance program for low-income individuals.\nThe Sanders\u2019 campaign said the provision that allows the federal government to step in and run state programs would prevent\u00a0governors who oppose the law\u00a0from refusing to provide health coverage for their residents or offering subpar programs.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bill also states that every U.S. resident \"is entitled to benefits for health care services\" and would require auto-enrollment at birth or at the point when someone becomes a legal resident.\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign told us that Chelsea Clinton\u2019s point was that the law would get rid of all of the existing benefits \u2014 Obamacare, Medicaid, Medicare, CHIP, etc. \u2014 for everyone.\nThat may be true, but Sanders\u2019 health care seeks to immediately replace all of these programs, as well as attempt to cover all those currently uninsured. That would be a federal-level change, rather than governors choosing to scrap those federal programs, and Sanders\u2019 bill does make an effort to establish measures to circumvent the states that try to undermine the law.\nIt sounds like Clinton is saying\u00a0that\u00a0millions would be left totally uninsured as a result of Sanders' plan\u00a0giving more authority to governors, which isn't the case.\n\"Her claim is analogous to saying that Medicare dismantled private insurance for the elderly,\" said David Himmelstein, co-founder of Physicians for a National Health Program and an advocate for a national health insurance system. \"It replaced defective private coverage with something better.\"\nHillary Clinton\u2019s campaign also emphasized that at the very least, state governments could administer the program in such a way that they provide low-quality insurance compared to other states, such as by limiting reimbursement rates for providers. The campaign noted that Sanders' bill says the federal government must fund between 81 and 91 percent of each state\u2019s program, so if a state doesn't\u00a0cover the remaining costs, that could affect the services provided.\nOne final note: It\u2019s not at all clear that Sanders\u2019 plan would pay for itself or be practical to implement. (We explored those issues in a separate story.) And his plan would certainly get rid of many existing programs. But Chelsea Clinton attacked the plan for one area that seems pretty clear, and that\u2019s its coverage provisions. The plan\u2019s defining feature is that it offers health insurance coverage to every American.\nOur ruling\nChelsea Clinton said Sanders\u2019 health care plan would \"empower\" governors \"to take away health insurance for low-income and middle-income working Americans.\"\nUnder Sanders\u2019 plan, Americans would lose their current health insurance. However, his proposal would replace their health insurance and cover the currently uninsured. The program would auto-enroll every citizen and legal resident, all of whom would be entitled to benefits. While the plan would give governors authority to administer health insurance within their states, it includes provisions to allow federal authorities to take over if the governors refuse to implement it.\nIt\u2019s impossible to predict with certainty how Sanders\u2019 plan would play out in real life. But Clinton\u2019s statement makes it sound like Sanders\u2019 plan would leave many people uninsured, which is antithetical to the goal of Sanders\u2019 proposal: universal health care.\nWe rate her claim Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05555"}
