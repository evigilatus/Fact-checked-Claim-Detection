Ernest Almonte, an independent candidate for the post of Secretary of the General Fund, was asked during an interview on 5 October 2014 in the second half of the WLNE \"On the Register\" whether the 2011 reform of the Rhode Island government pension system had gone far enough. \"First and foremost,\" Almont said, \"I was talking about pension reform almost 17 years ago, warning elected officials that if you don't care about this problem, it requires harsh measures.\" As a fact, he said, \"It's come to the point that if you're not going to fix this, you have to start, (rather than) sending your birthday cards and your grandkids and Christmas cards, We asked whether Almonte, who served as Auditor General of Rhode Island from 1994 to 2010, was sufficiently aware of the problems with the public pension systems of Rhode Island 17 years ago, and what kinds of reforms he said were necessary. The Almonte campaign sent us several documents from the Office of the Auditor General. Only a few of them had returned since the late 1990s, and the related problems addressed the problems of the payment of pensions in individual communities, not in State employees. One of them was a 1998 letter to the Coventry Cashier stating that some of the city's retirement plans \"have insufficient assets to meet the expected benefits.\" That was 16 years ago. Another version of a 1998 report by the Johnston Financial Review Committee, chaired by Almonte, warned that the city owed $3.2 million in contributions to its employees &apos; pensions. For example, Johnston has not paid firefighters &apos; pension fund for more than three years, placing more than $1.3 million in his payments. We note that the comments of Almonty in both reports are in the dry language of the auditors. Some readers may not consider this a scary warning Almonte said he did. But we also found page 8 of May 1988 on the front page of the Providence Journal, which states how Almont explained to over 200 Johnston residents that their city was in deep financial trouble. \"To drive the house the severity of the situation,\" said the story, \"Almont gave examples that sometimes made the winning audience: credit rating at the bottom of the barrels. Between April 1996 and March 1997, the town &apos; s bank account had been overdrawn for 146 days. The pension contributions required for workers were less than $3.19 million. \"That's not all, Almont said. We still have to calculate unfunded retirement liabilities that have not been quantified, and can add to the untold millions, \"the story I mentioned. We have also referred the Almonte campaign to a report issued in March 1999, which is available on the Auditor General &apos; s website for fiscal year 1997. It notes that \"five school districts, five municipalities and three police and fire units were lagging behind,\" amounting to some $1.7 million in their pension payments. On January 16, 2021, Jordan Rachel stated in Tweedda that the minimum wage of $15 per hour would raise the price of taco bill burrito to $38. \u2022 On 20 January 2021, the State withheld school aid and paid the traffic fine to six municipalities until they paid for it. That was 15 years ago. If Almonte did not warn of an imminent crisis in the government pension system in those days, it was because there was no crisis. According to its 2000 audit of the State Employees &apos; Retirement Scheme, covering the fiscal year ending in 1999, the funding ratios - that is, the amount of money that each plan had reached compared to the amount of money that it was expected to need to cover pension costs - have been increasing steadily for years. For example, the proportion of State employees increased from 73 per cent in 1993 to 81 per cent in 1998. In addition, all plans received the recommended amount of funding since 1996 at least, and in many cases even more. This is gonna change. By 2006, the funded ratio of this plan had fallen to 55 per cent. By 2009, it had risen to only 59 per cent, and the debate on pension costs was about to explode. There were no documents from that period indicating that Almonti was calling for comprehensive changes in the independent pension schemes for State employees and teachers paid by the Treasurer-General Gina Raimundo and approved by the General Assembly and Governor Lincoln Chavi. In an interview with Almonte, he had been talking about the problem of State pensions at the time because the late payments he had referred to had been payments from cities and towns to the State-run municipal employees &apos; retirement system, also known as MERS, which was under the jurisdiction of the State Treasury Secretary. \"Remediation isn't just what you have to do with an employee or employee benefits,\" he said. \"I have been calling for management reform\" to make local communities pay on time, especially when the city or city retains the money that workers reserve to assist in the payment of retirement benefits. \"When payments are late, you miss the profits, and this is the beginning of the problem because the problem doubles itself.\" Governor Ernest Almonte said, \"I was talking about pension reform almost 17 years ago.\" The comment was made in the context of a question on the State pension system. It is clear from the documents provided by Almonte and the information we found that Almonte was warning of problems years ago. However, the documents he was able to provide addressed only problems in municipal plans, although some of those were in the state-run MERS system. Because his statement is precise but needs further clarification or information, we often judge it correctly.
