Carlos Curbelo of Miami. \u00a0\n\"Congressman Curbelo just voted for a disastrous health care repeal bill opposed by the American Medical Association, AARP and the American Cancer Society. Curbelo voted to raise your costs and cut coverage for millions, to let insurance companies deny affordable coverage for cancer treatment and maternity care, and charge five times more for people over 50. Curbelo voted yes even though the bill makes coverage completely unaffordable to people with pre-existing conditions,\" the ad claims.\nThe same ad also attacks U.S. Rep. Brian Mast who represents Florida\u2019s Treasure Coast and members in many other states, including moderates who could face tough re-election campaigns in 2018. The ad is largely digital but in some districts it will appear on TV.\nFormed in 2016, Save My Care is affiliated with\u00a0Eric Kessler, a former White House appointee, helping to manage conservation issues during Bill Clinton\u2019s administration. It operates out of the same office as the New Venture Fund, a 501(c)(3) that launches projects related to global health and other areas.\nThere were a lot of claims to check out from the ad, but we wanted to know whether the bill allows insurance companies to \"charge five times more for people over 50.\"\nOne provision jumped out right away: Insurance companies could charge five times more for those ages 50-64 buying insurance on the individual market.\nSome viewers might assume the five-fold increase starts from zero.\nWhat the ad doesn\u2019t tell you is that insurers can already charge older people more than younger adults \u2014 three times as much.\nAge ain\u2019t nothing but a number (but it could\u00a0make insurance more expensive)\nFor this fact-check, we\u2019re looking at what the proposed House health bill does about older adults between ages 50-64 on the individual health insurance market.\nSo this doesn\u2019t apply to seniors on Medicare, or people between 50 and 64 years old who have employer-sponsored coverage.\nUnder current law, insurance companies can charge older adults up to three times as much as younger people based on their age. This is known as 3-to-1 \"rate banding.\"\nThe House bill increases the ratio up to five times starting in 2018, unless states set a different age ratio.\nBefore the Affordable Care Act, premiums for older adults were typically four or five times\u00a0the premiums charged to younger adults, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.\nThat more accurately reflects the actual higher costs spent for older adults\u2019 health care, said Linda Blumberg, health policy expert at the Urban Institute.\nSo the lower 3-to-1 age ratio in the ACA was a better deal for older adults. The goal was to make coverage more affordable for older adults regardless of their health status.\nIf the House bill with the 5-to-1 rate banding were to become law, older adults would pay more than current law, according to an estimate by the Rand Corporation, which evaluated an earlier version of the American Health Care Act, or AHCA. \u00a0(The research was funded by the Commonwealth Fund, which aims to increase health care access for the poor.)\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin Nunes\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in an interview on Fox\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRepublicans have no way to communicate\u201d after tech companies cut off Parler.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Amy Sherman \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe increased costs would occur, Rand Corporation said, as a result of tax credits in the House bill not increasing with age as steeply as premiums.\nYoung people, however, would get a break on premiums.\nOlder Americans could get hit with other costs, too\nThe change in age ratios is just one of many provisions of the House proposal that could change the costs for older adults.\nThe legislation would replace the current income-based tax credits with a credit based on age.\nFor adults over 60, that would mean a $4,000 credit.\nFor adults under 30, the credit would be $2,000.\nThe legislation phases out tax credits for individuals who make more than $75,000 annually (or a couple who files jointly earning $150,000).\nKaiser created an interactive map to show that the cost impact varies based on several factors.\n\"Generally, people who are older, lower-income or live in high-premium areas (like Alaska and Arizona) receive less financial assistance under the AHCA,\" Kaiser concluded about the House bill.\nA Congressional Budget Office analysis of an earlier version of the legislation (the final legislation did not receive a CBO score) concluded that it would disproportionately increase the number of uninsured ages 50-64 with incomes less than 200 percent of the poverty limit.\nFor an example: Under current law, a 64-year-old with an income of $26,500 would pay a net premium of $1,700 after factoring in a tax credit. Under the House bill, according to CBO, that person\u2019s premium rises to $14,600. (See table 4)\nOlder Americans could see more changes if states choose to redefine essential health benefits for coverage in the individual market.\n\"I cannot imagine a scenario where the AHCA is not worse for older adults than the ACA,\" Blumberg said.\nCurbelo\u2019s spokeswoman told us Curbelo has called for improving the bill that he voted for.\n\"The congressman is continuing to work to ensure that all Americans have access to coverage options they can afford, focusing specifically on making sure we increase the amount of the tax credits for lower income Americans and for those nearing the age of retirement,\" Joanna Rodriguez told PolitiFact.\nOur ruling\nThe Save My Care ad says that Curbelo voted for a health care bill that will let insurance companies \"charge five times more for people over 50.\"\nThe ad refers to a provision that will allow insurance companies to charge adults five times more for insurance than younger people buying on the individual market. But the ad could leave a misleading impression that it\u2019s five times more than the current situation -- and that\u2019s not the case. Under the Affordable Care Act, insurers were allowed to charge this age group three times as much for insurance (which was considered a better deal than the situation before). Also, the increase in the ratio applies to Americans ages 50-64 -- not seniors who are on Medicare.\nWe rate this claim Half True.\n Share the Facts 2017-05-12 13:14:39 UTC   Politifact    3 1 7  Politifact Rating: Half True  U.S. Rep.
