Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., claims private citizens have more assault weapons than members of the military do, how does he know?\n\"There are more assault rifles, as I understand it, in the hands of private citizens than in the hands of the United States military,\" the 2020 presidential candidate said in the wake of the back-to-back mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio. \"We're talking about 5 (million) to 10 million assault weapons in the hands of private citizens.\"\nSanders\u2019 claim suffers a bit from comparing private and military weapons, which are different. Plus, he has to rely on wildly varying estimates, although his seems on the lower end.\u00a0\nWe\u2019ll sort out the facts for you.\u00a0\nAssault-style guns in both attacks\u00a0\nIn both shootings, assault-style weapons, legal in both states, were used. Each weapon was semiautomatic \u2014 the gunmen could fire as quickly as they could pull the trigger \u2014 and carrying enough ammunition to potentially kill dozens of people in minutes.\u00a0\nThe New York Times reported that the El Paso shooter used a semi-automatic Kalashnikov-style rifle (also known as an AK-47-style rifle), which typically uses a magazine that has 30 rounds; and that the Dayton shooter used an AR-15-style pistol, modified to act as a rifle, with a drum magazine that can hold up to 100 rounds.\u00a0\nTerminology problem\nWe\u2019ll note that \"assault weapon\"\u00a0does not have a universal definition. For example, a bill called the Assault Weapons Ban of 2018 defined an assault weapon differently than the federal law that banned assault weapons from 1994 to 2004, before expiring.\u00a0\n\"None of the so-called \u2018assault rifles\u2019 legally owned by U.S. civilians are assault rifles as the term is used in military contexts,\" said Florida State University criminal justice professor emeritus Gary Kleck, who has done research on large-capacity firearms used by mass shooters.\n\"Assault rifles used by members of the military can all fire full automatic, like machine guns, as well as one shot at a time, whereas none of the so-called \u2018assault rifles\u2019 legally owned by U.S. civilians can fire full automatic.\"\nBut Kleck agreed that semiautomatic weapons evolved from earlier military weapons, many look like military weapons, and they can kill people rapidly.\nThe number of private weapons\nSanders campaign policy director Josh Orton acknowledged to us that the precise number of a particular type of weapon in civilian hands is not known, given there is no national gun registration. In fact, federal law prohibits there being a national registry.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Orton argued that Sanders\u2019 figure of 5-10 million of semiautomatic rifles, such as the AR-15, is a conservative estimate.\nHe cited a 2016 CNBC news article that quoted the National Rifle Association as saying there were 5 million AR-15s in circulation; he also cited other data suggesting the figure could be much higher.\u00a0\nHarvard University gun researcher Deborah Azrael told us that her latest survey of gun owners showed there were about 90 million rifles in private hands in the United States in 2015. The survey did not ask about about AR-15s, but 5-10 million is plausible, said she and her colleague on the survey, Matthew Miller of Northeastern University.\nAs recently as June 2019, the NRA called a reported figure of more than 11 million AR-15s \"an arguably lowball figure.\"\u00a0\nGun researchers including Kleck, Miller and Philip Cook of Duke University, cautioned us on relying on estimates made by the NRA or the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the firearms industry\u2019s trade association. Those figures could be inflated with the aim of making assault-style weapons appear common.\u00a0\n\"The fact is, we just don\u2019t know\" the actual number, Miller said.\nAaron Karp, a senior consultant to the Small Arms Survey and a political science lecturer at Old Dominion University in Virginia, told us he believes Sanders\u2019 estimate for private citizens is \"very conservative.\"\u00a0\nKarp estimates there are 15 million to 20 million assault-style weapons in the hands of Americans.\nThe number of military weapons\u00a0\nGun researchers we consulted told us they are not aware of any counts of assault-style weapons held by members of the military.\nSanders\u2019 campaign pointed us to an estimate of 4.5 million from the Small Arms Survey, an independent research project based in Geneva, Switzerland. That is for all U.S. military-owned firearms, not assault-style weapons. But it would be exceeded by the estimated 5 million or more assault-style weapons in private hands.\nOur ruling\nSanders said: \"There are more assault rifles, as I understand it, in the hands of private citizens than in the hands of the United States military. We're talking about 5 (million) to 10 million assault weapons in the hands of private citizens.\"\nThere are no official counts of assault-style weapons, either in private hands or in the U.S. military.\nBut estimates that the civilian figure could be 5 million or more appear to be conservative and would exceed the estimated number of all weapons in the military. At the same time, those are semiautomatic weapons, not fully automatic like those used in the military.\nWe rate Sanders\u2019 statement Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00295"}
