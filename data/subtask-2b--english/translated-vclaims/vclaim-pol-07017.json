The announcement sent news staff jogging for a better understanding of Lynch's political perspectives and a better understanding of the possibility that they might be confirmed by the United States Senate. The Brightbart news site revealed a controversial line in Lynch's autobiography. \"The new Obama candidate for Attorney General Loretta Lynch represented Clintons in Whitewater,\" I read an address from Warner Todd Houston Warner Bart. Houston wrote: There's only one problem. Brittbart got the wrong Loretta Lynch. This error was first noted by liberal journalists working in the media. Britt eventually admitted to correcting that they got Lynch wrong, but left the story anyway.

The other Loretta Lynch obtained a degree in law from Yale University and worked on several political campaigns, including Clinton, according to her curriculum vitae. Loretta Lynch served as Chairman of the California Public Utilities Committee in 2000-2002 and as Commissioner until 2005. We took this picture of her from her last appearance on C-SPAN, when she was talking to senators in 2002 about an alleged scheme by Enron to manipulate California's energy prices. In an article on Brettbart that has since been deleted, Loretta Lynch, Obama's new candidate for Attorney General, said, \"She was a member of Bill Clinton's defense team during the Whitewater corruption investigation in 1992. The conservative news site got the wrong Loretta Lynch. We hope that the correction will spread as quickly as the original story spreads.
