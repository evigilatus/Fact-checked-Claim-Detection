If you cut out the introductory clauses, it gets down to about 15 seconds. Either way, it\u2019s not 10.\n\nAnd Lynch makes five claims, not three. Let's take a look at them, point by point.\n\nKeep in mind that we're fact-checking Gemma's statement. But to do so, we need to check what Lynch said.\n\n1) Gemma has not been \"involved\" in politics. We can't evaluate this one, because it's a subjective comment, not a fact.\n\n2)\u00a0 Gemma was \"not even registered to vote as recently as a few years ago.\"\n\nGemma told us he first registered in Providence many years ago, moving his registration to Cumberland when he relocated there in the 1990s, before moving again, to Lincoln, in 2004.\n\nThe Cumberland Board of Canvassers has a record showing Gemma registered to vote there in 1998. In Lincoln, town records show Gemma has been registered to vote since 2004 and voted in the November 2004, 2006 and 2008 elections.\n\nIt was difficult to verify Gemma's entire registration history, in part because of record-keeping problems at the boards of canvassers and the move from paper to computer records.\n\nBut we verified that Gemma has been registered for at least six years, so Lynch's second claim is false.\n\n3) Gemma \"didn\u2019t bother to vote in the last crucial presidential election.\"\n\nThe Lynch team now says it was referring to Gemma's failure to vote in the March 2008 presidential primary. But the Lincoln Board of Canvassers and the secretary of state's office both confirm that Gemma voted in the November 2008 general election. So Lynch is wrong on that one too. (For the record, we asked Gemma whom he voted for, and he said Barack Obama.)\n\n4)\u00a0 Gemma \"has only been a Democrat for a couple of months.\"\n\nRecords from Lincoln and the secretary of state show that Gemma registered as a Democrat in May 2010 -- the month before he announced his candidacy for Congress. Prior to that, he was registered as unaffiliated since 2004.\n\nWhen we asked Gemma why he accused Lynch of lying about this fact, he insisted he has \"always been a Democrat\" even if his voter registration doesn't indicate so. He can call himself whatever he wants, but his official designation tells a different story. Therefore, Lynch's claim is true.\n\n5)\u00a0 \"Really [Gemma\u2019s] only involvement in the governmental process in Rhode Island has been to support Governor Carcieri.\"\n\nGemma\u2019s campaign finance reports show that in recent years he gave about $3,000 to a small group of candidates. Carcieri received the largest sum: $1,000, almost a third of the total. But Gemma also donated to U.S. Rep. James Langevin, Lt. Gov. Elizabeth Roberts and former Providence Mayor Joseph Paolino, a developer. So Lynch's claim is false.\n\nNow let\u2019s get back to Gemma's original accusation: \"Bill Lynch told three lies in ten seconds.\" As we know there were five statements -- of which we checked four -- and it was at least 15 seconds, not 10.\n\nSo we\u2019re not sure how Gemma did his timing. His explanation: if you take any three of these claims they\u2019ll add up to 10 seconds. That's very creative timekeeping.\n\nBut we understand we're nitpicking. So let\u2019s look at the more substantive part of the claim. Three of the four factual accusations Lynch made were wrong. Whether they were lies or misstatements is for someone other than PolitiFact to decide.\n\nRemember though, we\u2019re ruling on what Gemma said, not Lynch's accuracy.\n\nWhile Lynch\u2019s claims might have warranted a check, Gemma trumped them by putting out a news release that was intended to be provocative. Instead of just pointing out Lynch\u2019s inaccuracies, he called him a liar and he cited a precise time frame. Neither point was completely right and Gemma deserves to be called out on that. But the meat of what Gemma said about his opponent's accusations was correct.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 23, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBiden invested the entire family fortune in Ukraine gas and oil.
