But when compared with federal highway spending, Amtrak\u2019s balance sheet doesn\u2019t look so bad, according to Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ), a major proponent of rail transportation.\n\n\"Last year we spent more than $40 billion on highways. And Lord knows we need that. But that's more than we spent on Amtrak in its entire 40-year history,\" Lautenberg said in an article on nola.com, the online home of the New Orleans Times-Picayune.\n\nCan it be that after 40 years of operation the money spent on Amtrak didn\u2019t even equal one year of federal highway spending? PolitiFact New Jersey found the claim is right on track.\n\nDoug Hecox, a spokesman for the Federal Highway Administration in Washington, DC confirmed that highway spending for Fiscal Year 2010 (Oct. 1, 2009 to Sept. 30, 2010) exceeded $40 billion. Highway spending generally increases a small amount each year for inflation, he said.\n\nBy comparison, Caley Gray, Lautenberg\u2019s communications director, said Congress has spent $37.9 billion on Amtrak from Fiscal Year 1971 to Fiscal Year 2011, according to Amtrak.\n\nThat\u2019s a bit more than Amtrak\u2019s total, but it supports Lautenberg\u2019s statement.\n\n\"In the forty years of Amtrak\u2019s existence, the Federal government has invested a total of $36 billion in the Amtrak system \u2013 a figure that represents both operating and capital funding,\" Amtrak President and CEO Joseph H. Boardman said in Amtrak\u2019s General and Legislative Annual Report to Senate President Joseph Biden Jr. and House Speaker John Boehner. Amtrak\u2019s Comprehensive Business Plan for Fiscal Year 2012 was included with the report dated Feb. 7. \"Between 1971 and 2008, by contrast, the Federal government has invested more than $421 billion in aviation and over a trillion dollars in the nation\u2019s highways.\"\n\nRod Diridon, executive director of the Mineta Transportation Institute in San Jose, Calif., suggested that Lautenberg wasn\u2019t dismissing the need for highway funding, but pointing to other transportation needs for the nation.\n\n\"His statement is accurate and I think his intent is to indicate that \u2013 certainly not to denigrate the highway system, but to note the world is in transition now, to move away to petroleum-based transportation to electrically based transportation.\"\n\nDiridon didn\u2019t suggest people give up their vehicles, but said having an upgraded electric rail system can have many benefits: efficiency in moving people, less reliance on foreign oil and reduced environmental impact.\n\nLautenberg touched on those points as well as increased ridership in a July 5 letter sent to Sens. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) supporting Amtrak\u2019s $2.2 billion funding request for Fiscal Year 2012. Murray is chairman and Collins is a ranking member on the Appropriations Committee for Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies. Lautenberg and 19 other U.S. senators signed the letter.\n\nAmtrak got $1.41 billion in assistance for its nearly $3.9 billion budget, said Clifford Cole, media relations manager for Amtrak Media Relations/Government Affairs in New York.\n\nOur ruling\n\nIn an article about expanding rail routes and access in Louisiana, Lautenberg said Congress spent more than $40 billion on highways last year, more than has been spent on Amtrak in the national rail system\u2019s 40-year history. The Federal Highway Administration confirmed the highway spending figure, as did Amtrak in a letter requesting $2.2 billion in federal assistance for its Fiscal Year 2012 budget.
