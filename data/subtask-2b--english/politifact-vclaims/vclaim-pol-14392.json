Julie Lassa has a $3,000 headache on her hands.\n\nLassa, seeking the 7th District congressional seat being vacated by U.S. Rep. Dave Obey, D-Wausau, is on the defensive about a pay raise for legislators that took effect in January 2009.\n\nHow lawmakers handled that raise is turning up as a campaign issue in several races this fall. Sean Duffy, the Republican candidate for the northwest Wisconsin seat, calls Lassa a \"Madison insider\" and uses the pay issue to support his position.\n\nAn Aug. 25, 2010 Duffy news release noted that some state lawmakers refused their pay raise, given budget constraints, but that Lassa took the annual $2,530 increase -- even as \"the state was hemorrhaging more than 100,000 jobs.\"\n\nIt went on to quote Duffy campaign manager Matt Seaholm: \"Lassa willingly took a hefty pay raise at a time when people throughout her district and the state were losing their jobs.\"\n\nSo, is the charge on the money?\n\nWe asked Duffy campaign spokeswoman Wendy Riemann for evidence to back up the attack on Lassa. She cited a January 13, 2009 editorial in the Stevens Point Journal, printed shortly after the raises took effect.\n\nSaid Riemann: \"All of the legislators got that raise, and many of the legislators said they were going to give it back and she\u2019s on record as saying, \u2018I\u2019m keeping that money.\u2019\"\n\nLet\u2019s look at how legislators are paid:\n\nMembers of the state Assembly and Senate are paid $49,943. They received a $2,530 (5.06 percent) pay raise, which took effect in January of 2009 and lasts for the next two-year legislative term. \u00a0Lawmakers also receive $88 for each day they spend in Madison.\n\nIn the editorial cited by the Duffy campaign, Lassa defended the raise, saying it was only the second increase for legislators in six years, and less than the rate of inflation.\n\nLegislators don\u2019t vote on their salaries; pay is set by a panel in the state Department of Employment Relations and then voted on by a joint committee of the Legislature. The full bodies don\u2019t vote on their salaries. Lassa is not a member of the committee.\n\nIn the latest tally, 31 of 33 state senators are giving back some portion of their raises, using a variety of methods. According to Senate Chief Clerk Robert Marchant, here\u2019s how Lassa is handling her raise:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLassa took the pay raise, starting in January 2009. She received the higher pay for 13 months.\n\n\n\nIn February of 2010, three months before she announced her congressional bid, Lassa notified Marchant she wanted to take lesser pay. By law, legislators can\u2019t simply receive a smaller paycheck; they need to use another mechanism to return money they don\u2019t want. Lassa is using furlough days that extend through June 2011.\n\n\n\nLassa\u2019s pay raise was worth a total of $6,325 from January 2009 through June 2011. By the end of the fiscal year, Lassa will have returned $3,062, or a little less than half of her raise.\n\n\nSo, where does that leave us?\n\nThe Duffy campaign is partially right: Lassa took the pay raise -- for about 13 months. But long before they launched the attack and before she announced her congressional campaign, Lassa had already started to give some back. With her approach, she will give 48.41 percent of her raise back, or about half. That\u2019s where we rate Duffy\u2019s statement as well: Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-14392"}
