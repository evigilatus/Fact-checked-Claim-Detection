A day before Obama\u2019s speech, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway touted Trump\u2019s altruism in an interview with CNN\u2019s Alisyn Camerota:\nConway: \"Donald Trump has been incredibly generous over the course of his life.\"\nCamerota: \"With his own money?\"\nConway: \"With his own money, and his foundation's money \u2014 which is his money.\"\nCamerota: \"No, the foundation's money are other people's.\nConway: \"Okay. He's been incredibly generous. I mean, are we going to actually question -- Hillary Clinton and her husband made almost a quarter of a billion dollars and we're supposed to just question -- and that's okay.\"\nConway made a point to tell Camerota and viewers that the Donald J. Trump foundation\u2019s money comes from Trump. But that\u2019s at odds at reporting we\u2019ve seen, so we wanted to take a deeper look.\nTrump has yet to release his tax returns or provide evidence of his charitable giving, so it\u2019s impossible to know how much he\u2019s directly donated. The Washington Post\u2019s David Fahrenthold has been trying to track down Trump\u2019s donations for months with little success.\nFahrenthold has determined, however, how much money Trump has donated to his foundation by reviewing the foundation\u2019s IRS documents. Based on his reporting, Conway\u2019s claim is inaccurate.\n\"Donald J. Trump Foundation is Trump\u2019s money, his campaign manager says. No,\" Fahrenthold wrote\u00a0in a\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0article.\nWe reviewed the Trump Foundation Form 990s ourselves and verified Fahrenthold\u2019s conclusion.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom 1987, when Trump created the foundation to donate some of his Art of the Deal proceeds, to 2006, Trump was its main contributor. In those three decades, his gifts averaged about $250,000, with the largest one reaching $1 million in 1989.\nIn 2007, Trump gave $35,000, which accounted for about 0.9 percent of the total donations received that year (World Wrestling Entertainment alone gave $4 million). In 2008, he gave $30,000. And then he stopped giving altogether.\nHere are two charts showing how Trump\u2019s donations to his foundation compare to others\u2019 gifts:\n\nWhat about the possibility that the money the foundation currently has still belongs to Trump? Fahrenthold told us that doesn\u2019t add up.\n\"Trump Foundation began 2007 with just $4,238 in the bank. That wasn\u2019t all Trump\u2019s money, but for the sake of argument let\u2019s assume it was. Since then, the available tax records show Trump has given just $65,000, and nothing since 2008. Other donors have given $8.9 million in that time, covering 2007 to 2014,\" he said.\nBy 1995, a year after the foundation received its first non-Trump donation, the Republican nominee\u2019s own money actually stopped being enough to cover his foundation\u2019s charitable giving. And by 2014, the Trump Foundation had given a total of $13.5 million dollars while Trump himself had given it a total of $5.4 million.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that Trump gave more of his own money to the foundation in 2015 and 2016, but the tax forms for those years are not yet available. Fahrenthold told us he\u2019s asked the Trump campaign for clarification but hasn\u2019t received a response. We asked as well and haven\u2019t heard back.\nThe ruling\nConway said the Donald J.Trump Foundation's money \"is his money.\"\nThat may have been accurate several years ago, but no longer. Tax records show Trump hasn\u2019t given to the foundation since 2008.\nWe rate Conway\u2019s claim False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/e0381608-a288-4546-ae4a-14d929bc262d", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04326"}
