Scott Walker\u2019s collective bargaining law.\n\n(On March 24, 2011, the state appeals court panel asked the state Supreme Court to take the case. Prosser has indicated he will not recuse himself.)\n\nSo, let\u2019s evaluate Kloppenburg\u2019s claim.\n\nSince the campaign has only begun to take on a high profile as the April 5 election approaches, let\u2019s first lay some foundation.\n\nProsser, 68, was appointed to the Supreme Court in 1998 and was re-elected three years later to a full 10-term term. He previously spent 18 years in the state Assembly representing the Appleton area; for eight of those years he was the Republican leader.\n\nKloppenburg, 57, of Madison, has been an assistant state attorney general since 1989, working both as a prosecutor and a litigator. This is her first run for public office.\n\nKloppenburg has made contributions to Democratic candidates, but not Republicans, according to the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign database. Groups that have endorsed her most recently include the Sierra Club, the Madison police union and a union that represents public employees in Milwaukee County.\n\nSince 2008, Prosser has been part of a 4-3 conservative majority that controls the Supreme Court. A win by Kloppenburg, who is backed by many people upset with Walker\u2019s collective bargaining law, would create a 4-3 liberal majority.\n\nWe asked Kloppenburg campaign spokeswoman Melissa Mulliken for evidence that Prosser has prejudged matters that are likely to be brought to the high court -- more specifically, which matters. Mulliken said there were none. Kloppenburg\u2019s allegation against Prosser, she said, was made as a broader statement.\n\nAccusing Prosser of prejudging matters, but providing no examples \u2026 well, that takes a lot of the steam out Kloppenburg\u2019s claim.\n\nHer campaign did cite four statements -- three by Prosser\u2019s campaign spokesman, Brian Nemoir, and one by Prosser himself -- as evidence to back up the accusation. We treat a statement from a spokesman as having been made by the candidate himself.\n\nSo let\u2019s examine what Kloppenburg cited.\n\n\"Complement\"\n\nIn a Dec. 8, 2010, news release announcing Nemoir as Prosser\u2019s campaign spokesman, Nemoir said Prosser would be a \"common-sense complement to both the new administration and Legislature.\"\n\nThe reference was to Walker, who had been elected governor but not yet taken office, and Republicans who would control the Senate and Assembly in January.\n\nProsser disavowed the statement weeks later, saying he had not seen it before it went out.\n\nBut the statement left a clear impression that, rather than being part of an independent judiciary, Prosser saw himself as in league with Republicans who controlled the executive and legislative branches of government.\n\n\"Closely mirrors\"\n\nAfter Kloppenburg blasted the \"complement\" comment, Nemoir responded with an e-mail the next day describing Prosser as an independent, \"rule-of-law judge.\"\n\nIn the same statement, however, Nemoir said Prosser\u2019s \"personal ideology more closely mirrors that of the incoming administration and Legislature.\"\n\nThe Kloppenburg campaign cited that as evidence of prejudging.\n\nBut Kloppenburg ignored the rest of Nemoir\u2019s quote, which was that Prosser\u2019s \"impartial approach to applying the law won't deviate\" -- in other words, that he would not prejudge cases.\n\n\"Conservative majority\"\n\nNemoir said Feb. 9, 2011, that the Prosser-Kloppenburg race \"is about a 4-3 common-sense conservative majority vs. a 3-4 liberal majority, and nothing more.\"\n\nThis statement essentially reiterates that Prosser is a conservative who could hold a swing vote on the Supreme Court. It doesn\u2019t support Kloppenburg\u2019s claim that Prosser has shown he would prejudge cases.\n\n\"Political conservative\"\n\nKloppenburg\u2019s campaign cited instances in which Prosser also described himself as a political conservative, and claimed that indicates prejudging.\n\nAt a March 22, 2011, debate, Prosser acknowledged being a political conservative. But he said that since becoming a justice, he has \"tried very hard to withdraw from the political process, move to the center of the political spectrum, and view each case impartially on the facts of the law.\"\n\nAs with the earlier comments, Prosser calling himself a political conservative is not evidence that he would ignore facts and the law in how he votes on the Supreme Court.\n\nTime for a verdict.\n\nThe statements cited by Kloppenburg indicate Prosser is politically conservative, has views similar to Walker and GOP leaders in the Legislature, and that his re-election would maintain a conservative majority on the Supreme Court. The fact that Prosser disavowed one statement, about his being a \"complement\" to Walker and other GOP leaders, indicates he had concern about signaling how he might rule on cases.\n\u00a0\nBut Kloppenburg didn\u2019t accuse Prosser of giving signals. She said he had \"prejudged matters that are likely to come before the court.\" Yet she could provide no examples.\n\nWe rate Kloppenburg\u2019s claim Barely True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin LeMahieu\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a TV interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It takes quite a while on Election Day to load those ballots, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEditor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.
