We can do better than that, particularly in Latin America. The opportunities for us in Latin America, we have just not taken advantage (of them) of fully. As a matter of fact, Latin America\u2019s economy is almost as big as the economy of China. We\u2019re all focused on China. Latin America is a huge opportunity for us \u2014 time zone, language opportunities.\"\n\nWe won\u2019t judge whether Latin America is a \"huge opportunity\" for the U.S., but we were curious whether it\u2019s true that \"Latin America\u2019s economy is almost as big as the economy of China.\"\n\nWe turned to data on gross domestic product collected by the International Monetary Fund. For Latin America, we combined the GDP for 20 nations: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela. For China, we added up the GDP for China and, using World Bank data, its two \u00a0\"special administrative regions,\" Hong Kong and Macau.\n\nIn 2011, the 20 Latin American nations had a combined nominal GDP of $5.6 trillion, while China, Hong Kong and Macau had a combined GDP of $7.6 trillion. So, China\u2019s GDP was about one-third larger than Latin America\u2019s, meaning the two are hardly neck and neck.\n\nEric Farnsworth, vice president of the Council of the Americas and an aide in the White House Office of the Special Envoy for the Americas under President Bill Clinton, said you can\u2019t close the gap between Latin America and China without broadening the definition to \"the Americas\" by adding Canada, something we don\u2019t think was suggested by Romney\u2019s claim. But even then, the combination of Latin America and Canada still wouldn't get you to the GDP level of China.\n\nIn addition, the growth in China's economy has been outpacing Latin America's, putting Latin America even further behind as time goes on. Between 2010 and 2011, Latin America\u2019s GDP expanded by 14 percent -- an impressive growth rate -- but China\u2019s grew by an even more impressive 23 percent. \"China growth has been extraordinary; Latin America\u2019s has not,\" said Barry Bosworth, an international economics scholar at the Brookings Institution.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.
