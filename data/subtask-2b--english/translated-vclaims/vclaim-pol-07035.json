Trammel and Pratt are for the seventh county seat of Congress, previously occupied by Eric Cantor. The liberal James Carr is in the race too. As the elections approach, we thought that the Trammel statement was worth reviewing. When we asked for evidence that Pratt made the statement, Liz Flowers, a spokesman for Tramel, referred to a video in May of Pratt talking about the Tea Mechanicsville Party. Pratt said that social security and other programmes needed substantial cuts: \"and not just minor marginal changes, right, in order to avoid such insolvency cases with medical care and social security, you would have to make some large cuts,\" he said Pratt for crowds. And that's what politicians don't want to say, right? We have to take some bad medicine coming up. So we have to at least balance the budget.\" Pratt went to say that people would have to work longer before receiving benefits from major federal benefit programs. \"And then you have to raise the working age, right? Social security and medical care were not intended to be retirement programmes. It was intended to be disaster prevention for older persons, and I am all of that. Yeah? But in the worst case scenario. It wasn't 65 years old, getting a pension - the average age of death at that time was 65 years, so it was broken even. The average age of death is now 80. Yeah? So can you pay everyone in the country a huge piece of money for an extra 15 years? No. That's why he's insolvent. This is the beginning.\" We also found a video of Pratt answering questions after a speech at the Church of Life in Mecanexville in April. A man from the public noted that the Social Security Disability Trust was expected to run out in 2016 if Congress did not take steps to strengthen it, and asked Bright for his response in case of reduced benefits. Pratt: My general answer is to do what's fair. Yeah? And so, you draw a graph or a graph and you go to the American people and you go to the stage and you say, \"That's what you put it, on average. That's what you get on average. At present, older people get about $3 for every dollar they put in. So, in general, I think you should go to the American people and be honest with them and say, \"Here's how justice looks.\" So maybe in the next 10 years, we have to find some people in, but basically we're on our way to moving in a direct line to justice and we have to live within our means. Question: Justice in this sense is defined as getting what's coming and not more? Pratt: Right. That's what I'm aiming for. Check the facts (Kirk Cox) was mentioned on January 13, 2021 in a speech. Virginia ranked lowest third of the states in the management of the COVID-19 vaccine. \u2022 On January 20, 2012, the interviewer observed that this would result in reductions in benefits in his disability programme. Pratt: Right, and I don't want that to affect people without advertising it. But this is the downside -- it's not my fault we're there, is it? The holy Scriptures are the questions that teach us. So this is what you're gonna do when Congress is about to hit a brick wall, what are you gonna do? I mean, he hit the brakes or something. With regard to the basic point of Pratt, the 2014 Social Security Secretaries &apos; Report states that the retirement portion of the programme is now used more than just the defined tax income and will run out of reserves to recover and pay the full benefit in 2033. The flowers, the spokesman for Tramel, said that Pratt's attitude had changed over time when he conducted his message for the general election. But he certainly showed support for Grandpa in April's talk and repeated it in an interview in June with The Richmond Times Despatch. \"We must keep our promise to the elderly who are about to retire or are already receiving benefits,\" Bright told the editorial board Times-Dispatch. \"Pirgens who have entrusted their hard-won funds to the Trust Fund for Social Security must receive the benefits to which they are entitled. For younger Virginians, the reform of benefits is crucial in order to ensure the adequacy of medical care and social security.\" In a recent article, Pratt said that he was in favour of raising the retirement age by five years. Tramel said he'd be ready to raise it for two years. Here's what Gotchaine told us about Pratt's support: the grandfather's clause for those aged 10 years or under from retirement; a gradual increase in the age of eligibility to receive benefits for those over 10 years of retirement; a focus on stopping and punishing fraud; and a comprehensive reduction in federal spending. \"When Dr. Pratt talks about justice, he talks about being fair to present and future generations,\" said Gottstein in the e-mail. \"Grandfather is one of the ways that can be fair to both older and retired people. But he also talks about how current workers who contribute to the system are treated fairly by ensuring that the money they invest exists for their retirement.\" The governor, Trammel, says that Bright said, \"The best way to fix social security is to give the elderly back what they paid and nothing more.\" Trails are trying a typical terror tactic - attacking a Republican as he threatens to reduce the benefits of older persons. However, his campaign did not provide examples of Pratt &apos; s actual claim, and Pratt &apos; s support for the idea of the grandmother of the elderly today -- and those who retire within 10 years -- would protect them. ......................................................................................................................... But trayles went beyond the limits of their interpretation and put words in Pratt's mouth. We value Trail's statement as mostly false.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07035"}
