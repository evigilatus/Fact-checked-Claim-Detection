Robert Menendez says Obamacare\u2019s employer mandate affects 1% of U.S. workforce", "text": "Just how many workers does the health care law\u2019s employer mandate affect, anyway?\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s holiday-week announcement that it would delay requiring large employers to provide full-time employees with affordable coverage inflamed opponents of the law. (And dismayed some supporters, who questioned whether the president had that authority.)\n\nBut some pointed out that, in any case, the mandate wouldn\u2019t affect many folks.\n\nTake Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press on July 7:\n\n\"96 percent of all companies in America weren't subject to the mandate because they're under 50 employees. Those who are subject to the mandate, 95 percent of them already offer insurance so, we're talking about probably 1 percent of the American workforce that works for a company subject to the mandate that didn't get insurance and will be able to get it in the health exchanges that open up in October.\"\n\nAre we talking about just 1 percent of the American workforce?\n\nEmployers, employees\n\nWe asked Menendez\u2019s office for evidence for his claim.\n\nA spokeswoman pointed us to a respected employer survey and two opinion pieces.\n\nIt turns out that \"1 percent of the American workforce\" is a ballpark calculation based on survey research on the number of employees who work for large firms that don\u2019t offer insurance.\n\nSeveral prominent health economists we spoke with think that\u2019s a pretty reasonable way to estimate it. But some others think it may understate the reach of the mandate by millions.\n\nBut no one\u2019s sure just how many million. Let us explain.\n\nHere\u2019s how the mandate works: Starting in 2014 \u2014 now 2015 \u2014 employers with more than 50 full-time equivalent employees must offer affordable health coverage. If they don\u2019t offer coverage, or offer coverage that\u2019s too limited or too expensive, they\u2019ll likely end up on the hook for penalties (the government\u2019s calling them \"shared responsibility payments\") of about $2,000 per full-time employee, excluding the first 30.\n\nFor the visual learners among you, the independent nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation summarized the mandate in this nifty infographic.\n\nThe employer mandate\u2019s supposed to work hand-in-hand with the individual mandate that everybody \u2014 with a few exceptions \u2014 carry health insurance or pay a tax penalty. If employers don\u2019t offer coverage, their workers may seek it out on new insurance exchanges, where they may be eligible for tax credits.\n\nThe employer penalties are designed to discourage dumping employees onto the exchanges, where they may drive up the cost of government subsidies. Or, barring that, to offset the cost of those subsidies. (The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated in May, before the delay, that the penalties would be worth $10 billion in 2015.)\n\nBut Menendez argued on Meet the Press that because the mandate applies only to larger companies, most of whom already offer insurance, the number of workers who would have been affected just isn\u2019t all that big. More specifically: about 1 percent of the American workforce.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about that calculation for a second.\n\nThe size of the U.S. labor force, according to the government, is about 156 million.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMenendez\u2019s sources estimated the mandate only affects about 1 million or 1.5 million workers \u2014 about 1 percent of 156 million.\n\nThey focused only on the likely number of employees who work for the 5 percent of large firms that don\u2019t offer insurance, based on a widely respected employer survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nWe know because we talked to them: Zeke Emanuel, a bioethicist, and Mark Duggan, a health economist, both scholars at the University of Pennsylvania who have advised the Obama administration. (Emanuel also happens to be the brother of Rahm, the president\u2019s former chief of staff, now mayor of Chicago.)\n\nIt\u2019s hard to estimate exactly, Duggan said, but if the perhaps 10,000 to 12,000 companies that don\u2019t offer insurance each have about 80 to 100 employees \u2014 there you go. It\u2019s in the range of Menendez\u2019s 1 percent.\n\nIt\u2019s reasonable to assume that most of the companies with more than 50 employees that don\u2019t offer insurance are on the small side, they say, because the Kaiser research shows the larger the size of the firm, the more likely it is to offer insurance.\n\nKaiser itself concludes that in 2012, 95 percent of employers with at least 50 workers offered insurance \u2014 and among firms of that size, 98 percent of employees worked for a company that offered coverage to at least some of its workers.\n\nHere\u2019s the criticism: What about the uninsured workers who work for companies that offer insurance?\n\nDuggan and Emanuel (and others, including Romneycare/Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber at MIT) say most of those folks wouldn\u2019t trigger the mandate, anyway: They\u2019re part-time or temporary workers that companies won\u2019t be required to insure.\n\nOther health economists we spoke with said: Not so fast. How do you know?\n\nChristopher Conover, who works for the Center for Health Policy and Inequalities Research at Duke University, argues there are millions of uninsured workers who work for companies that offer insurance who may well qualify for employer coverage under Obamacare.\n\nHe pointed to a recent example in the New York Times of a restaurant that would likely be subject to the employer mandate. The owner offers health coverage to employees, but only to nine of them. It\u2019s a company, then, that offers insurance \u2014 and so wouldn\u2019t be part of Duggan\u2019s ballpark calculation.\n\nBut under the employer mandate, the restaurant owner estimates he would need to insure 22 of his 85 employees. Conover argues any estimate of the number of workers affected by the mandate should include workers like the 13 restaurant employees who are right now left out.\n\nThey work for a company that offers health insurance, but not to them.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: Economists disagree about how common that situation really is. Are there a million such workers? Five million? More?\n\nThey don\u2019t know.\n\n\"It\u2019s a lot more than a million people. It just has to be,\" said Stephen Parente, a health economist at the University of Minnesota who advised Sen. John McCain\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign.\n\nStill, experts we talked to agreed that the vast majority of the American workforce are not affected.\n\n\"I think the bottom line is that it is small,\" said Gruber of MIT. \"Menendez may not be exactly right but he is in the right ballpark.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nMenendez said on Meet the Press that \"we're talking about probably 1 percent of the American workforce that works for a company subject to the mandate that didn't get insurance.\" He cited a ballpark estimate by health economists based on the small number of large employers who don\u2019t offer insurance.\n\nCritics of the estimate say that calculation misses uninsured workers for the 95 percent of large employers that do offer insurance. The problem is that no one\u2019s sure how many of those workers would be subject to the mandate \u2014 as opposed to part-time or temporary workers who don\u2019t qualify for employer insurance now, and wouldn\u2019t in 2015, either.\n\nBut that number, even if it's millions more, remains a small percentage of the U.S. workforce.
