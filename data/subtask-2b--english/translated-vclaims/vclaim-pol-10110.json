So when we get the wrong words, it stings. In the presidential debate that took place on Monday, Mitt Romney and Barack Obama entered into a debate about whether Romney had shot Russia. \"Political threat\" But we checked something different, whether Romney said Russia wasn't in America. One \"political enemy\" We mischaracterized the Chairman's remarks, which affected our judgment. We have completed the item by exact quote and have changed our decision accordingly. In the recent debate on the presidential campaign, President Barack Obama tried to portray the competitor Mitt Romney as a novice who lacked understanding of complex global issues. \"Goff. Romney, I'm glad you realize that Al-Qaida is a threat, because a few months ago when asked what is the greatest geopolitical threat to America, you said Russia, not Al-Qaida. I said Russia... in the 1980s, they're calling now to ask for their foreign policy back because, you know, the Cold War ended 20 years ago, \"Obama said. We have heard the President accuse Russia before, using similar words. Here's what we found. In March 2012, at a South Korean summit, Obama took place in the \"hot microphone\" incident. Without Obama knowing that he could hear his voice, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev told him that he would have greater capacity to negotiate with the Russians about missile defence after the November elections. \"On all these issues, but in particular missile defence, this can be resolved, but it's important for him to give me space,\" Obama heard Medvedev say, referring apparently to the next Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"Yes, I understand,\" answered Medvedev. Obama intervened: \"This is my last election. After my election, I have more flexibility.\" The exchange attracted rapid reprimands from Republicans, who accused Obama of finding an important security issue. Romney quickly joined the choir of critics. In an interview on 26 March with Wolfe Blitzer on CNN, he said that the President seemed willing to negotiate with the Russians about things he was hiding from the American people. Romney said: \"This is definitely not ours. One geopolitical enemy. They're fighting for every cause for the worst actors in the world. The idea that he has more flexibility in thinking about Russia is actually very, very disturbing.\" Blitzer asked Romney if he thought Russia was a bigger enemy than Iran, China or North Korea. \"I say in terms of a geopolitical opponent, a nation that aligns with the worst actors in the world,\" said Romney. \"The greatest threat facing the world is, of course, nuclear Iran, and North Korea nuclear is already disturbing enough. But when these terrible actors follow their course in the world and go to the United Nations in search of ways to stop them... who is always standing with the worst actors in the world? It's always Russia, usually with China side by side. Thus, in terms of the geopolitical enemy, the State in the Security Council that has the weight of the Security Council, and of course a huge nuclear power, Russia is the geopolitical enemy.\" The opinion article Romney followed that interview a day later by writing an article in Foreign Policy magazine. In that piece, the word \"enemy\" or \"vo\" was not used to describe Russia. But he photographed him as a opponent and referred to his \"aggression.\" \"Without meaningful concessions from Russia, Obama has abandoned our missile defence positions in Poland. He has given Russia new borders on our nuclear arsenal. He has surrendered to Russia's claim that the United Nations resolution on Iran's nuclear weapons programme excludes obstructionist sanctions, \"The books of Romney.\" \"Moscow rewarded these gifts only by obstructing at the United Nations a whole range of issues. It continued to arm the evil Syrian dictator regime and hindered multilateral efforts to stop the ongoing massacre there. Through the painting, it was a thorn on our side about vital questions for America's national security. For three years, President Obama's total policy towards Russia: \"We give, Russia gets.\" In the second interview, Romney spoke again to CNN in Plitzer in July. The Romney campaign referred to this exchange: Blitzer: \"The last time you and I spoke in an interview, you told me that Russia was \"no\" in America. One geostrategic enemy. Do you still believe that?\" Romney: \"There is no doubt, but in terms of political geography -- I'm talking about voices in the United Nations and actions of a geopolitical nature -- Russia is not. One discount in this regard. That doesn't make them enemies. He doesn't make them fighters. They don't represent no. One threat to national security The no. There is one threat to national security, of course, for our nation, Iran nuclear. The clock is still ticking. It continues to move towards nuclearization. This is more and more disturbing and dangerous for the world. But Russia -- especially looking at a place like Syria. Russia has supported the Assad regime even as it attacks its people. Similarly, Russia has been slow to move on to the types of sanctions that have been requested in Iran. Russia is a geopolitical opponent, but it is not an enemy, you know, to fire rockets at each other or things of that kind.\" So in this interview, as he would have done later in the debate, Romney confirmed the difference between Russia, his number. An enemy or an enemy of the United States and Iran, his number. One threat because of its efforts to build nuclear weapons. Romney responded to the debate a few minutes later, giving Romney the opportunity to respond to Obama's accusation about Russia: \"I will respond to a few things I have mentioned. First and foremost, Russia, to which I referred, is a geopolitical enemy. Not... Excuse me. He is a geopolitical enemy, and I said in the same paragraph that I said, and Iran is the greatest threat to national security we face. Russia continues to fight at the United Nations over and over again. I have clear eyes on this. I'm not wearing pink glasses when it comes to Russia or Mr. Putin. And I certainly won't tell him, I'll give you more flexibility after the election. So Romney revised his remarks this time when he called Russia a geopolitical enemy when he told CNN \"no.\" One geopolitical enemy.\" But he is right that in the same interview he called Iran the greatest threat to national security. In our debate, Obama Romney said he called Russia \"the greatest geopolitical threat to America.\" In fact, Romney made a double distinction between his fears about Iran and Russia. Russia was described as the largest geopolitical enemy or enemy of the United States, but he said that the greatest threat was Iran. We're evaluating Obama's half-right statement.
