As a veteran prosecutor who has spent her entire career upholding the laws of this state, I have the training and experience necessary to successfully defend our laws in a courtroom.\"\n\nChecking back on newspaper reports of earlier candidate forums and events featuring Bondi, it\u2019s worth noting that earlier in her campaign, she was vague in outright declaring a position.\n\nDuring a June 4\u00a0forum in St. Petersburg, when asked about upholding McCollum\u2019s challenge, both Benson and Kottkamp said they would. Bondi said, \"Our judiciary will make a fair and just decision regarding that case.\"\n\nEarlier, at a May 18 appearance in Miami Lakes, Bondi was quoted by the St. Petersburg Times as mentioning two gay friends and noting that the adoption process needed reform. \"I have friends in Tampa who are in law enforcement who have adopted from overseas, who are in a loving, committed same-sex relationship.\" Still, calling for an overhaul of the adoption process and clearly specifying whether or not gays should be entitled to adoption are two different things.\n\nBondi, a legal analyst for Fox News, began to clarify her support for the gay adoption ban in subsequent forums and newspaper interviews.\n\nWhen asked by the St. Petersburg Times/Miami Herald in a June 5 interview whether she would follow through on McCollum\u2019s appeal, she responded: \"I will continue with General McCollum\u2019s appeal. If [the Supreme Court] can legally hear it, yes, I will appeal.\"\n\nAt an Aug. 7 forum sponsored by the Christian Family Coalition, Bondi pledged to oppose gay adoption.\n\nBondi campaign spokesman Kim Kirtley also pointed to interviews with the editorial boards of the St. Petersburg Times on July 14 and the Sun-Sentinel on Aug. 10 where she was asked about her position on gay adoption and she stated her support for the ban. Both papers have handed Bondi an endorsement.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBill McCollum\n\n\nstated on July 15, 2010 in a campaign mail piece.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Rick Scott's company is partners with Playboy in a social networking website that has community pages specifically geared towards gay dating.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Aaron Sharockman \u2022 July 19, 2010\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo back to the question. Did Bondi \"refuse to take a position on banning gay adoptions\"? No. She hedged at first, but she\u2019s made it clear\u00a0since then that she will pursue the appeal and opposes gay adoption.
