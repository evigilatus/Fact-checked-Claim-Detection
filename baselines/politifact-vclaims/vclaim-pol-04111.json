Ron Johnson took aim at challenger Russ Feingold in a campaign ad on the Second Amendment. In it, Johnson claimed he will protect the rights of gun owners, but Feingold won\u2019t.\n\"Your right to keep and bear arms, your ability to protect your family is at risk,\" Johnson said in the ad, which was posted online in August 2016. \"Sen. Feingold promises to protect those rights, but that's not what his record shows.\"\nJohnson, a first-term Republican from Oshkosh, is mired in a tight re-election race with Feingold, a Democrat whom Johnson ousted in 2010.\nWhile carrying a shotgun in one hand and ammo in the other, Johnson in the ad references the vacant U.S. Supreme Court seat (\"One more liberal justice will flip the court\") and says he has \"held firm defending the Second Amendment and will continue to do so.\"\nNot so with Feingold, Johnson claims: \"During his 18-year Senate career, (Feingold) supported judges who voted to deny your individual Second Amendment right, and he\u2019d do it again if elected to a fourth term.\"\nThat last sentence is key because it contains a specific factual assertion that Johnson uses to conclude Feingold would not protect the rights of gun owners \u2014 namely that Feingold \"supported judges who voted to deny your individual Second Amendment right.\"\nJohnson also says that while Feingold \"promises to protect those rights,\" his voting record shows the opposite.\nBut do the facts really support Johnson\u2019s conclusion?\nLet\u2019s take a look.\nConfirmation votes and court rulings\nWhen asked for backup, a Johnson campaign spokesman cited Feingold\u2019s votes in the Senate to confirm the appointment of three U.S. Supreme Court justices \u2014 Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor \u2014 who dissented in major gun rights cases.\nIn the 2008 case District of Columbia v. Heller, the Supreme Court held that the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution gives people an individual right to carry a gun for protection and is not merely a collective right tied to participation in a militia.\nBreyer and Ginsburg dissented, with Breyer writing he did not think the Second Amendment protects an absolute right to own a gun, but instead \"protects militia-related, not self-defense-related, interests.\" (Sotomayor was not yet on the court.)\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin LeMahieu\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a TV interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It takes quite a while on Election Day to load those ballots, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo years later in McDonald v. City of Chicago, the Supreme Court effectively extended Heller. The court ruled that the Second Amendment, through the 14th Amendment, applies to states just as it does to the federal government. Breyer and Ginsburg dissented here too, as did Sotomayor.\n(Feingold opposed the appointment of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, who cast a majority vote in support of both Heller and McDonald. The remaining Supreme Court justices who participated in those cases were appointed before Feingold became a senator in 1993, except for John Roberts, who is discussed below.)\nThus, there is some truth to Johnson\u2019s claim insofar as Feingold voted to appoint three justices who, after being confirmed, disagreed that the Second Amendment gives people an individual right to possess a gun.\nBut here\u2019s what Johnson left out of the ad: Feingold also voted to confirm judges whose decisions have strengthened gun rights.\nFor example:\n\u2022 Feingold voted to confirm Chief Justice Roberts, who voted in the majority of both Heller and McDonald.\n\u2022 Feingold voted to confirm Wisconsin native Diane Sykes as a judge to the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. In the 2011 case Ezell v. Chicago, Sykes authored a court decision that invalidated a city of Chicago ban on gun ranges within city limits.\n\u2022 Feingold voted to confirm 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Thomas Hardiman, who in 2013 said the Second Amendment should protect an individual\u2019s right to possess a handgun outside the home.\n\u2022 Feingold voted in 2003 to confirm 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Carlos Bea, who earlier this year joined a ruling that found a California county\u2019s ordinance prohibiting gun stores from within 500 feet of residential areas violated the Second Amendment.\nAnd while Feingold has said he favors mandating background checks on people buying firearms at gun shows, he also has said he was pleased with the outcome in Heller and he has explicitly expressed support for an individual\u2019s right to own a gun.\n\"I\u2019ve long believed that the Second Amendment grants citizens a right to own firearms,\" Feingold said in 2010.\nOur rating\nIn a campaign ad, Johnson said Feingold \"supported judges who voted to deny your individual Second Amendment right.\"\nFeingold did vote to appoint judges who, after being confirmed, disagreed that the Second Amendment provides for an individual right to possess a gun. But Johnson failed to mention in the ad that Feingold also voted to appoint judges who have issued rulings strengthening gun rights. And Feingold has stated clearly he supports an individual\u2019s right to own a gun.\nBecause Johnson\u2019s statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6fe8400a-b450-425e-b3ee-c3b0daabd2b4", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04111"}
