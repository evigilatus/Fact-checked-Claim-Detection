The two official languages of Kenya are English and Swahili. Neither of those languages are exclusive to one country, as Swahili is also spoken in a number of different African nations.\nA search of multiple Swahili dictionaries turned up no results for the word \"Denali.\"\nAs our fact-checker friends at Snopes found, the Swahili word for \"black\" is \"mweusi,\" and the Swahili word for power is \"nguvu.\"\nThat doesn\u2019t amount to \"Denali,\" which has roots in the word \"Deenaalee\" in Koyukon, a native language of Alaska currently spoken by just 300 people. Koyukon is part of the Athabaskan language family, which also includes Navajo and several Apache languages native to the American Southwest.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Deenaalee\" approximately translates to \"the High One,\" according to James Fall, an official at Alaska\u2019s Department of Fish and Game, and James Kari, a linguist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks\u2019 Native Language Center.\nObama called the name change \"a step to reflect the heritage of Alaska Natives.\"\nWhile the meme\u2019s claim is ridiculous, we were able to verify that the viral image does depict the real Denali.\nOur ruling\nThe meme claims \" \u2018Denali\u2019 is the Kenyan word for \u2018black power.\u2019 \"\nNope.\nThe word \"Denali\" doesn\u2019t show up in Swahili, one of Kenya\u2019s two national languages.
