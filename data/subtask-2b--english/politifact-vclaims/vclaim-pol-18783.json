Go do it. Most important Election of your life!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 27, 2020 \nThe answer is actually most likely no. (We\u2019ll deal later on with whether the question \"Can I change my vote\" was trending on Google.)\nVoting experts say this tactic is not as widely available as Trump suggested. It depends heavily on the status of your ballot.\u00a0\n\n\"It is not correct that most states allow you to cancel an already cast absentee ballot,\" said Matthew Weil, director of the Elections Project at the Bipartisan Policy Center. \"It depends on when processing begins and what processing means in that state. The majority of states would not allow voters to cancel already cast ballots.\"\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry for this article.\nHere are some scenarios when it comes to your ballot.\u00a0\nScenario 1: You\u2019ve received your mail ballot, and it\u2019s still in your possession.\nThis is the category that gives voters the most options.\nObviously, if you haven\u2019t marked your ballot yet, you can simply mark your current choice and submit it.\nIt gets a bit trickier if you\u2019ve marked your ballot, want to change your vote, but haven\u2019t turned in the ballot yet.\u00a0\nAn analysis of state election laws by ProPublica found that most states will allow people to cancel an as-yet unreturned ballot as long as they come in to vote in person and work with election officials to make sure their records indicate that the in-person vote is the one that should count. In some states, the voter will have to cast a provisional ballot in this situation. Often, election officials will need to take possession of the un-cast ballot and destroy it.\nScenario 2: You\u2019ve submitted your mail ballot.\nExperts say there are three states \u2014 Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan \u2014 that specifically allow you to change your mind and cast a new ballot before Election Day. But it depends on when you change your mind.\n\"Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan have clear rules about canceling an already cast absentee ballot,\" Weil said. However, Weil added that Minnesota\u2019s deadline for doing this has already passed.\nIn Connecticut, you may be able to change your mind, depending on what township you\u2019re voting in, added Jessica Huseman, who is the lead reporter for ProPublica\u2019s Electionland project, which covers election administration.\nThe key in all cases is whether your ballot has been tabulated yet. If it\u2019s been counted, you can\u2019t call it back.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Once the ballot envelopes are verified for eligibility and the ballots are removed from the envelope and put through a tabulator, that\u2019s the ball game,\" Weil said. \"Once a ballot is in a tabulator, it can\u2019t be canceled, because you can\u2019t link it back to a specific voter.\"\nSo, in a state that only starts counting ballots on Election Day, such as New York, it is possible for a person to vote in person and have that take precedence over a mail ballot you cast earlier. In other states, however, ballots are counted before Election Day, making this approach impossible.\nScenario 3: You\u2019ve voted in person, whether early or on Election Day.\nIf you\u2019ve voted in person, you\u2019re out of luck.\n\"I cannot think of a way for a person to change an in-person vote, because votes are secret and you can\u2019t call it back,\" Huseman said. \"This is the same reason that you can\u2019t recast an already-counted mail in vote, because after it leaves the envelope it is no longer traced to you.\"\nExperts said they aren\u2019t aware of solid data on how often ballots are called back because the voter changed their mind, but they said it\u2019s probably rare.\n\"It cannot be a huge number, since we know that most absentee ballots that are requested are ultimately counted as submitted,\" Weil said.\nWas there a spike in Google searches?\nFor the record, there was a spike in Google searching of \"Can I change my vote\" during the week of Oct. 18 to Oct. 24, though it had been rising fairly consistently since early September.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nStill, Trump\u2019s statement doesn\u2019t tell the whole story.\nOne potential reason that the phrase spiked on Google could be that, as Election Day gets closer, more voters are starting to research the voting process. That jibes with other Trends data that reveal an influx of searches for early and mail-in voting. In 2016, there was a similar uptick in searches for \"Can I change my vote?\" in the days leading up to Election Day.\nThis year, search interest in other voting-related phrases, such as \"Where can I vote?\" and \"early voting,\" also spiked around the same time that \"Can I change my vote?\" started to tick up. Google Trends says the top election-related searches from the past week are generic, such as \"election\" and \"polls.\"\nGoogle warns against reading too much into the data.\n\"A spike in a particular topic does not reflect that a topic is somehow \u2018popular\u2019 or \u2018winning,\u2019 only that for some unspecified reason, there appear to be many users performing a search about a topic,\" Google says in an FAQ page. \"Google Trends data should always be considered as one data point among others before drawing conclusions.\"\nOur ruling\nTrump tweeted, \"CAN I CHANGE MY VOTE? ... The answer in most states is YES.\"\nThis may be feasible for voters who have not yet returned their mail ballot, as long as they go in to vote in person and work with election officials to cancel their original ballot.\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click\u00a0here, for more\nHowever, only a handful of states explicitly allow ballots that have been cast to be called back prior to Election Day. And a voter would be entirely out of luck for changing their vote if their mail ballot has already been tabulated prior to Election Day, or if they voted early in person.\nWe rate the statement Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18783"}
