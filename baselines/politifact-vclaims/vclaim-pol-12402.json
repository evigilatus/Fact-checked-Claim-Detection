Often the debate ranks high on the rhetorical scale but is limited in hard facts.\n\nSo it got our attention when the International Premium Cigar & Pipe Retailers Association, based in Coumbus, Ga., released a statement last month by its legislative director, Chris McCalla, in opposition to an expansion of the DeKalb County smoking ban. McCalla claimed a similar ban in Ohio cost 5,400 jobs in one year to that state\u2019s hospitality industry.\n\nIt turns out the claim of Ohio job losses is popular among opponents of smoking bans. We found the claim repeated in letters to the editor in Alabama, on numerous pro-smoking blogs and in news aggregators like Yahoo! News that picked up the association\u2019s news release.\n\nBut where did that number come from? Naturally, the first place we looked was Ohio.\n\nThe figure of 5,400 jobs lost appears on the website of Opponents of Ohio Bans, a group opposed to the Ohio law approved by voters in 2006. Pam Parker, co-founder of the group, pointed back to the Georgia-based group as a possible source for the statistic.\n\n\"I believe that's a number that IPCPR has reported,\" Parker said in an email.\n\nParker also provided a link to a news release on unemployment figures from the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services showing 5,900 hospitality jobs lost in the state over the past year as a possible source. But that report -- part of a larger report on all nonfarm employment -- was from November 2009. The Ohio smoking ban began in May 2007, so the time periods do not match up.\n\nThe association referred all questions back to McCalla, but he did not return messages seeking clarification of his statement. A representative from the public relations firm that sent out the news release for the association also did not return calls.\n\nSo is there any evidence that McCalla\u2019s statement is correct?\n\nThe employment sector he claims coughed up so many jobs because of the smoking ban represents a wide-ranging group of industries that includes bars and restaurants but also takes in sports stadiums, hotels, museums and golf courses to name a few.\n\nBenjamin Johnson, a spokesman for the Ohio Department of Jobs and Family Services, said the sector lost 2,200 jobs during the first year of the state\u2019s smoking ban, less than half the claimed amount and a pretty small 0.4 percent decrease in overall employment.\n\nBy way of comparison, all nonfarm employment in the state declined by 39,400 during the same period, a decrease of about 0.7 percent, so it makes it tough to see the ban\u2019s direct impact on employment.\n\nOhio State University public health professor Elizabeth Klein said the research on the economic impact of smoking bans is not even something researchers argue about because of the \"high degree of consistency\" in numerous academic studies. The bans just do not do measurable economic harm. The only downside is that it is hard to get new research published, she said.\n\n\"From the academic perspective, most of us are over this. It\u2019s been well established,\" she said.\n\nDespite the academic consensus, this month Klein and her Ohio State colleague Nancy Hood published a study of bars and restaurants in Ohio that found the smoking ban did not have an effect on sales. Klein said the findings mirror her earlier study on the economic impact of a similar ban in Michigan.\n\nTaking a longer look, hospitality employment in Ohio has dropped 2.7 percent, but Klein said that is hardly surprising, given the recession.\n\n\"Ohio has had difficulty with employment in a number of areas,\" she said.\n\nIn fact, the hospitality industry has fared better than the overall economy in Ohio. Total nonfarm employment has dropped 6.3. percent since 2007, according to federal data.\n\nBack in Georgia, the point is almost entirely academic. In a meeting last week, amid warnings of economic consequences from opponents, the DeKalb County Board of Commissioners voted 4-2 against expanding the county\u2019s indoor smoking ban.\n\nWhen the smoke cleared, we rated this lost-jobs claim as False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-12402"}
