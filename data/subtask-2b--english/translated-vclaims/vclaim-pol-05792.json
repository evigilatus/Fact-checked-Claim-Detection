In the discussion held in Boulder, Colo, on 28 October 2015, the Committee &apos; s Director, Becky Quick Rubio, asked to what extent he was qualified to guide national fiscal policy when he had many financial problems. \"Oh, my God, Rubio, you said yourself you had problems. Quick, quoted from the 2012 book Rubio An American Son, said before citing several examples. \"You're mistakenly between campaign money and your personal money. You were facing a mortgage on a second house you bought. And last year, I cleared a $68,000 retirement fund. That's something that cost you thousands of dollars in taxes and penalties. \"In all this, it raises the question of whether you have the maturity and wisdom to lead this economy with $17 trillion. What do you think?\" I asked. Rubio's response was to reject all Quick examples as party defamation tactics. \"Well, you're just a list of suspicious attacks by my Democrats and political opponents, and I'm not gonna waste 60 seconds detailing them all,\" he said. Then he went to elaborate on his upbringing with immigrant parents. The response has led us to stop, because we have asked what is \"enclosed\" about the widely reported financial incidents of Rubio. In this context, \"unapproved\" means things that were said quickly are not correct or accurate. Rubio's campaign did not respond to our requests for comments, but we will take them one by one and explain what happened to her: \"You accidentally mix campaign money with your own money.\" Years before Rubio assumed the presidency of the Florida House of Representatives in 2006, two political committees were established to pay for travel and other expenses. An investigation conducted in the Tampa Bay Times and Miami Herald in 2010 found that it had not disclosed the payment of $34,000 of expenditure, including $7,000 for itself. He paid his wife Janet, who was the cashier of a committee, $5,700 for \"gas and meals.\" Rubio also gave relatives a further $14,000 and charged $51,000 as travel expenses on his credit cards. Speaking of credit cards: In 2005, the Republican Party in Florida gave him American Express expenses. Rubio received thousands of dollars in restaurant meals while his meals in Talahasi were covered by taxpayers as part of his presence in the State House. Rubio used to use the party card to pay personal expenses, which he paid later. These included a rented car, repair of his personal car, flights to Talahasi, family reunion and beaver work to his home. In total, more than $100,000 was spent between November 2006 and November 2008. The information was not disclosed before. In 2012, the Florida Ethics Commission rejected a complaint concerning citizens who had been filed during the Rubio Senate campaign in 2010. Rubio wrote in his book that the expenses were the result of a slight mix-up. \"For example, I pulled the wrong card from my wallet to pay for the pavements,\" books. Another time, \"a travel agent accidentally used the card to pay for family reunion in Georgia.\" \"Every time, I knew the fees and paid for myself, directly to American Express. The Republican Party in Florida didn't pay any of them. However, late, I hope that none of them have ever been charged.\" Facebook published on January 23, 2021 in social media \"Baiden invested the entire family's wealth in Ukrainian gas and oil. Then closes the Keystone pipeline. \u2022 January 28, 2012, Quick described these events accurately. \"I faced a mortgage in a second house I bought.\" In 2005, Rubio bought a house in Talahasi with the then Republic of David Rivera for $135,000. The husband used the house while he was in town on government business. The mortgage proceedings at the Talahasi house began in 2010 when Rivera, then the head of the Florida budget and running for Congress in Miami, failed to pay the mortgage payments for five months. The loan was designed for interest payments only on a mortgage at an adjustable rate until April 2010. Rubio and Rivera stopped paying the loan in February because of a dispute over the amount of payments after April. In June 2010, the German bank filed a lawsuit in the amount of $136,000, prompting Rivera to pay a hasty sum for the missing months. Detention procedures were suspended. Rivera later became involved in ethical investigations and kept Rubio at a distance. They sold the house in June 2015 for $117,000. It should be noted that the mortgage procedure did not continue, but Rubio \"face\" in a second house. \"And last year, I liquidated a retirement fund for $68,000. This has cost you thousands of dollars in taxes and penalties.\" Rubio revealed in May 2015 that he had spent the tax-receiving retirement account on 1 September 2014, and that the American Bar Association cash-pump account had been closed. \"It was only one specific account that we wanted to have access to cash next year, both because I'm running for president, but also, you know, my refrigerator broke down. That was $3,000. I had to replace the air conditioning unit at our house, \"Tell Rubio Fox News the host of Chris Wallace on Sunday. My kids all go to school as they get closer to college and school gets more expensive. And then when you run for president, we just wanted to get to the sum of that money.\" Because of the way in which most of the traditional independent regulatory bodies are regulated, Rubio has been able to put money in the account without paying taxes. When the account was closed, income taxes and a 10 per cent fine were likely to be paid by law, usually not recommended by mobile financial advisers. Taxes and penalties could have ranged from $24,000 to $30,000, but it was unclear how much had been paid. The quick description here is also accurate. Our rule, Rubio, said that the theory of questions about his financial skills was \"unapproved attacks by Democrats and opposition politicians.\" He was responding to the examples given by Quick when he asked him whether he was ready to oversee the nation's economy as President. The problems encountered by Rubio in keeping campaign books, booking procedures, and the liquidation of the IRA were reported with severe tax penalties. All these events have taken place and have been well documented. It is not accurate for Rubio to refer to cases as \"unapproved,\" whether or not his opponents used them to attack him. Speed wasn't making things up or shaking facts. We also appreciate Rubio's best article. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6a595865-463d-4975-981a-4e8332b0611d", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05792"}
