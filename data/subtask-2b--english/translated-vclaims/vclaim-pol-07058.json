She was attacked by the Republican opponent of Raimundo, Alan Fong, for urging the State to pay investors who bought the bonds of moral obligation used to raise funds for the company. In response, since October 7, 2014, the Raimundo campaign has repeatedly broadcast a television commercial called \"From the Start,\" which aims to address the controversy. \"Maybe I saw Alan Fong's announcement attack me on 38 studios,\" starts. \"I've fought 38 studios from the beginning.\" Raimundo repeated that claim in the discussions with Fong challenging that claim, saying that one e-mail did not constitute a fight. So who's right? First, a small background. In 2010, the General Assembly approved a bill authorizing Rhode Island Economic Development to secure up to $125 million in economic development bonds. The bill did not mention any potential beneficiary. However, within weeks, the beneficiary became clear when the Economic Development Centre approved a loan guarantee of $75 million for 38 studios. In the end, the company went bankrupt; the European Development Bank, now Rhode Island Trading, owes a total of $115.9 million in bonds, interest and fees. At least two prominent politicians, Rhode Island, strongly opposed the deal when it was proposed. Lincoln Shavi, when he was a candidate for governor as an independent in 2010, repeatedly urged EDC to reject the proposal. He repeatedly tried to address the Environmental Data Centre directly and appeared at one of his meetings, but rejected it. Then the Treasurer General Frank Caprio, who is also a democracy candidate for governor, eventually joined Shavi in opposing him, to the point where he was hollow. Donald Karsiri, Chairman of the Economic Development Commission, complained that \"the positions and positions taken by Mr. Caprio and Mr. Chavi only undermine the positive economic development steps taken by the State in recent years.\" Where was Raimundo, then a candidate for the post of Secretary of the General Fund, in all of this? On July 16, 2010, I wrote an e-mail to Keith Stokes, then EDC Director, expressing \"great concerns.\" On January 16, 2021, Jordan Rachel stated in Tweedda that the minimum wage of $15 per hour would raise the price of taco bill burrito to $38. By Bill McCarthy \u2022 20 January 2021 \"I'll follow very carefully in this,\" I wrote. \"The fact that many have seen and passed through is a red flag\" refers to other groups that have decided not to help finance project 38 studios. So she was clearly expressing serious concerns. In addition, Remundo's commercial references to the television newspaper Providence Journal on July 22, 2010, quote Ed Fitzpatrick Raimundo's column as saying, \"Really, this is a gamble. This company hasn't started a game yet. It's the pre-revenue period; they didn't make one penny. This could be very easy outside work in one or two years.\" The column appeared two days before EDC took its final vote on 38 transaction studios. Fitzpatrick, Rymundo's duel wrote: \"Investing capitalists prefer to spread risks between a portfolio of 20 to 30 companies, but this $75 million loan guarantee is a large part of the $125 million new job creation guarantee programme.\" Then I quote Raimundo: \"This strategy is like, \"Put all your chips on the red and tie your fingers. That makes me nervous.\" But neither example shows that Raimundo is actively fighting the project. We asked the Raimundo campaign if she had any evidence of the candidate trying to block the deal. Ms. Joey Fox said that Raimundo met with Stokes separately with Carl Weidenston, the only member of the European Defence Council who voted against the motion. We checked with Waidenston. He asked her about the deal pending during commercial breaks when she was on his radio show WPRO. He asked about Raimundo's claim that she fought the deal, he answered, \"With whom? That's what I'm trying to understand. With who? I had already made my decision at that stage.\" He said he didn't remember how badly I advised against the deal. The governor Jenna Raimundo says, \"I've fought 38 studios from the beginning.\" It's clear that Raimundo had concerns about the deal. But calling something \"gamble,\" saying a deal that makes you \"annoying\" and urging someone to \"directly with extreme caution\" points to the opposition but does not rise to the level of combat. We couldn't find -- and her campaign couldn't produce -- any evidence that she actively tried to block loan for 38 studios or she specifically told anyone in authority that the deal should be rejected. To say that \"bought 38 studios\" is a big stretch. We're assessing her claim as mostly wrong.
