They could face felony charges, prison time and up to $250,000 in fines.\nThe state House and Senate approved the bill this week, but\u00a0Gov. Roy Cooper vetoed it Thursday\u00a0and it remains to be seen whether lawmakers will pass it over his opposition. Democrats have opposed it, saying newborns are already protected and the bill is meant to intimidate medical care providers. Republicans have voiced concern for infants born alive during an abortion.\nSen. Joyce Krawiec, a Republican from Kernersville and one of the bill sponsors, said during an April 15 speech on the Senate floor that protections are needed.\n\"No, we do not have laws in place protecting babies who are born alive as the result of an abortion,\" she said, according to\u00a0WRAL.\nLegal experts disagree.\nMANY PROTECTIONS\nLegal experts say a range of laws protect newborns regardless of the circumstances of their birth. In other words, newborns are protected even if they enter the world during the course of an abortion.\nThe U.S. Constitution\u2019s Equal Protection Clause and Due Process Clause, state constitutions, and a variety of homicide laws also apply, said\u00a0Neil Siegel, an attorney and professor at Duke Law School.\n\"If you have a baby born alive, it doesn\u2019t matter if it was born from a failed abortion or otherwise \u2026 it\u2019s entitled to full constitutional protections,\" Siegel said in a phone interview.\nAfter the U.S. Senate took up a bill with the same name, PolitiFact addressed this topic in an\u00a0in-depth story\u00a0and fact check of President Donald Trump.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJenna Wadsworth\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth Carolina Secretary of State Elaine Marshall \"has won more statewide races than probably anyone else alive.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Paul Specht \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperts pointed to the\u00a0Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, first passed in 1974 and subsequently revised, including major updates in the 1980s. The relevant portion of the law makes certain types of federal funding for states conditional on their adoption of policies to prevent improper withholding of treatment from newborns, including those with disabilities.\nThe newborns are also protected under the \"Born-Alive Infants Protection Act\" of 2002. The act defines \"born alive\" to mean: \"the complete expulsion or extraction\" from a mother \"at any stage of development,\" regardless of whether they were extracted during an \"induced abortion.\"\nThe 2002 act, however, didn\u2019t directly create civil or criminal penalties. It is \"toothless and purely symbolic,\" said Dwight Duncan, a University of Massachusetts law professor who serves on the the boards of the Pro-Life Legal Defense Fund and Massachusetts Citizens for Life.\nFilling that omission was a key motivator for supporters of the bill introduced in Washington earlier this year.\nINTENDED TO CLARIFY\nKrawiec didn\u2019t respond to a PolitiFact email seeking comment. Bill D\u2019Elia, a spokesman for Senate leader Phil Berger, acknowledged that there are relevant laws already on the books.\n\"Under current state law, an intentional killing of a baby is covered by our murder statutes and a killing of an unborn baby is covered by the Unborn Victims of Violence Act, but there is no current statute that covers deliberately withholding care to a child born alive during an abortion,\" D\u2019Elia said.\n\"In theory, a medical professional could be charged with manslaughter for withholding care but it is not explicit in current state law,\" D\u2019Elia said. But, he added, SB 359 makes it \"clear.\"\nGreg Doucette, a\u00a0criminal defense and business litigation attorney\u00a0based in Durham, said existing state laws would likely apply to doctors who withhold care.\n\"If a parent doesn\u2019t feed their newborn and it dies, they get charged with murder. I don\u2019t see why a medical provider would be substantively different,\" Doucette said.\nOUR RULING\nOn the Senate floor, Krawiec said \"we do not have laws in place protecting babies who are born alive as the result of an abortion.\" That\u2019s not true. There are federal and state laws that protect infants as soon as they emerge from their mother\u2019s womb \u2014 regardless of the circumstances.
