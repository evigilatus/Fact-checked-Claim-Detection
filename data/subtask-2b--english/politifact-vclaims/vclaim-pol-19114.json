Andrew Cuomo to throw people in detainment camps.\n\"New York is trying to pass a bill that would allow them to round up non mask wearers and people who don\u2019t want to take the vaccine into concentration camps,\" one popular post on Facebook reads. \"Then with a court order they can force vaccinate you.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThis is wrong, and a faulty interpretation of the bill in question, A416.\u00a0\nWhile the legislation may be applicable in the COVID-19 era, the bill has been dormant since it was drafted and proposed during the 2015 Ebola outbreak, before a vaccine for the disease was approved.\u00a0\nThe bill specifies that it applies to infected people and their contacts who refuse to quarantine in a health emergency.\u00a0\nLike other evergreen bills that get introduced year after year with little regard, the legislation has never been heard by committee. It was introduced for the state's\u00a02021-22 legislative session, but it was also introduced\u00a0in the 2015-16, 2017-18 and 2019-20 sessions and has never had a co-sponsor.\nAn idea during the Ebola crisis\u00a0\nAssembly bill 416 was introduced by Assemblyman N. Nick Perry, D- Brooklyn, and is described as: \"An act to amend the public health law, in relation to the removal of cases, contacts and carriers of communicable diseases who are potentially dangerous to the public health.\"\nFrank Shea, Perry\u2019s communications director, said the assemblyman proposed the legislation in 2015 after a nurse who worked closely with Ebola patients in Africa refused to quarantine upon returning to the United States. It was designed to be similar to existing laws that allow for the detainment of mental health patients who are deemed to be a danger to themselves or others.\nThe bill says that during a health emergency, officials would have the authority to detain in a medical or \"other appropriate facility\" any infected persons and their contacts who are deemed a threat to the public. It also says that, if the detentions last longer than three business days, the state would need a court order.\n\"The assemblyman thought that we needed a mechanism for the government to say that we can\u2019t have someone with this type of communicable disease who says \u2018the hell with the rest of you\u2019 and travels on our trains and buses and goes into our schools,\" Shea said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Gateway Pundit\n\n\nstated on January 20, 2021 in an article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWHO admits their testing grossly overstates individuals testing positive for COVID.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Noah Y. Kim \u2022 January 22, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIts creation had nothing to do with the COVID-19 crisis, he added, and despite being reintroduced, Perry hasn\u2019t pushed the bill or solicited sponsorships.\nBill isn\u2019t going anywhere\nRepublican U.S. Rep. Lee Zeldin of Suffolk released a statement rebuking the bill on Jan. 3, and initially claimed that it was scheduled \"to be taken up by the New York State Assembly\u2019s Health Committee on Wednesday, January 6, 2021.\"\u00a0\nBut that isn\u2019t true. The Assembly has no committee hearings on its schedule that day, the first day of session.\u00a0\nOn Jan. 3 Politico reported that it received no reply from Zeldin\u2019s office about where he got the information that the Health Committee was taking up the bill. Zeldin\u2019s statement appears to have been amended shortly after to say that the bill will instead be \"referred\" to the committee that day.\u00a0\nCuomo\u2019s office, meanwhile, says they weren\u2019t aware of the bill until recently.\n\"No, the governor doesn\u2019t want to open up concentration camps,\" Cuomo\u2019s senior adviser, Rich Azzopardi, told PolitiFact. \"We didn\u2019t even know this bill existed.\"\u00a0\nPerry says he\u2019s receiving threats over the bill and wrote in an emailed statement that he\u2019s open to amendments that would address concerns raised by critics. In this statement, he urged a careful reading of the bill.\n\"There is no intent, no plan, or provisions in my bill to take away, or violate any rights, or liberties that all Americans are entitled to under our Constitution, either state or federal,\" the statement says. \"A proper reading of the bill would find that significant attention was paid to protect individual rights which could be affected by exercising the authority granted in this bill.\"\nOur ruling\nSocial media posts claim that New York officials are trying to pass a bill that would allow them to round up non-mask wearers and those who don\u2019t want to get vaccinated into \"concentration camps\" to eventually force vaccinations for COVID-19.\nThis is wrong. While the bill, A416, may be applicable in the COVID-19 era, it has sat dormant since it was introduced in 2015 during the Ebola outbreak and\u00a0has not gained any traction in the New York State Assembly. The legislation specifies that it applies to infected people and their contacts who refuse to quarantine in a health emergency.\nThe bill has no co-sponsors and has never once been heard by committee despite being introduced in the 2015-16, 2017-18, 2019-20 sessions, and the current session.\u00a0\nWe rate this False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19114"}
