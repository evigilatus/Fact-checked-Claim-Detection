Speaking of opiates in videos uploaded on his Facebook page, Ojeda said: \"We have lost more lives in the last two years -- 60,000 years ago and we are already going through this year -- than all the lives lost during the Vietnam War,\" he said on 24 October. Did Ojeda -- a Democrat who has since announced his interest in running for president -- get his statistics correctly? We didn't hear a response from Ojeda's campaign, but we located the data to answer that question. The policy previously put the number of American servicemen killed in the Vietnam War at 58,220. The most accurate statistics we can find are the number of deaths from opioids, identified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as deaths caused by opioid analgesics, heroin or illicit synthetic opioids. The data do not cover 2018, so we took the \"last two years\" to mean the last two years where the data are available, 2016 and 2017. In 2016, the CDC found that 42,249 Americans died of overdoses of opiates. In 2017, according to the preliminary figures of the Centre for Disease Control issued in August 2018, the number of deaths from overdoses of opioids rose to 49,068. On January 14, 2021, Chuck Grasley stated in a tweet that insulin prices had \"lost the RoOOF for patients/taxpayers bc from the manufacturer, a health plan and PBM Biz practices.\" By Madison Black: 2 February 2021, combined, the number of Opiates overdose deaths in 2016 and 2017 was 91,317 -- much higher than the number of deaths in the United States in the Vietnam War. It appears that Ojeda's reference to the death of 60,000 people two years ago contains broader statistics - the number of overdose deaths for all drugs, not just opiates. The number of deaths in this category in 2016 and 2017 was 63,632 and 72,306, respectively. Using these broader statistics, it remains valid: 135,938 overdoses of all medicines over these two years, well above the number of deaths of members of the service in Viet Nam. \"We've lost more lives in the last two years\" said Ojeda, \"from opiates, \"of all the lives lost during the Vietnam war.\" More than 90,000 people died of overdoses of opiates in 2016 and 2017 combined, and more than 135,000 died of all overdoses of drugs in those two years. Both are higher than 58,220 deaths of a member of the American Service in Vietnam. We're assessing the claim right.
