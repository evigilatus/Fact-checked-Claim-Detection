News stories and Facebook posts pointed out that searches in the UK on basic questions like \"what is the EU?\" and \"what does it mean to leave the EU?\" spiked after the Brexit vote.\nDaily Mail, a daily British tabloid, posted an article with the headline: \"Google search spike suggests many people don\u2019t know why they voted for Brexit.\" The paper pointed to a spike in the query \"what happens if we leave the EU,\" as evidence voters were unaware they voted to leave.\n\nThe Washington Post also posted an article on the trend implying that voters in the United Kingdom didn\u2019t know exactly what they were voting for.\nEven John Oliver poked fun at the trend on HBO\u2019s Last Week Tonight.\n\"It\u2019s frankly hard not to think that some Britons may not have fully thought this through,\" Oliver said \"Especially when you look at some of the top search terms concerning the EU the next day.\"\nBut the Google Trends don\u2019t show that at all, in reality. Here\u2019s why.\nWhat Google Trends tells us (and doesn\u2019t)\nGoogle Trends launched 10 years ago as a way to allow users to track the popularity of a search item in relation to an event. The search data categorizes searches into related groups and then measures the interest in a particular topic across searches\u00a0from around the world, right down to cities.\nFor example, these were the top five questions in the United Kingdom on Google Trends after the Brexit vote on June 23. The queries represent the most-searched items relating to the European Union.\n\nWhat Google Trends doesn\u2019t tell us is who is actually doing the searching. So there\u2019s no way to tell if the searches were done by Brexit voters.\nAnother issue is the significance of the searches in comparison to other factors. A 250 percent spike doesn\u2019t mean much if not many people were searching \"what happens if we leave the EU?\" prior to the report.\nThe number of searches before the vote is hard to determine\n\"The problem with Google Trends is that it's essentially a black box,\" said Pete Meyers, a marketing scientist at Moz which sells marketing analytics software subscriptions. \"There's a lot we don't know about what goes into the number, and everything is relative.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor instance, when you look at \"What is the EU,\" on Google Trends, you see a spike. But when you add the term \"Brexit\" to the same graph the spike seems far less severe, he said. Although the raw totals of searches are not shown, the Trends data shows searches for\u00a0\"Brexit\" were much higher than \"What is the EU?\" on June 24, the day after the vote. \u00a0\n\nGoogle Trends looks at a random sample of all searches, so you don\u2019t see the total number of specific searches. The numbers on the chart represent a probability of how highly searched a query is, ranked from 1 to 100. This allows Google to compare two terms against one another.\nThe volume of searches can be a self-fulfilling prophecy, Meyers said.\n\"If Google reports that a lot of people are searching for \u2018What is the EU?\u2019 and then the press picks it up, curiosity leads people to run similar searches to see what the fuss is about,\" Meyers said.\nHe said he can\u2019t prove that\u2019s what happened here, but it has happened in the past.\nAnother major flaw in using Google Trends to make bold pronouncements like the Daily Mail is that the most common way to search something is usually the term that shows up at the top, said Marti Hearst, a professor for the University of California at Berkeley\u2019s school of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences.\n\"Only the most common (and therefore the most ignorant-sounding) search queries will make it to the top,\" Hearst said.\nIn other words, nuance questions like, \"How does Northumberland elected representative to the EU support our interests,\" would not surface to the top, she said. \u00a0\nExperts agreed that the way many news outlets used the Google Trends reports is not grounded in science.\n\"The numbers shown to the public are processed in many ways and are meant to be very general trends only,\" Hearst said.\nThe claims that publications are making go too far, said Tom Davenport, the President\u2019s Distinguished Professor of Information Technology and Management at Babson College.\n\"I might interpret the findings more positively,\" Davenport said. \"At least a lot of people have curiosity and are trying to learn more about the Brexit topic.\"\nOur ruling\nLike other media accounts, the Daily Mail headline said \"Google search spike suggests many people don\u2019t know why they voted for Brexit.\"\nThis is misleading. It\u2019s impossible to say if UK voters were the ones doing these searches, and the numbers of searches are hard to determine. Relative to searches for \"Brexit,\" searches about \"what is the EU\" were far less common.\nWe know people searched \"What is the EU\" and \"What will happen if we leave the EU,\" but we don\u2019t know why or how many. Point being, there\u2019s no evidence to fill those gaps.\nWe rate this claim Mostly False.\n Share the Facts 2017-09-30 13:41:55 UTC   PolitiFact    3 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly False  https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3657997/Britain-s-Google-searches-hint-people-didn-t-know-voting-for.html \"Google search spike suggests many people don\u2019t know why they voted for Brexit.\"     Daily Mail Website   In an article Friday, June 24, 2016 2016-06-24    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04745"}
