In Fairfax County, Fa., a rich province only 350 miles away, life expectancy was approximately 82 years, a difference of 18 years. The gap in the life expectancy of women in the two provinces was 12 years.\" Was Saunders right? We've had a good look. (Sanders campaign did not respond to any query.) Let us begin by pointing out that the two provinces are in fact in opposing sides of the income spectrum. According to the United States Census Bureau, McDowell County, at the heart of the coal country of Apalashian, has an average household income of $25,595, or about 44 per cent of the national average household income of $57,652. In contrast, the average household income in Fairfax County, rich suburbs of Washington, D.C., is $117,515, slightly more than double the national average. So the average household income is four times higher in Fairfax County than in McDowell County. What about life expectancy? The Washington University Institute of Health Measurement and Assessment collects the longest current data on life expectancy per province in the United States. We used the Institute's interactive database to find the most up-to-date data for both of the provinces that Sanders mentioned. Here is a summary of 2014, the last available year: Kirk Cox was mentioned in a speech delivered on 13 January 2021. Virginia ranked lowest third of the states in the management of the COVID-19 vaccine. \u2022 On 20 January 2021, the data show that life expectancy is a few years longer than what Sanders said about men in MacDowell District - 67 instead of 64 - making the gap between men and the province 15 years, instead of the 18-year figure mentioned by Sanders. For women, Sanders is also a little distant - there is a gap of 11 years rather than a gap of 12 years. But while Sanders has a few numbers, his general view is sound. In fact, people in Fairfax can not only expect to live longer than the residents of McDowell County, but the gap between the two has been widening for nearly four decades. This graph shows the life expectancy of men and women, both in the provinces since 1980. The figures for McDowell County are shown in red, and the figures for Fairfax County are shown in green. It is easy to see the directions going in two opposite directions. It seems that a comparison of Sanders actually appeared more than five years ago, in an article by Annie Lowry in the New York Times. She wrote: Fairfax County, Va County, McDowell County, W.Va., between them 350 miles, about half a day by car. :: Travel west of Fairfax province, the communities connected, and the engineering of military contractors, allow for discovery, then agricultural land and, ultimately, to McDowell coal mines and forest slopes for Alabaches. Perhaps the largest distance between the two provinces is: Fairfax is a place for owners, and McDowell is one of those who don't. One of the most terrible results of that division... is seen in the life expected of people there. The population of Fairfax is among the longest in the country: men have an average life expectancy of 82 years, while women are 85 years, which is almost the same as in Sweden. In McDowell, the average is 64 and 73, which is roughly the same as in Iraq. Our government said, \"In 2014... in McDowell County, W.Va., one of the poorest districts in the country, men's life expectancy was 64 years. In Fairfax County, Fa., a rich province only 350 miles away, life expectancy was approximately 82 years, a difference of 18 years. The gap in the life expectancy of women in the two provinces was 12 years.\" A few of these figures are slightly lower, but the general point of Sanders is that there is a significant gap in life expectancy between the two provinces. We're mostly ruling his statement, right?", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00421"}
