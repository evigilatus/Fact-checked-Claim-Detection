Well, you son of a bitch, he's been fired.\" He then followed up on the announcement: \"In fact: the prosecutor said that he was forced to lead an investigation into corruption to Hunter Bayden. The truth: Democrats want to accuse President Trump of discussing this investigation with the President of Ukraine. The truth: Donald Trump won, but the Democrats want to turn the elections.\" This announcement distorts the well-known facts about Ukrainian Attorney General Viktor Shokin and the Ukrainian Energy Company Purisama Holdings, where the son of Paiden Hunter Biden served on the board of directors. The Trump campaign announced the television commercial on October 9th. It has also appeared in social media. \u2022 Biden wanted to expel Shokin, but Western leaders have widely criticized the prosecutor as corrupt and ineffective. Biden was leading a broad consensus on the removal request. \u2022 A former Ukrainian official said that the investigation into the Borisama case was inactive under the auspices of Shokkin. \u2022 The Democrats initiated an investigation into the removal from Trump's statements that he wanted Ukraine to investigate a political competitor in exchange for political favouritism. \"Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire its prosecutor.\" Biden called on Ukraine to expel Shokkin, but the announcement did not note that there were widespread calls for his expulsion. Biden played a leading role in American diplomacy towards Ukraine after a popular revolution in early 2014 that led to the flight of the country &apos; s loyal Russian President, Viktor Yanukovych. Chokin became the Supreme Prosecutor in 2015, after Yanukovych went into exile. In December 2015, Baden, frustrated, threatened to book $1 billion unless Shokkin was expelled, in the hope that a new prosecutor would do more to enforce the law. According to Paden, it worked. The Trump campaign announcement contains a passage of Paiden's partial reports at an event organized by the Council of External Relations in January 23, 2018. He spoke of a commitment from then Ukrainian President Petru Poroshenko and then Prime Minister Arseni Yatsinuk. \"I looked at them and said, \"I'm leaving in six hours,\" said Biden. \"If the prosecutor is not fired, you won't get the money. He's been fired. They were put in the place of someone who was solid at the time.\" The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 January 11, 2021: \"The Prosecutor said that he was forced to lead a corruption investigation into Hunter Bayden.\" There is evidence that many Western leaders and institutions, as well as Ukrainian anti-corruption activists, have been considered corrupt and ineffective for failing to prosecute any significant person, and to protect members of the Yanukovych and Prochenko districts. When Shokin was expelled in the spring of 2016, press reports explicitly linked his expulsion to corruption. Stephen Beaver, an employee of the foreign service who held positions in the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations, had previously told Politi Fuckett that \"almost everyone\" knew him in the United States government and almost all non-governmental experts in Ukraine \"know that Shokkin is not doing his job and should be expelled.\" \"All decent people were in favor of the expulsion of Shoken,\" Anders Aslund, a fellow resident of the Atlantic Council told Politi Fact. Paden led the Western Anti-Corruption Consensus. Chokin inherited some investigation into Borisma and her owner, Zlushevski. In a statement he recently stated that his refusal to formally close the investigation had led to his expulsion. However, in 2019, Vitaly Kasco, who served as the deputy of the complainants overseeing international cooperation until he resigned in protest, told Bloomberg that the investigation in Borisma had remained inactive under Shokin. Casco said it was \"described by Ukrainian prosecutors in 2014 until 2015\" and Bloomberg said that the documents supported his account. The Trump campaign referred to reports from The New York Times that Yuri Lutsenko, a subsequent prosecutor, initially acquitted Purisama and reopened the investigation in March. At the very least, the credibility of Shokkin in discussing the case has been weakened by other evidence and extensive descriptions of his office as not interested in prosecuting corruption cases. The Declaration states that \"Democrats want to accuse President Trump of discussing this investigation with the President of Ukraine.\" The announcement of Trump speaks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelinski on July 25 by describing it as a mere discussion. The announcement deletes that the summary of the call shows that Trump encourages Zelinski to work with Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal lawyer, and Prosecutor William Bar and \"search in\" Biden. Before the appeal, Trump froze $400 million in assistance to Ukraine. The seizure of the money was lifted on 11 September. She announced that the Chamber of Deputies would proceed with the investigation into the isolation in September. The Democrats are investigating whether Trump abused his presidential authority by withholding assistance while asking his government to consider Piden as his potential counter for 2020. It has not yet drafted materials for isolation. Our verdict in Trump's announcement says, \"The act: Joe Biden put pressure on Ukraine to fire its prosecutor... The fact is, the D.A. said he was forced to lead a corruption investigation at Hunter Bayden. The truth: Democrats want to accuse President Trump of discussing this investigation with the President of Ukraine.\" Paiden invited Ukraine to fire Shoken, the prosecutor, but he did many others. The facts show that Biden wanted to remove chocolate because of widespread fears that Shocoin was not effective in pursuing corruption cases - not that he was following cases very violently. The Trump campaign refers to Shokin himself, but it is not a reliable source. The Democrats want to accuse Trump of using foreign policy to promote his re-election, not his desire to investigate corruption. This declaration claims to be a compilation of \"facts,\" but the presentation and lack of context is so misleading that it is inaccurate. We're assessing this statement wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00071"}
