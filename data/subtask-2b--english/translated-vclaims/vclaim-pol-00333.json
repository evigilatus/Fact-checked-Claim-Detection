It's not. This is the complete confirmation of Thompson's broadcast on ABC 27 June: \"The post-study study showed that the death penalty deters murders. Some studies show really interesting effects, with each execution of a murderer deterring up to 18 murders or more. That's according to Emory University professors who also found that the delay in the execution also leads to more murders. Most studies have concluded that a number of murders ranging from 3 to 18 are prohibited for each application of the death penalty.\" Twelve research papers in the past six years support Thompson's assertion that the death penalty prohibits murder, according to Associated Press. Three studies receive the greatest attention: a 2006 report by two economists and statistical papers in 2003 and 2006 by Emory researchers. On January 13, 2021, General David H. Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for the use of marines for security, saying, \"We're not working for you.\" By Samantha Butterman, on January 17, 2021, the star of law and order accurately quotes Emory's study, but his circulars on \"most studies\" ignore important dissenting research. A bunch of studies directly challenge the pro-defensive results by highlighting various methodological errors. \"These studies do not meet the standards required of the social sciences to make such strong claims, and standards such as repetition and basic comparisons with other scenarios,\" was said by Jeffrey Fagan of Columbia Law School during testimony to a New York legislative panel. This was highlighted in a paper presented by two colleagues from the National Bureau of Economic Research, in which they concluded that \"implementing policy drives little variation from year to year in homicide rates. As to whether executions are rising or lowering the homicide rate, we are still largely uncertain.\"", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00333"}
