In an address to Congress in March, Trump said his budget \"calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history,\" which we rated Mostly False.\nHis brag in Youngstown is more overblown, and more inaccurate. The White House did not provide information for this fact-check.\nThe increase in defense spending is not historic. Trump\u2019s proposed base spending cap for 2017-18 defense spending is $603 billion, a 9.4 percent increase.\nThere have been 10 years since 1977 when the base level\u00a0has gone up by more than that, and in some years, the increase more than doubled Trump\u2019s.\nIn 1981, President Ronald Reagan hiked the spending cap by 24.9 percent and by 20.4 percent the following year. More recently, President George W. Bush bumped spending by 10 percent in 2009.\nThe Center for Strategic and International Studies mapped these changes below.\n\nBase defense budget doesn\u2019t include war-related funding, though. If we were to include that funding, the statistics are less in Trump's\u00a0favor. Trump\u2019s proposed budget represents a 5.4 percent increase in the total defense budget, but we\u2019ve also had greater increases in the past.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Jimmy Carter increased military spending by 25 percent in 1981 and President Ronald Reagan\u2019s added another 20 percent the next year. President George W. Bush raised the defense budget by 27 percent in 2003, 13 percent in 2007 and nearly 12 percent in 2008.\nThis time, Trump wasn\u2019t just saying he proposed one of the largest increases; he said he had already \"achieved\" it. The spending has not yet been approved.\nTo turn his proposal into a reality, Trump will need\u00a0Congress to appropriate the necessary funding for fiscal year 2018 as well as change the budget caps currently in effect.\n\"Trump\u2019s defense budget is $54 billion above the budget cap already set in law,\" said Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"And to change the budget cap he needs 60 votes in the Senate, so in some ways it\u2019s actually more difficult to change the budget cap than to pass a health care bill.\"\nIn Trump\u2019s defense, Harrison said that his proposed defense budget is among the highest in history (though still not the highest) because the proposed increase comes on top of a defense budget that is already high by historical standards.\nBut Trump was talking specifically about an increase.\nOur ruling\nTrump said, \"We've achieved a historic increase in defense spending to get our troops the support they so richly deserve.\"\nThe defense spending increase Trump laid out in his 2018 budget is not an unprecedented change, regardless of whether it includes war-related spending.\nIt\u2019s also not the done deal Trump described. In order to actually increase defense spending, Congress will have to appropriate the funding and raise the budget cap.\nWe rate this statement False.\n Share the Facts 2017-07-27 12:12:29 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  \"We've achieved a historic increase in defense spending to get our troops the support they so richly deserve.\"    Donald Trump President of the United States   in a speech Tuesday, July 25, 2017 2017-07-25    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03061"}
