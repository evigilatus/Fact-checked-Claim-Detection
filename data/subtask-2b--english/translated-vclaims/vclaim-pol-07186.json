If the voters agree in November, Oregon will join another 10 states and the District of Columbia in issuing driving cards to those who cannot legally prove their presence in the United States. Larson strongly opposes this measure and takes every opportunity to say so in his daily broadcast. Claim: He recently sent us a series of e-mails, which he said he checked with one of his card confirmations: the Transport Security Department will accept \"driving privilege\" cards as valid identification cards for a commercial aircraft. \"I've spoken to TSA and I have e-mails to support the fact that TSA will accept DRIVERS identification cards at the airport,\" wrote in one. However, the ballot for this measure states: \"The driver's card may not be used as an identity card for air travel, to enter a federal building, to register to vote, or to obtain any government benefit requiring proof of citizenship or legal presence in the United States.\" Could the language of the ballot scale be wrong? Polyte Fact Oregon has decided to check. Analysis: Many opinion articles in the press, including one written by former Head of the Hillsboro Police, Ron Lowe, says that the driver's cards will not be fit to board a plane. On February 1, 2021, Tom Cotton mentioned in an interview with Fox and friends \"Many of these arriving immigrants, we have no way of checking their background for either health or security.\" \u2022 3 February 2021 Casa Oregon, a leading group in the rights of migrants, agrees. \"The Ballot 88 measure clearly states that it will only be issued for the granting of driving privileges and prohibits the use of driver's cards for anything other than listed purposes,\" wrote by Eric Sorensen's spokesman in the e-mail. However, the Drivers and Car Services Division in Oregon added confusion in the \"often asking questions\" document prepared for Measure 88. In response to the question, \"Can I use the driver's ID card for a plane ride?\" The document states: \"It will be up to the Transport Security Agency or the individual airport to determine whether the driver's card should be accepted as an identification card.\" According to an e-mail that he shared with us, a spokesman for the Transportation Security Agency in Washington, D.C., wrote to Larson: \"The driver's license is a valid form of identity for the Transport Security Agency.\" We contacted a TSA official on our own, Niko Mel\u00e9ndez, spokesman for the Western District Transport Security Agency in California. After investigating Oregon officials and management lawyers in a telephone interview, Melendez said: \"The State's driving cards will be acceptable forms of identifying our auditors at the airport. At this stage, it is understood that such a card would be an acceptable form of identification.\" Whether an air passenger offered a driver &apos; s licence or driver &apos; s card to a TSA representative did not matter. \"What we do is make sure that the person who shows the card is the person who travels,\" said Melendez. \"It's not an immigration check.\" Decision: In November 2014, Oregon voters will decide on the fate of measure 88, which, if adopted, will allow the Car Department to issue driving cards to Oregon residents who cannot prove their legal residence. According to the proponents and the polling scale itself, the cards cannot be used to board the aircraft. However, officials of the Transport Security Agency - persons checking passengers on board aircraft - say otherwise. We're ruling Larson's claim right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07186"}
