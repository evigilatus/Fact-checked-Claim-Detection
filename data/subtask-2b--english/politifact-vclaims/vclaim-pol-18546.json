Once the votes are certified, they CANNOT be audited for fraud!!! 47 additional counties used the same software that caused a \u2018glitch\u2019 in Antrim County (that switched 6,000 votes from Trump to Biden in that county).\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nNugent has some facts mixed up. Sixty-five Michigan counties, not 47, use the Dominion Voting Systems software, including Antrim County. And while Antrim County discovered an incorrect tally that made it appear as if Biden was winning there by about 3,000 votes, it was the only county to experience such an incident.\u00a0\nAlso, the \"glitch\" had nothing to do with the technology \u2014 it was a mistake made by the clerk.\u00a0\nThe day after the Nov. 3 election, while votes were still being counted, Antrim County appeared to have swung to Joe Biden by about 3,000 votes. On Nov. 5, county officials changed that to show Trump winning by about 2,500 votes. We reached out to Nugent and didn\u2019t hear back. But the difference between these two figures \u2014 5,500 votes \u2014 may be the source of the \"6,000\" figure he used to describe votes he said were switched to Biden.\nJ. Alex Halderman, a University of Michigan professor and voting systems expert, dug into the problem and told our partners at the Detroit Free Press that county elections officials had left an old version of a key file on some machines in their digital voting system. As a result, those machines failed to properly match votes to candidates when tallies at some precincts were added to the county total.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe inaccurate count was never an official result and the Michigan secretary of state\u2019s office also said it came down to a human error by the Antrim County clerk, not a failure in Dominion\u2019s system.\n\"Because the clerk did not update software, even though the tabulators counted all the ballots correctly, those accurate results were not combined properly when the clerk reported unofficial results,\" the Nov. 6 statement said.\nDominion Voting Systems has become the subject of online disinformation that seeks to tie it to Democrats or blame it for clerical errors in the ballot-counting process.\nRELATED: No evidence Dominion Voting Systems caused widespread tabulation errors that flipped votes for Biden\u00a0\n\"No credible reports or evidence of any software issues exist,\" Dominion says on its website. \"While no election is without isolated issues, Dominion Voting Systems are reliably and accurately counting ballots.
