This is what he\u2019s done to Newark,\" Lonegan said. \"So he\u2019s done using Newark as a stepping stone. Now he wants to go to Washington, D.C. and do exactly the same thing to the country.\"\nWhile Lonegan is correct that Newark has seen an increase in overall violent crime over the course of Booker\u2019s tenure, his statement is inaccurate and misleading, according to crime statistics compiled through the FBI\u2019s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program.\nLonegan is wrong to say violent crime and murders have increased \"five years in a row,\" since there were decreases in some of those years. In addition, the numbers in three of the four violent crime categories in 2012 were below their levels from 2007, Booker\u2019s first full year in office.\nLonegan spokesman Will Gattenby said the candidate was trying to make the point that violent crime in Newark has increased significantly since 2007. Booker took office in July 2006.\n\"The number of violent crimes per year has increased during Cory Booker\u2019s tenure,\" Gattenby said in an e-mail.\nThe UCR program also includes data on overall property crime -- which has dropped since the start of Booker\u2019s tenure -- but this fact-check is focused on violent crime, since that was the subject of Lonegan\u2019s claim.\nUnder the UCR program, violent crime is defined to include murders, forcible rapes, robberies and aggravated assaults. Over the past five years, each category has seen a mix of yearly decreases and increases.\nTo analyze Lonegan\u2019s statement, PolitiFact New Jersey reviewed UCR statistics for Newark for 2007 through 2012. The 2012 figures, reported by the Newark Police Department, are preliminary.\nWhile Lonegan said there have been increases for \"five years in a row,\" overall violent crime only increased annually in three of the five years between 2008 and 2012. Murders increased in four of the years.\nOverall violent crime dropped in 2009 and 2012, compared to the preceding years.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in remarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMurders have increased every year since 2009, but in 2008, there was a nearly 36 percent drop to 67 murders from 104 in 2007. In recent years, the number of murders has increased minimally, going from 90 in 2010 to 95 in 2012.\nBetween 2007 and 2012, overall violent crime in Newark increased from 2,415 offenses in 2007 to 3,219 last year, marking an increase of about 33 percent.\nBut that increase was driven by only one of the four violent crime categories. In 2012, the only category higher than its respective 2007 figure was robberies.\nThere were 1,976 robberies last year, marking a nearly 79 percent increase over the 1,104 in 2007.\nBy comparison, the 95 murders in 2012 were almost 9 percent less than the 104 murders in 2007. In fact, since 2008, the number of yearly murders in Newark has never exceeded the 2007 level.\nIn 2012, the numbers of forcible rapes and aggravated assaults were down from their 2007 levels by about 8 percent and roughly 4.7 percent, respectively.\nIn a statement, Kevin Griffis, a spokesman for the Booker campaign, said in part: \"Mr. Lonegan is again using statistics misleadingly. Crime is down in Newark since Cory Booker took office.\"\nOur ruling\nIn a radio interview, Lonegan claimed that under Booker, Newark has seen \"violent crime up five years in a row, murder up five years in a row.\"\nThat statement is accurate in the sense that overall violent crime has increased over the past five years. But violent crime and murders have not gone up \"five years in a row,\" since there were decreases in some years.\nAlso, the increase in overall violent crime between 2007 and 2012 stems solely from a rise in robberies. The other violent crime categories in 2012, including murders, were below their 2007 levels.\nWe rate the statement Half True.\nTo comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.\nEditor's note: This story has been updated to clarify that overall violent crime has not increased in every year of Booker's tenure. During the five years cited by Lonegan, overall violent crime increased in three of those years.\u00a0 But overall violent crime was higher in 2012 than it was in 2007, Booker's first full year in office.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08959"}
