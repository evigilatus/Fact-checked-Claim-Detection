I never heard that before.\"\nQuintero replied: \"So you have a reusable bag, right? And then of course, people don\u2019t clean out these bags. So when you mix meat with vegetables and fruits and other goods, and you don\u2019t clean out that bag on a regular basis, then people are susceptible to foodborne illnesses.\"\nTake note: Health authorities recommend you wash bags regularly used to carry meats and vegetables.\nFor this fact check, we were curious about what happened when San Francisco banned plastic bags.\nQuintero cites professors\u2019 paper\nWe asked a foundation spokeswoman, Caroline Espinosa, to share the basis of Quintero\u2019s claim. By email, Espinosa pointed us to a November 2012 paper, \"Grocery Bag Bans and Foodborne Illness,\" by Jonathan Klick and Joshua Wright, law professors at the University of Pennsylvania and George Mason University, respectively.\nIn their write-up, posted by a University of Pennsylvania research center, the authors noted that San Francisco County barred large supermarkets and pharmacies from using \"non-compostable plastic checkout bags,\" effective Oct. 20, 2007. In 2012, the county\u2019s board of supervisors \"expanded the non-compostable plastic checkout bag ban to cover all retail and food establishments in\" the county, effective Oct. 1, 2012, the paper says, also requiring stores to charge at least a dime for any bag provided.\n\"To analyze emergency room visits,\" the authors wrote, \"we used the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development\u2019s Emergency Department and Ambulatory Surgery Data for each quarter from 2005-2010. These data provide the county of residence of each person admitted to a California ER, as well as the principal diagnosis for the individual using ICD-9 codes. Given the prevalence of coliform bacteria, especially E. coli, in reusable grocery bags, we focus on ER visits involving E. coli,\" the two said.\nAnd? The San Francisco bag ban is \"associated with a statistically significant and particularly large increase in ER visits for E. Coli infections. We find increases between one fourth and two thirds, suggesting an increase in visits between 72 and 191 annually,\" the paper said.\nAll told, the authors said, the bag ban there is \"associated with a 46 percent increase in deaths from foodborne illnesses. This implies an increase of 5.5 annual deaths for the county.\" On the other hand, the study\u2019s small sample size make \"any inferential claims\" tentative, the authors wrote.\nWe emailed and telephoned each professor and didn\u2019t hear back.\nSan Francisco County memo\nHunting perspective, we then ran the authors\u2019 names through the Nexis news database. That query led us to a March 2013 story posted by Texas-based D Magazine stating a San Francisco health officer had spelled out flaws in the professors\u2019 paper.\nThat story included a web link to a Feb. 8, 2013, memo from a San Francisco County health officer, Tom\u00e1s Aragon, to Eileen Shields, a county public health information officer. The memo said the county Department of Public Health had reviewed the professors\u2019 paper which, the officer noted, \"has not been submitted for rigorous scientific peer review and publication.\"\nGenerally, the memo states, \"Klick & Wright\u2019s conclusion that San Francisco\u2019s policy of banning of plastic bags has caused a significant increase in gastrointestinal bacterial infections and a \u201846 percent increase in the deaths from foodborne illnesses\u2019 is not warranted.\"\nOne weakness, the memo says, was that the professors presumed a link between reusable bags and a seeming spike in gastrointestinal bacterial infections--yet they failed to establish the link. \"Drawing causal conclusions from this type of study is called an \u2018ecological fallacy,\u2019\" the memo states. \"The basic study flaw is that persons that use reusable bags frequently may not be the same persons that were diagnosed with gastrointestinal bacterial infections in their study. This is the reason epidemiologists will not use ecological studies to test causal hypotheses. At best, ecologic studies raise epidemiologic causal hypotheses but cannot test them.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe memo continues: \"In testing causal hypotheses, it is necessary to measure the outcome (gastrointestinal infections) and exposure to the putative cause (reusable bags) in the same persons. Because of their study design, this was not possible.\"\nAlso, the memo says that in \"testing causal hypotheses, it is necessary to \u2018control for\u2019 alternative causal explanations (called \u2018confounders\u2019). Because of their study design, this was not possible. For example, gastrointestinal bacterial infections are not only caused from contaminated food, but also from contaminated water, improper food handling or preparation, or from person-to-person spread (such as sexual activity, especially in men who have sex with men). In any causal study, investigators always adjust for the \u2018usual suspects,\u2019\" the memo says.\nMoreover, the memo notes that the study\u2019s focus on illnesses identified in emergency rooms misses that people seek care at other places--or not at all--leaving the data incomplete. Alternatively, the memo says, laboratory-confirmed diagnoses reported to the health department are \"the proper basis for surveillance of microbiological data on these infections in our population.\"\nThe official went on to say there had been increases in some illnesses oft linked to food. Specifically, according to the memo, health department data show an increase in campylobacteriosis, one of the most common causes of diarrheal illness. Then again, the memo says, there was no detected increase in salmonellosis or enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, which is transmitted by food or water contaminated with animal or human feces.\n\"Interpreting these changes is not straightforward,\" the memo continues. \"The epidemiology of enteric pathogens in San Francisco differs compared to surrounding counties because we are an urban center with a larger population of ethnic immigrants and men who have sex with men (MSM),\" the memo states. \"Research studies need to adjust for these population differences.\"\nThe memo also disputes the professors\u2019 conclusions about deaths going up after the bag ban, mostly by declaring that 111 of the 140 San Francisco deaths from 2001 through 2010 figuring into the paper were attributed to Enterocolitis due to Clostridium difficile--an intestinal infection most commonly tied to exposure to antibiotics, particularly among hospitalized patients. \"Foodborne exposures is not yet an established cause of C. difficile enterocolitis, but is an active area of research,\" the memo says, going on to say the authors shouldn\u2019t have included C. difficile deaths in their analysis.\nSumming up, the memo says \"the idea that widespread use of reusable bags may cause gastrointestinal infections if they are not regularly cleaned is plausible. However, the hypothesis that there is a significant increase in gastrointestinal foodborne illnesses and deaths due to reusable bags has not been tested, much less demonstrated in this study. It would be a disservice to San Francisco residents and visitors to alarm them by claiming that it has been. It could be useful, however, to remind people to use safe food-handling practices, including maintaining the cleanliness of everything they use to transport, handle, and prepare food.\"\nWe asked San Francisco County if there had been any response by the professors to the county\u2019s memo. Nancy Sarieh of the public health department told us by email: \"They did respond. We agreed to disagree and they have not updated their paper.\"\nIn February 2013, we otherwise noticed, commentator Debra J. Saunders of the\u00a0San Francisco Chronicle quoted Klick saying he cannot \"rule out the possibility that there was something peculiar that happened in San Francisco.\"\nA Texas expert\nSeparately, we asked Dr. Philip Huang, the medical director for the Austin/Travis County Health and Human Services Department, to take a look at the paper posted by Penn plus the San Francisco County memo.\nHuang said by phone that the Penn paper, limited to ER admissions, missed the fact that individuals who take sick from food are treated by private doctors or don\u2019t even seek health care. Notably too, Huang said, the researchers failed to consider the health surveillance data later cited by the county.\n\"I mean, who knows? You can get a spike\" in illness \"and there could have been something else going on in the community that is totally unrelated,\" Huang said. \"I think the people who are closest to the data in their own community would have the best perspective.\" From ER admissions alone, Huang said, \"certainly the data is not there to make any conclusions about this.\"\nFoundation notes other accounts\nNext, we circled back to Espinosa, the foundation spokeswoman, about the memo disputing the professors\u2019 analysis and Huang\u2019s comments. By email, Espinosa pointed out a 2011 peer-reviewed study, partly supported by the American Chemistry Council, finding that among reusable bags randomly collected from consumers entering grocery stores in the San Francisco area, Los Angeles and Tucson, E. coli were identified in 8 percent of bags plus a \"wide range of enteric bacteria,\" according to the authors including Charles P. Gerba of the University of Arizona.\n\"When meat juices were added to bags and stored in the trunks of cars for two hours, the number of bacteria increased 10-fold, indicating the potential for bacterial growth in the bags,\" the authors wrote. \"Hand or machine washing was found to reduce the bacteria in bags by > 99.9%. These results indicate that reusable bags, if not properly washed on a regular basis, can play a role in the cross-contamination of foods. \"\nEspinosa also noted a May 2012 Los Angeles Times news story describing an Oregon outbreak affecting nine soccer players who had come in contact with a reused grocery bag. The story said one of the girls got sick shortly after arrival, from a norovirus she presumably acquired prior to the trip, Dr. Kimberly K. Repp of the Oregon Health and Science University and Dr. William E. Keene of the Oregon Public Health Division reported in the Journal of Infectious Diseases.\n\"The sick girl was then isolated in the room of one of the chaperones,\" the Times reported. \"Nonetheless, eight other girls became ill. The investigation showed that the virus was found on a reusable grocery bag that had been used to store snacks for the team. It had, unfortunately, been stored in the bathroom,\" the story said. When the sick girl used the bathroom, the norovirus was aerosolized and deposited on the bag, where it was later transferred to other girls when they got snacks.\nOur ruling\nQuintero said that when San Francisco banned plastic grocery bags, \"you saw the number of instances of people going to the ER with things like salmonella and other related illnesses\" spike.\nThis declaration relied on a study that took a correlation between ER cases and San Francisco\u2019s phased-in bag ban to declare ties between the reported illnesses and the ban. However, the county raised serious questions about the study methodology and conclusions, which were overly simplistic.\nWe rate this statement Mostly False.\n\nMOSTLY FALSE \u2013 The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.
