0001	COOPER	I'm Anderson Cooper.
0002	COOPER	Thanks for joining us.
0003	COOPER	We've already welcomed the candidates on stage.
0004	COOPER	They are in place at their podiums.
0005	COOPER	Before we dive into the issues, I want to quickly explain some of the groundrules tonight.
0006	COOPER	As the moderator, I'll ask questions, followups and guide the discussion.
0007	COOPER	I'll be joined in the questioning by CNN's Juan Carlos Lopez and Dana Bash, a well as Don Lemon who will share questions from Democrats around the country.
0008	COOPER	Each candidate will get one minute to answer questions, and 30 seconds for followups and rebuttals.
0009	COOPER	I'll give candidates time to respond if they have been singled out for criticism.
0010	COOPER	Our viewers should know that we have lights that are visible to the candidates to warn them when their time is up.
0011	COOPER	I want the candidates to be able to introduce themselves to our audience.
0012	COOPER	Each candidate will have two minutes to introduce themselves.
0013	COOPER	Let's begin with Governor Chafee.
0014	COOPER	Governor?
0015	CHAFEE	Thank you, Anderson.
0016	CHAFEE	Thank you, CNN, and thank you Facebook for organizing this debate.
0017	CHAFEE	Not only will Americans be electing a new president next year, we also will be electing a world leader.
0018	CHAFEE	Voters should assess the candidate's experience, character and vision for the future as they make this important decision.
0019	CHAFEE	I'm the only one running for president that has been a mayor, a United States senator, and a governor.
0020	CHAFEE	As mayor, I brought labor peace to my city and kept taxes down.
0021	CHAFEE	I was reelected three times.
0022	CHAFEE	As a senator, I earned a reputation for courageous votes against the BushCheney tax cuts the favored the wealthy, against the tragedy of the Iraq war, for environmental stewardship, for protection of our civil liberties.
0023	CHAFEE	I served on the Foreign Relations Committee and I chaired the Middle East Subcommittee for four years.
0024	CHAFEE	As governor, I came in at the depths of the recession and we turned my state around.
0025	CHAFEE	Rhode Island had the biggest drop of the unemployment rate over my four budgets of all but one state.
0026	CHAFEE	It happens to be Nevada, where we're having this debate.
0027	CHAFEE	I'm very proud that over my almost 30 years of public service, I have had no scandals.
0028	CHAFEE	I've always been honest.
0029	CHAFEE	I have the courage to take the longterm view, and I've shown good judgment.
0030	CHAFEE	I have high ethical standards.
0031	CHAFEE	As we look to the future, I want to address the income inequality, close the gap between the haves and the havenots.
0032	CHAFEE	I want to address climate change, a real threat to our planet.
0033	CHAFEE	And I believe in prosperity through peace.
0034	CHAFEE	I want to end these wars.
0035	CHAFEE	I look forward to the discussion ahead.
0036	CHAFEE	Thank you

0038	COOPER	Thank you very much, Governor.

0040	COOPER	Senator Webb, you have two minutes.
0041	WEBB	Thank you.
0042	WEBB	You know, people are disgusted with the way that money has corrupted our political process, intimidating incumbents and empowering Wall Street every day, the turnstile government that we see, and also the power of the financial sector in both parties.
0043	WEBB	They're looking for a leader who understands how the system works, who has not been coopted by it, and also has a proven record of accomplishing different things.
0044	WEBB	I have a record of working across the political aisle.
0045	WEBB	I've also spent more than half of my professional life away from politics in the independent world of being an author, a journalist, and a sole proprietor.
0046	WEBB	In government service, I've fought and bled for our country in Vietnam as a Marine.
0047	WEBB	I spent years as Assistant Secretary of Defense, Secretary of the Navy  in the Reagan administration.
0048	WEBB	In the senate, I spoke about economic fairness and social justice from day one.
0049	WEBB	I also wrote and passed the best piece of veterans education legislation in history, the Post 911 G.I.
0050	WEBB	Bill.
0051	WEBB	I brought criminal justice reform out of the political shadows and into the national discussion.
0052	WEBB	I led what later became called the Strategic Pivot to Asia two years before President Obama was elected.
0053	WEBB	I know where my loyalties are.
0054	WEBB	My mother grew up in the poverty of east Arkansas chopping cotton, picking strawberries.
0055	WEBB	Three of her seven siblings died in childhood.
0056	WEBB	My wife, Hong, came to this country as a refugee from war torn Vietnam  learned English, a language that was not spoken at home, and earned her way into Cornell Law School.
0057	WEBB	I have five daughters.
0058	WEBB	Amy works with disabled veterans, Sarah is an emergency room nurse, Julia is a massage therapist, Emily and Georgia are still in school.
0059	WEBB	My son Jim fought as an infantry Marine on the bloody streets of Ramadi.
0060	WEBB	You may be sure that in a Webb administration, the highest priority will be the working people who every day go out and make this country stronger at home, and who give us the right reputation and security overseas under a common sense foreign policy.
0061	SYSTEM	[ cheering and applause ]
0062	COOPER	Governor O'Malley, you have two minutes.
0063	O'MALLEY	My name is Martin O'Malley, former Mayor of Baltimore, former governor of Maryland, a life long democrat, and most importantly, a husband, and a father.
0064	O'MALLEY	My wife Katie and I have four great kids, Grace, and Tara, and William and Jack.
0065	O'MALLEY	And, like you, there is nothing we wouldn't do to give them healthier and better lives.
0066	O'MALLEY	There are some things that I have learned to do better in life than others.
0067	O'MALLEY	And, after 15 years of executive experience, I have learned how to be an effective leader.
0068	O'MALLEY	Whether it was raising the minimum wage, making our public schools the best in America, passing marriage equality, the DREAM Act, and comprehensive gun safety legislation, I have learned how to get things done because I am very clear about my principals.
0069	O'MALLEY	Thanks to President Obama, our country has come a long way since the Wall Street crash of 2008.
0070	O'MALLEY	Our country's doing better, we are creating jobs again.
0071	O'MALLEY	But we elected a president, not a magician, and there is urgent work that needs to be done right now.
0072	O'MALLEY	For there is a  deep injustice, an economic injustice that threatens to tear our country apart, and it will not solve itself.
0073	O'MALLEY	Injustice does not solve itself.
0074	O'MALLEY	What I'm talking about is this, our middle class is shrinking.
0075	O'MALLEY	Our poor families are becoming poorer, and 70 percent of us are earning the same, or less than we were 12 years ago.
0076	O'MALLEY	We need new leadership, and we need action.
0077	O'MALLEY	The sort of action that will actually make wages go up again for all American families.
0078	O'MALLEY	Our economy isn't money, it's people.
0079	O'MALLEY	It's all of our people, and so we must invest in our country, and the potential of our kids to make college a debt free option for all of our families, instead of settling our kids with a lifetime of crushing debt.
0080	O'MALLEY	And, we must square our shoulders to the great challenge of climate change and make this threat our opportunity.
0081	O'MALLEY	The future is what we make of it.
0082	O'MALLEY	We are all in this together.
0083	O'MALLEY	And, the question in this election is whether you and I still have the ability to give our kids a better future.
0084	O'MALLEY	I believe we do, that is why I am running for president, and I need your help.
0085	O'MALLEY	Thank you.
0086	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0087	COOPER	Governor O'Malley, thank you very much.
0088	COOPER	Senator Sanders.
0089	SANDERS	Anderson, thank you very much.
0090	SANDERS	I think most Americans understand that our country today faces a series of unprecedented crises.
0091	SANDERS	The middle class of this country for the last 40 years has been disappearing.
0092	SANDERS	Millions of Americans are working longer hours for lower wages, and yet almost all of the new income and wealth being created is going to the top one percent.
0093	SANDERS	As a result of this disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision, our campaign finance system is corrupt and is undermining American democracy.
0094	SANDERS	Millionaires and billionaires are pouring unbelievable sums of money into the political process in order to fund super PACs and to elect candidates who represent their interests, not the interests of working people.
0095	SANDERS	Today, the scientific community is virtually unanimous climate change is real, it is caused by human activity, and we have a moral responsibility to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy and leave this planet a habitable planet for our children and our grandchildren.
0096	SANDERS	Today in America, we have more people in jail than any other country on Earth.
0097	SANDERS	AfricanAmerican youth unemployment is 51 percent.
0098	SANDERS	Hispanic youth unemployment is 36 percent.
0099	SANDERS	It seems to me that instead of building more jails and providing more incarceration, maybe  just maybe  we should be putting money into education and jobs for our kids.
0100	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0101	SANDERS	What this campaign is about is whether we can mobilize our people to take back our government from a handful of billionaires and create the vibrant democracy we know we can and should have.
0102	SANDERS	Thank you.
0103	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0104	COOPER	Secretary Clinton?
0105	CLINTON	Well, thank you, and thanks to everyone for hosting this first of the Democratic debates.
0106	CLINTON	I'm Hillary Clinton.
0107	CLINTON	I have been proud and privileged to serve as first lady, as a senator from New York, and as secretary of state.
0108	CLINTON	I'm the granddaughter of a factory worker and the grandmother of a wonderful oneyearold child.
0109	CLINTON	And every day, I think about what we need to do to make sure that opportunity is available not just for her, but for all of our children.
0110	CLINTON	I have spent a very long time  my entire adult life  looking for ways to even the odds to help people have a chance to get ahead, and, in particular, to find the ways for each child to live up to his or her Godgiven potential.
0111	CLINTON	I've traveled across our country over the last months listening and learning, and I've put forward specific plans about how we're going to create more goodpaying jobs by investing in infrastructure and clean energy, by making it possible once again to invest in science and research, and taking the opportunity posed by climate change to grow our economy.
0112	CLINTON	At the center of my campaign is how we're going to raise wages.
0113	CLINTON	Yes, of course, raise the minimum wage, but we have to do so much more, including finding ways so that companies share profits with the workers who helped to make them.
0114	CLINTON	And then we have to figure out how we're going to make the tax system a fairer one.
0115	CLINTON	Right now, the wealthy pay too little and the middle class pays too much.
0116	CLINTON	So I have specific recommendations about how we're going to close those loopholes, make it clear that the wealthy will have to pay their fair share, and have a series of tax cuts for middleclass families.
0117	CLINTON	And I want to do more to help us balance family and work.
0118	CLINTON	I believe in equal pay for equal work for women, but I also believe it's about time we had paid family leave for American families and join the rest of the world.
0119	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0120	CLINTON	During the course of the evening tonight, I'll have a chance to lay out all of my plans and the work that I've done behind them.
0121	CLINTON	But for me, this is about bringing our country together again.
0122	CLINTON	And I will do everything I can to heal the divides  the divides economically, because there's too much inequality the racial divides the continuing discrimination against the LGBT community  so that we work together and, yes, finally, fathers will be able to say to their daughters, you, too, can grow up to be president.
0123	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0124	COOPER	Thank you, all.
0125	COOPER	It is time to start the debate.
0126	COOPER	Are you all ready?
0127	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0128	COOPER	All right.
0129	COOPER	Let's begin.
0130	COOPER	We're going to be discussing a lot of the issues, many of the issues, important issues that you have brought up.
0131	COOPER	But I want to begin with concerns that voters have about each of the candidates here on this stage that they have about each of you.
0132	COOPER	Secretary Clinton, I want to start with you.
0133	COOPER	Plenty of politicians evolve on issues, but even some Democrats believe you change your positions based on political expediency.
0134	COOPER	You were against samesex marriage.
0135	COOPER	Now you're for it.
0136	COOPER	You defended President Obama's immigration policies.
0137	COOPER	Now you say they're too harsh.
0138	COOPER	You supported his trade deal dozen of times.
0139	COOPER	You even called it the "gold standard".
0140	COOPER	Now, suddenly, last week, you're against it.
0141	COOPER	Will you say anything to get elected?
0142	CLINTON	Well, actually, I have been very consistent.
0143	CLINTON	Over the course of my entire life, I have always fought for the same values and principles, but, like most human beings  including those of us who run for office  I do absorb new information.
0144	CLINTON	I do look at what's happening in the world.
0145	CLINTON	You know, take the trade deal.
0146	CLINTON	I did say, when I was secretary of state, three years ago, that I hoped it would be the gold standard.
0147	CLINTON	It was just finally negotiated last week, and in looking at it, it didn't meet my standards.
0148	CLINTON	My standards for more new, good jobs for Americans, for raising wages for Americans.
0149	CLINTON	And I want to make sure that I can look into the eyes of any middleclass American and say, "this will help raise your wages."
0150	CLINTON	And I concluded I could not.
0151	COOPER	Secretary Clinton, though, with all due respect, the question is really about political expediency.
0152	COOPER	Just in July, New Hampshire, you told the crowd you'd, quote, "take a back seat to no one when it comes to progressive values."
0153	COOPER	Last month in Ohio, you said you plead guilty to, quote, "being kind of moderate and center."
0154	COOPER	Do you change your political identity based on who you're talking to?
0155	CLINTON	No.
0156	CLINTON	I think that, like most people that I know, I have a range of views, but they are rooted in my values and my experience.
0157	CLINTON	And I don't take a back seat to anyone when it comes to progressive experience and progressive commitment.
0158	CLINTON	You know, when I left law school, my first job was with the Children's Defense Fund, and for all the years since, I have been focused on how we're going to unstack the deck, and how we're gonna make it possible for more people to have the experience I had.
0159	CLINTON	You know, to be able to come from a grandfather who was a factory worker, a father who was a small business person, and now asking the people of America to elect me president.
0160	COOPER	Just for the record, are you a progressive, or are you a moderate?
0161	CLINTON	I'm a progressive.
0162	CLINTON	But I'm a progressive who likes to get things done.
0163	CLINTON	And I know...
0164	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0165	CLINTON	...how to find common ground, and I know how to stand my ground, and I have proved that in every position that I've had, even dealing with Republicans who never had a good word to say about me, honestly.
0166	CLINTON	But we found ways to work together on everything from...
0167	COOPER	Secretary...
0168	CLINTON	...reforming foster care and adoption to the Children's Health Insurance Program, which insures...
0169	COOPER	...thank you...
0170	CLINTON	...8 million kids.
0171	CLINTON	So I have a long history of getting things done, rooted in the same values...
0172	COOPER	...Senator...
0173	CLINTON	...I've always had.
0174	COOPER	Senator Sanders.
0175	COOPER	A Gallup poll says half the country would not put a socialist in the White House.
0176	COOPER	You call yourself a democratic socialist.
0177	COOPER	How can any kind of socialist win a general election in the United States?
0178	SANDERS	Well, we're gonna win because first, we're gonna explain what democratic socialism is.
0179	SANDERS	And what democratic socialism is about is saying that it is immoral and wrong that the top onetenth of 1 percent in this country own almost 90 percent  almost  own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent.
0180	SANDERS	That it is wrong, today, in a rigged economy, that 57 percent of all new income is going to the top 1 percent.
0181	SANDERS	That when you look around the world, you see every other major country providing health care to all people as a right, except the United States.
0182	SANDERS	You see every other major country saying to moms that, when you have a baby, we're not gonna separate you from your newborn baby, because we are going to have  we are gonna have medical and family paid leave, like every other country on Earth.
0183	SANDERS	Those are some of the principles that I believe in, and I think we should look to countries like Denmark, like Sweden and Norway, and learn from what they have accomplished for their working people.
0184	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0185	COOPER	Denmark is a country that has a population  Denmark is a country that has a population of 5.6 million people.
0186	COOPER	The question is really about electability here, and that's what I'm trying to get at.
0187	COOPER	You  the  the Republican attack ad against you in a general election  it writes itself.
0188	COOPER	You supported the Sandinistas in Nicaragua.
0189	COOPER	You honeymooned in the Soviet Union.
0190	COOPER	And just this weekend, you said you're not a capitalist.
0191	COOPER	Doesn't  doesn't that ad write itself?
0192	SANDERS	Well, first of all, let's look at the facts.
0193	SANDERS	The facts that are very simple.
0194	SANDERS	Republicans win when there is a low voter turnout, and that is what happened last November.
0195	SANDERS	Sixtythree percent of the American people didn't vote, Anderson.
0196	SANDERS	Eighty percent of young people didn't vote.
0197	SANDERS	We are bringing out huge turnouts, and creating excitement all over this country.
0198	SANDERS	Democrats at the White House on down will win, when there is excitement and a large voter turnout, and that is what this campaign is doing.
0199	COOPER	You don't consider yourself a capitalist, though?
0200	SANDERS	Do I consider myself part of the casino capitalist process by which so few have so much and so many have so little by which Wall Street's greed and recklessness wrecked this economy?
0201	SANDERS	No, I don't.
0202	SANDERS	I believe in a society where all people do well.
0203	SANDERS	Not just a handful of billionaires.
0204	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0205	COOPER	Just let me just be clear.
0206	COOPER	Is there anybody else on the stage who is not a capitalist?
0207	CLINTON	Well, let me just followup on that, Anderson, because when I think about capitalism, I think about all the small businesses that were started because we have the opportunity and the freedom in our country for people to do that and to make a good living for themselves and their families.
0208	CLINTON	And I don't think we should confuse what we have to do every so often in America, which is save capitalism from itself.
0209	CLINTON	And I think what Senator Sanders is saying certainly makes sense in the terms of the inequality that we have.
0210	CLINTON	But we are not Denmark.
0211	CLINTON	I love Denmark.
0212	CLINTON	We are the United States of America.
0213	CLINTON	And it's our job to rein in the excesses of capitalism so that it doesn't run amok and doesn't cause the kind of inequities we're seeing in our economic system.
0214	CLINTON	But we would be making a grave mistake to turn our backs on what built the greatest middle class in the history...
0215	COOPER	Senator Sanders?
0216	CLINTON	... of the world.
0217	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0218	SANDERS	I think everybody is in agreement that we are a great entrepreneurial nation.
0219	SANDERS	We have got to encourage that.
0220	SANDERS	Of course, we have to support small and mediumsized businesses.
0221	SANDERS	But you can have all of the growth that you want and it doesn't mean anything if all of the new income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent.
0222	SANDERS	So what we need to do is support small and mediumsized businesses, the backbone of our economy, but we have to make sure that every family in this country gets a fair shake...
0223	COOPER	We're going to get...
0224	SANDERS	... not just for billionaires.
0225	COOPER	We're going to have a lot more on these issues.
0226	COOPER	But I do want to just quickly get everybody in on the question of electability.
0227	COOPER	Governor Chafee, you've been everything but a socialist.
0228	COOPER	When you were senator from Rhode Island, you were a Republican.
0229	COOPER	When you were elected governor, you were an independent.
0230	COOPER	You've only been a Democrat for little more than two years.
0231	COOPER	Why should Democratic voters trust you won't change again?
0232	CHAFEE	Anderson, you're looking at a block of granite when it comes to the issues.
0233	CHAFEE	Whether it's...
0234	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
0235	COOPER	It seems like pretty soft granite.
0236	COOPER	I mean, you've been a Republican, you've been an independent.
0237	CHAFEE	Did you hear what I said?
0238	CHAFEE	On the issues.
0239	CHAFEE	I have not changed on the issues.
0240	CHAFEE	I was a liberal Republican, then I was an independent, and now I'm a proud Democrat.
0241	CHAFEE	But I have not changed on the issues.
0242	CHAFEE	And I open my record to scrutiny.
0243	CHAFEE	Whether it's on the environment, a woman's right to choose, gay marriage, fiscal responsibility, aversion to foreign entanglements, using the tools of government to help the less fortunate.
0244	CHAFEE	Time and time again, I have never changed.
0245	CHAFEE	You're looking at a block of granite when it comes to the issues.
0246	CHAFEE	So I have not changed.
0247	COOPER	Then why change labels?
0248	CHAFEE	The party left me.
0249	CHAFEE	There's no doubt about that.
0250	CHAFEE	There was no room for a liberal moderate Republican in that party.
0251	CHAFEE	I even had a primary for my reelection in 2006.
0252	CHAFEE	I won it.
0253	CHAFEE	But the money poured in to defeat me in Rhode Island as a Republican.
0254	CHAFEE	That's what we were up against.
0255	COOPER	Governor O'Malley, the concern of voters about you is that you tout our record as Baltimore's mayor.
0256	COOPER	As we all know, we all saw it.
0257	COOPER	That city exploded in riots and violence in April.
0258	COOPER	The current top prosecutor in Baltimore, also a Democrat, blames your zero tolerance policies for sowing the seeds of unrest.
0259	COOPER	Why should Americans trust you with the country when they see what's going on in the city that you ran for more than seven years?
0260	O'MALLEY	Yes, actually, I believe what she said was that there's a lot of policies that have led to this unrest.
0261	O'MALLEY	But, Anderson, when I ran for mayor of Baltimore in 1999...
0262	COOPER	She actually  just for the record, when she was asked which policies, to name two, she said zero tolerance.
0263	COOPER	I mean, there's a number of old policies that we're seeing the results of.
0264	COOPER	That distress of communities, where communities don't want to step forward and say who killed a 3yearold, it's a direct result of these failed policies.
0265	O'MALLEY	Well, let's talk about this a little bit.
0266	O'MALLEY	One of the things that was not reported during that heartbreaking night of unrest in Baltimore was that arrests had actually fallen to a 38year low in the year prior to the Freddie Gray's tragic death.
0267	O'MALLEY	Anderson, when I ran for mayor of Baltimore back in 1999, it was not because our city was doing well.
0268	O'MALLEY	It was because we allowed ourselves to become the most violent, addicted, and abandoned city in America.
0269	O'MALLEY	And I ran and promised people that together we could turn that around.
0270	O'MALLEY	And we put our city on a path to reduce violent crime, or part one (ph) crime by more than any other major city in America over the next 10 years.
0271	O'MALLEY	I did not make our city immune to setbacks.
0272	O'MALLEY	But I attended a lot of funerals, including one for a family of seven who were firebombed in their sleep for picking up the phone in a poor AfricanAmerican neighborhood and calling the police because of drug dealers on their corner.
0273	O'MALLEY	We've saved over a thousand lives in Baltimore in the last 15 years of people working together.
0274	O'MALLEY	And the vast majority of them were young and poor and black.
0275	O'MALLEY	It wasn't easy on any day.
0276	O'MALLEY	But we saved lives and we gave our city a better future, improving police and community relations every single day that I was in office.
0277	COOPER	In one year alone, though, 100,000 arrests were made in your city, a city of 640,000 people.
0278	COOPER	The ACLU, the NAACP sued you, sued the city, and the city actually settled, saying a lot of those arrests were without probable cause.
0279	O'MALLEY	Well, I think the key word in your followup there was the word "settle."
0280	O'MALLEY	That's true.
0281	O'MALLEY	It was settled.
0282	O'MALLEY	Arrests peaked in 2003, Anderson, but they declined every year after that as we restored peace in our poorer neighborhoods so that people could actually walk and not have to worry about their kids or their loved ones of being victims of violent crime.
0283	O'MALLEY	Look, none of this is easy.
0284	O'MALLEY	None of us has all the answers.
0285	O'MALLEY	But together as a city, we saved a lot of lives.
0286	O'MALLEY	It was about leadership.
0287	O'MALLEY	It was about principle.
0288	O'MALLEY	And it was about bringing people together.
0289	COOPER	Thank you, Governor.
0290	O'MALLEY	Thank you.
0291	COOPER	Senator Webb, in 2006, you called affirmative action "statesponsored racism."
0292	COOPER	In 2010, you wrote an oped saying it discriminates against whites.
0293	COOPER	Given that nearly half the Democratic Party is nonwhite, aren't you out of step with where the Democratic Party is now?
0294	WEBB	No, actually I believe that I am where the Democratic Party traditionally has been.
0295	WEBB	The Democratic Party, and the reason I've decided to run as a Democrat, has been the party that gives people who otherwise have no voice in the corridors of power a voice.
0296	WEBB	And that is not determined by race.
0297	WEBB	And as a clarification, I have always supported affirmative action for African Americans.
0298	WEBB	That's the way the program was originally designed because of their unique history in this country, with slavery and the Jim Crow laws that followed.
0299	WEBB	What I have discussed a number of times is the idea that when we create diversity programs that include everyone, quote, "of color," other than whites, struggling whites like the families in the Appalachian mountains, we're not being true to the Democratic Party principle of elevating the level of consciousness among our people about the hardships that a lot of people who happen to be have  by culture, by the way.
0300	COOPER	Senator Webb, thank you very much.
0301	COOPER	Let's move on to some of the most pressing issues facing our country right now, some of the biggest issues right now in the headlines today.
0302	COOPER	We're going to start with guns.
0303	COOPER	The shooting in Oregon earlier this month, once again it brought the issue of guns into the national conversation.
0304	COOPER	Over the last week, guns have been the most discussed political topic on Facebook by two to one.
0305	COOPER	Senator Sanders, you voted against the Brady bill that mandated background checks and a waiting period.
0306	COOPER	You also supported allowing riders to bring guns in checked bags on Amtrak trains.
0307	COOPER	For a decade, you said that holding gun manufacturers legally responsible for mass shootings is a bad idea.
0308	COOPER	Now, you say you're reconsidering that.
0309	COOPER	Which is it shield the gun companies from lawsuits or not?
0310	SANDERS	Let's begin, Anderson, by understanding that Bernie Sanders has a Dminus voting rating (ph) from the NRA.
0311	SANDERS	Let's also understand that back in 1988 when I first ran for the United States Congress, way back then, I told the gun owners of the state of Vermont and I told the people of the state of Vermont, a state which has virtually no gun control, that I supported a ban on assault weapons.
0312	SANDERS	And over the years, I have strongly avoided instant background checks, doing away with this terrible gun show loophole.
0313	SANDERS	And I think we've got to move aggressively at the federal level in dealing with the straw man purchasers.
0314	SANDERS	Also I believe, and I've fought for, to understand that there are thousands of people in this country today who are suicidal, who are homicidal, but can't get the healthcare that they need, the mental healthcare, because they don't have insurance or they're too poor.
0315	SANDERS	I believe that everybody in this country who has a mental crisis has got to get mental health counseling immediately.
0316	COOPER	Do you want to shield gun companies from lawsuits?
0317	SANDERS	Of course not.
0318	SANDERS	This was a large and complicated bill.
0319	SANDERS	There were provisions in it that I think made sense.
0320	SANDERS	For example, do I think that a gun shop in the state of Vermont that sells legally a gun to somebody, and that somebody goes out and does something crazy, that that gun shop owner should be held responsible?
0321	SANDERS	I don't.
0322	SANDERS	On the other hand, where you have manufacturers and where you have gun shops knowingly giving guns to criminals or aiding and abetting that, of course we should take action.
0323	COOPER	Secretary Clinton, is Bernie Sanders tough enough on guns?
0324	CLINTON	No, not at all.
0325	CLINTON	I think that we have to look at the fact that we lose 90 people a day from gun violence.
0326	CLINTON	This has gone on too long and it's time the entire country stood up against the NRA.
0327	CLINTON	The majority of our country...
0328	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0329	CLINTON	... supports background checks, and even the majority of gun owners do.
0330	CLINTON	Senator Sanders did vote five times against the Brady bill.
0331	CLINTON	Since it was passed, more than 2 million prohibited purchases have been prevented.
0332	CLINTON	He also did vote, as he said, for this immunity provision.
0333	CLINTON	I voted against it.
0334	CLINTON	I was in the Senate at the same time.
0335	CLINTON	It wasn't that complicated to me.
0336	CLINTON	It was pretty straightforward to me that he was going to give immunity to the only industry in America.
0337	CLINTON	Everybody else has to be accountable, but not the gun manufacturers.
0338	CLINTON	And we need to stand up and say Enough of that.
0339	CLINTON	We're not going to let it continue.
0340	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0341	COOPER	We're going to bring you all in on this.
0342	COOPER	But, Senator Sanders, you have to give a response.
0343	SANDERS	As a senator from a rural state, what I can tell Secretary Clinton, that all the shouting in the world is not going to do what I would hope all of us want, and that is keep guns out of the hands of people who should not have those guns and end this horrible violence that we are seeing.
0344	SANDERS	I believe that there is a consensus in this country.
0345	SANDERS	A consensus has said we need to strengthen and expand instant background checks, do away with this gun show loophole, that we have to address the issue of mental health, that we have to deal with the strawman purchasing issue, and that when we develop that consensus, we can finally, finally do something to address this issue.
0346	COOPER	Governor O'Malley, you passed gun legislation as governor of Maryland, but you had a Democraticcontrolled legislature.
0347	COOPER	President Obama couldn't convince Congress to pass gun legislation after the massacres in Aurora, in Newtown, and Charleston.
0348	COOPER	How can you?
0349	O'MALLEY	And, Anderson, I also had to overcome a lot of opposition in the leadership of my own party to get this done.
0350	O'MALLEY	Look, it's fine to talk about all of these things  and I'm glad we're talking about these things  but I've actually done them.
0351	O'MALLEY	We passed comprehensive gun safety legislation, not by looking at the pollings or looking at what the polls said.
0352	O'MALLEY	We actually did it.
0353	O'MALLEY	And, Anderson, here tonight in our audience are two people that make this issue very, very real.
0354	O'MALLEY	Sandy and Lonnie Phillips are here from Colorado.
0355	O'MALLEY	And their daughter, Jessie, was one of those who lost their lives in that awful mass shooting in Aurora.
0356	O'MALLEY	Now, to try to transform their grief, they went to court, where sometimes progress does happen when you file in court, but in this case, you want to talk about a  a rigged game, Senator?
0357	O'MALLEY	The game was rigged.
0358	O'MALLEY	A man had sold 4,000 rounds of military ammunition to this  this person that killed their daughter, riddled her body with five bullets, and he didn't even ask where it was going.
0359	O'MALLEY	And not only did their case get thrown out of court, they were slapped with $200,000 in court fees because of the way that the NRA gets its way in our Congress and we take a backseat.
0360	O'MALLEY	It's time to stand up and pass comprehensive gun safety legislation as a nation.
0361	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0362	COOPER	Senator Sanders, I want you to be able to respond, 30 seconds.
0363	SANDERS	I think the governor gave a very good example about the weaknesses in that law and I think we have to take another look at it.
0364	SANDERS	But here is the point, Governor.
0365	SANDERS	We can raise our voices, but I come from a rural state, and the views on gun control in rural states are different than in urban states, whether we like it or not.
0366	SANDERS	Our job is to bring people together around strong, commonsense gun legislation.
0367	SANDERS	I think there is a vast majority in this country who want to do the right thing, and I intend to lead the country in bringing our people together.
0368	O'MALLEY	Senator  Senator, excuse me.
0369	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
0370	O'MALLEY	Senator, it is not about rural  Senator, it was not about rural and urban.
0371	SANDERS	It's exactly about rural.
0372	O'MALLEY	Have you ever been to the Eastern Shore?
0373	O'MALLEY	Have you ever been to Western Maryland?
0374	O'MALLEY	We were able to pass this and still respect the hunting traditions of people who live in our rural areas.
0375	SANDERS	Governor...
0376	O'MALLEY	And we did it by leading with principle, not by pandering to the NRA and backing down to the NRA.
0377	SANDERS	Well, as somebody who has a Dminus voting record...
0378	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
0379	O'MALLEY	And I have an F from the NRA, Senator.
0380	SANDERS	I don't think I am pandering.
0381	SANDERS	But you have not been in the United States Congress.
0382	O'MALLEY	Well, maybe that's a healthy thing.
0383	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
0384	SANDERS	And when you want to, check it out.
0385	SANDERS	And if you think  if you think that we can simply go forward and pass something tomorrow without bringing people together, you are sorely mistaken.
0386	COOPER	Let me bring in somebody who has a different viewpoint.
0387	COOPER	Senator Webb, your rating from the NRA, you once had an A rating from the NRA.
0388	COOPER	You've said gun violence goes down when more people are allowed to carry guns.
0389	COOPER	Would encouraging more people to be armed be part of your response to a mass shooting?
0390	WEBB	Look, there are two fundamental issues that are involved in this discussion.
0391	WEBB	We need to pay respect to both of them.
0392	WEBB	The first is the issue of who should be kept from having guns and using firearms.
0393	WEBB	And we have done not a good job on that.
0394	WEBB	A lot of them are criminals.
0395	WEBB	And a lot of the people are getting killed are members of gangs inside our urban areas.
0396	WEBB	And a lot of them are mentally incapacitated.
0397	WEBB	And the shooting in Virginia Tech in '07, this individual had received medical care for mental illness from three different professionals who were not allowed to share the information.
0398	WEBB	So we do need background checks.
0399	WEBB	We need to keep the people who should not have guns away from them.
0400	WEBB	But we have to respect the tradition in this country of people who want to defend themselves and their family from violence.
0401	COOPER	Senator...
0402	WEBB	May I?
0403	WEBB	People are going back and forth here for 10 minutes here.
0404	WEBB	There are people at high levels in this government who have bodyguards 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
0405	WEBB	The average American does not have that, and deserves the right to be able to protect their family.
0406	COOPER	Senator  Governor Chafee, you have an F rating from the NRA, what do you think about what Senator Webb just said?
0407	CHAFEE	Yes, I have a good record of voting for gun commonsense safety legislation, but the reality is, despite these tragedies that happen time and time again, when legislators step up to pass commonsense gun safety legislation, the gun lobby moves in and tells the people they're coming to take away your guns.
0408	CHAFEE	And, they're successful at it, in Colorado and others states, the legislators that vote for commonsense gun safety measures then get defeated.
0409	CHAFEE	I even saw in Rhode Island.
0410	CHAFEE	So, I would bring the gun lobby in and say we've got to change this.
0411	CHAFEE	Where can we find common ground?
0412	CHAFEE	Wayne Lapierre from the NRA, whoever it is, the leaders.
0413	CHAFEE	Come one, we've go to change this.
0414	CHAFEE	We're not coming to take away your guns, we believe in the Second Amendment, but let's find common ground here.
0415	COOPER	I want to...
0416	O'MALLEY	...Anderson, when the NRA wrote to everyone in our state  when the NRA wrote to members in our state and told people with hunting traditions lies about what our comprehensive gun safety legislation is, I wrote right back to them and laid out what it actually did.
0417	O'MALLEY	And that's why, not only did we pass it, but the NRA didn't...
0418	SANDERS	...Excuse me...
0419	O'MALLEY	...dare to petition a referendum...
0420	SANDERS	...I want to make...
0421	O'MALLEY	...Because we built a public consensus...
0422	COOPER	...I want to move on to another issue, which is in the headlines right now, another crisis making headlines.
0423	COOPER	Secretary Clinton, Russia, they're challenging the U.S. in Syria.
0424	COOPER	According to U.S. intelligence, they've lied about who they're bombing.
0425	COOPER	You spearheaded the reset with Russia.
0426	COOPER	Did you underestimate the Russians, and as president, what would your response to Vladimir Putin be right now in Syria?
0427	CLINTON	Well, first of all, we got a lot of business done with the Russians when Medvedev was the president, and not Putin.
0428	CLINTON	We got a nuclear arms deal, we got the Iranian sanctions, we got an ability to bring important material and equipment to our soldiers in Afghanistan.
0429	CLINTON	There's no doubt that when Putin came back in and said he was going to be President, that did change the relationship.
0430	CLINTON	We have to stand up to his bullying, and specifically in Syria, it is important  and I applaud the administration because they are engaged in talks right now with the Russians to make it clear that they've got to be part of the solution to try to end that bloody conflict.
0431	CLINTON	And, to  provide safe zones so that people are not going to have to be flooding out of Syria at the rate they are.
0432	CLINTON	And, I think it's important too that the United States make it very clear to Putin that it's not acceptable for him to be in Syria creating more chaos, bombing people on behalf of Assad, and we can't do that if we don't take more of a leadership position, which is what I'm advocating.
0433	COOPER	Senator Sanders, what would you do differently.
0434	SANDERS	Well, let's understand that when we talk about Syria, you're talking about a quagmire in a quagmire.
0435	SANDERS	You're talking about groups of people trying to overthrow Assad, other groups of people fighting ISIS.
0436	SANDERS	You're talking about people who are fighting ISIS using their guns to overthrow Assad, and vice versa.
0437	SANDERS	I'm the former chairman of the Senate Veterans Committee, and in that capacity I learned a very powerful lesson about the cost of war, and I will do everything that I can to make sure that the United States does not get involved in another quagmire like we did in Iraq, the worst foreign policy blunder in the history of this country.
0438	SANDERS	We should be putting together a coalition of Arab countries who should be leading the effort.
0439	SANDERS	We should be supportive, but I do not support American ground troops in Syria.
0440	COOPER	On this issue of foreign policy, I want to go to...
0441	CLINTON	...Well, nobody does.
0442	CLINTON	Nobody does, Senator Sanders.
0443	COOPER	I want to go to Dana Bash.
0444	COOPER	Dana?
0445	BASH	Governor Chafee, you were the only Republican in the Senate to vote against the Iraq war.
0446	BASH	You say Secretary Clinton should be disqualified from the presidency because she voted in favor of using force in Iraq.
0447	BASH	She has since said that her vote was a mistake.
0448	BASH	Why isn't that good enough?
0449	CHAFEE	Well, we just heard Senator Sanders say that it's the worst decision in American history.
0450	CHAFEE	That's very significant, the worst decision in American history, I just heard from Senator Sanders.
0451	CHAFEE	So, as we look ahead, if you're going to make those poor judgment calls, a critical time in our history, we just finished with the Vietnam era, getting back into another quagmire  if you're looking ahead, and you're looking at someone who made that poor decision in 2002 to go into Iraq when there was no real evidence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq  I know because I did my homework, and, so, that's an indication of how someone will perform in the future.
0452	CHAFEE	And that's what's important.
0453	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0454	BASH	Secretary Clinton, he's questioning your judgment.
0455	CLINTON	Well, I recall very well being on a debate stage, I think, about 25 times with then Senator Obama, debating this very issue.
0456	CLINTON	After the election, he asked me to become Secretary of State.
0457	CLINTON	He valued my judgment, and I spent a lot of time with him...
0458	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0459	CLINTON	...in the Situation Room, going over some very difficult issues.
0460	CLINTON	You know, I  I agree completely.
0461	CLINTON	We don't want American troops on the ground in Syria.
0462	CLINTON	I never said that.
0463	CLINTON	What I said was we had to put together a coalition  in fact, something that I worked on before I left the State Department  to do, and yes, that it should include Arabs, people in the region.
0464	CLINTON	Because what I worry about is what will happen with ISIS gaining more territory, having more reach, and, frankly, posing a threat to our friends and neighbors in the region and far beyond.
0465	CLINTON	So I think while you're talking about the tough decision that President Obama had to make about Osama bin Laden, where I was one of his few advisers, or putting together that coalition to impose sanctions on Iran  I think I have a lot of evidence...
0466	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
0467	BASH	Senator Sanders  Senator Sanders, I want to bring you in here.
0468	BASH	My question for you is, as a congressman, you voted against the Iraq War.
0469	BASH	You voted against the Gulf War.
0470	BASH	You're just talking about Syria, but under what circumstances would a President Sanders actually use force?
0471	SANDERS	Let me just respond to something the secretary said.
0472	SANDERS	First of all, she is talking about, as I understand it, a nofly zone in Syria, which I think is a very dangerous situation.
0473	SANDERS	Could lead to real problems.
0474	SANDERS	Second of all, I heard the same evidence from President Bush and Dick Cheney and Don Rumsfeld about why we should overthrow Saddam Hussein and get involved in the  I would urge people to go to berniesanders.com, hear what I said in 2002.
0475	SANDERS	And I say, without any joy in my heart, that much of what I thought would happen about the destabilization, in fact, did happen.
0476	SANDERS	So I think...
0477	BASH	All right.
0478	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0479	SANDERS	I think the president is trying very hard to thread a tough needle here, and that is to support those people who are against Assad, against ISIS, without getting us on the ground there, and that's the direction I believe we should have (inaudible).
0480	COOPER	But, Senator Sanders, you didn't answer the question.
0481	COOPER	Under what  under what circumstances would you actually use force?
0482	SANDERS	Well, obviously, I voted, when President Clinton said, "let's stop ethnic cleansing in Kosovo," I voted for that.
0483	SANDERS	I voted to make sure that Osama bin Laden was held accountable in Afghanistan.
0484	SANDERS	When our country is threatened, or when our allies are threatened, I believe that we need coalitions to come together to address the major crises of this country.
0485	SANDERS	I do not support the United States getting involved in unilateral action.
0486	UNKNOWN	You're at work with our allies.
0487	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
0488	COOPER	I'm gonna bring you all in on this.
0489	COOPER	Governor  Governor O'Malley, Secretary Clinton...
0490	SANDERS	I don't believe that any...
0491	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
0492	COOPER	Secretary Clinton voted to authorize military force in Iraq, supported more troops in Afghanistan.
0493	COOPER	As Secretary of State, she wanted to arm Syrian rebels and push for the bombing of Libya.
0494	COOPER	Is she too quick to use military force?
0495	O'MALLEY	Anderson, no president  no commander in chief  should take the military option off the table, even if most of us would agree that it should be the last option.
0496	O'MALLEY	What disturbed people so much about  and I would agree with Senator Sanders on this  leading us into Iraq under false pretenses and telling us, as a people, that there were weapons of mass destruction there was  was one of the worst blunders in modern American history.
0497	O'MALLEY	But the reason why people remain angry about it is because people feel like a lot of our legislators got railroaded in a war fever and by polls.
0498	O'MALLEY	And I remember being at a dinner shortly before that invasion.
0499	O'MALLEY	People were talking at  and saying, "it'll take us just a couple years to rebuild democracy," and I thought, "has this world gone mad?"
0500	O'MALLEY	Whenever we go  and contrary to John Quincy Adams' advice  "searching the world for monsters to destroy," and when we use political might to take a  at the expense of democratic principle, we hurt ourselves, and we hurt our
0501	SYSTEM	[ inaudible ]
0502	O'MALLEY	.
0503	COOPER	Does she  does she want to use military force too rapidly?
0504	O'MALLEY	I believe that, as president, I would not be so quick to pull for a military tool.
0505	O'MALLEY	I believe that a nofly zone in Syria, at this time, actually, Secretary, would be a mistake.
0506	O'MALLEY	You have to enforce nofly zones, and I believe, especially with the Russian air force in the air, it could lead to an escalation because of an accident that we would deeply regret.
0507	O'MALLEY	I support President Obama.
0508	O'MALLEY	I think we have to play a long game, and I think, ultimately  you want to talk about blunders?
0509	O'MALLEY	I think Assad's invasion of Syria will be seen as a blunder.
0510	COOPER	Governor O'Malley, just for the record, on the campaign trail, you've been saying that Secretary Clinton is always quick for the  for the military intervention.
0511	COOPER	Senator  Secretary Clinton, you can respond.
0512	CLINTON	Well, first of all, I...
0513	WEBB	Anderson, can I come into this discussion at some point?
0514	COOPER	Well  yes, you'll be coming in next, but she was directly quoted, Senator.
0515	WEBB	Thank you.
0516	WEBB	I've been standing over here for about ten minutes, trying.
0517	COOPER	OK.
0518	WEBB	It's just  it's gone back and forth over there.

0524	SYSTEM	[ inaudible ]
0525	WEBB	.
0526	CLINTON	You know, I have to say, I was very pleased when Governor O'Malley endorsed me for president in 2008, and I enjoyed his strong support in that campaign.
0527	CLINTON	And I consider him, obviously, a friend.
0528	CLINTON	Let me say  because there's a lot of loose talk going on here  we are already flying in Syria just as we are flying in Iraq.
0529	CLINTON	The president has made a very tough decision.
0530	CLINTON	What I believe and why I have advocated that the nofly zone  which of course would be in a coalition  be put on the table is because I'm trying to figure out what leverage we have to get Russia to the table.
0531	CLINTON	You know, diplomacy is not about getting to the perfect solution.
0532	CLINTON	It's about how you balance the risks.
0533	COOPER	Thank you.
0534	CLINTON	And I think we have an opportunity here  and I know that inside the administration this is being hotly debated  to get that leverage to try to get the Russians to have to deal with everybody in the region and begin to move toward a political, diplomatic solution in Syria.
0535	COOPER	Thank you, Secretary.
0536	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
0537	COOPER	Senator Webb, you said as president you would never have used military force in Libya and that the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi was, in your words, "inevitable."
0538	COOPER	Should Secretary Clinton have seen that attack coming?
0539	WEBB	Look, let's start  I've been trying to get in this conversation for about 10 minutes  let's start with why Russia is in Syria right now.
0540	WEBB	There are three strategic failings that have allowed this to occur.
0541	WEBB	The first was the invasion of Iraq, which destabilized ethnic elements in Iraq and empowered Iran.
0542	WEBB	The second was the Arab Spring, which created huge vacuums in Libya and in Syria that allowed terrorist movements to move in there.
0543	WEBB	And the third was the recent deal allowing Iran to move forward and eventually acquire a nuclear weapon, which sent bad signals, bad body language into the region about whether we are acquiescing in Iran becoming a stronger piece of the formula in that part of the world.
0544	WEBB	Now, I say this as someone who spent five years in the Pentagon and who opposed the war in Iraq, whose son fought in Iraq, I've fought in Vietnam.
0545	WEBB	But if you want a place where we need to be in terms of our national strategy, a focus, the greatest strategic threat that we have right now is resolving our relationship with China.
0546	WEBB	And we need to do this because of their aggression in the region.
0547	WEBB	We need to do it because of the way they treat their own people.
0548	COOPER	Senator...
0549	WEBB	And I would say this.
0550	WEBB	I've been waiting for 10 minutes.
0551	WEBB	I will say this.
0552	COOPER	You're over your time as of now.
0553	WEBB	I will  well, you've let a lot of people go over their time.
0554	WEBB	I would say this...
0555	COOPER	You agreed to these debate rules.
0556	WEBB	... to the unelected, authoritarian government of China You do not own the South China Sea.
0557	WEBB	You do not have the right to conduct cyber warfare against tens of millions of American citizens.
0558	WEBB	And in a Webb administration, we will do something about that.
0559	COOPER	Senator Sanders, I want you to be able to respond.
0560	SANDERS	Pardon me?
0561	COOPER	I'd like you to be able to respond and get in on this.
0562	SANDERS	Well, I think Mr. Putin is going to regret what he is doing.
0563	SANDERS	I think that when he gets into that...
0564	COOPER	He doesn't seem to be the type of guy to regret a lot.
0565	SANDERS	Well, I think he's already regretting what he did in Crimea and what he is doing in the Ukraine.
0566	SANDERS	I think he is really regretting the decline of his economy.
0567	SANDERS	And I think what he is trying to do now is save some face.
0568	SANDERS	But I think when Russians get killed in Syria and when he gets bogged down, I think the Russian people are going to give him a message that maybe they should come home, maybe they should start working with the United States to rectify the situation now.
0569	COOPER	Secretary Clinton, on the campaign trail, Governor Webb has said that he would never have used military force in Libya and that the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi was inevitable.
0570	COOPER	Should you have seen that attack coming?
0571	CLINTON	Well, let's remember what was going on.
0572	CLINTON	We had a murderous dictator, Gadhafi, who had American blood on his hands, as I'm sure you remember, threatening to massacre large numbers of the Libyan people.
0573	CLINTON	We had our closest allies in Europe burning up the phone lines begging us to help them try to prevent what they saw as a mass genocide, in their words.
0574	CLINTON	And we had the Arabs standing by our side saying, "We want you to help us deal with Gadhafi."
0575	CLINTON	Our response, which I think was smart power at its best, is that the United States will not lead this.
0576	CLINTON	We will provide essential, unique capabilities that we have, but the Europeans and the Arabs had to be first over the line.
0577	CLINTON	We did not put one single American soldier on the ground in Libya.
0578	CLINTON	And I'll say this for the Libyan people...
0579	COOPER	But American citizens did lose their lives in Benghazi.
0580	CLINTON	But let  I'll get to that.
0581	CLINTON	But I think it's important, since I understand Senator Webb's very strong feelings about this, to explain where we were then and to point out that I think President Obama made the right decision at the time.
0582	CLINTON	And the Libyan people had a free election the first time since 1951.
0583	CLINTON	And you know what, they voted for moderates, they voted with the hope of democracy.
0584	CLINTON	Because of the Arab Spring, because of a lot of other things, there was turmoil to be followed.
0585	CLINTON	But unless you believe the United States should not send diplomats to any place that is dangerous, which I do not, then when we send them forth, there is always the potential for danger and risk.
0586	COOPER	Governor O'Malley?
0587	WEBB	Can I...
0588	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
0589	O'MALLEY	Anderson, I think we are learning...
0590	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
0591	O'MALLEY	Anderson, I think there's lessons to be learned from Benghazi.
0592	O'MALLEY	And those lessons are that we need to do a much better job as a nation of having human intelligence on the ground so that we know who the emerging next generation leaders are that are coming up to replace a dictator when his time on this planet ends.
0593	O'MALLEY	And I believe that's what Chris Stevens was trying to do.
0594	O'MALLEY	But he did not have the tools.
0595	O'MALLEY	We have failed as a country to invest in the human intelligence that would allow us to make not only better decisions in Libya, but better decisions in Syria today.
0596	O'MALLEY	And it's a huge national security failing.
0597	COOPER	Senator Webb, I want you to be able to respond.
0598	WEBB	Thank you.
0599	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
0600	COOPER	Senator Webb?
0601	WEBB	This is not about Benghazi per se.
0602	WEBB	To me it is the inevitability of something like Benghazi occurring in the way that we intervened in Libya.
0603	WEBB	We had no treaties at risk.
0604	WEBB	We had no Americans at risk.
0605	WEBB	There was no threat of attack or imminent attack.
0606	WEBB	There is plenty of time for a president to come to the Congress and request authority to use military force in that situation.
0607	WEBB	I called for it on the Senate floor again and again.
0608	WEBB	I called for it in Senate hearings.
0609	WEBB	It is not a wise thing to do.
0610	WEBB	And if people think it was a wise thing to do, try to get to the Tripoli airport today.
0611	WEBB	You can't do it.
0612	COOPER	Secretary (sic) Webb, you served in Vietnam.
0613	COOPER	You're a marine.
0614	COOPER	Once a marine, always a marine.
0615	COOPER	You served as a marine in Vietnam.
0616	COOPER	You're a decorated war hero.
0617	COOPER	You eventually became secretary of the navy.
0618	COOPER	During the Vietnam War, the man standing next to you, Senator Sanders, applied for status as a conscientious objector.
0619	COOPER	Given his history, can he serve as a credible commanderinchief?
0620	WEBB	Everybody makes their decisions when the time there is conscription.
0621	WEBB	And as long as they go through the legal process that our country requires, I respect that.
0622	WEBB	And it would be for the voters to decide whether Senator Sanders or anyone else should be president.
0623	WEBB	I will say this, coming from the position that I've come from, from a military family, with my brother a marine, my son was a marine in Iraq, I served as a marine, spending five years in the Pentagon, I am comfortable that I am the most qualified person standing up here today to be your commanderinchief.
0624	COOPER	Senator Sanders, tell an American soldier who is watching right now tonight in Afghanistan why you can be commanderin chief given that you applied for conscientious objector status.
0625	SANDERS	Well, first of all, let me applaud my good friend Jim Webb for his service to this country in so many ways.
0626	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0627	SANDERS	Jim and I, under Jim's leadership, as he indicated, passed the most significant veterans education bill in recent history.
0628	SANDERS	We followed suit with a few years later passing, under my leadership, the most significant veterans' health care legislation in the modern history of this country.
0629	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0630	SANDERS	When I was a young man  I'm not a young man today.
0631	SANDERS	When I was a young man, I strongly opposed the war in Vietnam.
0632	SANDERS	Not the brave men like Jim who fought in that war, but the policy which got us involved in that war.
0633	SANDERS	That was my view then.
0634	SYSTEM	[ cheering and applause ]
0635	SANDERS	I am not a pacifist, Anderson.
0636	SANDERS	I supported the war in Afghanistan.
0637	SANDERS	I supported President Clinton's effort to deal with ethnic cleansing in Kosovo.
0638	SANDERS	I support air strikes in Syria and what the president is trying to do.
0639	SANDERS	Yes, I happen to believe from the bottom of my heart that war should be the last resort that we have got to exercise diplomacy.
0640	SANDERS	But yes, I am prepared to take this country into war if that is necessary.
0641	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
0642	COOPER	Very quickly, 30 seconds for each of you.
0643	COOPER	Governor Chafee, who or what is the greatest national security threat to the United States?
0644	COOPER	I want to go down the line.
0645	CHAFEE	OK.
0646	CHAFEE	I just have to answer one thing that Senator Webb said about the Iran deal, because I'm a strong proponent of what President Obama  and he said that because of that the Iran deal that enabled Russia to come in.
0647	CHAFEE	No, that's not true, Senator Webb.
0648	CHAFEE	I respect your foreign policy chops.
0649	CHAFEE	But Russia is aligned with Iran and with Assad and the Alawite Shias in Syria.
0650	CHAFEE	So that Iran deal did not allow Russia to come in.
0651	COOPER	OK.
0652	COOPER	Senator, I can give you 30 seconds to respond.
0653	WEBB	I believe that the signal that we sent to the region when the Iran nuclear deal was concluded was that we are accepting Iran's greater position on this very important balance of power, among our greatest ally Israel, and the Sunnis represented by the Saudi regime, and Iran.
0654	WEBB	It was a position of weakness and I think it encouraged the acts that we've seen in the past several weeks.
0655	COOPER	Thirty seconds for each of you.
0656	COOPER	Governor Chafee, what is the greatest national security threat to the United States?
0657	CHAFEE	It's certainly the chaos in the Middle East.
0658	CHAFEE	There's no doubt about it.
0659	COOPER	OK.
0660	CHAFEE	And it all started with the Iraq invasion.
0661	COOPER	Governor O'Malley?
0662	O'MALLEY	I believe that nuclear Iran remains the biggest threat, along with the threat of ISIL climate change, of course, makes cascading threats even more (inaudible).
0663	COOPER	Secretary Clinton, the greatest national security threat?
0664	CLINTON	I  I think it has to be continued threat from the spread of nuclear weapons, nuclear material that can fall into the wrong hands.
0665	CLINTON	I know the terrorists are constantly seeking it, and that's why we have to stay vigilant, but also united around the world to prevent that.
0666	COOPER	Senator Sanders, greatest national security threat?
0667	SANDERS	The scientific community is telling us that if we do not address the global crisis of climate change, transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to sustainable energy, the planet that we're going to be leaving our kids and our grandchildren may well not be habitable.
0668	SANDERS	That is a major crisis.
0669	COOPER	Senator Webb?
0670	WEBB	Our greatest longterm strategic challenge is our relation with China.
0671	WEBB	Our greatest daytoday threat is cyber warfare against this country.
0672	WEBB	Our greatest militaryoperational threat is resolving the situations in the Middle East.
0673	COOPER	All right.
0674	COOPER	We're going to take a short break.
0675	COOPER	Do these candidates see eye to eye on an issue that is driving a big wedge between Republicans?
0676	COOPER	That is next.
0677	COOPER	We'll be right back.
0678	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0679	SYSTEM	[ commercial break ]
0680	COOPER	And welcome back.
0681	COOPER	We are live in Nevada, in Las Vegas, at the Wynn Resort for the first Democratic presidential debate.
0682	COOPER	The questions continue.
0683	COOPER	We begin with Secretary Clinton.
0684	COOPER	Secretary Clinton, you are going to be testifying before Congress next week about your emails.
0685	COOPER	For the last eight months, you haven't been able to put this issue behind you.
0686	COOPER	You dismissed it you joked about it you called it a mistake.
0687	COOPER	What does that say about your ability to handle far more challenging crises as president?
0688	CLINTON	Well, I've taken responsibility for it.
0689	CLINTON	I did say it was a mistake.
0690	CLINTON	What I did was allowed by the State Department, but it wasn't the best choice.
0691	CLINTON	And I have been as transparent as I know to be, turning over 55,000 pages of my emails, asking that they be made public.
0692	CLINTON	And you're right.
0693	CLINTON	I am going to be testifying.
0694	CLINTON	I've been asking to testify for some time and to do it in public, which was not originally agreed to.
0695	CLINTON	But let's just take a minute here and point out that this committee is basically an arm of the Republican National Committee.
0696	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0697	CLINTON	It is a partisan vehicle, as admitted by the House Republican majority leader, Mr. McCarthy, to drive down my poll numbers.
0698	CLINTON	Big surprise.
0699	CLINTON	And that's what they have attempted to do.
0700	CLINTON	I am still standing.
0701	CLINTON	I am happy to be part of this debate.
0702	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0703	CLINTON	And I intend to keep talking about the issues that matter to the American people.
0704	CLINTON	You know, I believe strongly that we need to be talking about what people talk to me about, like how are we going to make college affordable?
0705	CLINTON	How are we going to pay down student debt?
0706	COOPER	Secretary...
0707	CLINTON	How are we going to get health care for everybody...
0708	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
0709	COOPER	Secretary Clinton, Secretary Clinton, with all due respect, it's a little hard  I mean, isn't it a little bit hard to call this just a partisan issue?
0710	COOPER	There's an FBI investigation, and President Obama himself just two days ago said this is a legitimate issue.
0711	CLINTON	Well, I never said it wasn't legitimate.
0712	CLINTON	I said that I have answered all the questions and I will certainly be doing so again before this committee.
0713	CLINTON	But I think it would be really unfair not to look at the entire picture.
0714	CLINTON	This committee has spent $4.5 million of taxpayer money, and they said that they were trying to figure out what we could do better to protect our diplomats so that something like Benghazi wouldn't happen again.
0715	CLINTON	There were already seven committee reports about what to do.
0716	CLINTON	So I think it's pretty clear what their obvious goal is.
0717	COOPER	Thank you.
0718	CLINTON	But I'll be there.
0719	CLINTON	I'll answer their questions.
0720	CLINTON	But tonight, I want to talk not about my emails, but about what the American people want from the next president of the United States.
0721	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0722	COOPER	Senator Sanders?
0723	SANDERS	Let me say this.
0724	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0725	SANDERS	Let me say  let me say something that may not be great politics.
0726	SANDERS	But I think the secretary is right, and that is that the American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails.
0727	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0728	CLINTON	Thank you.
0729	CLINTON	Me, too.
0730	CLINTON	Me, too.
0731	SANDERS	You know?
0732	SANDERS	The middle class  Anderson, and let me say something about the media, as well.
0733	SANDERS	I go around the country, talk to a whole lot of people.
0734	SANDERS	Middle class in this country is collapsing.
0735	SANDERS	We have 27 million people living in poverty.
0736	SANDERS	We have massive wealth and income inequality.
0737	SANDERS	Our trade policies have cost us millions of decent jobs.
0738	SANDERS	The American people want to know whether we're going to have a democracy or an oligarchy as a result of Citizens Union.
0739	SANDERS	Enough of the emails.
0740	SANDERS	Let's talk about the real issues facing America.
0741	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0742	CLINTON	Thank you, Bernie.
0743	CLINTON	Thank you.
0744	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0745	COOPER	It's obviously very popular in this crowd, and it's  hold on.
0746	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0747	COOPER	I know that plays well in this room.
0748	COOPER	But I got to be honest, Governor Chafee, for the record, on the campaign trail, you've said a different thing.
0749	COOPER	You said this is a huge issue.
0750	COOPER	Standing here in front of Secretary Clinton, are you willing to say that to her face?
0751	CHAFEE	Absolutely.
0752	CHAFEE	We have to repair American credibility after we told the world that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which he didn't.
0753	CHAFEE	So there's an issue of American credibility out there.
0754	CHAFEE	So any time someone is running to be our leader, and a world leader, which the American president is, credibility is an issue out there with the world.
0755	CHAFEE	And we have repair work to be done.
0756	CHAFEE	I think we need someone that has the best in ethical standards as our next president.
0757	CHAFEE	That's how I feel.
0758	COOPER	Secretary Clinton, do you want to respond?
0759	CLINTON	No.
0760	COOPER	Governor  Governor...
0761	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0762	COOPER	Governor O'Malley...
0763	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0764	COOPER	Governor, it's popular in the room, but a lot of people do want to know these answers.
0765	COOPER	Governor O'Malley, you expressed concern on the campaign trail that the Democratic Party is, and I quote, "being defined by Hillary Clinton's email scandal."
0766	COOPER	You heard her answer, do you still feel that way tonight?
0767	O'MALLEY	I believe that now that we're finally having debates, Anderson, that we don't have to be defined by the email scandal, and how long  what the FBI's asking about.
0768	O'MALLEY	Instead, we can talk about affordable college, making college debt free, and all the issues.
0769	O'MALLEY	Which is why  and I see the chair of the DNC here, look how glad we are actually to be talking about the issues that matter the most to people around the kitchen table.
0770	O'MALLEY	We need to get wages to go up, college more affordable...
0771	COOPER	...Thank you, governor.
0772	O'MALLEY	...we need to make American 100 percent clean electric by 2050.
0773	COOPER	I want to talk about issues of race in America, for that I want to start of with Don Lemon.
0774	LEMON	Alright, Anderson, thank you very much.
0775	LEMON	I'm not sure how to follow that, but this question is about something that has tripped some of the candidates up out on the campaign trail.
0776	LEMON	Can you hear me?
0777	LEMON	Can't hear me in the room.
0778	LEMON	OK, here we go again, as I said...
0779	WILKINS	...law school.
0780	WILKINS	My question for the candidates is, do black lives matter, or do all lives matter?
0781	COOPER	The question from Arthur...
0782	LEMON	...There we go...
0783	COOPER	...Do black lives matter, or do all lives matter?
0784	COOPER	Let's put that question to Senator Sanders.
0785	SANDERS	Black lives matter.
0786	SANDERS	[
0787	SANDERS	cheering ] And the reason  the reason those words matter is the African American community knows that on any given day some innocent person like Sandra Bland can get into a car, and then three days later she's going to end up dead in jail, or their kids...
0788	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0789	SANDERS	...are going to get shot.
0790	SANDERS	We need to combat institutional racism from top to bottom, and we need major, major reforms in a broken criminal justice system...
0791	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0792	SANDERS	...In which we have more people in jail than China.
0793	SANDERS	And, I intended to tackle that issue.
0794	SANDERS	To make sure that our people have education and jobs rather than jail cells.
0795	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0796	COOPER	Governor O'Malley, the question from Arthur was do black lives matter, or do all lives matter?
0797	O'MALLEY	Anderson, the point that the Black Lives Matter movement is making is a very, very legitimate and serious point, and that is that as a nation we have undervalued the lives of black lives, people of color.
0798	O'MALLEY	When I ran for Mayor of Baltimore  and we we burying over 350 young men ever single year, mostly young, and poor, and black, and I said to our legislature, at the time when I appeared in front of them as a mayor, that if we were burying white, young, poor men in these number we would be marching in the streets and there would be a different reaction.
0799	O'MALLEY	Black lives matter, and we have a lot of work to do to reform our criminal justice system, and to address race relations in our country.
0800	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0801	COOPER	Secretary Clinton, what would you do for African Americans in this country that President Obama couldn't?
0802	CLINTON	Well, I think that President Obama has been a great moral leader on these issues, and has laid out an agenda that has been obstructed by the Republicans at every turn, so...
0803	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0804	CLINTON	...So, what we need to be doing is not only reforming criminal justice  I have talked about that at some length, including things like body cameras, but we also need to be following the recommendations of the commissioner that President Obama empanelled on policing.
0805	CLINTON	There is an agenda there that we need to be following up on.
0806	CLINTON	Similarly, we need to tackle mass incarceration, and this may be the only bipartisan issue in the congress this year.
0807	CLINTON	We actually have people on both sides of the aisle who have reached the same conclusion, that we can not keep imprisoning more people than anybody else in the world.
0808	CLINTON	But, I believe that the debate, and the discussion has to go further, Anderson, because we've got to do more about the lives of these children.
0809	CLINTON	That's why I started off by saying we need to be committed to making it possible for every child to live up to his or her god given potential.
0810	CLINTON	That is...
0811	COOPER	...Thank you, Senator...
0812	CLINTON	...really hard to do if you don't have early childhood education...
0813	COOPER	Senator...
0814	CLINTON	...if you don't have schools that are able to meet the needs of the people, or good housing, there's a long list...
0815	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0816	CLINTON	...We need a new New Deal for communities of color...
0817	COOPER	Senator Webb?
0818	WEBB	I hope I can get that kind of time here.
0819	WEBB	As a President of the United States, every life in this country matters.
0820	WEBB	At the same time, I believe I can say to you, I have had a long history of working with the situation of African Americans.
0821	WEBB	We're talking about criminal justice reform, I risked my political life raising the issue of criminal justice reform when I ran for the Senate in Virginia in 2006.
0822	WEBB	I had democratic party political consultants telling me I was committing political suicide.
0823	WEBB	We led that issue in the congress.
0824	WEBB	We started a national debate on it.
0825	WEBB	And it wasn't until then that the Republican Party started joining in.
0826	WEBB	I also represented a socalled war criminal, an African American Marine who was wounded  who was convicted of murder in Vietnam, for six years.
0827	WEBB	He took his life three years into this.
0828	WEBB	I cleared his name after  after three years.
0829	COOPER	Thanks, sir.
0830	WEBB	And I put the African American soldier on the Mall.
0831	WEBB	I made that recommendation and fought for it.
0832	WEBB	So, if you want someone who is  can stand up in front of you right now and say I have done the hard job, I have taken the risks, I am your person.
0833	COOPER	Senator Sanders, let's talk about income inequality.
0834	COOPER	Wages and incomes are flat.
0835	COOPER	You've argued that the gap between rich and poor is wider than at any time since the 1920s.
0836	COOPER	We've had a Democratic president for seven years.
0837	COOPER	What are you going to be able to do that President Obama didn't?
0838	SANDERS	Well, first of all, let's remember where we were when Bush left office.
0839	SANDERS	We were losing 800,000 jobs a month.
0840	SANDERS	And I know my Republican friends seem to have some amnesia on this issue, but the world's financial crisis was on  the world's financial markets system was on the verge of collapse.
0841	SANDERS	That's where we were.
0842	SANDERS	Are we better off today than we were then?
0843	SANDERS	Absolutely.
0844	SANDERS	But the truth is that for the 40 years, the great middle class of this country has been disappearing.
0845	SANDERS	And in my view what we need to do is create millions of jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour pay equity for women workers and our disastrous trade policies, which have cost us millions of jobs and make every public college and university in this country tuition free.
0846	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0847	COOPER	Secretary Clinton...
0848	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
0849	COOPER	I'll let you jump in a moment.
0850	COOPER	Everybody will get in on this in a moment.
0851	COOPER	Secretary Clinton, how would you address this issue?
0852	COOPER	In all candor, you and your husband are part of the one percent.
0853	COOPER	How can you credibly represent the views of the middle class?
0854	CLINTON	Well, you know, both Bill and I have been very blessed.
0855	CLINTON	Neither of us came from wealthy families and we've worked really hard our entire lives.
0856	CLINTON	And I want to make sure every single person in this country has the same opportunities that he and I have had, to make the most of their Godgiven potential and to have the chances that they should have in America for a good education, good job training, and then good jobs.
0857	CLINTON	I have a five point economic plan, because this inequality challenge we face, we have faced it at other points.
0858	CLINTON	It's absolutely right.
0859	CLINTON	It hasn't been this bad since the 1920s.
0860	CLINTON	But if you look at the Republicans versus the Democrats when it comes to economic policy, there is no comparison.
0861	CLINTON	The economy does better when you have a Democrat in the White House and that's why we need to have a Democrat in the White House in January 2017.
0862	COOPER	Governor O'Malley, (inaudible).
0863	O'MALLEY	Yes.
0864	O'MALLEY	Anderson, I want to associate myself with many of the items that the senator from Vermont mentioned, and I actually did them in our state.
0865	O'MALLEY	We raised the minimum wage, passed the living wage, invested more in infrastructure, went four years in a row without a penny's increase in college tuition.
0866	O'MALLEY	But there's another piece that Senator Sanders left out tonight, but he's been excellent about underscoring that.
0867	O'MALLEY	And that is that we need to separate the casino, speculative, megabank gambling that we have to insure with our money, from the commercial banking  namely, reinstating GlassSteagall.
0868	O'MALLEY	Secretary Clinton mentioned my support eight years ago.
0869	O'MALLEY	And Secretary, I was proud to support you eight years ago, but something happened in between, and that is, Anderson, a Wall Street crash that wiped out millions of jobs and millions of savings for families.
0870	O'MALLEY	And we are still just as vulnerable Paul Volcker says today.
0871	O'MALLEY	We need to reinstate GlassSteagall and that's a huge difference on this stage among us as candidates.
0872	COOPER	Just for viewers at home who may not be reading up on this, GlassSteagall is the Depressionera banking law repealed in 1999 that prevented commercial banks from engaging in investment banking and insurance activities.
0873	COOPER	Secretary Clinton, he raises a fundamental difference on this stage.
0874	COOPER	Senator Sanders wants to break up the big Wall Street banks.
0875	COOPER	You don't.
0876	COOPER	You say charge the banks more, continue to monitor them.
0877	COOPER	Why is your plan better?
0878	CLINTON	Well, my plan is more comprehensive.
0879	CLINTON	And frankly, it's tougher because of course we have to deal with the problem that the banks are still too big to fail.
0880	CLINTON	We can never let the American taxpayer and middle class families ever have to bail out the kind of speculative behavior that we saw.
0881	CLINTON	But we also have to worry about some of the other players  AIG, a big insurance company Lehman Brothers, an investment bank.
0882	CLINTON	There's this whole area called "shadow banking."
0883	CLINTON	That's where the experts tell me the next potential problem could come from.
0884	CLINTON	So I'm with both Senator Sanders and Governor O'Malley in putting a lot of attention onto the banks.
0885	CLINTON	And the plan that I have put forward would actually empower regulators to break up big banks if we thought they posed a risk.
0886	CLINTON	But I want to make sure we're going to cover everybody, not what caused the problem last time, but what could cause it next time.
0887	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
0888	COOPER	Senator Sanders, Secretary Clinton just said that her policy is tougher than yours.
0889	SANDERS	Well, that's not true.
0890	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
0891	COOPER	Why?
0892	SANDERS	Let us be clear that the greed and recklessness and illegal behavior of Wall Street, where fraud is a business model, helped to destroy this economy and the lives of millions of people.
0893	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0894	SANDERS	Check the record.
0895	SANDERS	In the 1990s  and all due respect  in the 1990s, when I had the Republican leadership and Wall Street spending billions of dollars in lobbying, when the Clinton administration, when Alan Greenspan said, "what a great idea it would be to allow these huge banks to merge," Bernie Sanders fought them, and helped lead the opposition to deregulation.
0896	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0897	SANDERS	Today, it is my view that when you have the three...
0898	COOPER	Senator...
0899	SANDERS	...largest banks in America  are much bigger than they were when we bailed them out for being too big to fail, we have got to break them up.
0900	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0901	COOPER	Secretary Clinton, you have to be able to respond.
0902	COOPER	He brought you up.
0903	CLINTON	Yeah.
0904	CLINTON	You know, I  I respect the passion an intensity.
0905	CLINTON	I represented Wall Street, as a senator from New York, and I went to Wall Street in December of 2007  before the big crash that we had  and I basically said, "cut it out!
0906	CLINTON	Quit foreclosing on homes!
0907	CLINTON	Quit engaging in these kinds of speculative behaviors."
0908	CLINTON	I took on the Bush administration for the same thing.
0909	CLINTON	So I have thought deeply and long about what we're gonna do to do exactly what I think both the senator and the governor want, which is to rein in and stop this risk.
0910	CLINTON	And my plan would have the potential of actually sending the executives to jail.
0911	CLINTON	Nobody went to jail after $100 billion in fines were paid...
0912	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0913	SYSTEM	[ inaudible ]
0914	CLINTON	...and would give regulators the authority to go after the big banks.
0915	COOPER	Thank you.
0916	COOPER	Thank you.
0917	COOPER	Senator Sanders...
0918	CLINTON	But I'm telling you  I will say it tonight.
0919	CLINTON	If only you look at the big banks, you may be missing the forest for the trees.
0920	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
0921	WEBB	Bernie, say my name so I can get into this.
0922	SANDERS	I will, just a second.
0923	WEBB	OK.
0924	WEBB	Thank you.
0925	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
0926	SANDERS	I'll tell him.
0927	SANDERS	In my view, Secretary Clinton, you do not  Congress does not regulate Wall Street.
0928	SANDERS	Wall Street regulates Congress.
0929	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0930	SANDERS	And we have gotta break off these banks.
0931	SANDERS	Going to them...
0932	CLINTON	So...
0933	SANDERS	...and saying, "please, do the right thing"...
0934	CLINTON	...no, that's not what...
0935	SANDERS	...is kind of naive.
0936	CLINTON	...that  I think DoddFrank was a very...
0937	WEBB	Anderson, I need to jump in (inaudible).
0938	CLINTON	...good start, and I think that we have to implement it.
0939	CLINTON	We have to prevent the Republicans from ripping it apart.
0940	CLINTON	We have to save the Consumer Financial Protection board, which is finally beginning to act to protect consumers.
0941	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0942	CLINTON	We have work to do.
0943	CLINTON	You've got no argument from me.
0944	CLINTON	But I know, if we don't come in with a very tough and comprehensive approach, like the plan I'm recommending, we're gonna be behind instead of ahead...
0945	COOPER	Governor O'Malley?
0946	COOPER	Where do you stand?
0947	CLINTON	...on what the next crisis could be.
0948	O'MALLEY	Anderson, look, this is  the big banks  I mean, once we repealed GlassSteagall back in the late 1999s (ph), the big banks, the six of them, went from controlling, what, the equivalent of 15 percent of our GDP to now 65 percent of our GDP.
0949	O'MALLEY	And  (inaudible) right before this debate, Secretary Clinton's campaign put out a lot of reversals on positions on Keystone and many other things.
0950	O'MALLEY	But one of them that we still have a great difference on, Madam Secretary, is that you are not for GlassSteagall.
0951	O'MALLEY	You are not for putting a firewall between this speculative, risky shadow banking behavior.
0952	O'MALLEY	I am, and the people of our country need a president who's on their side, willing to protect the Main Street economy from recklessness on Wall Street.
0953	O'MALLEY	We have to fulfill...
0954	COOPER	Secretary Clinton...
0955	O'MALLEY	...our promise.
0956	COOPER	I have to let you respond.
0957	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0958	CLINTON	Well, you know, everybody on this stage has changed a position or two.
0959	CLINTON	We've been around a cumulative quite some period of time.
0960	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
0961	CLINTON	You know, we know that if you are learning, you're gonna change your position.
0962	CLINTON	I never took a position on Keystone until I took a position on Keystone.
0963	CLINTON	But I have been on the forefront of dealing with climate change, starting in 2009, when President Obama and I crashed (ph) a meeting with the Chinese and got them to sign up to the first international agreement to combat climate change that they'd ever joined.
0964	CLINTON	So I'm...
0965	COOPER	Thank you.
0966	CLINTON	...not taking a back seat to anybody on my values...
0967	COOPER	Thank...
0968	CLINTON	...my principles and the results that I get.
0969	COOPER	Senator Sanders...
0970	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0971	COOPER	Senator Sanders, in 2008, congressional leaders were told, without the 2008 bailout, the U.S. was possibly days away from a complete meltdown.
0972	COOPER	Despite that, you still voted against it.
0973	COOPER	As president, would you stand by your principles if it risked the country's financial stability?
0974	SANDERS	Well, I remember that meeting very well.
0975	SANDERS	I remember it like it was yesterday.
0976	SANDERS	Hank Paulson, Bernanke came in, and they say, "guys, the economy is going to collapse because Wall Street is going under.
0977	SANDERS	It's gonna take the economy with them."
0978	SANDERS	And you know what I said to Hank Paulson?
0979	SANDERS	I said, "Hank, your guys  you come from Goldman Sachs.
0980	SANDERS	Your millionaire and billionaire friends caused this problem.
0981	SANDERS	How about your millionaire and billionaire friends paying for the bailout, not working families in this country?"
0982	SANDERS	So to answer your question, no, I would not have let the economy collapse.
0983	SANDERS	But it was wrong to ask the middle class to bail out Wall Street.
0984	SANDERS	And by the way, I want Wall Street now to help kids in this country go to college, public colleges and universities, free with a Wall Street speculation tax.
0985	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0986	COOPER	We're going to talk about that in a minute.
0987	COOPER	But, Senator Webb, I want to get you in.
0988	COOPER	You have said neither party has the guts to take on Wall Street.
0989	COOPER	Is the system rigged?
0990	WEBB	There is a reality that I think we all need to recognize with respect to the power of the financial sector.
0991	WEBB	And let me just go back a minute and say that on this TARP program, I introduced a piece of legislation calling for a windfall profits tax on the executives of any of these companies that got more than $5 billion, that it was time for them, once they got their compensation and their bonus, to split the rest of the money they made with the nurses and the truck drivers and the soldiers who bailed them out.
0992	WEBB	With respect to the financial sector, I mean, I know that my time has run out but in speaking of changing positions and the position on how this debate has occurred is kind of frustrating because unless somebody mentions my name I can't get into the discussion.
0993	COOPER	You agreed to these rules and you're wasting time.
0994	COOPER	So if you would finish your answer, we'll move on.
0995	WEBB	All right.
0996	WEBB	Well, I'm trying to set a mark here so maybe we can get into a little more later on.
0997	WEBB	This hasn't been equal time.
0998	WEBB	But if you want to look at what has happened, if we look at the facts in terms of how we're going to deal with this, since that crash, in the last 10 years, the amount of the world's capital economy that Wall Street manages has gone from 44 percent to 55 percent.
0999	WEBB	That means the Wall Street money managers are not risking themselves as the same way the American people are when they're going to get their compensation.
1000	WEBB	They're managing money from all over the world.
1001	WEBB	We have to take that into consideration when we're looking at ways to regulate it.
1002	COOPER	Governor Chafee, you have attacked Secretary Clinton for being too close to Wall Street banks.
1003	COOPER	In 1999 you voted for the very bill that made banks bigger.
1004	CHAFEE	The GlassSteagall was my very first vote, I'd just arrived, my dad had died in office, I was appointed to the office, it was my very first vote.
1005	COOPER	Are you saying you didn't know what you were voting for?
1006	CHAFEE	I'd just arrived at the Senate.
1007	CHAFEE	I think we'd get some takeovers, and that was one.
1008	CHAFEE	It was my very first vote, and it was 925.
1009	CHAFEE	It was the...
1010	COOPER	Well, with all due respect, Governor...
1011	CHAFEE	But let me just say...
1012	COOPER	... what does that say about you that you're casting a vote for something you weren't really sure about?
1013	CHAFEE	I think you're being a little rough.
1014	CHAFEE	I'd just arrived at the United States Senate.
1015	CHAFEE	I'd been mayor of my city.
1016	CHAFEE	My dad had died.
1017	CHAFEE	I'd been appointed by the governor.
1018	CHAFEE	It was the first vote and it was 905, because it was a conference report.
1019	CHAFEE	But let me just say about income inequality.
1020	CHAFEE	We've had a lot of talk over the last few minutes, hours, or tens of minutes, but no one is saying how we're going to fix it.
1021	CHAFEE	And it all started with the Bush tax cuts that favored the wealthy.
1022	CHAFEE	So let's go back to the tax code.
1023	CHAFEE	And 0.6 percent of Americans are at the top echelon, over 464,000, 0.6 Americans.
1024	CHAFEE	That's less than 1 percent.
1025	CHAFEE	But they generate 30 percent of the revenue.
1026	CHAFEE	And they're doing fine.
1027	COOPER	Thank you, Governor.
1028	CHAFEE	So there's still a lot more money to be had from this top echelon.
1029	CHAFEE	I'm saying let's have another tier and put that back into the tax bracket.
1030	CHAFEE	And that will generate $42 billion.
1031	COOPER	I want to bring in Dana Bash.
1032	CHAFEE	And then we can help the middle class and hardearning Americans  hardworking Americans.
1033	COOPER	Dana?
1034	BASH	Thank you.
1035	BASH	CNN visited college campuses, along with Facebook.
1036	BASH	And not surprisingly college affordability was among the most pressing issue.
1037	BASH	Senator Sanders, you've mentioned a couple of times you do have a plan to make public colleges free for everyone.
1038	BASH	Secretary Clinton has criticized that in saying she's not in favor of making a college free for Donald Trump's kids.
1039	BASH	Do you think taxpayers should pick up the tab for wealthy children?
1040	SANDERS	Well, let me tell you, Donald Trump and his billionaire friends under my policies are going to pay a hell of a lot more in taxes today  taxes in the future than they're paying today.
1041	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1042	SANDERS	But in terms of education, this is what I think.
1043	SANDERS	This is the year 2015.
1044	SANDERS	A college degree today, Dana, is the equivalent of what a high school degree was 50 years ago.
1045	SANDERS	And what we said 50 years ago and a hundred years ago is that every kid in this country should be able to get a high school education regardless of the income of their family.
1046	SANDERS	I think we have to say that is true for everybody going to college.
1047	SANDERS	I think we don't need a complicated system, which the secretary is talking about, the income goes down, the income goes down, if you're poor you have to work, and so forth and so on.
1048	SANDERS	I pay for my program, by the way, through a tax on Wall Street speculation, which will not only make public colleges and universities tuitionfree, it will substantially lower interest rates on college debt, a major crisis in this country.
1049	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1050	BASH	And, Secretary Clinton, it's not just college tuition that Senator Sanders is talking about, expanding Social Security and giving all Americans Medicare.
1051	BASH	What's wrong with that?
1052	CLINTON	Well, let me address college affordability, because I have a plan that I think will really zero in on what the problems are.
1053	CLINTON	First, all the 40 million Americans who currently have student debt will be able to refinance their debt to a low interest rate.
1054	CLINTON	That will save thousands of dollars for people who are now struggling under this cumbersome, burdensome college debt.
1055	CLINTON	As a young student in Nevada said to me, the hardest thing about going to college should not be paying for it.
1056	CLINTON	So then we have to make it more affordable.
1057	CLINTON	How do we make it more affordable?
1058	CLINTON	My plan would enable anyone to go to a public college or university tuition free.
1059	CLINTON	You would not have to borrow money for tuition.
1060	CLINTON	But I do believe  and maybe it's because I worked when I went through college I worked when I went through law school  I think it's important for everybody to have some part of getting this accomplished.
1061	CLINTON	That's why I call it a compact.
1062	BASH	Secretary Clinton...
1063	CLINTON	But, yes, I would like students to work 10 hours a week...
1064	BASH	Can you answer the...
1065	SANDERS	... in order to make it possible for them to afford their education.
1066	SANDERS	And I want colleges to get their costs down.
1067	SANDERS	They are outrageously high in what they're charging.
1068	BASH	Secretary Clinton, the question was not just about tuition, though.
1069	BASH	It was about Senator Sanders' plan to expand Social Security, to make Medicare available to all Americans.
1070	BASH	Is that something that you would support?
1071	BASH	And if not, why not?
1072	CLINTON	Well, I fully support Social Security.
1073	CLINTON	And the most important fight we're going to have is defending it against continuing Republican efforts to privatize it.
1074	BASH	Do you want to expand it?
1075	CLINTON	I want to enhance the benefits for the poorest recipients of Social Security.
1076	CLINTON	We have a lot of women on Social Security, particularly widowed and single women who didn't make a lot of money during their careers, and they are impoverished, and they need more help from the Social Security system.
1077	CLINTON	And I will focus  I will focus on helping those people who need it the most.
1078	CLINTON	And of course I'm going to defend Social Security.
1079	CLINTON	I'm going to look for ways to try to make sure it's solvent into the future.
1080	CLINTON	And we also need to talk about health care at some time, because we agree on the goals, we just disagree on the means.
1081	SANDERS	When the Republicans  when the Republicans in the Congress and some Democrats were talking about cutting Social Security and benefits for disabled veterans, for the socalled chained CPI, I founded a caucus called the Defending Social Security Caucus.
1082	SANDERS	My view is that when you have millions of seniors in this country trying to get by  and I don't know how they do on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year  you don't cut Social Security, you expand it.
1083	SANDERS	And the way you expand it is by lifting the cap on taxable incomes so that you do away with the absurdity of a millionaire paying the same amount into the system as somebody making $118,000.
1084	SANDERS	You do that, Social Security is solvent until 2061 and you can expand benefits.
1085	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
1086	COOPER	Senator Sanders, I want to bring it over to Juan Carlos Lopez from CNN en Espanol.
1087	COOPER	We're obviously in Nevada.
1088	COOPER	It's had the highest percentage of undocumented immigrants of any state in the country as of last year.
1089	COOPER	Juan Carlos?
1090	LOPEZ	Gracias, Anderson.
1091	LOPEZ	Senator Sanders, in 2013, you voted for immigration reform.
1092	LOPEZ	But in 2007, when Democrats controlled Congress and the Bush White House was onboard, you voted against it.
1093	LOPEZ	Why should Latino voters trust you now when you left them at the altar at the moment when reform was very close?
1094	SANDERS	I didn't leave anybody at the altar.
1095	SANDERS	I voted against that piece of legislation because it had guestworker provisions in it which the Southern Poverty Law Center talked about being semislavery.
1096	SANDERS	Guest workers are coming in, they're working under terrible conditions, but if they stand up for their rights, they're thrown out of the country.
1097	SANDERS	I was not the only progressive to vote against that legislation for that reason.
1098	SANDERS	Tom Harkin, a very good friend of Hillary Clinton's and mine, one of the leading labor advocates, also voted against that.
1099	LOPEZ	Tom Harkin isn't running for president.
1100	LOPEZ	You are.
1101	SANDERS	I know that.
1102	SANDERS	But point being is that progressives did vote against that for that reason.
1103	SANDERS	My view right now  and always has been  is that when you have 11 million undocumented people in this country, we need comprehensive immigration reform, we need a path toward citizenship, we need to take people out of the shadows.
1104	O'MALLEY	And Juan Carlos  Juan Carlos...
1105	LOPEZ	Secretary Clinton  Secretary Clinton, Governor O'Malley wants to open up Obamacare to millions of undocumented immigrants and their children, including almost 90,000 people right here in Nevada.
1106	LOPEZ	Do you?
1107	CLINTON	Well, first of all, I want to make sure every child gets health care.
1108	CLINTON	That's why I helped to create the Children's Health Insurance Program, and I want to support states that are expanding health care and including undocumented children and others.
1109	CLINTON	I want to open up the opportunity for immigrants to be able to buy in to the exchanges under the Affordable Care Act.
1110	CLINTON	I think to go beyond that, as I understand what Governor O'Malley has recommended, so that they would get the same subsidies.
1111	CLINTON	I think that is  it raises so many issues.
1112	CLINTON	It would be very difficult to administer, it needs to be part of a comprehensive immigration reform, when we finally do get to it.
1113	LOPEZ	Governor O'Malley?
1114	O'MALLEY	Juan Carlos, I think what you've heard up here is some of the old thinking on immigration reform, and that's why it's gridlocked.
1115	O'MALLEY	We need to understand that our country is stronger in every generation by the arrival of new American immigrants.
1116	O'MALLEY	That is why I have put out a policy for comprehensive immigration reform, that is why I would go further than President Obama has on DACA, and DAPA.
1117	O'MALLEY	I mean, we are a nation of immigrants, we are made stronger by immigrants.
1118	O'MALLEY	Do you think for a second that simply because somebody's standing in a broken que on naturalization they're not going to go to the hospital, and that care isn't going to fall on to our insurance rates?
1119	O'MALLEY	I am for a generous, compassionate America that says we're all in this together.
1120	O'MALLEY	We need comprehensive
1121	COOPER	Senator Webb...
1122	O'MALLEY	...immigration reform.
1123	O'MALLEY	It'll make wages go up in America $250 for every year...
1124	LOPEZ	Senator Webb, do you support the undocumented immigrants getting Obamacare?
1125	WEBB	I wouldn't have a problem with that.
1126	WEBB	Let me start by saying my wife is an immigrant.
1127	WEBB	She was a refugee, her family escaped from Vietnam on a boat her entire extended family, after the communists took over, when hundreds of thousands of people were out there and thousands of them were dying.
1128	WEBB	Went to two refugee camps, she never spoke English in her home, and she ended, as I said, graduating from Cornell Law School.
1129	WEBB	That's not only American dream, that's a value that we have with a good immigration system in place.
1130	WEBB	No country has  is a country without defining its borders.
1131	WEBB	We need to resolve this issue.
1132	WEBB	I actually introduced an amendment in the 2007 immigration bill...
1133	LOPEZ	...Thank you, Senator.
1134	WEBB	...Giving a pathway to citizenship to those people who had come here, and put down their roots, and met as a series of standards...
1135	COOPER	...Thank you, Senator.
1136	WEBB	...lost (ph)  I introduced that in 2007  We need a comprehensive reform, and we need to be able to define our borders.
1137	COOPER	Secretary Clinton?

1163	SYSTEM	(CHEERING) (APPLAUSE)
1164	O'MALLEY	Tried to mischaracterize it as free tuition for illegal immigrants.
1165	O'MALLEY	But, we took our case to the people when it was petitioned to referendum, and we won with 58 percent of the vote.
1166	O'MALLEY	The more our children learn, the more they will earn, and that's true of children who have yet to be naturalized...
1167	COOPER	...Senator...
1168	O'MALLEY	...but will become American citizens...
1169	COOPER	Senator Sanders, you talked about your record on the Veteran affairs committee.
1170	COOPER	You served on that committee for the last eight years, including two years as its chairman while veterans died waiting for health care.
1171	COOPER	You and Senator McCain ultimately addressed the issue with bipartisan legislation.
1172	COOPER	Why did it take 18 Inspector General reports, and a CNN investigation, and others, before you and your colleagues took action?
1173	SANDERS	Well, I was chairman for two years, and when I was chairman we did take action.
1174	SANDERS	What we did is pass a $15 billion dollar piece of legislation which brought in many, many new doctors, and nurses into the V.A.
1175	SANDERS	so that veterans in this country could get the health care when they needed it, and not be on long waiting lines.
1176	SANDERS	And, the other part of that legislation said that if a veteran is living more than 40 miles away from a V.A.
1177	SANDERS	facility, that veteran could get health care from the community health center, or the private sector.
1178	SANDERS	As a result of that legislation, we went further in than any time in recent history in improving health care for the men and women of this country who put their lives on the line to defend them.
1179	COOPER	Governor Chafee, you and Hillary Clinton both voted for the Patriot Act which created the NSA surveillance program.
1180	COOPER	You've emphasized civil liberties, privacy during your campaign.
1181	COOPER	Aren't these two things in conflict?
1182	CHAFEE	No, that was another 99 to one vote for the Patriot Act, and it was seen as at the time modernizing our ability to do what we've always done to tap phones which always required a warrant.
1183	CHAFEE	And I voted for that.
1184	COOPER	Do you regret that vote?
1185	CHAFEE	No, no.
1186	CHAFEE	As long as you're getting a warrant, I believe that under the Fourth Amendment, you should be able to do surveillance, but you need a warrant.
1187	CHAFEE	That's what the Fourth Amendment says.
1188	CHAFEE	And in the Patriot Act, section 215 started to get broadened too far.
1189	CHAFEE	So I would be in favor of addressing and reforming section 215 of the Patriot Act.
1190	COOPER	Secretary Clinton, do you regret your vote on the Patriot Act?
1191	CLINTON	No, I don't.
1192	CLINTON	I think that it was necessary to make sure that we were able after 911 to put in place the security that we needed.
1193	CLINTON	And it is true that it did require that there be a process.
1194	CLINTON	What happened, however, is that the Bush administration began to chip away at that process.
1195	CLINTON	And I began to speak out about their use of warrantless surveillance and the other behavior that they engaged in.
1196	CLINTON	We always have to keep the balance of civil liberties, privacy and security.
1197	CLINTON	It's not easy in a democracy, but we have to keep it in mind.
1198	COOPER	Senator  Senator Sanders, you're the only one on this stage who voted against the Patriot Act in 2001...
1199	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1200	SANDERS	It was 99 to one and I was maybe the one.
1201	SANDERS	I don't know.
1202	COOPER	... and the reauthorization votes.
1203	COOPER	Let me ask you, if elected, would you shut down the NSA surveillance program?
1204	SANDERS	I'm sorry?
1205	COOPER	Would you shut down the NSA surveillance program?
1206	SANDERS	Absolutely.
1207	SANDERS	Of course.
1208	COOPER	You would, point blank.
1209	SANDERS	Well, I would shut down  make  I'd shut down what exists right now is that virtually every telephone call in this country ends up in a file at the NSA.
1210	SANDERS	That is unacceptable to me.
1211	SANDERS	But it's not just government surveillance.
1212	SANDERS	I think the government is involved in our emails is involved in our websites.
1213	SANDERS	Corporate America is doing it as well.
1214	SANDERS	If we are a free country, we have the right to be free.
1215	SANDERS	Yes, we have to defend ourselves against terrorism, but there are ways to do that without impinging on our constitutional rights and our privacy rights.
1216	O'MALLEY (?)	Anderson, the NSA...
1217	COOPER	Governor Chafee, Edward Snowden, is he a traitor or a hero?
1218	CHAFEE	No, I would bring him home.
1219	CHAFEE	The courts have ruled that what he did  what he did was say the American...
1220	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
1221	COOPER	Bring him home, no jail time?
1222	CHAFEE	... the American government was acting illegally.
1223	CHAFEE	That's what the federal courts have said what Snowden did showed that the American government was acting illegally for the Fourth Amendment.
1224	CHAFEE	So I would bring him home.
1225	COOPER	Secretary Clinton, hero or traitor?
1226	CLINTON	He broke the laws of the United States.
1227	CLINTON	He could have been a whistleblower.
1228	CLINTON	He could have gotten all of the protections of being a whistleblower.
1229	CLINTON	He could have raised all the issues that he has raised.
1230	CLINTON	And I think there would have been a positive response to that.
1231	COOPER	Should he do jail time?
1232	ClINTON	In addition  in addition, he stole very important information that has unfortunately fallen into a lot of the wrong hands.
1233	ClINTON	So I don't think he should be brought home without facing the music.
1234	COOPER	Governor O'Malley, Snowden?
1235	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1236	O'MALLEY	Anderson, Snowden put a lot of Americans' lives at risk.
1237	O'MALLEY	Snowden broke the law.
1238	O'MALLEY	Whistleblowers do not run to Russia and try to get protection from Putin.
1239	O'MALLEY	If he really believes that, he should be back here.
1240	COOPER	Senator Sanders, Edward Snowden?
1241	SANDERS	I think Snowden played a very important role in educating the American people to the degree in which our civil liberties and our constitutional rights are being undermined.
1242	COOPER	Is he a hero?
1243	SANDERS	He did  he did break the law, and I think there should be a penalty to that.
1244	SANDERS	But I think what he did in educating us should be taken into consideration before he is (inaudible).
1245	COOPER	Senator Webb, Edward Snowden?
1246	WEBB	I  well, I  I would leave his ultimate judgment to the legal system.
1247	WEBB	Here's what I do believe.
1248	WEBB	We have a serious problem in terms of the collection of personal information in this country.
1249	WEBB	And one of the things that I did during the FISA bill in 2007, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, was introduce with Russ Feingold two amendments basically saying, "We understand the realities of how you have to collect this broad information in the Internet age, but after a certain period of time, you need to destroy the personal information that you have if people have not been brought  if criminal justice proceedings have not been brought against them."
1250	WEBB	We've got a vast data bank of information that is ripe for people with bad intentions to be able to use.
1251	WEBB	And they need to be destroyed.
1252	COOPER	Another  another question for each of you, starting with Governor Chafee.
1253	COOPER	Name the one thing  the one way that your administration would not be a third term of President Obama.
1254	CHAFEE	Certainly, ending the wars.
1255	CHAFEE	We've got to stop these wars.
1256	CHAFEE	You have to have a new dynamic, a new paradigm.
1257	CHAFEE	We just spent a halfbillion dollars arming and training soldiers, the rebel soldiers in Syria.
1258	CHAFEE	They quickly join the other side.
1259	CHAFEE	We bombed the...
1260	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
1261	COOPER	President Obama's generals right now are suggesting keeping troops in Afghanistan after the time he wanted them pulled out.
1262	COOPER	Would you keep them there?
1263	CHAFEE	I'd like to finish my question  my answer.
1264	CHAFEE	And also we just bombed a hospital.
1265	CHAFEE	We've had drone strikes that hit civilian weddings.
1266	CHAFEE	So I would change how we  our approach to the Middle East.
1267	CHAFEE	We need a new paradigm in the Middle East.
1268	COOPER	Governor O'Malley, how would you be different than President Obama's administration?
1269	O'MALLEY	I would follow through on the promise that the American people thought we made as Democratic Party, to protect the Main Street economy from recklessness on Wall Street.
1270	O'MALLEY	I would push to separate out these toobigtojail, toobigtofail banks, and put in place GlassSteagall, a modern GlassSteagall that creates a firewall so that this wreckage of our economy can never happen again.
1271	COOPER	Secretary Clinton, how would you not be a third term of President Obama?
1272	CLINTON	Well, I think that's pretty obvious.
1273	CLINTON	I think being the first woman president would be quite a change from the presidents we've had up until this point, including President Obama.
1274	COOPER	Is there a policy difference?
1275	CLINTON	Well, there's a lot that I would like to do to build on the successes of President Obama, but also, as I'm laying out, to go beyond.
1276	CLINTON	And that's in my economic plans, how I would deal with the prescription drug companies, how I would deal with college, how I would deal with a full range of issues that I've been talking about throughout this campaign to go further.
1277	COOPER	Senator Sanders?
1278	SANDERS	I have a lot of respect for president Obama.
1279	SANDERS	I have worked with him time and time again on many, many issues.
1280	SANDERS	But here's where I do disagree.
1281	SANDERS	I believe that the power of corporate America, the power of Wall Street, the power of the drug companies, the power of the corporate media is so great that the only way we really transform America and do the things that the middle class and working class desperately need is through a political revolution when millions of people begin to come together and stand up and say Our government is going to work for all of us, not just a handful of billionaires.
1282	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1283	COOPER	Senator Webb, how would you not be a third term for Obama?
1284	WEBB	I got a great deal of admiration and affection for Senator Sanders, but I  Bernie, I don't think the revolution's going to come.
1285	WEBB	And I don't think the Congress is going to pay for a lot of this stuff.
1286	WEBB	And if there would be a major difference between my administration and the Obama administration, it would be in the use of executive authority.
1287	WEBB	I came up as a committee counsel in the Congress, used to put dozens of bills through the House floor every year as a committee counsel on the Veterans Committee.
1288	WEBB	I have a very strong feeling about how our federal system works and how we need to lead and energize the congressional process instead of allowing these divisions to continue to paralyze what we're doing.
1289	WEBB	So I would lead  working with both parties in the Congress and working through them in the traditional way that our Constitution sets (ph).
1290	COOPER	Senator Sanders, he cited you.
1291	COOPER	You don't hear a lot of Democratic presidential candidates talking about revolution.
1292	COOPER	What do you mean?
1293	SANDERS	What I mean is that we need to have one of the larger voter turnouts in the world, not one of the lowest.
1294	SANDERS	We need to raise public consciousness.
1295	SANDERS	We need the American people to know what's going on in Washington in a way that today they do not know.
1296	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1297	SANDERS	And when people come together in a way that does not exist now and are prepared to take on the big money interest, then we could bring the kind of change we need.
1298	O'MALLEY	Anderson, I actually have talked about a revolution.
1299	O'MALLEY	What we need is a green energy revolution.
1300	O'MALLEY	We need to move America to a 100 percent clean electric grid by 2050 and create 5 million jobs along the way.
1301	COOPER	And we want to  and we're going to talk more about climate change and environmental issues coming up.
1302	COOPER	Some of the candidates have tried marijuana, as have pretty much  probably everybody in this room.
1303	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
1304	COOPER	Others have not.
1305	COOPER	Does that influence  does it influence their views on legalization?
1306	COOPER	Find out that and others ahead.
1307	SYSTEM	(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
1308	COOPER	And welcome back to this CNN Democratic presidential debate.
1309	COOPER	It has been quite a night so far.
1310	COOPER	We are in the final block of this debate.
1311	COOPER	All the candidates are back, which I'm very happy to see.
1312	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
1313	COOPER	It's a long story.
1314	COOPER	Let's continue, shall we?
1315	COOPER	Secretary Clinton, welcome back.
1316	CLINTON	Well, thank you.
1317	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
1318	CLINTON	You know, it does take me a little longer.
1319	CLINTON	That's all I can say.
1320	COOPER	That's right.
1321	COOPER	Secretary Clinton, Governor O'Malley says the presidency is not a crown to be passed back and forth between two royal families.
1322	COOPER	This year has been the year of the outsider in politics, just ask Bernie Sanders.
1323	COOPER	Why should Democrats embrace an insider like yourself?
1324	CLINTON	Well, I can't think of anything more of an outsider than electing the first woman president, but I'm not just running because I would be the first woman president.
1325	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1326	CLINTON	I'm running because I have a lifetime of experience in getting results and fighting for people, fighting for kids, for women, for families, fighting to even the odds.
1327	CLINTON	And I know what it takes to get things done.
1328	CLINTON	I know how to find common ground and I know how to stand my ground.
1329	CLINTON	And I think we're going to need both of those in Washington to get anything that we're talking about up here accomplished.
1330	CLINTON	So I'm very happy that I have both the commitment of a lifetime and the experience of a lifetime to bring together to offer the American people.
1331	COOPER	Governor O'Malley, do you want to tell Secretary Clinton why she shouldn't get the crown?
1332	O'MALLEY	Well, actually, you know, we had this conversation.
1333	O'MALLEY	And I will share with you that I've traveled all around the country, Anderson, and there's two phrases I keep hearing again and again and again.
1334	O'MALLEY	And they're the phrases "new leadership" and "getting things done."
1335	O'MALLEY	We cannot be this dissatisfied with our gridlocked national politics and an economy where 70 percent of us are earning the same or less than we were 12 years ago, and think that a resort to old names is going to move us forward.
1336	O'MALLEY	I respect what Secretary Clinton and her husband have done for our country.
1337	O'MALLEY	But our country needs new leadership to move forward.
1338	COOPER	Secretary Clinton, you have to be able to respond, if you want.
1339	CLINTON	Well, I would not ask anyone to vote for me based on my last name.
1340	CLINTON	I would ask them to listen to what I'm proposing, look at what I've accomplished in the Senate, as secretary of of state, and then draw your own conclusion.
1341	CLINTON	I certainly am not campaigning to become president because my last name is Clinton.
1342	CLINTON	I'm campaigning because I think I have the right combination of what the country needs, at this point, and I think I can take the fight to the Republicans, because we cannot afford a Republican to succeed Barack Obama as president of the United States.
1343	COOPER	(inaudible).
1344	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1345	COOPER	Senator Sanders, does she have the right stuff?
1346	SANDERS	I think  I think that there is profound frustration all over this country with establishment politics.
1347	SANDERS	I am the only candidate running for president who is not a billionaire, who has raised substantial sums of money, and I do not have a super PAC.
1348	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1349	SANDERS	I am not raising money from millionaires and billionaires, and in fact, tonight, in terms of what a political revolution is about, there are 4,000 house parties  100,000 people in this country  watching this debate tonight who want real change in this country.
1350	COOPER	we've got  we  a lot of questions we've got about climate change, and we're gonna go to Don Lemon.
1351	COOPER	Don?
1352	LEMON	All right.
1353	LEMON	This one is for Martin O'Malley.
1354	LEMON	Anderson, Governor O'Malley, this is from Anna Bettis from Tempe, Arizona.
1355	LEMON	Here it is.
1356	SYSTEM	(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
1357	QUESTION	As a young person, I'm very concerned about climate change and how it will affect my future.
1358	QUESTION	As a presidential candidate, what will you do to address climate change?
1359	SYSTEM	(END VIDEO CLIP)
1360	LEMON	So, Governor O'Malley, please tell Anna how you would protect the environment better than all the other candidates up on that stage.
1361	O'MALLEY	Yeah.
1362	O'MALLEY	Anna, I have put forward a plan  and I'm the only candidate, I believe, in either party to do this  to move America forward to a 100 percent clean electric grid by 2050.
1363	O'MALLEY	We did not land a man on the moon with an alloftheabove strategy.
1364	O'MALLEY	It was an intentional engineering challenge, and we solved it as a nation.
1365	O'MALLEY	And our nation must solve this one.
1366	O'MALLEY	So I put forward the plan that would extend the investor tax credits for solar and for wind.
1367	O'MALLEY	If you go across Iowa, you see that 30 percent of their energy now comes from wind.
1368	O'MALLEY	We're here in Las Vegas, one of the most sustainable cities in America, doing important things in terms of green building, architecture and design.
1369	O'MALLEY	We can get there as a nation, but it's going to require presidential leadership.
1370	O'MALLEY	And as president, I intend to sign as my very first order in office the  an order that moves us as a nation and dedicates our resources to solving this problem and moving us to a 100 percent clean electric grid by 2050.
1371	COOPER	Governor...
1372	O'MALLEY	We can do it.
1373	COOPER	...Governor O'Malley, thank you very much.
1374	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1375	COOPER	Senator Webb, you have a very different view than just about anybody else on this stage, and unlike a lot of Democrats.
1376	COOPER	You're procoal, you're prooffshore drilling, you're proKeystone pipeline.
1377	COOPER	Are  again, are you  the question is, are you out of step with the Democratic party?
1378	WEBB	Well, the  the question really is how are we going to solve energy problems here and in the global environment if you really want to address climate change?
1379	WEBB	And when I was in the Senate, I was an alloftheabove energy voter.
1380	WEBB	We introduced legislation to bring in alternate energy as well as nuclear power.
1381	WEBB	I'm a strong proponent of nuclear power.
1382	WEBB	It is safe, it is clean.
1383	WEBB	And really, we are not going to solve climate change simply with the laws here.
1384	WEBB	We've done a good job in this country since 1970.
1385	WEBB	If you look at China and India, they're the greatest polluters in the world.
1386	WEBB	Fifteen out of the 20 most polluted cities in the world are in one of those two countries.
1387	WEBB	We need to solve this in a global way.
1388	WEBB	It's a global problem and I have been very strong on  on doing that.
1389	WEBB	The  the agreements  the socalled agreements that we have had with China are illusory in terms of the immediate requirements of the  of the Chinese government itself.
1390	WEBB	So let's solve this problem in an international way, and then we really will have a  a way to address climate change.
1391	COOPER	Senator Sanders, are you tougher on  on climate change than Secretary Clinton?
1392	SANDERS	Well, I will tell you this.
1393	SANDERS	I believe  and Pope Francis made this point.
1394	SANDERS	This is a moral issue.
1395	SANDERS	The scientists are telling us that we need to move extremely boldly.
1396	SANDERS	I am proud that, along with Senator Barbara Boxer, a few years ago, we introduced the first piece of climate change legislation which called for a tax on carbon.
1397	SANDERS	And let me also tell you that nothing is gonna happen unless we are prepared to deal with campaign finance reform, because the fossil fuel industry is funding the Republican Party, which denies the reality of climate change...
1398	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1399	SANDERS	...and certainly is not prepared to go forward aggressively.
1400	SANDERS	This is a moral issue.
1401	SANDERS	We have got to be extremely aggressive in working with China, India, Russia.
1402	COOPER	Senator  thank you, Senator.
1403	SANDERS	The planet  the future of the planet is at stake.
1404	COOPER	Secretary Clinton, I want you to be able to respond, then I'm gonna go to (ph) (inaudible).
1405	CLINTON	Well, that  that's exactly what I've been doing.
1406	CLINTON	When we met in Copenhagen in 2009 and, literally, President Obama and I were hunting for the Chinese, going throughout this huge convention center, because we knew we had to get them to agree to something.
1407	CLINTON	Because there will be no effective efforts against climate change unless China and India join with the rest of the world.
1408	CLINTON	They told us they'd left for the airport we found out they were having a secret meeting.
1409	CLINTON	We marched up, we broke in, we said, "We've been looking all over for you.
1410	CLINTON	Let's sit down and talk about what we need to do."
1411	CLINTON	And we did come up with the first international agreement that China has signed.
1412	CLINTON	Thanks to President Obama's leadership, it's now gone much further.
1413	COOPER	Thank you.
1414	CLINTON	And I do think that the bilateral agreement that President Obama made with the Chinese was significant.
1415	CLINTON	Now, it needs to go further, and there will be an international meeting at the end of this year, and we must get verifiable commitments to fight climate change from every country gathered there.
1416	COOPER	Dana Bash?
1417	BASH	Secretary Clinton, you now support mandated paid family leave.
1418	CLINTON	Mmhmm.
1419	BASH	Carly Fiorina, the first female CEO of a Fortune 50 company, argues, if the government requires paid leave, it will force small businesses to, quote, "hire fewer people and create fewer jobs."
1420	BASH	What do you say not only to Carly Fiorina, but also a smallbusiness owner out there who says, you know, I like this idea, but I just can't afford it?
1421	CLINTON	Well, I'm surprised she says that, because California has had a paid leave program for a number of years.
1422	CLINTON	And it's...
1423	BASH	It's on the federal level.
1424	CLINTON	Well, but all  well, on a state level, a state as big as many countries in the world.
1425	CLINTON	And it has not had the ill effects that the Republicans are always saying it will have.
1426	CLINTON	And I think this is  this is typical Republican scare tactics.
1427	CLINTON	We can design a system and pay for it that does not put the burden on small businesses.
1428	CLINTON	I remember as a young mother, you know, having a baby wake up who was sick and I'm supposed to be in court, because I was practicing law.
1429	CLINTON	I know what it's like.
1430	CLINTON	And I think we need to recognize the incredible challenges that so many parents face, particularly working moms.
1431	CLINTON	I see my good friend, Senator Gillibrand, in the front row.
1432	CLINTON	She's been a champion of this.
1433	CLINTON	We need to get a consensus through this campaign, which is why I'm talking about it everywhere I go, and we need to join the rest of the advanced world in having it.
1434	BASH	But Secretary  Secretary Clinton, even many people who agree with you might say, look, this is very hard to do, especially in today's day and age.
1435	BASH	There are so many people who say, "Really?
1436	BASH	Another government program?
1437	BASH	Is that what you're proposing?
1438	BASH	And at the expense of taxpayer money?"
1439	CLINTON	Well, look, you know, when people say that  it's always the Republicans or their sympathizers who say, "You can't have paid leave, you can't provide health care."
1440	CLINTON	They don't mind having big government to interfere with a woman's right to choose and to try to take down Planned Parenthood.
1441	CLINTON	They're fine with big government when it comes to that.
1442	CLINTON	I'm sick of it.
1443	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1444	CLINTON	You know, we can do these things.
1445	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1446	CLINTON	We should not be paralyzed  we should not be paralyzed by the Republicans and their constant refrain, "big government this, big government that," that except for what they want to impose on the American people.
1447	CLINTON	I know we can afford it, because we're going to make the wealthy pay for it.
1448	CLINTON	That is the way to get it done.
1449	COOPER	Thank you.
1450	COOPER	Senator Sanders?
1451	SANDERS	Yeah, Dana, here's the point Every other major country on Earth, every one, including some small countries, say that when a mother has a baby, she should stay home with that baby.
1452	SANDERS	We are the only major country.
1453	SANDERS	That is an international embarrassment that we do not provide family  paid family and medical leave.
1454	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1455	SANDERS	Second of all, the secretary is right.
1456	SANDERS	Republicans tell us we can't do anything except give tax breaks to billionaires and cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.
1457	SANDERS	That's not what the American people want.
1458	COOPER	Governor O'Malley?
1459	O'MALLEY	Anderson, in our state, we actually expanded family leave.
1460	O'MALLEY	And I have to agree with Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders.
1461	O'MALLEY	Look, the genius of our nation is that we find ways in every generation to include more of our people more fully in the economic life of our country, and we need to do that for our families, and especially so that women aren't penalized in having to drop out of the workforce.
1462	O'MALLEY	My wife, Katie, is here with our four kids.
1463	O'MALLEY	And, man, that was a juggle when we had little kids and  and keeping jobs and moving forwards.
1464	O'MALLEY	We would be a stronger nation economically if we had paid family leave.
1465	COOPER	Governor, thank you.
1466	COOPER	The issue now, particularly in this state, is recreational marijuana.
1467	COOPER	I want to go to Juan Carlos Lopez.
1468	LOPEZ	Thank you, Anderson.
1469	LOPEZ	Senator Sanders, right here in Nevada, there will be a measure to legalize recreational marijuana on the 2016 ballot.
1470	LOPEZ	You've said you smoked marijuana twice it didn't quite work for you.
1471	LOPEZ	If you were a Nevada resident, how would you vote?
1472	SANDERS	I suspect I would vote yes.
1473	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1474	SANDERS	And I would vote yes because I am seeing in this country too many lives being destroyed for nonviolent offenses.
1475	SANDERS	We have a criminal justice system that lets CEOs on Wall Street walk away, and yet we are imprisoning or giving jail sentences to young people who are smoking marijuana.
1476	SANDERS	I think we have to think through this war on drugs...
1477	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1478	SANDERS	...which has done an enormous amount of damage.
1479	SANDERS	We need to rethink our criminal justice system, we we've got a lot of work to do in that area.
1480	O'MALLEY	Juan Carlos?
1481	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1482	LOPEZ	Secretary Clinton, you told Christiane Amanpour you didn't smoke pot when you were young, and you're not going to start now.
1483	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
1484	LOPEZ	When asked about legalizing recreational marijuana, you told her let's wait and see how it plays out in Colorado and Washington.
1485	LOPEZ	It's been more than a year since you've said that.
1486	LOPEZ	Are you ready to take a position tonight?
1487	CLINTON	No.
1488	CLINTON	I think that we have the opportunity through the states that are pursuing recreational marijuana to find out a lot more than we know today.
1489	CLINTON	I do support the use of medical marijuana, and I think even there we need to do a lot more research so that we know exactly how we're going to help people for whom medical marijuana provides relief.
1490	CLINTON	So, I think we're just at the beginning, but I agree completely with the idea that we have got to stop imprisoning people who use marijuana.
1491	CLINTON	Therefore, we need more states, cities, and the federal government to begin to address this so that we don't have this terrible result that Senator Sanders was talking about where we have a huge population in our prisons for nonviolent, lowlevel offenses that are primarily due to marijuana.
1492	COOPER	Secretary Clinton, thank you.
1493	COOPER	I want to go to Don Lemon with another Facebook question.
1494	LEMON	Alright, Anderson.
1495	LEMON	This is for Senator Sanders, OK?
1496	LEMON	This is from Carrie (ph) Kang (ph) from Manassas, Virginia, would like would like to ask the Senator, "President Obama has had a difficult time getting Republicans to compromise on just about every agenda.
1497	LEMON	How will you approach this going forward, and will it be any different?"
1498	LEMON	Senator?
1499	SANDERS	The Republican party, since I've been in the Senate, and since President Obama has been in office, has played a terrible, terrible role of being total obstructionists.
1500	SANDERS	Every effort that he has made, that some of us have made, they have said no, no, no.
1501	SANDERS	Now, in my view, the only way we can take on the right wing republicans who are, by the way, I hope will not continue to control the Senate and the House when one of us elected President...
1502	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1503	SANDERS	...But the only way we can get things done is by having millions of people coming together.
1504	SANDERS	If we want free tuition at public colleges and universities, millions of young people are going to have to demand it, and give the Republicans an offer they can't refuse.
1505	SANDERS	If we want to raise the minimum wage to $15 bucks an hour, workers are going to have to come together and look the Republicans in the eye, and say, "We know what's going on.
1506	SANDERS	You vote against us, you are out of your job."
1507	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1508	COOPER	We're going to hear from all the candidates coming up.
1509	COOPER	We're going to take a short break.
1510	COOPER	More from the candidates in a moment.
1511	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1512	SYSTEM	[ commercial break ]
1513	COOPER	And welcome back to the final round of the CNN Democratic presidential debate.
1514	COOPER	This is a question to each of you.
1515	COOPER	Each of you, by the way, are going to have closing statements to make.
1516	COOPER	Each of you will have 90 seconds.
1517	COOPER	But a final question to each of you.
1518	COOPER	If you can, just try to  15 seconds if you can.
1519	COOPER	Governor Chafee, Franklin Delano Roosevelt once said, "I ask you to judge me by the enemies I have made."
1520	COOPER	You've all made a few people upset over your political careers.
1521	COOPER	Which enemy are you most proud of?
1522	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
1523	CHAFEE	I guess the coal lobby.
1524	CHAFEE	I've worked hard for climate change and I want to work with the coal lobby.
1525	CHAFEE	But in my time in the Senate, tried to bring them to the table so that we could address carbon dioxide.
1526	CHAFEE	I'm proud to be at odds with the coal lobby.
1527	COOPER	Governor O'Malley?
1528	O'MALLEY	The National Rifle Association.
1529	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1530	COOPER	Secretary Clinton?
1531	CLINTON	Well, in addition to the NRA, the health insurance companies, the drug companies, the Iranians.
1532	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
1533	CLINTON	Probably the Republicans.
1534	SYSTEM	[ laughter and applause ]
1535	COOPER	Senator Sanders?
1536	SANDERS	As someone who has taken on probably every special interest that there is in Washington, I would lump Wall Street and the pharmaceutical industry at the top of my life of people who do not like me.
1537	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1538	COOPER	Senator Webb?
1539	WEBB	I'd have to say the enemy soldier that threw the grenade that wounded me, but he's not around right now to talk to.
1540	COOPER	All right.
1541	COOPER	Time for closing statements.
1542	COOPER	Each of you will have 90 seconds.
1543	COOPER	Governor Chafee, let's begin with you.
1544	CHAFEE	Thank you, Anderson.
1545	CHAFEE	Thank you, CNN.
1546	CHAFEE	And thank you, Facebook, for sponsoring this debate.
1547	CHAFEE	America has many challenges confronting us  ending the perpetual wars, addressing climate change, addressing income inequality, funding education, funding infrastructure, funding healthcare, helping black Americans, helping Native Americans.
1548	CHAFEE	We have many challenges.
1549	CHAFEE	Who is best able to confront these challenges?
1550	CHAFEE	I've served in government at many levels.
1551	CHAFEE	I know what it's like to solve problems at the local level because I did it as mayor.
1552	CHAFEE	I know how to get legislation passed through Congress because I did it as a senator.
1553	CHAFEE	I know how to turn around a state because I did as governor of Rhode Island.
1554	CHAFEE	But what I'm most proud of is that in 30 years of public service, I have had no scandals.
1555	CHAFEE	I have high ethical standards.
1556	CHAFEE	And what I'm most proud of is my judgment, particularly in the Iraq war vote.
1557	CHAFEE	There was a lot of pressure  political pressure, public pressure.
1558	CHAFEE	But I did my homework and I did not believe that the evidence was there that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.
1559	CHAFEE	And we live now with the consequences.
1560	CHAFEE	So that kind of judgment is what we want in a president going forward.
1561	CHAFEE	And I'm running for president to end the wars.
1562	CHAFEE	I want to be the peacemaker.
1563	CHAFEE	I am a proven peacemaker.
1564	CHAFEE	Please go to Chafee 2016 to learn more about me.
1565	CHAFEE	Thank you.
1566	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1567	COOPER	Governor Chafee, thank you very much.
1568	COOPER	Senator Webb, your final statement for 90 seconds.
1569	WEBB	Thank you.
1570	WEBB	Ladies and gentlemen, it's been a pleasure to be with you tonight.
1571	WEBB	You've heard a lot of promises up here you've heard a lot of rhetoric.
1572	WEBB	They all seem to happen during campaigns, and then once the election's over, people start from scratch again and try to get things done.
1573	WEBB	One of the things I can promise you, if you look at my record, in and out of government, is that I've always been willing to take on a complicated, something unpopular issues, and work them through, the complex issues, and work them through in order to have the solution.
1574	WEBB	We did it with criminal justice reform.
1575	WEBB	We've had a lot of discussion here about criminal justice reform.
1576	WEBB	We did it in other ways.
1577	WEBB	We need a national political strategy for our economy, for our social policy, for social justice, and, by the way, for how you run and manage the most complex bureaucracy in the world, which is the federal government.
1578	WEBB	I know how to lead.
1579	WEBB	I did it in Vietnam, I did it in the Pentagon, I did it in the Senate, and if you will help me overcome this cavalcade of  of financial irregularities and money that is poisoning our political process, I am ready to do that for you in the White House.
1580	COOPER	Senator Webb, thank you very much.
1581	COOPER	Governor O'Malley, you have 90 seconds.
1582	O'MALLEY	Anderson, thank you.
1583	O'MALLEY	I am very, very grateful to have been able to be on this stage with this distinguished group of candidates tonight.
1584	O'MALLEY	And what you heard tonight, Anderson, was a very, very  and all of you watching at home  was a very, very different debate than from the sort of debate you heard from the two presidential Republican debates.
1585	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1586	O'MALLEY	On this stage  on this stage, you didn't hear anyone denigrate women, you didn't hear anyone make racist comments about new American immigrants, you didn't hear anyone speak ill of another American because of their religious belief.
1587	O'MALLEY	What you heard instead on this stage tonight was an honest search for the answers that will move our country forward, to move us to a 100 percent clean electric energy grid by 2050, to take the actions that we have always taken as Americans so that we can actually attack injustice in our country, employ more of our people, rebuild our cities and towns, educate our children at higher and better levels, and include more of our people in the economic, social, and political life of our country.
1588	O'MALLEY	I truly believe that we are standing on the threshold of a new era of American progress.
1589	O'MALLEY	Unless you've become discouraged about our gridlock in Congress, talk to our young people under 30, because you'll never find among them people that want to bash immigrants or people that want to deny rights to gay couples.
1590	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1591	O'MALLEY	That tells me we are moving to a more connected, generous, and compassionate place, and we need to speak to the goodness within our country.
1592	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1593	COOPER	Governor O'Malley, thank you very much.
1594	COOPER	Senator Sanders, final, closing thoughts, 90 seconds.
1595	SANDERS	This is a great country, but we have many, many serious problems.
1596	SANDERS	We should not be the country that has the highest rate of childhood poverty of any major country and more wealth and income inequality than any other country.
1597	SANDERS	We should not be the only major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all of our people as a right of citizenship and we should not be the only major country that does not provide medical and  and parental leave  family and parental leave to all of our families.
1598	SANDERS	Now, at the end of our day, here is the truth that very few candidates will say, is that nobody up here, certainly no Republican, can address the major crises facing our country unless millions of people begin to stand up to the billionaire class that has so much power over our economy and our political life.
1599	SANDERS	Jim Webb is right Money is pouring in to this campaign through super PACs.
1600	SANDERS	We are doing it the oldfashioned way 650,000 individual contributions.
1601	SANDERS	And if people want to help us out, BernieSanders.com.
1602	SANDERS	We are averaging $30 bucks apiece.
1603	SANDERS	We would appreciate your help.
1604	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1605	COOPER	Secretary Clinton?
1606	CLINTON	Thank you very much, Anderson.
1607	CLINTON	And thanks to all the viewers who tuned in tonight.
1608	CLINTON	I think what you did see is that, in this debate, we tried to deal with some of the very tough issues facing our country.
1609	CLINTON	That's in stark contrast to the Republicans who are currently running for president.
1610	CLINTON	What you have to ask yourself is Who amongst us has the vision for actually making the changes that are going to improve the lives of the American people?
1611	CLINTON	Who has the tenacity and the ability and the proven track record of getting that done?
1612	CLINTON	Now, I revere my late mother, and she gave me a lot of good advice.
1613	CLINTON	But one of the best pieces of advice she gave me was, you know, the issue is not whether or not you get knocked down.
1614	CLINTON	It's whether you get back up.
1615	CLINTON	America's been knocked down.
1616	CLINTON	That Great Recession, 9 million people lost their jobs, 5 million lost their homes, $13 trillion in wealth disappeared.
1617	CLINTON	And although we've made progress, we're standing but not running the way America needs to.
1618	CLINTON	My mission as president will be to raise incomes for hardworking middleclass families and to make sure that we get back to the basic bargain I was raised with If you work hard and you do your part, you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead.
1619	CLINTON	Please join me in this campaign.
1620	CLINTON	Please come and make it clear that America's best days are still ahead.
1621	CLINTON	Thank you very much.
1622	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1623	COOPER	Well, that does it for this Democratic presidential debate.
1624	COOPER	On behalf of everyone at CNN, we want to thank the candidates, our debate partners at Facebook, the Wynn Resort, and the Democratic National Committee.
1625	COOPER	Thanks also to Dana Bash, Juan Carlos Lopez, and Don Lemon.

1627	COOPER	That will be moderated by my colleague, Wolf Blitzer.
