So has opposition, in part from downtown hotels concerned that any public subsidies could unfairly undercut their businesses.\nMomentum surged again early last year behind a project calling for a 600-room hotel that would be privately owned and operated. Metro, the regional planning government, asked developers for proposals in February 2012 and spelled out only a relatively small public investment -- a $4 million loan from the Portland Development Commission.\n\"We recognized there were limits to other potential (public) financing tools, and we didn\u2019t know what that number would look like,\" said Teri Dresler, general manager of Metro\u2019s visitor venues, such as the Oregon Zoo. \"We wanted developers to tell us: What are you willing to invest?\"\nOf the two proposals submitted, Metro chose Mortenson/Hyatt\u2019s to move ahead. But opponents remain frustrated, saying they were shut out of what should be a far more open process and what ended up as being a much more lucrative deal.\nOne of the opponents\u2019 claims, published on the website of OUCH \u00a0-- (\"Our Unfortunate Convention Hotel\") caught our eye: \"Taxpayer subsidy for OCC hotel jumps $100 million in closed-door sessions. $8 million to $130 million with zero public input. OUCH, that hurts.\"\nPolitiFact Oregon decided to see whether a $197.5 million project rolled out as minimalist in public investment ended up getting significant subsidies in \"closed-door sessions.\"\nWe called Bashar Wali, president of Provenance Hotels, who belongs to the group fearing that public subsidies could unfairly tip the market toward a new Hyatt Regency. Wali, it should be noted, served on the committee that ultimately recommended that Metro go with Mortenson/Hyatt\u2019s proposal.\nEarly on, he said, the amount of public money committed to the project began rising. It started with the $4 million PDC loan, then doubled to the $8 million cited on OUCH\u2019s website when Metro agreed to chip in a $4 million grant.\nBut almost as soon as Minneapolis-based Mortenson Development was selected to build the hotel, Wali said, three things happened: The committee was disbanded, communication to outsiders stopped, and the public commitment to the project swelled.\nHe cited a $10 million commitment of lottery proceeds approved this year by the Oregon Legislature. Then Metro upped the ante by agreeing to sell $60 million in revenue bonds to aid construction. The total project cost of the bonds, including interest, is $121 million over the 30-year life of the bonds, according to a Metro fact sheet.\n\"And all of the negotiations between Metro and Hyatt have been conducted in secret,\" said Wali, who belongs to the Coalition for Fair Budget Priorities that opposes the project. \"The transparency Metro promised has simply not been there.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTim Knopp\n\n\nstated on February 12, 2013 in a press release\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnopp says he upheld a campaign promise not to join the Public Employees Retirement System (PERS).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Janie Har \u2022 February 23, 2013\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetro\u2019s Dresler responded to both of Wali\u2019s main points. Yes, she acknowledged, negotiations between Metro staff and Mortenson/Hyatt team members have been conducted in what OUCH characterized as \"closed-door sessions.\"\n\"But real estate transactions are always conducted that way,\" she said. \"Often, there are trade secrets being discussed, things that companies such as Hyatt want protected until any deal is signed and delivered.\"\nShe got agreement on that point from Tim Ramis, a Portland attorney whose firm has helped represent downtown hotels opposing the deal. \"The negotiation aspect of this is typical to the way these things are usually handled,\" he said, adding that, \"What\u2019s unusual is that the outcome isn\u2019t being disclosed.\"\nThe amount of public money involved has definitely increased from Metro\u2019s original request for proposals, Dresler said, but that was always a possibility. We tracked the document down. In the \"Public Investment and Resources\" section, it reads, \"Metro and its partners recognize that some level of public investment may be necessary to achieve the type of convention hotel required by this\" request for proposals.\nAmong the financing options listed is Metro\u2019s willingness \"to consider additional\" monetary support and \"site-specific transient lodging taxes \u2018rebated\u2019 to the project for a period of years.\"\nThe latter -- more commonly known as room taxes -- are what Metro plans to use to pay off the $60 million in revenue bonds, Dresler said. The figure was chosen, she added, not based on what Mortenson requested but on the gap between construction cost and the revenue consultants said the hotel could generate over the next 30 years.\nFinally, Dresler said, the $60 million in bonds shouldn\u2019t be regarded as a public subsidy since it will be paid off entirely using money plunked down by conventioneers staying at the new hotel.\nOUCH\u2019s claim rests on two pillars -- a $100-million jump in taxpayer subsidy in \"closed-door sessions.\"\nOn the first point, all agree that at least $18 million in public money is on the table: a $4 million PDC loan, a $4 million Metro grant and $10 million in Oregon Lottery proceeds.\nSo should the $60 million in revenue bonds be considered a public subsidy? We called Robert Whelan, senior economist at ECONorthwest, who said yes. We also referred to a recent New York Times financial article, in which analysts say such bonds amount to public subsidies because they divert money that could otherwise go toward public projects to help pay for a private project.\nThe ultimate projections dance around a bit, given the 30-year pay-off period at stake, but even Metro agrees that the bond sale will end up requiring about $121 million to satisfy. So we find that OUCH is on the mark in stating that the total public stake involved grew substantially, at least in specifically outlined amounts, from the original request for proposals.\nAll also agree that the negotiations took place behind closed doors. Some opponents think that was improper or unfair, though others agree that real estate negotiations between public agencies and private developers are routinely held in private. But that\u2019s a separate issue. So we also find OUCH accurate on that point.\nWe rate the statement on OUCH\u2019s website True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08642"}
