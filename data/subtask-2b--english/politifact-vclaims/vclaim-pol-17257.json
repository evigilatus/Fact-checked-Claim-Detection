Which one of these lying stories did you want us to pretend is true?\" Mindy Robinson, a conservative actress who lost a recent congressional run in Nevada, wrote on Twitter.\u00a0\nRobinson\u2019s tweet, which was re-shared on Facebook, includes screenshots of two different articles.\u00a0\nOne depicts a Dec. 8 BBC article that shows Keenan getting the shot, while the other appears to show an unrelated story by CNN published on Oct. 22, with the same images of Keenan receiving the vaccine.\nBut this is a misunderstanding of how some news websites, like CNN\u2019s, will sometimes display the latest stories at the top of other, unrelated articles. Keenan is not an actor, and CNN did not publish photos of her receiving the vaccine in October.\nAnother post on Facebook also ambiguously claims that Keenan is a crisis actor because she apparently made a hand gesture that has been connected to the Illuminati, and by including screenshots of another, unnamed woman who is supposedly an actress.\nThere is no evidence that the images of the woman (or women, the grainy screenshot isn\u2019t clear and may show\u00a0more than one person) pictured is Keenan, or that her innocuous hand gesture signals something nefarious.\nThe posts\u00a0were\u00a0flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

It does not include any images of Keenan.\u00a0\nSome article pages on CNN\u2019s website display videos from other stories, often the most recent ones, underneath the headline. A reel showing a handful of videos, which currently includes the Dec. 8 vaccinations in the UK, is displayed under that.\nThese clips were not published at the same time as the Oct. 22 article, but simply feature other CNN segments that viewers can watch if they want.\nMany conspiracy theories latch onto the flawed claim that people who appear in various news stories \u2014 often tragic events like mass shootings \u2014 are actually paid actors pushing a pre-ordained narrative. These types of theories have been, and continue to be, soundly debunked.\nRELATED: PolitiFact\u2019s 2018 Lie of the Year: Online smear machine tries to take down Parkland students\u00a0\nOur ruling\nA social media post claims that images of Margaret Keenan receiving the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine in the UK appeared in a CNN news story in October, despite the event taking place in early December.\nThis is wrong. Images of Keenan receiving the vaccine were not published in earlier articles by CNN, or any other news organization. They were taken on Dec. 8, and do not appear online before then.\nThose who spread the post misunderstood that some news websites, including CNN\u2019s, feature clips of other, unrelated stories on various article pages.\nThis is False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17257"}
