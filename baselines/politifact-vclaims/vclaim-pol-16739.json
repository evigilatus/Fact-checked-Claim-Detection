Kamala Harris attacking supporters of President Donald Trump has been widely shared on social media. But it\u2019s made-up.\nThe quote, which was published Oct. 29\u00a0 and Nov. 2 on Facebook, makes it look like Harris, a Democratic senator running for president in 2020, threatened people who voted for Trump in 2016.\nThe quote reads: \"And once he\u2019s gone and we have regained our rightful place in the White House, look out if you supported him and endorsed his actions, because we\u2019ll be coming for you next. You will feel the vengeance of a nation. No stone will be left unturned as we seek you out in every corner of this great nation. For it is you who have betrayed us.\"\nThe post, which has been shared more than 700 times, was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

But the popular Facebook quote is fake.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.

Warriorcode.us is a website that sells pro-gun apparel. One of the site\u2019s Facebook pages published the same photo Oct. 24. It later edited the post to acknowledge that the quote was made-up.\nIt appears the post originated in an Aug. 7 story from Bustatroll.org, a satirical site known for publishing made-up political stories. Its owner, Christopher Blair, operates several similar sites with the goal of fooling conservatives into sharing bogus content.\nThe article fabricated a speech in which Harris said she would round up Trump supporters if Democrats won the White House in 2020. We could find no evidence that Harris ever made such a speech.\nWhile the Bustatroll.org story includes several disclosures that its content is satirical, the Facebook post does not. Commenters took the quote at face value.\nThe Facebook post is inaccurate and makes a ridiculous claim. We rate it Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16739"}
