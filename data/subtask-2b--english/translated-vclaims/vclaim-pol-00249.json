The California Senator then said up to 300,000 car workers were expected to lose their jobs this year, indicating that Trump was in charge. \"Donald Trump betrayed a lot of people. In his post, he made all kinds of promises to workers, from farmers to car workers, \"Harris said at the CNN interview on August 12th. \"He was going to help working people, and it is estimated that up to 300,000 car workers may be unemployed before the end of the year.\" The trade policy pursued by Tramp, especially the tariffs imposed on China, is blamed by economists for harming farmers. But is it really expected that up to 300,000 car workers will lose their jobs by the end of this year, as Harris claimed? Two recent fact checks made this figure questionable. We will review the facts and classify the Senator's allegations. After the interview, Harris CNN's campaign told NN that the 300,000 copies of a study he conducted in February were made by the Car Research Centre, CAR. The research team examined the impact of the proposed 25 per cent trump tariff on all imported cars and spare parts except Canada, Mexico and South Korea. It is estimated that between 70,000 and 367 thousand jobs will be lost in all sectors of the American economy, but not specifically among car workers, under the \"worst scenario.\" In May, Trump was delayed for six months in deciding on the imposition of tariffs. Christine Dzik, Vice-President of Industry, Business and Economics at the Research Centre, or CAR, told Vakshik.org in an e-mail: \"300,000 car workers are out of work before the end of the year not what CAR expects.\" He added that Dzik had confirmed that the figure was an estimate of \"loss of employment across the economy\" one year after the entry into force of several proposed and implemented trade policies on the automobile industry. Car workers are producing cars at the American Volkswagen Station in Chattanuja, Tin in 2017. The report of the Central African Republic did not identify as many as 367,000 job losses that would result from the automobile industry. Dzik LC said that \"the Otto sector has begun to shrink,\" but added that a quick loss of 300,000 robotics jobs\" would be orders of magnitude worse than we expect to see. Devin Nunes reported on January 10, 2021 in an interview on \"The Republicans have no means of communication\" after the Barler tech companies were cut off. \u2022 January 13, 2012, the only estimate for industry was the loss of 77,000 jobs in car sales agencies. Dzik Poletti Fuckett told California that there was a \"net and total loss\" in the assembly and spare parts sectors. \"How much loss depends on the willingness of consumers to shift brand preference from imports to cars manufactured in the United States,\" written in e-mail. He described Harris' claim as a \"fault,\" while CNN said it was a \"fault.\" The Harris campaign did not respond to our request for comment, including whether the Senator corrected her statement or intended to correct it. Our master Kamala Harris claimed that \"up to 300,000 car workers\" might lose their jobs by the end of this year. \u2219 Based on a study that, at worst, predicted that between 70,000 and 367 thousand jobs could be lost in all sectors of the American economy, but in no way in the automobile industry. The losses will occur one year after President Trump imposed a proposed 25 per cent tariff on imported vehicles and spare parts. Trump postponed his decision on those tariffs until later this year, which means that the impact of one year later will be felt only in 2020, not by the end of this year, as Harris said. The Harris claim greatly overestimates potential job losses for the automobile industry, its timing, and ignores the fact that no tariff decision has been taken. And we evaluated her claim by mistake. - The statement is not accurate.
