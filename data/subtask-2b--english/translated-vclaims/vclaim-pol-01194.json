Scott Walker supports major actions during a lame session of the Wisconsin Legislature - a full cycle of office he held when he was first elected in 2010. When he entered the last week of his tenure, the two-term Governor indicated that he generally supported bills adopted by the General Democratic Party-controlled legislature that would weaken the powers of the elected Government, Tony Evers, who defeated Walker in the November 2018 elections, and the new Attorney General Josh Cole, both democratic. There are also measures that would limit early voting, make legislators responsible for litigation aimed at repealing the Federal Affordable Care Act, and give Republicans greater control over the Economic Development Corporation in Wisconsin, the State Employment Agency. The bills submitted by the legislature and the changing attitude of Walker have made the national news trivial. It also attracted threats of legal action by liberals and criticism from prominent Republicans who described the movement as \"take over power\" and urged Walker not to sign draft laws. On 9 December 2018, four days after the adoption of the measures by the legislature during a night session, Evers appeared on \"Meet the press.\" He repeated Walker's call to veto the fucking bills, saying: \"Everything is a mess, it's a hot mess, and I think he should object to the whole deal. In fact, at least three or four of the pieces that are now there have already been intercepted. And so, it doesn't make sense to me.\" Like us on Facebook. We followed Twitter: @Politi FactWisc. So, are there three or four provisions in the Walker legislation that are now considered to have been rejected? Yes, although they are taking more ambiguous measures, they are not the ones that gave rise to the recent controversy. The Office of Legislative References in Wisconsin, a non-partisan government agency, has identified four provisions in lame legislation, similar to four measures that were repealed in September 2017 in the state budget 2017-19. This information was requested from the Bureau of the Republic by Peter Barca, Dr. Knosha. The Barca office then issued a note on similarities. The spokesman for Evers mentioned this note as evidence of her claim. We also reviewed a note on ridiculous legislation by the Wisconsin Bureau of Legislative Taxation, another non-partisan government agency. What we have found is that lame legislation already contains some provisions that are the same - or similar - provisions that were previously objected to by Walker. However, these provisions are not those contained in cheap legislation that have caused major headlines. Here's a view: Walker 2017 has the distinct right of veto to verify the facts. Greg Kelly said on January 11, 2021 in a television segment that says Joe Biden on the \"Approve\" video of the election in \"Acknowledgment.\" By Bill McCarthy: January 12, 2021 2018 GOP, the influence legislation lamely allowed the transfer of funds by the Ministry of Transport between government highway programs - without legislative oversight. The legislation would completely abolish the authority of the Ministry of Labour and Human Resources to transfer State funds between the components of the State highway programme. Less flexible in managing Evers than Walker. Vito removed the requirement that the Ministry of Administration prepare an annual report on the \"self-financing State portal\" to standardize accounting, budget and other services. The annual report is required. It is incumbent on the Evers administration that Walker's administration does not want to do. Vito removed the requirement that the Department of Veterans &apos; Affairs obtain the approval of the Joint Finance Committee of the Legislature prior to the transfer of funds to the Veterans &apos; Homes in the States to the Veterans Trust Fund. The Administration will be required to notify the Committee of any transfers. Walker objected to this measure because it could have \"introduced\" the responsibility of the executive for the management of the programmes of government agencies. This requirement places a greater burden on Evers, given that the Joint Finance Committee is the republican majority. Vito removed the requirement that the Ministry of Health Services report to the Joint Finance Committee of the Legislature on the Walker initiative to require adults who did not have children at work or to receive job training to obtain Medicaid. Vito also abolished the requirement for the approval of the Joint Finance Committee before the work/work training requirement could be implemented. Legislation would codify in the law the requirements of work and job training. Without the codification of the initiative into law, the Evers administration could have made amendments to the programme; with new legislation, the Evers administration would need the approval of the Joint Finance Committee or the full legislature. Our rule, Evers, said, \"At least three or four of the pieces in \"in the fucking Republican legislation, Walker\" is rejected before.\" There are four provisions in the silly bills that Walker has already objected to that would place new conditions or restrictions on the next Evers administration. However, these provisions are not the main provisions of the bullshit cycle that have given rise to much controversy and threats to judicial proceedings. For a precise statement, but it needs to be clarified, our classification is often correct.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01194"}
