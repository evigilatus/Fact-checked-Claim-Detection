Chris Christie.\n\nNBC Nightly News host Brian Williams asked Christie recently if it\u2019s fair for people who have no interests in the Jersey Shore to ask, \"Why the money? Why the effort, if this is the new normal?\"\n\n\"Well, listen, it's fair to ask it but I have the answer,\" Christie said during the Oct. 30 interview. \"The answer is that for New Jersey, which gives so much to this country -- by the way, 50th in return of our federal tax dollars. So New Jerseyans send more than any other state in America in federal taxes, getting back less. When that's done and you see that our state is a state that needs this to contribute to our economy and also to the soul and the vibrancy of our state, I think we have very good answers and arguments to make. And you count on one thing: you're looking at the guy who is going to make those arguments.\"\n\nWith Christie building part of his case for federal assistance around the state\u2019s return on federal tax dollars, PolitiFact New Jersey wondered whether his premise is true.\n\nAdd \"Donor State\" to the list of New Jersey\u2019s monikers.\n\nDepending on the year -- and whether adjustments are made to federal data -- New Jersey ranks at or near the bottom nationwide in this category.\n\nThe Tax Foundation, a business-backed group, tracked how much the federal government collected through taxes and returned through expenditures to states every year from 1981 to 2005.\n\nThe Washington, D.C.-based foundation calculated the federal tax burden -- a measurement meant to account for taxes that are assessed in one state, but impact taxpayers elsewhere -- to conduct its analysis.\n\nIn 17 of those 25 years, New Jersey came in last place, receiving 70 cents or less for every dollar it sent to the federal government.\n\nIn 2005 -- the most recent year analyzed by the Tax Foundation -- the federal government gave New Jersey 61 cents for every dollar it took. That was the smallest return of any state.\n\nBut that was seven years ago. Though the Tax Foundation hasn\u2019t updated its findings, other studies show New Jersey still ranks near the bottom.\n\nThe Northeast-Midwest Institute, a research organization based in Washington, D.C., that promotes 18 states in the region, released a May 2011 report on federal spending and taxation patterns that focused on New Jersey.\n\nNew Jersey ranked 48th in the nation. Only Minnesota and Delaware received smaller returns on their federal tax dollars in 2009, according to the report, which relied on raw, unadjusted data.\n\nPolitiFact New Jersey\u2019s analysis of federal data from 2010 also put New Jersey in 48th place. So even the raw data put New Jersey near the bottom in this category.\n\nBut Colleen Cain, a senior policy analyst with the Northeast-Midwest Institute who prepared the 2011 report, said in an e-mail, that \"the news behind this is not all bad.\"\n\nIn the report, Cain attributes the low ranking to New Jersey\u2019s \"relatively high income levels and greater-than-average business income tax contribution, coupled with a relatively low need for federal aid.\n\nIt does, however, underscore the importance of states like New Jersey in supporting the fiscal health of the nation generally.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nChristie said that New Jersey is \"50th in return of our federal tax dollars.\"\n\nThe Tax Foundation\u2019s analysis of 2005 data, which was adjusted to reflect each state\u2019s overall federal tax burden, ranked New Jersey 50th in the nation in this category.\n\nThe state received 61 cents for every dollar it sent to Washington, D.C. that year.\n\nThough that research is outdated, more recent analysis of raw data shows New Jersey still ranks near the bottom.\n\nOn the Truth-O-Meter, Christie\u2019s statement registers as Mostly True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Steineke\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembly Republicans \u201chave come to the table\u201d and were part of \u201cgive and take\u201d compromise on a coronavirus bill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09991"}
