How many of you don't use them? Well, I do and I've always just been thinking about germs. It is said that the police also propose (sic) to do so because of all the problems with drugs, if someone is still Fentanyl at their hands and touches the vehicle they transport to the vehicle, and then gets it on you, one drop can cause death. It's scary, but it's worth taking time to clean the handle. All you have to do is rub your nose or touch your son's mouth. Copy and send. I did! This is a scary fact.\" The article was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This allegation is inaccurate. First, the police do not warn of shopping cart handles as a means of overdose of fentanyl. Second, a closer look at medical research shows that an overdose through skin contact is highly unlikely. The idea that a small amount of fentanyl residue could cause an overdose through skin contact alone took off after the May 2017 incident, when a police officer in Ohio said that he was in contact with the remains while searching the car and then began to overdose after he had brushed some of his shirt. According to reports at that time, he took multiple doses of Narcan, an emergency \"opioid hostile,\" used to cope with the effects of an overdose, to resuscitate him. Warnings about the dangers of drug remnants became viral by November 2017 after someone posted a different version of this notice on the Facebook page of the Lichville Police Department in Arkansas. The Department recently deleted the post and, according to contemporary reports, published an update on the apology for misleading information: \"The post for Fentanyl was sent to me by another staff member in another department. I simply shared it. I'm Sek. You should've investigated more before you published it. I'm sorry for the confusion.\" First, there are different forms of fentanyl. One can legally be described as a leather patch that regulates the release of the drug through the skin. However, in this case, the viral index refers to the form of street fentanyl powder, which can be 50 to 100 times more powerful than morphine and can cause death in small doses. There is no doubt that there is a legitimate risk of an overdose of fentanyl when ingested or injected via IV, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and this overdose is increasing. However, although skin contact can be a course of exposure, experts from the CDC say that it is unlikely to lead to overdose unless there is a large amount of highly concentrated powder: \"Check out the distinctive facts mentioned by the portal on 20 January 2021 in an article \"The World Health Organization acknowledges that its tests are grossly exaggerated in the description of people testing COVID. Potential exposure methods of greatest concern include inhalation, contact with mucous membrane, ingestion, and skin exposure (e.g. needle stick). Any of these exposure pathways can lead to a variety of symptoms that can include the rapid onset of life-threatening respiratory depression. Skin contact is also a potential route of exposure, but is unlikely to lead to overdose unless large amounts of highly concentrated powder are encountered over a long period of time. Short skin contact with fentanyl or its isotopes is not expected to lead to toxic effects if any visible contamination is removed immediately.\" When it comes to whether an overdose is possible after someone touches the remains to his \"nose or mouth,\" as the article warns, Politi Vac has contacted the American Chemical Society, a non-profit organization that supports scientific research in chemistry. \"Yes, small amounts of fentanyl can be taken from surfaces and absorbed through skin or mucous membranes (e.g. Richard Sachlin, a retired chemist, wrote in an e-mail. \"Anyway, it would take a very large level of superficial contamination for someone to receive a lethal dose of fentanyl this way. The human lethal dose is not quite constant, but may be within milligrams for adults, and less for children and infants. To get a milligram of fentanyl from a shopping cart, for example, it may require tens to hundreds of milligrams on the surface, which is highly unlikely.\" The medical experts who considered the May 2017 report of the Ohio police officer who was treated after Ventanyl objected to the idea that accidental physical contact caused his reaction. They said that while the officer could have accidentally taken the powder, it was unreasonable to overdose by touching only a small quantity. Jeremy Samuel Faust, an emergency doctor at Brigam Hospital in Boston and a trainer at Harvard School of Medicine, wrote an article in Slate questioning the incident: \"La Fentanyl, not even his cousin Oper Carventanel (two of the most powerful opiates known to humanity) can cause significant clinical effects, not to mention near-death experiences, from mere skin exposure. Faust also mentions Ed Boyer in the article, a toxicology doctor, who said that Fentanyl is a dry dish on the skin \"will not be absorbed.\" At about the same time, the American College of Medical Toxicology issued a new statement of its position on fentanyl, stating that \"absolute skin absorption is unlikely to cause opioid toxicity.\" Our Facebook viral article says that the police warn shoppers not to use napkins to clean their wagon handles to mitigate the risk of overdose on the leftovers of fentanyl. Medical experts say that the risk of overdose of fentanyl residues through skin is unlikely. Rumours also spread after the police department had mistakenly shared them, which had since apologized and deleted the post. This allegation is inaccurate. We assess it wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00127"}
