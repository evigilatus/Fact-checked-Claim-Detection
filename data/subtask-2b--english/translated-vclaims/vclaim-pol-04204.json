Ken accused Benz of being afraid to face the police bias case, but Bens denied that he was afraid. Kane pressed the case with Philando Castiel's story, the Minnesota guy who was shot to death by a police officer. This heinous incident was broadcast live on Facebook by Castile's girlfriend. \"They told him Mr. Rogers with Dreddlocks at the school he was working,\" said Ken. \"The children loved him.\" But the police stopped him 40 or 50 times before that fatal incident. If you look at the verdict in this country, Afro-Americans and Latin Americans are sentenced to the same crimes at very different rates.\" We know the biggest point that Ken's been making, and we've already checked it out. But we wanted to check his number. How many times did the police stop Castiel? According to Associated Press, Cain is right. On June 9, 2016, AP reported that Castile \"was stopped at least 52 times in recent years in and around the twin cities and was given testimony for minor irregularities including speed, driving without a silencer and not wearing a seat belt.\" The report also concluded that approximately half of the charges against Castile had been dismissed. A similar investigation conducted by the National Police found 46 cases to have ceased. NPR observed \"of all stops, only six were things a police officer could notice from outside a car -- things like speed or a broken silencer.\" On January 12, 2021, he wrote in an Instagram article saying that Joe Biden remained silent about the violence in Black Lives-Mite protests. \u2022 January 16, 2012, Minnesota provides a rare overview of broader patterns of law enforcement and race. In 2001, the legislature commissioned the Institute to conduct a study on race and poverty, a centre run by a professor of law at the University of Minnesota. This study eventually covered 65 jurisdictions. The results published in 2003 showed several disturbing patterns. Law enforcement officers stopped black, Latin and American Indian drivers at higher rates than whites, and searched them at higher rates than whites, but the actual rate of finding illicit goods was lower for minorities than for whites. In a press release, Principal Director Gavin Kerney said, \"The pattern of blacks and Latins is present in almost every participating jurisdiction.\" Shortly before the shooting of Castile, he had told the officer that he had a permit to carry a weapon. Our Governor Caine said that the police stopped Castiel 40 or 50 times before he sustained fatal injuries. According to numerous independent press reports, this is accurate. The police have stopped Castiel at least 46 times. A study commissioned by the state legislature found that local police were more likely to stop and search minority drivers. We're assessing the claim right. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/fa7f5b7-a00f-4b1f-a9d7-1b27fc60eda0", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04204"}
