(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Similar versions have been shared thousands of times on both Facebook and Instagram, where some celebrities and public figures have reposted it.\nThe photo isn\u2019t a satellite image of Australia \u2014 it\u2019s a digital visualization of fire data.\nAnthony Hearsey, a Brisbane-based photographer and graphic designer, created the visualization and published it on Instagram Jan. 5. He said in the caption that he created the visualization using nearly eight months of data from NASA\u2019s Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS), which \"distributes near-real-time active fire data.\"\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These are all the areas which have been affected by bushfires,\" Hearsey said in his photo caption. \"Scale is a little exaggerated due to the render\u2019s glow.
