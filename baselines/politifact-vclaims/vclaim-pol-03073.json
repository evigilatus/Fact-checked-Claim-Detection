Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., of saying something she didn\u2019t say; we rated it Pants on Fire.\nNow, as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to fight fake news, we learned that users had flagged as questionable a post from someone Bachmann used to babysit for -- former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson. (Yes, the babysitting part is actually true.)\nThe claim about Carlson appeared first on a site called therightists.com. It was headlined, \"Gretchen Carlson: \u2018The 2nd Amendment Was Written Before Guns Were Invented.\u2019 \"\nWithin days, the item was picked up and reprinted essentially verbatim on other websites. One version got 31,400 shares through July 24.\nThe accompanying article uses as its launching-off point something that Carlson did actually do -- making an on-air break with conservative orthodoxy by saying, in the wake of the Orlando nightclub mass shooting in 2016, that the assault-weapons ban should be reinstated.\n\"Do we need AR-15s to hunt and kill deer? Do we need them to protect our families?\" she asked on air. \"Can\u2019t we hold true the sanctity of the Second Amendment while still having common sense?\"\nThese comments drew opposition from gun-rights supporters. It\u2019s at this point that the article veers off into fabrication.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe article reads, \"Interestingly, when confronted by Second Amendment supporters on Twitter, Carlson doubled down on her pro-ban stance, claiming that \u2018the fact that you\u2019re even using the Second Amendment as an argument against banning assault weapons shows me you\u2019re ignorant. Don\u2019t you know the 2nd Amendment was written before guns were even invented?\u2019 \"\nThis would be a ridiculous claim if she\u2019d actually said it.\nAs schoolchildren are taught, muskets were used in the American Revolution. (Here\u2019s an example from the collection of the Museum of the American Revolution.) And the revolution occurred more than a decade before the 1789 drafting and ratification of the Bill of Rights, which includes the Second Amendment. (\"A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\")\nIndeed, the history of firearms goes back even further than that -- to the 1300s, more than four centuries before the Second Amendment was written.\nThe first hint that this may be bogus appears elsewhere on therightists.com website. On the site\u2019s \"About Us\" page, a grammatically challenged warning explains that therightists.com \"is independent News platform That allow People and independent Journalist to bring the news directly to the readers. Readers come to us as a source of independent news that not effected from the big channels. This is HYBRID site of news and satire. part of our stories already happens, part, not yet. NOT all of our stories are true!\"\nOf course, this warning isn\u2019t noted on the actual page the Carlson story appears on.\nWe also couldn\u2019t find any credible news source reporting Carlson\u2019s words as cited in therightists.com article.\nFinally, we checked with Carlson\u2019s office. In a statement, her office confirmed that the article was \"total B.S.\"\nBottom line: Carlson did not say, \"The 2nd Amendment Was Written Before Guns Were Invented.\" The accusation that she did rates as Pants on Fire.\n Share the Facts 2017-07-24 19:53:16 UTC   PolitiFact    1 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Pants on Fire  Say Gretchen Carlson said, \"The 2nd Amendment Was Written Before Guns Were Invented.\"    Bloggers on the Internet   various websites Thursday, June 15, 2017 2017-06-15    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03073"}
