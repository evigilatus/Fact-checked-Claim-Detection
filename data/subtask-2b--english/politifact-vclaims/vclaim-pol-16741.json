When we reached out to Shields, he said he \"misspoke,\" and he later clarified his point on Twitter.\u00a0\n\"I meant to say more subpoenas than laws that have been passed, not bills,\" he told us.\u00a0\nMea Culpa - I misspoke on @TheLeadCNN yesterday when I said House Democrats have issued more subpoenas than they have passed bills. It's more subpoenas than they have had laws *passed/signed*. Still a valid point about their wasted majority but want to be accurate https://t.co/I1k5aMe3no\u2014 Mike Shields (@mshields007) November 1, 2019 \nEven this revised claim gives a misleading impression, however. Experts said it\u2019s meaningless to compare subpoenas with House bills enacted into law, because while a committee chairman can unilaterally issue a subpoena, there are more hurdles when it comes to legislation.\nCounting House-backed laws can be misleading\nThe Washington Times counted 56 publicly acknowledged subpoenas that House Democrats issued between the start of their majority and the article\u2019s Oct. 22 publication, including 15 related to the impeachment inquiry.\nThe report\u2019s authors did not respond to requests for comment, but their subpoena tally lines up with what other news outlets have reported. By our count, the House has subpoenaed at least 24 people to date as part of the impeachment inquiry.\u00a0\nPelosi spokesperson Ashley Etienne said she believes the House has issued approximately 47 in total, adding that many were due to \"stonewalling of the current administration and Trump\u2019s posture of refusing to respond to congressional requests, inquiries and subpoenas.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJake Tapper\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in remarks in a CNN broadcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second presidential impeachment of Donald Trump was \u201cthe most bipartisan impeachment in American history.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEtienne also pointed out that during President Bill Clinton\u2019s administration, Republicans in the majority issued more than 1,000 subpoenas.\nThe Washington Times said the House has introduced and passed 46 bills-turned-laws since Democrats took over in January. According to Congress.gov, that\u2019s accurate: There are 43 bills and 3 joint resolutions that originated in the House, passed the Senate and were signed into law by Trump.\nBut Josh Tauberer, president of GovTrack.us, a nonpartisan website that tracks government and congressional data, said the number of House bills that become law is not a reliable indicator of how hard the House is working to legislate.\nThat\u2019s because bills are often introduced in pairs, with the House and Senate each proposing their own versions. \"But which one is enacted is up to chance and doesn't indicate that only legislators in one chamber put in any effort,\" Tauberer said.\nNot only that, but the text of a bill is often replaced as it goes through the legislative process, meaning \"the chamber that a bill originated in, and a bill's original sponsor, may have no connection to the substance of the bill when it is enacted,\" he said.\nThis year, the House and Senate have combined to pass 66 bills that earned Trump\u2019s signature, according to Congress.gov. But Tauberer said Pelosi\u2019s House has voted on about 1,200 pages of new law and roughly 200 unique legislative proposals that ended up in those enacted laws.\u00a0\nThe House can\u2019t make laws by itself\nExperts said the biggest problem with the subpoenas-to-bills comparison is the lack of attention it pays to the Senate\u2019s role in sending House-backed bills to the president\u2019s desk.\n\"The House can't pass \u2018bills into law\u2019 by itself,\" said Joshua Huder, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University.\nAccording to Congress.gov, the House has passed or agreed to 522 bills and resolutions since January. But the Senate hasn\u2019t acted on many of them. In July, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., vowed to block Democrats\u2019 progressive policy proposals, telling an audience to \"think of me as the grim reaper.\"\nThe GOP doesn\u2019t have the same blocking power when it comes to subpoenas, however.\u00a0\n\"We are talking about two completely different processes,\" said Donald Wolfensberger, director of the Congress Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center, a Washington think tank. \"A committee chairman can unilaterally issue a subpoena, whereas it takes a majority of House members and senators to enact a law. The latter is a much bigger hump to surmount.\"\nOf course, Shields\u2019 botched version of the comparison is even more wrong, since he originally said there have been more subpoenas than bills passed, which simply isn\u2019t true.\nOur ruling\nShields said Democrats \"have issued more subpoenas than they\u2019ve passed bills.\"\nThat\u2019s wrong, and Shields clarified his point on Twitter. But the claim that House Democrats are responsible for more subpoenas than bills passed into law is also misleading, since it compares two very different processes.\nWe rate this statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16741"}
