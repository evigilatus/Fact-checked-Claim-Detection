The release of the proposed rule \"would correct the gap that has widened the reach of SNAP recipients in some states to include people who receive assistance when they do not clearly need it.\" What exactly does that mean? Thus, Glenn Grothman, President of the United States Republic, R. Glenboola, framed the plan when he supported the plan in an article on 2 October 2019 in the newspaper Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: \"Many people didn't know that the millionaire was eligible for food stamps,\" he said. \"I'm glad Donald Trump came and decided to put an end to it.\" The article indicated that some 40,000 people in Wisconsin would lose food benefits under the proposed changes. The State will also have to improve its computer systems, retrain workers and make other changes that will cost millions of dollars annually. But let's go back to Grootman and his claim. Is he right that a millionaire is eligible for food stamps? Let's take a look. How the program operates according to the article of the Sentinel newspaper: About 40 million people, including some 644,000 Wisconsin residents, received food stamps in 2018. Like most states, Wisconsin provides food benefits to persons eligible for other government programmes without further testing of income and assets. The proposed rule would prevent people in other programmes from automatically qualifying for food stamps. Reviews of their income and assets are required to ensure that, in most cases, their income is at the federal poverty level or less than 130 per cent and that they do not have liquid assets in excess of $2,250. The poverty rate in the three-member family is 130 per cent of the federal poverty level at approximately $2,250 per month. At the national level, the proposal is expected to save $2.5 billion and reduce benefits to about 3 million people. As stated in the article of the Sentinel: In Wisconsin, some 39,600 people in about 24,100 households will lose more than $11 million a year, according to estimates by the State Ministry of Health Services. Of these, some 13,000 are children and about 11,000 are elderly. So, where does the millionaire come from? The back door, apparently. When Grootman staff were asked to provide support, they referred to several news articles, including a report issued on 16 September 2019 by a Washington examiner who reminded readers of the case of Leroy Vic, who continued to receive food stamps after winning $2 million in Michigan State lottery in 2010. On January 26, 2021, Jim Steinke stated on Republican Twitter that they \"come to the table\" and were part of a compromise \"Give and Take\" on the Corona virus bill. By Eric Letk \u2022 27 January 2021 \"Vick used his profits to buy a new house and convertible Odie, all while continuing to get SNAP benefits,\" said the examiner's article. That story makes rounds for a while. In 2011, the ABC News published a report on the Vic case with a headline: \"How can a man who made millions in the lottery use food stamps?\" At that time, Michigan used federal guidelines based solely on income eligibility for food stamps. The State considered that the total lottery payment of $850,000 was an asset rather than income. So, under state policy then, Vic can legally get food stamps. Subsequently, the State prohibited any person with assets in excess of $5,000, with the exception of a car, from the food stamps programme. That ban got Vic out of the philatelic rolls. According to the report of the Congressional Research Service on the SNAP programme, as of October 2018, 34 states - Wisconsin among them - do not realize the assets of persons applying for food stamps. When the proposed changes to the rules were announced, there was no mention of the lottery winners, but the United States Secretary of Agriculture, Sonny Birdo, referred to the case of a man from Minnesota Harbor, retired engineer Rob Andersander, who registered for food stamps to prove a point. On September 28, 2016, an op-ed article for the Saint. The Men's Cloud, part of the United States network today, said that he and his wife had a net value of over $1 million. In those and other accounts, he wanted to reveal a gap that would allow rich people, or at least those who were not in need, to qualify for food stamps. So he filled out the food stamps in June 2016. He said he was in the lead on his property. Andersander said that he gave the money he received for charity when he described his case on June 20, 2019 at the Sub-Committee on Home Farming, the story triggered a party firestorm. Democratic legislators accused Andesander of \"concealing the government with a ridiculous millionaire trick.\" The Republicans welcomed Andersander for exposing the flaws of the failed system. Photo by Wisconsin in a letter from 23 September 2019 to Birdo, the United States cents Tammy Baldwin from Wisconsin and 14 other democratic senators urged the Trump administration to withdraw the proposal. The letter cited the negative consequences of this rule and argued that the Department had not carried out a thorough analysis of its impact on children and families. Other democratic officials, including the Government. Tony Evers and Attorney General Josh Cole are against change too. \"The bottom line is that you have a greater cost of bureaucracy and administration and fewer benefits going to the people of Wisconsin,\" said Cole in the newspaper Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Certainly, the reduction of the clot would not apply only to the millionaire. This also applies to people who make only $1 a year more than current guidelines -- people who are far from rich. Gruthman's behind the show. \"It's obviously frustrating for people living on their salary to know that the person who preceded them in class using FoodShare may have $200,000 in the bank,\" said Grothman to Paulette Fuckett Wisconsin. Gruthman claimed that millions were eligible for food stamps, but \"Donald Trump came and decided to put an end to it.\" The millionaire may have exceeded, but Grootman claimed that he was qualified - not that he was receiving benefits in large numbers. The rule proposed by the Ministry of Agriculture in Tramp would prevent people in other programmes from automatically qualifying for food stamps. This will also require a review of the applicant &apos; s assets - not just his income. In the past, it was this provision that allowed rich individuals to receive benefits. Wisconsin is among the dozens of states that do not now check assets. We appreciate Grootman &apos; s claim to be true.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00072"}
