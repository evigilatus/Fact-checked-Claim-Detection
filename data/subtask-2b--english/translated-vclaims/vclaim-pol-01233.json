An article from a conservative blog, David Harris Grew.com, is one of the sites that says that the picture was a \"theatrical trick.\" The story was highlighted as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Here's how we know the picture is real. What happened at the border with Miza and thousands of other immigrants travelled from Honduras to Mexico to seek asylum in the United States as part of a convoy formed in mid-October. After their doors were closed at a port of entry at the border, hundreds of the group began a peaceful demonstration on 25 November, which turned into a chaotic demonstration. Customs and border protection officials said that some demonstrators had fled the group and tried to cross a hole and started throwing stones and bottles at border agents. In response, the agents fired tear gas at the public. Today, several immigrants fired missiles at San Diego agents. Border patrol personnel deployed tear gas to waste the group because of the threat to customer safety. Many agents were hit by missiles. The situation is evolving and a statement to that effect is being issued shortly.

The mother of five Pacific News children told her that she had not tried to cross the border but that she was standing near the fence with her children when agents fired several canisters at them. \"I felt sad, I was scared. I wanted to cry. Then I grabbed my daughters and ran, and I told Miza Bazvid. \"I thought my children would die with me because of the gas we inhaled.\" So we know that the picture wasn't organized, and that Miza is a real person. The bloggers who promoted the conspiracy theory that it was forged by Democrats raised this branded version to conduct their case. \"After further analysis, that \"wretched\" picture of a woman with barefoot children in diapers running from the American border wall was \"Falsy News,\" announcing the article. The article referred to other photographers who could be seen in the background: \"You can see a group of men pretending to be photographers while another young man runs towards a second photographer. In other places of the picture, people stand quietly without feeling the urge at all. The woman with the kids was just a picture. First, it is clearly common for multiple journalists to cover the same urgent press event. To some extent, tear gas happened. But not only take photographic evidence and press statements; the Border Patrol has acknowledged its own response. Customs and border protection have been tweeted that clients have spread tear gas against immigrants. In a subsequent statement, the Agency stated that it was \"using less lethal devices\" in response to the crowd trying to cross the border and throw missiles. The ruling bloggers published an article claiming that a picture of an immigrant mother and her children fleeing tear gas on the United States-Mexico border was a trick. It's not.
