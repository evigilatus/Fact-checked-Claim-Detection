They did", "text": "On a Sunday morning news show, U.S. Attorney General William Barr said federal officers used no chemical irritants to disperse a crowd of people near a D.C church President Donald Trump was due to visit.\nAppearing on CBS News\u2019 Face the Nation, Barr said Park Police and Secret Service used \"standard crowd control\" methods during the June 1 action. Host Margaret Brennan reminded him that the Park Police had said chemical irritants were used.\n\"No, there were not chemical irritants,\" Barr said June 7. \"Pepper spray is not a chemical irritant. It's not chemical.\"\nBrennan interjected: \"Pepper spray, you\u2019re saying, is what was used.\"\n\"Pepper balls. Pepper balls,\" Barr clarified.\n\nBarr\u2019s statement about chemical irritants is wrong. The Park Police issued a statement saying its units fired pepper balls, a product that contains a chemical irritant. Pepper balls are a generic term for small plastic balls that burst on impact. They fall into the category of less-lethal impact munitions. Think of the popular mock battle game called paintball using balls filled with something other than paint.\u00a0\nThe Park Police told PolitiFact that its officers deployed products from the PepperBall company.\nThe weakest variety of pepper ball on the PepperBall company\u2019s website contains a 0.5% concentration of the chemical irritant pelargonic acid vanillylamide, or PAVA, a synthetic compound. (The company offers a version that is 10 times more potent, but it is unclear if Park Police used that one.)\n\"PAVA primarily affects the eyes causing closure and severe pain,\" according to a report by Britain's Committee on Toxicity, an independent scientific body that advises the government.\nThe National Institutes of Health web page on the active ingredient in PAVA powder nonivamide carries these four warning pictograms:\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

While there was debate over the description of the chemicals used, the Park Police confirmed that chemical agents had been deployed.\nRELATED: White House says officers didn\u2019t fire tear gas, rubber bullets on protesters. Why that\u2019s misleading\nPAVA is the synthetic version of the natural chemical found in chili peppers. For those interested in chemistry, it is formed by \"the formal condensation of the amino group of 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzylamine with the carboxy group of nonanoic acid,\" according to the NIH website.\nA Justice Department report on less-lethal weapons said pepper balls contain \"highly irritating pepper powder.\"\nThe PepperBall company\u2019s website says its product is good for \"area saturation,\" meaning anyone close to the point of impact is affected by the chemical.\u00a0\nAs the area outside the church was cleared, multiple eyewitnesses and news accounts reported noxious fumes that caused a burning sensation in protesters\u2019 eyes and throats. As federal officers fired on the crowd near the church, protesters cried out that tear gas was being used.\nTear gas just deployed at 16th & H Streets, police in riot gear & on horseback pushed the crowd back to Connecticut Av #dcprotest pic.twitter.com/LOd2UC5nmH\u2014 Ken Duffy (@KenDuffyNews) June 1, 2020 \nWe reached out to the Justice Department and did not hear back.\nOur ruling\nBarr said federal officers used no chemical irritants to clear people away from a D.C. church Trump planned to visit.
