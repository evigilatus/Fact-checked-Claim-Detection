Owens said that black conservatives face criticism from the left because they \"have the guts to think for ourselves and learn about our history, and the myth of things, such as the Southern Transformation and the Southern Strategy, that never happened.\" The \"South Strategy\" refers to the efforts of the Republican Party to appeal to the southern white voters who were stopped by the Democratic Party, which defends civil rights. Historians objected to her statement, including Cornell Lawrence Glickman and Arkansas Angie Maxwell University. The historian Princeton Kevin Cross called Owens' statements \"blah, blah, blah.\" Owens is the spokesman for the non-profit governor in the United States of America and encourages blacks to leave the Democratic Party (called \"Bleixit.\" Owens did not respond to our electronic request for comment. On Twitter, she said that she was referring to \"the myth\" that Republicans and Democrats in Congress changed parties. Cross challenged her interpretation: \"Owens is expected to refer to the few members of Congress who have replaced the parties as \"confirming\" that the greater literature on ethnic reorganization is a myth - although this is not in fact something that historians and political scientists have emphasized in working on this.\" The strategy of the South Republicans has been documented for decades - including by the Republicans who were part of it. The facts about the southern strategy of this fact-checking, we met with historians and reviewed news articles from the age of civil rights. Joseph Zarap, a columnist in influential newspapers, was called \"mainly the strategy of segregation\" in the 1962 column. When the Republican Barry Goldwater ran for president in 1964, his southern alternatives manipulated the fact that he voted against the Civil Rights Act. He was born in the deep south, where he won a bunch of states, but eventually lost to Lyndon B. Johnson. By 1968, the Republicans had been controlling their approach and collecting it in a way that would enable them to win, as Maxwell said, a professor of Arkansas and an expert in Southern politics. Republican candidate Richard Nixon reached out to the white South to oppose the school bus and promised that his administration would not \"destroy anything in your throats.\" The strongest evidence of the Southern Strategy comes directly from the Republicans at the time. This includes Clarence Towns, who served as Director of the Minority Division of the National Commission of the Republic in the 1960s. Professor Harvard Leah Wright Regor wrote about Towns in her book Black Republican Unity. He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. By Bill McCarthy, January 12, 2021, when Nixon broke the oath, Towns told journalists in 1970, \"There is total fear of the so-called Southern Strategy. Blacks understand that their well-being is sacrificed for political gain. There must have been some moral leadership from the president on the race issue, and none.\" In 1969, Nixon wrote the White House of Lamar Alexander, now Tennessee in the United States Senate, about the Southern Strategy in a memorandum following the failure of Clement Heinsworth &apos; s candidacy, which was opposed by civil rights groups. \"The unconventional strategy - We have called for the kind of political battle that eventually broke out when we named a Republican governor who turned to democracy from South Carolina. This southern strategy was confirmed at a time when discussion was taking place at the national level, Alexander wrote. The strategic expert Nixon Kevin Phillips publicly discussed the Southern Strategy in a newspaper article in 1973: \"If the liberal crowd in New Washington can tear itself apart from Watergate's orgasm and polish Daniel Ellsberg to look a little under the Mason Dixon line, they may attract a useful political vision, namely, that the South Washington strategy seems to be going along - and roll over local victories - as if J. Gordon Liddy never existed.\" Ellsberg issued Pentagon papers in 1971 while I had a federal agent convicted of illegal wiretapping. Philips told The New York Times in 1970 that the Republicans would receive no more than 10 to 20 per cent of the \"negro voting\" and need no more. He wrote: \"The more niggers they register as Democrats in the south, the faster the whites than the niggers leave the Democrats to be Republicans.\" \"There's where the voices are. Without that encouragement from blacks, whites will retreat to their comfortable old arrangement with local Democrats.\" In the end, winning white voters from the south required the use of an encrypted language, as explained by the campaign adviser Lee Atwater, who worked in the Reagan campaign in 1980, in an interview in 1981. In sound, it can be heard to describe how in 1954, ethnic seduction can be used to describe black Americans, but this \"retreat\" by 1968 - requires a hub for more abstract language. \"So you say things like forcing traffic, state rights, and all that stuff, and you become very abstract. Now, you're talking about tax cuts, and all these things you're talking about are totally economic things and then blacks get hurt worse than whites.\" Reagan used language such as \"State rights\" and \"care queens,\" which critics said was an encrypted racial language. \"The party shift in the south from 1960s to George W. Bush is the greatest party shift in all American history,\" said Maxwell. In 2005, the President of the National Commission of the Republic, Ken Melman, told the National Congress of the Assembly in Milwaukee that the use of race as an evincing issue was a \"fault.\" \"In the 1970s to the 1980s and 1990s, the Democratic Party consolidated its gains in African American society, and we Republicans did not communicate effectively. Some Republicans have abandoned winning the African-American vote, looking at the other direction or trying to benefit politically from ethnic polarization. I'm here today as president of the Republic to tell you that we were wrong. The governor Owens said Southern Strategy sheep never happened. The efforts of the Republican Party from the 1960s to win over white voters from the South have been documented by scientists for decades. The strongest evidence of this comes from the Republicans who were part of that strategy. There are many examples where the approach to documentation or interviews is mentioned. We're assessing this statement wrong. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4ae2eb19-9d52-4731-9446-930b8264775", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00774"}
