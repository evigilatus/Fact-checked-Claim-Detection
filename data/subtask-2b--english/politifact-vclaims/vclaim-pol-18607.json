Conjecture and misinformation about the president\u2019s condition took off on Instagram, Twitter, TikTok and Facebook.\nSeveral posts were flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\n\n(Screenshot from Facebook)\nThere is a lot of confusion surrounding Trump\u2019s use of supplemental oxygen to treat his COVID-19 symptoms. But is there any evidence that the president boarded Marine One with a \"portable oxygen concentrator?\"\u00a0\nNo \u2014\u00a0multiple fact-checkers have debunked the conspiracy theory, and video evidence refutes it. We reached out to the original poster for a comment, but we haven\u2019t heard back.\nThe confusion stems from the Trump administration\u2019s shifting timeline for when the president first tested positive for the coronavirus and whether he was administered supplemental oxygen.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMasks have negative impacts on 68% of children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jon Greenberg \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Sean Conley, the White House physician, originally declined to say whether he had given Trump oxygen. But on Oct. 3, Conley told reporters that Trump was \"fever-free and off supplemental oxygen.\" Several news outlets have since reported that Trump was given oxygen on the morning of Oct. 2 \u2014\u00a0before he left for Walter Reed.\u00a0\n\"Yesterday morning we were real concerned with that,\" said White House chief of staff Mark Meadows in an interview with Fox News on Oct. 3. \"He had a fever and his blood oxygen level had dropped rapidly.\"\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean Trump had a portable oxygen concentrator when he boarded Marine One.\nThe source of the viral claim appears to be a now-suspended Twitter account that published the photos of Trump walking to Marine One on Oct. 2. The post was shared thousands of times before Twitter suspended the account for violating its rules.\nOther angles of Trump\u2019s walk from the White House to Marine One don\u2019t support the conspiracy theory. Take a closer look at the footage:\n\nThere does not appear to be anything in the right pocket of Trump\u2019s blazer. And there are no tubes running up the president\u2019s back to his nose. If he did use a portable oxygen concentrator, you\u2019d be able to see tubes behind Trump\u2019s ears or across his face.\nWe reached out to the White House and the Trump campaign for more information, but we haven\u2019t heard back.\nThe Facebook post is inaccurate. We rate it False.\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections FactChat #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click\u00a0here, for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18607"}
