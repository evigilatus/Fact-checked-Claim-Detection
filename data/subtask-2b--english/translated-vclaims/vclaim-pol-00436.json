In an op-ed article of the Washington Post on black-white differences, the two democratic presidential candidates were brought together. He said: \"The wealth gap between black and white can be closed by targeting extreme wealth at the top.\" \"The straight path to racial equality is through one percent,\" Sanders wrote July 10. \"A system in which we do not address both racial and economic inequality is one in which some people, particularly African Americans, will be left behind.\" Saunders sharpened the point with Walmart's example. \"Mart is the largest private employer of African-Americans in the country,\" wrote Sanders. 42% of his assistants are black. It pays its employees less than the living wage - even while the Walton family has more than 40% of the Americans at the bottom.\" Walmart is the largest private employer in the country, giving her an advantage in recruiting the largest number of African Americans. Sanders cited Paulette Fuckett to support his assertion about Walton's wealth. But Sanders is exaggerating part of Walmart's partners who are African-Americans. 42% means that almost half of all sales partners and martes are black. That's not the case. According to Walmart's report, 42 per cent of the company's partners are coloured. Sarah Ford, the spokesman for Sanders, admitted that this included many non-American workers of African descent. On January 16, 2021, Jordan Rachel stated in Tweedda that the minimum wage of $15 per hour would raise the price of taco bill burrito to $38. By Bill McCarthy: 20 January 2021, she said that the campaign \"regressed\" for the mistake and would \"true the way forward.\" This chart is from page 8 of the Wal-Mart report. The Large Orange Circle 21% with part of all black or African-American workers includes a range of job categories, such as assistants, managers, executives, technicians and more. For partners only, a deeper graph in the report (p. 38) shows that 22.5 per cent of sales workers are African Americans. Walmart's last report has almost the same number, 22.2%. Blacks account for about 13 per cent of the United States labour force. Our rule, Sanders, said that 42% of Wal-Mart's partners are African-Americans. This figure applies to all colored people, not just African Americans. The actual number is 22.2%. This is almost twice the proportion of blacks in the labour force, but almost half of it is said by Sanders. We value this allegation wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00436"}
