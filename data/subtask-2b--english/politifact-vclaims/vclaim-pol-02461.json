For brothers and sisters of U.S. citizens, the waiting period for a visa is over 13 years.\nType of relatives that can be sponsored by U.S. citizens and green card holders\nU.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents (green card holders) can bring certain family members to the United States to live here permanently.\nBut there are restrictions. No one can directly petition for an aunt, uncle, cousin, niece, nephew, in-law relative or grandparent, according to USCIS.\nGreen card holders can petition for a spouse and unmarried children, including unmarried sons and daughters 21 and over.\nSponsorship categories expand for U.S. citizens, who can also petition for married children. Sons and daughters of U.S. citizens can include their own children in the petition. If a U.S. citizen is over 21 years old, he or she also can sponsor parents, brothers and sisters to come here on a green card.\nAdditionally, U.S. citizens can also sponsor a fiance or fiancee to come on a nonimmigrant visa, and eventually file for a green card after marriage.\nUnmarried, under 21-year-old children of a fiance, fiancee or spouse of a U.S. citizen can also be admitted on nonimmigrant visas and later adjust their status.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs there a way that an immigrant \u2018can bring in\u2019 an aunt or uncle, indirectly?\nIf an immigrant becomes a U.S. citizen, he or she can sponsor a parent. If that parent eventually becomes a U.S. citizen, he or she could sponsor a brother or sister (the aunt or uncle of the original immigrant), noted Steven Camarota, director of research for Center for Immigration Studies, which favors low immigration levels.\n\"You could see that as indirect sponsorship of aunts and uncles,\" Camarota said.\nIndirect sponsorship is theoretically possible, but would take a long time, said Stephen H. Legomsky, an emeritus professor at the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis who served as chief counsel of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services from 2011 to 2013.\nAn immigrant would first have to become a naturalized citizen \u2014 an option available after being a permanent resident for at least five\u00a0years. As a naturalized citizen, an immigrant can petition for siblings, and the siblings could bring in their spouses and unmarried children.\nBut there are limits on the number of visas issued per year per family category.\nMore than 3.9 million people were in line for a visa as of Nov. 1, 2017, according to the U.S. State Department. Brothers and sisters of adult U.S. citizens fall under a \"fourth-preference\" category, which had 2.3 million people waiting for a visa \u2014 the wait period is over 13 years for immigrants from most nations, but even longer for some countries with heavy demand, such as Mexico and the Philippines.\nSiblings in the Philippines would have to wait at least 23 years for a visa, and Mexican siblings at least 20 years.\n\"As a practical matter, because of these long backlogs there is not as much chain migration as President Trump claims,\" said Stephen W. Yale-Loehr, a professor of immigration law practice\u00a0at Cornell Law School.\nOur ruling\nTrump said \"a single immigrant can bring in unlimited numbers of distant relatives.\"\nTrump\u2019s team did not go on the record to identify who Trump considered to be \"distant relatives,\" but it appears he\u2019s referring to anyone who is not a spouse or minor child.\nGreen card holders can sponsor a spouse and unmarried children, including unmarried sons and daughters over 21 years old. For U.S. citizens, the categories expand to include parents, married children, brothers and sisters.\nNo one can directly petition an aunt, uncle, cousin, niece, nephew, in-law relative or grandparent. But theoretically, one immigrant\u2019s arrival in the United States could lead to the immigration of an aunt or uncle \u2014 if the first immigrant becomes a U.S. citizen and petitioned a parent, that parent could eventually become a U.S. citizen and petition his or her siblings.\nStill, there are numerical limits on visas issued per year per family category. For some relatives, the wait period for a visa is over 13 years.\nTrump\u2019s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.
