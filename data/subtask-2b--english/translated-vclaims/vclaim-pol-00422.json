On June 29, a video quickly posted on Twitter showed a teenager in Texas and the martin opened the cover of the Blue Bill ice cream box, and then proceed to lick the upper layer of ice cream before putting it back on the shelf. The unsanitary - illegal section of events has spread widely, leading to the arrest of the girl, as well as at least one copycat. The copycat, a 36-year-old man from Louisiana, was also identified and now he's facing charges. Now, Facebook claims that in the wake of this ice cream crime, the Food and Drug Department has changed its packaging rules, and now it will require a stamp on all cartoons, resulting in a higher product cost to consumers. The article says: \"What she did when she licked BlueBell ice cream. The Food and Drug Administration will now need sealed ice cream cans. Yeah, there's gonna be a tight plastic seal on the ice cream cans now. This would increase the cost of ice cream because the machines would need to buy factories to close the carton, let alone buy additional shut-down materials and electricity to operate the machinery. The plastic sealing material will now find its way to already loaded landfills, increasing the taxation of the garbage system. So remember when you see the seal on ice cream and the higher price it was her fault and her fault alone. That's what idiots do to the rest of us who aren't stupid. Have a good day!\" The article was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Although this ice cream lick may be aggregate, FDA has not yet required that all ice cream companies have closed the ice cream cans. Peter Cassell, lead journalist for food emergencies and safety at FDA, told Polyte Fact that the allegation was inaccurate. Castle wrote in an e-mail: \"The issue that triggered these rumours is a matter for local law enforcement agencies and the company that makes ice cream.\" Some ice cream companies, for example Hagen Daz, already have sealed containers. In contrast to Facebook &apos; s view that plastic seals are a burden, Blue Bell received a lot of noise on social media in the aftermath of the incident, as users questioned why there were no protective seals in ice cream containers. At first, the company said that the production of half its gallons had to be turned upside down where ice cream froze into cover, \"Creaming a natural seal... any attempt to open the product must be noticeable,\" according to NBC Today.com. However, following the appearance of the second spoon of Blue Bill ice cream, the company issued a statement stating that food safety was its highest priority and that they were taking issues of manipulation \"in great seriousness.\" \"We're always looking for ways to improve,\" said the statement, \"including considering ways within our manufacturing process to add extra protection to the cartoon.\" We ruled after a viral video showing a teenager licking the Blue Bill ice cream basin before returning it to the Texas shelf and the Walmart, an article on Facebook claiming that the incident had led FDA to now ask all ice cream companies to add protective seals to their products, which led to an increase in the cost of ice cream. But the FDA said the rumors were inaccurate and the incident was being handled by local police and the damaged ice cream company. In contrast to some other ice cream companies, Blue Bell does not currently have sealed containers, but in a statement he says he's looking at ways to \"add protective additions to the cartoon.\" We value this allegation wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00422"}
