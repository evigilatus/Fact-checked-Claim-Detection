The site included a photograph of the Clintons at an airport, but that image was from the 2013 renaming of the airport in Little Rock, Ark., after the political power couple.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe story notes that Ukraine has no extradition treaties with the United States, which is true. And Hillary Clinton has been to Lviv, but that was as first lady 20 years ago.\nIn reality, Hillary Clinton was in Washington on Oct. 28, not Ukraine, for a speech at the Human Rights Campaign\u2019s national dinner. She was then in the Chicago suburbs on Oct. 30 to sign copies of her new book, What Happened.\nFreedomJunkshun.com is a member of a series of fake websites associated with Christopher Blair, who lives in Maine. Blair is a self-described liberal troll who creates fictional stories to try to fool conservative readers.\nThe website uses a similar layout and style as other Blair-affiliated sites, and carries a disclaimer that reads, \"All people, places, names and images should be considered fictitious or fictitious representations.\"\nThe real indictments were for President Donald Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his associate Rick Gates, who pleaded not guilty to 12 counts of making false statements, money laundering and more.\nGeorge Papadopoulos, a former Trump foreign policy adviser, also was indicted for lying to the FBI and pleaded guilty.\nThis is another in a spate of fake news stories that claimed Democrats were among the people charged in the Mueller investigation.
