Governor Dan Forest thinks he would be a better governor than Roy Cooper.\nBut Cooper says Forest hasn\u2019t put in the work needed to hold the office. The two went at it on Oct. 14 in North Carolina\u2019s lone gubernatorial debate.\n\"The Lieutenant Governor is on the state board of education where the state opening plans are discussed and voted on. And while I\u2019m working with them and public health officials, he\u2019s missed almost half of the board of education meetings during the pandemic,\" Cooper said.\nForest responded by saying \"I\u2019ve been to almost every one of those meetings, especially every voting meeting. My staff sits in. My education experts and advisors sit in on all of those meetings, we don\u2019t miss a beat on an education meeting. We never have. We\u2019ve always been present at all of them.\"\nSo what\u2019s the truth here?\u00a0\nWe\u2019ll rate Cooper\u2019s statement, since he\u2019s the one bringing up the subject as an attack.\nHe said Forest has missed almost half of North Carolina\u2019s education board meetings during the pandemic.\nAs it turns out, Cooper\u2019s claim is almost spot-on.\nAttendance record\nThe Board of Education has not uploaded its meeting minutes since March. So we listened to audio files uploaded to YouTube. Then we asked the North Carolina Department of Instruction for attendance records.\nCooper declared a state of emergency because of the coronavirus on March 10, so we\u2019re using that as the start date for the pandemic in North Carolina.\nThere have been 28 meetings since then, according to Deanna Townsend-Smith, DPI\u2019s director of board operations and policy. Most of them were over an hour long, meaning the board has spent well over 24 hours talking about education policy just in the last eight months.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForest has missed 13 of the 28 meetings, or 46%.\nForest missed meetings on March 18 and 27. He attended five meetings in a row before missing seven out of 10 from the beginning of May to the end of July. He then missed four in a row between Sept. 3 and Oct. 7.\nIn some cases, Forest arrived late to meetings but was still counted present.\u00a0\n\"Present does not always mean attendance for the entire meeting, but present at some point and time,\" Townsend-Smith said.\nWhat Forest missed\nIt\u2019s unclear why Forest missed the meetings. Neither his office nor his campaign responded to questions from PolitiFact this week.\nForest said during the debate that his experts and advisors \"sit in on all\" of the meetings.\nStaff members can\u2019t vote. And Townsend-Smith told PolitiFact that board members \"cannot have anyone attend the meeting on their behalf.\"\nForest \"may have had someone listening to the meeting on his behalf,\" she said, adding \"however that is not something that is within my purview and you would need to verify that with the LG\u2019s office.\"\nForest has downplayed the threat of the coronavirus, saying the state should reopen schools without a mask mandate. DPI\u2019s records show Forest missed votes that made changes to grading, testing and graduation requirements, set guidelines for remote learning, as well as another vote on grade point averages.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nCooper said Forest has \"missed almost half of the board of education meetings during the pandemic.\"\nWe\u2019re not here to say whether or not Forest should have attended the meetings. However, we can say whether Cooper\u2019s stat is correct.\nThe state Department of Instruction says Forest has missed 13 of 28 meetings since the pandemic started. That means he\u2019s missed 46% of the meetings.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s close enough to \"half\" for us. We rate Cooper\u2019s claim is True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18830"}
