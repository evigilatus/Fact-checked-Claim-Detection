(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe claim in the headline isn\u2019t supported in the story \u2014 nowhere in it does it say that drinking wine is more important than exercising in order to live a long life. It even includes lines about the importance of working out.\n\"We strongly advise you to have a glass or two of your favorite wine during the day, but make sure you also go for a run or walk first,\" the post said.\nThe higherperspectives.com story references a study on aging and dementia, centered on people 90 years and older. The study began in 2003 and is known as The 90+ Study, led by researchers at the University of California-Irvine.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Gateway Pundit\n\n\nstated on January 20, 2021 in an article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWHO admits their testing grossly overstates individuals testing positive for COVID.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Noah Y. Kim \u2022 January 22, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of the findings of The 90+ Study found that people who drank moderate amounts of alcohol or coffee lived longer than those who abstained from it, and that people who were overweight in their 70s lived longer than did normal or underweight people.\nOne of the The 90+ Study investigators, Dr. Claudia Kawas, told PolitiFact that they published a paper on alcohol and longevity in 2007 and have not done work in the area since then. It should not be inferred from their studies that alcohol is more important than exercise, she said.\nKawas at a February 2018 American Association for the Advancement of Science conference also said there was a connection between exercise and longevity.\n\"Exercise, as little as 15 minutes a day was associated with greater longevity,\" Kawas said. \"Thirty minutes was better, 45 minutes was even better than that. And mercifully for couch potatoes like me, three hours (or more) was no better than 45 minutes.\"\nKawas\u2019 findings don\u2019t say people should prioritize drinking over working out.\n\"Keep in mind that I start studying people when they\u2019re 90,\" Kawas said at the conference. \"I think it\u2019s very likely that individuals who have very excessive alcohol intake at younger ages don\u2019t even make it to their 90s.\"\nThe \"About Us\" page on higherperspectives.com said \"everything contained on our website is an opinion formed by a well-informed group \u2014 but it\u2019s still just an opinion \u2014 not fact or news of the who, what, when, etc.\"\nIn this case, the story\u2019s headline is wrong.
