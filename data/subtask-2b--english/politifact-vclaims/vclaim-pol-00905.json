Boeing lists three major American airlines that currently use the 737 Max \u2014\u00a0American (24 planes), Southwest (34 planes) and United (14 planes). The FAA said it made the decision after seeing \"new evidence gathered at the site and analyzed today.\" The United States was the last holdout as other national air safety agencies\u00a0from China to the European Union moved to ground the plane.\nThe crash of an Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737-Max 8 led several lawmakers to call for the immediate grounding of that plane in the United States. Ethiopian Air Flight 302 disappeared from air controllers\u2019 screens about six minutes after takeoff from Addis Ababa on a flight to Nairobi, Kenya. All 157 passengers died.\nDemocratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren was among those calling for immediate action.\n\"The United Kingdom, China, Australia, South Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia and others have already grounded the 737 Max,\" Warren said in a March 12 news release. \"The world has now witnessed the second tragic crash of one of these planes in less than six months.\u00a0The FAA should follow their lead, reverse their decision, and immediately ground this plane in the United States until its safety can be assured. While we do not know the causes of these crashes, serious questions have been raised about whether these planes were pressed into service without additional pilot training in order to save money. The FAA itself has indicated that software updates are likely coming. Any necessary changes must be made before, not after, more flights occur and more lives are potentially endangered.\"\nWarren\u2019s point about the FAA\u00a0and software bears out.\nOn March 11, the Federal Aviation Administration posted an airworthiness notification. While it emphasized that the investigation has just begun, it said it was keeping an eye on \"Boeing\u2019s completion of the flight control system enhancements.\"\nThe FAA listed three software elements where it expected changes in what is called the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System. That system activates automatically, mainly during takeoff, when the plane is rising rapidly. (It was built to compensate for larger changes in the aircraft that made it more fuel efficient, but also affected how it handled when its nose is pointed up at a sharp angle.)\u00a0There is speculation that the automated system contributed to the crash.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than keeping an eye on Boeing\u2019s progress, the statement said \"the FAA anticipates mandating these design changes by (airworthiness directive) no later than April 2019.\"\nAn airworthiness directive is a big deal. It\u2019s a legally enforceable rule \"to correct an unsafe condition.\"\n\"When the FAA wrote that, it was telling Boeing to make those changes as soon as possible,\" Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University aviation safety professor William Waldock told us.\nBoeing complied. It announced March 11 that it was deploying software changes to the entire 737 Max fleet \"in the coming weeks.\" The changes were underway after the first 737 Max crash in Indonesia in October 2018. Among other things, they will reduce the automated adjustments in the plane\u2019s stabilizers (the moving parts on the tail of the airplane).\nBut Waldock underscored that until investigators sift through the data in the Ethiopian Air plane\u2019s black boxes and voice recorders, they won\u2019t know the actual cause of the disaster. It's possible that the software in question was not responsible.\nOur ruling\nWarren said the FAA had \"indicated that software changes\" were coming to the Boeing 737 Max 8 fleet. The FAA\u2019s airworthiness notice not only indicated that such changes were on their way, it telegraphed that those modifications would be mandatory by the end of April.\nWe rate this statement True.\n Share the Facts 2019-03-12 21:20:53 UTC   PolitiFact    6 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: True  The Boeing 737 Max 8, the type of plane that crashed in Ethiopia, continues to fly in the United States, despite the FAA saying \"software updates are likely coming.\"     Elizabeth Warren Democratic Senator from Massachusetts https://mailchi.mp/0fbaff678b07/warren-statement-on-boeing?e=3b03a2797e   In a press release.
