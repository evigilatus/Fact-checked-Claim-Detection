The irregularities, the NCGOP argued, didn\u2019t affect enough votes to make a difference in the outcome of the race.\nFast forward to March. The NC elections board has called a special election in the 9th district, and the GOP is raising money to help whoever its candidate ends up being in September.\nIn doing so, the party is misleading donors about the history of the race. A March 12 fundraising email warns supporters about \"horrible news.\"\n\"Democrats have forced a special election in North Carolina, and the race is tied!\" the email says in bold print.\n\nIs the race tied? Only in the sense that no candidates have emerged yet from their party\u2019s primary.\nWe\u2019ll also address whether Democrats \"forced\" a special election. But first, some important dates: the primary will take place May 14 and the general election will be on Sept. 10. If no candidate gets 30 percent of the vote in the primary, a runoff election will be held Sept. 10, followed by a general election Nov. 5.\nNow, let\u2019s talk about how we got here. The GOP says Democrats \"forced\" a special election \u2014 which gives the impression that support for a new election was purely partisan.\nIt wasn\u2019t.\nHOW IT HAPPENED\nThe NC elections board has jurisdiction over races for federal office across the state.\nIn November, the board was made up of nine members \u2014 four Republicans, four Democrats and a\u00a0left-leaning unaffiliated member\u00a0\u2014 when it voted 7-2 against certifying the 9th district race results.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJenna Wadsworth\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth Carolina Secretary of State Elaine Marshall \"has won more statewide races than probably anyone else alive.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Paul Specht \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn\u00a0January, a court decision reconstituted the board with five members:\u00a0three Democrats and two Republicans.\nIn February, after a four-day hearing on the findings of the fraud investigation, the reconstituted board voted unanimously (5-0) to nullify November\u2019s results and launch a new election. The board acted shortly after Harris, in a surprise move, expressed his support for a new election.\n\"It\u2019s become clear to me that the public\u2019s confidence in the Ninth District\u2019s general election has been undermined to an extent that a new election is warranted,\" Harris said, and the\u00a0New York Times reported.\nA GOP-BACKED DECISION\nDallas Woodhouse, executive director of the NC GOP, pointed out that Democrats controlled the elections board.\n\"Republicans could not force a special election, and could not certify alone,\" Woodhouse said.\nHowever, state law required four of the five board members to OK a new election, according to board spokesman Patrick Gannon. So Republicans had an influence on the decision to call for a new election. And the two Republican members of the board voted for a new election shortly after Harris (the Republican candidate) said he also supported it.\nFurthermore, on the day Harris called for a new election, Woodhouse said he supported Harris\u2019 decision.\n\"Today I ask for everyone\u2019s prayers for\u00a0@MarkHarrisNC9\u00a0Today is a tremendously difficult day for his family, supporters and the entire\u00a0@NCGOP\u00a0We support our candidates decision in this matter. We will do everything we can to help the process and system improve in the future,\" Woodhouse\u00a0tweeted\u00a0on Feb. 21.\nIn a statement released the same day,\u00a0the NC GOP said \"we respect Dr. Harris\u2019 decision\"\u00a0and thanked the elections board. And on Feb. 26, after Harris dropped out of contention for the seat, the GOP put out another statement saying, \"This has been a grueling process for all involved, and\u00a0we unequivocally support his call for a new election.\"\n\nOUR\u00a0RULING\nAn NC GOP fundraising email said \"Democrats have forced a special election\" in the 9th Congressional District. Democrats held a majority on the NC elections board, but the vote to order a new election was supported by the board\u2019s two Republican members and the Republican candidate.
