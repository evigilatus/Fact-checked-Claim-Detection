The Facebook article, which was actually a Twitter footage, was referred to as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation in the broadcast of the news. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It is a common strategy to attack politicians for their legislative record. The article was shared thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter, so we wanted to check it out. It should be noted that it does not contain confirmation of Amy Klobochar, the other senator who competes for the presidency. The telegraph in the Facebook article was originally published by Mark Simon shortly after midnight on March 14th. Simon is the host of a dialogue program that maintains WOR, a radio station based in New York City. We contacted Simon to get the sources behind his tweet, but we didn't hear a reply. This article is inaccurate and paints an incomplete picture of the effectiveness of politicians. Tweet misinterprets the legislative record of this fact-checking, and we first used the more stringent definition of the word \"transit\" - legislation signed by the President - to assess the validity of this position. We then looked at the number of bills approved by the Senate at least. We looked at each senator's record at the time of Simon's tweeting to find out. Their records are as follows on 13 March, the last working day before the original mail, according to Guftrak, a website that keeps the legislation in force in Congress informed. Cin, Cory Booker, D.N.J. Submitted by: 113 outgoing senators: 1 signed by President: 2 O. Kamala Harris, D. Presented: 56 Senates: 2 signed by President: 0 Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. On January 10, 2021, 108 photocopies were presented in a Facebook article that says that Nancy Belusi sent a letter to the Mayor of Portland after demonstrations there, \"Forcing him to stick to a proven democratic playbook.\" By Sierra Aurork \u2022 January 11, 2021 the Senate: 2 signed by President 0. These numbers are close, but not exactly what Simon shared. Harris has introduced a little more legislation than the radio host claimed in his tweet, while Booker and Warren have introduced a few fewer pieces of legislation. It is possible that Simon used a separate source that counted each senator's bills differently. But we don't know for sure that he didn't come back to us. However, all members of the Senate have introduced legislation that was passed by the Senate at least on 13 March. Even Booker had two bills signed by President Barack Obama. It is therefore inaccurate to say that none of them had been billed until March 13. The re-publishing of this allegation on Facebook six months after it was originally issued is not accurate. Finally, some experts doubt the hypothesis of calculating the number of bills proposed by legislators. Norman Orentin, a resident scientist at the American Institute of Enterprise, said in an e-mail: \"The draft laws are very limited and often a questionable way to judge effectiveness.\" \"This basic legislation is now being implemented in draft omnibus laws, where much is being done through amendments. The divided government is blocking minority legislators, especially now in this tribal era.\" \"There are many, many other ways to be effective.\" For example, in 2018, the Boston Globe published dozens of examples or so that Warren could indicate that she worked with the Republicans to get bills for Trump's office. \"I have introduced legislation with Senator Chuck Grasley of Iowa to make hearing aids available, for example. She co-sponsored the \"Smart Savings Act\" with Senator Rob Portman of Ohio to enhance the savings of federal officials; a draft law on opiates with Chile Moore Cabito of West Virginia; and with John Cornen of Texas, legislation to facilitate the acquisition of commercial driving licences by veterans,\" wrote the Globe. In the meantime, Boker is credited with assisting in the passage of the first step law, a criminal justice reform bill signed into law by Trump. Booker was a co-sponsor of the legislation, which reflected the strict drug sentencing guidelines adopted in the 1980s and 1990s. The attacks by Sanders on the legislative records of legislators are very common. As well as slandering Sanders' life and occupation. Allegations such as those written on Facebook, that Sanders \"didn't have a job until he was 53\" and that \"he lived far from welfare and four different women,\" We evaluated a similar situation in March. In that fact-checking, we noted that after graduation from the University of Chicago in 1964, Sanders held a variety of individual jobs, including carpentry and preschool. These jobs are likely to be part-time, but part-time work is not comparable to unemployment. Relevant story: The verification of the facts in the presidential democratic debate in Houston also found no evidence to support the claim that Sanders lived far from welfare, which generally consists of several government programmes designed to assist low-income individuals, before being elected. An earlier spokesman for his campaign told us that this assertion had been made. There were media reports that Saunders collected unemployment benefits in 1974, the second time he was nominated to the United States Senate representing Vermont. Only 4.1 per cent of the vote was won that year, partly because he campaigned as a member of the Freedom Union Party, which advocates democratic socialism. Sanders also made unsuccessful presentations to the Governor of Vermont in 1972, 1976 and 1986. He served as Mayor of Borlington, F., from 1981 to 1989, before joining the United States House of Representatives in 1991. In 2006, he was elected a member of the Senate. The source of the allegation that Sanders lived with \"four different women\" is unclear. The senator had been married twice, but there was no evidence that they were the main breadwinners. Our Facebook article claimed, \"In Congress, Elizabeth Warren submitted 110 bills. It's passed 2. Cory Booker made 120 bills. 0 times. Kamala Harris submitted 54 bills. 0 times. Bernie Sanders didn't have a job until he was 53. He lived away from care and four different women. After the attack on the legislative effectiveness of Democrats in the Senate. The original tweet was also inaccurate; at that time, all of those senators had submitted bills that had been passed in the Senate. The president even signed two poker bills. With regard to Saunders, this position invents several parts of the Senator's curriculum vitae. The Facebook mail is inaccurate. We assess it wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00114"}
