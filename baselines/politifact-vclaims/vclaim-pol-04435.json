Her initial support for the deal wasn\u2019t as clear or as strongly stated as the blog says.\nWe decided to weigh her statements on PolitiFact\u2019s Flip-O-Meter, which examines a candidate\u2019s record on a topic without casting a value judgment on any changes.\nRepublicans have sought to tie Democrats (including in Nevada) to the 2015 diplomatic arrangement with Iran, which aims to extend the time it takes for the country to make a nuclear bomb in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions.\nRosen, a former Henderson synagogue leader and political newcomer, has addressed the deal publicly on just a handful of occasions.\nShe made her first remarks about the deal in an interview (audio) with the Las Vegas Sun and a PolitiFact Nevada reporter in April, saying Obama \"made the best deal\" he could.\n\"Just being an ordinary citizen, I do believe that he made the best deal that\u00a0he thought he could at the time or he probably wouldn't have made it,\" she said at the time. \"That being said, it doesn't mean that we don't watch everything they do. It doesn't mean that we don't watch where money gets invested into Iran. Where they're spending their money. It doesn't mean that we don't keep watching them. It doesn't mean we don't keep improving on the agreement where we have to or imposing sanctions where we have to.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHarry Reid\n\n\nstated on February 19, 2010 in a television interview with Las Vegas political analyst Jon Ralston\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have solved the problem. ... Scientists are now saying leave the nuclear waste where it is.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 February 22, 2010\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA month later, Rosen again addressed the deal, but this time she struck a different tone. She told political reporter Jon Ralston that she would have voted against the deal had she been in Congress at the time.She said it said didn\u2019t reflect a change in position.\n\"I guess as I have had a chance to think about and clarify it, it hasn\u2019t changed,\" she said. \"I did say I want to hold their feet to the fire, I want to look at where the money goes, and I don\u2019t want a nuclearized Iran.\"\nPolitiFact reached out to the Rosen campaign, which provided a statement from the candidate saying that her position on the deal has been \"clear and consistent.\"\nTo help prove the point, the campaign also provided an email exchange from late March to early April between Rosen campaign manager David Furr\u00a0and a staff member at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee over an Israel policy paper including her position on the Iran deal.\nThe paper reflects what Rosen said to Ralston in May.\n\"If Jacky had been in Congress when the vote on the Iran deal had occurred, she would have opposed the deal,\" the paper reads. \"But now that it has been agreed, the United States must demand that Iran abide by the agreement completely, and any cheating or subversion of the agreement should be dealt with swiftly.\"\nA few caveats do apply \u2014 this paper wasn\u2019t previously available publicly, so there would be no way for voters to know her position. Rosen also doesn\u2019t list any foreign policy positions (or any issues, for that matter) on her website.\nOur ruling\nRosen has only been quoted a handful of times on the Iran deal. In April, she expressed measured support of the deal (without using the word \"support\"), saying she believed it was the best deal Obama could have reached, and that it could be improved. Her view the next month was more articulated. She said she would have voted against it as a member of Congress.\nBecause she has partially changed her position, we rate Rosen\u2019s position as Half Flip.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04435"}
