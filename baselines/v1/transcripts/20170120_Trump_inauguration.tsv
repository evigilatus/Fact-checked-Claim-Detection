0001	Donald Trump	Chief Justice Roberts, President Carter, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, fellow Americans and people of the world, thank you.
0002	Donald Trump	We, the citizens of America are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and restore its promise for all of our people.
0003	Donald Trump	Together, we will determine the course of America and the world for many, many years to come.
0004	Donald Trump	We will face challenges.
0005	Donald Trump	We will confront hardships, but we will get the job done.
0006	Donald Trump	Every four years we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power.
0007	Donald Trump	And we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition.
0008	Donald Trump	They have been magnificent.
0009	Donald Trump	Thank you.
0010	Donald Trump	Todays ceremony however, has very special meaning, because today, we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another or from one party to another, but we are transferring power from Washington, DC.
0011	Donald Trump	And giving it back to you, the people.
0012	Donald Trump	For too long, have reaped the rewards of government while people have borne the cost.
0013	Donald Trump	Washington flourished, but the people did not share in its wealth.
0014	Donald Trump	Politicians prospered period, but the jobs left and the factories closed.
0015	Donald Trump	The establishment protected itself but not the citizens of our country.
0016	Donald Trump	Their victories have not been your victories.
0017	Donald Trump	Their triumphs have not been your triumphs and while they celebrated in our nation's capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.
0018	Donald Trump	That all changes starting right here and right now, because this moment is your moment.
0019	Donald Trump	It belongs to you.
0020	Donald Trump	It be longs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across America.
0021	Donald Trump	This is your day.
0022	Donald Trump	This is your celebration.
0023	Donald Trump	And this, the United States of America, is your country.
0024	Donald Trump	What truly matters is not what truly controls our government but whether our government is controlled by the people.
0025	Donald Trump	January 20, 2017 will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again.
0026	Donald Trump	The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.
0027	Donald Trump	Everyone is listening to you now, you came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement, the likes of which the world has never seen before.
0028	Donald Trump	At the center of this movement is a crucial conviction, that a nation exists to serve its citizens.
0029	Donald Trump	Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families and good jobs for themselves.
0030	Donald Trump	These are just and reasonable demands of righteous people and a righteous public.
0031	Donald Trump	But for too many of our citizens, a different reality exists.
0032	Donald Trump	Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities, rustedout factories, scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation, an education system flush with cash but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge.
0033	Donald Trump	And the crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.
0034	Donald Trump	This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.
0035	Donald Trump	We are one nation and their pain is our pain.
0036	Donald Trump	Their dreams are our dreams and their success will be our success.
0037	Donald Trump	We share one heart, one home and one glorious destiny.
0038	Donald Trump	The oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans.
0039	Donald Trump	For many decades, we have enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry, subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military.
0040	Donald Trump	We have defended other nations' borders while refusing to defend our own.
0041	Donald Trump	And spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas while America's infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay.
0042	Donald Trump	Weve made other countries rich while the wealth, strength and confidence of our country has dissipated over the horizon.
0043	Donald Trump	One by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores with not even a thought about the millions and millions of American workers that were left behind.
0044	Donald Trump	The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed all across the world.
0045	Donald Trump	But that is the pass and now we are looking only to the future.
0046	Donald Trump	We assemble here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city in every foreign capital and in every hall of power.
0047	Donald Trump	From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land.
0048	Donald Trump	From this day forward, it's going to be only America first, America first.
0049	Donald Trump	Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs will be made to benefit American workers and American families.
0050	Donald Trump	We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies and destroying our jobs.
0051	Donald Trump	Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength.
0052	Donald Trump	I will fight for you with every breath in my body.
0053	Donald Trump	And I will never ever let you down.
0054	Donald Trump	America will start winning again, winning like never before.
0055	Donald Trump	We will bring back our jobs.
0056	Donald Trump	We will bring back our borders.
0057	Donald Trump	We will bring back our wealth.
0058	Donald Trump	And we will bring back our dreams.
0059	Donald Trump	We will build new roads and highways and bridges and airports and tunnels and railways all across our wonderful nation.
0060	Donald Trump	We will get our people off of welfare and back to work, rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor.
0061	Donald Trump	We will follow two simple rules, buy American and hire American.We will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world, but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first.
0062	Donald Trump	We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example.
0063	Donald Trump	We will shine for everyone to follow.
0064	Donald Trump	We will reinforce old alliances and form new wurns and reform the world against radical islamic terrorism which we will eradicate from the face of the earth.
0065	Donald Trump	At the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America and through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other.
0066	Donald Trump	When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.
0067	Donald Trump	The Bible tells us how good and pleasant it is when god's people live together in unity.
0068	Donald Trump	We must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly, but always pursue sold art.
0069	Donald Trump	When America is united, America is totally unstoppable.
0070	Donald Trump	There should be no fear.
0071	Donald Trump	We are protected and we will always be protected.
0072	Donald Trump	We will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement.
0073	Donald Trump	And most importantly, we will be protected by God.
0074	Donald Trump	Finally, must think big and dream even bigger.
0075	Donald Trump	In America, we understand that a nation is only living as long it is striving.
0076	Donald Trump	We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action, constantly complaining, but never doing anything about it.
0077	Donald Trump	The time for empty talk is over.
0078	Donald Trump	Now arrives the hour of action.
0079	Donald Trump	Do not allow anyone to tell you that it cannot be done.
0080	Donald Trump	No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America.
0081	Donald Trump	We will not fail.
0082	Donald Trump	Our country will thrive and prosper again.
0083	Donald Trump	We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the earth from the missries of disease and harness the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow.
0084	Donald Trump	A new national pride will stir ourselves, lift our sights and heal our divisions.
0085	Donald Trump	It's time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget, that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots.
0086	Donald Trump	We all enjoy the same glorious freedoms.
0087	Donald Trump	And we all salute the same great American flag.
0088	Donald Trump	And whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept plains of nebraska, they look at the same night sky.
0089	Donald Trump	They fill their heart with the same dreams and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty creator.
0090	Donald Trump	So to all Americans in every city near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, from ocean to ocean, hear these words, you will never be ignored again.
0091	Donald Trump	Your voice, your hopes and your dreams will define our American destiny.
0092	Donald Trump	And your courage, goodness and love will forever guide us along the way.
0093	Donald Trump	Together, we will make america strong again.
0094	Donald Trump	We will make america wealthy again.
0095	Donald Trump	We will make america proud again.
0096	Donald Trump	We will make America safe again.
