Castro was the Mayor of San Antonio, Texas, and served as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development in the past few years in the Obama administration. In an article on the Internet, he recounted the background of his family's immigrants, criticized the Tramp \"zero tolerance\" policy in the area of migration and called for access to citizenship for an estimated 11 million people living illegally in the United States. Castro confirmed that what he said was a little known policy, but it's important, Section 1325, \"central to today's inhumane and flawed immigration system.\" He said that the law dated back to the 1920s and received a new boost during George W. Bush's presidency. \"These laws gained a new life in 2005, when the Bush administration decided to charge those who crossed the border with criminal, rather than civil, violations,\" Castro wrote in an average publication published in April 1. Did Castro accurately describe the practice of the Bush administration? We found that some migrants had been prosecuted for improper entry even before 2005. In 2005, however, the Bush Administration launched a programme to prosecute most migrants before their deportation. The Castro Statement is precise but needs clarification. Castro's immigration policy \"People First\" highlights section 1325.8 of the United States Code, which defines the legal consequences of migrants entering or attempting to enter the United States at a time or place not specified by immigration authorities; those who evade screening or inspection by immigration officials; and those who enter or attempt to enter the United States under false claims. For the first offence of any of these offences, a person may be fined or imprisoned for a maximum of six months, or both. Subsequent offences may result in a fine or imprisonment of up to two years, or both. The law has been in existence for decades. On February 1, 2021, Tom Cotton mentioned in an interview with Fox and friends \"Many of these arriving immigrants, we have no way of checking their background for either health or security.\" By Miriam Valverdi, 3 February 2021, the process of streamlining the Bush process was what Castro had in mind when he referred to the 2005 political changes by the Bush administration, and said his campaign. The programme allowed border guards to refer to trial all individuals arrested at the border, with the exception of parents travelling with minors and juveniles and choosing others. This programme has been initiated in response to the increasing incidence of illegal entry of persons from countries other than Mexico. Before 2004, the Border Patrol referred a limited number of immigrants to the Ministry of Justice for criminal prosecution, and cited a report issued by the Inspector General &apos; s Office in the Ministry of Internal Security in 2015. Historically, the Government has generally returned most Mexican citizens to Mexico through the voluntary repatriation process, administratively detaining migrants and treating them for deportation through the civil migration system, as mentioned in the report. The prosecutions under section 1325 were distorted and flowed to different departments; not all were carried out in the same way, as Brian Osley, Assistant Professor of Law at the University of North Texas in Dallas, the Law School and former Justice of the Peace in the United States of America for the South Texas region. One of the reasons why Article 1325 was used before and after 2005 was to get people into the federal criminal system - if someone came inappropriately again, they could then be charged with illegal return (crime), Osley said. All Clinton, Bush and Obama administrations have prosecuted immigrants under section 1325. The Trump administration, too. The Trump policy of \"zero tolerance\" in prosecution is said to have been formulated after the simplification process. However, Trump &apos; s policy differs from that of other departments in that it led to the separation of thousands of children from their parents. After the public protest against the secessions, Trump signed an executive order to preserve families together, \"where appropriate and consistent with the law,\" based on available resources. It did not put an end to the prosecutorial policy. The immigration experts stressed that migration is usually a civil matter - entry on a legitimate basis for asylum, for example, is not a criminal act, and these cases are reviewed by the immigration courts of the Ministry of Justice. However, Bush was not the first to prosecute immigrants for their illegal entry into the United States or the only one to try them. Our judgment, Castro, said that in 2005 the Bush administration \"decided to charge those who crossed the border with criminal, rather than civil, violations.\" Migrants who crossed the border illegally for immigration offences had been prosecuted even before 2005. However, the Bush administration introduced the simplification process in late 2005 to prosecute most illegal cross-border migrants. The Castro Statement is precise but requires further clarification or information. We're mostly assessing it right.
