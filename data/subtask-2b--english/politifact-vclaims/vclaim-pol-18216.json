But \"probably tens of thousands\" of people would be dead now if he hadn\u2019t done so, he claimed on Fox News March 24.\nAt the same time, he\u2019s claimed that former Vice President Joe Biden, a contender for the Democratic nomination for president, called him racist and xenophobic for restricting entry from China.\n\"I had Biden calling me xenophobic,\" Trump said on Sean Hannity\u2019s Fox News prime-time show March 26. \"He called me a racist, because of the fact that he felt it was a racist thing to stop people from China coming in.\"\nTrump has said that about Biden at least three other times \u2014 on Twitter, at a White House briefing, and during the Fox News town hall.\nBut Biden has not directly said that the travel restriction was xenophobic. He has used that phrase in reference to Trump and his handling of the coronavirus outbreak. Biden\u2019s campaign told PolitiFact that Biden\u2019s tweets were not specific to the restrictions on people coming from China.\nBiden\u2019s use of the word \"xenophobic\"\nThe White House press office said Trump\u2019s claim is supported by a tweet Biden posted Feb. 1, the day after the Trump administration announced travel restrictions on people who were in China 14 days prior to their attempted entry into the United States.\nBiden tweeted: \"We are in the midst of a crisis with the coronavirus. We need to lead the way with science \u2014 not Donald Trump\u2019s record of hysteria, xenophobia, and fear-mongering. He is the worst possible person to lead our country through a global health emergency.\"\nBut Biden did not explicitly tie xenophobia to the travel restriction. His tweet reflects coronavirus remarks he made during a campaign stop in Iowa Jan. 31, the day the travel restrictions were announced.\nBiden said: \"This is no time for Donald Trump's record of hysteria xenophobia, hysterical xenophobia, and fear-mongering to lead the way instead of science.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiden again used the word \"xenophobic\" in March \u2014 once at a press conference and once in response to a Trump tweet. In the first, Biden was criticizing Trump for labeling coronavirus a \"foreign\" virus. In the second, it\u2019s not clear whether Biden\u2019s use of the word was in direct reference to the travel restriction.\nDuring a March 12 press conference Biden said, the United States should not be overly dismissive of the outbreak, \"but neither should we panic or fall back on xenophobia, labeling COVID-19 a foreign virus does not displace accountability for the misjudgments that have been taken thus far by the Trump administration.\"\nEarlier that day, the Trump campaign tweeted that Democrats and news outlets were \"accusing President Trump of racism and xenophobia\" for his use of the phrase \"Chinese virus.\"\nOn March 18, Trump tweeted: \"I always treated the Chinese Virus very seriously, and have done a very good job from the beginning, including my very early decision to close the \u2018borders\u2019 from China - against the wishes of almost all. Many lives were saved. The Fake News new narrative is disgraceful & false!\"\nBiden replied the same day: \"Stop the xenophobic fear-mongering. Be honest. Take responsibility. Do your job.\"\nStop the xenophobic fear-mongering. Be honest. Take responsibility. Do your job. https://t.co/nQ5aLVrpyb\u2014 Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) March 18, 2020 \nThe tweet that Biden responded to included the phrase \"Chinese virus,\" which experts say could foster discrimination toward people of Chinese or Asian origin.\nAndrew Bates, a Biden campaign spokesman, said Biden \"has decried Trump's xenophobia for years, and was saying that it shouldn't influence the U.S. approach to this outbreak. This was not in reference to coronavirus travel restrictions.\"\nTravel restrictions that are supported by science, advocated by public health officials, and backed by a full strategy can be warranted, Bates said.\nOur ruling\nSpeaking of his restriction on travel from China, Trump said, \"I had Biden calling me xenophobic. \u2026 . He called me a racist, because of the fact that he felt it was a racist thing to stop people from China coming in.\"\nBiden has not directly said that the restrictions were xenophobic. Around the time the Trump administration announced the travel restriction, Biden said that Trump had a \"record of hysteria, xenophobia, and fear-mongering.\" Biden used the phrase \"xenophobic\" in reply to a Trump tweet about limiting entry to travelers from China and in which he described the coronavirus as the \"Chinese virus.\" Biden did not spell out which part of Trump\u2019s tweet was xenophobic.\nTrump\u2019s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.
