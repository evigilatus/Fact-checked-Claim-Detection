Cora Faith Walker, D-Ferguson, wrote that funding cuts to Medicaid programs would further hurt African-American communities.\n\n\n\"The average life expectancy for African-Americans in Saint Louis and Saint Louis County varies by as much as 18 years compared to the white population, with nearly half of all African-American kids under the age of 18 living in poverty,\" Walker wrote.\n\n\nThose are striking statistics, so we reached out to Walker to find out where she got them. She sent us a copy of\u00a0a 2015 \"For the Sake of All\" report, which analyzes \"the health and well-being of African Americans in St. Louis.\" Walker also outlined the primary sources cited in the report.\n\n\nWe reached out to the report\u2019s project directors to find out where these stats came from.\n\n\nLife expectancy\n\n\nWalker wrote that the average life expectancy for African-Americans in St. Louis City and St. Louis County varies by as much as 18 years compared to the white population.\n\n\nWhere does that information come from?\n\n\nFor the Sake of All project director Jason Purnell told us the figure comes from a comparison between residents in the ZIP code 63106 in the city and the ZIP\u00a0zip code 63105 in the county.\n\n\nFor the Sake of All\u2019s report breaks down the differences in life expectancy for different ZIP\u00a0 codes within St. Louis city and county. On page 27 of the report, a map showing life expectancy at birth by ZIP code is accompanied by this description:\n\n\n\"A child born in 63106 near the Jeff-Vander-Lou neighborhood can expect to live 18 fewer years than a child born in 63105 (Clayton), 15 fewer years than a child born in 63017 (Chesterfield), 14 fewer years than children born in 63122 (Kirkwood) and 63109 (St. Louis Hills), and 3 years fewer than a child born in 63133 (Pagedale/Wellston),\" the report says.\n\n\nResearch Project Coordinator Rachel Barth said the life expectancies were constructed using a calculator developed by the City of St. Louis Department of Health \u2013 Center for Health Information, Planning, and Research, and life expectancies by ZIP code were derived using population counts from the 2010 Census and deaths from\u00a0the Missouri Information for Community Assessment\u2019s 2010 data.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo be clear, the data aren\u2019t comparing life expectancies by race. Walker is extrapolating that based on what she knows about the ZIP\u00a0 codes analyzed. The report notes that the areas with lowest life expectancies \u2014 such as ZIP code 63106 that has an average life expectancy of 67 years \u2014 \"are also in areas with the highest concentration of African-American population.\"\n\n\n\"We do not have calculations for life expectancy by race,\" Barth told PolitiFact Missouri.\n\n\nHowever, ZIP code 63105, which includes Clayton, is predominately white \u2014 which is where Walker may have based her assertion \"compared to the white population.\"\n\n\n\"What I think Rep. Walker is getting at is the life expectancy for residents living in 63106 (95 percent of whom are African-American) is 67 years, whereas the life expectancy for residents living in 63105 (92 percent of whom are white) is 85 years of age,\" Barth said.\n\n\nTo summarize, Walker is comparing ZIP\u00a0 codes in the St. Louis area and identifying where the greatest life expectancy disparity exists. Those ZIP\u00a0 codes align with overwhelmingly African-American or white populations. However, there may be other variables that weren\u2019t considered in the study that have an effect on the average life expectancy.\n\n\nPoverty\n\n\nWalker went on to say that \"nearly half of all African-American kids under the age of 18 (are) living in poverty.\"\n\n\nThat\u2019s from the same report, but the statistic is outdated and relies on 2012 Census information. In 2012, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, 46 percent of African-American children under 18 lived in poverty in St. Louis County and St. Louis City, Barth said.\n\n\nAccording to the more recent Census Bureau estimate from 2016, the figure has fallen to 33 percent, Barth said. The decrease coincides with the improvement of the economy in Missouri.\n\n\nOur ruling\n\n\nWalker said \"the average life expectancy for African Americans in Saint Louis and Saint Louis County varies by as much as 18 years compared to the white population, with nearly half of all African-American kids under the age of 18 living in poverty.\"\n\n\nWalker based this assertion on a study showing a wide difference in life expectancy between two ZIP codes within the city and county of St. Louis. That\u2019s not exactly a comparison of life expectancy by race, but given that one ZIP code is heavily African-American and the other is heavily white, it\u2019s a reasonable proxy.\n\n\nAs for the poverty claim, the rate remains high, but the 50 percent figure is based on old data. More recent estimates find that about a third of African-American children in the St. Louis area are living in poverty.\n\n\nOn balance, we rate this claim\u00a0Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02567"}
