By now, most of you have probably heard about the controversy surrounding former NAACP leader Rachel Dolezal, who self-identifies as black but has white parents.\nDolezal\u2019s \"passing\" for black unleashed criticism that Dolezal used her racial identity as it suited her, a tool for progressing her own goals. One CNN article reported that some people felt that Dolezal had \"diminished the real struggles of African-Americans by claiming she had suffered hurtful racism like them.\"\nCount Michael Skolnik, Russell Simmons\u2019 political director and the president of GlobalGrind.com, among that group.\nDolezal \"took the space of a black woman, who could have been a leader of (the NAACP). ... Black people in this country don\u2019t have that convenience,\" Skolnik said in a June 16\u00a0interview\u00a0with CNN's Brooke Baldwin. \"In fact, for most black people in the history of this country who passed, it was illegal to pass as a white person. You were actually put in jail if you tried to pass. For black people, passing was about survival, it wasn\u2019t about acceptance.\"\nLeaving aside the question of Dolezal\u2019s actions, PunditFact was struck by Skolnik\u2019s statement that\u00a0\"it was illegal to pass as a white person (and) you were actually put in jail if you tried to pass.\"\u00a0Was it illegal to pass as a white person? And was jail the consequence?\nThe short answer is that experts say there were never laws explicity saying African-Americans could not pass a white person. But if discovered, those people passing as white would be subject to laws on the books for African-Americans, many of which could include jail time.\nPassing as white\nFirst, we have to address the question of what it meant to be black in the United States in the 19th and 20th centuries. In his book Who is Black? One Nation\u2019s Definition, author F. James Davis stated that \"the nation's answer to the question 'Who is black?\" has long been that a black is any person with any known African black ancestry \u2026 In the South it became known as the \u2018one-drop rule,\u2019 meaning that a single drop of \u2018black blood\u2019 makes a person a black.\"\nUsing this rule, a person who identified as white could be accused of being black if any information or documents surfaced claiming that he or she had a black ancestor. Virginia's Bureau of Vital Statistics registrar\u00a0Walter Plecker, for instance, became infamous in Virginia during the 20th century for using birth and death certificates, data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Confederate War Department, as well as other sources to determine who had any \"colored\" blood.\nBecause of this, fair-skinned individuals who could pass for white would be legally identified as black.\nSkolnik told us he was referring specifically to slave times. \"If a slave tried to pass for white and was caught, they were oftentimes jailed and sent back to their slave masters,\" Skolnik said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s true, though not because they passed as white, but because they were declared\u00a0someone else's property.\u00a0Under the Fugitive Slave Acts in place until the Civil War, citizens and local governments were under the obligation to capture and return slaves to their owners. Failure to do so would result in penalties.\nJail and other consequences\nAfter the Civil War came the rise of\u00a0black codes and\u00a0Jim Crow laws. While these laws were designed to create different sets of rules for blacks and whites on everything from marriage to education to the use of public facilities, they didn't target blacks specifically for passing as white.\nEvelyn Brooks Higginbotham is a\u00a0Harvard University professor of history and African American studies.\u00a0\n\"I don\u2019t believe that passing itself, although it remained the focus of numerous court cases, ended generally in imprisonment unless attached to another illegal practice, such as interracial marriage, theft, etc.,\" Higginbotham\u00a0said.\u00a0\"The consequences of being exposed were usually being put out of a school, losing one\u2019s job, sued for divorce, denied access to public accommodations, and disgraced in one\u2019s former social circles.\"\nMartha S. Jones, associate chair of the Department of Afroamerican and African Studies at the University of Michigan, agreed.\u00a0\"The consequences for attempting to \u2018pass\u2019 were that one might be denied a license to marry, or \u2026 one might be denied entry into the United States or naturalization as a citizen if discovered to be passing,\" Jones said.\nIn Florida, for example, it was illegal for a black man or woman to cohabitate with a white man or woman, and the punishment included up to one year in prison. But the crime wasn't passing as white.\nElizabeth Smith-Pryor, a history professor at Kent State University, explained one such case for us. Under Alabama law, people\u00a0could be imprisoned if found to be married to someone of the other race. In 1935, in the case of\u00a0Keith vs. Commonwealth,\u00a0Keith was accused of having a black ancestor -- and therefore being black --\u00a0making his marriage to a white woman illegal. The court ultimately ruled there was not enough evidence to convict.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nSkolnik said that \"for most black people in the history of this country who passed, it was illegal to pass as a white person. You were actually put in jail if you tried to pass.\"\nSkolnik said he was referring to the Fugitive Slave Acts, which could result in prison time for runaway slaves until they were returned to their owner. But those acts had nothing\u00a0to do with passing as white, as slaves were considered property.\u00a0\nPost-Civil War Jim Crow laws did not include passing as white as a crime that could send someone to jail. However, blacks exposed as passing as white would be treated like other blacks under the law. And that, depending on the crime, could result in imprisonment.\u00a0\nSkolnik\u2019s statement is partially accurate. We rate it Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06296"}
