But that wasn't enough for some critics. His opponent, Patrick Morrisi, wrote in tweet, \"Thanks to @realDonaldTromp and the Republicans in the Senate who confirmed Kavanauh. Remember, Manchine refused to abide by Cavanaugh even after the Senate got the votes. And how much Mancheen: He didn't have the courage and strength of your circus Shomer. Wofson. Wofbull. Thanks to @realDonaldTromp and Republicans in the Senate who confirmed Cavanaugh. Remember, Manchine refused to abide by Cavanaugh even after the Senate got the votes. And how much Mancheen: He didn't have the courage and strength of your circus Shomer. #wvsen #wvpol - AG Patrick Morrisi (@MoreseyWV) 6 October 2018 Manchen ended up defeating Morrisi, despite a narrower margin than the polls indicated. Was Morrisi right that Manchin refused Cavanaugh's confirmation until after the Senate received votes in favor of Cavanaugh? Manchian employees did not respond to this article, but we took a closer look. On September 27th, Christine Blassie Ford accused Cavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when they were teenagers. This allegation jeopardized Cavanaugh's candidacy, and the Senate postponed an affirmative vote so that the FBI could investigate the allegation. Manchen supported the delay in voting by the Senate, which took time before he committed himself to approving or not voting on the nomination. He only announced his position after the investigation with the FBI was completed. On September 14, 2018, Joe Manchen stated on Twitter that Patrick Morrisi had made \"efforts to put educators in prison.\" \u2022 11 October, 2018, in the end, Manchen announced his intentions only after Sen Susan Collins, R. Maine, declared that she would support the 50th vote for Cavanaugh. That was enough to confirm that because Vice President Mike Pines could have broken a tie for Cavanaugh. Manchen made the announcement on 5 October, saying in a press release on Twitter at 3:54 p.m., \"I met the candidate for more than two hours, attended hearings, spoke with constitutional experts, and heard thousands of Western Virginians.\" That was \"within moments of\" Collins Declaration, CNN. Pulitico wrote that \"Manchin obviously does not want to be a 50th vote for Cavanaugh, but it seems to be fine with 51 or 52, without any new developments. Our rule, Morrisi, said that Manchen \"rejection of commitment to Cavanaugh even after the Senate has obtained the votes.\" He waited until Collins said that it would become the 50th vote to support Cavanaugh's candidacy to announce his decision to support it. We're evaluating the statement right.
