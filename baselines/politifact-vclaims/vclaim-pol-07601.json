The UNC study found mismanagement, such as excessive debt, contributed to the company and the \u00a0industry.\nIn November 2000, Pillowtex filed for bankruptcy after defaulting on a $650 million bank loan.\nThe firm emerged from bankruptcy in May 2002. Perdue arrived in July on the heels of sneaker success, having revived Reebok\u2019s finances as CEO.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Godlewski\n\n\nstated on January 9, 2021 in Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all women that lost jobs (in the December jobs report), it was mostly Black and Latina women. In fact, white women gained employment.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Nusaiba Mizan \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerdue told Pillowtex top leaders his plan was to improve sales through aggressive marketing and moving more work overseas, according to a Charlotte Observer investigation. A similar game plan catapulted his career at Sara Lee, which closed dozens of plants (including four in Georgia) while adding work in Asia.\nBut the company lost $27 million in the seven months after coming out of bankruptcy. Shortly after arriving, Perdue and top managers also found between $40-$50 million in pension liabilities missed in bankruptcy proceedings.\nIn March, 2003, Perdue left Pillowtex to become chief at Dollar General. Pillowtex shut down four months later. About 7,650 people lost their jobs nationwide, including 300 people who had been laid off in the first bankruptcy.\n\"I wouldn\u2019t call that turning things around the way most Georgians would want this country turned around,\" said Kingston spokesman Chris Crawford. \"If those are the kinds of results an outsider is going to deliver, let\u2019s keep him on the outside.\"\nBut is Perdue to blame for the closure? He served as Pillowtex\u2019s third leader in two years, as it was emerging from bankruptcy brought on by overwhelming debt and a changing industry.\nPerdue told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that the missed liabilities killed his plans for a turnaround \u00a0\u00a0\u2013 and any need for his leadership.\n\"I was not given the opportunity to turn it around as I had planned,\" Perdue said. \"There were factors beyond my control.\"\nThe experience didn\u2019t hurt Perdue\u2019s career, given his jump to Dollar General. It also didn\u2019t hurt his bottom line: records show he made $1.7 million for his brief leadership stint at Pillowtex at a time when people were losing their jobs.\nAnd that is the point Kingston misses in his claim. Pillowtex had laid off hundreds of workers and sought bankruptcy protection before Perdue ever arrived. It was a firm in bad shape that hired a business leaders known for rejuvenating industries \u2013 often through job losses.\nInvestors don\u2019t view that strategy as mismanagement, even if populists would object to it. Kingston would have been on firmer ground to make the populist point and let voters decide the merits.\nBut the claim of mismanagement is an overreach. Even the loss of jobs after Perdue left \u2013 closer to 7,000 \u2013 is overstated from what is sure a massive number.\nWe rate Kingston\u2019s statement as Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07601"}
