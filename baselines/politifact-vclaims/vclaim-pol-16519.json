And one of his frequent lines is: ''The free market is . . . one of our greatest assets. And the leading Democratic candidate once said that the unfettered free market is the most destructive force in modern America. I mean, just get an idea of where the philosophy comes from.''\n\nExcept Clinton never called the free market ''destructive.'' Giuliani is blatantly \u2014 and repeatedly \u2014 misquoting a line from her 1996 book,\n\nIt Takes a Village.\n\n\n\nIn the text, Clinton quotes author Alan Ehrenhalt, who wrote in his book\n\nThe Lost City:\n\n''The unfettered free market has been the most radically disruptive force in American life in the last generation.'' During a March 1996 interview on the C-SPAN program\n\nBook Notes,\n\nClinton said she agreed with the statement.\n\n\nBut the word ''disruptive'' is not the same as ''destructive'' in the context of the free market, said Ehrenhalt, executive editor of\n\nGoverning\n\nmagazine. The magazine is published by CQ and is an affiliate of the\n\nSt. Petersburg Times\n\n.\n\n\n\"There's no particular reason for a controversy,\" he said. \"But Giuliani is looking for anything to say against Hillary Clinton ... and he keeps distorting it.\"\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

''The market is the driving force behind our prosperity, our freedom ... (but) it cannot be permitted just to run roughshod over people's lives as well,'' she said.\n\n\nBecause of Giuliani's misquote, we give this a ruling of False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16519"}
