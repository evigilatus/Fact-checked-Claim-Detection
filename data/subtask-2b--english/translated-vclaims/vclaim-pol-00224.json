After months of accusations and counter-charges, both President Donald Trump and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani put forward the idea of meeting each other. In May 2018, Trump withdrew from the multinational agreement that restored Iran &apos; s nuclear programme and opened its facilities to international inspectors. At a subsequent press conference of the Group of Seven, along with French President Emmanuel McCrone, Trump said that the United States had \"a ridiculous deal\" with Iran. \"We gave them $150 billion,\" said Trump August 26. \"We gave them $1.8 billion, and we got nothing.\" We have already verified this and the figures, at best the $150 billion is small, while the $1.8 billion is reasonably accurate. But it's important to remember that whatever amount of money it involves, it started as Iran's money. The sanctions have been frozen since 1979. With regard to whether the United States \"got nothing\" from the deal, this view places zero value on the retreat from Iran's nuclear programme, which the agreement has achieved. The 2015 Agreement, which was called for by President Barack Obama at the time, freed Iranian assets frozen under the sanctions. The package, called the Joint Comprehensive Action Plan, included Iran, the United States, China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom and the European Union. The agreement affected only the sanctions imposed to punish Iran for its nuclear programme. Iran has other frozen assets that have not been affected by the transaction. Some governors have raised the amount released to $150 billion, the highest estimate we have seen. Another estimate issued by the Central Bank of Iran amounted to some $29 billion in readily available funds, with a further $45 billion linked to Chinese investment projects and foreign assets of the Iranian Ministry of Oil. After talking to officials of the Central Bank of Iran, Nader Habibi, Professor of Economics in the Middle East at the University of Brandes, Politifakt, in 2018, reported that the actual total was between $25 billion and $50 billion. In July 2015, US Treasury Secretary Jack told legislators that Iran would get $56 billion. Although Trump said that we gave Iran money, a little of that money was under the control of the United States or any American bank. My boyfriend said that most of them were located in central and commercial banks abroad. Furthermore, Iran &apos; s funds were initially, not a payment from any Government for Iran &apos; s cooperation. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 On 11 January 2021, the Congressional Research Service, the non-partisan analytical arm of Congress, reviewed the $1.7 billion cash transfer in a 2018 report. This is the sum settled by American and Iranian negotiators to resolve an arms contract between the United States and Iran prior to the Iranian Revolution in 1979. Iran had paid for military equipment and had never been delivered. In 1990, there were $400 million in that account. The negotiators agreed that the accumulated interest would add $1.3 billion to the amount - a lot of money - but 25 years was a long period of interest in the composition of the balance. It is not Trump's claim that we didn't get \"nothing\" in return that misses the purpose of the deal: to prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb. \"We have significant, transparent and intrusive restrictions on Iran's nuclear programme. Far from being \"nothing,\" this is the whole reason we imposed sanctions in the first place, and Richard Neviu, the economist at the Center for World Energy Policy of Columbia University, told us in 2016. \"The reasonable people may differ whether we get enough to ease the sanctions, but it was nothing.\" \"There is a long list (of the things we've got), so that even the Israeli intelligence community has concluded that, for the duration of the bargain, Iran will not have a nuclear weapon,\" said George Berkovich, an expert in nuclear strategy at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Under this transaction, Iran agreed to lose 97 per cent of its stock of enriched uranium and to abandon 14,000 of its 20,000 centrifuges, which are necessary for uranium enrichment. It also agreed to limit the production of plutonium (the other element that could be used in the manufacture of a bomb) and to dismantle its single plutonium reactor. In order to ensure Iran's fulfilment of the deal, the agreement also allowed international inspectors to carry out ongoing monitoring. What this means and whether it is sufficient is under discussion. Our Governor Trump said that under the 2015 nuclear deal, the United States \"maintained\" Iran $150 billion and $1.8 billion, and \"got nothing\" for any of that. The $150 billion - not a gift, but a de-freezing of Iran's assets - is the highest estimate we have seen, which has the least evidence to support it. The high estimates from the United States Treasury Department in 2015 were $56 billion, and external analysts believe that the number could be lower. The $1.8 billion is reasonably accurate. The official amount is $1.7 billion. As for \"nothing\" from the deal, while some people would disagree that the U.S. got enough, This is more than nothing. Only one of the three elements in the Trump statement is supported by the official record. We're assessing this mostly wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00224"}
