That means he got a cheesesteak from Geno\u2019s in Philly and, true to Western PA form, he went to get a Smiley Cookie (yes, that\u2019s the name of something, and it\u2019s trademarked) while he was outside Pittsburgh this week.\nAfter Trump left town,\u00a0a post appeared on his Facebook page:\u00a0\"Stopped by Smiley Cookie to pick up some great cookies for the family, along with Rudy [Giuliani].\"\nHowever, the popular chain of diners headquartered in Homestead outside Pittsburgh is actually not called Smiley Cookie, despite its most famous food offering. No, the chain is actually called \"Eat\u2019n Park.\" Sure, this isn\u2019t about foreign or domestic policy. But it\u2019s important to Pennsylvania, so we decided to check Trump\u2019s claim of swinging by a place called \"Smiley Cookie.\"\nThe GOP presidential nominee held a rally at Ambridge Area High School about 20 miles northwest of Pittsburgh Monday, his first since coming under fire following the release of audio from 2005 of Trump\u2019s using offensive language referring to women.\nLocal TV station WPXI reported\u00a0that after the rally had wrapped up, Trump and members of his campaign traveled to Moon Township, where they stopped at an Eat\u2019n Park. Trump and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a top ally of the presidential nominee, reportedly bought a dozen Smiley Cookies while there.\nAccording to Eat\u2019n Park\u2019s corporate website, the establishment was founded in 1949 \"as the first Pittsburgh-area drive-in with carhops.\" Today, it\u2019s more like just a diner, but it has more than 65 locations in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio.\nThe restaurants serve breakfast, lunch and dinner, but the most famous part is the bakery, where employees whip up pies, cakes and, of course, hand-frosted Smiley Cookies that are given to children who eat at the restaurant. They\u2019re also available for purchase.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEat\u2019n Park has been doling out the Smiley Cookies for the last 30 years, and the restaurant itself has become a western Pennsylvania institution of sorts, as it\u2019s one of the only 24-hour joints still around.\nSome on social media reacted harshly to Trump\u2019s mix-up, while others were more understanding. The Smiley Cookie\u00a0is\u00a0the most iconic part of Eat\u2019n Park.\nEat\u2019n Park Hospitality Group and the Trump campaign didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment Tuesday.\nOur ruling\nDonald Trump posted on Facebook that he \"Stopped by Smiley Cookie to pick up some great cookies for the family, along with Rudy.\" We\u2019ll leave deciding whether or not the cookies can be considered \"great\" to you.\nBut this place is not called Smiley Cookie. It\u2019s called Eat\u2019n Park. And it has been called that for 67 years. The mix-up\u2019s understandable, though, and Trump did purchase the Smiley Cookies in question. We rate the claim Mostly False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/55743655-7a4a-4186-84f8-2fe48eadaa6d", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04157"}
