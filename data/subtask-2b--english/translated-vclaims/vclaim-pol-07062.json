When Tammy Baldwin from De Weiss University said that college students graduated on average with $30,000 in student debt, Some reliable data indicate that the figure is accurate, but others indicate that it may be lower. And when Ron Johnson claimed from R-Wise that the rich were using student loans at the expense of middle-class families, our assessment was mostly wrong. He overestimated the problem on both sides. In the Governor's race, democratic rival Mary Burke said that debt relief for student loans was one of her priorities. Her claim that there are 41,000 people on the waiting list for financial aid for technical colleges and universities in Wisconsin has mostly won the right. The number wasn't quite fixed, but very solid. In the meantime, the Government of the Republic. Scott Walker has frozen his tuition fees at the University of Wisconsin instead of discussing university financial assistance. However, on October 27, 2014, the Liberal Great Wisconsin Committee, which published television spots criticizing Walker, issued another announcement: \"Scott Walker has offered a plan to help Wisconsin students refinance their student loans. Let's see. It turns out that the Wisconsin Grand Commission has no evidence that Walker opposed the state's proposal to help students refinance their student debts. Instead, the group claims that since Walker did not speak or take action in favour of the plan proposed by the Democrats, he opposed it. Walker had every chance to show his support for this legislative proposal. He specifically chose not to express support, and instead completely avoid the subject, \"The Executive Director of the group, Judge Rich, told us in an e-mail. On January 9, 2021, on Twitter, Sarah Goodlowski stated: \"Not all women lost jobs (in December's job report), most of them black and Latin women. \u2022 On 15 January 2021, the judge referred to legislation announced in October 2013 to establish a State authority to refinance student loans. Hearings of the Legislative Committee on the proposal were held in February 2014. However, no vote was taken by the Committee or the entire legislature at all, and the matter therefore never reached the Walker Bureau. The judge also noted that Walker rejected a request from the Democrats in April 2014 to hold a special session of the legislature. He noted, however, that the request not only addressed the proposal for refinancing but also covered a number of other draft laws. Finally, the judge cited a September 2014 news article in Green Bay Press-Gazette about the emergence of the Walker campaign. Walker did not specifically talk about student loan debt during the stopover, but he preferred to control education over government-supported financial aid, as the newspaper stated. Walker was quoted as saying: \"We know that it is not just about providing more financial assistance, but about providing a substantial price for one-world war education, which is initially low.\" However, none of the above shows opposition from the Governor to the refinancing proposal. We found another article in September 2014 in the Racine Journal Times. That article stated that Walker said that he was willing to consider measures such as the Refinancing Bill, but wondered whether the proposal was \"more than a policy\" because the Democrats did not issue it when they controlled the legislature and the Governor's office before his election in 2010. \"If it was a good idea, and I'm sure they had it four years ago when they controlled the Assembly, the Senate and the Governor,\" Walker was quoted as saying in response to questions from journalists. \"They did not just do so at that time, they presided over the state government, which experienced an average of 5.5 percent of annual increases in education.\" Walker certainly does not declare his support for the Refinancing Authority, but he does not express his opposition either. Our assessment of Wisconsin's grand committee says Walker offered a plan to help Wisconsin refinance their student loans. The group acknowledged that it had no evidence that Walker had opposed a democratic proposal for 2013 to establish an authority to refinance government student loans. Walker may not support the idea, but he did not fight it either - as claimed by the group. We're assessing the statement wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07062"}
