But we paused at another Martinez point: \"Banned texting while driving to improve safety for drivers, bicyclists and pedestrians.\"\n\nMartinez banned TWD in ATX?\n\nAustin\u2019s texting-while-driving ban, which took effect Jan. 1, 2010, has yielded about $31,800 in fine revenue for the city\u2019s general fund, according to Rebecca Stark, the city\u2019s municipal court director. She told us that 93 drivers in 2010 and 158 drivers in 2011 pleaded no contest or guilty or were found guilty of violating the ban. In 2010, 121 cases of ban violations were filed, she said. That figure nearly doubled to 222 in 2011.\n\nIn a telephone interview, Martinez, a former firefighter who won his first council term in 2006, told us that as a member of the city\u2019s public safety task force, he brought up the idea of banning texting while driving, initially to derision. He said he asked the Austin Police Department to research texting as a local traffic hazard and after years of community conversations, the seven-member City Council approved the ordinance.\n\nMartinez told us that he did not ban texting by his lonesome: \"Anything we do has to be ratified by the council. I did take a certain ownership and pride in this issue. I was the only council member to originally call for a ban on texting.\"\n\nAccording to Austin American-Statesman news articles, the ordinance barring texting while driving won unanimous council approval in October 2009. Violations are Class C misdemeanors subject to fines of up to $500.\n\nSome Statesman stories describe Martinez as the council\u2019s lead proponent of the ban.\n\nIn November 2008, the public safety task force voted to urge City Manager Marc Ott to develop a ban proposal. A Nov. 4, 2008, Statesman news article says \"Martinez, who is leading the effort, said he has received dozens of calls in recent months from motorists, pedestrians and bicyclists asking for such a law. \"It is something that needs to be done,\" the story quotes Martinez saying. \"When you see accidents that have happened or you hear about near-misses, it is just a step we can take to ensure the safety of our citizens.\"\"\n\nIn August 2009, the council directed city staffers to draft the proposed ban as an ordinance. An Aug. 28, 2009, Statesman news article refers to Martinez as the lead proponent of the ban.\n\nAccording to minutes of the Oct. 22, 2009, council meeting during which members adopted the ban, Martinez made the \"main motion\" for its approval. The motion was seconded by Mayor Lee Leffingwell.\n\nUpshot: Martinez\u2019s claim overshoots because, of course, he could not have imposed the ban by himself. The seven-person council acts on proposed ordinances.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 30, 2021 in a blog post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cTrump assassination foiled, Deep State in panic mode!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 February 4, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, Martinez was a leading advocate of the ban.
