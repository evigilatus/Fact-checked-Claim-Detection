He said people are entitled to religious exemptions when it would violate their faith to carry out the duties of their job.\nOn the show, Salcedo characterized the case as such:\n\"I shouldn\u2019t have to give up my career \u2014 make a choice, either give up your career or violate your religious beliefs,\" Salcedo said. \"The government shouldn\u2019t put me in that position.\"\nSaledo\u2019s description of Hensely\u2019s situation is inaccurate. No one is asking Hensley to violate her religious beliefs to keep her career: officiating marriages is an optional activity. A state commission\u2019s opinion on the matter suggested she could officiate all or no marriages, but not selectively choose one type.\nProtection of religious beliefs\nJustices of the peace handle low-level civil and criminal cases, including traffic and other Class C misdemeanor cases and civil cases involving up to $10,000.\nThey can also officiate marriages, but this is considered \"extra-judicial,\" an optional activity that earns them thousands per year in personal income.\nSo while there may be some financial incentive to do it, it is by no means required.\u00a0\nIn fact, some justices of the peace in Texas have chosen not to officiate any marriages in order to avoid the religious dilemma, including in McLennan County, where Hensley hails.\nThe commission decided to investigate Hensley based at least in part on a Waco Herald-Tribune article in which she was quoted about her decision to decline same-sex marriages and how she believed she was entitled to a religious accommodation.\nIt found that she had refused to perform same-sex marriages since 2016, instead only performing opposite-sex marriages and referring same-sex couples to other officiating JPs and clergy.\nThe state commission that sanctioned Hensley said her actions cast \"doubt on her capacity to act impartially to persons appearing before her as a judge due to the person\u2019s sexual orientation.\"\nNow, Hensley can appeal the sanction, start performing same-sex marriages or stop performing marriages altogether.\nHensley has argued that she is entitled to a \"religious exemption,\" but there is no law or legal precedent in Texas establishing such an exemption for a justice of the peace in this context.\nThis question varies by state, depending on whether the state\u2019s Supreme Court has taken up a case and established a precedent.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn separate interviews, Douglas Laycock and John Dzienkowski, law professors at the University of Texas, said they weren\u2019t aware of any such cases in Texas.\u00a0\nTwo legal opinions on the subject that have been issued by state agencies \u2014 a 2015 opinion from the attorney general\u2019s office and the Judicial Commission sanction \u2014 are nonbinding.\nIn a 2015 opinion filed after the U.S. Supreme Court case on same-sex marriage, Paxton supported people\u2019s right to assert a religious exemption under the First Amendment, though he noted that fines and litigation were possible.\nThe recent Judicial Commission opinion punished Henlsey for giving off the appearance of bias, seeming to indicate an exemption would not be possible.\nBut Laycock said neither document is legally binding.\n\"The basic answer is we don\u2019t know yet,\" Laycock said. \"This may well wind up in the courts.\"\nSome states, such as North Carolina, have passed laws on this subject, but Texas has not.\u00a0\nThe North Carolina law allows some officials, similar to a justice of the peace, to decline to administer any marriages if they have a \"sincerely held religious objection\" to same-sex marriage, but they may not be selective and only marry opposite-sex couples.\nOther positions have different requirements\nPeople in other government positions, like county clerks who issue marriage licenses, have less flexibility, as issuing marriage licenses can be part of their job description.\u00a0\nPerhaps most famously, Kim Davis, a clerk in Kentucky, refused to issue a license to a same-sex couple and, in a high-profile case, she was sued. When she refused to comply with the judge\u2019s order compelling her to follow the law, she was jailed for six days for being in contempt of court. Davis was later released after agreeing not to interfere with other clerks in the office issuing licenses.\nSome county clerks in Texas are allowing those officials who object to same-sex marriage to find another clerk within the office to issue a license in their place.\nBut if everyone else in the office also refuses, the office as a whole can\u2019t deny a couple the right to marry in defiance of the law, Laycock said.\nThat may explain why no religious exemption case has risen to the Supreme Court level in Texas, Laycock said. As long as the couple receives their license or has their marriage officiated, the damages they can claim in court are limited to emotional distress.\nThat someone in Hensley\u2019s position should not be forced to choose between their job and religious belief, as Salcedo commented, is \"not a settled rule of law yet; it\u2019s an opinion about what the law ought to be,\" Laycock said.\nOur ruling\nSalcedo said justices of the peace like Hensley are being asked to choose: \"give up your career or violate your religious beliefs.\"\nJustices of the peace are not required to officiate marriages and do so mainly for their own benefit, not as an integral duty of the job. Clerks, on occasion, may not have the luxury of that choice, but that is not what Salcedo called out in the statement. Plus, there hasn\u2019t been an authoritative ruling in Texas on either situation.\nWe rate this statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16693"}
