Matt Lundy says House GOP added extra tax breaks to sweeten sales pitch on prisons", "text": "Gov. John Kasich\u2019s wish to sell off six state prisons has become yet another partisan political hot potato in Columbus. Then again, what isn\u2019t during budget season.\n\nBut state Rep. Matt Lundy, an Elyria Democrat, kicked it up a notch with comments during a May 2 news conference called for the purpose of throwing cold water on the Republican governor\u2019s plan to sell off five adult prison facilities and one youth detention center.\n\nKasich has said the transaction could net Ohio a profit of $200 million.\n\nLundy disagrees. He argues that there still will be bonds and improvement debts to be serviced and that will cut into the profit.\n\nHe likened the proposal to an \"insane yard sale\" and questioned the logic of selling state assets during a down economic period when they may fetch low bids.\n\nHe also accused Republicans in control of the House of helping Kasich to lure buyers.\n\n\"The substitute budget now adds in tax breaks and tax deductions for those who buy these prisons,\" Lundy said. The House passed its version of the budget on May 5.\n\nPolitifact Ohio decided to take a closer look.\n\nThe House did propose a sales tax exemption, income tax deduction and commercial tax exclusion for any buyer that strikes a deal with Ohio to take over the prisons offered for sale. Lundy said such friendly trinkets will eat away at the state\u2019s expect profits on the deal.\n\nSo, why was it included? Kasich\u2019s proposal didn\u2019t offer the tax breaks but the House Republicans did.\n\nHouse Finance Chairman Ron Amstutz, a Wooster Republican, said the tax provisions were added to assure that the private buyer of the prisons would be treated like any other state entity since they will essentially be performing a state function by housing inmates.\n\n\"Typically state entities don\u2019t pay taxes on their functions and that is true of local governments, as well,\" Amstutz said. \"And I think the desire is to maintain that status in order to provide for services at the lowest cost that we can.\"\n\nIf the private entities were to pay these particular taxes, which go back to supporting the local communities where the facilities are located, then \"basically the state taxpayers would be subsidizing the local taxpayers at that point for a state function and typically we don\u2019t do that,\" Amstutz explained.\n\nState prisons spokesman Carlo LoParo noted, however, that any buyer of the state prisons would be expected to pay property taxes each year, which would net a huge amount of cash for the local governments where there facilities are located.\n\n\"That\u2019s pretty substantial,\" LoParo said. He added that the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections had closely monitored the House negotiations to make sure that a carve out for property taxes was not stuck in.\n\n\"We took pains to make sure there were no loopholes,\" he said. \"We fully expect them to pay property taxes to those communities where the prisons are located.\"\n\nThe impact for local governments could be substantial.\n\nFor example, there are two facilities offered for sale that are in Marion -- the North Central Correctional Institution that houses adults and the Marion Juvenile Correctional Facility, which is currently closed.\n\nCombined, the two properties are valued at $100 million, which would result in about $1.5 million annually in property tax collections for that small city. LoParo said that should be enough money help Marion\u2019s police force pick up criminal investigations at the two facilities, which would fall to the city and not state highway patrol, as is currently the case.\n\nSo where does Lundy land on the Truth-O-Meter.\n\nLundy is correct that the the substitute budget includes tax breaks and tax deductions for those who buy the prisons. There would be no sales tax on the purchase and there are other exclusions for income and commercial taxes.\n\nThe administration is demanding that local property taxes absolutely be paid, which could yield significant revenue to local governments and schools.\n\nAnd Lundy is correct that the tax breaks and deductions in the budget bill were added in by the House.\n\nOn the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Lundy\u2019s comment as True.\n\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13106"}
