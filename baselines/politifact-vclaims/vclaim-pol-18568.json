(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nWe reviewed Time covers from 2008, when Obama was elected, to date and found no cover matching the image in the video.\u00a0\nThe video goes on to share more fake images of the president among unfounded claims.\u00a0\nAbout 17 seconds into the video, one photo has been edited to show Obama wearing a turban while standing next to Osama bin Laden. In the original image, released by Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign in February 2008, Obama was dressed as a Somali elder by Sheikh Mahmed Hassan, who is standing next to Obama during his visit to northeastern Kenya.\u00a0\nThe next image in the video shows former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Clinton and Obama all posing separately with bin Laden. We\u2019ve already fact-checked those photos \u2014 they\u2019re fake.\u00a0\nAbout 45 seconds into the video, an image of Obama and Clinton appears with this text: \"They paid a foreign government to falsify information, than lied to the courts to spy and overthrow Trump. Democrats lied and impeached Trump to hide their crimes.\"\u00a0\nThis touches on other claims we\u2019ve already checked.\u00a0\nAfter Trump won the Republican nomination, the Democratic National Committee hired an opposition firm called Fusion GPS to collect information on him. Fusion GPS then hired former British spy Christopher Steele to produce memos on Trump\u2019s ties to Russia. He wrote a dossier that included salacious but unverified claims about Trump.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn September 2019, House Democrats launched a formal impeachment inquiry on grounds that Trump illegally used his position as president to solicit help from a foreign government to damage his political opponent. We have a timeline of the impeachment proceedings, from 2013 through late 2019, here.\u00a0\nAbout a minute and 11 seconds into the video, a photo of Obama appears with the names \"Jean Paul Ludwig\" and \"Barry Soetoro\" and a Social Security number. These refer to inaccurate claims that Obama\u2019s real name is Barry Soetoro and that Obama has illegally been using the Social Security number of a dead man, Ludwig.\u00a0\nThe video also uses imagery and slogans associated with the wide-ranging QAanon conspiracy, which asserts without evidence that Trump is fighting against a deep-state cabal of pedophiles seeking to overthrow the president. About a minute and 45 seconds in, it claims that Obama helped \"plan a coup\" and that he should \"pay the price\" for treason.\u00a0\nAfter that, another fake image appears, showing Obama kissing David Cameron, Britain\u2019s former prime minister.\u00a0\nLater in the video, a photo of former presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Obama appears and perpetuates the conspiracy theory that mass shootings in the United States are orchestrated by the government to achieve its policy agenda.\u00a0\n\"Trump is sending us all to Gitmo for life,\" Clinton appears to be saying in the image.\u00a0\n\"Let\u2019s plan another mass shooting,\" Bush says.\u00a0\n\"We can\u2019t,\" Obama responds, \"all the restaurants and theaters are closed.\"\u00a0\nToward the end of the video, yet another doctored image appears. Snopes checked this one \u2014 it appears to show Russian President Vladimir Putin pulling Obama\u2019s tie, but that didn\u2019t happen.\u00a0\nWe rate these images False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18568"}
