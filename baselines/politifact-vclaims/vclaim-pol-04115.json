Marco Rubio said Democrat U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy is in \"rare company\" by fully trusting Hillary Clinton.\nThe U.S. Senate candidates relentlessly attacked the other\u2019s presidential party nominee at the U.S. Senate debate Oct. 17 in Orlando. After Murphy explained to the audience why he supports Clinton, Rubio fired back with an unsubstantiated claim about U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, the Democratic vice presidential nominee.\n\"If Congressman Murphy trusts Hillary Clinton 100 percent, he\u2019s in rare company, because not even Tim Kaine is willing to say that,\" Rubio said, \"and he\u2019s her running mate.\"\nHis line got a few laughs, but a quick search of articles and transcripts refutes his point.\n\u2018I trust Hillary Clinton with our son\u2019s life\u2019\nKaine accepted his party\u2019s nomination to be vice president on July 27 during the Democratic National Convention, less than a week after Clinton announced him as her choice. In his speech, the Virginia senator and former Virginia governor vouched for Clinton\u2019s character and urged voters to trust her.\n\"Hey, last week, last week in Cleveland we heard a lot about trust,\" Kaine said, referring to the Republican National Convention. \"So let\u2019s talk about trust. Let\u2019s talk about trust. I want to tell you why I trust Hillary Clinton.\"\nKaine pointed to Clinton\u2019s longtime work helping kids and families through her work on the Children\u2019s Defense Fund, and added, \"And on a personal level, as (Nat) is serving our nation abroad, I trust Hillary Clinton with our son\u2019s life.\"\nKaine reiterated his trust more recently during the first question of the vice presidential debate on Oct. 7 about why he would be qualified to fill the position of president if need be.\n\"We trust Hillary Clinton, my wife and I, and we trust her with the most important thing in our life,\" Kaine said. \"We have a son deployed overseas in the Marine Corps right now. We trust Hillary Clinton as president and commander in chief, but the thought of Donald Trump as commander in chief scares us to death.\"\nWith all of this talk about trust, we wondered what Rubio was talking about. His campaign sent PolitiFact Florida a news release exploring Kaine\u2019s comments regarding Clinton\u2019s trustworthiness, pointing to Kaine\u2019s interview ABC\u2019s The View in October.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\n stated on January 23, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBiden invested the entire family fortune in Ukraine gas and oil. Then shuts down Keystone pipeline. Starting to get the picture.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"During an appearance on The View, Tim Kaine would not say that Hillary Clinton is trustworthy when asked about \u2018voters that have doubted her on the trust issues,\u2019 reads the release.\nWatch the clip for yourself. After we did, we found the press release was misleading \u2014 and Rubio\u2019s interpretation was even more over the top.\n\nKaine doesn\u2019t say he trusts Clinton, but he\u2019s never explicitly asked if he does. He is probed about the internal emails released by Wikileaks, and how findings that Clinton might have received debate questions ahead of time affect the campaign, especially since Clinton has struggled with trust among voters.\n\"And we've seen that one of the issues that she's struggled with is this issue of trust. Does this support that?\" The View co-host Jedediah Bila asked Kaine. \"Or what do you say to voters that have doubted her on the trust issues and now see these things coming through via Wikileaks?\"\nKaine told the audience that the Russian government was behind the Wikileaks, adding that \"you can't automatically assume that everything in all of these documents are even real.\" He then went on to defend Clinton\u2019s character, referencing her fight for health insurance for low-income children.\n\"Hillary Clinton has a passion from the time she was a kid in a Methodist youth group in the suburbs of Chicago,\" Kaine said. \"Under the influence of this great guy named Don Jones, her passion has been empowering families and kids.\"\nOur ruling\nRubio said that \"not even Tim Kaine\" is willing to say that he trusts Hillary Clinton.\nThis is wrong. Kaine has vocalized his trust of Clinton on multiple occasions, and there is no evidence suggesting Kaine doesn\u2019t feel this way.\nRubio\u2019s statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.
