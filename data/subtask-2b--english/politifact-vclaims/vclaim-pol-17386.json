Biden Says So. But Numbers Say No.", "text": "During the Feb. 7 Democratic presidential debate, former Vice President Joe Biden once again questioned the price tag of \"Medicare for All,\" the single-payer health care proposal championed by one of his key rivals, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.\nBiden argued that the plan was fiscally irresponsible and would require raising middle-class taxes. Specifically, he claimed, the plan \"would cost more than the entire federal budget that we spend now.\"\nMedicare for All\u2019s price \u2014 and whether it\u2019s worth it \u2015 is a subject of fierce discussion among Democratic presidential candidates. But we had never heard this figure before. It caught our attention, so we decided to dig in.\nBiden\u2019s campaign directed us to the 2018 federal budget, which totaled $4.1 trillion. It compared that amount to the estimated cost of Sanders\u2019 single-payer proposal: between $30 trillion and $40 trillion over a decade. The math, they said, shows Medicare for All would cost more than the national budget.\nBut it turns out, based on the numbers and interviews with independent experts, Biden\u2019s comparison of Medicare for All\u2019s price to total federal spending misses the mark because the calculation is flawed.\nThe numbers\nSanders has said publicly that economists estimate Medicare for All would cost somewhere between $30 trillion and $40 trillion over 10 years. Research by the nonpartisan Urban Institute, a Washington D.C. think tank, puts the figure in the $32 trillion to $34 trillion range.\nWe pointed out to Biden\u2019s campaign that comparing 10-year spending estimates to one-year budgets is like comparing apples to oranges. The campaign suggested that if you take 10 times the current federal budget, you get a figure smaller than the estimated cost of Medicare for All over that 10-year window.\nThat calculation would lead you to multiply $4.1 trillion by 10 to get $41.1 trillion. That result is close to the high mark Sanders set for his program\u2019s cost but well above the $34 trillion that Urban researchers projected.\nStill, that\u2019s not the correct way to formulate a comparison, experts say. \"That\u2019s not good math,\" said Marc Goldwein, the senior vice president and senior policy director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. \"That\u2019s taking a 2018 number, and multiplying it by 10, whereas the $34 trillion is a 10-year number that assumes a lot of growth.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSteve Scalise\n\n\nstated on February 2, 2021 in an interview on Fox News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNow (Biden) is saying that people who came here illegally can jump ahead of other Americans who have been waiting to get the vaccine.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Victoria Knight \u2022 February 8, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat you would need to do is add up the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s projected budget outlays from 2020 to 2029, and compare the sum to the Medicare for All spending figure.\nSo we spoke to Linda Blumberg, an institute fellow at Urban\u2019s Health Policy Center, who arrived at the $34 trillion estimate. She ran the CBO\u2019s numbers: The next 10 years of on-budget outlay, the government office projects, add up to $44.8 trillion.\nTo be clear, $34 trillion (34 followed by 12 zeros) is no small sum. It accounts for about 75% of that nearly $45 trillion budget estimate and would represent a bigger single increase to the federal budget than we\u2019ve ever experienced, Blumberg said.\nThat raises one point on which Biden may have some ground. Goldwein argued that you would indeed need significant tax increases to finance the Sanders proposal.\nBut its price tag still would be less than the projected budget.\n\"If he said [Medicare for All] was as big as the current federal budget, that would be incorrect,\" Blumberg said.\nGoldwein looked at the numbers another way: Including interest, he found, the federal budget would consume about $55 trillion between now and 2030. Again, that\u2019s more than what Medicare for All would cost during the same period.\nBig picture: No matter how you slice Biden\u2019s math, his numbers are off.\n\"If what he said was Medicare for All will cost as much as the entire rest of the budget, that would be fair,\" Goldwein said. But that\u2019s not the same thing.\nOur ruling\nBiden argued that Medicare for All \"would cost more than the entire federal budget that we spend now.\"\nThis relies on faulty math. Medicare for All would certainly represent a substantial increase to the federal budget. But it would neither match nor dwarf current federal spending overall.
