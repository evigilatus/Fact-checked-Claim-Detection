Rick Scott and the Republican Party of Florida decided to fight back with their own job statistics.\n\"Florida has experienced positive job growth for 39 consecutive months,\" the Republican Party of Florida posted on Facebook this month.\nThe claim seemed odd to us, since 39 months would include part of former Gov. Charlie Crist\u2019s term. We wanted to dig further.\nFlorida job statistics currently are available through October 2013, meaning Scott has been in office for 34 months where figures are available. In that time, Florida has gained jobs in 29 months and lost jobs in five months -- including as recently as May.\nThat means Florida has added jobs for five consecutive months, according to federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, not 39.\nCase closed?\nNot entirely.\nThe state Republican Party told us it didn\u2019t mean \"consecutive\" as in month after month. Instead, Republicans said they were comparing each month to the same month the previous year -- so October 2012 vs. October 2013, etc.\nBy that measure, Florida has had 39 months of positive job growth.\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor statistics, the last month that saw a decline in the total number of people employed compared to the same month the previous year was July 2010.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Godlewski\n\n\nstated on January 9, 2021 in Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all women that lost jobs (in the December jobs report), it was mostly Black and Latina women. In fact, white women gained employment.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Nusaiba Mizan \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe turned to economists to see what they thought of the GOP\u2019s wording and approach.\nThey said the GOP was misleading in its wording but that one measure of job growth isn\u2019t necessarily better than the other.\nChris Lafakis, a senior economist at Moody\u2019s and Bill Seyfried, an economist at Rollins College in Florida, told us it can be more useful to look at trends over a few months in a row.\n\"For example, In March and April of 2013, the Florida economy added about 25,000 and 19,000 jobs, respectively,\" Seyfried said. \"There were about 5,000 fewer jobs in May but then about 36,000 jobs added over the next two months. As an economist, I view May as the outlier given solid employment gains in the two months before and two months afterwards. I wouldn\u2019t extend that to 12 months, but normally would focus on the three-month average (as opposed to just one month at a time).\"\nGary Burtless, an economist at Brookings, said that most readers would have misinterpreted the Republican Party\u2019s statement to refer to one month followed by the next month. \"Employment has generally increased over the past 39 months,\" he said. But \"it simply hasn't increased for 39 consecutive months.\"\nRetired University of Florida economics professor David Denslow agreed.\nThe GOP \"should have said, Florida has experienced positive year-over-year job growth for 39 consecutive months,\u2019 \" Denslow said.\nOur ruling\nThe Republican Party of Florida said \"Florida has experienced positive job growth for 39 consecutive months.\"\nEconomists say the state GOP is guilty of sloppy wording here. Florida has not experienced 39 consecutive months of job growth. The correct figure is five. But there is a sliver of truth if you look at the claim through the GOP\u2019s eyes. Florida has seen year-over-year job growth for 39 consecutive months, which while not what Republicans said, is an equally notable metric.\nWords matter. We rate this claim Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08478"}
