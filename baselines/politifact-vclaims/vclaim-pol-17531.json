The Philadelphia Inquirer reported on the Dec. 10 event and published a video on its website showing interviews with supporters and shots of the crowd on a rainy day.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not the scene that appears in this Dec. 12 Facebook post, which shows an image of a massive crowd in a stadium.\u00a0\n\"No, this is not Live Aid,\" text over the image reads. \"This is a Trump rally in downtown Philly yesterday. Why isn\u2019t the media showing this??\"\nBecause it is a photo of Live Aid, the July 13, 1985, concert held at Wembley Stadium in London.\u00a0\u00a0\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

A photo by Daily Mirror photographer Brendon Monks appears to be the image that has been doctored and shared in the Facebook post. In the manipulated version, a Trump sign appears in lieu of a white tent near the stage and two more Trump signs appear where the Live Aid logo appears on the stage.\u00a0\nBut, as one commenter noted, the Photoshop job still includes a \"Feed the world\" banner on the concert stage.\u00a0\nBack in May, we fact-checked a similar Facebook post that used a photo from the 1969 Woodstock festival and proclaimed: \"Nope it\u2019s not Woodstock. It\u2019s the Trump Rally yesterday in PA!!\"\nWe rated that Pants on Fire.\u00a0\nThis Facebook post that appropriates earns the same distinction. Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17531"}
