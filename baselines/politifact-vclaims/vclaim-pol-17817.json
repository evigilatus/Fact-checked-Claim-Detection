Jim Justice warned that the state\u2019s elderly population would be vulnerable if the virus\u2019 spread was not contained.\u00a0\n\"West Virginia, you are the oldest state,\" Justice said at a July 27 press briefing, at the 9:22 minute mark. \"You are the most chronically ill state. You have the most lung problems of any state. You are sitting right with all the border states\u2013\u2013all the way around you\u2013\u2013you are sitting within a rock\u2019s throw of two-thirds of the population of the whole country. You could explode in the most negative way that you could ever fathom.\"\nSome of these metrics were too nebulous to measure, but we decided to take a closer look at age. Does West Virginia have the highest population of elderly residents in the country?\nWe found that it doesn\u2019t, but that it does rank near the top.\nThere are at least two obvious ways to analyze how old a state\u2019s population is.\nOne of those is the percentage of the population made up by people 65 or older. According to 2019 Census Bureau data, 20.5% of West Virginia\u2019s population is made up of people at least 65 years old. That ranks West Virginia the third highest of any state, behind Maine and Florida. (Puerto Rico, which is not a state, would rank higher than any of these three states.)\nAnother way to measure a state\u2019s age is to take the median age of the population.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoe Manchin\n\n\nstated on September 16, 2018 in remarks at a teachers' rally\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWest Virginia has \"more veterans per capita\" than any state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Emily Martin \u2022 October 11, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCensus data for 2018 shows that West Virginia\u2019s median age was 42.7 years. That ranked it fourth in the country. Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont all had higher median ages, as did Puerto Rico.\nJustice would have been correct two decades ago. The 2000 Census found that West Virginia did rank first in the country in median age, edging out Pennsylvania.\nJustice did not respond to an inquiry for this article.\nOur ruling\u00a0\nJustice said that West Virginia is the oldest state in the nation.\nJustice has a point that West Virginia has an older population than many states, and as recently as two decades ago it did rank No. 1.\nHowever, today, it\u2019s not the oldest, by two different measures. West Virginia has the third-highest population of 65-and-over residents and the fourth-oldest median age of any state. So Justice wasn\u2019t correct to say that his state is the nation\u2019s oldest, but it does rank near the top.\nWe rate the statement Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17817"}
