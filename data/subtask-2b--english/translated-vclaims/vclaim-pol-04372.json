In order to defend Donald Trump &apos; s immigration policies, Vice-President Mike Pines launched an attack on Hillary Clinton &apos; s policies. On NBC to meet with the press, Director Chuck Todd Pines asked about Trump's policies to prevent Muslims from entering the United States. In recent weeks, Trump has said that he will prevent Muslims from countries engaged in terrorist activities. When Todd put pressure on Pines about what those countries are, Pines changed the subject to the policy of Clinton Syria. \"Well, Hillary Clinton wants to increase Syrian refugees to this country by 550 percent,\" said Penny. \"Donald Trump and I believe we should suspend the Syrian refugee programme.\" Penny added that its preferred policy was to work with Arab countries to establish safe areas closer to Syria. We wanted to look at Penny's claim that Clinton's policy is increasing by 550 percent. This number is accurate now. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is the international agency that tracks and promotes the resettlement of refugees around the world. The current number of persons fleeing the civil war in Syria, which began in 2011, is 4.8 million. Many of these 4.8 million refugees are in neighbouring countries such as Turkey, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon. In view of the overcrowding and the large number of refugees in general, the United Nations has called on other countries around the world to accept more Syrians for resettlement. President Barack Obama agreed on behalf of the United States to admit 10,000 refugees for the 2016 fiscal year. The figure was reached on 29 August 2016, and the United Nations commended the teacher in a press release. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 On 11 January 2021, \"We thank the communities in the United States that have kept their doors open, as well as our civil society partners for their tireless humanitarian efforts. Chile Petermann, UNHCR's regional representative in the United States, said that much remained to be done for Syrian refugees and for the global crisis, which had seen more people fleeing persecution than ever before. The Agency stated that some 478,000 Syrians needed resettlement, and that Syrians accounted for about 40 per cent of all refugees around the world who needed resettlement. In September 2015, Clinton described the figure of US$ 10,000 as a good start, but urged an increase to US$ 65,000. Clinton then said that the United States must \"really look forward to emphasizing some of the most vulnerable, many oppressed religious minorities, including Christians, and some who have been subjected to brutality, such as Yazidi women.\" This figure of 65,000 is a 550 percent increase from the 10,000 that Obama supported. However, it is important to note that these figures apply to fiscal year 2016, which expires by 1 October 2016. Clinton did not discuss the figures for the next fiscal year. Thus, 55% of the number may soon be out of date. It should also be noted that there is a process of screening of refugees. The United Nations will identify and examine refugees before transferring them to a country for resettlement. United States security agencies, such as the Department of Homeland Security, then conduct multiple security inspections. The Governor, Benes, made a real distinction in politics between Republican and Democrat presidential candidates when he said that Clinton \"wanted to increase Syrian refugees to the country by 550 per cent.\" Trump is opposed to the settlement of refugees, while Clinton is in favour of it, and more than Obama's current policy. Clinton supported allowing 65,000 refugees when Obama supported 10,000. \u2219 (refugees are examined). This represents an increase of 550 per cent. The United Nations has determined that some 478,000 Syrian refugees need resettlement. The statement is accurate and we appreciate it correctly. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f5c92c56-bd8d-4a39-b2c5-58a7fed58505", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04372"}
