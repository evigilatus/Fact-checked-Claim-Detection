Jeb Bush criticized the economic performance of President Barack Obama.\n\"Six years after the recession ended, median incomes are down, households are, on average, poorer, and millions of people have given up looking for work altogether,\" Bush told the Detroit Economic Club on Feb. 4, 2015.\nWe\u2019ve already fact checked a similar claim about median incomes being down ( we rated it True), but we wondered whether Bush is correct that \"millions of people have given up looking for work altogether.\"\nWhen we checked with Bush\u2019s staff, they pointed us to two Bureau of Labor Statistics data points -- persons who are \"marginally attached to the labor force\" and \"discouraged workers.\"\nThese two measurements are similar, but slightly different.\n\"Marginally attached workers\" are those who \"want and are available for work, and who have looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months,\" but were not counted as unemployed because they had not searched for work in the four weeks prior to being interviewed by federal survey takers.\nThe \"discouraged workers\" category is a subset of marginally attached workers, but they have specifically told survey-takers that they aren\u2019t looking for work because they\u2019re discouraged -- specifically, that they \"believe there are no jobs available or there are none for which they would qualify.\"\nIn December 2014, there were 2.26 million marginally attached workers, of which 740,000 were considered discouraged workers. So if you use the definition for \"marginally attached workers,\" then Bush is right that \"millions of people have given up looking for work altogether.\" If you use the more specific \"discouraged workers\" definition, the number doesn\u2019t reach into the \"millions.\"\nWe can see an argument for preferring the discouraged workers figures. The four-week period without searching for a job certainly suggests that a person has \"given up\" (as Bush put it) but it\u2019s not proof positive. The criteria for discouraged workers is somewhat stronger for the purposes of checking Bush\u2019s claim, because survey takers have confirmed that workers are indeed \"discouraged.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

But despite some uncertainty over the definitions and the scope of the data, economists told PolitiFact that Bush is on reasonably safe ground in making this claim.\nThe statement is accurate but needs clarification, so we rate it Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06756"}
