We recently checked a similar claim by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., who said that Obama policies would lead to a top rate of 44.8 percent. (Ryan\u2019s claim -- which earned a rating of Mostly True -- used less expansive parameters than Moore's did.)\n\nAfter a reader suggested that we look at the column, we zeroed in on Moore\u2019s claim about comparative international taxes.\n\nWe should start off by noting that most comparisons like these are not made with every nation in the world but rather with countries that belong to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD, a group of nearly three-dozen large, industrialized democracies. This makes it a fairer comparison.\n\nBecause Moore was writing in the rest of the column about marginal personal income tax rates, we first turned to international comparisons of those rates for the OECD nations. We looked at data for 1988 -- Reagan\u2019s last year in office, and a year when top U.S. marginal tax rates reached a new low -- as well as 2010.\n\nFor 1988, the highest marginal tax rate for U.S. taxpayers was 28 percent. Of the 20 countries in the OECD comparison, only one had a lower rate -- Switzerland, at 11.5 percent.\n\nSo using this statistic, Moore is correct.\n\nHowever, top marginal tax rates are an imperfect statistic for this kind of comparison. Perhaps the most important problem is that they only take into account national taxes. Some OECD nations levy relatively light taxes at the national level but heavy taxes at the state and local level. This makes international comparisons using only the national statistic incomplete.\n\nSo we turned to another yardstick -- tax revenues as a percentage of gross domestic product. This measure shows how big the total tax burden is compared with a nation\u2019s economy. It incorporates national, state and local taxes of all types, rather than just income taxes.\n\nOECD statistics are available for 1985, in a study of 26 nations. In the U.S., total tax revenue accounted for 25.6 percent of GDP. Only six nations had a lower percentage -- Mexico, Korea, Greece, Portugal, Switzerland and Turkey -- and several of those were not among the top ranks of industrialized nations in 1985.\n\nSo here too, Moore\u2019s has solid backing for his claim that in the 1980s \"the U.S. was nearly the lowest-taxed nation in the world.\"\n\nBut what about today? Here, the backing is less solid.\n\nLooking strictly at top marginal tax rates, the U.S. rate of 35 percent was solidly in the middle of the pack -- tied for 18th among the 34 nations studied.\n\nMoore\u2019s claim doesn\u2019t hold up any better if you use taxes as a percentage of GDP.\n\nIn 2006 -- the most recent year for which an OECD comparison is available -- taxes accounted for 28 percent of U.S. GDP, up modestly from what it was in 1985. All told, 25 nations had a higher percentage than the U.S., while just four -- Mexico, Japan, Korea and Turkey -- had a lower percentage.\n\nThat hardly makes the U.S. \"nearly the highest\" taxed nation in the world. In fact, in order to rank in the top five nations on the 2006 list, the U.S. would have needed taxes to account for 43 percent of GDP -- about one and a half times their actual share.\n\nWhen we asked Moore if there was any data we were missing that would prove his point about the U.S. tax burden today, he said, \"today our corporate tax rate is highest and our personal income tax with the Obama proposals (included) would be well above average.\"\n\nHe\u2019s basically correct that our corporate tax rate is the world\u2019s highest -- we\u2019ve ruled that claim Mostly True in the past, although for many companies, loopholes and other tax rules bring down the rate they actually pay. Even so, nowhere in the column does Moore bring up corporate or business taxes, so we don\u2019t think that\u2019s strong support for his claim.\n\nAs for potential tax increases under Obama, those are speculative. Because of that, we don\u2019t see them as justification for stating that \"a quarter century later we're nearly the highest\" in taxation. Moore would have been on safer ground if he\u2019d written, \"If the increases I\u2019ve outlined here are enacted, we might end up with some of the highest tax rates in the world.\" But even this would be speculative, since we wouldn\u2019t know what other countries\u2019 tax rates will be if and when the U.S. hikes Moore opposes are enacted.\n\nWe have no quarrel with Moore\u2019s characterization of the late 1980s as a period when U.S. taxes were low compared with its rivals. It clearly was. But Moore's main point, that taxes have gone up significantly since the late 1980s, is a stretch. To the contrary, we find convincing evidence that the U.S. today remains a relatively low-tax nation compared to its industrialized competitors. U.S. tax rates might go up over the next few years, but that's speculation, not established facts. On balance, we rate Moore's comment Barely True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H.
