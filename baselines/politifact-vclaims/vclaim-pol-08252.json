States are free to set their own minimum wage rates, as long as they don\u2019t go \u00a0below the federal level. Last year, the General Assembly increased Rhode Island\u2019s minimum wage to $8 an hour, effective Jan. 1, 2014, and there are proposals to increase it further.\nStenhouse argues that the economic effects of raising the minimum wage are exaggerated by those who want to increase it. Most workers who support a family are already getting more than the minimum wage, he says, while those earning the minimum wage are usually young people supplementing an already above-the-minimum combined family income.\nOn Jan. 27, in a news release, Stenhouse quantified that claim. Of Rhode Islanders who are earning minimum wage, he said, \"only 14 percent serve as sole income earner for their family.\"\nWhen we asked Stenhouse about his statement, he said the source of the data was the Employment Policies Institute, a \u00a0business-backed, Washington, D.C.-based organization that produces research critical of state and federal minimum wages.\nThe employment institute prepared the research for the Rhode Center for Freedom and Prosperity last spring, when the General Assembly was considering raising the minimum wage to $8.25, so that was the figure used in the study. \u00a0The legislature wound up approving an $8-an-hour minimum wage.\nThe report is posted on the Center for Freedom and Prosperity\u2019s website, rifreedom.org, with a pie chart that illustrates its findings.\nMichael Saltsman, research director of the Employment Policies Institute, told us that its analysis was derived from a regular monthly survey conducted by the Census Bureau for the Bureau of Labor Statistics in which people are asked about their incomes and family status, among other things.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe institute found that, of Rhode Islanders earning less than $8.25-an-hour, 8 percent were single parents and 6 percent were married and the sole family earner.\nStenhouse said he added those together to get his 14 percent. He said he picked those two categories specifically, because he was focusing on families getting by on minimum wage.\nWe weren\u2019t able to recreate Saltsman\u2019s results, but other groups that have used the same data have ended up with similar findings.\nHeidi Shierholz is an economist with the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research group, based in Washington, D.C., that advocates increasing the minimum wage. She said the numbers Stenhouse used didn\u2019t seem out of line, but she added he was carving a narrow demographic slice from the total population affected by minimum wage increases.\nBut, as Stenhouse points out, he specifically limited his statement to families, not the broader category of households. \u00a0 \u00a0\nOur ruling\nMichael Stenhouse says only 14 percent of Rhode Islanders earning minimum wage or less are the sole earners for their families.\nStenhouse was citing figures from an established research group that another research group, with an opposite political philosophy, found to be credible.\nThe study he cited was based on an $8.25 wage, rather than Rhode Island\u2019s $8 rate. But that\u2019s not enough to make a big difference. We rule his claim True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08252"}
