One tit-for-tat war has broken out in North Carolina, where the Senate Majority PAC, a pro-Democratic group, has publicized two-year-old dirt from the office of Thom Tillis, the state\u2019s House Speaker and leading contender for the GOP Senate nomination.\nThe Senate Majority PAC, which supports Democratic incumbent Kay Hagan, released an ad on April 15 reminding viewers of how two Tillis staffers -- one of whom he shared an apartment with -- got caught having affairs with lobbyists just days apart.\n\"Thom Tillis\u2019 reaction?\" the narrator said. \"He claimed he was surprised by his roommate\u2019s affair, but then rewarded both aides with taxpayer-paid bonuses.\"\nThe ad also specified that the staffers -- Charles Thomas and Amy Hobbs -- resigned. Tillis\u2019 Democratic opponent, incumbent Sen. Kay Hagan, released a similar radio ad.\nTwo days later, Tillis\u2019 campaign offered a decidedly different take.\n\"Seen those ads attacking Thom Tillis?\" the narrator said. \"They\u2019re false. Tillis fired the staffers.\"\nWho\u2019s right here? PolitiFact concludes that the Senate Majority PAC\u2019s description of the situation -- not Tillis\u2019 -- is closer to the truth.\nWhat happened in 2012\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe News & Observer, a newspaper based in Raleigh, N.C., reported that Charles Thomas, Tillis\u2019 chief of staff and roommate, resigned in April 2012 after his affair with a lobbyist was caught on video. Less than one week later, policy analyst Amy Hobbs resigned after an affair of her own was exposed, the paper reported.\nTillis then offered the two former staffers a payment of one month\u2019s salary -- $12,500 for Thomas and $6,833.33 for Hobbs. The listed purpose was \"payment in lieu of notice,\" a term he took from Wikipedia that referred to a British policy. Under North Carolina law, Tillis wasn\u2019t obligated to pay either staffer a month\u2019s salary upon resignation.\nIn defending his decision to pay staffers, Tillis said, \"I stand by my decision to accept their resignation while recognizing the difficult transition period they are now entering.\"\nIn other words, Tillis at the time did not claim that he had fired the staffers -- only accepted their resignations. This supports the pro-Democratic ad, and clashes with what Tillis\u2019 2014 ad claims.\nIndeed, after our colleagues at FactCheck.org and the Washington Post Fact Checker expressed skepticism about Tillis\u2019 ad, his office now appears to be backing off the term \"fired.\"\n\"Speaker Tillis initiated the action that resulted in the termination of employment. He asked for their resignations,\" Tillis spokesman Jordan Shaw told PolitiFact.\nThat\u2019s closer to Tillis\u2019 initial phrasing, that he \"accepted\" the resignations, but it\u2019s still not the same thing as \"fired.\" And in any case, Tillis\u2019 response ad was not aired with the \"forced resignations\" terminology that Tillis\u2019 office began using after the fact.\nOur ruling\nTillis\u2019 ad called a pro-Democratic ad \"false\" for saying that he allowed two disgraced staffers in 2012 to \"resign.\" But the news coverage at the time painted a different picture -- he accepted their resignations. This generally supports the Democratic ad\u2019s description, so we rate Tillis\u2019 claim Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07942"}
