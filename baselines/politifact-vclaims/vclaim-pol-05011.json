Michael Roberson, attacking his alleged poor grades from the NRA.\nThe ads implied that Tarkanian has a poor record on Second Amendment issues, with one claiming that he is \"playing games with our gun rights.\"\n\nOnly a handful of Nevada lawmakers have been the recipient of NRA F marks. We wanted to know if Tarkanian really received a failing grade, and if so, why.\nFailing grade\nNRA grades and endorsements are made by lobbyists and analysts who follow state and federal firearm issues, and are generally only supposed to represent a snapshot in time.\n\"Candidate ratings for previous election cycles were compiled in the year of the election and may no longer accurately represent a candidate\u2019s or elected official\u2019s position or rating,\" the NRA\u2019s website says. (The NRA did not return our requests for comment on this fact-check.)\nTarkanian\u2019s F grade came a decade ago, during his Tarkanian\u2019s unsuccessful bid for Nevada secretary of state.\nBut isn\u2019t such a simple snapshot of his position on guns.\nDuring that 2006 race, the pro-gun control Brady Campaign for Gun Violence released a recorded robo-call supporting his candidacy.\nTarkanian told PolitiFact that he doesn\u2019t dispute the grade, but he never solicited the endorsement.\n\"I didn\u2019t know about it, and I didn\u2019t ask for it,\" he said. \"I have never in my life spoken to the Brady organization.\"\nThe timeline on the grade is slightly murky. Tarkanian says he wasn\u2019t involved, and the NRA\u2019s former lobbyist covering Nevada, Carrie Herbertson, passed away in 2014.\nBut former Brady Campaign president Paul Helmke said someone from the Tarkanian campaign solicited the endorsement, because the group doesn\u2019t typically involve itself in down-ballot races.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRobert Uithoven\n\n\nstated on June 6, 2016 in on an episode of Nevada NewsMakers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If Question 1 were to pass here in Nevada, we would have more restrictive gun laws here in Nevada dealing with the transfer of firearms than they do in California.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Riley Snyder \u2022 June 22, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There\u2019s no way we would have been involved in (the) secretary of state race in Nevada unless somebody from the campaign got involved,\" he said.\nDan Burdish, who served as an unpaid adviser to Tarkanian in 2006, said his memory was fuzzy but he believed the failing grade was due to confusion over some of the topics on the questionnaire.\n\"It just got screwed up,\" he said.\nBurdish said Tarkanian\u2019s mother, Las Vegas City Councilwoman Lois Tarkanian, contacted the Brady Campaign about endorsing him in the secretary of state race against eventual winner Ross Miller, who got an A from the NRA in 2006.\nLois Tarkanian didn\u2019t return multiple calls seeking comment.\nSecond Amendment issues didn\u2019t appear to play a major role in the race, as a cached version of Tarkanian\u2019s 2006 campaign website doesn\u2019t mention firearms and a pre-election preview in the Las Vegas Sun doesn\u2019t mention guns.\nThe F rating resurfaced during Tarkanian\u2019s 2010 run for U.S. Senate, when his then-primary\u00a0opponent Sue Lowden tried to revive it as a campaign issue.\nTarkanian campaign manager James Fisfis told the Las Vegas Review-Journal in 2009 that earlier poor grades were the result of a \"misunderstanding\" with the surveys.\nTarkanian didn\u2019t fill out the questionnaire in 2004 during his run for state Senate, and he received a C+ during his 2012 bid for a U.S. House seat. There\u2019s no record of a grade during his unsuccessful U.S. Senate primary bid in 2010.\nNevada Firearms Coalition president Don Turner said his state-based group gave Tarkanian an A rating in 2014, but doesn\u2019t plan to endorse in the current primary.\nRoberson has a consistent A from the NRA, receiving high marks during his 2010 and 2014 state Senate elections.\nTarkanian has generally run on a pro-Second Amendment platform since 2010. He\u2019s written multiple op-eds highly critical of an assault weapon ban and supported reciprocity for concealed weapon permits throughout different states.\nOn his current campaign website, Tarkanian clearly states his firearm policy: \"I oppose any and all efforts to register guns and their owners, and I oppose any and all efforts to restrict the sale or ownership of guns by law-abiding citizens.\"\nOur ruling\nA series of Web ads claim Tarkanian has an F rating from the NRA.\nTarkanian did receive an F rating from the NRA in 2006, and he also received the blessing of the pro-gun control Brady Campaign. But NRA endorsements are intended to only last for one election cycle, and Tarkanian has planted himself well within conservative orthodoxy on gun issues at least since 2010. In 2012, the most recent grade available, he earned a C+.\nRoberson\u2019s ad cherry-picked a decade-old rating and left out context about Tarkanian\u2019s more recent comments in opposition to gun control.
