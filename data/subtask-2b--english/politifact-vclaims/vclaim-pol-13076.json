We previously rated as True a claim from Milwaukee Ald. Milele Coggs that \"In its current state, this bill is the most restrictive voter ID legislation in the nation.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepublicans did, however, make several changes that put in doubt whether it's still the most restrictive, or just one of the most restrictive.\n\nBut in the weeks before the state Assembly approved the amended measure May 11, at least one photo ID backer in the state Senate put Wisconsin\u2019s status in a totally different light. (The Senate was poised to give final approval to the bill on May 19, 2011.)\n\nState Sen. Terry Moulton, R-Chippewa Falls, answered constituent concerns with a letter that made this claim:\n\n\"Wisconsin is one of the few states in the country that do not currently require a photographic identification.\"\n\nWe heard from two Moulton constituents -- Gail Halmstad of Chippewa Falls and Jim Dunning of Eau Claire -- who said they received those Moulton letters between late March and mid-April. Both said they question the need for a photo ID mandate at the polls.\n\nOthers, including state Sen. Alberta Darling, R-River Hills, have made similar statements.\n\n\"I think most people just want to get the issue off the table and say, yeah, we should have an ID in order to vote. Most states have an ID for voting,\" Darling told a WTMJ-TV (Channel 4) reporter for a May 11, 2011 story.\n\nDarling didn\u2019t say \"photo\" ID, so her statement can\u2019t be equated with that of Moulton. But that\u2019s what the bill requires and what she supports, so her comment may have left the impression with viewers that she meant most states have photo ID for voting.\n\nMoulton\u2019s statement was simple and straightforward.\n\nSo is our evaluation, since we have been down this road before.\n\nThe definitive source for up-to-date information on state-by-state requirements for voter identification is the nonpartisan National Conference of State Legislatures\u2019 online guide, \"Voter Identification Requirements.\"\n\nSo is it true that Wisconsin is one of the few states that lacks a photo ID rule for voting?\n\nActually, it\u2019s the opposite.\n\nOnly eight states currently request or require a photo ID to vote, according to the group.\n\nA ninth state, Kansas, will require photo ID as of 2012, we found. (The Wisconsin law would take effect in 2012 as well, barring a court injunction.)\n\nAnother 18 states require some form of identification, but it does not have to include a picture.\n\nThat tally will move to 19 in July 2011 when Oklahoma election officials begin requesting photo ID, according to the group.\n\nThese numbers could change more in the months ahead. According to Brennan Center for Justice research, 37 states including Wisconsin are considering or have considered voter ID and/or proof of citizenship legislation in recent months.\n\nBut currently Wisconsin is in a very large group of states that do not require photo ID to vote -- not \"one of the few\" who do not. Most states do not ask or mandate photo ID.\n\nMoulton\u2019s office told us they inadvertently erred in the constituent letter and have omitted the claim in letters that have gone out recently. Elise Nelson, an aide to Moulton, gave us a copy of the revised letter she said went out on May 10, and it does not include the earlier claim.\n\nBut it does not correct it either, so recipients may still have the impression the earlier claim is fact.\n\nNelson said she did not know where Moulton\u2019s office came up with the original claim.\n\nThe bottom line?\n\nAs Wisconsin was on the verge of enacting a photo ID requirement for voting, Moulton said the state was one of only a few without one. But as senators prepared to cast their final vote, most states still do not require photo ID to vote.\n\nMoulton\u2019s claim to constituents, as his office notes, was well off target.\n\nWe rate it False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13076"}
