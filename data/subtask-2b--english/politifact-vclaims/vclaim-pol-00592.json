Donna Campbell, R-New Braunfels, took to Twitter to voice her concern over rising property taxes and to vouch for two of her bills.\n\"Local Government debt in Texas has increased nearly 40% in the past 5 years,\" Cambell wrote in a tweet. \"This trend is raising Texans\u2019 property taxes. I filed SB 462 & SB 1090 to make it harder for cities to borrow unsustainable debt that leads to higher property taxes.\"\nWe were curious about the first part of her claim \u2014\u00a0has local government debt really increased by nearly 40% in the past five years?\nDebt issued vs. debt outstanding\nCampbell\u2019s spokeswoman Alice Claiborne said the number came from the 2018 Local Government Annual Report produced by the Texas Bond Review Board, a state board comprising Gov. Greg Abbott, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, Comptroller Glenn Hegar and House Speaker Dennis Bonnen, R-Lake Jackson, that oversees debt and debt financing across the state.\nThese annual reports, produced by the board\u2019s staff, look at trends in local government debt and include data from cities and counties and from school, health, water and community college districts, as well as from other special districts.\nClaiborne pointed us to a specific line in the report, which says that, over the past five fiscal years, \"local government debt issuance\" has increased 38.6%, rising to $32.65 billion in fiscal 2018.\nCase closed, right? Not so fast.\nSeveral debt and budget experts said Campbell\u2019s tweet refers only to debt, which could leave the impression that she is talking about the growth in total debt held by local governments, or debt outstanding, which has actually increased at a much lower rate.\nThe same report shows that over the past five fiscal years, outstanding debt held by local governments has grown 17.7% to about $230 billion at the end of the 2018 fiscal year.\nDebt issuance, the value Campbell\u2019s staff pointed to, is the total principal amount of debt sold. Debt outstanding is the principal owed over the remaining life of all debt issues, according to a glossary from the comptroller\u2019s office.\n\"I think the difference is subtle,\" said Bill Fulton, director of the Kinder Institute for Urban Research at Rice University, in an email. \"Clearly, local debt issuance grew by almost 40%. But local debt outstanding grew by only 17% because of refinancing, payoffs, etc.\"\nFulton said the accuracy of Campbell\u2019s statement depends on how the viewer interprets her remark, but added that he read her tweet as referring to outstanding debt.\n\"But that\u2019s just the way I look at it,\" he said.\nJon Oliver, Campbell\u2019s chief of staff, defended her remark and rejected the idea that her claim is inaccurate due to different interpretations of the word debt.\n\"I would add that however it might be inferred, what she wrote was not inaccurate,\" Oliver said in an email. \"I understand different folks may interpret things differently. That\u2019s also the nature of a tweet.\"\nOliver also noted that both pieces of legislation referenced in Campbell\u2019s tweet \u2014 Senate Bills 462 and 1090 \u2014 are about bond elections, or new debt.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth bills would change the election process involving local bond proposals. One would require bond propositions on ballots to include more details, and the other would require a two-thirds majority of voters to approve bond propositions affecting property taxes.\nWhile both bills are about debt issuance, the analysis accompanying both proposals references how new bonds contribute to outstanding debt and in turn affect property tax rates.\nIn fact, the analysis for Senate Bill 462 includes a statement that mirrors the language Campbell used in her tweet \u2014\u00a0but it explicitly refers to outstanding debt.\n\"Outstanding local bond debt in Texas has dramatically increased in recent years, contributing to the rapid rise of property taxes,\" the analysis reads.\nThe analysis for Senate Bill 1090 discusses the need for property tax rates to generate \"sufficient revenue to provide payment of debt service on outstanding and projected General Obligations debt.\"\nGiven the status of both bills and what little time remains in this year\u2019s legislative session, both proposals are unlikely to be adopted.\nNarrow scope offers better analysis\nEva DeLuna Castro, a budget analyst at the Center for Public Policy Priorities, said she would not have guessed that Campbell\u2019s remark was about new debt as opposed to debt outstanding, even after looking at the legislation referenced in the tweet.\nGiven the focus on how debt impacts property taxes, DeLuna Castro said Campbell should have narrowed her focus to look at tax-supported debt as opposed to outstanding debt in total, which includes revenue-supported debt.\n\"That\u2019s the part of debt that matters as far as property taxes are concerned,\" she said in an email. \"Revenue-backed debt is paid off in other ways \u2013 user fees, customer charges (like for a utility), sales taxes, etc.\"\nOutstanding tax-supported debt held by local governments has increased 21.2% in the past five years, to $150.22 billion; new tax-supported debt issued by local governments has increased by 32.3% in the past five years.\nRob Latsha, director of the Texas Bond Review Board, and Braxton Parsons, a policy analyst at the board, said they would look at outstanding debt in the scenario Campbell described. And even then they would restrict their analysis to general obligation debt, which is backed by the credit and taxing power of a local entity.\nIf Campbell insisted on looking just at debt issuance, Latsha and Parsons said she should have looked just at new money and excluded issuance used to refund existing debt.\nDuring fiscal 2018, the board\u2019s report showed that more than 36% of local debt issuance was used to refund debt.\nBoth Latsha and Parsons also warned that it is tricky to draw conclusions about how increases in debt might impact property taxes by using numbers found in their annual reports, since all local governments are lumped together and the report does not account for things like local property values and tax rates.\nOur ruling\nCampbell said local government \"debt in Texas has increased nearly 40% in the past 5 years.\"\nCampbell's staff said she was referring to an increase in the amount of debt issued by local governments, which has increased about 38% in the past five years. But experts said her tweet was imprecise and left the impression that she was referring to outstanding debt, which has increased about 17% in the past five years.\nPlus, experts said looking at an increase in overall debt issued by local governments is not the best way to analyze how debt impacts tax rates.\nWe rate this claim Half True.\n\nHALF TRUE \u2013 The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.\n\u00a0\n Share the Facts 2019-05-24 15:19:54 UTC   PolitiFact    4 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Half True  \"Local Government debt in Texas has increased nearly 40% in the past 5 years.\"    Donna Campbell State Senator    a tweet Wednesday, May 15, 2019 2019-05-15    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00592"}
