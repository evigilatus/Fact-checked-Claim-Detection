(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nWhile we found that several candidates Obama supported on the campaign trail did indeed lose, it certainly wasn\u2019t all of them.\nObama endorsed more than 300 Democratic candidates in federal and state races across the country, according to National Public Radio.\nBecause the Facebook post specifically says \"campaigned,\" those are the races we will focus on.\nFrom what we could find, the former president traveled around the U.S. and campaigned for dozens of candidates.\nWhile some experienced losses, many also experienced wins; such as Jacky Rosen, who won a Senate seat in Nevada; Tony Evers, who won the governorship in Wisconsin and Sen. Tim Kaine, who won re-election in Virginia.\nThe post cites and quotes an opinion story from the Washington Examiner. However, nowhere in that story does it say that \"all\" the candidates Obama stumped for lost.\nBut it did highlight three: Andrew Gillum, Sen. Bill Nelson and Stacey Abrams.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut even those losses are far from set in stone. We'll explain.\nRecounts and runoffs\nIn Florida, a state known for razor-thin election margins, several recounts are underway including for Gillum and\u00a0Nelson.\nOn election night, Gillum was trailing Republican Ron DeSantis in the race for governor by 77,377 votes when he called DeSantis to congratulate him. But the votes were still being counted. Similarly, Nelson, the Democratic incumbent, was trailing Republican Gov. Rick Scott by a small margin when Scott declared victory just after midnight. Again, the votes were still being counted.\nBy Friday, Nov. 10, with unofficial election results finally in from every Florida county, the Democratic candidates in both races were behind by very small counts: DeSantis was leading Gillum by 0.41 percent, or 33,684 votes; and Scott was leading Nelson in the Senate race by 0.15 percent, or 12,562 votes.\nThat\u2019s when Florida Secretary of State Ken Detzner ordered a statewide machine recount of over 8.2 million ballots in races for three races, including U.S. Senate and governor.\nFlorida law requires an automatic machine recount in any race where the margin of victory is within one half of one percentage point.\nIn Georgia, it\u2019s not quite as close, but Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams is not conceding. Republican challenger Brian Kemp, who had been the Georgia\u2019s Secretary of State for eight years leading up through last week\u2019s election, resigned his position overseeing the state\u2019s elections on Nov. 8, two days after Election Day, when it became clear his margin of victory could be small enough as to force a runoff.\nBy Monday night, unofficial returns showed that\u00a0Kemp\u00a0was leading by about 58,000 votes.\nBut questions about the state\u2019s handling of provisional ballots and voter registration system led a federal judge to order a delay in certifying the results until officials conduct a formal review of those issues.\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post claims that every candidate Obama hit the campaign trail for lost in Tuesday\u2019s election.\nThat\u2019s just plain wrong.\nObama did rally for Democratic candidates who ended up losing, but the same goes for several others he supported who won their races.\nWe rate this claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01264"}
