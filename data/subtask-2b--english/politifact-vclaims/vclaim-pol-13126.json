Lena Taylor says Gov. Scott Walker hasn\u2019t created jobs, gives millions to friends and raises taxes on working people", "text": "Since budget protesters descended upon Madison in February 2011, Wisconsin has seen a barrage of television commercials, news releases and radio spots, with each side blasting the other.\n\nOne news release was particularly harsh:\n\nAs the Legislature\u2019s budget-writing committee opened its hearings on the governor\u2019s spending plan, state Sen. Lena Taylor (D-Milwaukee) issued a news release March 29, 2011, that made several sharp claims about Republican Gov. Scott Walker -- all rolled into one neat sentence:\n\n\"Gov. Walker has yet to create a job, he gives away millions to his friends, and he raises taxes on working people.\"\n\nIncompetence, corruption and raising taxes: sounds like the political equivalent of the trifecta.\n\nLet\u2019s examine Taylor\u2019s statement, one claim at a time. \u00a0\n\nClaim #1: \"Gov. Walker has yet to create a job.\"\n\nThis goes at one of Walker\u2019s main promises, to create 250,000 new jobs in his first term.\n\nWalker spokesman Cullen Werwie said: \"(Walker) typically talks about growing jobs in light of ensuring Wisconsin has a business climate that allows the private sector to create 250,000 new jobs, which is different than claiming the governor will directly create 250,000 new jobs.\"\n\nOfficials are quick to claim the credit for job growth, and even quicker to assign blame elsewhere for job loss, but employment gains have much more to do with the economic cycle than individual politicians, said Bruce Hansen, an economics professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n\nNevertheless, if a person is in higher office at the time the economy tanks or improves, he or she typically gets the credit or the blame. So, let\u2019s look at what has happened since Walker took office in January 2011.\n\nAccording to Department of Workforce Development statistics, the state had a net gain of more than 13,000 jobs in January and February. To be sure, Walker\u2019s policies hardly had time to take effect in that time frame, but that\u2019s not what Taylor is citing as evidence.\n\nTaylor said when she calculated the net job gain in January and February she took into account thousands of potential jobs that were lost when Walker killed a high-speed rail line to Madison.\n\nIn the past, Democratic groups have claimed somewhere between 10,000 and 13,000 jobs were lost when Walker rejected $810 million in federal funding for the new train link between Milwaukee and Madison.\n\nPolitiFact gave a Barely True and Pants on Fire rating to variations on this claim, since -- among other reasons -- the groups double counted the number of jobs that were to be created.\n\nBeyond that, the projections did not measure other impacts.\n\nWalker might have saved some jobs in the airline, auto and gas industries by killing the rail line, said Steven E. Polzin, an expert on rail proposals from the Center for Urban Transportation Research at the University of South Florida, a pro cars and roads group.\n\nBut even if we were to accept Taylor\u2019s calculations when it comes to subtracting jobs lost that were never created in the first place, and disregard Polzin\u2019s thinking, Wisconsin still gained at least \"a\" job this year under Walker\u2019s watch.\n\nClaim #2: \"He gives away millions to his friends.\"\n\nIn politics, friends can be a fairly ambiguous term. It can mean campaign contributors, ideological supporters or actual ... friends.\n\nDoes Taylor mean Walker literally gives million-dollar handouts to his golf buddies? Or that he uses state money to reward the governor\u2019s supporters?\n\nTaylor said she meant the latter.\n\n\"Throughout the January 2011 special session, the governor proposed and signed into law over $140 million in tax credits and contributions, which flows to a predominately corporate environment which has been strongly supportive and friendly to the governor,\" she told PolitiFact Wisconsin.\n\nBut Taylor\u2019s evidence doesn\u2019t exactly hold up after scrutiny.\n\nFor starters, the $140 million in tax credits and contributions don\u2019t flow to \"a predominately corporate environment.\" \u00a0\n\nThat figure incorporates a couple of different bills, including the Economic Development Tax Credit, which includes tax benefits for every job Wisconsin businesses create, and a tax break for Health Savings Accounts.\n\nThe Health Saving Accounts deduction primarily benefits individual workers who have an HSA, whether the workers voted for Walker or not. This credit allows people to deduct contributions they make to Health Savings Accounts from their state income taxes, as they can from their federal income taxes. Almost every other state already allows this.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAnd while the Economic Development Tax Credit does include a provision giving corporate companies additional tax cuts for locating their regional or national headquarters in Wisconsin, all businesses are eligible for the job creation tax breaks.\n\nIn other words, whether businesses are Walker\u2019s friend or foe, they can obtain tax benefits from adding jobs.\n\nTaylor also cited the recent Jack Links controversy, in which the snack food company was awarded a $75,000 grant. The company and its CEO made nearly $50,000 in contributions to the Republican Governor\u2019s Association, which spent $5 million to help get Walker elected.\n\nWhile Jack Links was awarded $75,000 after contributing $50,000 to Republican causes, the grant handed to the beef jerky company doesn\u2019t validate Taylor\u2019s statement. She has not provided evidence the company received the grant because of the political donations.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the grant was for tens of thousands -- not millions -- of dollars. And the news release that was critical of the grant came out six days after Taylor's original statement.\n\nClaim #3: \"He raises taxes on working people.\"\n\nTaylor\u2019s evidence for this claim was pretty straightforward: \"Governor Walker strips $41 million from the Earned Income Tax Credit in his 2011-\u201913 budget. \u00a0This move reduces the credit available for persons eligible for the EITC which means that their tax liability is increased or refund reduced.\"\n\nWalker\u2019s response?\n\n\"Her blanket statement about taxing the working class is way too broad in scope and factually inaccurate when you look at the impact of taxes in the budget on the worker,\" spokesman Werwie told PolitiFact Wisconsin. \"While the EITC credit will decrease, Senator Taylor doesn\u2019t talk about Governor Walker\u2019s efforts to hold Wisconsin\u2019s income and sales tax steady. The EITC only hits some workers.\"\n\nHe also argued there is a net decrease in taxes under Walker\u2019s budget.\n\nThis is true if we combine all of Walker\u2019s tax policies. However, Taylor was referring only to taxes on working class people, which the Earned Income Tax Credit reduction affects the most.\n\nAnd the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau backs up Taylor\u2019s view that the change is a tax increase in an April 15, 2011 memo. In that memo, the bureau listed the EITC change under the \"tax increases\" section, saying families with multiple children will pay more to the state.\n\nWhere does all of this leave us?\n\nIn her statement, Taylor said \"Gov. Walker has yet to create a job, he gives away millions to his friends, and he raises taxes on working people.\"\n\nBut the state gained 13,000 jobs in January and February, ruining Taylor\u2019s argument of \"yet to create a job.\" Walker has not given away millions of dollars to \"friends,\" and the \"corporate\" tax cuts cited as evidence by Taylor are, for the most part, available to all businesses in Wisconsin.\n\nBy taking out funds from the Earned Income Tax Credit, Walker has raised taxes on \"working people,\" meaning Taylor was spot on with one of her claims.\n\nTaylor batted one for three in her news release-- great numbers for a baseball player, but not a strong percentage on the Truth-O-Meter.\n\nWe rate Taylor\u2019s statement as a whole as Barely True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEditor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.
