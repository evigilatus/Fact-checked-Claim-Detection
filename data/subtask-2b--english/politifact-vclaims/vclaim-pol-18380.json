Because the agency can\u2019t track each case of influenza through its weekly surveillance data, it provides an estimated range to \"reflect the larger burden,\" its website says.\nAccording to preliminary CDC data, there were anywhere from 24,000 to 62,000 American flu deaths from Oct. 1, 2019, through April 4, 2020. As of May 16, reported pediatric flu deaths for the 2019-20 influenza season were at 176.\nFlu fatalities are based on death certificate data, which are collected and estimated each week by the National Center for Health Statistics within the CDC. According to the NCHS weekly tally of influenza deaths, about 8,000 Americans have died from influenza from January 2020 to May 16, 2020. This is not counting deaths caused by pneumonia, which is a common complication of the flu.\nThe CDC says that COVID-19, which has now killed nearly 100,000 Americans, is affecting the way people are seeking health care, so data should be interpreted with caution.\nWhile the CDC\u2019s figures are estimates and considered preliminary, the claim that no Americans have died from the flu in 2020 is Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18380"}
