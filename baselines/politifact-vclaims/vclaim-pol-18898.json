Both of their Twitter profiles show that neither posted the tweets on Sept. 8, and the post isn\u2019t among archives of Trump\u2019s deleted tweets.\u00a0\nThe post was created by @SavageSportsMMZ, a satirical sports social media account whose watermark can be seen in the background of the post.\u00a0\nThe fake tweet was then reposted on a Facebook page called NFL memes and has been shared thousands of times since. The page says it posts parody NFL-related memes, but many users didn\u2019t seem to know that and criticized Trump and Kaepernick in the post\u2019s comments.\u00a0\nWe rate this Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18898"}
