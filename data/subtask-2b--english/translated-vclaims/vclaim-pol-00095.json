Buck Obama asked Ukraine to investigate his campaign manager, his political rival, three members of the Democratic Senate asked Ukraine to investigate Trump, and DNC asked Ukraine to assist in the search for dirt on Trump. The media were silent about all this, Kirk wrote in September 29. This is your daily reminder: Barack Obama asked Ukraine to investigate the director of his political rival's campaign.3 Members of the Democratic Senate asked Ukraine to investigate Trump and the Ukrainian National Congress asked Ukraine to assist in the search for dirt on Trump. The media shut up about all this -- Charlie Kirk (@charlikerk11) September, 2019 Democrats in the House of Representatives initiated an investigation against President Donald Trump after they discovered that he had urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelinski to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a potential rival in the 2020 presidential election. Kirk and Trump and the other conservatives tried to charge the Democrats by mistake. During a press conference on September 25, Trump accused the members of the Democratic Senate that \"they did what they accused me of, which I did not do.\" But what are the facts about these allegations? We decided to break Kirk's tweet and see how each of his three allegations came to the facts. Simply put, all three are oversimplified and misleading. \"Brack Obama asked Ukraine to investigate the director of his political rival\" this allegation is unsubstantiated. We found no evidence that former President Barack Obama asked Ukraine to investigate Paul Manafort, former Trump campaign manager. In a statement to Poletti Fuckett, Kirk's spokesman referred to op-ed articles in the Washington Post, Fox News and The Hill. According to one of these articles by John Solomon the Hill, investigators from the Ukrainian National Anti-Corruption Office met with United States officials in January 2016 to discuss the coordination of their anti-corruption efforts. In 2014, the Ministry of Justice of Obama, a former official of the Ukrainian Embassy, told the Federation officials to revive a closed investigation into payments to Manafort by former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who fled Ukraine in 2014 in the midst of protests. However, Tilezhenko - who worked at the Embassy for less than a year, according to the Washington Post - also said that he could not remember whether Manafort was specifically mentioned at the meeting. As Solomon quoted from Telezhenko and another Ukrainian official who links the January 2016 meeting with the issuance of a book of accounts months later showing off-books payments from the Yanukovych political party to Manafort. In a recent news article in Washington Post, Serhi Lechchenko, a Ukrainian MP and investigative journalist who revealed the existence of the ledger at a press conference, wrote that he was not working with the intention of helping Democrats. \"This was Lyshchenko's coming,\" said Stephen Beaver, Senior Fellow of the Brookings Institution and former United States Ambassador to Ukraine under the presidency of President Bill Clinton. \"Nothing I've seen suggests he did so at the request of the Obama White House.\" John Herbest, Director of the Eurasia Centre in the Atlantic Council and former Ambassador in Ukraine, under the leadership of President George W. Bush, said that the issuance of the ledger was not unusual: \"When the ledger appeared, as someone who has been closely watching Ukraine for the past five years, this seemed quite a natural development given Ukraine's own policy.\" Herbest said that Ukrainians were already interested in Manafort because of his connections to Pianokovic. They became more interested when Manafort became part of the Trump campaign. \"I'm a little skeptical about the idea that you have Ukrainians meeting with the Ministry of Justice to develop a strategy on this thing,\" said Herbest. \"I can't honestly tell you it's wrong.\" Whatever was said, it is also important to note that the alleged discussion took place in January 2016, while Trump did not hire Manafort to work on his campaign until March 2016. Manafort was named campaign leader in May 2016. On January 13, 2021, Jake Taber stated in his CNN remarks that Donald Trump's second presidential isolation was \"the most isolated of the two parties in American history.\" A Obama spokesman who refused to comment. \"Three members of the Democratic Senate asked Ukraine to investigate Trump.\" This allegation distorts what happened. In May 2018, Suns. Dick Dorbin of Illinois, Patrick Lehe of Vermont and Bob Men\u00e9ndez of New Jersey wrote a letter to Yuri Lutsenko, Attorney General of Ukraine, urging him to cooperate with former Special Advocate Robert Muller in the investigation of interference in the Russian elections. Members of the Senate, citing an article from The New York Times, noted that Ukraine had reportedly stopped four investigations concerning the Mueller probe for fear that the country &apos; s cooperation might have jeopardized its ability to obtain financial and military aid from the United States. \"If these reports are correct, and we strongly encourage you to reverse the course and stop any efforts to obstruct cooperation with this important investigation,\" they wrote. Members of the Senate also asked whether the Trump Administration had encouraged Ukrainian officials to obstruct Mueller &apos; s investigations in Ukraine. But they didn't ask Ukraine to investigate Trump, as Kirk falsely claimed. In a recent press release, senators made their intentions clear. \"This was not about asking for an investigation, but to follow up on the New York Times report that the Ukrainian Attorney General was finishing his ongoing investigations rather than cooperating with M\u00f8ller's inquiries about Manafort,\" said the spokesman for Liay David Carl Politifact. \"DNC requested Ukraine's assistance to dig dirt on Trump\" this allegation is misleading. This is due to the report of Politico 2017, which we have considered before. According to the report, a Ukrainian-American consultant to the National Democratic Commission examined conflicting information about Manafort and revealed some findings to officials of the Ukrainian Embassy and the Ukrainian National Defence Service. However, Kirk &apos; s claim overestimates the report &apos; s findings. There is no evidence that the Ukrainian National Council was working directly with the Government of Ukraine. The Chancellor, Alexandra Shaluba, Politiko, told that she had taken on her obligation to research Manafort &apos; s relations with Yanukovych, the former Ukrainian President, who had been expelled. As the Trump campaign escalated, I began to look into Trump's relations with Prussia as well. According to the report, Shaloba shared some rumours and conclusions with officials of the National Democratic Party and the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign. The day after Tramp Manafort was hired, the ANC Communications Group reported on Manafort and Trump and their links with Russia. The hacked e-mails also show her to tell an IND official a few months later that she has more information about Manafort. The Pulitico report also said that the Dutch National Congress had encouraged Chalopa to ask the staff of the Ukrainian Embassy whether former Ukrainian President Petru Porushenko, successor to Yanukovych, would be willing to ask a question from a correspondent about Manafort's appointment and his links to Pianokovic. But a former DNC employee told Polisco that DNC wasn't going out or leading her business. Shaloba raised a problem with the Polytico article in an article on Facebook. She told CNN that she was not an opposition researcher and that the National Police had never asked her to look for dirt from Ukraine. Several officials of the National Congress Party and Clinton Campaign also denied working with the Government of Ukraine. Kenneth Vogel, a reporter behind Polyteco's story, explained on Twitter that \"DNC consultant did not retrieve DNA\" in her contacts with Ukrainians. Adrian Watson, spokesman for the United States National Council, told Politi Fact that Chalopa was a part-time consultant hired to assist the United States National Council in \"participation in communication with American ethnic communities.\" Watson said: \"The holding of the National Democratic Conference with Chaloba allowed her to obtain other clients and/or engage in activities not on behalf of the National Democratic Conference, which she supposedly did.\" The Governor, Kirk, said: \"Brack Obama asked Ukraine to investigate his campaign manager, his political rival, three members of the Democratic Senate, who asked Ukraine to investigate Trump, Kirk's three allegations are rooted in events or incidents that have occurred, but they oversimplify what has happened in a way that gives a misleading impression. We're evaluating this statement mostly wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00095"}
