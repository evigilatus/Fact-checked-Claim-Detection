Scott Walker and Republican lawmakers.\n\nRepublicans\u2019 primary goal was to make it easier to block unreliable expert testimony and so-called junk science in negligence lawsuits against businesses.\n\nBut the change applies to all types of civil and criminal actions, a move that led the state district attorney\u2019s association to predict before passage that the new rules would \"significantly curtail our ability to prove our cases\" -- including in charges of operating while intoxicated.\n\nThat aspect of the law got a sharper characterization when the Democratic Party of Wisconsin -- gearing up for a recall drive against Walker -- blasted the governor on a host of issues.\n\nAmid complaints about the budget bill, concealed carry legislation and changes related to sex-ed in schools, the party in a news release declared that a Walker administration move makes it so that \"drunk drivers who kill have an easier time of it.\"\n\nAmid the rhetoric is an interesting claim:\n\nDoes Act 2, the legal reform legislation, really mean an easier go for drunken drivers, either in criminal prosecutions or in personal injury suits against them?\n\nAsked to back up its claim, the Democrats cited three pieces of evidence: Mothers Against Drunk Drivers\u2019 opposition to Act 2; the bill\u2019s limits on court-ordered punitive damages in civil cases; and changes that make it harder for people to testify as experts.\n\nBut Republicans decided to exempt drunken-driving crash victims from the punitive damage limits in civil cases. So that point is off the mark.\n\nThe Mothers Against Drunk Drivers position is a moving target. The group opposed the bill initially, but then dropped its opposition after lawmakers added the punitive damage exemption -- and is now seeking a partial legislative fix in reaction to the new evidence rules.\n\nAs for the evidence rules themselves, prosecutors say the issue is real and the change puts new pressures on them.\n\nWe talked to numerous lawyers and researchers and they said the changes were significant, but welcome in concept. Almost all agreed the old standards allowed in too much. The new standards are used in federal courts, and by more than 30 states.\n\nSince the bill\u2019s Feb. 1, 2011 start date, challenges to OWI evidence have played out in courtrooms and prosecutor\u2019s offices under the new law. Both sides expect many more battles as the \"Daubert standard\" rules (from a Supreme Court case, Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc.) come into play in more cases.\n\nIn our interviews with lawyers in several counties, we did not discover any OWI homicide trials affected by the new Daubert standard -- the focus of the Democrats\u2019 claim. But those cases would be subject to the same advantages and disadvantages as other OWI cases.\n\nAnd there are some examples we can dig into there:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSt. Croix County: In a criminal case of alleged driving drunk with a child passenger, defense attorney Aaron Nelson used the new evidence standards to challenge the vision test in which an officer moves a finger or item in front of a suspect\u2019s eyes. After the trial began, the judge disallowed testimony about the eye test. A jury on Nov. 1, 2011 found the defendant not guilty.\n\n\n\nDane County: A pretrial defense challenge to field sobriety tests in a second-offense OWI case led a judge to block the arresting officer from answering whether he believed the suspect was impaired -- a common question at trials and one that is typically a powerful weapon for prosecutors. The case, already weak due to a paperwork error during the arrest, was pleaded down to reckless use of a vehicle, said assistant district attorney Everett Mitchell.\n\n\n\nSheboygan County: Prosecutors beat back a Daubert challenge, but others are pending, leading District Attorney Joe DeCecco to plot a strategy of aggressive pretrial attempts to argue that officers and others can testify as experts on intoxication. \"Most of the Daubert challenges have been on drunk driving,\" DeCecco noted.\n\n\n\nOzaukee County: In a drunken driving case, a defense lawyer challenged the qualifications of people who collect and store blood at state hygiene labs that do forensic testing for such cases, according to District Attorney Adam Gerol. The case is pending.\n\n\nIn the very early stages here, we found that a loose cadre of defense attorneys are sharing tips on how to mount challenges that DAs told us cause worrisome delays. \"This will protract cases in the long run,\" said Gerol, who likes the Daubert standard overall.\n\nBut what\u2019s been the experience of prosecutors and defense lawyers in states that already have Daubert?\n\nNationally, the reality doesn\u2019t look one-sided, we found.\n\nGenerally speaking prosecutors have found the new standards to be fairly neutral, just more work in defending the reliability of tests and witnesses, said Scott Burns, executive director of the National District Attorneys Association.\n\nOn the defense side, national expert Michael Hawkins of Atlanta, said the tougher rules could produce an \"unintended benefit\" for some defendants, but only when evidence doesn\u2019t pass legal muster.\n\n\"It doesn\u2019t make it \u2018easier\u2019 on drunk drivers,\" said Hawkins, a National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers\u2019 expert on drunken driving issues. \"It makes it so prosecutors have to do more work to assure judges and juries that the evidence they are using is accurate and reliable.\"\n\nYes, prosecutors in Wisconsin are having a tougher go of it in first skirmishes here.\n\nBut the rules apply to both sides.\n\nDefense attorneys acknowledge they will have have to introduce better and more reliable evidence under the new standards as well.\n\nIn fact, Andrew Mishlove, a nationally certified OWI defense lawyer who is helping train judges and lawyers on the new standards, told us a half-dozen common defense strategies might wilt now under the tougher evidence rules.\n\nAmong them: That testing equipment failed, or that radio frequency interference led to false readings of blood-alcohol level.\n\nOverall the new standard will \"prevent the defense from putting on bogus experts or questionable experts,\" said Donald Ramsell, an Illinois-based OWI lawyer who is nationally recognized.\n\nRamsell noted something pertinent to the Democrats\u2019 \u00a0claim about \"drivers who kill.\"\n\nHe and others said both sides will have a tougher time presenting testimony on estimates of a person\u2019s intoxication level at the time of an incident -- when the test wasn\u2019t taken until hours after the arrest. In fatal-crash homicide cases, the prosecution will be hurt more often in that scenario, Ramsell said, because often the drunken driver is often injured too, preventing a timely blood test.\n\nLooking ahead, what can we expect?\n\nOn the prosecution side, the big concern is that arresting officers were formerly treated as experts who could draw conclusions about sobriety tests -- but now are being challenged, along with the tests, and police training methods.\n\nIn cases that already have some evidence weaknesses -- for example, the defendant refused breath and blood tests, or the tests were delayed -- these challenges can be important, lawyers on both sides said.\n\nUnder the new system, judges are the gatekeepers of what is reliable and relevant scientific testimony, in contrast to past practice of letting juries hear almost everything.\n\nSome judges have concerns about testimony that has been routinely allowed in the past -- such as the follow-the-finger vision test known as Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (HGN). Those test are not allowed as evidence in some states.\n\n\"There are judges that feel like (the vision test) is voodoo because of a conception they have,\" said Emily Thompson, an assistant district attorney in Dane County who handles crash cases, including fatalities involving alcohol.\n\nSuch concerns have led the Wisconsin chapter of MADD, the advocacy group, to call for the Legislature to revisit Act 2and exempt drunken-driving cases from the new evidence rules.\n\n\"This aspect is troubling and MADD hopes the Legislature remedies the oversight as we support prosecutors who often face a daunting task in making sure justice is served and criminal charges relating to drunk driving are fully prosecuted,\" MADD spokesman Frank Harris told us.\n\nUltimately the state\u2019s high courts will decide how the issue plays out.\n\nBut most experts and lawyers are predicting neither side will gain clear advantage; others say wait and see. Some prosecutors see some advantages long-term. There\u2019s agreement that fairness will increase.\n\nSaid Marquette University law professor Daniel Blinka when asked if OWI defendants would have an easier time: \"I don\u2019t see how that\u2019s going to happen.\"\n\nOur conclusion\n\nThe Democratic Party of Wisconsin claimed that one of Walker\u2019s actions was to make it \"so that drunk drivers who kill have an easier time of it.\"\n\nOne of their talking points to back up the statement -- related to civil lawsuits -- doesn\u2019t hold up given amendments made to the bill. Their other issue, regarding Act 2\u2019s tougher standard for scientific testimony, clearly does affect drunken driving prosecutions.\n\nAnd the law already has benefited some drunken drivers, though not in every instance where scientific evidence was challenged. (We did not find a homicide case affected, but they would be subject to similarly varied effects as would regular OWI cases.) So we think there\u2019s an element of truth in the Dems\u2019 statement. Some defendants already have found an easier road.\n\nBut the statement implies the net effect of the law is tipped pro-defense. In OWI cases, that is an unknown at this point. Both sides -- defense and prosecution -- are subject to the new standards. And even defense-side experts don\u2019t buy the \"easier road\" argument.\n\nFinally, we think it\u2019s misleading to suggest -- as the party\u2019s statement did -- \u00a0that the intent of the bill was to favor homicidal drunken drivers. It clearly wasn\u2019t.\n\nWe rate the party\u2019s claim Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-12110"}
