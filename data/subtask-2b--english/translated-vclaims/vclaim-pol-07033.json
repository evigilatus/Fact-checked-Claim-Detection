Take, for example, his last post entitled, \"Nine facts of Democrats don't want you to hear them before you vote tomorrow.\" The article, published in November 3, 2014, which was sent to us by a reader, begins in this way: \"As we all get ready to go to the polls tomorrow, Democrats want to focus on the Coach brothers (that evil imaginary version with the elegant teeth, not the real ones who are excellent and very successful businessmen) and their \"war on women\" is foolish. The article goes on to present nine of the points that \"Democrats do not want to talk about,\" including economic claims, home ownership, taxation, debt and foreign policy. With regard to health-care policy, Cain offers the following: \"Obamacker is a failure! The number of people who lose their insurance is greater than the number who become newly insured, and 51 per cent of those registered at the stock exchanges say that they will not return to work because of the opportunity they will have next time. Then there are 29 persons (the number of persons is set at 29 hours per week due to the states of Obama) and 49 persons (not San Francisco who deliberately reside under 50 employees to avoid the state of coverage). There are also thousands of doctors who refuse patients who enjoy Obama &apos; s care coverage because they cannot afford reimbursement, while thousands of doctors retire early. This is too much for chewing, but we were particularly interested in verifying Cain's claim that \"many people lose their insurance (because of Obama's care) more than they become modern believers. (No question was asked to Kayin's employees.) We will begin with a great warning: the available data on this issue is incomplete. For beginners, the historically more credible long-term statistics on health coverage and non-insurance - the annual figures published by the United States Census Bureau - do not include the significant increase in insurance signatures that occurred during the first quarter of 2014, the 2014 deadline for obtaining insurance under the Affordable Care Act. The rest is data collected by the private sector. However, the figures for new signatures are rather partial, with a less certain historical record than census data. The numbers for cancellations are more blurry. However, we will consider consensus on data collected by private sector organizations. This has been calculated on a net basis - the number of newly covered Americans less the number of newly undercover Americans. For Cain to be right, this number has to be negative -- more losses than gains. Really? He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. By Bill McCarthy: January 12, 2021 the Gallup polling company studies non-insurance rates every quarter in a reasonable way in real time. In its most recent study, covering the third quarter of 2014, Gallup found that 13.4 per cent of Americans lacked health insurance. This is a significant reduction from its rate of 18 per cent in the third quarter of 2013, before health-care exchanges begin. As a reminder, the benefits of insurance coverage under the Health Care Act originate from several sources, including those who signed up for exchange schemes, those who were newly able to register for Medicaid coverage in the states that allowed it, and young adults under the age of 26 who were allowed to remain in their parents &apos; plan. These figures show a 4.6 percentage point decrease in the number of uninsured Americans since the law came into full force -- reversing the trend proposed by Cain. Between October 2013 and June 2014, Gallup found that 10.3 million non-old adults received health insurance coverage. This number is likely to have increased since the data interruption in June 2014. Christian Christians who are related to Christians are Christians. The New England Journal of Medicine estimated that 10.3 million adults received coverage until June. Also as of June, the Commonwealth Fund estimated this number at $9.5 million. During the same period, the Urban Institute provided an estimate of 8 million. A previous study - up to March - by Rand Corp. estimated a net gain of 9.3 million American adults with health insurance. This is a high degree of similarity between five separate studies, indicating a net increase of 9 million to 10 million as of June. There is reason to believe that this number can be higher. These estimates do not include children under the age of 18, and an additional number of Americans may have been insured in the months since June. Some other elements of Obama &apos; s care programme, including employers &apos; states, can certainly lead to further losses of coverage once it enters into force. (The Administration has deferred the start of employer contribution requirements.) There is no doubt that the administrative inconvenience caused by the loss of one's previous plan is an inconvenience, even if it ends up a different plan later. But so far, there is no evidence to support Cain's claim that a number of people lose coverage more than they earn. Our Governor Cain said that \"more people lose their insurance (because of Obama's care) from getting new insurance.\" While it is reasonable to ask questions about the limitations of available data, there is a broad consensus among five private sector organizations that the number of Americans insured today is about 10 million more than before the law began functioning in late 2013. This is not consistent with Cain's claim, so we wrongly assess it.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07033"}
