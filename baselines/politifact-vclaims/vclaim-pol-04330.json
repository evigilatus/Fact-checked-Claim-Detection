Trump\u2019s campaign did not respond to requests for information.\nBorder patrol processings\nWe couldn't find definitive\u00a0figures pointing to the 1 million estimate. But experts said it sounds reasonable based on figures we do have for U.S. entries and\u00a0how intertwined cities are in the border region.\nA spokesperson for U.S. Customs and Border Protection told us that along the southwest border, the daily average number of inbound legal crossings of pedestrians, passengers and crew into the United States has\u00a0increased in recent years.\nLegal crossing were 462,793 in fiscal year 2013, 483,501 in 2014, and 507,767 in 2015.\nCBP said 1 million daily crossings seemed accurate when taking into account outbound crossings, which the agency does not track.\nAn entry is recorded for every visit into the United States from Mexico, so one individual could represent multiple crossings in one day.\nTransportation Department data, compiled from the Homeland Security Department, reflect similar border flows.\nPedestrians and passengers on buses, trains and personal vehicles accounted for about 474,686 entries into the United States per day in fiscal year 2014, according to the department\u2019s border crossing/entry data.\nIn fiscal year 2015, that grew to about 496,660.\nReasons for travel\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe border region includes four U.S. states (California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas) and six Mexican states and is home to about 14 million people, according to December 2014 data from the Mexican government. The 2014 figures also say one million people cross the U.S.-Mexico border daily.\nBorder cities like El Paso/Juarez and San Diego/Tijuana \"are really single urban entities divided by an artificial border,\" said Douglas S. Massey, sociology and public affairs professor at Princeton University and director of the university\u2019s Office of Population Research.\n\"People often live on one side of the border and work on the other and vice versa, with huge movement in both directions,\" Massey said. \"There are also many, many daily trips in both directions for shopping, business and recreation.\"\nThe U.S. government also allows Mexican citizens to use Border Crossing Cards to enter the country from Mexico \"by land, or by pleasure vessel or ferry.\"\nBorder crossing cards allow people to go back and forth at will, Massey said.\nMany of the entries from Mexico to the United States also are Americans coming back into the country, Massey said. Crossings have increased since the North American Free Trade Agreement went into effect in 1994, he said.\n\"Legal border crossings at the dozens of ports of entries located along the U.S.-Mexican border significantly benefit both the U.S. and Mexican economies, which is why the numbers continue to rise,\" said Noe Garcia, president of the Border Trade Alliance, a nonprofit advocating for improved border affairs and trade relations among Canada, the United States and Mexico.\nTrade between the United States and Mexico in 2015 totaled about $583.6 billion, according to the Office of the United States Trade Representative. Commerce Department figures show United States exports of goods and services to Mexico also supported about 1.1 million jobs in 2014.\nWe emailed Mexican officials for their entry tallies, but didn\u2019t get a response.\nOur ruling\nTrump said the U.S.-Mexico border has \"1 million legal border crossings each and every day.\"\nBorder patrol and Transportation Department data show there are around half a million daily border crossings from Mexico into the United States. While that number doesn\u2019t necessarily represent unique individuals (rather total crossings), the border region is home to about 14 million people, many who cross back and forth between the nations to go to school, work and for recreational purposes.\nSo while there isn\u2019t a hard number pointing to the 1 million total crossings, experts believe it\u2019s a plausible estimate given the needs of the millions of people who live in the border region.\nWith that caveat, we rate Trump\u2019s statement Mostly True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2ea495f3-90ef-4d42-acec-8dc9edc98939", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04330"}
