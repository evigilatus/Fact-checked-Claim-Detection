If they are African-Americans, the real youth unemployment rate is 51 per cent.\" So a reader asked us to check if Sanders was right, so we took a good look. (Sanders seems to have made this a recent point in his campaign; a similar allegation was made in an interview with the nation). We will start by noting that the most common unemployment rate statistics are not high for each category, as Sanders pointed out. The most easily available data from the Bureau of Labour Statistics cover the 16 to 19 age group, which is not identical but gives a quick rough estimate. For whites in that age group, the official unemployment rate was 15.7 per cent, for Americans of Spanish origin 20.8 per cent and for Americans of African descent 31.8 per cent. In other words, the official unemployment rate shows the same general pattern - that the unemployment of African-American youth is much higher than that of white youth and, to a lesser extent, that of Spanish-born youth. However, the levels of each group are lower than what Sanders said. So what's going on? The Sanders camp referred to research carried out by the Institute for Economic Policy, a left-wing think tank. These data differ from the most common measurements for several reasons. On January 9, 2021, on Twitter, Sarah Goodlowski stated: \"Not all women lost jobs (in December's job report), most of them black and Latin women. In fact, white women got a job. On January 15, 2021, Nosiapa Mezan, the Institute looked not only at the employment situation of people between the ages of 17 and 20; it was limited to high school graduates who did not attend other studies. Second, the Expanded Programme on Immunization is no longer just unemployed workers, but also those who have been part-time workers due to the weakness of the economy and those who have been \"frequently associated with the labour force.\" The latter category includes persons who did not meet the strict definition of presence in the labour market, but were also not entirely outside the market. The statistics used, known as the U-6 shortcut, are officially called the measure of \"deficit employment\" instead of \"employment.\" The Institute itself used the term \"deficit labour\" in its research. It's a real statistical, but Sanders didn't really describe it the right way. The term \"unemployment rate\" was used twice and the term \"real unemployment rate,\" which is ambiguous and does not contain any formal definition in BLS and is not mentioned in EPI's research. On the other hand, Saunders &apos; choice of statistics has diminished its value. Since it was reasonable to assume that the unemployment rate of drop-outs was higher than that of secondary school graduates, the figure for \"young people who graduated from secondary school or dropped out of secondary school,\" he said, might be higher than 51 per cent, because that figure included only secondary school graduates. In general, economists agreed that Sanders had a point despite his problems with terminology. \"It should have been clearer,\" said Tara Sinclair, economist George Washington University. \"But I think the general scope is correct. Both education and race predict employment outcomes in the United States. A number of different studies show that even for the same levels of education, minorities seem to have worse intermediate employment outcomes.\" Our rule, Sanders, said that for African-Americans between the ages of 17 and 20, \"the real unemployment rate is 51 per cent.\" His terms were off, but the numbers he used were correct, and his general point was true -- that in comparing apples and lollipops, African-American youth have much worse prospects in the labour market than Spanish or white people. The statement is precise, but it needs further clarification or information, so we often evaluate it correctly.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06206"}
