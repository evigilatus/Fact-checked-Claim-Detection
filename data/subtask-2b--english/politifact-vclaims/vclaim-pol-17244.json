He\u2019s revived the talking point in the weeks since the Nov. 3 election, which he lost to Democratic President-elect Joe Biden.\nIn this case, he has a point that the federal form that registers someone to vote doesn\u2019t require documentation to show proof of citizenship. But Trump left out the efforts by many states to cross-check their records with available data to avoid this problem.\u00a0\nLofty penalties for lying\nPeople who wish to register to vote must attest under penalty of perjury that they are citizens and eligible to vote, according to federal law.\nBoth the federal registration form and state versions warn that making false statements is a crime and that noncitizens should not fill out the form.\nThe consequences for noncitizens registering or voting include deportation, incarceration or fines. Noncitizens risk that a government official will check their voting record during a background check if they apply for naturalization.\u00a0\n\"So anyone who\u2019s not a citizen, and lies, is setting themselves up not only for future prosecution, but tanking their ability to become a citizen some day,\" said Loyola Law School professor Justin Levitt.\nIn an Arizona voting case, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2013 that states are obligated to permit registration for federal elections using the federal form, which does not require documentary proof of citizenship. States may have their own form, but they must be willing to accept the federal form. Trump\u2019s spokesperson didn\u2019t respond to our request for evidence, but he specified \"federal elections\" in his statement.\nDatabases and driver\u2019s licenses: How states limit noncitizen voting\nIt\u2019s not apparent from Trump\u2019s claim, but many states have tried various means of confirming the citizenship status of voters. These methods have not been foolproof and have led to some errors and legal fights.\u00a0\nSome states have permission to use a federal resource of data, called the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, for the purposes of verifying that voter registration applicants are citizens. Implemented in 1987 and administered by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, SAVE was originally intended to verify eligibility for government benefits, such as Medicaid. SAVE , is not a database of people who are U.S. citizens, but it will show a person\u2019s immigration or citizenship status.\nArizona and Colorado election officials told us that they use SAVE. Florida tried, but it did not go well.\nFlorida election officials briefly used SAVE in 2012 as part of a voter purge effort, but it wrongly flagged many voters including a Brooklyn-born World War II veteran. The state scrapped the effort.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome states look at driver\u2019s license records to see whether any noncitizens also registered to vote. But driver\u2019s license records can be outdated and may not reflect if a noncitizen later became a naturalized citizen. That\u2019s part of why an effort in Texas to find noncitizen voters fell apart in 2019.\nWendy Underhill, an election expert at the National Conference of State Legislatures, said that in some states, driver\u2019s license records are better for verifying citizenship than they\u2019ve ever been. Some state driver\u2019s license systems are set up to ask a person if they want to register to vote only after they have shown a birth certificate or naturalization paper that proves citizenship.\u00a0\nWe contacted election officials in a few states to ask what steps they take to verify that voters are citizens.\nIn Colorado, election officials review the entire voter registration database to see if anyone is registered who showed a non-U.S. credential to receive a driver\u2019s license. The state uses the SAVE database as needed.\u00a0\nIn Georgia, applications for voter registration are compared with data from the state Department of Driver Services and the Social Security Administration.\nIn cases where the information does not match or an applicant is flagged as a noncitizen, the application is moved to pending status, and the applicant is notified as to how to resolve it, said Joe Sorenson, a spokesperson for Gwinnett County, outside Atlanta. The steps include a list of acceptable documents for proof of citizenship that can be submitted immediately or when they vote. They are not moved to the voter rolls until they can prove citizenship.\u00a0\nStates with laws on the books, but not in practice\nFour states have laws on the books that require additional proof of citizenship to register at the time of application, but only Arizona\u2019s is actually in effect, said Dale Ho, director of the voting rights project at the ACLU.\u00a0\nIn Arizona, applicants using the state registration form must provide proof of citizenship to be a \"full ballot\" voter to cast votes in local, state and federal races. That proof can be a state-issued ID such as a driver\u2019s license, as long as they obtained it while they were citizens, or other forms such as naturalization documents, birth certificate or passport. If the applicant provides a driver\u2019s license number, election officials will verify their citizenship using state motor vehicle records.\nIf applicants attest that they are citizens but provide no proof and the state can\u2019t verify their citizenship, those applicants can vote in federal races only. About 25,000 of the state\u2019s 4.2 million voters are \"federal only\" voters.\nKansas, Alabama and Georgia also have laws requiring documentary proof, but none is in effect, Ho said. Kansas\u2019 law was struck down in federal court in April; Alabama and Georgia never enforced their laws.\u00a0\u00a0\nA spokesperson for the Kansas secretary of state told us that they don\u2019t independently verify proof of citizenship.\nOur ruling\nTrump said, \"No state in the country verifies United States citizenship as a condition for voting in federal elections.\"\nThe kernel of truth here is that the federal form to register to vote doesn\u2019t require documentation to prove citizenship. But applicants who use that federal form, or register using state forms, must attest to being citizens. Voter registration forms warn applicants that signing the form with false information is a crime. There have been scattered cases of non-citizens who cast ballots, but among millions of votes cast they are statistically rare.\nSome states told us that they access federal or state databases to verify citizenship of voters. Such methods have sometimes erroneously flagged citizen voters. While they are not foolproof, they do contradict Trump\u2019s claim that no states verify U.S. citizenship for federal elections.\nWe rate this statement Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17244"}
