Marco Rubio, R-Fla., believes convicted felons should regain their right to own a gun but not the right to vote.\nThe meme, sent to us by a reader, presents two quotes purportedly by Rubio. The first, dated March 16, is, \"No, felons should not have their voting rights restored even after they have served their sentence.\" The second quote, from May 6, says, \"Of course, convicted felons should be allowed to own guns after they have done their time. It is their constitutional right.\"\nThe claim was attributed to the Facebook community group \"Stop the world, the teabaggers want off.\"\nWe\u2019ll note right off the bat that the group\u2019s Facebook page cops to being a primarily satirical site. It says, \"This page is for entertainment purposes. It is NOT meant to be taken seriously. It is primarily satire and parody with a mix of political memes and messages.\"\nStill, casual Facebook users are unlikely to see this bit of context and could easily take the quotes in the meme at face value, so we\u2019ll check the substance of the meme anyway. We searched Nexis and Google for the quotes and did not find any instances in which Rubio said those words. (We contacted spokespersons for Rubio and did not get a response. We also tried to contact the \"Teabaggers\" group via Twitter and Facebook but did not hear back.)\nFelons and voting rights\nStates have the power to decide how -- or whether -- to restore the rights of felons to vote once they have served their time. (Maine and Vermont allow felons to vote while in prison.)\nIn Florida in 2007 under then-Gov. Charlie Crist, the Cabinet agreed to relax the rules to make it easier for felons to regain their civil rights, including the right to vote. The Cabinet set rules for three levels of offenders who could apply to get their rights back, including the requirement that they had to finish their sentences.\nAt the time, Rubio was the speaker of the House, but since the Cabinet set the rules, the Legislature had no official role.\nWhen Rubio ran against Crist for a U.S. Senate seat in 2010, he attacked his record on restoration of voting rights.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2009, Rubio said on Morning Joe that Crist \"restored the rights of felons to vote automatically here in Florida.\" The following year, Rubio said Crist \"worked with ACORN and groups like that to give felons voting rights in Florida.\" (ACORN, or the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, dissolved in 2010 in the wake of a video sting that showed ACORN employees telling people posing as a pimp and a prostitute how to conceal their criminal activities. The group advocated for increased voter access, but there was no proof that Crist worked with ACORN on his plan to restore voting rights to felons, so we rated that claim False.)\nIn both instances, Rubio clearly sounded like he was criticizing Crist. It\u2019s not a big leap to think that he is personally against allowing felons to regain their right to vote, but his words fall short of making that clear.\nThe issue of restoring voting rights to certain felons has come up in the U.S. Senate the past two years but it hasn\u2019t received a vote, so we don\u2019t know Rubio\u2019s position on it. The Civil Rights Voting Restoration Act of 2015 would allow citizens to vote in any federal election even if they had been convicted of a non-violent criminal offense unless the individual was in jail or on probation.\nThe bipartisan duo of Sen. Rand Paul, a Republican presidential candidate from Kentucky, and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, are the measure\u2019s co-sponsors. Last year, Paul co-sponsored a similar bill with U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson, D-Florida. Paul, who has made efforts to court black voters, has said that stripping voting rights from felons is a form of voter suppression and has disproportionately harmed black voters.\nFelons and gun ownership\nUnder federal law, individuals with felony convictions lose their right to own guns, but states can restore these rights, a 2011 New York Times investigation found. In some states, felons can only regain their right to bear arms if they are pardoned, while others allow certain felons to regain their rights after five to 20 years. In Florida, felons are eligible to apply eight years after the completion of their sentence.\nBut we could not find any statements in which Rubio directly talked about whether convicted felons should be able to regain their right to own a gun.\nOur ruling\nA Facebook meme says Rubio said that \"felons should not have their voting rights restored\" but that \"convicted felons should be allowed to own guns after they have done their time.\"\nThe meme was posted by a site that describes itself as satirical, and we found no evidence that Rubio actually said the words attributed to him. While Rubio has spoken critically in the past about felons regaining voting rights, he does not appear to have taken a stance on the restoration of felons\u2019 gun rights.\nRubio didn\u2019t say these words, so we rate the claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06379"}
