So people who are falling behind in third grade are more likely to end up in our criminal justice system, and we have to address that challenge.\"\nIt follows that students who don\u2019t do well in school might face fewer opportunities and be more likely to struggle in other areas of life. But do states really use the academic performance of eight-year-olds to calculate how many people are likely to end up in prison years down the road?\nIn 2013, a mayoral candidate in Florida earned a Pants on Fire! rating from PolitiFact for making a similar claim that invoked private prison operators. And other variations of it have been repeatedly debunked over the years.\nThat hasn\u2019t stopped a long list of educators, writers and political leaders from repeating it, however. So we decided to vet Preckwinkle\u2019s claim to see if anything had changed in the years since PolitiFact last took up the case. The short answer: No.\n\u2018An urban legend that refuses to die'\nPreckwinkle\u2019s campaign didn't respond to our repeated calls and emails, so we don\u2019t know what source she was relying on when she made her claim, or even whether she meant the practice was applied only in specific states or in every state across the nation.\nBut a historical review of the talking point \u2014 which varies somewhat in each retelling but almost always focuses on third-grade scores \u2014 shows it\u2019s never held up to scrutiny.\nPeter Leone, a University of Maryland education professor who specializes in behavioral disorders and school discipline, told us he has seen no evidence any state uses student scores in the way Preckwinkle described.\n\"This is an urban legend that refuses to die,\" he wrote in an email.\nLeone directed the National Center on Education, Disability and Juvenile Justice, which during its operation from 1999 to 2006 produced a report noting that \"at least one state\" used third-grade reading scores to project future prison bed needs. Others have cited that report as backup for the claim, but Leone set the record straight years ago.\nHe explained to PolitiFact Florida in 2013 that detail was included in the report by a colleague \"before he got the facts.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 2013 fact-check also highlighted a 1999 Education Week article that included the claim, but the independent education consultant who wrote it told PolitiFact Florida he couldn\u2019t corroborate it and no longer repeats it. The author of a book that used the talking point gave a similar response.\nYears before PolitiFact Florida weighed in, FactCheck.org, the Washington Post and the Oregonian also debunked versions of the claim. A quick Google search also led us to a 2016 fact-check from WRAL.com in North Carolina. Once again, it was deemed baseless.\nWe wanted to make sure Preckwinkle\u2019s own state \u2014 and presumably the only one in which a Chicago mayor might exert some level of control \u2014 was no exception, however. So we checked with the Illinois Department of Corrections.\n\"I do not consider third-grade reading, or other grade school achievement levels when developing projections,\" the department's research manager, Sharon Shipinksi, told us in an email.\nInstead, IDOC estimates the size of future prison populations based on factors such as trends in the number of people admitted in previous years and the anticipated impact of policy changes designed to shorten sentences, reduce recidivism and more.\nLinking education and incarceration\nThere is a connection between academic failure and crime, however, which may be why this inaccurate talking point has enjoyed such a long shelf life.\nSome studies show a correlation between elementary school reading proficiency and high school graduation. Others reveal a correlation between high school dropout rates and incarceration.\nA 2010 Chicago study found students who read below grade level as third graders were much less likely to graduate high school within five years and attend college than better-performing students. Similarly, a 2012 study showed that one in six children who couldn\u2019t read proficiently by the end of third grade didn\u2019t graduate high school on time, a rate four times greater than that of their proficient peers.\nAnd a 2009 study from Northeastern University found that nearly one out of every 10 young men without a high school degree was incarcerated between 2006 and 2007, compared with one out of 33 high school graduates.\nWhile that\u2019s not a direct correlation between education and incarceration, it strongly suggests a link.\nOur ruling\nPreckwinkle said, \"Nationally, they predict prison populations on the basis of third-grade achievement.\"\nThat\u2019s a riff on a well-worn and startling urban legend that has been debunked repeatedly by PolitiFact and other news outlets over the years. It\u2019s not true in Illinois and we could find no credible evidence that suggested it was true elsewhere.\nWe rate it False.\n\nFALSE\u00a0\u2014 The statement is not accurate.\nClick here\u00a0for more\u00a0on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00858"}
