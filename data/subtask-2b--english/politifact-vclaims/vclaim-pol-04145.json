He says: \"Because Gallego is the insider\u2019s insider. Career politician. Went and lobbied after you fired him from Congress.\"\nFair enough on the politician part; Gallego, a lawyer, was a Texas House member for more than 20 years before winning election to Congress in 2012. Two years later, though, he lost re-election to Republican Will Hurd of Helotes, who\u2019s now trying to win his second term.\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee ad shows Gallego smiling as he strolls what looks like a major Washington, D.C. avenue. Text simultaneously flashes: \"Career politician,\" then \"Gallego lobbied\" with these words in smaller type at the bottom of the screen: \"City of Austin, 2015.\"\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/505c2984-7393-475b-aac6-534c66d2f87d\n\nSOURCE: Screen grab, TV advertisement, \"She\u2019s a Fan,\" National Republican Congressional Committee, YouTube, Oct. 4, 2016\nGallego might be in legal trouble if he went to lobby right away on Washington\u2019s infamous K Street where lobbying firms marshal forces. A 2007 law bars former House members from lobbying Congress for a year after leaving the body.\nThen again, news reports including a July 2016 Politico story suggest that despite the \"cooling off\" mandate, former senators and House members continue to enjoy lucrative careers trying to influence lawmakers. As of October 2016, too, the Center for Responsive Politics indicated that 49 percent of the former members of the 113th Congress, which was in session through 2014, had already gone to work for lobbying firms.\nIts list, though, didn\u2019t link Gallego to any firm.\nAnd asked to share the basis of the lobbyist claim, NRCC spokesman Zach Hunter, who confirmed the ad video showed Gallego strolling in Washington, pointed out Gallego\u2019s August 2015 federal personal financial disclosure indicating he was paid $55,000 that year to work for Austin\u2019s city government. Hunter also emailed us 10 documents that appeared to come from Gallego\u2019s city employee personnel file.\nCity officials: Gallego didn't lobby\nWe confirmed the authenticity of the city-connected documents by asking a city spokesman, David Green, for the public portions of Gallego\u2019s employee personnel file. Those documents indicate Gallego was employed in \"government relations\" for 40 hours a week from March 2, 2015, through Aug. 21, 2015, at an hourly rate of $56.26. At our inquiry, Green also shared the financial calculations that bear out the city ultimately paying Gallego $55,359.\nFor part of that time, through June 1, 2015, the Texas Legislature was in session. So, might it be that Gallego proved helpful to the city by lobbying legislators?\nTo the contrary, Green and a former Gallego superviser each told us Gallego had been hired not to lobby legislators but to advise the city on legislative and legal matters. Gallego, Green said by email, \"advised the government relations officer on policy and legislation and assisted in document preparation and strategy.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 23, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBiden invested the entire family fortune in Ukraine gas and oil.

Starting to get the picture.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreen told us John Hrncir, then the government relations officer, was one of Gallego\u2019s supervisors.\nWhen we called Hrncir, who retired in May 2015, he said he\u2019d recommended that the city consider adding Gallego to its government relations team after Hugh Brady left city government to work in President Barack Obama\u2019s administration.\nAccording to Brady\u2019s entry on LinkedIn.com, he was a special assistant city attorney and legislative counsel to the city until March 2014 when he became general counsel in the executive office of the president. In his city role, Brady\u2019s entry says, he advised city officials and drafted \"state and federal legislative instruments involving taxes, land use, water, government finance, regulatory authority, redistricting, collective bargaining, pensions and telecommunications.\"\nBy email, Hrncir wrote that \"in a typical legislative session the city is potentially impacted by 25% or more of the bills considered. The city usually has to pay attention to the 1,200 to 2,000 bills impacting it the most of the five to seven thousand filed. Deciding which legislative provisions to amend, pass, or defeat, and the time and effort to spend on each action, is a constant process, and decisions are revised, sometimes hourly, until the final gavel at sine die.\u00a0\n\"Pete Gallego is an experienced former (legislator) who had demonstrated exceptional ability at solving problems by finding solutions palatable to multiple factions of legislators--both parties; rural and urban reps; business and environmental advocates; etc. The constant triage for bills and amendments is critical to the city's success and I was confident that Gallego's advice to the team would be invaluable in maximizing the city's resources.\"\nGallego responds\nIn gauging this claim, we also queried Gallego\u2019s campaign.\nBy email, spokeswoman Lyndsey Rodriguez said the implication that Gallego was a Washington lobbyist doesn\u2019t hold up.\nGallego, Rodriguez said, was a temporary in-house employee of the City of Austin for approximately a six-month period of time\" and not among the city\u2019s outside paid lobbyists, she wrote, noting that he also didn\u2019t register as a lobbyist with the Texas Ethics Commission, which we confirmed from records listing outside lobbyists paid by the city to lobby in 2015.\nGallego, Rodriguez wrote, \"reported directly to the city attorney and provided the city attorney with opinions on legislative language and process. Pete also reviewed legislation, during and after session, to determine its impact on the city.\"\nFollowing up, we asked if Gallego in 2015 testified before a legislative committee or perhaps registered a position on behalf of the city; those are the kinds of duties often fulfilled by a lobbyist. \"He did not,\" Rodriguez replied.\nWe also reached Brian Yarbrough, among outside lobbyists paid by the city, who told us by phone he wasn't aware of Gallego directly lobbying for the city that year and didn't recall even seeing him in the Texas Capitol.\nOur ruling\nThe pro-Hurd Republican group says Gallego \"went and lobbied after you fired him from Congress.\"\nFor half of 2015 including three months of the legislative session, Gallego worked in government relations for Austin\u2019s city government. But the NRCC didn\u2019t provide nor did we find evidence he was working as a lobbyist--either in Austin or Washington, which the ad arguably implies.\nWe rate this claim False.\n\nFALSE \u2013 The statement is not accurate.
