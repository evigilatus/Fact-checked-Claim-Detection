Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 23, 2020 \nWe\u2019ll look at his statement on mortality in a separate fact-check. In this article we\u2019ll focus on his mistaken connection between increased testing and increased cases.\nWhile the number of coronavirus tests being conducted is rising over time, the positivity rate \u2014 which is the percentage of tests that come up positive for the virus \u2014 has also been rising since early June. And that undermines Trump\u2019s argument.\n\nThe following chart shows that the number of tests across the country has risen steadily since late March. The orange line shows how the positivity rate has changed over time.\n\n\u00a0\nInitially, the rise in tests did show the pattern Trump touted: As more tests were conducted, the percentage of positive results declined. After peaking above 20% positive in early April, the positivity rate fell to about 4% in early June.\u00a0\nA likely reason for this pattern is that early in the pandemic, tests were scarce and were reserved for people who showed visible symptoms. As testing kits became more widely accessible for people without obvious symptoms, a wider cross-section of the population was tested, with a resulting decline in tests showing the patient was infected.\nThe problem for Trump\u2019s assertion is that the decline in the positive rate reversed itself in early June.\nThe positivity rate bottomed out around June 10 at about 4.3%. By June 22, it had risen to about 5.3%.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat may not sound like a big increase, but if more infections are being tallied simply because more tests are being given, as Trump suggested, the positivity rate should be going down, or at least staying about the same, not rising.\n\"The up-turn in positive rate is sufficient to debunk\" what Trump said about testing, \"particularly given that the total number tests conducted is at its highest yet, and still we see an increase in the seven-day rolling positive rate,\" said Brooke Nichols, an infectious disease modeler at the Boston University School of Public Health.\nThe rise in the positivity rate appears to be driven by a handful of states.\nEarly coronavirus hot spots, notably New York, have seen a decline in new infections despite widespread testing. But other states are seeing both an increase in infections and an increase in the percentage of positive tests.\nIn Arizona, Florida, South Carolina, and Texas, the positivity rate has increased consistently since late May.\n\n\u00a0\nThe White House told PolitiFact that anecdotally, the increased testing has uncovered a growing number of people who are asymptomatic or who have mild or moderate cases than earlier in the pandemic, when tests were hard to get.\u00a0\nHowever, an increase in the number of infections also means the potential for accelerated spread.\nOur ruling\nTrump said that the coronavirus case count is \"up only because of our big number testing.\"\nTesting has increased nationally, but epidemiologists say that if this were the only reason that new cases were rising, the percentage of positive tests should be dropping or at least remaining about the same.\nThat pattern did occur from early April to early June, a period when the availability of testing expanded significantly. However, that\u2019s no longer the case. Since early June, the amount of testing being conducted has continued to reach new highs, yet the positivity rate has risen by a full percentage point.\nWe rate the statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17982"}
