Note that \"about 13 states and a handful of cities across the country have gone forward and done so without Congress.\" \"When you hear people say, well, if you raise the minimum wage that would be the lowest job -- it turns out that states that raised the minimum wage grew faster in jobs than states that did not raise the minimum wage,\" he added. We wondered whether Obama was right. The White House has told us that they refer to seasonally adapted growth of non-agricultural jobs since December 2013. We therefore checked the figures for employment data at the State level, which are collected by the Labour Statistics Office. The comparison included nine states that automatically increased their minimum wage early in the year to keep pace with inflation (Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Missouri, Montana, Ohio, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington) as well as four other states that enacted new wage raising laws (Conetcot, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island). The other side consisted of 37 states that did not promote the minimum wage at all. We calculated the differences between wage-raising and non-wage-raising states in two ways. The first is simply average job growth rates in all states in each category, with each state weighting equally. The second objective was to determine the common increase in jobs for all states in a given category; this second method already places greater weight on what is happening in States with the largest population. Using the first method, we found that the growth of jobs over the eight-month period averaged 1.074 per cent for each state in the higher-paid states, compared with 0.871 per cent for each state in the less-paid states. This provides support for Obama's allegations, although it's a very small difference -- just 20 out of 1%. Using the second method -- the way that gives more weight to high-density states -- we found that job growth over the eight-month period averaged 1.092 per cent in the higher-wage states, compared with 1.090 per cent in the less-paid states. This is a higher growth rate in jobs in states with minimum wages -- but with a narrow margin of approximately 2/1,000 per cent. Obama therefore has little numerical support to claim that growth rates during that period are higher in the states that have raised their pay. But as the support goes, the economists we met said it was a very thin reed. And here's why this measure of difference doesn't mean much. \u2022 Employment figures are \"annoying.\" That means they tend to move a lot. Therefore, economists caution against too much reading to upward or downward movements in these figures; they may simply be random mutations. On January 16, 2021, Jordan Rachel stated in Tweedda that the minimum wage of $15 per hour would raise the price of taco bill burrito to $38. \u2022 January 20, 2012, one way to explain this is to use a slightly different time frame. We decided to do the numbers in the same way, but we started working an hour after one month, breaking the data from January 2014 to August 2014. If you do this shift for one month, the advantage of creating jobs between states raises wages simply disappears. The difference in job growth \"can only be a random opportunity,\" said Andrew G. Biggs, a resident of the conservative American Enterprise Institute. \u2022 The raw data we use include the margins of error. The relevant point is that BLS function numbers may look accurate on the surface, but the agency cautions that they are best rounded -- there's a margin of error that has to be taken into account with each number. For the State as a whole, the monthly employment figures have an error margin of about 90,000 - that is, if the number of jobs at the national level is reported to grow by 100,000, the actual amount is likely to be between 10,000 and 190,000. The widely reported figure of 90,000 is simply the best guess within this range, and not at all. Each state has its own margin of error. This degree of uncertainty becomes particularly important when Obama relies on such small differences to clarify his view of the impact of the minimum wage on job growth. When it is argued that the difference between twenty points of a percentage point is sufficient to suspend a point of dialogue - well below 2,000 percentage points - it is important to remember that the difference is very small and is likely to be within the margins of the error. \u2022 Eight months is a short period for drawing conclusions. \"I will never draw any conclusion on the effects of employment given the marked change in employment in only the first six or eight months after his age, a period,\" said Gary Bertellis, a senior colleague at the Brookings Institution. \"I would be surprised to see that the impact on this short period of time can provide a valid indicator of the impact of minimum wage increases on employment. It takes more time, and it needs some sort of primitive control of economic trends in the states that preceded the rise in wages.\" The White House reported that there had been a precedent in studying this question for eight months, referring to the study widely cited in 1994 on the minimum wage. More broadly, the White House portrays Obama's comment not as an announcement that increases in minimum wages cause faster job growth, but as a reaction to critics who claim that increases in minimum wages inevitably impede employment creation. This is a more defensible point, and it is true that Obama has already claimed: \"When you hear people say, well, if you raise the minimum wage that will be the lowest job.\" However, Obama goes on to say that raising the minimum wage actually says, \"The growth in jobs was faster\" -- a statement stronger than simply saying that raising the minimum wage would not harm job growth. Obama may not have meant this, but it is reasonable that the listener of Princeton, Ind, is a speech in which the President believes that raising the minimum wage leads to faster job growth, and then wonders if this is true. Our Governor Obama said \"States that raised the minimum wage were faster to grow jobs than states that did not raise the minimum wage.\" The White House has told us that they refer to seasonally adapted growth of non-agricultural jobs since December 2013. On the numbers, Obama has a point of view -- at least when using the specific time frame he has chosen. But economists say that the numbers are extremely disturbing, and the margins of error are too large, and the time frame may be too short to be sure that we are seeing the effect of a higher minimum wage. The statement is partially accurate, but it ignores important details or takes things out of context, so we evaluate it half right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07172"}
