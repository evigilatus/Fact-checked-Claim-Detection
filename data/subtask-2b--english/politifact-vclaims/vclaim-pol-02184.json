Secretary General Ban Ki-moon\u2019s term expires in early 2017, making Obama\u2019s bid for the position a possibility.\" Ban, the UN\u2019s eighth secretary-general, ended his term Dec. 31, 2016.\nThe claim that Obama sought to or intended to become the UN\u2019s secretary-general has been around for several years.\nUSA NEWS\u2019 post includes several sentences that first appeared in a Jan. 8, 2016, post on the Washington Times.

The Arab media is addicted to such tales. But Mr. Obama was once described by Bill Clinton as a fairy tale, too, and here he is, completing his second term, and Mr. Obama does not suffer excessive modesty.\"\nIn January 2016, Israeli media also reported on the Kuwaiti newspaper\u2019s claim, but not without casting doubt on the information. \"The report, which admittedly appears somewhat far-fetched, has not been confirmed by any other news outlets and does not name any of its sources,\" israelnationalnews.com reported.\nThe UN General Assembly appoints its secretary-general, on the recommendation of the Security Council.
