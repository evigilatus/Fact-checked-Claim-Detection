And as education secretary in the Trump administration, she has championed lower Education Department budgets and proposed increasing federal funding to support private school enrollment. Members of the DeVos family have contributed $800,000 to a Super PAC trying to unseat incumbent Democratic Sen. Gary Peters.\nJames, a Detroit-area businessman, has noted his support for DeVos and for school choice. But he hasn\u2019t outlined a particular approach.\nThose who advocate for helping parents access alternatives to traditional public schools offer an array of proposals, from supporting charter schools, to government-funded vouchers to cover private school tuition costs, to tax credits that fund scholarships to help students attend private schools.\nWhile the ad suggests James backs the DeVos agenda, James has not specifically said whether he approves of her efforts to significantly cut funding for public education and increase federal support for private schools. He has not held elective office, or taken any public votes that would clarify his position. His campaign speeches and website lay out few specific policy positions, a fact that his critics have pointed out. And his campaign declined PolitiFact Michigan\u2019s request for any details about his education policies that would rebut the PAC\u2019s claim.\nThat said, the Senate Majority PAC did not provide any clear evidence to back its claim that James supported DeVos\u2019s \"agenda to cut public school funding and put it into wealthy private schools instead.\"\nThe PAC said it\u2019s reasonable to conclude that based on his comments, James is fully behind DeVos\u2019 policies. \"James is very on the record about supporting her, and she\u2019s very on the record about her positions,\" Matt Corridoni from Senate Majority PAC wrote in an email to PolitiFact Michigan.\n\"Not being in office doesn\u2019t excuse him from not taking a specific position on the policy itself \u2014 he\u2019s a candidate who has embraced a platform,\" Corridoni added.\nDuring his unsuccessful 2018 campaign to unseat Michigan\u2019s Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow, James highlighted the need for education reform to address underperforming schools in Michigan.\nEducation is listed among the policy priorities featured on James\u2019 current campaign website, on which he calls for supporting \"all education options\u2014public, charter, and private.\" While James supports school choice, he has not made clear whether his vision for education reform includes cutting funding for public schools and providing increased federal support for private schools.\nDeVos\u2019 record on directing funding to private schools\nAnalyses by the nonpartisan Committee for Education Funding finds that during DeVos\u2019 tenure as Education Secretary, she has consistently proposed slashing funding for public education and deploying federal dollars to expand school choice, including increasing federal support for private schools. Private schools do not receive federal funding directly. Instead the Education Department provides funding for school districts that fund services to students at private schools.\nThe Trump administration\u2019s budget requests have proposed reducing the Education Department\u2019s spending, but increasing federal support for private schools through appropriations, a tax credit to fund scholarships to attend private schools and voucher programs that could be used for private schools.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring a 2018 House Appropriations subcommittee hearing, DeVos defended the cuts proposed in the administration\u2019s budget that year. \"President Trump is committed to reducing the federal footprint in education, and that is reflected in this budget,\" she said.\nBut the administration\u2019s proposals have faced stiff pushback from Democratic and Republican lawmakers. Congress has consistently rejected cuts to the Education Department budget, and none of the Trump administration\u2019s requests for\u00a0 more federal support for private schools have been enacted. Trump has signed the spending bills into law anyway.\nThis past spring, DeVos directed school districts to share federal funding from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act with private schools. Analysis from the nonpartisan Learning Policy Institute found that the school districts would direct an additional $1.3 billion to private schools under the department\u2019s guidance. A federal judge ruled Sept. 4 that the department did not have the authority to do this, and the rule is no longer in effect.\nJames\u2019 statements of support for DeVos\n\"She\u2019s headed in the right direction,\" James said of DeVos during his\u00a02018 campaign,\u00a0according to audio from a May 2018 campaign fundraiser shared with PolitiFact Michigan by Senate Majority PAC.\n\"By doing things to get more power back to the states and to parents, I truly believe that if we give parents the resources and the opportunity to decide what\u2019s best for their children, they will make the best decision 100% of the time,\" James said.\nA few months later, James reiterated his support for DeVos and alternatives to traditional public schools. \"I think that the job Betsy DeVos is doing in the Department of Education I think is very, very good,\" according to audio from a fundraiser shared by the Democratic PAC. James also said, \"I totally support charter schools,\" according to a transcript of the recording provided by the Senate Majority PAC.\nJames\u2019 2018 comments followed DeVos\u2019 effort to cut funding for the Education Department that year and increase federal support for private schools, including a proposal for a $1 billion grant to fund school choice initiatives, in part through\u00a0 scholarships to private schools. And in 2017, the Trump administration proposed spending $250 million to provide families with vouchers to use at private schools.\nWhile James has noted his support for DeVos and school choice, the Democratic PAC did not provide evidence that James specifically supports cutting funding for public schools and diverting that money to help parents send their children to private schools instead.\nOur ruling\nThe Senate Majority PAC claimed in a Facebook ad that James \"supported Betsy DeVos\u2019 agenda to cut public school funding and put it into wealthy private schools instead.\"\nDuring her tenure as education secretary, DeVos has sought funding cuts to public schools while increasing federal funding to help more children enroll in private schools.\nJames has made comments supportive of DeVos\u2019 school choice efforts broadly, but his campaign declined to offer details on his education policy proposals, and he has no legislative voting record to indicate where he stands.\nIt may seem like James is benefiting from the lack of information he and his campaign have provided on his education platform. Nonetheless, the PAC did not provide conclusive evidence for its claim that he favors directing federal funding away from public schools to supporting private schools.\nThe statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate this claim Mostly False.\u00a0\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections FactChat #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click\u00a0here\u00a0for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19007"}
