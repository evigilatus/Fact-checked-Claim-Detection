That\u2019s a made-up story resurfacing on social media.\nAn obscure website called Phoenix Post published a story Aug. 14 headlined, \"VIDEO Kevin Bacon Saying \u2018We Are Blessed To Have Donald Trump As Our President\u2019.\"\nBut there\u2019s no video of Bacon saying that. This story was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe false story has been around for months on other websites. Bacon in December 2017 tweeted a link to a Gossip Cop story debunking the narrative. \"Wow. Thanks for clearing this up,\" Bacon wrote in the tweet.\nWow.
