Lloyd Doggett recently laid out his case for renewing \"emergency\" extended unemployment insurance for another year.\n\nIn a Dec. 8, 2011, opinion piece on the Huffington Post website, the Austin Democrat quoted a little \"Workin\u2019 Man\" from the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band and then listed bold-faced \"Facts\" including, \"Fact: One economist estimates that for every $1 we spent on unemployment insurance benefits, we get $1.61 in economic activity back.\"\n\nThat rang a bell. We were already checking a nearly identical statement on a Web page posted by the Democrats of the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee, and we\u2019d found that another PolitiFact writer checked a similar claim in 2010.\n\nWere they all the same? Basically, yes, Doggett spokeswoman Sarah Dohl told us: All three statements relied on a single estimate from Moody\u2019s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi.\n\nThe factoid was used, then as now, as an argument for extending the federal Emergency Unemployment Compensation program, created in 2008 and originally set to expire in a year. It\u2019s been extended eight times, and the current law providing support for up to 99 weeks expires Jan. 3, 2012. If it isn\u2019t extended, most people who lose their jobs after that will get a maximum 26 weeks of state unemployment benefits.\n\nDuring a July 2010 Congressional standoff over renewing the benefits, PolitiFact rated U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen\u2019s version of the statement Half True. She got Zandi\u2019s number about right, PolitiFact observed, but other experts disputed the economist\u2019s results.\n\nDohl told us the $1.61 estimate came from Zandi\u2019s testimony to the House budget committee on July 1, 2010.\n\nNext, we checked with Zandi to see if his $1.61 number still held. He told us that he updates such numbers every quarter and that his most recent figure, for the second quarter of 2011, is $1.55.\n\nWhy the decrease? Zandi said new data are confirming suspicions that extending unemployment benefits means some workers just stay unemployed longer. \"If they are not working, then less is produced and the economy is smaller,\" he said.\n\nThis \"disincentive\" effect includes some fraud, Zandi pointed out. But it isn\u2019t always dishonest -- sometimes the worker uses the time to find a better job, and if that worker is an unemployed rocket scientist who could earn $125,000 a year, it\u2019s much better for the economy if he or she is earning and spending that cash instead of living on the minimum wage.\n\nWe also asked Zandi how he generates such estimates in the first place. How might handing $1 to an unemployed worker make the nation\u2019s gross domestic product eventually increase by $1.55?\n\nThe basic idea is that Uncle Sam hands an unemployed person $1, and that person buys, perhaps, groceries with it; the grocery owner in turn will need to order more vegetables, and the dollar continues to change hands, losing a few cents in some transactions, perhaps gaining in others. Some value leaches away into transaction costs, taxes or savings; but the dollar can generate growth, too -- for example, if the grocery store owner has to hire more staff.\n\nZandi said he uses a complex econometric model with hundreds of equations to determine whether a dollar spent on unemployment compensation drives the GDP up or down and how much. Essentially, he told us, you take a certain period of time, figure out how much was spent on unemployment insurance and how much GDP went up, and try to hold all the other factors equal.\n\nHe also produces estimates on how much bang for the buck the U.S. government gets from many other spending options. That\u2019s part of what he was telling the House committee: which policy options he believes can boost the economy most.\n\nA few examples from Zandi\u2019s Aug. 26, 2011 report on the economy:\n\n\u2022 Spending $1 on unemployment insurance boosts GDP by $1.55.\n\n\u2022 Cutting corporate tax rates $1 will boost GDP by 32 cents.\n\n\u2022 Cutting taxes $1 across the board will boost GDP by 98 cents.\n\n\u2022 Spending $1 to increase food stamps temporarily will boost GDP by $1.71.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn its most ridiculously oversimplified form, the equation to get that first number could be written as $1 times X equals $1.55. \"X\" is the multiplier -- and if the multiplier is larger than 1, your money goes up. If the multiplier is less than 1, your money goes down.\n\nSo in this chart, Zandi\u2019s stating that the multiplier for corporate tax rate cuts was 0.32; the multiplier for across-the-board tax cuts was 0.98; and the multiplier for increasing food stamps was 1.71.\n\nDoggett\u2019s spokeswoman had also sent us a study, commissioned by the U.S. Department of Labor and others, that used Moody\u2019s models (and some of Zandi\u2019s work) to conclude that during the recession that began in 2008, every dollar spent on unemployment insurance boosted the gross domestic product $2.\n\nDifferent results are generated by different time periods, different equations and different data sets, as with the Labor study, but Zandi said the main thing to note here is that each multiplier is not a fixed point. \"The multipliers depend on the state of the economy. If the economy is operating full-out, then the multiplier will be low and could even be negative. \u00a0If the economy is very weak, then the multiplier will be large,\" he told us.\n\nBut herein lies the foundation for one objection to Zandi\u2019s models: Some economists believe it\u2019s not realistic to predict any GDP increase.\n\nHarvard economist Robert Barro is prominent among them, writing Aug. 24, 2011 in the Wall Street Journal that \"this idea \u2014 that one can magically get back more than one puts in \u2014 conflicts with what I will call \u2018regular economics.\u2019\"\n\nSo there\u2019s one fundamental objection. PolitiFact reported more concerns last year, including:\n\n\u2022 An economist from the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute cited a survey of 10 scholars\u2019 research -- using different methods -- indicating that $1 spent in tax cuts might increase GDP, but $1 in increased government spending would decrease GDP. That is, for tax cuts the multiplier is above 1, but for government spending the multiplier is below 1.\n\n\u2022 Some researchers say unemployment spending will drag the economy down long-term, because the government will eventually have to raise taxes in order to keep paying out.\n\n\u2022 Scholars from the conservative Heritage Foundation said it\u2019s invalid to assume the unemployed person will rush out and spend the whole dollar.\n\nZandi agreed that if the unemployment benefits are \"financed by a larger deficit, then it will result in weaker long-term growth.\" But, he said, if it \"helps avoid a more severe downturn in the economy now, then it could very well be worth the long-term cost.\"\n\nAs to spending the whole dollar, Zandi said his view remains that \"most unemployed workers will spend their unemployment insurance very soon after they receive it.\" If you give a dollar to Bill Gates, he said, the billionaire might not spend it at once, but \"many people are living paycheck to paycheck, not thinking 10 years down the road.\"\n\nSo, clearly, economists diverge on whether, and how much, spending on unemployment benefits might boost the economy.\n\nFor more perspective, PolitiFact looked at estimates from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. In January 2010, the CBO estimated a dollar in unemployment aid would increase GDP between $0.70 to $1.90 -- so Shaheen\u2019s $1.60 was at the high end, but still in the ballpark.\n\nA Nov. 15, 2011, CBO update says that a dollar in unemployment aid would increase the GDP between $0.40 to $1.90. Zandi\u2019s latest estimate of a $1.55 increase in GDP falls toward the high end of that range.\n\nBut that\u2019s not the amount Doggett cited. He\u2019s repeating $1.61, which makes the outcome look rosier than it might really be -- even setting aside other economists\u2019 concerns with making such a projection.\n\nOur ruling\n\nDoggett cites an economist\u2019s projection that the country gets a 61 percent return on each additional dollar in unemployment aid. But his \"fact\" overlooks another fact: Economists are divided over whether unemployment aid increases GDP. \u00a0Also, Doggett\u2019s statement specifies a figure from mid-2010 that\u2019s been out of date for about a year. A failure to update it is like failing to update the national employment rates.\n\nThe only certain fact here is that an economist did once estimate $1.61.\n\nOur sense is you can\u2019t take Doggett\u2019s statement to the bank.
