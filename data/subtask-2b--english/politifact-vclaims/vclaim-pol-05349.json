Marco Rubio that Trump is a con man. Rubio's recent attacks have focused on\u00a0allegations of false marketing by Trump University.\nIt wasn\u2019t a real university -- and had to change its name to Trump Entrepreneur Institute because of that. It was largely a seminar program that promised to teach its students the real estate secrets that turned Trump into a billionaire. With some participants paying as much as $35,000, the project drew investigations and lawsuits in at least three states.\nThe university registered as a private company in New York in October 2004 and largely shut down by 2011. When NBC host Chuck Todd raised issues with the university, Trump defended the program, noting that nearly all the students thought it was \"great.\"\n\"They signed these documents saying, they rated the course, 98 percent approval rating and high marks,\" Trump said on\u00a0Meet the Press\u00a0on\u00a0Feb. 28, 2016. And he added, \"We have an A from the Better Business Bureau.\"\nHELP US RAISE $15,000 TO HIRE AN EXTRA\u00a0FACT-CHECKER\nWe went to the\u00a0Better Business Bureau\u00a0website and saw that as of today, the Trump Entrepreneur Institute has no rating. The website explained, \"This business has no rating because BBB has information indicating it is out of business.\"\nTrump spokeswoman Hope Hicks told us, \"When the school was operational it was rated A.\"\nWe asked Hicks to document that rating and didn\u2019t hear back.\nKatherine Hutt, director of communications for the Council of Better Business Bureaus, said that as a matter of policy, they don\u2019t provide any ratings from previous years. But the organization issued a statement that \"Over the years, the company\u2019s BBB\u00a0rating has fluctuated between an A+ and a D-.\"\nWe don\u2019t know when the bureau might have given Trump University a top grade,\u00a0but based on the\u00a0Internet Archive, the last time the Better Business Bureau gave the university any rating at all was 2010, when it give it a D-minus. That assessment showed up in plenty of news articles.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat year, the\u00a0New York Daily News\u00a0reported that\u00a0\"the Better Business Bureau in January slapped a D-minus rating on Trump U., a rating now under review after Trump U. objected.\"\nCBS News said the same thing in an\u00a0April 21, 2010, article.\nAnd \u00a0in\u00a0May, 2011, the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0wrote \"The Better Business Bureau gave the school a D-minus for 2010, its second-lowest grade, after receiving 23 complaints.\"\nThe\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0had the same information in\u00a0May 2011\u00a0when it reported that the New York State Attorney General was investigating the Trump Entrepreneur Institute. The Attorney General\u2019s Office did file charges but stumbled on the grounds that\u00a0the statute of limitations had passed. \u00a0The matter is under appeal.\nUnder the new name Trump Entrepreneur Initiative, ratings ranged from C to B between 2012 and 2014. We found no ratings at all for the past two years.\nOur ruling\nTrump said about his entrepreneur institute that \"we have an \u2018A\u2019 from the Better Business Bureau.\" Literally speaking, that is inaccurate. The Better Business Bureau gives the program no rating today because it\u2019s no longer a going concern.\nTrump University had an A at some point. The Better Business Bureau doesn't\u00a0release details of its past ratings, but it did say Trump's program had ratings that ranged from A+ to D-.\nWhat we do know, from several published reports and archived Web pages, is that the university had a D in 2010\u00a0and under its new name, had ratings ranging from C to B, with no ratings after March 2014.\nTrump\u2019s claim is literally wrong and also ignores the university\u2019s lower Better Business Bureau scores. We rate it False.\nUpdate: This fact-check was updated on Feb. 29 to include information from the Internet Archive and on March 3 to add information about the\u00a0Trump Entrepreneur Initiative.\n Share the Facts   Politifact    5 7  Politifact Rating: False  \"We (Trump University) have an \u2018A\u2019 from the Better Business Bureau.\"    Donald Trump Presidential candidate   In an interview with NBC's Meet the Press Sunday, February 28, 2016 02/28/2016    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05349"}
