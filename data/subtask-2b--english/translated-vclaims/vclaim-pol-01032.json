This morning, the co-host of the centre, Norah O'Donnell, asked the 37-year-old boy what qualified him to become president. But Putrzej (publicized as BOOT-dge) referred to his government experience and added: \"I have more military experience than anyone who has been behind that office since George H.W. \"Bosch.\" As many readers already know, this is due to the comparison between Buttigig and Bush's eldest son, George W. Bush. Experience among former Presidents, as indicated by Buttig, late George H.W. Bush had a wide military background. He was a bomber in the US Navy during World War II, served from 1942 to 1945. A total of 58 combat missions have flown, dropped into the Pacific Ocean and obtained the outstanding flying cross. Since President Bush served in the White House, three of the successors of the Oval Office, Donald Trump Republican and Democratic Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, did not serve in the army. This leaves Bush's eldest son, George W. Bush, also the Republican, who was President from 2001 to 2009. The youngest Bush was the first lieutenant in the Texas National Air Guard from 1968 to 1973, during the Vietnam War. He was certified as a fighter pilot, but he only served in the United States, and he didn't see any fighting. On January 13, 2021, the distinguished fact-checkers stated in a story in which General David H. Berger, the commander of the United States Navy, said that Nancy Belusi's request to use the Marines to provide security, saying \"We are not working for you.\" By Samantha Buterman: January 17, 2021 Butage, is the Butage military experiment broader than George W. Bush's military experience? Yeah. The gay and married researcher Rhodes served longer on reserves and saw the actual duty. According to the official curriculum vitae of the mayor of Bothig, he served eight years, from 2009 to 2017, in the U.S. Navy Reserve. Speaking on behalf of his exploratory committee, she reminded us of the reflection of the first person to be written by Botigage for his hometown newspaper, south of Tribeon, about his wartime service. The article concerned his taking leave of absence as mayor in 2014 during his first term of office, when he was called into active service for six months as an intelligence officer against terrorism in Afghanistan. The article included a photo of Futgig in Kabul, wearing a bucket and a rifle tied on his back. The war in Afghanistan is now in its eighteenth year, as the New York Times noted in a summary. In 2014, the Pentagon declared an end to American combat operations. Since then, fewer troops have remained to train Afghan forces and carry out counter-terrorism operations against groups such as the Islamic State. The military service of Butgeg was also observed in a number of news articles, including the Washington Post, the Arginic.com and the New York Times (which said that his leave was unpaid). \"I have more military experience than anyone who's been behind that office since George H.W. \"Bosch.\" Of the four men who have served as President since Bush the Great, George W. Bush has served only in the army: five years alongside the Texas Air National Guard. Butteg spent eight years in the United States Marine Reserve, including six months deployed in time of war in Afghanistan, in 2014.
