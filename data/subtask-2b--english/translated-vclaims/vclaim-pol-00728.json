In an early morning tweet on April 23, Trump wrote: \"In the old days if you are president and your economy is good, you are basically safe from cash. Remember, \"It's a stupid economy.\" Today, as President, I have probably the greatest economy in history... and to the main media, it means nothing. But he will!\" In \"old days,\" if you're president and you have a good economy, you're basically safe from cash. Remember, \"The economy is stupid.\" Today, as President, I have probably the greatest economy in history... and the main media, it doesn't mean anything. But it will happen! Donald J. Trump@realDonaldTromp, April 23, 2019 we wondered if Trump was right. It was something Bill Clinton's presidential campaign team would say to remind themselves to keep the message. Short answer: Trump is wrong. In view of the approval estimates for beginners, we will note that \"criticism\" on the part of government leaders is inevitable in the light of the first amendment, which protects \"freedom of speech or of the press; or the right of the people to assemble peacefully, and to petition the Government to remedy grievances.\" Jeremy Surrey, a historian at the University of Texas and its Lyndon P. Johnson School of Public Affairs, said: \"The presidents were never 'given to criticism, regardless of economics'. \"From Washington to Trump, each president faced serious criticism from local opponents and various groups. This is American as apple pie.\" But even if you define the issue more broadly, Trump's statement lacks evidence. For a quick and dirty analysis, we have looked at two statistics that measure the strength of the economy and public support of each president after the Second World War: the unemployment rate, and an estimate of the President's approval by the Gallup polling firm. We found four presidents - Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon and George W. Bush - who experienced almost low unemployment rates such as Trump but whose approval rates ranged from low to high twenties to high thirties. Here's a summary: On 13 January, 2021 in a story, General David H. Berger, commander of the US Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for the use of Marines for security, saying, \"We're not working for you.\" What they all share is a major issue other than the economy that drains public support. \"If the President has a good economy, he gives them the opportunity to gain a good appreciation - but it is not a guarantee,\" said Jeffrey A. Angel, director of the South Methodist University Center for Presidential History. For Truman, Johnson and Bush, the war was unloved. For Nixon, it was Watergate. \"The war, when it is long, tends to be regressive for presidential approval,\" said Bert A. Rockman, an honorary professor of political science at Bordeaux University. \"All things are equal, a prosperous economy is helping the President, unless they are trapped in conflicts that produce large numbers of victims over a long period of time and which seem to be at an impasse.\" Johnson faced problems after the Vietnam War. \"I think he could have survived the war had it not been for riots and ethnic assassinations,\" said Angel. \"It wasn't just one thing. It was their number.\" Even presidents who maintain the degree of their consent are not safe from \"critical\" during good economic times, as Syria has said. Johnson and Bill Clinton said, \"They were presidents during two of the best economic periods in post-war history in the United States, but both faced intense criticism from Republicans and some Democrats.\" \"The Republics isolated Clinton at a moment of very low unemployment, strong economic growth and even budgetary surplus.\" (On the eve of his vote on impeachment in the House of Representatives, Clinton's approval rate was 63 per cent. Syria added that low unemployment rates do not ensure that everyone is happy with the economy. He said: \"There is also the question of who benefits from good economic numbers.\" \"The growth of inequality, despite low unemployment, has been a source of criticism for all presidents since at least Nixon.\" The White House did not respond to any inquiry. Our Governor Trump said, \"In the old days, if you were president and you had a good economy, you were basically safe from cash.\" Even if Trump revoked the constitutionally protected right of Americans to petition the Government for their grievances, he lacked the basic evidence to confirm it. There were at least four former presidents who served during good economic times, but the degree of approval was lower than the current Trump rates, usually because of war or scandal. We value the pants statement on the fire.
