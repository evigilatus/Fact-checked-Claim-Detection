President Barack Obama has made the projects a cornerstone of his transportation agenda. And outgoing Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle is hustling to get the Milwaukee-to-Madison train rolling.\n\nMeanwhile, Republican gubernatorial hopeful Scott Walker has vowed repeatedly to stop the project \u00a0\"dead in its tracks.\"\n\nThat\u2019s a strong statement.\n\nSo is this one from U.S. Transportation Secretary Raymond LaHood, who on two separate visits to Wisconsin flatly declared the train could not be stopped.\n\n\"It\u2019s coming,\" he said at a Labor Day rally in Milwaukee. \"Nobody can stop this train.\"\n\nLaHood\u2019s statement was not one of opinion, a promise for the future or a prediction on what is likely to happen. It was stated as fact.\n\nSo we wondered: Is it true none can stop the project?\n\nWe tried to talk to LaHood, a former Republican U.S. House member from Illinois, minutes after his Labor Day speech, but he declined to be interviewed. His office refused follow up interview requests.\n\nLike Walker, Republicans running for governor in several other states have declared their opposition to proposed high-speed rail lines.\n\nIn Ohio, John Kasich has vowed to block the \"3C\" train that would link Columbus, Cleveland and Cincinnati; In Florida, Rick Scott opposes service between Tampa and Orlando; and in California, Meg Whitman is against a San Francisco-Los Angeles line.\n\nFor his part, LaHood has called the rail projects an important economic development tool and is baffled by the opposition.\n\n\"We're talking about nothing short of transforming transportation much the same way the interstate highway system did under President Eisenhower,\" LaHood wrote on his blog Oct. 5, 2010, a day after a New York Times article looked at opposition to the projects. \"Can you imagine if Ohio or Wisconsin or any other state had said, \"No, thanks -- we don't think that highway thing is going anywhere?\"\n\nLet\u2019s start with a little background on the Wisconsin project.\n\nIn January, the state\u2019s application for an extension of Amtrak\u2019s Milwaukee-Chicago Hiawatha line won $810 million in federal funds. Plans call for service to reach 79 mph in 2013 and 110 mph by 2015 -- actually not a high speed train compared with \"bullet train\" service of up to 220 mph planned in other parts of the country.\n\nThe federal government agreed to pay the full cost of building the line, but the state would be required to spend an estimated $8 million a year to run it. The state agreed to buy two 14 car train sets from the Spanish company Talgo for $47 million. Those trains would be built at the former Tower Automotive site on Milwaukee\u2019s north side, creating an initial 125 jobs.\n\nDespite the opposition, and the uncertainty of who will win the Nov. 2 election, the Doyle administration in August announced plans to dramatically escalate spending on the train -- from about $50 million to $300 million in 2010 alone.\n\nBy the end of the year, the state will have spent or entered into contracts for nearly $300 million but won't necessarily have spent that much, according to Cari Ann Renlund, and aide to state Transportation Secretary Frank Busalacchi.\n\nThe breakdown: $52.4 million for design work on stations and the overall rail corridor, $140 million in contracts for work on building raised land bridges, and up to $100 million in contracts for steel and railroad ties.\n\nOf course, a new governor -- and new Legislature -- will take office in January. What could happen then?\n\nDOT\u2019s Renlund scheduled and canceled two interviews on the topic. Meanwhile, LaHood\u2019s press secretary Olivia Alair refused to discuss what could happen: \"We\u2019re not going to get into speculation about hypothetical scenarios.\"\n\nSo we turned to Walker and asked him how he plans to stop a speeding train.\n\nHe laid out several scenarios:\n\nTie the purse strings. Walker said he would refuse to authorize the annual state operational funding. \"If we don\u2019t appropriate that, they can\u2019t operate the train,\" he said, calling it \"the easiest, most direct approach.\"\n\nCancel the contracts already approved. This could prompt its own legal fight, including from companies who have signed contracts to build trains and supply materials. Walker downplayed that likelihood, arguing \"they\u2019re not going to completely alienate themselves\" from getting other state work by fighting too hard over the train.\n\nGo to court. Walker hinted he might seek an injunction against the train -- even before the election arguing the state shouldn\u2019t have sped up the work.\n\nWalker noted the Marquette Interchange was just rebuilt, in part, with federal money that had been set aside years ago for a light-rail system. A similar nothing-can-stop-this declaration back then would not have held much water.\n\nOutside experts agreed the train could be stopped, focusing on control by a Gov. Walker of the state Transportation Department. He would probably succeed in canceling the contract with the federal government, they said.\n\n\"I think he\u2019s got the power to say no,\" said Erich Zimmermann, senior policy analyst with Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonpartisan Washington D.C. watchdog group.\n\nSteven Polzin, director of mobility policy research at the Center for Urban Transportation Research, University of South Florida, Tampa, said that control of the state Transportation Department is probably the most powerful tool Walker would have.\n\n\"They could choose not to pursue that project,\" said Polzin.\n\nZimmermann noted there could be significant economic and political costs to the state if the contracts were cancelled. And Polzin, whose group has been criticized by some for favoring cars over rail, argues the projects have not been adequately studied before they were approved.\n\nAs for the $810 million, Walker said he would urge Congress to allow the state to use the money for other transportation purposes, such as roads. He noted if Republicans win the House, U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, would likely become chairman of the Budget Committee, and may look favorably on that. Of course, Obama would still be around with his veto pen.\n\nZimmermann and Polzin say the cash is likely to just go to rail projects in other states.\n\nOf course, all of this gets us well past election day and campaign pledges. By then, whoever is governor may face heavy pressure from business leaders with train-related contracts, labor unions and community leaders to keep the project -- and related jobs -- moving ahead.\n\nSo, let\u2019s bring this all back to the starting point.\n\nIn his enthusiastic support for the Milwaukee-to-Madison train, U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood has proclaimed -- twice -- that the train could not be stopped. That statement overlooks an obvious obstacle: the voters. If Walker wins, experts say he will have numerous avenues open to him to stop the project, even though those steps may carry repercussions. And if Congress turns red, he would have a major ally in the effort.\n\nWe rate LaHood\u2019s statement False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-14282"}
