The protester, activist and journalist Kathy Wray Coleman, had just finished speaking when she was handcuffed by police, allegedly for an outstanding warrant from University Heights.\n\u00a0\n\nThis doesn\u2019t look like a police \"stand-down\" to us.\nWe heard from\u00a0Cernovich just as we were publishing this fact-check. In an email, he suggested his story helped thwart the stand-down order from being enforced.\n\"I stand behind my story and am proud that efforts by (Ohio Gov. John Kasich)\u00a0and those friendly with him were stopped by my exclusive story regarding a stand down order,\"\u00a0Cernovich wrote. \"Local police are great and want to defend people. But many higher ups ... took the primary too personally.\"\nOur rating \nCernovich claimed on his blog and Twitter\u00a0that Cleveland Police have issued a \"stand down\"\u00a0order for the RNC.\nCleveland police vociferously proclaim this statement 100 percent false. The scene on the ground shows plenty of law enforcement doing their jobs.\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4cf751e2-fbbe-4e79-ab95-32b09245a0ed", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04678"}
