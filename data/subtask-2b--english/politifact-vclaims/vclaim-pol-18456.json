There\u2019s no truth to that, but it is interesting to see how one outfit raised suspicions.\nThe website Raw Story posted a story about newly released data on ballot delivery.\n\"One of the worst failures occurred in South Florida, where 27% of mail-in votes may have never been received,\" the Nov. 4 article said. \"But those statistics might not be telling the entire story. Vice News reported Tuesday that ballots were not being scanned for delivery in an effort to speed up the process.\"\nAnyone who read closely, or better still, went to the Vice News article, would be left with a very different impression. The Vice headline was \"Why the Post Office\u2019s Last-Minute Ballot Crisis Isn\u2019t as Dire as It Seems.\"\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nLet\u2019s unpack what\u2019s going on.\nThe 27% figure was derived based on a tweet from Hill reporter (and former PolitiFact reporter) John Kruzel. The tweet showed USPS data, and for the South Florida delivery area, the processing score for ballots was 74.43%.\u00a0\nA few people took that and, with a bit of sloppy math, came up with 27% undelivered.\nBut anyone reading the thread in the tweet would see that in order to speed up the delivery of ballots to election offices, the postal service had said that it didn\u2019t bother to scan ballots on their way out from the mail processing center.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL. Lin Wood\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in an interview with the Patriotically Correct Radio Show\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"China was behind the interference and the effort to overthrow our government and the election, election fraud.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Daniel Funke \u2022 January 19, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Many facilities have arranged for local turnaround,\" lawyers for the postal service affirmed wrote in a Nov. 3 filing.\n\"It\u2019s not that they weren\u2019t delivered,\" said National Association of Letter Carriers chief of staff Jim Sauber. \"They were pulled out directly from the rest of the mail and delivered the same day.\"\nWe contacted the election supervisor offices of two of the largest South Florida counties, Broward and Miami-Dade. The spokesman for Broward Steve Vancore said there were zero undelivered ballots.\n\"We went to all 42 post offices, the main postal collection center in Oakland Park and the regional center in Opa Locka in the days leading up to and on Election Day and retrieved all the ballots that were at those sites,\" Vancore said. \"We were at both the Aldridge and Opa Locka sites at 7:00 pm to get every last ballot.\"\nMiami-Dade processed 510,830 mail-in ballots. In the days right before Election Day, they found 24 ballots at a postal facility that were on their way to voters and hadn\u2019t been delivered. They made sure that they were. They also found six completed ballots. Those came to the election office and were processed.\nOur ruling\nPosts on Facebook and Twitter said that the U.S. Postal Service failed to deliver 27% of mail-in ballots in South Florida.\nThat was based on data that the postal service clearly said did not reflect ballot delivery rates. The sources cited by websites spreading this claim included that reality check.\nThe two largest counties in South Florida went to postal facilities to find any wayward ballots. In one county, they found none. In another they found 30. All issues were resolved before Election Day.\nThere is nothing to this claim. We rate it Pants on Fire.\n\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections FactChat #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click here, for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18456"}
