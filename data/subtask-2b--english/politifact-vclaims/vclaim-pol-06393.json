Trey Gowdy, R-S.C.\nOn Fox News May 15, Gowdy said the State Department is taking far too long in producing documents related to the 2012 terrorist attack on an American diplomatic compound. Gowdy pointed to a November 2014 request for emails from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her top advisers that has yet to be fulfilled.\n\"It's a conscious decision not to cooperate with a legitimate congressional inquiry,\" he said, adding. \"I don't want the drama. I want the documents. They have had half a year and I have not gotten a single, solitary scrap of paper.\"\nBecause the Benghazi investigation -- as well as Clinton\u2019s private email use while secretary of state -- are likely to stay in the news as Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign moves forward, we decided to look into Gowdy\u2019s statement.\nThere\u2019s no denying that the Benghazi committee doesn\u2019t have all the documents it wants and not by the committee\u2019s desired timeline. But it\u2019s inaccurate to say they haven\u2019t received \"a single, solitary scrap of paper\" related to their November request.\nThe committee\u2019s own interim progress report -- published May 8, 2015 -- proves this.\n850 scraps of paper\nIn November, the committee asked for communications and documents about Benghazi for 11 top State Department officials that included Clinton and her senior staff, according to the report. The committee also asked Clinton\u2019s attorney for her private emails related to Benghazi and Libya.\nTwo months later, the committee held a hearing to draw attention to what Gowdy says is a prohibitively slow executive branch response to document requests.\nAfter the hearing, on Feb. 13, 2015, the State Department produced about 300 emails to and from Clinton, totaling about 850 pages.\nOf course, this didn\u2019t completely satisfy the November request, because it didn\u2019t include the emails of Clinton\u2019s top aides and senior staff. The committee ordered a subpoena in March for the rest of these emails. The subpoena has a broader scope than the November request -- for example, requesting all emails pertaining to Libya, not just the attack on the Benghazi compound.\nCommittee spokesman Jamal Ware told PolitiFact that Gowdy\u2019s statement referred to the March subpoena for Clinton\u2019s aides\u2019 emails, which the committee still hasn\u2019t received.\nHowever, Gowdy\u2019s statement includes the qualifier \"They\u2019ve had half a year,\" which would indicate he is talking about the November 2014 request, not the March 2015 subpoena.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the Clinton emails were the committee\u2019s top priority from the November request, according to a State Department document detailing the documents provided. It\u2019s worth noting that more than two-thirds of the Clinton emails are communications with her senior staff, and some senior staff emails pertinent to the November request were included in earlier document releases to the committee.\nIn defense of Gowdy\u2019s statement, Ware added that the Clinton emails don\u2019t necessarily count as State Department documents because Clinton used a private email address while secretary, maintained in her own private server, so the emails were never under State Department control.\n\"The only records the committee has received were self-selected by the former secretary and turned over by her,\" Ware said. \"The State Department did not have control or custody over those emails.\"\nThe department did, though, have at least some modicum of control over these emails. Because of the Benghazi investigation, the department requested and received 50,000 pages of Clinton\u2019s emails weeks before the November request. They read through every email to select the ones that pertained to the November request, resulting in the turnover of 300 emails in February.\nThe State Department contends that they are unable to fully complete records requests within the committee\u2019s desired timeframe in large part due to \"resource and technological restraints.\"\nFor example, going through Clinton\u2019s 50,000 pages of emails took about 2,400 man hours, according to the Washington Post. The State Department had to digitize every single page by hand because Clinton handed over paper copies of her emails, rather than electronic ones, vastly slowing down the process.\nAdditionally, the State Department said it does not have key phrases to search through emails pertaining to the subpoena, so they have to read through every single email over a two-year period for 10 members of Clinton\u2019s senior staff.\nIn response to the State Department\u2019s assertion that how fast they can comply is limited by their resources, the committee\u2019s interim report said, \"While the committee respects the State Department\u2019s institutional interests, it is also important to note that a substantial degree of this effort may result from its own internal review processes rather than any requirements imposed by the committee.\"\nState Department spokesman Alec Gerlach said his office has worked closely with the committee since its inception, noting that over the course of the investigation, the State Department has provided more than 40,000 pages of documents in total.\n\"We have been\u00a0continuously engaged and responsive to the committee\u2019s requests and stated priorities, and we have had several meetings and discussions with them during recent months regarding the specifics of our plans to respond to both their Nov. 18, 2014, letter and their broader March subpoena,\" Gerlach said.\nOur ruling\nGowdy said the State Department has \"had half a year\" to respond to a Benghazi document request, yet \"I have not gotten a single, solitary scrap of paper.\"\nThe House Benghazi Committee\u2019s own report notes that in response to a November 2014 request for emails from Clinton and her top aides, the State Department has produced 850 pages of Clinton\u2019s emails. The State Department hasn\u2019t yet produced Clinton\u2019s staffers\u2019 emails in response to this request. The department argues that Clinton\u2019s emails were top priority, that many of the staffers\u2019 emails have been provided in previous document requests, and that their response time is limited by department resources.\nGowdy has a point that he\u2019s still waiting on quite a few documents, but it goes too far to say he hasn\u2019t received a \"single, solitary scrap of paper.\" We rate his claim Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06393"}
