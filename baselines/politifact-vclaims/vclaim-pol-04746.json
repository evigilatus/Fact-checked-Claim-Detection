Elizabeth Warren and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton had a lot of nice things to say about Cincinnati during their first campaign appearance together in the Ohio city.\nClinton gave props to Cincinnati\u2019s mayor and applauded one city achievement in particular.\n\"Cincinnati is already one of the biggest cities in the country to run 100 percent on clean energy,\" she said. \"Congratulations.\"\nBut what does it mean to say that Cincy \"runs\" on clean energy?\nBuses powered by photosynthesis? City government meets\u00a0by candlelight?\nWe popped the hood for a closer look.\nIt\u2019s more complicated than the city no longer using \"dirty\" power.\nIn 2011, Cincinnati voters approved a ballot initiative allowing the city to bargain for electricity on behalf of its residents. The following year, the City Council accepted a bid from FirstEnergy Solutions to offer a 100 percent Renewable Energy Credit option to the city\u2019s 53,000 residential and commercial electric customers. One renewable energy credit represents one megawatt-hour of renewable electricity produced by facilities like wind farms, solar canopies or hydro-electric dams.\nPeople in Cincinnati still get their power over the wires owned by Duke Energy, the traditional, coal-burning electric utility for the area.\u00a0But FirstEnergy Solutions, as Cincinnati\u2019s \"aggregation provider,\" buys a mix of both locally produced\u00a0renewable electricity and renewable\u00a0energy credits on the city\u2019s behalf.\u00a0Renewable energy credits\u00a0are coded and retired, once purchased, and are used to track the ownership of environmental and social benefits of the renewable energy, not\u00a0the electricity itself.\nIt's complicated stuff, but we'll guide you through it.\nSay you're part of Cincinnati's FirstEnergy\u00a0program, which you would be by default\u00a0unless you opted-out. (Residents got a letter saying they\u00a0could.)\u00a0Your lights turn on using the same electricity as someone who opted to stick with conventional, coal-fed electricity, because once electricity is placed on the electrical grid, it becomes indistinguishable from the\u00a0electricity generated by\u00a0other sources.\nBut when you pay your bill, you're paying for an equivalent supply of power from renewable sources being fed into the grid, be it locally or elsewhere.\u00a0\nLarry Falkin, the director of Cincinnati\u2019s Office of Environment and Sustainability, confirmed that 43,090 electric customers in the city\u00a0and 1,287 small businesses\u00a0participated\u00a0in the renewable energy credit program in 2015, for a total of 405,737 megawatt hours. That's about 81 percent of the\u00a053,000 households in Cincinnati.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden canceled the Keystone pipeline because Warren Buffett \u201cdonated $58 million\u201d to his campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn past years, FirstEnergy\u2019s renewable electricity sources have included the power generated from captured coal mine methane gas at the University of Cincinnati\u2019s Central Utility Plant, and solar power generated at a solar canopy at the Cincinnati Zoo. FirstEnergy has also tapped wind farms in Iowa and Texas, and hydro-electric power from facilities in Virginia and Pennsylvania.\nThere is a hitch. Critics of renewable energy credits argue that it\u2019s almost impossible to confirm that a renewable credit actually displaces a megawatt-hour from a dirty source, like coal.\n\"It would be great if the purchase of certificates made up the difference between conventional and renewable power, but at best this is a token subsidy for renewable energy,\" Daniel Press, an environmental studies professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz, wrote in an editorial for the San Jose Mercury Press.\nSome large corporations that once embraced the renewable-credit model for greening up their profiles have since ditched the credits. Johnson & Johnson\u00a0is one such company that enthusiastically purchased voluntary clean-energy credits in 2000, but has since backed off that strategy. Jed Richardson, J&J\u2019s global energy director, said, \"We decided we were better off investing in renewable generation on our own properties.\"\nThe Cincinnati City Council defended the renewable credit system from a challenge\u00a0in 2014, when the interim city manager recommended returning to Duke Energy for power.\nThe clean-powered households saved as\u00a0much as 28 percent off their utility bills\u00a0when the program began.\u00a0But because of market fluctuations, the savings in the green program had dropped to 8 percent. The city manager\u00a0reversed his stance when the\u00a0majority of the council defended the clean energy program.\nCity Councilman Chris Seelbach told PolitiFact Ohio, \"I successfully led efforts in 2014 to continue having 100 percent of our electricity backed by renewable credits after our administration recommended against it. Fortunately, the administration recommended renewable energy this year, so we didn\u2019t have to fight them.\"\nOther cities that have gone 100 percent renewable include Burlington, Vt. (population 42,452), Greensburg, Kan. (population 798), and Aspen, Colo. (population 6,882). With a population of 297,517, Cincinnati is one of the biggest cities to use this program.\nOur ruling\nClinton congratulated Cincinnati for being \"one of the biggest cities in the country to run 100 percent on clean energy.\"\nClinton's phrasing makes it sound like Cincinnati is free of coal-fed power. The reality \u2014 the city's 100 percent Renewable Energy Credit option \u2014\u00a0is more complicated.\nWhile there are critics of the renewable energy credit system, it is currently the only way to ensure the purchase of power from green sources. The most recent reports show that 43,090 Cincinnati households and 1,287 small businesses participate in the city\u2019s Electricity Aggregation Program.\nThat\u2019s not 100 percent of Cincinnati\u2019s energy consumers \u2014 it\u2019s about 81\u00a0percent of households. But those who are enrolled in the Electricity Aggregation Program can claim that they\u2019re running on 100 percent renewable sources \u2014\u00a0or as close to it as anyone can get, while staying on the grid.\nWe rate this claim Half True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/21054f53-62e8-442a-bcc5-8c5b85e969ad", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04746"}
