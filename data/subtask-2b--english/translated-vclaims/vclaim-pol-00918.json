Jay Ensley, one of the presidential Democrats in 2020, made climate change the focus of his days-long campaign. Just before it was officially announced, he discussed the importance of climate change in an interview, and made this allegation about the impact of fires on his condition: \"The forest fires were so ugly last year that we had the worst air in the world in Washington. We were choking. It's very personal to me.\" Two days after the launch of his campaign, Ensley repeated the allegation of the worst air during another debate on climate change. We wanted to know whether Washington really had a much worse air quality than India or China in 2018. We also wanted to explore the relevance of climate change. While the smoke from the forest fires covered the area during the summer of 2015, Seattle's news reports stated that Seattle had the world's worst air quality on August 21, 2018. Reports referred to the arrangement made on that day of AirVisual, an aerial monitoring service. We were told by air television spokesman Kelsey Duska that during at least some points of that day, Seattle was the worst air in 85 cities, generally with more than 400,000 people, all over the world. Washington was a little better in a broader set of airvisual observations. Duska said that throughout August 2018, the air in Chilan, Wash, was about 180 miles east of Seattle, ranked fifth out of 3,000 cities around the world. Rob Jackson, Professor of Earth System Science at Stanford University, told us that the Irvescual numbers are reliable. Therefore, Ansli &apos; s worst claim is correct for one day of the year. With regard to the larger point of Ensley, experts told us that climate change plays a role in making forest fires, and thus air quality, worse, but there are other factors as well. The Ensley campaign referred to an article published on the national public radio website following the news reports on the worst seattle air arrangement. He carried this address: \"Why did Seattle have the worst air quality in the world at some points this summer.\" In one interview on January 31, 2021, John Kerry said that Hurricane Harvey \"more water fell in Houston in five days than he went over Niagara Falls in one year.\" \"Maas said that Seattle had the worst air in 20 years, \"to the point that mountains and waters around the city were not visible. She was asked why the air was so bad, the mass cited the forest fires, plus that \"we had an air cycle that took the smoke directly from these fires just nearby up in Seattle.\" Mass said he doubted that this would happen again in the future - but he referred to forests, not climate change. \"Well, the big problem is our forests. We've kept the fire now for nearly a century,\" he said. \"Many of the forests surrounding Seattle are in very bad condition. She's over-developed. They have a lot of pieces, a lot of bushes and low trees. It is quite different from the forests that were here 150 years ago. The problem is when they burn, they burn catastrophicly. \"The question is how much of this is climate change. I doubt that only a small proportion of this is climate change. I think the main problem is forests, which are ready to burn. We have gas grass that moved in that burn very easily. Humans are increasingly starting fires with so many people entering recreation, other uses of forest areas,\" he said. \"Now, in the long run, as the planet heats up, we certainly expect more fires. So climate change, global warming may have contributed a small amount to it, but perhaps the main thing is what we did to the surface of the planet.\" Other experts gave greater weight to the role of climate change. Jackson and John Reilly, co-director of the Joint Programme on Global Change Science and Policy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told us that climate change is clearly one of the factors in making forest fires, and, in contrast, air quality, worse. However, they agreed that other factors, such as the suppression of fires, made forest fires worse. Finally, the Ensle campaign also referred to two other articles on forest fires and climate change: the McCluschi news service reported on a federal study in November 2018, in which it said: \"California and the West have already experienced an expansion of catastrophic flames due to climate change and rising temperatures, with forest fires burning twice as much as would otherwise have occurred.\" According to the magazine, an American scientific report on an academic study found that climate change not only increases the likelihood of forest fires, \"fires cause severe rise in air pollution across the west.\" But Daniel Javi, a professor of environmental chemistry at the University of Washington, said in that article that although climate change makes forest fires worse, forest management too. In discussing climate change, Ensley said, \"The forest fires were so ugly last year that we had the worst air in the world in Washington.\" Of 85 major cities around the world, Seattle had the worst air quality in the world on 21 August 2018, with forest fires pushing smoke into the region. That was one day of the year. The experts said that climate change was one of the factors in making forest fires, which in turn increased air quality; however, other factors, such as fire suppression practices, also exacerbated the fires. We appreciate what Ansli said most of the time.
