He also threatened to cancel unspecified federal funds. The camp fire in the rural province of Poti in northern California killed 42 people and destroyed more than 6,400 homes as of Monday, making the state the deadliest and most destructive fire in history. The authorities said that more than 200 persons were still missing. The fire broke out on November 8, 2018 in a forest area near the town of Paradise. At the same time, in Southern California, the Wolsey fire in Ventura and Los Angeles provinces was blamed for the death of two people and destroyed an estimated 435 buildings. That fire started on the outskirts of the hills, not a forest. In his first general comments on fires, Trump tweeted in November 10, 2018: \"There is no reason for these massive, deadly and expensive forest fires in California, but forest management is very bad. Billions of dollars are given each year, with many lives lost, all because of serious forest mismanagement. A cure now, or no more Fed payments!\" He tweeted again in November 11, 2018: \"With sound forest management, we can stop the devastation that continues to occur in California. Be smart!\" Trump &apos; s comments have provoked severe reactions from firefighters and State officials, both because of the threat of withholding funding during an emergency and because of excessive simplification of the causes that cause the fires to be extremely devastating. In a tweet two days later, he thanked firemen and first responders in California. He also approved California &apos; s request to declare a major disaster, freeing federal assistance for fire response and recovery. In view of the strong reaction, we have decided to verify the fact that the President has \"no reason\" for California's fires other than poor forest management. Our research in Trump indicates that the state government controls decisions on how and to what extent to upgrade forests, clean brushes, and place the burns described. In fact, California owns only 2% of the state's forest land, while the federal government owns more than 60%, as Keith Gillis, Professor of Forest Economics and Chairman of the California Forestry and Fire Protection Council, said. The rest are owned by private owners, timber companies and indigenous American tribes. Gillis said that the tree harvest had declined significantly on national forest lands over the past four decades, owing at least in part to the legal challenges faced by the environmentalists involved in the apparent cutting. The professor added that the funds spent in the past on fire prevention had been diverted to combat them. The state has made significant investments in forest management, as he said, but \"has no influence\" on the federal government to do the same. In August, Maclatchi reported to the Trump administration \"the proposal to cut tens of millions of dollars\" to remove the trees. Gillis added that Trump's tweet ignores additional key factors that drive recent \"firestorms\" in California, such as the winds of nearly 60 miles per hour and dry bone conditions. On January 28, 2021 in Facebook blog, bloggers tried to \"close\" the California government's summoning campaign. \u2219 (Gavin Newsom) By Chris Nichols \u2022 2 February 2021 with those extremists, \"even a good setup can be overcome,\" he said. \"I think the biggest problem with comments was lack of precision,\" said Giles, described them as \"uninformed.\" \"It's a complicated situation. Simple statements on a subject like this are always wrong.\" In an interview on CNN, Vice President Scott McLean of the California Forestry and Fire Protection Department refused to respond directly, citing \"the lack of information provided in that tweet.\" He continued to describe changing weather patterns in California. \"What has driven all the fires in these last few years? Wind The behaviour of the volatile wind. High temperatures in the early part of the year that dried up all these plants,\" said McLean. Fire and climate experts also say that the trend towards more people moving to wild areas increases the chances of forest fires. Jesse Miller, an environmental scientist studying forest fires and lectures at Stanford University, described Trump's comments as \"outside the base and not catching the complexity of the situation.\" \"The forest management may be part of the case, but this is most of the federal land there (where the camp fire started east of Chiku). So Trump is actually responsible for most of that land. Nor does it recognize the role of climate change. That's what I think a lot of people are the biggest factor in these fires right now in California.\" The White House did not respond to a request for evidence in support of Trump's tweet. Our President, Governor Trump, claimed in the tweet \"no reason\" for California's deadly fires other than poor forest management. According to forest and climate experts, forest management, which includes forest upgrading, the status of described burns, and brush cleaning, is only one factor. But it's not the only force, it's not necessarily the driving force in the recent firestorms in the state. The stronger winds in California, higher temperatures and drought conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating the fires. This is in addition to the fact that more people are now living in forested areas, which increases the chances of burning hell. Trump puts the blame wrong on only one factor, while ignoring these other causes of California's destructive fires. We value his oversimplification claim wrong. - The statement is not accurate.
