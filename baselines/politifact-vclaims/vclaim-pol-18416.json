A spokesperson from the New York State Board of Elections also said the claim is false.\u00a0\nNovak said he received a tip that several Queens Village residents got pre-marked ballots. He arranged to meet with the man who received a ballot already filled out on the morning of Oct. 30. The man said the ballot had his daughter\u2019s name on it, according to the recorded interview posted by Novak. The video Novak posted on Twitter included a voter ID number.\nHere\u2019s what Vazquez-Diaz said happened. New York City Board of Elections officials investigated the claim and talked to the voter in question. The voter had requested an absentee ballot, which was mailed to her in California. She filled out the ballot herself. It was intended to be mailed to the Board of Elections, but that ballot was accidentally opened by someone else.\u00a0\nVazquez-Diaz said the board has sent the voter a new ballot. There\u2019s no evidence of any other residents who received pre-marked ballots, she said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVazquez-Diaz didn\u2019t respond to follow-up questions about whether the ballot had been sent to a family member and accidentally opened there.
