But there is always hope when it comes to those missing from recent conflicts, she said.\nHere\u2019s how Pierno described the search process:\n\"Imagine a cold-case detective piecing together historical documents,\" she said.\nStaff review a missing service person\u2019s files, interview witnesses and use other methods to determine where the person went missing. If a precise location is found, a team travels there and does an excavation not unlike archeologists searching for dinosaur bones.\n\"There have been identifications made from a single tooth\" and strands of hair, Pierno said.\nEven service members missing from World War II can be identified by matching DNA from remains to the DNA of a family member.\nIndeed, the list of missing continues to get a little bit smaller as more service members are accounted for.\nFor example, a burial was scheduled for Sept. 28, 2013, in Springville, Utah, following the recent recovery of the remains of 2nd Lt. Vernal J. Bird. His bomber crashed in New Guinea in March 1944.\nThe remains of Marine Lance Cpl. Merlin R. Allen of Bayfield, Wis., who was lost June 30, 1967, in a helicopter crash in Thua Thien-Hue Province, Vietnam, were identified in February 2013. A funeral was held several months later.\nAccounting for the missing has not gone without controversy.\nOn Sept. 19, 2013, several weeks after a U.S. Senate subcommittee hearing examined the recovery efforts, Senators Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) and Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) called on the Defense Department to address \"reports of mismanagement and internal divisions\" between the Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office and the Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command.\n\"While we were encouraged to hear that DMPO and JPAC have finally begun work on the long overdue plan\" to delineate responsibilities, the senators said in a statement, \"we were concerned to hear that the plan was still in \u2018coordination.' We were also troubled to learn that the department's approach to accounting may be doing families more harm than good by failing to provide them with a realistic assessment of the possibility of identifying missing service members.\"\nAt the hearing, the director of the Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office had said that during the past year, he and \"others in the personnel accounting community have made significant strides in improving our unity of effort. But this is an issue that clearly needs further work.\"\nOur rating\nScocos said: \"There are still tens of thousands of missing service members from previous and current conflicts that our nation is working to find and repatriate.\"\nOne of the federal agencies responsible for searching for the missing, or at least their remains, puts the official count at more than 83,000 -- all of whom, or nearly all of whom, are deceased.\nWe rate Scocos\u2019 statement True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08821"}
