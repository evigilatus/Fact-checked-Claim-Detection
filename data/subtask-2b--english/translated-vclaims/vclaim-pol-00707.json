Sorus was the target of countless conspiracy theories, and now the fake quote is circulating social media (again) that claims that Soros strongly hates the United States and conspires to destroy it. The complete quote says: \"I have made the task of my life to destroy the United States. I hate this country, and I hate all the people in it. George Soros, Newsweek 1979 \"I refer to the article as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misleading information in the broadcast of the news. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We've looked at all the New Zealand issues from 1979. We found a lot of cigarette ads on entire pages, a feature of skiing and a cover story documenting pictures of \"the closest look of a man to Saturn.\" What we didn't find was any evidence that Soros said something like that. Furthermore, we have looked at more extensive news clips and found no legitimate record that he said so in any other publication or interview. In the 40 years since this quote was published in the news magazine, no reliable source has ever mentioned it - something that could certainly have happened in the light of the emergence of Soros and the inflammatory nature of the commentary. \"George Soros has never made such a statement,\" Laura Sylber, Chief Communications Officer for Open Society Institutions funded by Soros, said Politifact. \"Mr. Soros is deeply interested in the United States and is dedicated to promoting this country's promise to all its people.\" We found that part of the quote was used, with a dark letter, and attributed to Soros in the 2011 Brittbart article, which discusses \"the terrible collapse of society,\" and blames \"the ovens\" and \"the radical left-wings of the 1960s: \"There are those who wish to do nothing more than set these fires on fire. \"The destruction of America will be the culmination of my life's work.\" But the article does not give any details of where or when Soros claims to have said this and simply followed up. We also found a variation in part of the quote in the Reddit string in 2011, where users were trying to find the context of Soros, who allegedly said: \"The destruction of America will be the culmination of my life's work.\" The thread refers to a right-wing blog published in 2010 with the source in the name of the Australian newspaper. On January 12, 2021, he wrote in an Instagram article saying that Joe Biden remained silent about the violence in Black Lives-Mite protests. By Tom Kircher: January 16, 2021, although the blog does not give details of when it is assumed that Soros said so, in an interview between Soros and the newspaper in 2009, Soros spoke of the coronation of his life's work, but nothing close to quoting. This is the exact quote from Australia: \"Peter Wilson: So people bring things to your attention if they think a situation is evolving in a region or market? George Soros: I read the paper, and I have some financial services that I also look at. I'm not at the top of the financial markets. I just don't have enough information about the details so I can just use blunt instruments that are some kind of macroeconomic tool. On the other hand, I am deeply involved in policy issues, and this is where I focus. \"Wilson: What kind of politics? \"Sorus: The financial crisis, how to solve it. And it wasn't something I was particularly interested in before the crisis, and I also participated in the activities of the Soros Foundation. \"Wilson: But over the past 18 months, you've been watching markets? \"Sorus: Yes, but I was also writing a lot more than I was writing before because the crisis really motivated me. I wrote a series of articles during the year, wrote a book, published a book, and I'm about to publish a supplement to last year's book, updated it, and I'm working on it now. \"Wilson: Do you have a sense that things are coming together with you now? \"Sorus: It's somehow the culmination of my life's work, so to speak.\" At no point in exchange does Soros say that the mission of his life is to destroy the United States, or that \"destruction of America\" will be the culmination of his life's work. Here he refers to the resolution of the financial crisis, the books he writes, and his work with the Soros Couture Foundation for his work in his life. Our judgment is attributed to Soros, spreading over social media, claiming that he told New Zealand in 1979 that he had made \"the mission of his life to destroy the United States,\" and that he hated the country and all the people in it. There's no evidence that Soros said anything close to this. Nor has he reported, reviewed or criticized any news source over the past 40 years. That fake quote is pants on fire!
