The former article says Biden won\u2019t ban fracking, while the latter says he \"followed through\" with a ban.\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nThroughout the 2020 presidential election, we fact-checked many claims that Biden would ban fracking, a process used to extract oil and gas from the ground. Several of them misrepresented his position, so we wanted to take a closer look at this post.\n\n(Screenshot from Facebook)\nWe found that it, too, distorts Biden\u2019s actions by making them appear more sweeping than they really are. In short, Biden is doing what he said he would do if elected \u2014 that is, ban new fracking on federal land.\nOn his first day, Biden signed an executive order that put a hold on all oil and gas development in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge. On Jan. 27, he signed an additional executive order that pauses new oil and gas leases on federal land, effectively banning new fracking there for as long as the policy lasts. His moves leave current fracking untouched.\nHeadlines don\u2019t tell the story\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at the Facebook post.\nThe top of it shows the headline of a Washington Post fact-check published in early October. It debunked a Trump campaign ad that said, if elected president, Biden said he will end fracking. The headline: \"Trump campaign promotes false claim that Biden would end fracking.\"\nThe second article in the Facebook post purportedly shows \"what Biden is doing,\" and was published by Town Hall on Jan. 20. Its headline said: \"Biden Administration: Yes, We Are Following Through With a Fracking Ban.\"\nThe Townhall article covers an interaction at the first press briefing of the Biden administration. (The article more accurately explains the type of fracking that Biden promised to block.)\nOn Jan. 20, White House press secretary Jen Psaki answered a reporter\u2019s question about the executive order that Biden signed that day about Alaska oil and gas drilling. Here\u2019s the exchange, in context:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReporter: \"President Biden promised to end all new oil and gas leasing on federal lands when he was a candidate. The order that you just mentioned that he signed today was much narrower than that \u2014\u00a0it's a temporary moratorium and it only applies to (the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge). And there is some debate about whether he has the legal flexibility to even follow through with his full promise. Does the administration still have that commitment today?\nPsaki: \"We do, and the leases will be reviewed by our team. We just have only been in office for less than a day now\"\nWhat Biden signed was an executive order that paused the federal government\u2019s implementation of the Coastal Plain Oil and Gas Leasing Program in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The Trump-era program, passed as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, directed the Interior Department to issue leases for drilling oil and natural gas in the refuge\u2019s coastal plain. Biden\u2019s order also reinstated an Obama-era policy that withdrew certain areas of the Arctic from consideration for oil drilling.\n\"The Secretary (of the Interior) shall review the program and, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, conduct a new, comprehensive analysis of the potential environmental impacts of the oil and gas program,\" Biden\u2019s executive order says.\nBiden\u2019s move tracked with his climate change plan, which calls for banning fracking on federal lands but not all fracking.\nRELATED:\u00a0Biden Promise Tracker\nOn Jan. 27 \u2014\u00a0after the Facebook post and Townhall article were published \u2014\u00a0Biden signed an additional executive order that directs the interior secretary to \"pause new oil and natural gas leases on public lands or in offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review.\" It would effectively prevent new fracking projects on federal land.\nThe Interior Department said the order \"does not impact existing operations or permits for valid, existing leases, which are continuing to be reviewed and approved.\" Biden reiterated that point in remarks to the press.\n\"Let me be clear, and I know this always comes up: We're not going to ban fracking,\" he said.\nOur ruling\nThe Facebook post says Biden is \"following through with a fracking ban.\"\nThat\u2019s not quite right.\nBiden has signed two executive orders related to land leases for oil and natural gas drilling. One order pauses new leases specifically in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, while the other pauses new leases on all federal land. Neither ban existing fracking operations, and Biden has said repeatedly that he does not intend to do so.\nThe Facebook post contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.
