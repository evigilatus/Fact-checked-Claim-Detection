Similar sentiments are older, Popkik says in the post, dating back to the late 1980s. But he doesn\u2019t mention Bill Murray.\u00a0\nIn 2013, however, a parody Bill Murray Twitter account tweeted the quote that appears in the Facebook post, right down to the misspelling of \"it\u2019s.\"\n\"I AM NOT BILL MURRAY,\" reads the account\u2019s bio. \"This is a parody account.
