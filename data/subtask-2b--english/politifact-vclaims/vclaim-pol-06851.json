Still, it\u2019s pretty clear from some readers\u2019 comments that the claim is not universally taken too seriously.\n\"The heck with mailing the kids. I wanna mail myself some place warm,\" one commenter wrote.\n\"So thankful with today\u2019s technology, we can now fax \u2019em,\" wrote another.\nBut is it true? Was it legal in 1913, or at any time, to mail children? PolitiFact Georgia readers who have been bombarded with re-posts of the claim asked us to weigh it on the ol\u2019 AJC Truth-O-Meter.\nWe contacted Nancy Pope, a historian and curator at the Smithsonian National Postal Museum in Washington. She told us there were \"a handful\" of children, who were \"mailed\" after the Postal Service created the parcel post service in 1913.\nThese children, for the most part, were sent short distances, not across the country or internationally, Pope said.\nThey also were typically delivered personally to their destination by a rural letter carrier \u2014 someone well-known and trusted in the community, considered on par with a member of the local clergy, she said.\n\"The trust in the mail at that point was almost sacrosanct,\" Pope said.\nMailing children \u2014 with stamps attached to their clothes \u2014 occurred as customers and Postal Service workers were becoming accustomed to the new service, which allowed packages weighing 50 pounds or less to be shipped by freight train at rates often cheaper than a child\u2019s train ticket.\nBut was it ever officially legal to mail a child? No, Pope said.\n\"The law did not specifically address (mailing children) when parcel post began Jan. 1, 1913, because nobody thought anybody would do such a stupid thing,\" she said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 22, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden \u201chas issued more executive fiats than anyone in such a short period of time, ever, more than Obama, more than Trump, more than anyone.\u201d\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA year later, when a few children had been \"mailed\" and made the news, Postmaster General Albert S. Burleson issued a memo to the nation\u2019s postmasters, advising them that all human beings were barred from being mailed, Pope said.\nThe first child \"mailed\" in the U.S. was an unnamed boy in Ohio. The kid\u2019s parents paid 15 cents for stamps and insured the child for $50 in January 1913 to have a rural Free Delivery carrier take their boy to his grandmother\u2019s house a mile away, according to the Postal Service.\nA year later, May Pierstorff was sent by parcel post from her parents\u2019 home in Idaho to her grandparents\u2019 house about 73 miles away for 53 cents worth of stamps. May traveled with a relative who worked on the Railway Mail trains in early 1914, Pope said. (She\u2019s one of the children in pictures on the Facebook post.)\nA book, \"Mailing May,\" chronicles May\u2019s adventure shortly before her sixth birthday.\nThe longest known trip reportedly cost 15 cents. A 6-year-old from Pensacola, Fla., was mailed through parcel post from her mother\u2019s home in Florida to her father\u2019s home in Virginia, having just made it under the 50-pound limit, according to reports at the time.\n\"Babies were not being put in boxes or dumped in mailboxes,\" Pope said. \"It was just a less expensive way to get the kids to see the grandparents.\"\nPope wasn\u2019t surprised to hear from us. She said reports about the \"mailed\" children began popping up all over the Internet in 2013, the 100th anniversary of the creation of the parcel post service. A second anniversary \u2014 the centennial of May Pierstorff\u2019s delivery to her grandparents in 1914 \u2014 has kept the buzz going, she said.\nThe claim attracted the attention of Snopes.com, the website known for debunking urban legends and Internet rumors, which found it was a mixture of truth and falsehood.\nSo where does this leave us?\nThe Facebook post says \"In 1913, it was legal to mail children.\"\nPostal historians say no more than a handful of children were mailed after the parcel post service was created in 1913. The law at the time didn\u2019t specify that it was illegal to mail children, but officials say no one had envisioned a situation where that had to be spelled out.\nWhen there was evidence that children were indeed being mailed, the postmaster general sent a memo in 1914 barring human beings from postal delivery.\nThe Facebook post needs a whole lot of context. It leaves the wrong impression that children were being mailed legally in 1913. A few mailings did occur, but the practice \u2014 never legally sanctioned \u2014 was quickly abandoned.\nPolitiFact\u2019s definition of Mostly False is a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. That seems to fit this one like a roll of bubble wrap.\nWe rate the Facebook post Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06851"}
