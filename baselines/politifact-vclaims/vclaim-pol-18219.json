At stake is a 10-year seat on the state\u2019s highest court, where conservatives currently hold a 5-2 majority.\nThe Republican State Leadership Committee released multiple ads March 26, 2020, addressing Karofsky\u2019s time as a Dane County prosecutor 20 years ago.\nBacked by the requisite ominous music, one ad says this:\n\"Liberal Jill Karofsky \u2014 dangerously soft on crime. As prosecutor, Karofsky even went easy on criminal predators, like no jail time for a monster who sexually assaulted a 5-year-old girl.\"\n\n\n\nA second ad uses almost identical wording, saying \"as a prosecutor, she went easy on criminal predators.\"\nIn both ads, on-screen text notes the case in question is that of Donald A. Worley.\nBut a closer look at the case file reveals a major oversight in the ad.\nHere\u2019s what we found.\nAd hinges on 20-year-old case\nThe Republican State Leadership Committee \u2014 which seeks to elect down-ballot state officials \u2014 is no stranger to Wisconsin politics. It made late forays into a number of previous races, including ads in support of conservative Brian Hagedorn in his successful 2019 Supreme Court bid and in support of Republicans when they took over control of the state Legislature in 2010.\nThis time around it's spending its\u00a0money attacking Karofsky by highlighting the Worley case. Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce is also funding airtime for the ad.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Instagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Madison man, then 26, was charged in February 1999 with child enticement and first-degree sexual assault of a child \u2014 serious felonies that carried decades of potential prison time.\nA plea agreement reached in March 2000 reduced both offenses to misdemeanors, and Worley was sentenced to three years probation with no jail time, online court records show.\nThose online records list Karofsky as the prosecutor, which is what both groups pointed to when asked for evidence backing the ad.\n\n\n\nBut they missed a critical detail: online court records list only the most recent prosecutor. Many district attorneys' offices have different prosecutors handle hearings over the course of a given case, and that\u2019s what happened here.\nWrong prosecutor\nThe prosecution\u2019s file from Worley\u2019s case, provided by Karofsky\u2019s team, details which prosecutor handled different elements of the case.\nThe prosecuting attorney for each appearance initials the file, and Dan Martin\u2019s initials are listed alongside appearances from the preliminary hearing in February 1999 to the request to close the case in March 2000 following the sentencing hearing.\nSo Martin \u2014\u00a0not Karofsky \u2014\u00a0was at the controls when the plea deal was made.\nThe file shows Karofsky didn\u2019t touch the case until more than a year after the plea agreement and sentencing. She represented the office for a motion hearing in July 2001, where the state requested that Worley not be allowed to remain in his family residence.\nDane County District Attorney Ismael Ozanne confirmed the accuracy of the case file record in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin.\nKarofksy\u2019s campaign issued a news release March 27, 2020, demanding the ads be taken down, and noting a cease-and-desist letter would be issued.\nOur ruling\nA pair of attack ads\u00a0say Karofsky was \"soft\" as a prosecutor because she allowed Worley to get away with no jail time.\nBut Karofsky didn\u2019t touch the case until more than a year after the plea agreement reducing the charges and the sentencing imposing no jail time. The ad is based on sloppy research that misunderstood the meaning of the online case records.\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18219"}
