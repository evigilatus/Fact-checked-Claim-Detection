Ted Cruz, looking to gain momentum against GOP presidential frontrunner Donald Trump ahead of the Indiana primary, contended that Trump\u2019s economic policies would hurt Hoosiers and Americans across the country.\nCruz said on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press that his top priority is to bring manufacturing jobs back to Indiana, and he has a \"real policy agenda\" to do it, unlike Trump. \u00a0\n\"Donald\u2019s only economic agenda is imposing massive taxes on the American people with a 40 percent tax hike of a giant tariff,\" Cruz said. \"That would send us into a recession. It would drive jobs overseas. It would kill small businesses.\"\nIs Cruz right that the only idea up Trump\u2019s sleeve is a giant tax on imports?\nTrump has certainly floated the idea of imposing tariffs on goods made overseas, but it\u2019s not the only item on his economic agenda. And though it\u2019s not entirely clear whether the tariffs would amount to 40 percent tax hike, experts agree that the costs would be passed onto U.S. consumers and businesses.\nLet\u2019s begin with what Trump has proposed.\nTrump\u2019s plan to correct \u2018stupid trade\u2019\nFirst, Trump has outlined a few other economic proposals beyond tariffs like declaring China a currency manipulator, upholding intellectual property law, ending China\u2019s export subsidies (more on this later) and lowering the corporate tax rate to incentivize American companies to stay at home. He\u2019s also suggested renegotiating or pulling out the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and stopping the Trans-Pacific\u00a0Partnership.\nBut Cruz has a point that Trump has talked at length about imposing tariffs on imported goods as a remedy for trade imbalances and lost American jobs. He\u2019s specified a 35 percent tariff on some goods coming from Mexico and 45 percent tax on all Chinese products, which he said in the last Republican debate is a \"threat\" that he\u2019d only enact it if \"they don\u2019t follow the rules.\"\nHere are some of the comments Trump has made regarding tariffs:\n\u2022 Candidacy announcement speech, June 16, 2015: Trump said he\u2019ll tax China \"until they behave properly\" and charge a 35 percent tax on \"every truck and every part manufactured in (the Ford plant in Mexico) that comes across the border.\"\n\u2022 Interview with the New York Times editorial board, Jan. 7, 2016: \"I would tax China coming in, products coming in. I would do a tariff. And they do it to us. ... I would do a tax. And let me tell you what the tax should be. The tax should be 45 percent. That would be a tax that would be an equivalent to some of the kind of devaluations that they\u2019ve done. They cannot believe that we haven\u2019t done this yet.\"\n\u2022 GOP primary debate in South Carolina, Feb. 13, 2016: Trump said he\u2019ll tell Carrier, the American air conditioner company that announced a move to Mexico, \"we're going to tax you when those air conditioners come. So stay where you are or build in the United States because we are killing ourselves with trade pacts that are no good for us and no good for our workers.\"\n\u2022 GOP primary debate in Miami, March 10, 2016: \"If you don't tax certain products coming into this country from certain countries that are taking advantage of the United States and laughing at our stupidity, we're going to continue to lose businesses and we're going to continue to lose jobs. ...The 45 percent is a threat that if they (China) don't behave, if they don't follow the rules and regulations so that we can have it equal on both sides, we will tax you. It doesn't have to be 45, it could be less.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking Americans pay for the haul\nTrump\u2019s tariff proposals have been called \"uneducated,\" \u00a0\"worrisome\" and \"entirely ridiculous,\" and many economists (though not all) say they would hurt Americans. However, Cruz may be overstating the impact.\n\"The biggest losers would be U.S. consumers and companies,\" said Scott Lincicome, an international trade law and policy expert at the libertarian Cato Institute.\nTariffs at the level Trump is suggesting would cause prices of cheap products like air conditioners and intermediate goods like auto parts to soar and could cost\u00a0U.S. jobs. But as some of the costs would be absorbed by Chinese and Mexican exporters, a 40 percent tariff doesn\u2019t translate directly into a 40 percent tax hike.\n\"You would have to do some analysis to determine how much of a tax hike it is, but it is probably significantly less than 40 percent,\" said Joel Trachtman, a trade law specialist at the University of Maryland.\nTrachtman noted, however, that the sum of all Trump\u2019s trade proposals \u2014 including the rejection of free trade agreements \u2014 may get you to a 40 percent hike.\nTrump\u2019s tariffs would also see push back from the World Trade Organization, Lincicome pointed out, as Mexico City and Beijing wouldn\u2019t take them lying down.\n\"The WTO sanctions these types of duties targeting export markets with the stroke of a pen. That\u2019s just insane,\" he said. \"It\u2019s a blatant violation of WTO rules. He would get us involved with a bunch of litigation and retaliation.\"\nFor example, the 35 percent tariff the United States imposed on Chinese tires in 2009 cost American consumers $1.1 billion in 2011 and the U.S. chicken industry $1 billion, according to analysis by the nonpartisan Peterson Institute for International Economics.\nThe price of Chinese-made car tires rose by 26 percent, so the United States imported from countries like Thailand, Indonesia and Mexico instead and paid a premium for the shift. China also retaliated by slapping a tariff on American poultry, reducing chicken exports by 90 percent.\nLooking ahead, Trump\u2019s suggested tariffs for Mexican imports would significantly affect the U.S. auto industry and would-be American car buyers. For example, the base price of a Chrysler Ram pick-up truck, which is currently assembled in Mexico, would increase by $9,000, according to Reuters. And like China, Mexico could return the favor by taxing U.S. goods as they\u2019ve done in the past.\nOur ruling\nCruz said Trump\u2019s \"only economic agenda is imposing massive taxes on the American people with a 40 percent tax hike of a giant tariff.\"\nTariffs are not Trump\u2019s \"only\" economic proposal. But Trump has trumpeted taxing Mexican and Chinese imports by 35 and 45 percent respectively.\nMost economists agree that American consumers and manufactures would bear some of the cost of these tariffs, though it\u2019s not entirely clear if prices would increase by 40 percent, as Cruz says.\nCruz\u2019s claim is partially accurate. We rate it Half True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/fd0657bd-5afd-42ce-92a4-f6fef1cd8d00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05021"}
