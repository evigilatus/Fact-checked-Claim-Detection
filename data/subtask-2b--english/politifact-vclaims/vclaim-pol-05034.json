NAACP president says 80 percent think the minimum wage should be $10 or more", "text": "In the rallies against North Carolina\u2019s new LGBT law, commonly known as HB2, protesters have represented not just gay and transgender activists. Also present Monday for the rallies outside the legislature were Latino activists and supporters of the Black Lives Matter and Rise Up for $15 movements.\nThe law doesn\u2019t just ban transgender people from using the bathroom of the gender they identify with. It also bans local governments \u2013 cities and counties \u2013 from raising the minimum wage that businesses within their boundaries would have to pay workers.\nRev. William Barber, president of the N.C. NAACP, said the crowds of protesters were more diverse than just LGBT activists because of the wage issue.\nAnd in a speech just days before Monday\u2019s protests, he said the bathroom issue was actually a Trojan Horse, of sorts, for what he deems the real intent of the law \u2013 stopping cities from raising the minimum wage, as such cities as Seattle and Los Angeles have recently done.\n\"Eighty percent of North Carolinians are for the living wage,\" Barber said. \"So if North Carolina's legislature and the governor had just put on the table a straight bill to make a prohibition against living wages, they would have been going against 80 percent of North Carolinians.\"\nA higher minimum wage is often opposed by Republican politicians. But if Barber was right, a higher minimum wage is a true bipartisan issue \u2013 something that 4 out of 5 people support in a state where 4 out of 10 are Democrats.\nWhat is a living wage?\nPolling on this issue is all over the place. There are many ways to ask the question. Some polls give a specific number they test for approval; some let the respondents choose a number; some simply ask whether the minimum wage should be higher; some ask who should have the power to make that decision.\nBut first, perhaps we should define \"living wage,\" the phrase Barber used in place of \"higher minimum wage.\" It\u2019s not just a political catchphrase; there are actual ways of calculating it.\nIn 2004, an MIT professor of economic geography and regional planning created what she called the Living Wage Calculator. Accounting for location-specific factors such as the cost of food, childcare, housing, transportation and taxes, the tool determines the \"living wage\" as well as \"poverty wage\" for states, counties and metro areas. It gives numbers in both wage categories for single adults or couples, and households with zero to three children.\nIt also assumes full-time employment of 2,080 work hours per year (40 hours a week for 52 weeks). For the purposes of this report, we\u2019ll look at the wage for a single person with no children.\nRight now the federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour, although some states and cities have gone higher. North Carolina has not, and as Barber accurately said, the state has now forbidden any individual city or county from raising it.\nIn Wake and Mecklenburg counties \u2013 the two largest in North Carolina \u2013 the Living Wage Calculator says a living wage would be right about $11 an hour.\nThe state average is $10.53, and 13 of 14 metropolitan areas are above $10.\nA person working full time for $10.53 an hour would make $21,902.40 a year. At the current minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, that same person would make $15,080 a year \u2013 a difference of more than $6,800.\nRecent polling\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that we know what a living wage is, we can look to see whether Barber is right about 80 percent support.\nThe topic isn\u2019t surveyed much at the state level, but luckily two polls have tackled this topic in the last month.\nThey\u2019re from the left-leaning Public Policy Polling and the more centrist Elon University Poll. A spokesman for the state\u2019s main right-leaning polling firm, The Civitas Institute, said there\u2019s no record of Civitas ever having polled people on the topic of minimum wage.\nPublic Policy Polling found that 76 percent of North Carolinians support a minimum wage of at least $10 an hour. That isn\u2019t an exact confirmation of Barber\u2019s claim, since it\u2019s slightly lower than 80 percent and the living wage is $10.53, not $10, but it\u2019s pretty close.\nHowever, the Elon poll found less support for a $10 or higher minimum wage, 65 percent. It also arrived at that number differently than PPP.\nPPP gave five choices, asking people to say if they thought there shouldn\u2019t be a minimum wage, if it should remain $7.25, or if it should increase to $10, $12 or $15.\nElon asked people to name whatever they thought the minimum wage should be. A plurality (27 percent) said $10. In total, 65 percent said $10 or higher.\nThat\u2019s certainly less than the 80 percent claim Barber made or the 76 percent that PPP found. But complicating matters, Elon also found less support than PPP for keeping the current minimum wage.\nThe difference is that many in the Elon Poll (23 percent) named a number between $7.26 and $9.99 \u2013 an option that PPP didn\u2019t give.\nSo while the Elon poll found only 65 percent support for wages that could be called a living wage under the MIT definition, it did find 88 percent support for raising the minimum wage at least a little.\nPolitical breakdown\nBarber framed his claim in the context of the state\u2019s Republican leaders trying to avoid blowback for putting restrictions on a higher minimum wage. So we decided to look at how Republicans feel about the subject.\nJust like they phrased their questions differently, PPP and Elon also asked about party affiliations differently.\nPPP found that 63 percent of people who voted for Mitt Romney in 2012 also support at least a $10 minimum wage, as do 92 percent of Barack Obama voters and 65 percent of others.\nThe Elon poll found that 46 percent of self-identified Republicans support a $10 or higher minimum wage, compared with 86 percent of Democrats and with 62 percent of others.\nOur ruling\nIt\u2019s impossible to say for certain that a full 80 percent of North Carolinians want a living wage in North Carolina, like Barber said. But it does appear that a vast majority support the idea, including about half of Republicans and nearly all Democrats.\nOne recent poll found 76 percent support for a $10 or higher minimum wage. With a margin of error of 3.4 points, Barber\u2019s 80 percent claim would be well within reason if this was the only recent poll. But another recent poll found just 65 percent support. The average of the two polls is 70.5 percent.\nWe rate this claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05034"}
