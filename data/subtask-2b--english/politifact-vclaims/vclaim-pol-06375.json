She makes more per hour at a speaking gig than the average CEO does in a year. Let me say that again: She makes more at a speaking gig in an hour than the average CEO does in a year. But let\u2019s have her lecture us about those out of control CEO salaries.\"\nA reader wanted to know if that was true.\nThe Clinton presidential campaign did not comment for this fact-check. A spokesperson for Beck could also not be reached.\nClinton\u2019s pay\nSince leaving her post as secretary of state in 2013, Clinton has earned millions of dollars from giving talks at universities, corporations and industry groups. So has her husband.\nThe Clinton Foundation recently disclosed speaking engagements by Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton that brought in between $12 million and $26 million for the foundation. The foundation counts 16 Hillary Clinton speeches without giving specific amounts, including nine in the range of $250,001-$500,000 and seven within $100,001-$250,000.\nThose fees go to the foundation. What about fees that go to the Clintons themselves?\nHillary Clinton\u2019s 2015 financial disclosure provides more specific information about 51 additional speeches in 2014 and 2015. The honorariums varied in amount, so here are some examples:\nOn the lower end of the scale, Salesforce.com paid $125,000, the California Medical Association paid $100,000, and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce paid $150,000. On the high end, Biotechnology Industry Organization and Qualcomm paid $335,000, eBay paid $315,000, and Cisco paid $325,000.\nMore typical were honorariums around $225,000, such as from speeches to a Silicon Valley conference for women, Commercial Real Estate Women Network, SalesForce.com, the Council of Insurance Agents and Brokers, Ameriprise\u00a0and the National Council for Behavioral Healthcare, among others.\nWith that background in mind, let\u2019s compare her speaking fees to the average pay of CEOs.\nCEO pay\nThere are a few ways of talking about CEO pay, and it comes down to how you define the average CEO. Workers with that job description can make anywhere from five to nine figures.\nBeck might be referencing a widely shared Washington Examiner story that compared Clinton\u2019s \"reported premium speaking fee of $300,000 per speech\" to the earnings of the country\u2019s top 10 highest-paid CEOs (as reported by Forbes). The Examiner broke down the CEOs\u2019 total compensation by a federal standard of 2,080 yearly work-hours.\nThe result: If you broke down CEO pay by the hour, they would earn\u00a0$54,213 compared to Clinton\u2019s $300,000 speaking fee (which is on the high side of what we found).\nThe Examiner also points out that, realistically speaking, it takes more than an hour to make a speech happen \u2014 there\u2019s also speech prep, travel, and time for meals and rest to consider, too.\nHowever, Beck\u2019s statement did not include the hourly nuance at all. He simply compared one Clinton speech to the annual income of a CEO.\nBy one measure from the liberal Economic Policy Institute, Beck is way, way off.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe think tank found that CEOs of the country\u2019s top 350 firms received average compensation of $15.2 million in 2013, the latest year for which data is available. The EPI researchers used data from Compustat, which pulls in chief executive salaries from publicly held companies as reported to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThat\u2019s several zeroes away from Clinton\u2019s average $225,000 speech in 2014 and 2015.\nThe AFL-CIO compiled a list of the 100 highest-paid CEOs in 2014. No. 100 was Dr. Leonard Bell of Alexion Pharmaceuticals, who earned $20 million.\nNaturally, the income of the average CEO decreases as you expand the definition of who is a CEO.\nEconomist Mark Perry of the conservative American Enterprise Institute critiques the EPI methodology for neglecting CEO salaries on the lower end of the spectrum. \u00a0\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics identifies 246,240 people by the title of \"chief executive.\" Looking at that group, as of May 2014, the average wages was $180,700. For the more than 21,000 employees within that group who work as managers of companies and enterprises, average annual pay was about $216,100.\nWhile those figures are less than the typical Clinton speaking fee, they\u2019re an incomplete picture of what people who classify themselves as chief executives make.\nFor one, as our colleagues FactCheck.org pointed out, the BLS data does not factor in stock options, bonuses and other benefits that typically round out a CEO\u2019s total compensation.\nSeveral reports back up that salary comprises at least less than half of total compensation for many CEOs.\u00a0\nFor instance, salary made up just 10 percent of a\u00a0CEO's total compensation in 2012, according to\u00a0an Associated Press analysis\u00a0of about 320 companies.\u00a0A survey of 50 big-company CEOs for the Wall Street Journal found cash pay made up\u00a0about 37 percent of a CEO's total compensation in 2014. Expanding the pool, Equilar determined that of the S&P 1500 CEOs, 20.8 percent of the pay mix in 2014\u00a0was for\u00a0salary.\nAlso, the BLS averages include chief executives in Puerto Rico, as well as those who work in the public sector at schools and in government that might not fit the classic CEO definition. (Those groups, by the way, all see below-average wages, according to BLS.)\nPlus, counting every CEO\u2019s pay overlooks that the vast majority employ few workers, said Lawrence Mishel, Economic Policy Institute president and an economist who worked on the executive pay research.\n\"That\u2019s cute but highly misleading,\" Mishel said of Perry\u2019s criticism, \"because it doesn\u2019t reflect that the average worker works for a large firm, and the average CEO works for a very small firm.\"\nThe CEOs of small- to mid-sized businesses also often own large chunks of their businesses that can be sold as capital gains or passed down to heirs, which would not be counted as compensation, said Kevin Murphy, University of Southern California finance professor.\nThe debate about who counts as a typical CEO could also be applied to the worlds of professional athletes, musicians and actors.\n\"The fact is that, in many occupations with \u2018superstars,\u2019 the distribution of pay is highly skewed in the sense that the pay for the top earners may be many multiples of the pay for the median person in that occupation,\" Murphy said. \"Perhaps it\u2019s best for us to always qualify \u2018CEO\u2019 with \u2018Superstar CEO\u2019 or \u2018S&P 500 CEO\u2019 to avoid confusion.\"\nOur ruling\nBeck said Hillary Clinton \"makes more at a speaking gig in an hour than the average CEO does in a year,\" in the context of Clinton criticizing \"out of control CEO salaries.\"\nThis is an example of imperfect data.\nWhat\u2019s clear is Clinton earned north of $200,000 for a typical paid appearance. But what\u2019s complicated is comparing that one-off event to what a CEO makes in a year.\nLooking at CEOs of large companies, Beck\u2019s claim completely falls apart.\nThe data that puts Beck\u2019s claim in the best light, from BLS, is incomplete. It doesn\u2019t include stock options, bonuses and other benefits that typically make up an executive\u2019s compensation package. Nor does it account for CEOs of small and medium-sized business who have ownership stakes. At the same time, it includes people classified as chief executives in the public sector, as well as in Puerto Rico \u2014 groups that drag the average salary down.\nBeck's statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.
