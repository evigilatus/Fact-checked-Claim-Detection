Food stamp recipients in Vermont dropped 12K under his watch.", "text": "President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign announced in an email to Vermont media this week that it will be deploying resources to Vermont to help elect Republicans up and down the ballot in 2020. \u00a0\nIn the email, the campaign took credit for the economic improvement the state has seen under Trump\u2019s presidency.\u00a0\nIt said that since he took office in 2017, Trump has added thousands of jobs across the state and given Vermonters an average tax cut of about $1,500.\u00a0\nIt also claimed that under Trump, fewer Vermonters have had to rely on food stamps.\n\"President Trump has lifted the prospect of voters across Vermont, overseeing a 11,742 decline of Vermont residents on food stamps,\" the campaign wrote.\u00a0\nWe know that Trump is in favor of restricting food stamp eligibility, and has even proposed a rule change that would cut benefits worth $7.5 million to about 5,200 households in Vermont.\u00a0\nBut has his presidency really led to reduced demand for the benefits?\u00a0\nTrump\u2019s campaign, which did not respond to a request for comment, is correct that since the president took office, Vermont has seen about 12,000 fewer people using food stamps.\u00a0\nWhen he entered the White House in January 2017, Vermont had 78,878 residents receiving benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) program, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\u00a0\nIn August 2019, the last month for which public data was available, that number was 67,195 \u2014 representing a drop of 11,683.\u00a0\nBut data also show that the demand for food stamps in Vermont has been falling consistently since around 2013, when Vermont\u2019s economy started turning a corner after the Great Recession.\u00a0\nAt peak demand in 2013, about 100,000 Vermonters were using food stamps. By January 2017, when Trump took office, that number had already fallen to about 79,000.\u00a0\nSean Brown, deputy commissioner of Vermont\u2019s Economic Services Division, said that since 2013, when the economy took a turn for the better and jobs started returning to the state, food stamps in Vermont have seen steady decline in use.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTommy Thompson\n\n\nstated on December 1, 2011 in a campaign announcement video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that as Wisconsin governor, \"we ended welfare.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 December 11, 2011\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That\u2019s just been a trend that we\u2019ve been experiencing for the last six years as the economy has improved and stayed strong,\" Brown said.\u00a0\nSince 2014, the steady decline in demand for SNAP benefits has been a national trend, according to Elaine Waxman, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute\u2019s Income and Benefits Policy Center.\u00a0\nShe said that Trump deserves some credit for the drop in Vermont and around the U.S., because the economy during his time in office has remained strong. But she said it can\u2019t all be pinned on his presidency.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"It\u2019s been a continuation of a trend that\u2019s already begun,\" Wexler said. \"Certainly the continued improvement of the economy contributes to that because more people are working and more people may have income available that would put them above that cutoff but it wouldn\u2019t solely be related to one administration or the other.\"\u00a0\nErin O\u2019Brien, an associate professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts Boston who specializes in\u00a0 U.S. social welfare policy, said that it may not just be the economy that\u2019s leading fewer Vermonters to use food stamps.\u00a0\nTrump\u2019s proposed cuts to SNAP may also be discouraging more people from using the program, she said. And she added that undocumented immigrants may be\u00a0avoiding signing up for food stamps, fearing Trump\u2019s hard-line immigration policies.\u00a0\n\"It\u2019s not necessarily that people are being lifted out of poverty,\" she said. \"It\u2019s that they\u2019re increasingly afraid to use a government program, or they think it might be cut.\"\u00a0\nShe said that \"correlation isn\u2019t causation,\" and that just because the demand for food stamps has fallen under Trump doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s responsible for the trend.\u00a0\n\"Sitting presidents like to take credit for trends that predate them when they\u2019re positive, but when it\u2019s bad news sitting presidents are very good at blaming the last guy in office,\" she said.\u00a0\nOur ruling\u00a0\nTrump\u2019s campaign is right about the numbers. About 12,000 fewer Vermonters are on food stamps now than when he first took office.\u00a0\nBut while he may have overseen a decline of Vermonters using the program, the trend has been occurring for years, since the state rebounded from the Great Recession.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s true that the economy has remained strong under Trump\u2019s presidency. But the steady drop in demand for food stamps had started long before he took office, and may not be entirely attributable to economic uplift.\u00a0\u00a0\nWe rate this claim Mostly True.\u00a0\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this article misspelled Elaine Waxman\u2019s name.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16754"}
