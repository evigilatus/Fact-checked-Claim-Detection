Ted Poe says new Medicare rules require nine billing codes for turkey injuries", "text": "Doctors\u2019 offices, already burdened by federal billing bureaucracy, will soon find themselves pecked to death by new rules, Texas congressman Ted Poe says.\n\nNew diagnosis codes required for reimbursement are so specific, he told Fox Business Network host John Stossel, there are a set of them just for injuries caused by turkeys.\n\n\"Whether you run into a turkey or the turkey runs into you, you're pecked by a turkey or you're bitten by a turkey, there's a difference between being pecked and being bitten,\" he said in an interview April 25, 2013. \"So they have nine codes for turkeys.\"\n\nPoe, a fifth-term Republican who\u2019s a member of the Tea Party Caucus, argues doctors shouldn\u2019t have to face the expense of complying with new rules or penalties for screwing up.\n\n\"Do they need to go through this much detail to get information to the federal government? I don\u2019t think they do,\" he said.\n\nWe had to know: Do new Medicare billing guidelines include \"nine codes for turkeys\"?\n\nOutdated codes\n\nFirst, a little background about this code thing. It\u2019s not just a U.S. system \u2014 it\u2019s international.\n\n(And in case you were wondering, it has nothing to do with Obamacare.)\n\nThe \"new\" set of diagnosis codes that Poe talked about is known as ICD-10. \"ICD\" stands for \"International Classification of Diseases.\" It\u2019s published by the World Health Organization, then adapted for use in the United States.\n\nThe United States now uses ICD-9, which is more than three decades old.\n\nDoctors\u2019 offices use the codes to fill out Medicare and Medicaid claims, among other things. Their billing and practice management software is based on them. Their employees are trained to use them.\n\nThe American Medical Association says that depending on the size of the medical practice, it\u2019ll cost $83,290 to more than $2.7 million to switch.\n\nDoctors are dealing with so many other expensive regulatory changes, the association has begged since 2011 to delay or give up on the switch altogether.\n\nOther countries have charged ahead.\n\nThey started to adopt the \"new\" set of codes nearly 20 years ago, and most developed countries now use it, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nCMS will require American doctors, indeed, any organization covered by the 1996 health care law known as HIPAA, to switch by Oct. 1, 2014.\n\nThe federal government says the United States needs to upgrade partly because ICD-9 has outdated medical terms and not enough detail for accurate claims processing.\n\nClaims for two different injuries might seem like duplicate filings if you couldn\u2019t specify right vs. left hand, for example.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Poe suggested, the new system does have far more diagnosis codes than the version developed in the 1970s \u2014 68,000 instead of 13,000.\n\n(Poe, in his Stossel interview, said the new system has 140,000 codes, but that\u2019s only if you group both diagnosis and procedure codes \u2014 not a direct comparison with 13,000.)\n\nHow much detail are we talking?\n\nThe codes allow doctors to specify not just injuries from turkeys, but from parrots, macaws, ducks and geese.\n\nThere\u2019s a different code for being \"struck\" vs. \"pecked\" or suffering from \"other contact\"\u2014 with specification for the first time, an unlucky repeat or even worse, \"sequela.\" (That would be some \"negative afteraffect\" resulting from your turkey encounter. Headaches! Panic attacks!)\n\nPoe\u2019s office pointed us to this:\n\nW61.4 Contact with turkey\n\nW61.42 Struck by turkey\n\n\nW61.42XA initial encounter\n\nW61.42XD subsequent encounter\n\nW61.42XS sequela\n\n\nW61.43 Pecked by turkey\n\n\nW61.43XA initial encounter\n\nW61.43XD subsequent encounter\n\nW61.43XS sequela\n\n\nW61.49 Other contact with turkey\n\n\nW61.49XA initial encounter\n\nW61.49XD subsequent encounter\n\nW61.49XS sequela\n\n\nIf you\u2019ve seen TV ads about the need to prepare for a bright new career in medical billing and coding \u2014 this is part of the reason why.\n\nOur ruling\n\nPoe said doctors face a new regulatory burden, requiring them to use a system that includes nine different codes for turkey injuries. His office pointed us to the new codes, which will be required for Medicare claims by October 2014. Indeed, if your Thanksgiving tradition takes a tragic turn that year, your doctor will be able to describe it in seven-digit detail. (We hope it\u2019s just W61.42XA and not W61.43XS.)
