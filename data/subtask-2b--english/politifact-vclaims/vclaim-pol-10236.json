Romney's plan goes into effect, it can mean that everyone -- every one of you -- would be paying more on taxes on your Social Security. The average senior would have to pay $460 a year more in tax for their Social Security.\"\n\nThe statement draws on an analysis by the Tax Policy Center, a joint project of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution that evaluates tax proposals submitted by presidential candidates.\n\nThe Obama campaign has used the study to make a number of claims about Romney\u2019s plan, at times leaping to a worst-case-scenario conclusion. Here, we\u2019ll check whether Biden\u2019s statement accurately reflects how Romney\u2019s proposal could impact Social Security benefits.\n\n Romney\u2019s tax proposal\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nRomney has not released a complete tax plan, but he has outlined some specifics on his campaign website. They include: cutting marginal rates by 20 percent on a permanent, across-the-board basis; eliminating interest, dividend and capital gains taxes for taxpayers earning less than $200,000; eliminating the estate tax; and repealing the Alternative Minimum Tax. He also has suggested these general guidelines:\n\n\u2022 The rate cuts would be paid for without adding to the deficit.\n\u2022 People at the high end \"will still pay the same share of the tax burden they\u2019re paying now.\"\n\u2022 Everyone would see tax rate reductions.\n\nRomney would also cut the corporate rate to 25 percent.\n\nTo offset those cuts, Romney has indicated that he would eliminate some common tax write-offs and deductions for people with high incomes, though he hasn\u2019t said which ones would go away.\n\nDigging into the plan\n\nKnowing all that, the Tax Policy Center study attempted to discern the effect of Romney\u2019s tax rate cuts combined with the elimination of several deductions such as the mortgage interest deduction, charitable giving deduction and the exclusion for health insurance.\n\nTo keep with Romney's guiding principles, the authors eliminated deductions and write-offs for top earners first. They determined that in order to reach the $360 billion needed to offset the rate cut, deductions would also have to be axed for people with incomes below $200,000. The effects of that were significant, the authors found. Many popular tax breaks are of greatest benefit to middle- and lower-income families, so eliminating them meant outright tax increases for everyone with incomes below $200,000.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThis is where Biden\u2019s Social Security claim comes in.\n\nCouples making less than $32,000 pay no taxes on their Social Security income. Those making between $32,000 and $44,000 pay taxes on 50 percent of Social Security, while those above $44,000 are taxed on 85 percent of their benefits.\n\nThe Obama campaign pointed out that in 2010, just over 29 million income tax returns were filed with untaxed Social Security and Railroad Retirement Benefits from individuals making $200,000 or less, for a total of about $29 billion in total benefits. So the average tax benefit was $987. Under Romney\u2019s plan, the value of the tax benefit would be reduced to $789, the campaign reasoned.\n\nThe Tax Policy Center study determined that 58 percent of middle-class taxpayers\u2019 deductions would have to be eliminated to make Romney\u2019s plan work. So by the Obama campaign\u2019s math, when deductions are cut by that much, the average tax benefit on Social Security income would be further reduced to $331, the equivalent of a $458 tax increase.\n\nThe problem with that math\n\nThe bottom line of the Tax Policy Center study is that Romney can't keep all his goals based on what is known of his plan. Unless some factors are tweaked, many middle-class taxpayers would end up paying more. Romney has said repeatedly he won\u2019t let that happen.\n\nIn addition, there are factors the study, admittedly, does not take into account. It doesn\u2019t factor in Romney\u2019s proposed spending cuts, or the expected economic growth that would result from the rate cuts and lead to greater revenues. In a Frequently Asked Questions fact sheet, the study\u2019s authors acknowledge that Romney\u2019s plan cannot be fully scored because it lacks detail. Their study, they said, examines the \"broad implications.\"\n\nThey also state directly that the study does not say Romney wants to raise taxes on the middle class.\n\n\"We said that simultaneously achieving all (of his tax goals) would result in lower taxes for high-income households and thus \u2013 because of the revenue-neutrality constraint \u2013 would require raising taxes on other households,\" the authors wrote.\n\nDonald Marron, the Tax Policy Center director, wrote on the center\u2019s blog, \"I don\u2019t interpret this as evidence that Gov. Romney wants to increase taxes on the middle class.\"\n\nAlthough Romney has not shown how he would pay for his rate cuts, he has said he will protect deductions for the middle class. His campaign has floated some vague ideas, such as capping the value of some deductions for high earners, which could be one way to keep the tax burden from increasing for those further down the income scale.\n\nOur ruling\n\nBiden said that under Romney\u2019s tax plan \"the average senior would have to pay $460 a year more in tax for their Social Security.\"\n\nThat figure is just one way to fill in the blanks in Romney\u2019s largely unexplained tax proposal. It\u2019s an average of a hypothetical, and it\u2019s at odds with what Romney has said he\u2019ll do, which is to protect deductions for the middle class and not raise taxes.\n\nBiden\u2019s comment leaps to several conclusions to arrive at the dollar figure he cites. We rate it Mostly False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the 2017 tax law, \u201cpeople who make under $75,000 will have their taxes raised in 2021 and every 2 years after that until 2027.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 February 5, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10236"}
