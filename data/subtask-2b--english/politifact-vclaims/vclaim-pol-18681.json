Roosevelt\u2019s 1937 proposal to expand the size of the Supreme Court \u2014 means increasing the number of justices on the court. Doing that would require legislation, and Biden has not said whether he\u2019d consider it as president. But Republicans are not currently pursuing that.\u00a0\nAs for the move to seat Barrett before the election, two constitutional scholars said that in a general sense, the Senate Republicans\u2019 actions\u00a0seem at odds with some of the democratic principles underlying the Constitution.\nBut the Republicans\u2019 move to add Barrett to the bench with a fast-paced confirmation process is not a violation of any specific clause in the Constitution, legal experts agreed.\n\"There is nothing unconstitutional about nominating a judge in an election year,\" said Saikrishna Prakash, a professor of law at the University of Virginia, in an email to PolitiFact. \"And there is nothing unconstitutional about giving consent to a president to appoint a judge (or justice).\"\u00a0\n\"In the modern era, whether to proceed on a nomination during (or after) an election year is wholly a matter of politics,\" Prakash said.\nNo specific clause in the Constitution outlaws this moment\nArticle II of the Constitution says that the president \"shall nominate, and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, shall appoint \u2026 judges of the Supreme Court.\"\nThe Constitution doesn\u2019t spell out procedures for nominating justices, nor does it require that the high court stay at a certain size. The number of seats on the Supreme Court is determined by legislation and has changed over the years. It has been set at nine justices since 1869.\nA handful of historical precedents and informal rules have been cited for the handling of election-year Supreme Court nominations, but they carry no official force.\u00a0\n\nSupreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett sits before a confirmation hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Oct. 13, 2020, at Capitol Hill in Washington.

Levy Center for Constitutional Studies.\n\"If \u2018unconstitutional\u2019 means that a court would find what the Republicans are doing to be inconsistent with the Constitution, the answer is no, no court would make such a holding,\" added Mark Tushnet, a professor of law emeritus at Harvard Law School.\nThe Biden campaign says he was talking about constitutional principles\nBiden did not elaborate on his claim when he made it. He previously accused Republicans of \"denying the American people the one shot they have, under constitutional law, to be able to have their input,\" according to the Associated Press.\u00a0\nKate Bedingfield, Biden\u2019s deputy campaign manager, made a similar point when CNN\u2019 Jake Tapper pressed her on Biden\u2019s claim about the Republicans\u2019 move being \"not constitutional.\"\nCNN\u2019s @jaketapper presses Biden\u2019s deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield on Biden\u2019s claim that confirming President Trump\u2019s Supreme Court pick before the election would be \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d pic.twitter.com/v4ny343qCv\u2014 State of the Union (@CNNSotu) October 11, 2020 \n\"Ramming through this nomination after millions of Americans have already voted is contemptuous of the essential democratic structure that is the bedrock of the Constitution,\" said Andrew Bates, the Biden campaign\u2019s director of rapid response, in a statement to PolitiFact.\nLaurence Tribe, a professor emeritus of constitutional law at Harvard University and a fierce critic of the Trump administration on Twitter, argued that Senate Republicans have run afoul of basic constitutional principles, even if there\u2019s no specific clause to condemn their actions.\n\"There is no anti-hypocrisy clause in the Constitution, but the hypocritical use of constitutional powers can undermine the presuppositions of a constitutional system,\" Tribe said.\nA fast-tracked confirmation battle so close to the election, for example, isn\u2019t honoring the principle requiring the consent of the governed, Tribe said. And the Senate\u2019s race to fill the newly vacant seat is an abdication of its duty to give meaningful advice and consent.\n\"This Senate is committed right now under the leadership of (Senate Majority Leader Mitch) McConnell not to give its advice and consent, but to give its rubber stamp,\" Tribe said.\nTushnet, also from Harvard, said that while no court of law would strike down the course of action Republicans are charting, \"what they are doing is inconsistent with what some people reasonably view as fundamental principles underlying the constitutional order\" \u2014 namely, the idea that \"the political system should operate over time to ensure that overall, all of our institutions are roughly in line with what the American people want.\"\nStill, what they\u2019re doing is not expressly prohibited by the language of the Constitution.\nThe requirement for the Senate to give its advice and consent \"is a political prerogative that duly elected senators can determine how to exercise,\" Shapiro said.\nOur ruling\nBiden said Senate Republicans\u2019 move to confirm Barrett to the Supreme Court in an election year is \"not constitutional.\"\nSome legal experts said the move to fast-track Barrett seems to conflict with some of the Constitution\u2019s basic underlying principles, such as the idea that there should be consent of the governed. But there is no clause in the Constitution that would prevent Senate Republicans from moving forward, legal experts said.\u00a0\nWe rate Biden\u2019s statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18681"}
