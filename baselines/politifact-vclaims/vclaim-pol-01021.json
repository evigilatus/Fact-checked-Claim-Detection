Amid the allegations, we found a suspicious Mueller quote that plays to some conspiracy theories around the probe.\n\"We must move as quickly as possible to a one-world government; a one-world religion; under a one world leader,\" a post published on Facebook on Feb. 11 reads.\nThe text appears above a picture of Mueller speaking. It was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

But after searching online, we couldn\u2019t find any legitimate sources that Mueller actually said it.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe did find several sources attributing the quote to someone with a similar name: Robert Muller, a former assistant secretary-general for the United Nations. The sources include a\u00a02013 Facebook post\u00a0and\u00a0books like \"On the Way to the Future: Daniel\u2019s Visions and the Believer\u2019s Hope,\" published in 2014 from author Ray Stedman, a pastor from California writing about biblical prophecies.\nPolitiFact couldn\u2019t confirm that Muller actually said this either. The United Nations did not immediately respond to questions about the quote\u2019s authenticity, and we did not find a credible citation.\nWhat does seem clear is that a quote attributed to Robert Muller (one \"e\") has been co-opted by detractors of Robert Mueller (two \"e\"s). But as far as we can tell, the special counsel never said it.\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire!\n Share the Facts 2019-02-14 18:58:50 UTC   PolitiFact    1 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Pants on Fire  Robert Mueller said, \"We must move as quickly as possible to a one-world government; a one-world religion; under a one world leader.\"     Viral image On the internet     Monday, February 11, 2019 2019-02-11    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01021"}
