This is one of the allegations that attracts attention in the announcement of a recent television attack and campaign courier by a group supporting Marshall Tuck, Thurmond's race opponent. The two Democrats are running for the post of State Comptroller of Public Education. Thormond is a member of the State Council representing Richmond, Berkeley and other communities in the Eastern Gulf and is supported by the Teachers' Union. Tak is a former Executive Director of Education supported by rented school groups. The incumbent, Tom Turlacson, will be named in January after serving two four-year terms. Many recent offensive announcements by each side, funded by tens of millions of campaign donations, have often turned a race under Rydar into a highly contested race. We wanted to know if there was evidence to support the claim that Thormond was \"produced by the American Freedom Association.\" Before our election to the state legislature, Thurmond was a member of the board of directors of the Unified West Contra Costa School, based in Richmond, from 2008 to 2012. The announcement of the television attack and the prosecution of the lawsuit refer to this period of the professional life of Thurmond. This is the full version of the Declaration: \"Before running for the post of Director of State, politician Tony Thurmond was responsible for a school district with wide-ranging budgetary problems. He was last ranked in the state because of his failure to serve colored students. He used to leave at-risk students in rotten trailers with mushrooms growing in the floor. The Obama Administration reprimanded for not addressing sexual harassment and abuse on a large scale in provincial schools. Tony Thormond failed the students he was supposed to help. California deserves better. \"Marshall Tuck supports a PAC declaration targeting Tony Thurmond, 2018 of EdSource on Femio. The announcement was made by the students, parents and teachers supporting Marshall Tak, an independent spending group established by Ed Voto, a non-profit organization supporting rented schools. During the voting, the announcement uses a large text that says: \"Tony Thurmund: replaces ACLU\" to convey this allegation, blurring the line between Thurmond and the school area. The campaign courier is less subtle, using bold letters saying: ACLU. Why did the D.A. write a law against Tony Thrummond? We agreed with the analysis carried out by Edsors, a non-profit educational news group, on this misleading nature of this claim: \"The announcement that Thormond was prosecuted for school facilities is technically accurate, in that he was named a member of the Board of Directors of the defendants in the lawsuit initiated by the American Civil Liberties Union against West Contra Costa Unit. However, each member of the school board, together with the district, is designated by the court as her supervisor and supervisory partner. The day-to-day administration of the province rests on its administration, not on the elected members of the Governing Council.\" On January 28, 2021 in Facebook blog, bloggers tried to \"close\" the California government's summoning campaign. \u2219 (Gavin Newsom) By Chris Nichols \u2022 On February 2, 2012, Thermond is rich because of the problems mentioned in the June 2012 lawsuit, giving the wrong impression. He served on the Board during the period mentioned in the case, but was not directly responsible for the circumstances. Abdi Soltani, Executive Director of the Federation Foundation in Northern California, wrote in a letter to Ed Voto that the Foundation, not the National Union, had filed an application. My Sultan added that the institution had nothing to do with the campaign correspondent and did not support the candidates. Ed Voto's spokesman referred to a website created by the independent spending group that supports Tuck. It repeats the same allegations in the television announcement and contains a link to the judicial proceedings. But it does not link Thormond directly to any of the unsafe conditions. When we asked Thormond about the television campaign and the postcard, she referred to groups and individuals from the National Alliance for the Chinese People to the United States, Sun Kamala Harris and the Mayor of San Francisco London Post, who all called for allegations. In verifying the relevant facts, we classified the false allegation that Thormond was \"repeated by the Obama administration.\" In fact, the Federation Foundation in Northern California filed a lawsuit in 2012 against the Unified School District in Western contra Costa on unsafe school conditions. All five members of the District Council, including Thurmond, were named in the lawsuit, along with the District Directors. However, the lawsuit does not directly link Thormond to any of the conditions of the school, which is run daily by directors and not by members of the board of directors. By focusing only on Thurmond, the campaign courier and the text of the television announcement distort the facts, giving the wrong impression was the sole objective of the lawsuit and uniquely responsible. This is simply not the case. We evaluated the claim for error. - The statement is not accurate. Click here for more of the six Polic Fact classifications and how we choose the facts to verify them.
