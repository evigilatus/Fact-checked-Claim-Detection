McGlover on charges of five counts of arson to wildland. (The amount of fires linked to McGlover was later upped to nine.)\nOne of the fires McGlover was accused of setting became the Cranston Fire, which destroyed multiple buildings, forced thousands of evacuations, and burned over 13,000 acres before it was fully contained.
