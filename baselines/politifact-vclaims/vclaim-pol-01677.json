The medications involved,\u00a0mifepristone and misoprostol, are sometimes referred to as abortion pills.\nBut those medication abortions won\u2019t be free, and they won\u2019t be available to \"all students across the state.\"\nThe bill involves public state universities and their student health centers \u2014 not high schools or private schools.\nThis story was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe majority of the Your News\u00a0Wire article was lifted from an opinion piece written by Lila Rose, the founder and president of the anti-abortion group Live Action,\u00a0known for creating \"sting\" videos targeting Planned Parenthood. This original column ran on WashingtonExaminer.com, a conservative-leaning publication.\nYour News Wire changed the column\u2019s headline from \"California moving to mandate abortion pills on campus\" to the more inclusive and incorrect \"California to supply free abortion pills to all students.\"\nWe contacted the article's author, Sean Adl-Tabatabai, and the article was deleted from the site within minutes.\n\"Since being alerted to this we have decided to completely remove the article from our website as we cannot substantiate the claims made,\" Adl-Tabatabai\u00a0said in an email.\nHere's where their original reporting went wrong.\nWhat the bill says\nThe bill passed the state Senate in January. It hasn\u2019t passed the Assembly, as of Aug. 29.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf SB 320 becomes law, California would be the first state to mandate that medication abortions be available as part of basic university student health services. Only two universities surveyed in the 2015 American College Health Association PAP & STI Survey provided medication abortions at their health centers.\nThe University of Illinois at Chicago is one example. Its student health center started providing medication abortions in 2006.\nMedication abortions cost about $600 out-of-pocket, according to an August study\u00a0about the California measure that was published in the Journal of Adolescent Health. If provided on-campus, they would not be free, but the cost might be reduced.\n\"While it is not yet known how much students would pay for an on-campus medication abortion, the costs are likely to be the same or lower than those going to an off-campus clinic,\" the study stated.\nThose costs would be handled the same as other student health services, according to\u00a0Sergio Reyes, communications director for state Sen. Connie Leyva, who introduced the bill.\n\"Medication abortion services at student health centers could be paid for the way any other basic health care on campus is covered,\" Reyes said.\u00a0\"Some options that are available to student health centers are for them to bill Medi-Cal, charge a fee for service, cover it through student fees or by contracting with a community provider who comes to campus and handles the billing.\"\nInitial costs for preparing student health centers to administer medication abortions would be privately funded, according to the text of the bill.\nFrom those private funds, grants of up to $200,000 would be administered to student health centers to pay for the equipment and training needed to be able to perform medication abortions by 2022.\nSeparate $200,000 grants would fund telehealth services, services to bill insurance and Medi-Cal and a 24-hour hotline for people who have had a medication abortion at a student health center.\n\"SB 320 aims to have private grants pay for the cost to get each student health center ready to provide this service, but is not prescriptive in how each student health center decides to fund it on an ongoing basis,\" Reyes said. He added that student health centers are already responsible for covering all operating costs of th health centers, and that the only additional cost would be the medication, at approximately $60 to$70 dollars per pill.\nReyes said that a person seeking a medication abortion must first meet with a health care provider, who determines the age of the pregnancy.\nOur ruling\nThe Your News Wire headline said, \"California lawmakers are planning to push free abortion pills on all students across the state as part of a \u2018super progressive\u2019 new policy.\"\nWhile the California Legislature is moving toward mandating on-campus medication abortion services, that\u2019s quite a bit different than \"pushing\" abortion pills on \"all students across the state.\" The bill\u00a0only applies to college health centers.\nThe cost will not be free like the Your News Wire\u00a0headline states, but will be billed the same way as other college health services.
