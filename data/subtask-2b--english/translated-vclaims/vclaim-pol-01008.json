For decades, electoral maps in North Carolina have been criticized as biased against any party that controlled the legislature when mapping. Currently, the State faces four different legal challenges to its maps. So, the Republic (Chuck McGreedy), a Republican from Henderson County, hopes that the legislature will change its methods before redrawing the maps in 2021. On 13 February, Magradi submitted a draft law that would transfer responsibilities for the redistribution from the legislature to a non-political commission. Given that the State Council and the State Senate have been dominated by the legislators of the General Democratic Party since 2011, it may appear that the Republicans are not interested in the reform of the provinces. But that's not true, as McGreedy claims. \"At my gathering, nearly half of the Republicans who are now serving have voted for this kind of bill... or co-sponsored one or more party-redivisional bills,\" said McGradit on Wednesday during a press conference. There are currently 65 Republicans in the House of Representatives. In order for McGradit &apos; s claim to be true, some 33 of them needed to have previously supported a draft law on redistribution. How close is McGurdy? If we are talking about Republicans in the House of Representatives who supported the bills before 2019, McGurdy comes for a rather short time - something I realized when Paulette called him a fruit. McGradie said he got his information from Bob Phillips, CEO of Joint Case. McGradit made a mistake in counting the number of legislators who had already supported a non-partisan redistribution, as he said in an e-mail. \"I didn't realize that I was making some members twice because they were included as a vote for a bill and co-sponsored one or more bills,\" said McGradit, referring to a list given to him. It is also important to note that the Republicans who have already supported the non-partisan redistribution bill will not necessarily support it this year. However, McGradie is not that far away. His predictions are approaching, but only because of the Republicans who are supporting his bill this year. Let's go down the memory path. One of the draft laws mentioned by McGradit at his press conference was the House Bill 824, which was introduced in 2011 and would have created a non-partisan redistribution process. Five current members of the House of Representatives were among the sponsors of the bill: Jenna Wadsworth, who was confirmed by the facts cited on 26 January 2021 in the North Carolina tweet by Secretary of State Ellen Marshall, \"She won state-wide races more than anyone else is likely to be alive.\" By Paul Specett of February 1, 2021 David Lewis of Harnett John Vervas County of Gilford Julia Howard of Davy Sarah Stevens of Surrey (Presiding Speaker of the Provisional House of Representatives) Harry Warren of Rowan. Ten others voted in favour of the bill at least once: Hugh Blackwell of Burke County, William Bryson of Bladen (which was democratic in 2011) George Cleveland of Unslo Jimmy Dixon of Doblin Craig Horn of the Pat Hurley Federation of Randolph Linda Johnson of Cabarros Pat McLraft of Cartwright. In 2013, a group of legislators from the two parties submitted another draft law on party redistribution. The bill, HB 606, has never been put to a vote. However, many Republican supporters of the 2011 Bill sponsored HB 606, as well as these other six Republicans: Jay Adams of Kataba County John Hardster of Gilford Jason Sen of Lincoln Phil Shepard of Unslo John Soska of Cumberland McGreedy, sponsor of the Bill. So far, that puts our number of supporters of the non-partisan redistribution in 21 Republicans. In 2015, OP 92 sought to form a non-partisan redistribution committee. It was never voted on, but many of the current Republicans supported it, including John Freely from Erdel County and Lee Zachary from Yadkin. A similar bill, HB 200, was introduced in 2017 and never voted on. Cody Henson of Transylvania was among a handful of Republican shepherds. According to our census, 24 members of the Republican Council supported non-partisan restructuring projects before this year. This leads us to 2019 and the bill that McGradit just introduced, HB69. Under the auspices of eight Republicans who were not already on our list: Jerry Carter from Rockingham County, Kevin Corbin from Macon Ted Davis from New Hanover Edward Goodwin from Chuan Holly Grange from New Hanover Bobby Haning from Curitok, Steven Ross from Alamans and Wayne Saser from Stanley County. (Goudwin, Hanig, Ross and Saser added their names to the bill after the McGradit press conference.) This means that as of 3 p.m. on Friday, 32 Republicans participated in the House of Representatives and sponsored or voted in favour of a party-redivision bill at some point. In addition, the Republic of the Republic signed a pledge with the NC Joint Case Party to support an independent, non-partisan re-divisional committee from Beit and Keith Kidwell District of Beaufort. McGradit said that nearly half of the Republicans in the House of Representatives had supported a non-partisan law on redistribution. Only 24 Republicans in the House of Representatives (about 37%) supported the party redistribution bill before 2019, which is not nearly half of the members of GOP 65. But when you think about supporting the Republicans with his new bill, he is absolutely right that almost half of the Republicans in the House of Representatives have supported the idea of party redistribution at some point. We're assessing this claim half right. This story was produced by the North Carolina Fact Review Project, a partnership from Maclachi Carolina, Duke University Reporter Laboratory and Fact Politics.
