Trump said, \"What I want to do differently is really get down hard on OPEC,\" referring to the oil-producing nation's cartel, including many in the Middle East, which is behind the recent rise in gasoline prices. \"If you look at these nations, they will not be there except for us. Take a look at Kuwait I mean, we handed Kuwait over to people who already own Kuwait, because it's really more property than anything else. We gave it to us. \"They never paid us.\" Trump was referring to the war in the Persian Gulf in 1991, when a United States-led military alliance led Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait after the Iraqi dictator invaded the rich small oil-producing empire. Is it really true that Kuwait didn't bother to pay us back after we bailed them out? Not at all. We moved on to the final report on the war submitted to Congress in 1992. According to the report, the United States was on the hook for the cost of more than 500,000 United States troops and associated equipment beyond what the military had to pay for normal non-war activities. But instead of shouldering this burden alone, the administration of President George H.W. Bush received financial pledges from his fellow members of the Alliance. The report states that these war costs, known as \"Additional Costs,\" were estimated at $61 billion. In 1990 and 1991, coalition nations committed approximately $54 billion to compensate for that cost - about two thirds of the Persian Gulf States directly threatened by invasion and one third of others, mostly Japan and Germany. By March 11, 1992, the United States had received almost all the funds pledged. In this context, there is a collapse, in descending order depending on the amount of pledges, according to a report submitted to Congress: Saudi Arabia: $16.8 billion pledged, $12 billion paid in cash and $4.0 billion paid in kind. Total payments: $16.0 billion from Kuwait: $16.1 billion in pledges, $16.015 billion in cash payments and $43 million in in kind. Total payments: US$ 16.1 billion: US$ 10 billion, US$ 9.4 billion and US$ 571 million. Total payments: Germany $10 billion: $6.6 billion pledged, $5.8 billion paid in cash, and $683 million paid in kind. Total payments: $6.5 billion from the United Arab Emirates: $4.1 billion in pledges, $3.9 billion in cash payments and $218 million in in-kind payments. Total payments: US$ 4.1 billion from South Korea: US$ 355 million from pledges, US$ 150 million from cash payments, US$ 101 million from in-kind payments. Total reimbursements: $251 million Total payments: $54 billion pledged, $47.3 billion paid in cash and $5.6 billion in kind. Total amount paid: $52.9 billion 1/ Of this amount, $48.4 billion was in cash and $5.7 billion in kind. So Trump was totally wrong that Kuwait never paid us. When the books were closed in the war, the United States found itself outside its pocket by about $7 billion - less than half of the $16 billion that Kuwaitis had hit. We evaluate his claim of pants on fire! On January 13, 2021, the distinguished fact-finding bloggers announced in a story in which General David H. Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for the use of marines for inaugural security, saying, \"We are not working for you.\"", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13186"}
