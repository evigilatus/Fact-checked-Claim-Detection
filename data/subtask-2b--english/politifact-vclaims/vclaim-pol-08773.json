We rated McAuliffe\u2019s claim Pants on Fire.\nThis time, we\u2019ll examine a Cuccinelli charge -- made in a radio ad -- that it\u2019s McAuliffe who\u2019s gung-ho for government gridlock. \u00a0\n\"He\u2019s already threatened to shut down Virginia\u2019s government if his budget plan isn\u2019t supported,\" the narrator says of McAuliffe.\nAnna Nix, a Cuccinelli campaign spokeswoman, told us the claim refers to McAuliffe\u2019s repeated vow that he won\u2019t sign a budget as governor unless it provides for Medicaid expansion. An additional 400,000 low-income Virginians would be eligible for the health care program next year under an Obamacare offering. \u00a0In the first three years the federal government would pay 100 percent of the new cost. After that, the share gradually declines to 90 percent, with the state paying the rest.\nVirginia lawmakers have not decided whether to expand the state\u2019s program, instead opting for a commission that will recommend efficiencies to Medicaid before a final choice is made.\nMcAuliffe says the state would be foolish to turn down the federal money. Cuccinelli and many Republican legislators oppose expanding Medicaid, saying Washington can\u2019t be trusted over the long term to pay its promised share.\nCuccinelli\u2019s spokeswoman noted that McAuliffe said in a June 1 dinner speech to Loudoun County Democrats, \"No budget gets done unless the governor signs that legislation. I will not sign a budget in Virginia unless the Medicaid expansion is included. \"\nMcAuliffe was quoted by the AARP on Aug. 29 saying he wouldn\u2019t sign budget that doesn\u2019t fund Medicaid expansion. During a Sept. 7 speech in Arlington, McAuliffe said, \"My opponent doesn\u2019t support the Medicaid expansion. I have asked the legislators `Please do not send me a bill\u2019 -- because the governor has to sign the bill for the budget to come into effect -- \u2018please don\u2019t send me a bill unless the Medicaid expansion is included.\u2019\"\nGrowing the program would certainly run into stiff opposition from Republicans in the General Assembly. But is McAuliffe\u2019s pledge not to sign a budget that excludes Medicaid expansion tantamount to a threat to shut down government?\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s dig deeper.\nIf a governor does not sign a budget bill that has been passed by the General Assembly, it automatically becomes law, according to A.E. Dick Howard, a University of Virginia law professor who helped draft a revised state constitution that voters adopted in 1971.\nHoward pointed to Article 5, Section 6 of the state constitution, which says if the governor receives a bill while the General Assembly is in session, he has seven days to sign, amend or veto the legislation, or it becomes law. If the governor receives a bill when the General Assembly is not in session, he has 30 days to act before the measure becomes law.\nAny budget amendments offered by a governor can be defeated by a majority vote in either chamber. Should the governor veto a budget, the legislature can override it with a two-thirds vote of each house.\nMcAuliffe says his budget-signing vow will never come into play if he becomes governor because he\u2019s certain he could convince a majority of legislators to approve Medicaid expansion.\n\"No budget will be shut down in Virginia over the Medicaid expansion,\" McAuliffe said during a Sept. 25 debate with Cuccinelli. \"I will work in a bipartisan way to get it done\u2026so we won\u2019t have any government shutdown.\"\nOur ruling\nCuccinelli says McAuliffe has threatened to shut down state government. He points to McAuliffe\u2019s repeated promise not to sign a state budget that does not allow for Medicaid expansion.\nBut McAuliffe\u2019s vow, if carried out, would not close Virginia\u2019s government. If a governor does not sign the budget, it automatically becomes law no more than 30 days after the General Assembly sent it to his desk.\nIt\u2019s striking that Cuccinelli, who has served almost four years as attorney general after an eight-year career in the state Senate, overlooked this constitutional provision.
