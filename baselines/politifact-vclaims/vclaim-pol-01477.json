Gillum says yes", "text": "Florida has experienced job growth during Republican Gov. Rick Scott\u2019s two terms, but the Democratic candidate looking to replace him questions the quality of those new positions.\nIn an interview on CBS Miami\u2019s \"Facing South Florida,\" host Jim DeFede asked Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum what he thought of Florida\u2019s economy.\n\"I give him credit for an economy that is largely propped up on low-wage work,\" Gillum said. \"Of course you've got a low unemployment rate when people have got to work two and three jobs just to make ends meet.\"\nIn a companion fact-check, we rated Gillum\u2019s claim that the low unemployment rate is due to people working multiple jobs Pants on Fire.\u00a0Here, we look at Gillum\u2019s first claim: that Florida\u2019s economy is largely propped up on low-wage work.\nLow-wage work\nFlorida does have a lot of low-wage workers.\nMoody's Analytics senior economist Kwame Donaldson said Florida has a slightly higher percentage of people working low-wage jobs compared with the rest of the country \u2014 36 percent in Florida, and 33 percent nationwide.\nFlorida is ranked 26th among all states for low-wage jobs, based on taking 279 private industries and separating them into thirds \u2014\u00a0low-wage, mid-wage, high-wage \u2014 according to their average wage at the national level. That's right in the middle of states.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2016, one in five Floridians were paid $10 or less an hour, according to the 2017 State of Working Florida report from Florida International University\u2019s Center for Labor Research and Studies.\nThe report shows that Florida lags the national trend of rising median wages. The state\u2019s 2016 median wage of $16.03 an hour was the lowest in 11 years.\n\"If Gillum\u2019s point is that this situation has gotten worse under Gov. Scott, then there is evidence in support of this claim,\" Donaldson said. \"The share of low-wage jobs in Florida has grown by two percentage points over the last eight years, the 10th-sharpest increase in the nation.\"\nIn an email, Gillum\u2019s campaign pointed to an article from the Gainesville Sun that highlighted the increase in low-wage jobs since the recession, indeed making that point.\nLow-wage jobs have accounted for nearly one in every two jobs created in Florida between 2005 and 2016, according to the 2017 State of Working Florida report. More than 392,000 of the 883,000 jobs created during this time paid $10 or less an hour.\n\nOur ruling\nGillum said that Florida\u2019s economy was propped up on low-wage jobs.\nWe found that some of Florida\u2019s job growth has been in low-wage jobs, and that the median wage level is the lowest in 11 years. However, there has been job growth in higher-paying jobs as well, and Florida is ranked 26th in low-wage jobs compared to other states.\nGillum has a point but additional context is needed.
