Frashour was initially fired after shooting an unarmed Campbell in the back, though a Multnomah County grand jury had found no criminal wrongdoing. The case then went to an arbitrator who heard \u00a0training officers testify that Frashour acted as trained.\n\nThe city is fighting that determination and the controversy over the policy and Frashour\u2019s actions has stayed hot.\n\nIn a small Twitter dust up, one user (@nextchampjr) asked Mayor Sam Adams if he thought the federal standard for use of force, which the arbiter found Frashour met, ought to be reworked. The mayor replied that, in fact, \"Portland has higher standards than feds on allowed police use of force.\"\n\nWe wondered whether that was accurate.\n\nBefore we get to our analysis, we note that we\u2019re staying out of the debate over how Frashour was trained, and how well. We are only examining the policy.\n\nFirst, we needed to establish the generally accepted federal standard. Such a standard exists, \u00a0but not in quite the way you might expect. There\u2019s no series of agreed-upon federal guidelines that lay out exactly what sort of force can be used in a specific instance. Instead there\u2019s a legal term called the Graham Standard or the Objective Reasonableness Standard.\n\nBack in 1989, the United States Supreme Court ruled in Graham v. Connor that any questions regarding the use of force should be held to the Fourth Amendment rules of \"reasonableness.\" Essentially, this means that any use of force should be such that it would be deemed necessary by \"a reasonable officer.\"\n\n\"When we say reasonable, it's an objective standard,\" explains Tung Yin, a criminal law professor at Lewis and Clark. \"You judge it from the perspective of the reasonable officer on the scene.\"\n\nThis caused some controversy at the time the case was decided because whether you perceive force as reasonable in the heat of the moment -- which is the standard -- is often different than how you perceive it after the fact, Yin said.\n\nSo, how is Portland\u2019s policy different? Caryn Brooks, the mayor's spokeswoman, pointed us to Portland Police Policy 1010.20. According to that policy, adopted by former Police Chief Rosie Sizer, officers should use \"only the force reasonably necessary under the totality of circumstances to perform their duties and resolve confrontations effectively and safely.\"\n\nThat piece just gets the bureau in line with the legal standards. But the policy also adds these two pieces of direction:\n\n1) \"It is the policy of the Bureau to accomplish its mission as effectively as possible with as little reliance on force as practical.\"\n\n2) \"The Bureau expects members to develop and display, over the course of their practice of law enforcement, the skills and abilities that allow them to regularly resolve confrontations without resorting to the higher levels of allowable force.\"\n\nYin described this text as more \"aspirational text, rather than any sort of legal requirement\" but said he felt the mayor\u2019s characterization was accurate.\n\nWe agree with Yin. We rate this claim True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMary Nolan\n\n\nstated on September 21, 2011 in campaign literature\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays she helped lead the launch of curbside recycling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Janie Har \u2022 October 1, 2011", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10246"}
