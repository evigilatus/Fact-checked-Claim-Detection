This week in Brussels, a summit was held with those countries for which he was not satisfied. One point of the talk has emerged over and over again. When he left the White House for Europe, Trump said that the United States was paying 90 per cent of NATO along with other member countries that were lagging far behind. In a short speech before he boarded his plane, he repeated his frustration but reconnected with the size of the United States share, saying: \"We spend at least 70% on NATO.\" On July 12, 2018, a press conference before he left Brussels, Trump decided to use both numbers to describe the unbalanced contribution of the United States: \"I believe in NATO. I think NATO is very important, perhaps the greatest action ever. But the United States was paying anywhere from 70 to 90 per cent of it, depending on your method of calculation. This is not fair to the United States.\" Notwithstanding the figure used, it is not correct to say that the United States pays either 70 or 90 per cent of NATO's military defence. The United States outstrips other defence countries by reviewing the first NATO budget report for 2017. (The projected 2018 defence expenditure report was released after Trump's initial suspension, but this does not change the facts surrounding the claim. The figures for 2017 show data on defence spending for all member countries from 2010 to 2016 and in the estimates for 2017. At NATO &apos; s expense, the total defence spending of all NATO members was approximately $957 billion in 2017. The United States share was about $686 billion. Do the math, and the percentage of American spending is about 72 per cent. (We don't know the source of the 90 percent.) Here are the first four countries to spend on the NATO list: country spending by billions (2017) per cent of total defence spending by NATO member States by the United States of America, US$ 71,686.7 per cent, US$ 55.8 per cent, and 5.8 per cent of distinguished bloggers to verify the facts mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Trump Act of Insurgencies - General Flynn's appointment as Vice-President.\" By Samantha Buterman: 11 January 2021, France 46.8% Germany 45.4% US spending not all of NATO, but what do these numbers mean? Expenditure does not represent funds spent on behalf of NATO, nor on NATO. This is the total defence budget of NATO members. For 2017, the total defence spending of all NATO members was approximately $957 billion. The United States spent $686 billion on all its defence spending worldwide that year. Jordan Adams, an honorary professor at the International Service School of the American University, said that the President's wording was \"weird,\" since the burden of defence was quite different from that of the United States and European States. \"American defense missions are global, not just European,\" he said, \"while allies spend only on European defence.\" American defence spending supports Pacific carriers, as well as troops in Europe. Moreover, Adams said that American equipment and personnel in Europe, such as an invisible F-35, could be deployed to missions in the Middle East. There is no clear way to stir up part of American defence spending that protects Europe in the first place. How countries finance NATO with things they call NATO. There are civilian personnel, headquarters and military equipment such as surveillance aircraft. There are bases, headquarters and a programme to strengthen military capabilities in some countries above and beyond what they need to defend themselves. Each of the 29 members contributes to these costs through an agreed cost-sharing formula based on the country &apos; s GDP. As the largest member of GDP, the United States contributed 22 per cent of NATO co-financing. Germany did not delay significantly, at about 15 per cent, followed by France and the United Kingdom at about 10 per cent. With the combined costs of about $2.5 billion in 2017, the United States share of about $550 million does not change the picture, with Europe &apos; s share being much more than $1.8 billion. This gap only weakens Tramp's argument. Our Governor Trump said, \"The United States was paying anywhere from 70 to 90 percent of NATO.\" It is not correct to say that the United States pays most of the costs of NATO. The United States pays 22 per cent of the NATO Common Fund. In addition to that relatively small amount, the cost of NATO is not specified. The organization has total defence budgets for its members and, accordingly, US defence spending is about 70 per cent. But the United States spends as much as it does because it is a global military force, which the European members generally do not. It's a comparison of apples and oranges. Trump paid a more flawed comparison by saying that the United States paid up to 90 per cent of NATO. This goes beyond overestimating the statistics we've seen before. The Trump statement contains only one element of the right, ignoring critical facts that give a different impression. We mostly rate it wrong.
