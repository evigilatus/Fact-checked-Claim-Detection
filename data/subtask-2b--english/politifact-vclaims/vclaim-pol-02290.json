He was transferred there in April 2017 following his federal death sentence, according to news reports.\n\nOther issues abound in this fake item. The fake post purports to link a to a video \u2014 but no such video exists on the site. The headline also misstates the number of victims. (Roof killed nine parishioners, not 14.)\nA similar fake news item was debunked by our friends at Snopes in 2016. Snopes reported that the phony conspiracy theory about Roof being raped in prison originated in July 2015 on the fake news website NYMeta, and has continued in various forms and outlets since then.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are a couple possible reasons why this hoax persists.\nFor starters, the idea of retribution against Roof may appeal to readers\u2019 desire for justice for one of the deadliest hate crimes in U.S. history.\nThe story\u2019s staying power may also have something to do with the fact it shares some similarities to an actual news story, albeit one with important differences.\nIn August 2016, Roof was reportedly beaten while being held at the Charleston County jail. The assault \"left Roof with minor bruises,\" but there is no evidence that the mass shooter was the victim of sexual assault.\nThe fake news item also claims Roof was assaulted while being escorted to the shower unit. However, the assault against him in August 2016 occurred after an unlocked cell door allowed an inmate to approach Roof.\nOur ruling\nBloggers said Charleston church shooter Dylann Roof was raped and beaten in prison.\nThere are a number of factual errors with this story. Roof has not been housed in Charleston \u2014 where the purported assault happened \u2014 since April 2017. The item also misstates the number of parishoners Roof killed.\nDespite being previously debunked, this hoax continues to persist.\nWe rate this Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02290"}
