But such sweeping statements often oversimplify the issue.\nLightfoot\u2019s claim, it turns out, is no exception.\nDefine \"most taxed\"\nLightfoot said Chicagoans live in one of the most taxed cities and the most taxed county, but what she appears to have meant was that Chicago residents are the most taxed because they have to pay high Cook County taxes on top of high city levies.\n\"Taxes and fees in Chicago and Cook County are forcing low-income families like the one I grew up in out of this city,\" Lightfoot said in a statement emailed to us by her campaign. \"It\u2019s clear we can\u2019t keep treating low-income and middle-class families like an ATM machine with no limit.\"\nTo back that up, Lightfoot pointed to more than 300 different fees the city can impose on residents, hefty property taxes and a combined sales tax rate of 10.25 percent on most retail purchases in the city.\nBut ranking tax burdens is a far more complex exercise than Lightfoot seems to suggest. Take that Chicago sales tax rate, which indeed is one of the highest in the nation. What the number doesn\u2019t take into account, however, is that Illinois, and by extension Chicago, applies the sales tax more narrowly than do many other places in the nation with lower rates.\nHere, few services are taxed. What\u2019s more, purchases of groceries and drugs are taxed at a steep discount, meaning the high general rate alone doesn\u2019t guarantee Chicagoans pay more in sales taxes.\nRon Alt, a research economist with the Federation of Tax Administrators, said it\u2019s important to account for both state and local taxes to accurately determine where people pay the most overall. Evaluating local taxes in a vacuum can be misleading, he said, because some states take on more of the cost of local functions than others, allowing municipalities to lower their taxes.\nIllinois is among the states that pick up less, leaving local property taxpayers to shoulder the lion\u2019s share of public education costs, which contributes to higher local taxes here.\nRichard Auxier, a research associate with the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, added that Chicago should be judged against other large cities given the scope of its economy and the scale of public services it provides. He also stressed the need to evaluate which residents bear the heaviest burden in any given municipality.\nWhat the research shows\nWith those factors in mind, we turned to a report produced annually by the government of Washington, D.C. that analyzes the combined state and local tax burdens residents at five different income levels face in each state\u2019s largest city as well as the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the 2017 tax law, \u201cpeople who make under $75,000 will have their taxes raised in 2021 and every 2 years after that until 2027.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat analysis shows Lightfoot has a point \u2014 but only when it comes to low-income Chicagoans.\nA hypothetical Chicago family consisting of two working parents and one school-aged child earning $25,000 faces the fifth-highest tax burden among those 51 jurisdictions. A similar family earning $50,000, meanwhile, pays the 10th-most in major taxes.\nBut as the income of Chicago taxpayers increases, their burden declines relative to that of similar earners in other large cities. Chicago families making $75,000 and $100,000 both pay the 16th-highest taxes, while families earning $150,000 rank 22nd among their counterparts.\nCompare that to New York, where lower income earners pay taxes that put them in the middle of the pack nationally, while families that earn more occupy the fifth-highest spot compared to their peers. But that may say more about state than city tax policy because tax deductions offered to New York state residents are far more generous than similar benefits for Illinois taxpayers.\nState constraints on the kind of taxes local governments can levy also play a role. Counties in Indiana, for instance, tack on local income taxes to the state rate, but the Illinois Constitution bars local income taxes.\nIn Marion County, home to Indianapolis, the combined rate for individuals is 5.25 percent, higher than Illinois\u2019 4.95 percent income tax. That helps explain why the D.C tax study shows the burden on low-income families in Indianapolis is nearly as steep as in Chicago even though nominal tax rates in Indiana are considerably lower.\n\"It\u2019s difficult because we want to assess the (local) policy makers on their policy choices, but all of these things work together,\" Auxier said.\nThe D.C. analysis requires a few other disclaimers, but they don\u2019t do much to advance Lightfoot\u2019s case.\nThe study uses tax rates in effect in 2016, before Illinois raised its flat income tax from 3.75 percent to 4.95 percent. Auxier, however, said that increase wouldn\u2019t be likely to have a major effect on Chicago's rank. And while the report accounts for state and local income taxes, property taxes, sales taxes and auto taxes, it doesn\u2019t cover the myriad fees Lightfoot referenced.\nThe Urban Institute has found such charges account for a greater share of local government revenue on average than local sales and local income taxes combined, though the analysis doesn\u2019t break costs down by particular cities. And it\u2019s important to note that Lightfoot contended Chicagoans were among the most taxed, not that they paid the most in fees.\nOur ruling\nLightfoot said, \"we live in one of the most taxed cities and the most taxed county, unfortunately, in the country.\"\nBy that, she meant Chicagoans are among the most taxed because they pay high county and city taxes.\nIt\u2019s clear the tax burden in Chicago is punishingly regressive, taking a bigger bite out of the overall incomes of poorer residents than the wealthy. That\u2019s a byproduct of not only local but state tax policy.\nSo Lightfoot would have been correct had she claimed that low-income Chicagoans are some of the nation\u2019s most taxed. And her broader comments do suggest those residents were the focus of her concern.\nInstead, she made a blanket statement that plays straight into a common but misleading narrative that all in Chicago pay punishingly high taxes.\nWe rate her claim Mostly False.\n\nMOSTLY FALSE \u2013 The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.\n Share the Facts 2018-12-03 14:57:55 UTC   PolitiFact    3 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly False  Says Chicagoans \"live in one of the most taxed cities and the most taxed county, unfortunately, in the country.\"    Lori Lightfoot Mayoral candidate    in a debate appearance Monday, November 19, 2018 2018-11-19    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01228"}
