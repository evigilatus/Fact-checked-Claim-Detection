So to defend Donald Trump\u2019s policies on immigration, vice presidential nominee Mike Pence went on the attack against Hillary Clinton\u2019s policies.\nOn NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, moderator Chuck Todd asked Pence about Trump\u2019s policies to ban Muslims from entering the United States. In recent weeks, Trump has said he would ban Muslims from countries with terrorist activity.\nWhen Todd pressed Pence about what countries those would be, Pence changed the subject to Clinton\u2019s Syria policy.\n\"Well, Hillary Clinton wants to increase Syrian refugees to this country by 550 percent,\" Pence said. \"Donald Trump and I believe that we should suspend the Syrian refugee program.\"\nPence added that their preferred policy is to work with Arab countries to establish safe zones closer to Syria.\nWe wanted to look at Pence\u2019s claim that Clinton\u2019s policy is for 550 percent increase. That number is accurate for now.\u00a0\nSyrian refugees by the numbers\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is\u00a0the international agency that tracks and promotes refugee resettlement around the world. Its current count of people who have fled the civil war in Syria, which started in 2011, is 4.8 million.\nMany of those 4.8 million refugees are in neighboring countries such as Turkey, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon. Due to overcrowding and the large number of overall refugees, the UN has called on other countries around the world to accept more Syrians for resettlement.\nPresident Barack Obama agreed on behalf of the United States to accept 10,000 refugees for \u00a0fiscal year 2016. The number was reached on Aug. 29, 2016, and the UN hailed the milestone in a press release.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We thank the communities in the United States that have kept their doors open and also our civil society partners for their tireless humanitarian efforts. Much more needs to be done for Syrian refugees and for the global crisis that has seen more people flee persecution than at any time ever recorded,\" said Shelly Pitterman, UNHCR regional representative in the United States.\nThe agency reported that around 478,000 Syrians are in need of resettlement, and Syrians make up about 40 percent of all refugees worldwide who need resettlement.\nIn September 2015, Clinton had called the 10,000-figure for the United States a good start but had urged an increase up to 65,000. Clinton said then the United States should be \"looking to really emphasize some of those who are most vulnerable, a lot of the persecuted religious minorities, including Christians, and some who have been brutalized, like the Yazidi women.\"\nThat 65,000-figure is a 550 percent increase from the 10,000 that Obama supported.\nIt\u2019s important to note, however, that those numbers applied to fiscal year 2016, which ends by Oct. 1, 2016. Clinton has not discussed numbers for the next fiscal year. So it\u2019s possible that 550 percent number may soon be out of date.\nWe should also note that there is a screening process for refugees. The UN identifies and screens refugees before they are referred to a country for resettlement. U.S. security agencies, such as the Department of Homeland Security, then conduct multiple security checks.\nOur ruling\nPence pointed\u00a0to a real policy distinction between the Republican and Democratic presidential nominees when he said that Clinton \"wants to increase Syrian refugees to this country by 550 percent.\" Trump is opposed to refugee settlement, while Clinton supports it, and at a greater number than Obama\u2019s current policy. Clinton supported allowing in 65,000 refugees when Obama supported a 10,000 figure. (The refugees would be screened.) That\u2019s a 550 percent increase. The UN has determined that about 478,000 Syrian refugees are in need of resettlement.\nThe statement is accurate and we\u00a0rate it\u00a0True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f5c92c56-bd8d-4a39-b2c5-58a7fed58505", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04372"}
