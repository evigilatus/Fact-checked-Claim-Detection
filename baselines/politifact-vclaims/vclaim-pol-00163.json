Gov. Tony Evers, a fellow Democrat, has threatened to call a special session on the matter if Republican legislative leaders don\u2019t take up the bill.\nThis comes as 80% of state residents support universal background checks \u2014 including 75% of gun owners \u2014 according to a Marquette University Law School Poll conducted in mid-August.\nSo how is that different from what Wisconsin has now?\nThe state\u2019s Democratic attorney general offered an example.\n\"Because we don\u2019t have universal background checks, people who are a danger to others \u2014 including people who have been convicted of a dangerous felony or are subject to a domestic violence restraining order \u2014 currently can buy a firearm without going through a background check,\" Josh Kaul said in an Aug. 15, 2019, tweet.\nState Sen. Jennifer Shilling, D-LaCrosse, raised the same point with a tweet earlier that day.\nCan someone in those circumstances really purchase a gun without a background check?\nMost gun buyers go through a background check\nA convicted felon, or someone with an active restraining order connected to domestic violence, would not pass a criminal background check to qualify for a firearm purchase.\nSuch background checks are required under federal law for any purchase of a firearm from a Federal Firearm Licenses dealer \u2014 which would include any retailers or others engaged in gun sales as a profession.\nIn Wisconsin, the state Department of Justice handles background checks for handgun sales, while long gun sales go through the National Criminal Background Check Systems, said DOJ spokeswoman Gillian Drummond.\nThis two-pronged system covers the \"vast majority\" of firearm purchases in the state, Kaul said in an\u00a0Aug. 9, 2019, appearance on Wisconsin Public Television\u2019s \"Here and Now.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the process gun rights advocates refer to when noting background checks already exist.\u00a0\nBut it\u2019s not the only way to buy a gun.\nPrivate sales treated differently\nA 2015 study found 22% of gun owners bought their most recent firearm without going through a background check.\nThat\u2019s because gun sales in Wisconsin between private parties (those without a federal firearms license) aren\u2019t subject to reporting, waiting period or background check requirements.\nThe U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives does not regulate private sales as it does those involving dealers. And Wisconsin is one of 29 states that does not impose any state-level regulations either, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a research and advocacy organization that seeks \"laws, policies, and programs proven to save lives from gun violence.\"\u00a0\nWebsites such as Armslist \u2014 a Craigslist-style firearms marketplace \u2014 connect private sellers and are heavily used. A search in September 2019 showed more than 2,000 firearms for sale from private parties in Wisconsin.\n\nTwo guns used in high-profile shootings here were purchased through Armslist by people under court orders not to possess guns.\nIn October 2012, Radcliffe Haughton killed three people including his estranged wife and injured four others, before killing himself at Azana Salon & Spa in Brookfield. A day before the shooting he purchased a .40-caliber handgun in the parking lot of a Germantown McDonald\u2019s after connecting with the seller on Armslist. Two days before that, a judge had issued a restraining order that barred Haughton from owning a gun.\nIn January 2018, Robert Schmidt bought a Glock 9 mm handgun from a 19-year-old man through Armslist, days after he was released from the Calumet County jail on a bond that prohibited him from having a gun. The transaction took place in a Walmart parking lot. Schmidt\u00a0was charged at the time with raping his wife at gunpoint. The next night he used that gun to\u00a0kill his wife and then himself at a home just outside Appleton.\nOur ruling\nKaul said felons and people subject to domestic abuse restraining orders are currently able to buy guns in Wisconsin without going through a background check.\nAll purchases from firearms dealers are subject to state and federal requirements that include a criminal background check. But Kaul is right that Wisconsin is among the states with no oversight of gun sales between private parties.\nThat has allowed people in the circumstances he described to buy guns, in some cases with tragic results.\nWe rate this claim True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00163"}
