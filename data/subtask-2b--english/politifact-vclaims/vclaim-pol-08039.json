There\u2019s a quick, penalty-free fix for anyone who wants out of Obamacare\u2019s health insurance requirement, says conservative pundit Charles Krauthammer.\nJust check a box. The one that says \"hardship.\" That\u2019s it, you\u2019re done! There will be no questions, and no consequences.\nAt least, that\u2019s how easy Krauthammer made it sound during his April 1 appearance on The O\u2019Reilly Factor. He and host Bill O\u2019Reilly discussed the Democrats\u2019 changes to the law since it passed in 2010.\nKrauthammer: \"They decide what the law is every Wednesday morning. They've changed it 38 times. The employer mandate is out. Remember the great debate in the country for two years over the individual mandate?\n\"The individual mandate no longer exists. They haven't said so officially, but if you want out of the individual mandate, do you know what you've got to do?\n\"You have to say that this is a hardship. There are hardship exceptions. It means, it was meant to mean, if there's a hurricane or a tornado and you're living out of the back of a pickup truck, you can opt out. All you have to do now is tick off the box that says 'hardship'\u00a0and you're out.\"\nO'Reilly: \"Yes, you don't even have to explain it.\"\nKrauthammer: \"You don't have to explain --\"\nO'Reilly: \"And it can be as simple as 'I don't know how to work the computer, so I can't get it.' \"\nKrauthammer: \"Right. When you have an anonymous bureaucratic computerized system and then you use the word 'honor system'\u00a0as the way of describing, you are deliberately misusing the language.\"\nO\u2019Reilly: \"I think the evidence is overwhelming that you are correct.\"\nWith an assurance like that from O\u2019Reilly, we thought Krauthammer\u2019s point merited a second look. Is it really so easy to get out of the insurance mandate by claiming a hardship?\nWe know from a previous fact-check that the Internal Revenue Service cannot use the threat of jail time or property seizures to go after people who do not pony up the \"shared responsibility payment,\" or what\u2019s sometimes referred to as the \"tax\" for not having health insurance even though you can afford it.\nThat fee, which will be collected in 2015 for the filing of 2014 taxes, is 1 percent of annual income or $95 per person for the year, whichever is more expensive. The fee goes up every year.\nAlready, some people are exempt for reasons including religious beliefs, prisoners, Indian tribes, income being below the federal filing level, and undocumented immigrants.\nThe hardship exemption comes in when you don\u2019t fall into those categories but have a reason for not having health insurance and paying the fine. In most cases, it\u2019s because you can\u2019t afford it.\nGetting one is not as easy as checking a box.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s the application from the Health Insurance Marketplace, which spells out 14 categories for the hardship exemption. It also says what form of documentation (hello, proof) you need to attach in order to qualify.\nCategories that require some form of documentation include being evicted or declaring bankruptcy in the last six months; receiving a shut-off notice from a utility; the death of a loved one; a human or natural disaster caused substantial property damage; racking up unexpected costs taking care of a family member; applying for but not receiving Medicaid because the state of residence did not expand Medicaid access envisioned in the law;\u00a0and having medical expenses you couldn\u2019t pay in the last two years.\nThere\u2019s also a hardship category for people whose health plans were canceled and they find other options unaffordable.\nBeing homeless or suffering domestic abuse are the only categories that do not require some form of documentation.\nBut then there\u2019s the 14th category: \"You experienced another hardship in obtaining health insurance.\" Documentation should be submitted \"if possible.\"\nIs that the magical \"other\" category promising safe haven for people who don\u2019t want to pay the insurance penalty?\n\"Exemption 14 is broad, but not open ended,\" said Timothy Jost, a Washington and Lee University professor who has studied the law. \"My understanding is that it is meant to give (Health and Human Services) the discretion to take into account hardships not specifically listed.\"\nAn unlisted hardship would have to be in the spirit of the other categories, he said, and it would not be permanent, if it\u2019s granted at all. The Department of Health and Human Services will respond within one to two weeks to let someone know if more information is needed, the application says. If the exemption is okayed, the recipient gets a special number to include on his or her tax return.\n\"HHS could certainly deny a hardship exemption if there was insufficient documentation or explanation,\" Jost said.\nGail Wilensky, an expert on the law who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush, said Krauthammer\u2019s point isn\u2019t that far from the mark, especially since \"the administration has shown itself to be extremely 'flexible'\u00a0when it comes to any type of enforcement or timing thus far.\"\nStill, there is some explaining required. There\u2019s a box for applicants to describe how their hardship prevented them from getting health insurance, with exceptions for people turned down for Medicaid and health policy cancellations (which are proven by copies of a denial for Medicaid or notice of cancellation).\nPeople who submit hardship exemptions without really needing one should pay special attention to step three of the application. That\u2019s the part where you sign, under penalty of perjury, that your exemption claim is honest. Lying is a crime.\n\"Only people who have a true, factual basis for their claims should be advised to file,\" said Sara Rosenbaum, George Washington University health and policy professor.\nOur ruling\nKrauthammer said people who don\u2019t want to comply with the individual mandate should just \"tick off the box that says \u2018hardship\u2019 and you're out.\"\nHe is over-simplifying the process.\nIncluded in the hardship exemption application -- because there\u2019s an application, you don\u2019t just check a box on your tax form -- is a 14th category that reads kind of like \"other.\" It\u2019s meant to catch examples of hardship not delineated in the form. Documentation is requested if possible.\nAgain, claiming it doesn\u2019t mean you get it. You apply. And just because you ask does not mean you will receive.\nWe rate the claim Mostly\u00a0False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08039"}
