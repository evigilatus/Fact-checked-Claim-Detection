Here's what he said in a statement touting the bill, which would extend government funding by another week while also providing funds to the Pentagon for the remainder of the year.\n\n\"As I\u2019ve said throughout this process, since the spending binge in Washington is hurting job creation in this country, we\u2019re going to fight for the largest cuts possible \u2013 real cuts, not more smoke and mirrors,\" Boehner said in the April 5, 2011, statement. \"We\u2019ve made clear that Democrats\u2019 $33 billion proposal is not enough, and much of it is based on gimmicks. To make a positive impact on our economy, the cuts need to be significant, and they need to be real. Failing to make real cuts will send a signal to job creators that Washington is still not serious about getting government spending under control. \u00a0...\n\n\"We\u2019re not going to allow the Senate and White House to force us to choose between two options that are bad for America, whether it\u2019s a bad deal that fails to make real spending cuts, or accepting a government shutdown due to Senate inaction. We\u2019ve introduced a bill that includes $12 billion in cuts over the next week and funds our troops through the year. We may pass this to keep the government running if Democrats don\u2019t listen to the American people and get serious about cutting spending.\"\n\nAt issue is this line: \"We\u2019ve introduced a bill that includes $12 billion in cuts over the next week.\"\n\nIndeed, while the bill does include $12 billion in cuts, it also includes $7.6 billion in additional spending for the Defense Department -- a 1.5 percent increase over last year\u2019s level. (This news release from the House Appropriations Committee breaks down the numbers in the bill.)\n\nSo the net amount of cuts is $4.4 billion -- roughly one-third of the $12 billion figure Boehner cited in his statement.\n\nSteve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, an independent group that analyzes federal spending, considers the emphasis on the $12 billion figure misleading.\n\n\"Saying the continuing resolution cuts $12 billion while ignoring the $7.6 billion in defense adds is like saying you met your weight loss goals if you don\u2019t count your backside,\" Ellis quipped in an e-mail.\n\nWe asked Boehner\u2019s office for the speaker\u2019s perspective, but we did not hear back.\n\nWe find that Boehner, who decried budget \"gimmicks\" in his statement, is conveniently leaving out the spending increase and painting a misleading picture of the bill.\n\nBoehner\u2019s statement -- \"we\u2019ve introduced a bill that includes $12 billion in cuts over the next week and funds our troops through the year\" -- is carefully worded. The bill does include $12 billion in cuts to discretionary spending, and it does fund the Defense Department, as he indicated.\n\nBut we also think Boehner\u2019s artful wording suggests a much larger cut than the bill actually delivers when the additional defense spending is included. Using the net figure for spending reductions would have been a more accurate description. On balance, we rate Boehner\u2019s statement Half True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H.
