Let us pledge to each other that we can make America great again.\"\nReagan used the \"Let\u2019s Make America Great Again\" slogan in his 1980 presidential campaign. Did he say what the ad shows?\u00a0\nWe found that Reagan in a 1980 campaign speech spoke about immigrants\u2019 journey to America and of their contributions to society. The ad patched together what Reagan said about immigrants with his closing call for everyone to \"make America great again.\" The full speech wasn\u2019t just about immigrants, it narrated Reagan\u2019s grievances with Carter and the economy and Reagan\u2019s own vision for America.\nWe reached out to Becoming American Initiative, a conservative a 501(c)(4) nonprofit organization, via Twitter but did not hear back.\nBecoming American Initiative ad\nThe 30-second ad features Reagan\u2019s voice over video of him delivering a speech with the Statue of Liberty in the background. It includes black and white video of a crowd of people walking and of men doing construction work, as well as video in color of a man picking fruit, of a child at the border, and a photograph of people waving American flags at what looks like a naturalization ceremony.\nHere\u2019s a transcript of Reagan\u2019s words:\n\"Through this Golden Door has come millions of men and women. These families came here to work. Others came to America and often harrowing conditions. They didn\u2019t ask what this country could do for them but what they could do to make this refuge the greatest home of freedom in history. They brought with them courage and the values of family, work, and freedom. Let us pledge to each other that we can make America great again.\"\nA slide at the end of the video said: \"Immigrants Have Always Made America Great.\"\nWhat Reagan said\nThe Becoming American Initiative ad is based on a Labor Day, Sept. 1, 1980 campaign speech Reagan delivered at Liberty State Park in Jersey City, N.J. Reagan went on to beat Democrat Jimmy Carter in the November election.\nWith the Statue of Liberty in the background, Reagan paid tribute to immigrants, starting his speech by saying they came to America to work and helped build cities and \"incredibly productive farms.\"\nReagan twice said \"make America great again\": around the middle of the speech, when he spoke about what his administration will do; and toward the end of the speech, when he called on everyone to also \"make America great again.\"\nThe ad from Becoming American Initiative cut and patched together sentences. Below is a partial transcript of Reagan\u2019s speech, in bold are the words the ad highlighted.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Through this Golden Door, under the gaze of that Mother of Exiles, has come millions of men and women, who first stepped foot on American soil right there, on Ellis Island, so close to the Statue of Liberty.\nThese families came here to work. They came to build. Others came to America in different ways, from other lands, under different, and often harrowing conditions, but this place symbolizes what they all managed to build, no matter where they came from or how they came or how much they suffered.\nThey helped to build that magnificent city across the river. They spread across the land building other cities and towns and incredibly productive farms.\nThey came to make America work. They didn\u2019t ask what this country could do for them but what they could do to make this, this refuge the greatest home of freedom in history.\nThey brought with them courage, ambition and the values of family, neighborhood, work, peace and freedom. We all came from different lands but we shared the same values, the same dream.\nToday a President of the United States would have us believe that dream is over or at least in need of change.\nJimmy Carter\u2019s Administration tells us that the descendants of those who sacrificed to start again in this land of freedom may have to abandon the dream that drew their ancestors to a new life in a new land.\nThe Carter record is a litany of despair, of broken promises, of sacred trusts abandoned and forgotten. ...\nThis country needs a new administration, with a renewed dedication to the dream of an America -- an administration that will give that dream new life and make America great again! Restoring and revitalizing that dream will take bold action. ...\n\u00a0I want more than anything I've ever wanted, to have an administration that will, through its actions, at home and in the international arena, let millions of people know that Miss Liberty still \"lifts her lamp beside the golden door.\"\nThrough our international broadcasting stations -- the Voice of America, Radio Free Europe, and the others -- let us send, loud and clear, the message that this generation of Americans intends to keep that lamp shining; that this dream, that this dream the last best hope of man on earth, this nation under God, shall not perish from the earth.\nWe will instead carry on the building of an American economy that once again holds forth real opportunity for all, we shall continue to be a symbol of freedom and guardian of the eternal values that so inspired those who came to this port of entry.\nLet us pledge to each other, with this Great Lady looking on, that we can, and so help us God, we will make America great again.\"\nSeveral years later, Reagan signed into law the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA), also known as the Simpson-Mazzoli Act. The law allowed about 2.7 million people to get green cards \u2014 including people who had been in the United States since 1982 and special agricultural workers.\nOur ruling\nA Becoming American Initiative ad claimed Ronald Reagan said immigrants \"brought with them courage and the values of family, work, and freedom. Let us pledge to each other that we can make America great again.\"\nThe ad is based on a 1980 Labor Day campaign speech in New Jersey, where Reagan lauded immigrants\u2019 contributions, while also listing his grievances with Carter and his own vision for America.\nReagan didn\u2019t say immigrants \"made America great\" verbatim, but he did imply it. The ad cuts out some of Reagan\u2019s words to make the comments appear adjacent.
