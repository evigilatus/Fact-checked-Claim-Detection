The claim apparently originated on 4chan, an online message board that is a known source of online disinformation, hate speech and conspiracy theories.\u00a0\nThese posts were flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Three credentialed media organizations had visited the ballot canvassing operation at the Plum Gar Community Center in Germantown on Oct. 20.\nWhat does the video actually show? Karpinski said the worker was darkening an oval that had been filled in too lightly to ensure ballot scanners would recognize it, according to the Post. It\u2019s a protocol that has been in place since he started working for the election board in 2003 to try to ensure as many eligible ballots as possible are counted.\nWorkers are supposed to ask other volunteers or supervisors if they\u2019re unsure whether an oval needs to be darkened, a practice that\u2019s easier when canvassers sit next to each other. This year they\u2019re sitting 6 feet apart because of the coronavirus.\u00a0\nKarpinski said the worker \"followed the appropriate policies and protocols.\"\nWe rate these posts False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18752"}
