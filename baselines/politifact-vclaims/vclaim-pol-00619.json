Is she correct? We didn\u2019t hear back from her campaign, but we found data that supports the statistic.\nA look at the numbers\nThe main suicide data page at the website of the National Institute of Mental Health includes data for the suicide rate between 2001 and 2017 -- a 16-year span, but close enough for our purposes. The data was collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nTo analyze Klobuchar\u2019s statement, we used the national suicide rate -- that is, the number of suicides per 100,000 population -- rather than raw numbers of suicides, because using the rate factors out any increases that are simply due to population growth.\nIn addition, the CDC\u2019s numbers are \"age-adjusted\" -- a statistical process that evens out differences in the age of the population for better year-to-year comparisons.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyan Fournier\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Noah Y. Kim \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s what the data shows:\n\nThe rate went from 10.7 suicides per 100,000 in 2001 to 14.0 in 2017. That's an increase of 30.8%, making Klobuchar right on target\nWhy is the suicide rate rising so consistently?\nPart of the reason for the rise may stem from better reporting of suicides, following the implementation of CDC\u2019s National Violence Death Reporting System, said Carol W. Runyan, a professor of epidemiology and community and behavioral health at the Colorado School of Public Health.\nBut she added that researchers believe there are substantive reasons as well.\n\"It is probably a combination of things, including inadequate access to quality mental health care, increased access to guns -- which are the most lethal means of attempting suicide -- and drugs, as well as social factors that relate to depression,\" Runyan said.\nOur ruling\nKlobuchar said, \"We\u2019ve had a 30% increase in suicides in this country in just 15 years.\"\nBetween 2001 and 2017, the suicide rate rose by exactly 30.8%.
