Kevin O\u2019Toole claims some 9/11 hijackers used New Jersey driver\u2019s licenses to carry out terrorist attacks", "text": "Nearly 10 years after 19 hijackers took over four flights on the morning of Sept. 11, 2001, state Sen. Kevin O\u2019Toole wants to remind people of what some of those terrorists used to carry out the attacks: a New Jersey driver\u2019s license.\n\nO\u2019Toole (R-Essex) provided that history lesson in an Aug. 21 opinion piece in the Times of Trenton about the need for technology upgrades in the state\u2019s Motor Vehicle Commission. A computer failure in July affected commission offices and other state agencies.\n\n\"Updating the technological capabilities of the MVC is of critical importance and should not be used for political gain,\" O\u2019Toole wrote. \"As we near the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, we should not forget that some of the hijackers used New Jersey driver\u2019s licenses to board those aircraft.\"\n\nBut PolitiFact New Jersey found that the 9/11 hijackers did not have New Jersey driver\u2019s licenses. According to reports by the FBI and the 9/11 Commission staff, the hijackers had gathered driver\u2019s licenses and state identification cards from five states, but not New Jersey.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s explain the documents cited by O\u2019Toole as the basis for his claim.\n\nThe senator referred us to 13 documents, including news articles and columns. Two of the documents appear on websites of organizations focused on opposing illegal immigration, and two columns were written by conservative author Phyllis Schlafly. Another document appears on the website for Free Republic, which bills itself as the \"Premier Conservative Site on the Net!\"\n\nThe news articles included items published in the New York Times and the Philadelphia Inquirer.\n\nThe only government document cited by O\u2019Toole was a portion of the 9/11 Commission report, which states \"several (hijackers) also obtained new photo identification, first in New Jersey and then at the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles.\"\n\nBut that section only states hijackers obtained \"photo identification\" in New Jersey, not driver\u2019s licenses.\n\nA separate report entitled \"9/11 and Terrorist Travel,\" which was released in August 2004 by the commission\u2019s staff, provides a breakdown of the identification documents of the 9/11 hijackers.\n\nAccording to that report, the hijackers collectively obtained driver\u2019s licenses from Arizona, California and Florida, and state identification cards from Florida, Virginia and Maryland. Those same findings were presented in FBI reports in 2003.\n\nJanice Kephart, former counsel to the 9/11 Commission and an author of \"9/11 and Terrorist Travel,\" confirmed to PolitiFact New Jersey that it is wrong to claim any of the hijackers had New Jersey\u2019s driver\u2019s licenses.\n\nKephart suggested the misunderstanding about the driver\u2019s licenses may stem from the fact that some hijackers obtained USA identification cards in New Jersey. A USA identification card does not represent any state or the U.S. government, Kephart said.\n\n\"They don\u2019t mean anything,\" Kephart said in a phone interview. \"It\u2019s meant to be deceptive.\"\n\nLess than two years before the 9/11 Commission completed its work, the FBI had already debunked the myth about New Jersey driver\u2019s licenses being used on Sept. 11.\n\nThe story about the licenses became so widely accepted that the administration of former Gov. Jim McGreevey used the claim to boost support for its plans to overhaul the motor vehicle agency.\n\nBut in December 2002, the FBI said a lengthy investigation found no evidence that any of the hijackers had New Jersey licenses, according to a Star-Ledger article at the time. The McGreevey administration backed off from using the hijackers to tout its proposal.\n\n\"As a result of the discrepancies raised, we no longer have sufficient confidence to say that there were New Jersey driver\u2019s licenses involved,\" Eric Shuffler, chief of staff for state Transportation Commissioner Jamie Fox, said at the time.\n\nSome of the documents cited by O\u2019Toole were published before the Star-Ledger revealed the results of that FBI investigation -- and before the 9/11 Commission did its job.\n\nThe ruling\n\nIn an opinion piece about Motor Vehicle Commission upgrades, O\u2019Toole claimed \"some of the hijackers used New Jersey driver\u2019s licenses to board those aircraft.\" To back up his point, the senator provided various sources, some of which had a conservative bias and/or were published before the 9/11 Commission completed its investigation.\n\nBut the claim has been refuted by research done by the FBI and the 9/11 Commission. The 9/11 hijackers obtained driver\u2019s licenses and state identification cards from five states, but New Jersey wasn\u2019t one of them.\n\nWe rate the statement False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeremy \"Spike\" Cohen\n\n\nstated on January 22, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays the Biden administration labeled Libertarians terrorists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Czopek \u2022 January 22, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-12122"}
