Jimmy Anderson, elected in 2018, was paralyzed from the chest down in 2010 after a drunken driver collided with the vehicle he was traveling in, killing his family and permanently injuring him. The Democrat from Fitchburg uses a wheelchair to get around.\u00a0\nOn Aug. 14, 2019, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel posted a story that said all 36 Democratic members of the Assembly asked Vos and Republican leaders to allow Anderson to call in to meetings he can\u2019t attend in person, and make other adjustments to Assembly rules.\nThe accommodations, they said, fell under federal ADA requirements. The letter was dated Aug. 8, 2019. No Republicans signed it.\nAdditionally, Anderson and other Democrats have asked Vos to refrain from calling overnight floor sessions that aren\u2019t an emergency and that an ADA coordinator be assigned to determine which accommodation requests should be granted.\u00a0\nThe day after the story appeared, Vos told conservative radio host Jay Weber on 1130 WISN the timing of the request was fishy, since it aligned with his new position as president of the National Conference of State Legislatures.\u00a0\n\"The fact that they launched this during the same week I got to become the president of the nation\u2019s largest bipartisan organization called the National Conference of State Legislatures, first person from Wisconsin, does not seem like an accident to me,\" Vos told Weber on Aug. 15, 2019. \"Everything they do is political and based on trying to make the other side look bad.\"\nVos told Weber he felt that lawmakers phoning in to meetings was disrespectful, because they are paid to be present. Additionally, Vos said, you wouldn\u2019t be able to be sure they were really paying attention if they phoned in.\nVos has said Anderson could listen to recordings of hearings and meetings he may miss, but that he would not be able to phone into them so he could participate and vote.\nSo, Vos has claimed the accommodations request from Anderson and the Democrats was timed to embarrass him.\nWe decided to take a closer look at the timeline of what happened.\nThe timeline\nAnderson\u2019s office provided a Jan. 23, 2019, email that Anderson sent to the chief of staff for Minority Leader Gordon Hintz, D-Oshkosh, as the starting point.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat email, sent by Anderson at 12:55 p.m., asked that any meeting of the Assembly have 24-hour notice; that none extend beyond 24 hours; that all be held within reasonable hours; and that individuals with disabilities be allowed to attend by phone or teleconference.\nHere is a summary of what happened next:\nFeb. 7, 2019: Through a formal negotiation, or Memorandum of Understanding over rules for the session, Democrats bring the requests to Republican state leaders in further detail.\nApril 16, 2019: GOP leaders reject Anderson\u2019s request to call into sessions and meetings and that the Assembly recess no later than 10 p.m., reconvening the following day if debate went longer. Republicans say they would try to limit meetings to 12 hours and said if they were expected to go longer, would provide appropriate notice to members. This is based on a document outlining the negotiations provided by Anderson\u2019s office.\nMay 15, 2019: Democrats say the 12-hour parameters, and not allowing Anderson to call into meetings, do not address accessibility concerns.\nMay 31, 2019: Anderson contacts reporter Patrick Marley of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\u00a0\nMay 31, 2019: Marley asks Vos spokeswoman Kit Beyer what Vos thinks of lawmakers being able to call into meetings, if he would introduce a policy that allows it and, if not, why not.\nJune 4, 2019: Beyer responds to Marley saying Assembly rules don\u2019t allow members to phone into committees and Vos does not support changing the rule.\nJuly 29, 2019: The Journal Sentinel publishes a story that describes the dispute after Vos tells the newspaper he thinks it is \"disrespectful for someone to be asking questions over a microphone or a speakerphone.\"\nAug. 8, 2019: The Democrats send their letter to Republican leadership.\u00a0\nThat same day, Vos becomes president of NCSL.\nThe story about the Aug. 8 letter -- and a suggestion by Anderson that he may file a lawsuit -- was published a week later. That story is what prompted Vos\u2019 claim on the Jay Weber show that it was -- in essence -- a move timed to embarrass him.\nBut the timeline shows that Anderson\u2019s efforts began almost immediately after he took office in January 2019 -- nearly seven months before Vos took the post in question.\nVos\u2019 office did not respond to requests from PolitiFact.\nOur ruling\nVos claimed the accommodation request for Anderson was timed to embarrass him as he took over as president of the National Conference of State Legislatures.\u00a0\nBut records show the effort began months and months earlier.\nWe rate Vos\u2019 claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00218"}
