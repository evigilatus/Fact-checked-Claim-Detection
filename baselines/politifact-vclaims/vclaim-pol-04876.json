Joe Heck.\nAfter reading a Reagan quote about rabbits and tigers, Angle\u2019s ad accuses Heck of aligning with Democrats a majority of the time.\n\"Congressman Joe Heck has been a D.C. rabbit for the past five years, voting 62 percent of the time with Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats on a variety of important issues,\" Angle says in the ad.\nThe ad is certainly a provocative shot with Nevada\u2019s primary election quickly approaching and Angle trailing in polls, so we were interested in seeing just how often Heck ended up on the same side as the House\u2019s Democratic leader.\nScoreboards\nAngle\u2019s campaign referred to Heck\u2019s 39 percent \"Liberty Score\" ranking on the Conservative Review website as support for the ad. The group calculates the score though 50 \"top\" votes through a rolling six-year window.\nThe website hasn\u2019t been Heck\u2019s biggest fan, with the site\u2019s editor-in-chief Mark Levin endorsing Angle and releasing a video saying he \"opposed conservative values on most issues of importance.\"\nHeck\u2019s campaign spokesman, Brian Baluta, didn\u2019t comment on Conservative Review\u2019s rating but called the ad \"absurd on its face.\"\nSo under that narrow set of criteria, Heck and Pelosi (with an 11 percent Liberty Score) appear to have relatively similar positions.\nHowever, Heck\u2019s overall voting record is nowhere close to being as aligned to Pelosi as the ad suggests.\nA CQ Roll Call query shows Heck and Pelosi voting together roughly 31 percent of the time since the Republican entered Congress in 2011.\nThe percentage is even worse for the most recent congressional session \u2014 the two only matched up on 25 percent of roll call votes.\nOther conservative-leaning groups tend to rank Heck somewhere in the middle of Republican House members, with ranking Pelosi much lower.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatherine Cortez Masto\n\n\nstated on October 14, 2016 in a Nevada U.S. Senate debate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Heck \"voted to shut down the government.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Riley Snyder \u2022 October 20, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeritage Action Fund, which grades congressional members on conservative votes, bill co-sponsorships and other legislative activity, gives Heck a 53 percent rating and Pelosi a 16 percent rating.\nIt\u2019s a similar tale with Club for Growth\u2019s legislative scorecard, which gives Heck a 58 percent lifetime score and Pelosi a measly 6 percent score.\nThe American Conservative Union gives Heck a lifetime 64 percent ranking on their scorecard, while Pelosi has a lifetime 2.7 percent lifetime ranking over her congressional career.\nThe ad also shows several rabbits with Heck\u2019s face imposed, seeming to imply that Heck agrees with Pelosi on issues like gun control, Obamacare and amnesty for people not legally in the country.\nThat\u2019s also not the case, as a quick overview of Heck\u2019s record plants him squarely in the Republican orthodoxy on many of the issues that Angle\u2019s ad references.\n\n\nGun control: Heck has a strong pro-gun record \u2014 he\u2019s been endorsed by the National Rifle Association every time he\u2019s run for office, and he voted in favor of the only gun-related legislation considered by the Conservative Review.\n\n\nAmnesty: Though it\u2019s somewhat of a loaded term, Heck has publicly stated support for a pathway to citizenship for people not legally in the country. The Republican congressman has said he doesn\u2019t agree with presidential candidate Donald Trump\u2019s plan to deport the roughly 11 million people not legally in the country.\n\n\nObamacare: Heck \u2014 a licensed physician \u2014 is generally opposed to the Affordable Care Act and has joined House Republicans in dozens of unsuccessful attempts to repeal all or part of the law. Conservative Review only considers four votes related to health care, including bipartisan legislation increasing Veteran\u2019s Administration spending and an expansion of a grant program for veterinarians.\n\n\nDraft women: This claim is a bit more recent. Heck joined several Democrats in supporting a provision that would require women to begin registering with the Selective Service System for possible involuntary military service. The amendment was killed in a procedural maneuver in May, replaced with a requirement to study future potential needs for a broader military draft system.\n\n\nOur ruling\nAn Angle ad claims Heck has voted 62 percent of the time with Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats on a variety of important issues.\"\nUnder the narrow parameters of the Conservative Review\u2019s \"Liberty Score,\" Heck and Pelosi do appear to share similar policy priorities. But that only takes into account 50 votes over a six-year period. Other conservative groups with legislative scorecards show a much wider gap between the two, and a review of their cumulative voting records shows a much larger gap in votes.\nThis claim is inaccurate. We rate it Mostly False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/cce12a3d-22d7-4490-a2a0-cd0b6bff89a4", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04876"}
