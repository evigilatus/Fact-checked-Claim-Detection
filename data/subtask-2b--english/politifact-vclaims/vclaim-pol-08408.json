The page\u2019s creator didn\u2019t respond to our request for comment.\nThe Facebook post referenced a case in the Eastern District of New York, Abidor vs. Napolitano. U.S.-French dual citizen Pascal Abidor had his laptop searched and confiscated crossing into the United States from Canada. His laptop was returned 11 days later, when he found evidence that his personal files were searched. On Dec. 31, a federal judge dismissed the case, which followed a trend of previous cases regarding electronic privacy at U.S. borders.\nWe learned that the loose rules for border searchers the post mentioned didn\u2019t start here, or in the digital age at all.\nThe history of border searches\nLoose search regulations at the border are old news. Really old news. In 1789, the First Congress passed an exception for border searches that authorized federal officials to search people crossing the border without a warrant issued after proof of probable cause.\nA couple of years later, the Fourth Amendment became law. That protects citizens from most searches except when a warrant is obtained by proving probable cause. Today, the exception for searches near borders is a part of the Immigration and Nationality Act. It\u2019s not considered an exception to the Fourth Amendment as a whole, just to the warrant requirement.\nAt an international border or the functional equivalent of one (for example, an inland international airport), officials can search a person and his or her possessions without reasonable suspicion of criminal activity.\nThere\u2019s a similar procedure called an extended border search, where almost all the same rules apply. Within 100 miles of an international border, officials can search a person and his or her possessions, but here they have to prove reasonable suspicion, a lower threshold than probable cause.\nNow, there\u2019s a reason border officials have historically had more wiggle room to enforce their authority than other federal officials. The government wants to ensure that contraband, like illicit drugs, don\u2019t enter the country.\nThere are consequences for officers who abuse these privileges.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHogan Gidley\n\n\nstated on January 17, 2021 in a Fox News interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump \u201ccan\u2019t say anything (about the U.S. Capitol riot) because the platforms have removed him.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 18, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There\u2019s some pretty stiff administration that is taken against the officer and the agency,\" said Victor Manjarrez, a border security and immigration professor at University of Texas at El Paso. \"That\u2019s a potential civil rights violation. It\u2019s not taken lightly at all.\"\nConstitution-exempt?\nThe American Civil Liberties Union first coined the term \"Constitution-free zones.\"\nHistorically, the ACLU created the term Constitution-free zones in reference to stops near the border for reasons other than criminal activity, like random inquiries on highways about immigration status. They don\u2019t use that term in relation to inland electronics searches.\nACLU staff attorney Catherine Crump said the Facebook post on electronic privacy takes their argument (now many years old) out of context. They\u2019ve filed two lawsuits regarding electronic searches at borders, including Abidor vs. Napolitano.\n\"We don\u2019t know of any instances in which the government has taken advantage of this suspicionless electronic device search policy to search people who aren\u2019t at the functional equivalent of the border,\" Crump said.\nHow technology fits in\nWhile the border search exception isn\u2019t new, it\u2019s safe to say technology has evolved over the last few centuries, and that\u2019s what makes the more recent cases distinctive.\nBefore travelers carried phones and laptops, a search of someone\u2019s belongings could only go so far. But technology gives border officials information that reaches far beyond what a person has physical access to.\n\"The notion of these electronic searches is, in and of itself, quite dramatic,\" said Fred Cate, an Indiana University cybersecurity professor. \"Now, if you can search the laptop or the cell phone, you\u2019re probably getting access to all of their emails, all of their business records.\"\nOfficials can seize electronics and hold them for several days under the law. Of course, individuals and businesses can take precautions to limit or entirely prevent border officials from accessing private data.\nManjarrez predicted that the issue would eventually end up in the Supreme Court, but for now electronic searches are here to stay.\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post said a judge's order means there's a \"Constitution exemption zone\" if you live \"within 100 miles of the United States border.\" There is a border search exception, which long predates the district court ruling, that allows officials at or near borders to search people and their possessions without obtaining warrants. Experts say that\u2019s not an exception to the whole Fourth Amendment. It's certainly not an exemption to the entire Constitution, which covers a wide range of rights, like freedom of the press and freedom of religion.\nThe post has an element of truth but takes information out of context and requires a good deal of clarification. We rate this claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08408"}
