Yup thats (sic) the Democratic party.\"\nThe black and white photo beneath the words shows Biden holding hands with then-Democratic U.S. Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia, who the post identifies as a \"KKK leader.\"\nThe post, which had been shared more than 1,400 times by Aug. 15, was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

It was shot by Associated Press photographer Bob Bird in October 2008 as Biden, then a Democratic senator from Delaware and Barack Obama\u2019s Democratic vice presidential candidate, attended a campaign rally in downtown Charleston, W. Va. Also in the photo are the state\u2019s then-Gov. Joe Manchin and then-U.S. Sen. Jay Rockefeller, also a West Virginia Democrat.\nWhen Byrd died in 2010, he had served in the Senate longer than anyone else; the New York Times described him as \"a pillar of Capitol Hill.\" In a statement, then-President Barack Obama called him \"a voice of principle and reason.\" Biden said Byrd was \"a dear friend.\"\nHe was also once a member of the Ku Klux Klan.\u00a0\n\"It has emerged throughout my life to haunt and embarrass me and has taught me in a very graphic way what one major mistake can do to one\u2019s life, career, and reputation,\" Byrd wrote in a 2005 memoir.\u00a0\nIn West Virginia in the 1940s \u2014 late 1941 or early 1942, according to Byrd\u2019s memoir \u2014 he organized and led a 150-member chapter, or \"Klavern,\" of the Klan as the \"Exalted Cyclops.\" In Klan hierarchy, according to Slate, each Klavern is led by an Exalted Cyclops typically elected by his fellow Klansmen. The Exalted Cyclops reports to a \"Grand Giant\" (provincial leader), \"Grand Dragon\" (state director) and \"Grand Wizard\" (national chair).\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn his book, Byrd says he worked as a recruiter, or \"Kleagle,\" for the Klan until early 1943 and then left the state for a welding job in Baltimore. He returned to West Virginia after World War II ended and sent a letter in 1945 to Theodore Bilbo, a Democratic senator and segregationist from Mississippi, complaining about efforts to integrate the military.\u00a0\n\"Rather I should die a thousand times, and see Old Glory trampled in the dirt never to rise again, than to see this beloved land of ours become degraded by race mongrels,\" he wrote.\u00a0\u00a0\nHe was elected to the West Virginia House of Delegates the following year and again in 1948. In 1950, he was elected to the state Senate and in 1952, he ran for the U.S. House of Representatives. It was then that political opponents revealed his former ties to the KKK, according to a 2005 article in the Washington Post titled \"A Senator\u2019s Shame.\" Byrd acknowledged he belonged to the Klan from \"mid-1942 to early 1943\" and said he joined \"because it offered excitement and because it was strongly opposed to communism.\"\u00a0\nHe said he quit after a year but contemporaneous newspaper accounts and letters show that Byrd was involved with the Klan throughout much of the 1940s, according to the Washington Post. In 1946, for example, he said in a letter to the Grand Wizard that \"the Klan is needed today as never before, and I am anxious to see its rebirth here in West Virginia.\"\nStill, Byrd won his election and \"then spent decades apologizing for what he called a \u2018sad mistake,\u2019\" according to the Times. His civil rights record is mixed. He voted for civil rights legislation in 1957 and 1960 but he filibustered against the 1964 Civil Rights Act because he said the measure infringed on states\u2019 rights. He said he voted against the 1965 Voting Rights Acts and its renewal in 1970 for the same reason. After becoming a party leader, he consistently supported civil rights legislation and he backed Obama\u2019s presidential bid, as seen in the photo used in the Facebook post.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nThe Facebook post claims that Joe Biden was photographed with Robert Byrd, Grand Wizard of the KKK. That exaggerates Byrd\u2019s role in the KKK.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn the 1940s, Byrd organized and led a local Klan chapter as its Exalted Cyclops, but he wasn\u2019t a Grand Wizard. And he ultimately renounced his views from that period of his life though his past and former ties to the KKK were raised throughout the rest of his life.\nBy the time this photo of Byrd and Biden was taken, Byrd\u2019s public expressions of regret and shame over his earlier involvement in the KKK was well-documented and often-repeated.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWe rate this Facebook post Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00267"}
