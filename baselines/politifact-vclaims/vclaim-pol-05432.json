Marco Rubio of Florida, who\u2019s known for his strong anti-abortion views, said Hillary Clinton is the extremist when it comes abortion, not him.\n\"Why doesn\u2019t the media ask Hillary Clinton why she believes that all abortions should be legal, even on the due date of that unborn child,\" he said during the Feb. 6 Republican debate in New Hampshire.\nIs it true that Clinton \"believes all abortions should be legal even on the due date\"? \u00a0\nThe Rubio campaign didn\u2019t get back to us. So we looked at comments Clinton made on the issue over the past 15 years.\nClinton has said she could support restrictions on abortions in the third trimester (about week 28 of a pregnancy) if the mother\u2019s life and health are taken into account. Rubio casts this position as the equivalent of supporting abortions on the due date, but that exaggerates Clinton\u2019s position.\nRestricting late-term abortions\nClinton responded to Rubio\u2019s attack the morning after the debate, calling it \"pretty pathetic.\"\n\"I think that the life and health of the mother, obviously, rape and incest, have to be always taken into account,\" she said on ABC\u2019s This Week. \"And, you know, when he raises the very, very difficult issue of late-term abortion, he conveniently overlooks the fact that there are medical reasons, there are health-related reasons.\"\nWe found many instances of Clinton saying abortion should be \"safe, legal and rare.\" In short, Clinton is open to restrictions on late-term abortions provided there are exceptions for the life and health of the mother. This includes both mental health\u00a0and medical complications like preeclampsia, a pregnancy complication of high blood pressure that could lead to death.\nWe should note that those who want a total abortion ban \u2014 a position that Rubio has expressed \u2014 see exceptions made for rape, incest and health as loopholes that undermine late-term restrictions.\nAdvocating for exceptions could theoretically encompass a due-date abortion, but Rubio\u2019s conclusion that Clinton supports due-date abortions is not backed by evidence and logically unsound.\nHere\u2019s a sampling of comments Clinton's made in the past:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSept. 28, 2015,\u00a0Meet the Press Daily: \"There can be restrictions in the very end of the third trimester, but they have to take into account the life and health of the mother.\"\nJune 4, 2007,\u00a0Democratic presidential forum: \"What I have tried to both talk about and reach out about over the last many years, going back, really, at least 15 years, in talking about abortion being safe, legal, and rare. And, by rare, I mean rare.\"\nOct. 8, 2000,\u00a0New York Senate debate: \"I have said many times that I can support a ban on late-term abortions, including partial-birth abortions, so long as the health and life of the mother is protected. I\u2019ve met women who faced this heart-wrenching decision toward the end of a pregnancy. Of course it\u2019s a horrible procedure. No one would argue with that. But if your life is at stake, if your health is at stake, if the potential for having any more children is at stake, this must be a woman\u2019s choice.\"\nWhen abortions can be performed\nAccording to the reproductive health nonprofit, the Guttmacher Institute, 20 states limit abortions after \"viability\" (which refers to the point when a fetus can survive out of the womb) and 23 states prohibit abortions between 20 and 28 weeks.\nSeven states and Washington D.C., have no time restrictions, but this doesn\u2019t mean late-term abortions are common. In fact, only 1.2 percent of abortions occur after 21 weeks, according to the Guttmacher Institute.\n\n\"People say we should place legal restrictions on abortion in the third trimester. The reality is the medical community is doing that in practice,\" said Daniel Grossman, a professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at the University of California, San Francisco and an advisor at Ibis Reproductive Health. \"Third-trimester abortion is very uncommon.\"\nAs for the scenario Rubio is suggesting \u2014 an abortion performed on the due date to save the life of the mother? It doesn\u2019t exist.\n\"Nobody would talk about abortion on the woman\u2019s due date. If the mother\u2019s life was at risk, the treatment for that is delivery, and the baby survives,\" Grossman said. \"Medically, it does not compute.\"\nOur ruling\nRubio said Clinton \"believes that all abortion should be legal, even on the due date of that unborn child.\"\nClinton does not believe that all abortion should be legal. Instead, she\u2019s said she supports restrictions on late-term abortions except in cases of rape, incest and when the mother\u2019s life and health are in danger. That\u2019s not the same thing as unequivocally supporting abortions \"even on the due date\" of the child. Such an abortion would be\u00a0a purely hypothetical scenario; doctors said such a procedure doesn't make sense medically.\nWe rate Rubio\u2019s claim False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/d417a3d8-d9ec-4134-bbee-a3ceca2edde1", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05432"}
