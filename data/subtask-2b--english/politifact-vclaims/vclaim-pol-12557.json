Rob Portman says U.S. debt now matches size of gross domestic product", "text": "Rob Portman knows his budget facts. That\u2019s one reason the Ohio freshman U.S. senator, a former White House budget director, was appointed on Aug. 10, 2011, to the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, the 12-member congressional panel charged with trimming future budgets by up to $1.5 trillion.\n\nIn commenting on his appointment that day, Portman issued a statement with a budget fact that struck us as curious. He said, \"I am honored to answer the call to serve on the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction and will work hard to ensure that meaningful spending cuts are made to reduce our deficits, change the trajectory of Washington's record high debt, and to encourage economic growth and job creation. With the U.S. debt now equal to 100 percent of the GDP, Washington cannot continue to kick the can down the road again.\"\n\nHad the federal debt really matched the gross domestic product?\n\nThe GDP measures all the goods and services produced here. Add it all up and you know the size of the nation\u2019s economy. News stories have reported over the last year that if the government didn\u2019t make spending cuts or come up with more tax revenue, if not both, the debt load would match and exceed GDP eventually.\n\nHave we already reached that debt-GDP match point? No.\n\nPortman press secretary Christine Mangi said the source of the senator\u2019s claim was a wire service report by Agence France-Presse, or AFP, whose stories are published in newspapers and on the Web. On Aug. 3, using figures for new borrowing as soon as Congress and President Barack Obama lifted the nation\u2019s debt ceiling, AFP reported: \"U.S. gross debt shot up $238 billion to reach 100 percent of gross domestic product after the government's debt ceiling was lifted, Treasury figures showed.\" This new borrowing, the wire report said, \"took total public debt to $14.58 trillion, over end-2010 GDP of $14.53 trillion, putting the United States in a league with highly indebted countries like Italy and Belgium.\"\n\nWe checked those figures. The GDP number used by the wire service was solid -- but out of date. The figure came from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, or BEA, whose estimates put the economy\u2019s size last year at $14.5265 trillion.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem: That was GDP for 2010. It has grown since then. GDP was $15.0038 trillion in the second quarter of this year, the most recent measurement available, according to the BEA.\n\nComparing GDP with debt, we ran the numbers a couple of other ways, using both old and newer BEA figures for GDP and the Treasury Department\u2019s \"Debt to the Penny\" website for specific debt figures. If you wanted to use 2010 GDP, a fairer comparison would be to measure gross debt on Dec. 31, 2010, which was equal to 96.5 percent of the GDP. That\u2019s high, of course, and it prompted concerns about spending and revenues. But it \u00a0was not seen as a \u00a0doomsday trigger.\n\nSo what was the ratio of debt to GDP when Portman made his comment?\n\nThe closest calculation possible, using confirmed government figures, is made by comparing GDP for the second quarter of 2011 ($15.0038 trillion) with gross debt ( $14.5819 trillion) on Aug. 10, the day of Portman\u2019s statement. That puts the gross debt at 97.2 percent of GDP. Since Portman relied on the AFP story of a week earlier, we compared the debt on that day, too, and got the same result: Gross debt was 97.2 percent of GDP.\n\nIs this too much quibbling over less than 3 percentage points?\n\nIf this were baseball, the statistical equivalent would be to celebrate Barry Bonds making the 3,000-hit club when he hit still had 85 hits to go; in the end, he never made the record. (All other parallels between big numbers and disgrace are strictly incidental.) But in finance, the distance is not as great.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund said last year that total debt could match the size of the GDP by 2012, according to Bloomberg, the financial wire service. House Speaker John Boehner made the same prediction, and PolitiFact called it accurate. If anything, the likelihood of the gross debt hitting 100 percent of GDP this calendar year (but in the 2012 fiscal year, which starts in October) has since grown. That\u2019s because the debt is still rising at what is likely to be a faster pace than economic growth, which is torpid. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\"I imagine it will happen sometime in early FY2012,\" Jason Peuquet, a policy analyst at the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, told us.\n\nSo Portman was off but \"pretty darn close, given the information we have,\" Peuquet said.\n\nStill, there\u2019s a caveat: This gross debt that he spoke about is not the scary part to many economists. More important, they say, is the portion of debt that\u2019s owed to the public. This is the pool of Treasury securities that the government sells to investors, and it was $9.916 trillion the day Portman made his statement.\n\nMeasured against the size of the economy, that comes to 66 percent of GDP. It\u2019s the highest level since shortly after World War II, when the nation was paying off war debts. In a worst-case scenario, with continuation of current tax rates and no change in spending policies, the public debt could exceed GDP by 2021, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said in June.\n\nThat\u2019s the doomsday scenario. But the CBO\u2019s more likely scenario would put the public debt at 70 percent in 2020.\n\nThe rest of the debt -- $4.67 trillion -- is intra-governmental lending, including Social Security surpluses that the government uses for other federal operations. The money will have to be paid back, but the demand is less pressing right now and it doesn\u2019t affect credit markets. That\u2019s why the public debt, not the gross debt, is what\u2019s most important for understanding the government\u2019s fiscal health, says Gary Therkildsen, a fiscal policy analyst at OMB Watch, a nonprofit government-accountability group.\n\nThe CBO was matter-of-fact about it in a report last December: \"Gross debt is not a good indicator of the government\u2019s fiscal condition.\"\n\nWith that bit of background, we return to Portman.\n\nPolitiFact has discussed the debt\u2019s components before, and economists have said that it\u2019s important to distinguish between the two kinds of debt. But they also say it is not inaccurate -- depending on the context -- to put the two together in order to discuss the gross debt, and that\u2019s what Portman did. Given his stated interest in dealing with long-term budget matters including entitlements, it\u2019s not unreasonable for him to talk about the gross debt.\n\nWhere does that leave us?\n\nPortman said the \"U.S. debt is now equal to 100 percent of the GDP.\" \u00a0It is not, but \"he\u2019s pretty darn close, given the information we have,\" says Peuquet.\n\nBefore we rate Portman\u2019s claim, we\u2019ll note that Mangi, Portman\u2019s press secretary, offered still another way of calculating the debt-to-GDP ratio. Although we quibble with this methodology because it still uses outdated numbers, this took the percentage to 98.5 percent, very close to the 97.2 percent figure we got. \u00a0Mangi then offered an additional argument to push the percentage past 100: Add in all the debt held by state and local governments, too, \"because the United States government includes federal, state and local governments,\" she said. Put all that debt together and it already exceeds 100 percent of GDP.\n\nProblem is, local and state debt are not part of the broad, divisive debate that led to creation of the new super committee. Portman\u2019s committee is dealing with federal deficits and debt, not the debt of Parma.\n\nAnd when Portman said \"the U.S. debt now equals 100 percent of the GDP,\" it was clear -- as it has been from weeks of debate in Washington -- which debt he meant.\n\nThe gross debt hasn\u2019t reached 100 percent, but it will.\n \nPortman\u2019s statement is not 100 percent accurate, but at 97 percent-plus, it\u2019s close enough to merit a rating of Mostly True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSherrod Brown\n\n\nstated on November 30, 2010 in an MSNBC interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Understand, this is unemployment insurance.
