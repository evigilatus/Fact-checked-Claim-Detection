The article noted the timing of the trip was also due to the firing of former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe.\nBut Obama\u2019s trip to New Zealand was already confirmed in late February, long before McCabe\u2019s firing. Obama visited the country to meet with Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and discuss topics such as climate change and social media\u2019s impact on politics.\nThe article also claimed that Obama left a \"trail of proof\" through the presidential daily briefings inside the White House proving that he plotted with Russia to obstruct Trump amid the presidential decision.\nThe hero of the article is depicted as U.S. Rep. Devin Nunes, who compiled a memo that accused top FBI officials of alleged wrongdoing. It\u00a0concluded that Nunes was the one who found that Obama\u2019s presidential daily briefings included illegal Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA)\u00a0activity and \"spy games\" targeting Trump. We found no evidence that Nunes has ever made such allegations against Obama.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn March 2017, Trump tweeted that Obama had wiretapped Trump Tower during the 2016 presidential campaign, an accusation that the heads of both the NSA and the FBI denied.\nWhat actually happened is that the FBI and the Department of Justice put together an application to the FISA court that approves surveillance warrants pertaining to national security and foreign intelligence.\nObama himself, however, would have no role in authorizing or requesting wiretaps.\nOur ruling\nA hoax website claimed that Obama fled the country due to new evidence that he was involved with spying on Trump and responsible for colluding with Russia.\nWe found that Obama\u2019s trip abroad to New Zealand was to speak about issues with the prime minister, and he was not involved with ordering any wiretaps to spy on Trump during the election.\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02228"}
