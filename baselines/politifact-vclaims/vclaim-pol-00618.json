Messam, a city mayor in the same county where the 2018 Parkland school shooting happened, claimed that his abilities are restrained now, because a Florida law prohibits him from even talking about changing gun laws.\n\"Last year, I sued the state to allow local leaders to protect our residents from gun violence because in Florida, it\u2019s illegal for mayors to even bring up gun reform for discussion,\" Messam, the mayor of Miramar, Fla., said on his campaign website.\nIs it true that Florida mayors are legally barred from discussing gun laws? Messam\u2019s claim needs context.\nFlorida law says cities can\u2019t regulate firearms, ammunition\nThe state Legislature in 1987 passed a law to give the state the exclusive right to regulate firearms and ammunition. And in 2011 the state added penalties that can be imposed on municipalities and local officials who violate the law by \"enacting or causing to be enforced any local ordinance or administrative rule or regulation\" on firearms and ammunition. The law doesn\u2019t explicitly say they can\u2019t talk about it.\nThe penalties were added to prevent local officials from making and enforcing their own rules.\nMiramar and several other Florida cities have filed a lawsuit against the state. That lawsuit isn\u2019t seeking to nullify the 1987 law that originally banned local officials from enacting gun laws, rather to get rid of the penalties added in 2011.\nWhat are the penalties? If a court finds the violation \"knowing and willful,\" the local official gets a civil fine of up to $5,000. The governor can also remove the person from office.\nDoes that mean that local officials, including mayors, can\u2019t discuss reforms to gun laws?\n\"The law appears to aim at stopping mayors from regulating via executive order,\" said James B. Jacobs, a law professor and director of the Center for Research in Crime and Justice at NYU School of Law. \"But it surely doesn\u2019t prohibit advocacy or discussion.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Says Gen.

But the penalties violate the right to free speech and have the effect of silencing officials, the lawsuit argues.\nElected officials don\u2019t even debate ordinances out of fear of being penalized, the lawsuit said, adding that the penalties \"impose substantial burdens\" on constituents and elected officials\u2019 ability to \"engage in core political speech leading up to a vote.\"\nMessam\u2019s spokeswoman, Cassandra Fenelon, said the law opens \"many questions as it pertains to municipal authorities and exceptions.\" As a result of ambiguities in the law and the accompanying penalties, Fenelon said, local municipal attorneys advise officials not to discuss or enact policies on firearms and ammunition.\nThe Legislature intends \"to chill and deter local governments from taking any action at all that might affect firearms, even when such action might not be preempted,\" Fenelon said.\nOur ruling\nMessam said that in Florida, \"it\u2019s illegal for mayors to even bring up gun reform for discussion.\"\nFlorida law prohibits local officials from enacting rules on firearms and ammunition. There are penalties for officials who enact or cause the enforcement of such regulations. Officials may choose not to discuss changes to gun laws, since they can\u2019t legally enact them. But that law doesn\u2019t directly prohibit the discussion of gun laws.\nMessam\u2019s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.
