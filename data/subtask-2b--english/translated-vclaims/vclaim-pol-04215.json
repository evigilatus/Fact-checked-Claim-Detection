Our taxes are very high, our wages are very high, everything is very high. What's going to happen now is that people are going to start firing people.\" This was echoed by similar comments made during the presidential presidential debate in November that wages were \"very high.\" When asked whether the minimum wage would be raised, he said, \"I will not do so.\" But later in the campaign, Trump showed more interest in raising the minimum wage, although he often said that he would leave it to the United States. On ABC Day this week on May 8, 2016, the host George Stefanopoulos Trump asked, \"The minimum wage -- all of it through the preparatory elections, you're against an increase. Now you're saying you're looking at him. So what's the bottom line on this?\" Trump answered, \"Well, I'm looking at it and I haven't decided in terms of numbers. But I think people should get more.\" When Stefanopoulos asked if this change, Trump answered, \"Well, it's definitely a change. I'm allowed to change. You need flexibility.\" Also on May 8, in the NTBC me the Press, he did not understand how people lived at the minimum wage of $7.25 an hour.

Because don't forget, the states must compete with each other.\" She went on to ask whether Trump believed that states should be able only to determine whether they would raise the minimum wage from the Union &apos; s $7.25 minimum wage, or whether there should be no minimum wage at all - giving the states the option of reducing the minimum wage to less than $7.25 or not. But do the federal government have to lay down the floor? Todd asked. \"No,\" Trump answered. \"I'd rather the states go out and do what they have to do.\" The spokesman for the Trump Stephen Cheung campaign referred us to the Trump Statement on allowing states to set minimum wages from his press conference on 27 July in South Florida.

By Bill McCarthy \u2022 20 January 2021 \"The minimum wage must be raised. People... at least $10, but they have to go up. But I think states -- federal -- I think states should really shoot. For example, I live in New York. It's very expensive in New York. You can't buy a hot dog for the money you're talking about. You go to other states and it's not expensive at all. Now what he's doing is putting New York at a disadvantage if the minimum wage rises, companies move and things, bad things happen. At the same time, people must be taken care of. But what I'm really gonna do on the minimum wage... but it has to go up... So I'd like to raise it to at least $10.\" We gave him a full boost to his position on whether the federal government should set the minimum wage. Penny &apos; s minimum wage data record opposition to the increases in the minimum wage and the generally crushing of the minimum wage during Congress.

Trump was throughout the map of wages and the federal minimum wage. He would not raise the minimum wage. Subsequently, he seemed willing to raise the minimum wage but said that the decision should be made by the states. Pines' record in Congress showed that he was opposed to raising the minimum wage and made some critical comments about the idea of a minimum wage, but we did not find it to be abolished.
