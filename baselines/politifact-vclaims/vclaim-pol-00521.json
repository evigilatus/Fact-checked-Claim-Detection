(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) And we couldn\u2019t find any evidence that the post includes accurate information.\nThe Democratic National Committee did not immediately respond to an email asking about the post. But the claim is an old one, dating back to June 2018, after Obama spoke at a DNC fundraiser in Beverly Hills, Calif., delivering what Politico then reported were his first public comments in months.\n\"Obama stuck to his routine of never saying President Donald Trump\u2019s name in public, but he spoke at length about what his problems are with the Trump presidency \u2014 and why he thinks Democrats would be foolish to believe that they\u2019re in good shape to beat him (in 2020) just because they\u2019ve been doing well in winning recent elections,\" the June 29 article says.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.

Rather, he encouraged them to vote.\n\"Former President Barack Obama tries to mobilize Democrats at fundraiser event,\" reads the headline of a Time article after the speech.\nSearching the Nexis news database for the statement in the Facebook post and Obama\u2019s name, we found no results. We also didn\u2019t find the statement attributed to someone else in news articles.\nA more recent DNC fundraiser in Atlanta on June 6 featured presidential candidates Joe Biden and Beto O\u2019Rourke, but news stories didn\u2019t mention Obama. Because, it seems, he wasn\u2019t there.\nWe rate this statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00521"}
