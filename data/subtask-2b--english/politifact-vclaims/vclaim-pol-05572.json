She said Obama and Clinton have left the United States \"woefully uprepared for cyberterrorism.\"\nFiorina said cybersecurity is \"a critical piece of our strategy to defeat ISIS and restore American leadership in the world.\" She made a number of assertions in that column; here we\u2019ll look at one she made about the United States\u2019 efforts to prevent cyber attacks from China.\n\"When we held recent economic dialogues with China,\" Fiorina wrote, \"we agreed on over 100 different things\u200a\u2014 \u200aincluding wildlife trafficking and volcano research. None of these 100-plus points of agreement addressed cybersecurity.\"\nChina has been implicated in past data breaches, including perhaps the most far-reaching hacking incident so far, which accessed a large cache of sensitive personal data held by the federal Office of Personnel Management.\nCampaign spokeswoman Anna Epstein told us that Fiorina was referring to a news release in which the White House summarized 127 areas of agreement reached in June 2015 at the Strategic & Economic Dialogue, a periodic summit between high-level representatives of the United States and China.\nFiorina has a point that none of the 127 items on that list explicitly addressed cybersecurity. However, her argument is weaker if one looks beyond that list of 127 items: Fiorina ignored a subsequent agreement between the United States and China that dealt directly with cybersecurity.\nBut let\u2019s start with the summit. In their public addresses at the summit\u2019s opening, Vice President Joe Biden, Secretary of State John Kerry and Treasury Secretary Jack Lew each said that cybersecurity was an important issue for U.S.-China relations, and Chinese Vice Premier Wang Yang agreed in his speech.\nThe cybersecurity discussion -- a thorny one -- apparently did not lead to an agreement by the end of the summit, though experts told PolitiFact it may have been covered within the 127-point list by point 4, which confirmed the existence of \"candid, constructive discussions between the two sides on strategic security issues.\"\nThe biggest problem with Fiorina\u2019s claim, though, is that it fails to account for significant developments later in 2015.\nThe most important of these is an agreement on cybersecurity between the United States and China announced in September. That came almost three months before Fiorina posted her column.\nOn Sept. 24 and 25, Obama hosted President Xi Jinping of China for a state visit. During that visit, the two leaders announced an agreement on cybersecurity. Here are some of the key elements the two countries agreed on:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in remarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 Cooperation on investigating malicious cyber-activities coming from their territory;\n\u2022 A pledge not to conduct or knowingly support cyber-theft of confidential business information to aid companies or industries;\n\u2022 Efforts to promote international consensus on norms for state behavior in cyberspace;\n\u2022 Creation of a \"high-level joint dialogue\" on cybercrime with regular meetings, as well as a \"hotline\" to prevent the escalation of issues.\n\"This was important, because China accepted that states should not conduct cyber espionage against commercial entities to create competitive advantage,\" said Adam Segal, senior fellow for China studies and director of the Digital and Cyberspace Policy Program at the Council on Foreign Relations.\nAnd there have been notable developments since then, Segal has written: \"There was positive follow up in the first round of cyber talks between the Department of Homeland Security and Chinese Ministry of Public Security in December 2015\" when the two sides \"agreed on guidelines for requesting assistance on cybercrime or other malicious cyber activities, as well as to conduct \u2018tabletop exercises\u2019 in spring 2016 and to define procedures for use of the hotline.\"\nIn addition, since Xi\u2019s visit, the White House has worked to advance cybersecurity policies with other countries. A similar agreement between the United Kingdom and China has been struck, and there are indications that Germany would sign a \"no cyber theft\" deal with Beijing in 2016, Segal wrote.\nMeanwhile, during the G-20 summit in November 2015, the White House announced that the leaders in attendance reached a notable consensus that international law applies to state conduct in cyberspace, including pledges not to \"conduct or support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property.\"\nIt\u2019s worth noting that experts acknowledge significant difficulties in enforcing cybersecurity agreements. \"Just three weeks after the agreement, cybersecurity companies reported new attacks on pharmaceutical companies,\" Segal wrote.\nOur ruling\nFiorina said, \"When we held recent economic dialogues with China, we agreed on over 100 different things\u200a\u2014\u200aincluding wildlife trafficking and volcano research. None of these 100-plus points of agreement addressed cybersecurity.\"\nOne document listing agreements struck during a June 2015 U.S.-China summit supports Fiorina\u2019s point, but citing that one document is a case of extreme cherry-picking. Three months later -- and three months before Fiorina published her article -- the United States and China struck a significant cybersecurity agreement, and since then, the countries have taken steps to implement the agreement and forge cybersecurity agreements with other nations.\nThe statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate the claim Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05572"}
