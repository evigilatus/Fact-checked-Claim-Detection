Furthermore, Bill No. 3145 calls for an increase in nickel to 10 cents if the rate of recovery is reduced to less than 80 per cent for two years, respectively. (Matt Wengard, R-Wilsonville) was among the 12 legislators in the House of Representatives to vote against the bill. He thinks it's a really great idea, but he doesn't like the possibility of getting a cent for every drink. \"I'm hanging on an increase in fees,\" said in his floor speech, later, he added, \"deposit deposits of 5 to 10 cents, for example in case of bottles of water, can literally double the price of that product in the store.\" Now, bottled water in cheap bottles. The deposit of the bottle bill is for each container, not the size of the container mentioned -- so, the higher the containers, the higher the deposits (recoverable, of course). But can nickel really double the price of a bunch of water bottles? A quick check in the centre of Portland Safway showed these prices for 24 bottles of water: our caffeine, $4.99 each, or $3.99 each, if you buy two boxes. - Arrowhead Springwater, $3.79 each for the Sefway Club. In an interview on January 31, 2021, John Kerry said that Hurricane Harvey \"dropped water in Houston in five days more than Niagara Falls in one year.\" Wingard had similar examples, as well as a bargaining price of $2.99 for the Crystal Geiser case in Albertsons. Tuck's on $2.40 and that's actually almost twice the original price of $2.99. But the context is crucial and we want to offer some of that. First, Wingard highlighted the worst-case scenario when it came to depositing the bottle bill. The small bottles of regular water - added under the bottle bill in 2007 - are cheap. Most depositable drinks cost only pennies, but they are more than 89 cents per piece, or $1.59 per piece, or $6.99 for the six package. Secondly, we know Wingard and the others are convinced that the deposit of the bottle will rise to 10 cents -- but this is not a finished deal. Under the current draft law, placement remains at 5 cents unless recovery rates fall below 80 per cent for two consecutive years; the first measurable years are 2014 and 2015, with the nearest amount to be collected in January 1, 2017. New canned or bottled drinks in this legislation, such as coffee, tea, energy drinks, etc. It is not calculated as part of the recovery rates until January 2021.) The recovery rate in 2009 was 75 per cent, according to the recycling cooperative in Oregon, and is expected to be several percentage points lower in 2010. However, that does not mean that the deposit of ten cents is very close to the angle. Third, Wingard does not indicate that current sediments on a water state are already high, compared to their basic cost. For $1.20, that $2.99 of water is $4.19 under the current bottle bill. Four, water bottle lovers can get $1.20 or $2.40, only by returning containers. It's not a drawing to lose forever. If you don't get your bottles and packs back, know that beer and wine distributors will be able to keep the money. In response, Wingard said that he had focused his statement on bottled water. Yeah, it's getting tight, the cost of a state of water can almost double. But Wingard does a lot of lifting to get to his statement and ignores two particularly crucial points: the fact that there are already five cents of deposits on these items -- that is, in fact, the increase in the proportion of what buyers bombard much less than 100% -- as well as the fact that this is the money that can be repaid -- you get it once you return the bottles. So \"cost\" could be zero. Because his statement ignores critical facts that give a different impression, we hardly assess his claim.
