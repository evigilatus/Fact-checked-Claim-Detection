Couples over 55 are unlikely to produce children, she pointed out. Yet it would be unconstitutional to deny them a marriage license.\n\nSo, she asked, what\u2019s the difference between that couple and a same-sex couple that can\u2019t naturally conceive?\n\nAttorney Charles Cooper, arguing in favor of California\u2019s ban, said, \"With respect to couples over the age of 55, it is very rare that \u2026 both parties to the couple are infertile.\"\n\nA bit later, he clarified: \"Very few men outlive their own fertility.\"\n\nHe explained that the state\u2019s interest in marriage extends to older couples, because preserving the \"marital norm\" \u00a0\u2014\u00a0with its obligations of fidelity and monogamy \u2014 discourages \"irresponsible procreative conduct outside of that marriage.\" (He meant old guys having affairs with young mistresses.)\n\nIt\u2019s settled science that most women over 55 can\u2019t naturally conceive. But we wondered \u2014\u00a0apart from what it may mean for the constitutionality of same-sex marriage \u2014 what does science say about men\u2019s fertility in their declining years?\n\nDo \"very few men outlive their own fertility\"?\n\nWhat studies say \u2014 and don\u2019t say\n\nWe spoke with a range of fertility experts, combed through their research, and can tell you this: Science doesn't yet tell us how many old men can make babies.\n\nEspecially if we\u2019re talking about natural conception of the variety that might take place if a 70-year-old is seeing a 25-year-old on the side. The kind that requires, you know, sex, and enough sperm that move vigorously enough to reach and penetrate an egg.\n\n(One expert told us some couples who visit fertility clinics don\u2019t realize sex is required to make babies. We\u2019re going to assume here that you generally get how this process works.)\n\nWe do know that roughly 10 to 20 percent of couples generally are infertile, with the man\u2019s fertility a factor in about 40 percent of those cases.\n\nBut evidence is tricky when it comes to fertility as men age.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCooper\u2019s office sent us links to two studies that note men make sperm late into life. But one happens to document age-related decline in sperm quality and the other notes that studies suggest men contribute to reduced fertility beginning in their early 40s.\n\nHere\u2019s a roundup of points on both sides.\n\nSigns of late-life fertility:\n\n\u2022 There\u2019s no \"cliff\" as with menopause around age 50 in women, where fertility drops off dramatically.\n\n\u2022 Most men still make sperm into old age, studies say. (This is different from women, who are born with all the eggs they will ever have \u2014\u00a0no making fresh ones.)\n\n\u2022 Sperm count, one of the most important measures of male fertility, isn\u2019t as sensitive to age as other factors, said Andrew La Barbera, scientific director for the American Society for Reproductive Medicine.\n\n\u2022 We\u2019ve all heard of guys old enough to be great-grandfathers fathering kids. Or, as Justice Antonin Scalia joked in court, about the late Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, who fathered four children in his late 60s and early 70s.\n\nPoints that give pause:\n\n\u2022 While there\u2019s no menopause-like fertility cliff for men, sperm quality, amount of semen and fertility do appear to decline with age. Older men may be more likely to make sperm that\u2019s strangely shaped and doesn\u2019t swim well. \"These data suggest that men may become progressively less fertile as they age,\" said a 2003 study cited by Cooper\u2019s office.\n\n\u2022 The timing of fertility decline may vary dramatically from person to person \u2014 but there\u2019s a need for more research to explain the variation.\n\n\u2022 There\u2019s no clear research that shows how many older men may be capable of impregnating a woman in a year of regular sex,\u00a0the clinical definition of fertility.\n\n\"We don\u2019t have data on men as they age ... not men who are in their 60s and 70s,\" said Harry Fisch, clinical professor of urology and reproductive medicine at Weill Cornell Medical College and author of The Male Biological Clock. \"Very few men in these studies are older.\"\n\n\"If it\u2019s true, then let me ask you: Where\u2019s the data?\"\n\nThat point was echoed by researchers who explained the limits of current studies.\n\n\"It is rather difficult to give a precise estimate of (men\u2019s) fertility by age because very few are still trying to have children beyond 60 or 65 years,\" said Henri Leridon, an expert in human reproduction who headed research at France\u2019s National Institute for Demographic Studies.\n\nAn Israeli fertility researcher, Eliezer Girsh, told PolitiFact that not only does fertility decline in men after age 50, but that just 20 to 40 percent of men are \"still fertile in advanced age.\"\n\nOther experts said that, frankly, there\u2019s a need for more research.\n\nBut anecdotes sometimes overshadow the lack of data.\n\nThe oldest scientifically documented case of fatherhood: a 94-year-old.\n\nOur ruling\n\nCooper argued before the Supreme Court that \"very few men outlive their own fertility.\" Experts we consulted generally agree that men \u2014 or at least some men \u2014\u00a0may still father children well into their advanced years. But whether that\u2019s most men or a minority isn\u2019t yet supported by research. Meanwhile, emerging studies document declining fertility as individual men age, and studies don\u2019t yet confirm how many men remain fertile their entire lives.
