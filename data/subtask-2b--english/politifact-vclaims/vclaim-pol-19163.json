Trump's term ended today (at 7:39PM ET),\" reads one Facebook post. It includes a screengrab of a State Department webpage that reads \"Donald J. Trump's term ended on 2021-01-11 19:39:00.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nThe image is legitimate, but the claim in the post is misleading. It was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nHere\u2019s what happened: Nine days before President-elect Joe Biden takes office, Trump\u2019s biography page on the official State Department website was edited to read what we see in the post, that \"Donald J. Trump's term ended on 2021-01-11.\" Mike Pence\u2019s biography was also updated to say, \"Michael R. Pence's term ended on 2021-01-11.\"\nBut these changes did not amount to an official \"statement\" from the State Department, as the claim suggests.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCiting two unnamed diplomats, Buzzfeed News reported Jan. 11 that the website edits were the work of a \"disgruntled employee.\" CNN confirmed Buzzfeed\u2019s report.\u00a0\nBoth web pages were taken down around 3:50 p.m. Jan. 11 and replaced with error messages. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo ordered an internal investigation, according to Buzzfeed.\u00a0\nThe website changes appeared as Democrats were beginning the impeachment process against Trump on grounds that he incited a mob of his supporters to storm the U.S. Capitol.\u00a0\nThe State Department did not return requests for comment.\u00a0\nThe claim that the State Department released a statement that Trump\u2019s term ended Jan. 11 contains an element of truth in that\u00a0the agency\u2019s website was edited to falsely suggest it had. But the change was not an official statement by the State Department. Rather, reporting indicates this was the action of a rogue employee; Trump is still president.\u00a0\u00a0\nWe rate it Mostly False.\u00a0\u200b", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19163"}
