From the sputtering online insurance marketplaces to the millions of Americans who will lose insurance plans that don\u2019t meet the new law\u2019s standards, it has been a feeding frenzy for conservatives.\nBut speaking Nov. 3, 2013, on Fox News Sunday, senator-turned-commentator Scott Brown dredged up some old claims about the Affordable Care Act to add to the ongoing criticism. Brown was a Massachusetts state senator when then-Gov. Mitt Romney passed what would become the blueprint for Obamacare, and he compared his own state\u2019s effort to the federal law.\n\"When the president was in Boston, it made my blood boil,\" Brown said. \"I worked on the Massachusetts plan. It didn\u2019t raise taxes or cut Medicare, and this one does.\"\nWe\u2019ll put aside for now Brown\u2019s claims about what the Massachusetts law did and didn\u2019t do. (For starters, it couldn\u2019t cut Medicare because that\u2019s a federal program). Instead, we\u2019ll focus on Brown\u2019s statement that Obamacare raises taxes and cuts Medicare.\nRaising taxes?\nWe\u2019ll start with Brown\u2019s claim on taxes.\nThe health care law requires most uninsured Americans to purchase health insurance. Individuals who don\u2019t comply with the law face a tax penalty when they file their taxes next year.\nIn its decision to uphold the individual mandate, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the penalty was basically a tax that Congress was imposing on people who failed to buy insurance. The contentious decision allowed Obama\u2019s signature legislative achievement to survive a constitutional battle.\nThere\u2019s still plenty of debate on whether that penalty is a tax or just analogous to one. But there are other tax hikes in the law we\u2019ve reviewed before that give Brown clearance to make his claim.\nA good part of the law\u2019s new taxes are on the wealthy. High earners -- defined as households making make more than $250,000 or single people making more than $200,000 -- will see their Medicare payroll taxes go up by\u00a00.9 percentage points, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. Also, they will pay an additional tax on investment income of 3.8 percent.\nOther taxes in the law hit the insurance companies, the health care industry and even indoor tanning salons, including:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA 2.3 percent excise tax on manufacturers and importers of certain medical devices.\n\n\nA 40 percent excise tax on employer-provided \"Cadillac\" health insurance plans costing more than $10,200 for individuals and $27,500 for families. Takes effect Jan. 1, 2018.\n\n\nA 10 percent excise tax on indoor tanning services.\n\n\nSo regardless of whether the penalty imposed on people who don\u2019t buy insurance is a tax, there are other taxes that raise revenue to offset the costs of the new law.\nCuts Medicare?\nThis is one of the claims we\u2019ve checked the most since the start of the 2010 midterm campaigns, and we typically rate it Mostly False or Half True, depending on the specific claim. It became a big issue in the 2012 election as well, when Romney, the Republican nominee, hoped to win over support from older voters in swing states like Florida by accusing Obama of slashing the popular entitlement program for seniors.\nWritten into the health care law is a reduction in future Medicare spending. It is not a cut in current services. The reductions take place over the next decade (the last estimate pegged it at $716 billion over 10 years) and are achieved by offering incentives and penalties to health care providers to promote more efficient care.\nIn an email to PolitiFact, Brown specifically pointed to stories written about cuts to Medicare Advantage, which make up about a third of the projected savings.\nMedicare Advantage is a program started under President George W. Bush that provides some seniors with private insurance plans. In recent years it has proven to be more costly than traditional Medicare, and the Affordable Care Act seeks to rein in the program by decreasing reimbursements and pressuring the plans to be more efficient.\nThe Republican budget proposed by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., takes advantage of Medicare savings as well. Romney continued to criticize Obama and refer to them as \"cuts\" to Medicare even as he tapped Ryan to be his 2012 running mate.\nIt should be noted that while representing Massachusetts in the U.S. Senate, Brown voted against the Ryan plan. So we can\u2019t call him a hypocrite. But it\u2019s an exaggeration to say Obama is cutting Medicare.\nOur ruling\nBrown said Obamacare raises taxes and cuts Medicare,\u00a0a two-pronged attack. The law definitely raises taxes. As to whether it cuts Medicare, that's a more complicated picture.\u00a0The standard benefits for people on Medicare were largely left intact. The law does try to prod the health care industry and insurers who are part of Medicare to operate with more efficiency. Considering both points, we rate his statement Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08665"}
