Allen\u2019s six years in office, he voted for budgets adding $3.1 trillion to the national debt -- that\u2019s $16,400 for every second Sen. Allen was in office,\" Radtke said in a Jan. 17 news release.\n\nThat\u2019s the price of a brand new, four-door Chevy Cobalt for ever second Allen was in the Senate \u00a02001 and 2007, according to a Google search. We revved our engines to see if Radtke is right.\n\nChuck Hansen, a spokesman for Radtke, said they based their calculation on \u00a0the national debt growth between the last day of 2001 and the final day of 2007.\n\nThat was a mistake. \u00a0The federal fiscal year runs from Oct. 1 through Sept. 30. The first spending votes Allen cast in the Senate were for the budget that began Oct. 1, 2001 -- some three months before Radtke started counting.\n\nAnd the last spending votes Allen cast were for the budget that started Oct. 1, 2006 -- five weeks before his defeat -- and ended Sept. 30, 2007. That\u2019s some three months before Radtke stopped counting.\n\nSo our period runs from Oct. 1, 2001 to Sept. 30, 2007.\n\nNext, we visited a U.S. Department of Treasury website\u00a0to determine the national debt on each date. Rounding off, it started at $5.806 trillion and ended at $9.008 trillion.\n\nThat means federal budgets passed during Allen\u2019s term increased debt by $3.202 trillion. Did the former Senator approve all of it?\n\nCongress does not hold simple up or down votes on the federal budget. Instead, it votes on a series of appropriations for various department. We turned to THOMAS, a Library of Congress web site that records the action on Capitol Hill. We found Allen supported each of about four dozen \u00a0appropriation bills that came to Senate floor during his term.\n\nSo we made no deductions from the $3.202 trillion increase in debt.\n\nAllen served 2,193 days in the Senate -- from Jan. 3, 2001 to Jan. 4, 2007. That\u2019s 189,475,200 seconds.\n\nHe voted for budgets that increased the debt by $16,896.68 per second. That\u2019s almost $497 a second more than Radtke credited to Allen. So we\u2019ve added a kickin\u2019 stereo to the basic features of our Chevy Cobalt.\n\nBut before you get angry at Allen, consider this: The debt has risen by $54,684.24 a second since he left office. And Webb has voted \"yea\" on each 27 appropriations bills that helped get it there.\n\nIn case you\u2019re wondering, we have now upgraded to a brand new, fully-loaded Lincoln Navigator every second. We\u2019re talking about a luxury SUV with leather seats, parking sensors, GPS, rain-detecting wipers and sound that will make you think you\u2019re in Carnegie Hall.\n\nOnly problem is it gets 14 miles a gallon, so it will cost us down the road.\n\nLet\u2019s review\n\nRadtke said the Allen voted for budgets that increased the debt by $16,400 every second he was in the Senate. Her formula was a bit flawed; the actual figure is $16,896.68 a second.\n\nWe find it hard to penalize Radtke for a slight mistake she made in her opponent\u2019s favor. So we rate her statement True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13734"}
