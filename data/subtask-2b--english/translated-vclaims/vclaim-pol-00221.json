Tony Evers urged state residents to turn around, to get rid of distractions, to drive soft and to obey traffic laws. These words appeared in a chart that accompanied Evers August 20, 2019, on Twitter, saying: \"Secure leadership is everyone's job.\" The graph, developed by the Evers Office, used a series of statistics to try to steer this point home. She noted, for example, that the use of the seat belt reduced injuries and that the maximum alcohol limit in Wisconsin was 0.08. But this distraction clearly appeared: \"One in four car accidents in the United States was caused by text messages and driving.\" In the midst of all possible causes of aircraft crash - weather, weak driving, and other technology-related distractions - does text messages really make up a full 25 per cent? Let's see if Evers has taken the wrong path. According to experts, the collapse data is incomplete and the National Safety Council, a non-profit organization hired by Congress, says that the dispersed leadership of any kind is difficult to track because local authorities do not consistently record collapse data. The Board was tracking messages and driving, but stopped doing so in 2015 with the spread of vehicle technology (e.g. entertainment, navigation and telephone-related operating systems). \"The nature of the dispersed command has changed with the explosion of the internal dashboard systems,\" said Ken Kolosh, Director of Statistics at the Safety Council. The Board has long used traffic accident statistics from the National Highway Traffic Safety Department, which collects traffic accident reports from local police agencies throughout the country. However, these reports have not kept pace with changes in technology. The Safety Council report identified Wisconsin as one of a handful of states requiring the police to include detailed information in each crash report that shows how technology is involved. But this is the exception, not the rule. Even in 26 states there is no scope for reporting to identify text messages as a cause of accident. Only three states have collapse report fields that address in-house technology in vehicles. A 2013 study of fatal incident reports by the Safety Council concluded that even when drivers acknowledge the use of the telephone to the police, the listed officer only uses the cell phone half the time. On January 10, 2021, in a television interview, \"It takes a long time on election day to download those cards, which is why we have 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. to throw the ballot papers at Milwaukee.\" \"There are no reliable estimates of the number of collisions caused by dispersed drivers,\" reports of the Institute for Highway Safety Insurance on its website. \"Statistics based on crash data reported by the police will almost certainly diminish the role of fragmentation in fatal crashes.\" The statistics we have said the insurance group has a clear link between cellular phone use and collision risk, based on several studies conducted over the past decade using in-vehicle cameras and sensors to monitor a sample of drivers. Drivers who manipulate cell phones were twice to six times more likely to crash than when they weren't distracted. But none of the data available shows a crash rate like that cited by Ivers. In April 2019, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration - while noting data concerns regarding inconsistent reporting among police agencies - reported that the dispersed command accounted for 9 per cent of the 2017 fatal incidents in the United States. Their analysis of the data of the crash report showed that 1.2 per cent of fatal collisions related to the use of cellular phones as distraction (401 out of 34,247). The latest Safety Council statistics collected on text messages do not meet Evers' claim. Based on 2013 data, the 2015 Safety Board analysis found cellular phones to be operating in 26% of all collisions, the same year before. But the text messages were only 6% of crashes. The other 20% were classified as \"modern.\" More recent data focus on drivers &apos; behaviors rather than directly linking them to collision frequency. According to the Department of Traffic Safety, the number of drivers clearly manipulating mobile phones - based on a surveillance survey - has increased slightly since then. However, the use of hand-held phones (without counting hand-free devices) has generally decreased from 4.6 per cent in 2013 to 2.9 per cent in 2017. A safety board survey conducted in 2016 revealed that 32 per cent of drivers were willing to review or send text messages from time to time, and that 20 per cent to 25 per cent said that they were willing to review or send e-mails, check social media, or use the Internet. No evidence was provided by the spokesperson for Evers to support the allegation of correspondence and driving. Our rule (Evers) said in a tweet that text messages and command were due to one in four incidents across the country. The general point is that dispersed leadership is a major and deadly problem. The use of the telephone is an essential part of this. But the statistics he used to explain this point are wrong. Experts say that we do not have enough data to show how many collisions are currently associated with text messages. The latest attempt to do so using 2013 data showed that only 6 per cent of collisions were directly related to text messages - much less than Evers claimed. We value this allegation wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00221"}
