Steve Rothman. \u00a0\n\n\"Currently it costs more than a penny for the U.S. Mint to make a one cent coin and more than a nickel to make the five cent piece,\" Rothman (D-9th Dist.) said in a statement submitted to the Congressional Record on Nov. 2. Rothman\u2019s statement called attention to an opinion article in the New York Times written by a Bergen County freeholder that suggested alternate materials \u00a0for penny production.\n\nPolitiFact New Jersey found the congressman is right on the money.\n\nThe total cost to produce and distribute a penny in 2010 was 1.79 cents, according to the U.S. Mint\u2019s most recent annual report.\n\nA nickel cost the government 9.22 cents.\n\nOverall, the U.S. Mint lost \u00a0$42.6 million on the more than 3.48 billion pennies and 359 million nickels produced and distributed in fiscal year 2010.\n\nThe government has been losing money on producing these smaller denomination coins since 2006, when a rise in the price of the metals used to make the coins increased the overall production costs, according to annual reports.\n\nThe Mint\u2019s most recent annual report said that \"changing the composition of coins to less expensive alternative materials could generate significant cost savings.\" The composition of the penny and nickel is set by statute.\n\n\"In 1982, the penny composition changed from copper alloy (95% copper, 5% zinc) to copper plated zinc (total content 97.5% zinc, 2.5% copper),\" Gordon Hume, a spokesman for the U.S. Mint told us in an email. \"The nickel has remained unchanged since 1866 at 75% copper, 25% nickel. The only exception was from 1942 to 1945 when the nickel was 56% copper, 35% silver, 9% manganese.\"\n\nThis summer the Mint contracted Concurrent Technologies Corporation, a Johnstown, Pa.-based company, to research and recommend less expensive metallic materials for coin production.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that while the U.S. Mint is losing money on pennies and nickels, it\u2019s still turning a profit on higher denomination coins.\n\nIn 2010, dimes cost 5.69 cents to produce and distribute, quarters cost 12.78 cents and dollar coins went for 31.57 cents.\n\nOur ruling\n\nRothman claimed it costs more for the U.S. Mint to produce a penny and nickel than the face value of the coins.\n\nIt costs 1.79 cents to produce and distribute every penny the Mint makes. And every nickel costs 9.22 cents.\n\nSo, you can bank on those numbers. We rate the congressman\u2019s statement True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-12041"}
