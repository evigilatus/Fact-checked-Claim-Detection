One of Romano's statistics was that \"to cope with inflation, the average household income in West Virginia has not grown in a decade.\" We've verified two other statements from his article that turned out to be true. Is the last one on the stagnating income right? We turned into official federal data from the Census Bureau to find out. These data show that the average inflation-adjusted household income in West Virginia in 2007 was $49,885 - the culmination of a decade and a half of fixed gains above inflation. On December 15, 2010, Gwen Moore reported in a weekly interview with the newspaper \"I represent the fourth poorest province in the country. \u2022 3 January 2011, but a decade later, the 2007 figure remains the highest average income in the State since the statistics were first recorded in 1984. During that decade, average income declined by 9 per cent in the calculation of inflation. 2018 data not yet available.) The nation as a whole has experienced some stagnation in income since 1999, but nothing as severe as West Virginia. At the national level, average income has increased each year since 2014 and reached its highest level ever in 2017. Compared to the specific years used by Romano, 2007 to 2017 the national figure rose by 3 per cent. The Governor Romano wrote that \"the adjustment to inflation, the average household income in West Virginia has not grown in a decade.\" The average inflation-adjusted income in West Virginia declined by 9 per cent in the last decade, even with the national figure rising by 3 per cent. We're assessing his statement right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01197"}
