Under @BarakObama, illegal migration has fallen to the lowest level for 50 years (see this). For the first time, we enacted a law on pre-existing conditions close to full health care coverage. We have recovered from a global economic collapse. I can go on. But @JoeBiden was there too. - Nate_McMurray (@Nate_McMurray) September 10, 2019 immigration is still a subject for Americans to talk about, so we wanted to see if McMurray was right. His instructions to \"seek him\" struck us as an invitation to verify the facts. What the superintendent of the Greater Island intended as \"illegal migration\" is still unclear. His spokesman did not make that clear to us. Demographics studying migration look at data from several sources to see how many people are crossing the border illegally and how many are entering it legally and then exceeding their visas. They also consider how the United States population living in the United States without permission is changing over time. This number increases and decreases as more undocumented migrants enter the country while others die, become citizens or leave the country. McMurray responded to the Twitter user asking for evidence of his claim, tweeting the link with a report from the Centre for Post-immigration Studies. In the report, \"The undocumented population of the United States fell severely during the Obama era: estimates for 2016,\" author Robert Warren found that the undocumented population had fallen to 10.8 million in 2016, the last full year of office, the lowest level since 2003. The report does not return to 50 years. This indicates that the undocumented population has at some point been much less than that. Using data for 18 countries representing 88 per cent of the undocumented population, the report shows that the undocumented population in 1990 was 3.5 million and in 2000 it was 8.6 million. Another study, from the Pio Center for Non-Party Research, found that the number of unauthorized migrants peaked in 2007, before Obama took office, reaching 12.2 million and falling to 10.5 million in 2017, immediately after leaving the presidency. The United States Department of Homeland Security uses a different methodology to calculate the number of unauthorized migrants, which is estimated to have increased on average by 70,000 persons per year between 2010 and 2015. The Demographic and Health Survey estimates that 12 million unauthorized migrants were living in the United States in January 2015, compared to 11.5 million in January 2014 and 11.6 million in January 2010, according to a report published in December. We have met with five people studying migration trends, some from think tanks with different perspectives on migration and others who conduct research but do not take policy positions. Many of these experts use government data on the concerns of unauthorized persons in the United States to measure irregular migration, although they cautioned that the data was not an ideal measure. According to the United States Department of Homeland Security, the number of annual arrests of foreigners, defined by the Department as persons who are not citizens or citizens, was 462,388 under Obama in 2015. The highest number of concerns during Obama &apos; s presidency was 889,212 in 2009. This figure includes arrests by United States border patrols and administrative arrests by immigration and customs authorities. Before 2015, the Department recorded fewer concerns 44 years ago. In 1971, 420,126 arrests were recorded. After Obama left office, the number of concerns has decreased so far. In 2017, the first year of President Donald Trump &apos; s office, concerns fell to 461,540 cases. The United States Border Patrol also reports its annual concerns, a subset of the data of the Department of Homeland Security. The concerns at the borders during Obama &apos; s administration were also the lowest in 2015, reaching 337,117 cases. Before 2015, border arrests were lower in 1971, with 302,517 cases. In 2017, border arrests fell to 310,531. In less than 50 years, according to Jeffrey Basil, a senior demographer with a non-partisan Pio Research Centre, fears are expressed by Mexicans on the south-western border. However, Bassel said that although fears of Mexicans on the south-western border were declining, research from Pyo showed that persons who might have exceeded their visa stay constituted a large majority of unauthorized immigrants since 2010. On February 1, 2021, Tom Cotton mentioned in an interview with Fox and friends \"Many of these arriving immigrants, we have no way of checking their background for either health or security.\" \u2022 On February 3, 2012, several demographers warned that concerns were only a rough indication of illegal immigration, not just because arrests did not reveal the exact number of people crossing the border without permission and remaining. A research published in January by the Centre for Migration Studies found \"visits that have greatly exceeded the limits during each of the last seven years.\" Jessica Vaughn, Director of Policy at the Centre for Migration Studies, who prefers low-migration, said that there were problems in comparing arrest data over the past 50 years because of changes in the way American border patrols deter illegal border crossings. Decades ago, the same people tried several times before they crossed, as she said. She also said that statistics on the number of arrests represented juveniles rather than persons, and that the same person could be arrested several times. When we pursued the McMurray campaign to obtain further evidence of his claim, his spokesperson, Nicole Hoschla, said that McMurray had heard the statistics on the MSNBC \"Morning of Joe.\" No further questions have been answered as to whether McMurray is talking about arrests of undocumented persons at the border or about undocumented populations living in the United States. The experts with whom we spoke provided mixed views on whether McMurray &apos; s allegation was accurate. Warren, who had previously worked for the Census Bureau and had written many widely cited research, said in an interview that he believed McMurray's claim to be \"generally correct,\" based on the same statements of fear. \"In fact, if someone wanted to manipulate the statement, undocumented migration might have been lower in the late 1960s and early 1970s than in the latter part of Obama's administration; it was higher than the mid-1970s to the latter part of Obama's administration - about 40 years.\" Some experts said that McMurray &apos; s claim was largely true, based on the fears of persons seeking to enter the country illegally, in particular arrests at the southern border. However, these figures do not include visa overruns, which are a major source of illegal migration. \"If you define it as meaning the size of the unauthorized immigrant population, which is not accurate,\" said Michelle Metelstadt, Director of Communications at the Institute of Migration Policy, who supports liberal immigration policies. \"The overall unauthorized population in the United States was at heights close to the record during the inception of Obama's administration and while it declined somewhat, the population remains much larger than it was 50 years ago.\" A researcher with the American Immigration Reform Union, which supports Tramp's immigration policies, noted the size of the number of unauthorized migrants in the Obama era. Even when illegal migration was the lowest in the Obama era, the population was still almost three times greater than in 1990, as Spencer Raleigh, the Federation's leading research partner, said. Riley also believes that the size of this population is too low because the Government has difficulty collecting accurate data. Our rule, McMurray, is that during Obama's administration, illegal immigration has fallen to its lowest level in 50 years. Nothing in the data we have reviewed indicates that this is true. :: During the eight-year term of Obama &apos; s presidency, fears of people who were in the country without permission fell to levels not seen since 1971. The concerns do not constitute an accurate measure of the number of individuals entering and residing in the country when they are not authorized to do so, and do not include persons whose stay exceeds their visas. However, immigration researchers use this data to develop estimates of irregular migration. But even if McMurray said concerns, his statement would still be problematic. In November 2014, Obama said, \"Generally, the number of people trying to cross our borders illegally is at its lowest level since the 1970s.\" Bolivi Fruitte found his statement half correct. While Polyte Fact found Obama to be right in the absolute numbers of persons arrested trying to cross the border in 2013 and in the 1970s, experts noted that Obama created an incomplete comparison because the border situation was significantly different in 1970 than in 2013. In the 1970s, it was easier for people to make multiple attempts or trips across borders illegally. Demographics use the size of illegal immigrants residing in the United States to measure trends in irregular migration. This population was significantly lower decades ago, based on available data, than it was during the Obama administration, although some studies have shown that this number has declined over the past 10 years. We're assessing McMurray's claim mostly wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00135"}
