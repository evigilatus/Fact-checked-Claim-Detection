A comprehensive bill containing various proposals for elections is being drafted by State legislators, one of which seeks to reduce the number of weeks allowed for early voting from two weeks to one week. The Republicans commend this measure as an effective step, while Democrats say that the draft law can deprive voters of their right to vote. Miguel D\u00edaz de la Portia, a Miami Republican, cited the reasons for his endorsement of this measure during the meeting of the Senate Rules Committee on 15 April 2011. In general, early voting in Miami-Dade was not very effective, as stated by Diaz de la Portia, as stated by the St. Petersburg Times Office/Miami Herald Talahasi. \"What you see more than ever is that there are a handful of two or three people a day at a very high cost to keep those public libraries and ballots open. We felt it was the measure of efficiency.\" We wondered if Diaz de la Portilla's low participation number was correct for people sneaking into Miami-Dade's early 20 voting sites. First, some background information on early voting. This option became available to voters in Florida in 2004, in response to the flawed presidential election of 2000. Legislators pledged to leave as much room as possible for error after that vote, as voters complained about the complex voting processes and their removal from crowded voting places. In Miami-Dade, 1,205,770 voters were registered for the 2010 general elections in November (including 368,221 Republicans and 532,095 Democrats). Of all these votes, 97,076 voted early on in November 2, which included the United States Senate race, the Governor, the State Council of Ministers and constitutional amendments. We called Diaz de la Portilla Talahasi's office looking for a comment from the senator, but we didn't hear a reply. However, we received a response from the Miami-Dade election administration when we asked about early voting statistics. The Electoral Administration provided us with a number of early votes from seven recent elections. These were the initial and general elections in 2006; the initial presidential elections, the regular initial elections and the general elections in 2008; and the initial and general elections in 2010. You can find them all here. While some sites are more crowded than others, we have been able to find only two cases in which the number of voters on a given day has been reduced to one - probably because of Tropical Storm Ernesto, not because of shortcomings. On 29 August 2006, the early vote was suspended for one day as the storm passed through South Florida. On August 30, only eight people appeared to vote in Florida City Hall and five in Miami City Hall. Each of the other sites had low numbers that day, possibly as a result of weather distractions. For other dates during those seven elections, daily votes in different locations ranged from 13 to 3,324. More recently, in the November elections, the lowest number of voters was 80, registered at the Lemon City Library on 23 October. For all 20 sites over the early 14-day polling period, an average of 117 votes were cast in the 2010 primary elections and 346 in the 2010 general elections. If, as each electoral cycle passes, the fact is that the number of voters casting early votes has increased. For example, during the 2006 general elections, 66,192 voters voted at an early polling site to decide between the then Republic of Croatia and Democratic Jim Davis for the post of Governor. This number rose to 326,492 early in the 2008 presidential election when Barack Obama Sen defeated the Republican John McCain. It is recognized that presidential elections usually enjoy greater participation, but even during the 2010 Senate and Governorial elections, 97,076 voters went to early polling sites - 47 per cent more than the 2006 elections. \"Many of it relates to the communication that we do in society, and people are more aware that every year before that early voting is an option,\" said the spokesman for the Miami-Dade elections, Christina White. It cost Miami-Dade about $2,000 a day, per location, for an early vote, as Wyatt said. For 20 sites over 14 days, this is $560,000. When Wyatt was asked whether Diaz de la Portilla's figures of two to three voters per day seemed accurate, he said: \"I think the data tables speak for themselves.\" During the 2008 presidential elections, early polling sites were so crowded that voters usually waited on lines around libraries and city halls where early voting took place. \"Paparazzi waited more than four hours to get their vote at the Aventura State Center,\" according to the articles Nov 3, 2008, Miami Herald detailing long waitings. The lines and waiting periods at some early voting sites in Miami-Dade were so long that the Electoral Department eventually established a link on its website to update the waiting times at each site. \"At 3 p.m. at the Miami-Dade government center, the line was hundreds of powerful men making their way through the open-air Plaza,\" according to Nov 2, 2008, the Miami Herald article. Big golf umbrellas came out of the crowd, first pouring people out of the rain and then the sun. Some people in line checked waiting times from PDAs. I think we're going to Aventura. While there were cases of early voter turnout falling below the two figures, those cases concerned poor weather conditions. In general, early voting in Miami-Dade province has grown steadily in each electoral cycle, with some locations equipping more than 3,000 voters. Based on the figures provided to us by the Miami-Dade election administration, we found no cases of \"two or three voters\" appearing at the early polling site, as Diaz de la Portia claimed. We value this allegation wrong. He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. \u2022 January 12, 2012", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13193"}
