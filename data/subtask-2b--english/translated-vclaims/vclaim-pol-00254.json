There is a reason why the wealthy in Canada donate to hospitals https://t.co/seszdD8Pu - Mark Kobe (@mcuban) August 15, 2019 \"When wealthy Canadians donate to hospitals not only send a check,\" followed by another tweet. \"They meet the best people in the hospital and get #s. \"They get their standard dress early and with more attention.\" But when rich Canadians donate to hospitals, they don't just send a check. They meet the best people in the hospital and get their numbers, they're already calling. They get their standard case dress sooner and with more attention. Even in Canada, it's smart to keep donors happy. https://t.co/Rq1ic6Nzrz - Mark Kobe (@mcuban) 15 August 2019. Do wealthy Canadians donate to hospitals for better treatment? Cuba &apos; s tweeting made it seem like a normal operating procedure. It seemed suspicious to us, so we communicated and asked the Cubans, who once flirted with running for president, what evidence he had to support his claim. \"Lol,\" he said. \"No. I'm not gonna catch the people I talked to.\" Cuba stated that the aim of its Twitter thread was to generate debate about the advantages and disadvantages of health-care systems in the United States and Canada. :: (It is proposed that insurance companies be abolished and that federal funds be used to pay for more medical personnel, each CNBC.) He asked us to ask the major hospitals in Canada whether they gave donors call numbers to arrange better treatment. So we did. We also spoke to a number of experts. In summary: Cuba may know some wealthy Canadians who have doctors on the highway because they gave money to build a building, buy new equipment, or carry out funding research. However, as a general rule, Canadian hospitals do not grant special privileges to wealthy donors. He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. \u2022 12 January 2021 Canada &apos; s health care system, generally provided by private doctors and hospitals but paid from public funds. This is why democratic politicians like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders praised Canada as a model of what one-person health care might look like in the United States. The provinces and territories are in the driver &apos; s seat, but the Federal Government helps to defray the costs and decides on the services that the provinces must provide to receive federal funds. Canadians do not pay from their own funds for necessary medical care, which is defined as visits to a doctor or hospital. However, the majority of Canadians buy supplementary private insurance to cover prescription drugs, dental care and other services. We will not exclude the possibility for Cubans to know those who feel that their donations gave them a high hand with their own hospital or doctor. However, representatives of hospitals and health policy experts told us that while there may be isolated cases of donors receiving preferential treatment, these scenarios are highly unlikely and may be contrary to federal law. Do donors get better treatment? We contacted press offices to obtain a number of Canada's largest hospitals from several different provinces. Many of them didn't answer. However, those who did so were skeptical of Cuba &apos; s claim. Shaf Hussain, a health-care spokesman in Providence, who runs hospitals throughout British Columbia, including St. Paul &apos; s Hospital in Vancouver, said. (St. Paul received a record contribution of $75 million from billion in 2017) \"We have a very generous donor community, and we are always grateful for any support for equipment or research,\" said Hussein. \"But no, this does not lead to any kind of special treatment or access to health care.\" Hussein and Ted Marmore, Professor of Public Policy and Administration at Yale University, said that giving priority to donors would violate the Federal Health Act of Canada, which stresses the importance of \"facilitating reasonable access to health services without financial or other barriers.\" Marmore said: \"As a general description of Canadian hospital practice, (Cuba's claim) are legends.\" \"Some patients have been involved in seeking a faster service with donations is undoubtedly true. But this is an exaggerated picture of admission to the hospital.\" Other Canadian experts agreed. Antonia Mayoni, Professor of Political Science at McGill University in Montreal, said: \"Donors are offered to hospitals as recognition marks, investment in infrastructure or equipment, or investment in specific types of hospital research.\" \"There's no trade\" \"There is no direct relationship between whether you contribute and the care you receive,\" he added Raisa Deber, Professor of Public Health Policy at the University of Toronto. For what it's worth, donations are not \"an important source of funding for Canadian hospitals,\" as Marmore said. According to the World Health Organization, 70 per cent of Canada &apos; s total health expenditure comes from public tax revenues collected by different levels of government. The ruling Cubans said, \"The lowly people in Canada are donating to hospitals\" for better treatment. It is possible for Cuba to know some of the persons who claim to have received special treatment, but representatives of hospitals and health policy experts have told us that Cuba &apos; s claim is an inaccurate description of what is happening in Canadian hospitals in general. It is also contrary to Canadian law, which provides that people should have access to care regardless of finances. We're evaluating this statement mostly wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00254"}
