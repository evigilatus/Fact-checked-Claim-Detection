It shows a woman named Darlene Blake of De Moyen, Iowa, who speaks of the importance of medical care. \"Bruce Braley voted to cut $700 billion in medical care to support Obama's care,\" says Blake. \"That's not fair. We paid. We paid for it. This must be there for us.\" In verifying the facts separately, we considered the allegation that Berley \"voted to cut $700 billion in medical care to support Obama's care.\" Here, we will consider the claim that reductions in medical care affect those who \"have already paid.\" We paid for it.\" The announcement has the point that Americans 65 and above \"paid in\" to medical care through their salary taxes throughout their working lives. At present, workers pay a 1.45 per cent salary tax for medical care, while employers pay an additional 1.45 per cent. Self-employed workers pay both parts of the tax. In the meantime, as of 2013, households receiving $125,000 (or $200,000 or $250,000, depending on the number of people in the household and their tax-reimbursement status) pay an additional tax of 0.9 per cent for medical care. However, it is not as if those taxes on salaries are calculated for the future use of that beneficiary alone. Instead, tax revenues on salaries paid by workers of all ages (with the proceeds of current medical care premiums for beneficiaries) are billed for medical care costs for today &apos; s beneficiaries. In the way mathematics has gone over the years, today's beneficiaries have returned to spending much more on medical care than they put into the system through their tax payments. We discussed this topic in 2013, using statistics from the Urban Institute, a non-partisan research institute in Washington. We will summarize their findings here, which have been updated with the latest data. Researchers at the Institute have discovered what people who have reached the age of 65 have paid in different years of the system and what they can expect to \"take\" after they have reached the age of 65. Since marital status and family income can have a significant impact on both the amount paid and the amount paid, the Institute provides accounts for the various types of family units. In order to make the final amounts similar to what would have been done with tax funds had it been invested from the private sector, the Institute adjusted all dollar figures by two percentage points above the inflation rate. (The authors note that the different assumptions of long-term investment returns will change the results. We looked at the statistics for three old Kurt -- those who were 65 years old in 2000, 2005 and 2010. This means that they are 79, 74 and 69 today. We found that, for the beneficiaries of medical care, a \"worst\" deal for any of these demographic groups is still very generous. A couple of learners, one with high earnings and the other with average earnings, aged 65 in 2010, would have paid $158,000 in medical care taxes over their lifetime, but they could be expected to receive $385,000 in medical care expenses. This is $2.40 per dollar tax-paid benefit -- and this is the least generous percentage we've ever found. On January 13, 2021, bloggers announced the extraordinary truth-checking story in which General David H. Berger, the commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for the use of marines for inaugural security, and told her that we were \"not working for you.\" On January 17, 2021, the highest percentage was for couples with a single gain, with a gain of 65 years in 2000 and an average wage paid. These spouses would have paid $39,000 in medical care taxes but would have expected to benefit from $306,000 - $7.80 in medical care expenses for each dollar paid by the spouses. So the allegation of advertising -- that medical care cuts is \"just not fair. We paid. We've paid for it -- it's too much. For the typical recipient of medical care today, what they paid the system represents only 13 per cent to 41 per cent of what they can expect to get out of. The rest are financed through the payroll taxes of younger Americans. The fact that taxes paid by active workers today support the retirement generation is a major cause of concern for some policy makers about the ability of the programme to meet its long-term obligations. In 1950, the average age of Americans was 68, and retirees were supported by 16 workers. Now, life expectancy is 78 years and only three workers support each retiree. By the time mid-life workers reach retirement age, there will be only two workers around to support their benefits. The promised interest will exceed income by approximately 30 per cent, and there will be no reliable trust fund funds. \"The problem with a quote from the announcement is that he has no number,\" said C. Eugene Stoerl, who helped compile the accounts of the Urban Institute. \"We paid for it\" does not say what \"we paid\" or what it is, because the program is constantly expanding over time. Sturel added: \"We paid our parents for medical care. There is little money in trust funds. The issue is what we believe we must expect from our children, which requires consideration of cost and benefits.\" The ad says that cuts in medical care affect people who \"have already paid\" We paid for it.\" While Americans have already \"paid\" for medical care, the amount paid today by the beneficiaries covers only a fraction of their expected costs. The taxes paid by ordinary beneficiaries today will cover only 13 to 41 per cent of what they can expect from medical care during their lifetime. The rest of what was paid for their care came from young Americans. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that give a different impression, so it is often wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07331"}
