There are currently no FDA-approved medicines specifically for COVID-19. (Chloroquine is chemically similar to hydroxychloroquine, but it is a different drug that\u2019s primarily used to treat malaria. Both carry a particular risk for people with heart problems, plus other possible side effects.)\nNow, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have been thrust back into the spotlight as misinformation about the drugs\u2019 effectiveness and safety recently reappeared online.\nRELATED: Don\u2019t fall for this video: Hydroxychloroquine is not a COVID-19 cure\nOne such post on Facebook falsely claims that Americans have been deceived because health officials at the National Institutes of Health have known all along that chloroquine is effective against \"COVID.\"\u00a0\nThe post reads:\n\u00a0\"N.I.H. 15 years ago published a study on chloroquine. It is effective against COVID-(1). We are being lied to America!\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nThis is flawed.\u00a0\nFirst, there\u2019s no such thing as \"COVID-1.\" COVID-19 was named for the year it was discovered, not because it\u2019s the 19th iteration.\u00a0\nSecond, the 2005 study found that chloroquine was effective on primate cells infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome, known as SARS, which is caused by a coronavirus. But while the two share similarities, SARS-CoV and COVID-19 are different diseases, and primate cells are far from human patients.\nThird, the study was indexed by the NIH\u2019s National Library of Medicine, but the NIH was not involved. It was published in the peer-reviewed Virology Journal and conducted by researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Montreal Clinical Research Institute.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 25, 2021 in a blog post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWHO now saying you do not need to wear a mask.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRELATED: Hydroxychloroquine and coronavirus: what you need to know\nWhat the study says\nThe study was published in August 2005 and found that chloroquine has \"strong antiviral effects on SARS-CoV infection of primate cells\" and that it was effective on cells treated with the drug before and after exposure to the virus.\nThe drug was not administered to actual SARS patients, and the study\u2019s authors wrote that more research was needed on how the drug interacts with SARS in animal test subjects.\n\"Cell culture testing of an antiviral drug against the virus is only the first step, of many steps, necessary to develop an antiviral drug,\" Kate Fowlie, a spokesperson for the CDC previously told PolitiFact in an email. \"It is important to realize that most antivirals that pass this cell culture test hurdle fail at later steps in the development process.\"\nDr. Alex Greninger, assistant director of clinical virology at the University of Washington School of Medicine, told us that a problem in virology is trying to determine the difference of how drugs work in cell culture in comparison to humans.\n\"Data on chloroquine is largely taken from these cell culture studies, but we now have trials in people on hydroxychloroquine that show it\u2019s not as effective,\" Greninger said, \"and there\u2019s new data out in the last week that suggests that some of the reasons could be because of the cell types that SARS coronaviruses grow in, and this original experiment was done on African green monkey kidney cells, which is not the tissue we are really worried about.\"\nWhat officials say about the drugs now\nThe Food and Drug Administration granted emergency use authorizations for some medicines to be used for certain patients hospitalized with COVID-19, but it revoked the authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in mid-June due to concerns over the drugs\u2019 serious side effects. There are currently no FDA-approved medicines for COVID-19.\u00a0\n\"It is no longer reasonable to believe that oral formulations of HCQ and CQ may be effective in treating COVID-19, nor is it reasonable to believe that the known and potential benefits of these products outweigh their known and potential risks,\" FDA Chief Scientist Denise M. Hinton wrote.\nThe NIH\u2019s COVID-19 treatment guidelines, which were developed to inform clinicians on how to care for patients with COVID-19, also currently recommend against the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 treatment, except in a clinical trial.\nBut even those trials have been halted. The World Health Organization and the NIH announced in mid-June that they would stop hydroxychloroquine patient trials, citing safety concerns that include serious heart rhythm problems, blood and lymph system disorders, kidney injuries, and liver problems and failure.\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post says that the NIH published a study 15 years ago that showed chloroquine was effective against \"COVID-(1)\" and that health officials have been lying to the American people.\nThis is wrong. There\u2019s no such thing as \"COVID-1\" and the study cited was not published by the NIH and had to do with animal cells infected with SARS, not COVID-19. The drug was not given to human patients and the study\u2019s authors said more research was needed.\nHealth officials caution against the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 patients, citing the possibility of serious side effects. There are currently no approved treatments for the virus.\nWe rate this False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17814"}
