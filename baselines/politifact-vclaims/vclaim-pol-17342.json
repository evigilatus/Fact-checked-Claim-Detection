They were first identified in the mid-1960s and some of the viruses are common, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\u00a0\nThe strain of coronavirus spreading from Wuhan, China, is categorized as the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV). According to the World Health Organization, a novel coronavirus\u00a0 is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. The 2019 strain was first reported from Wuhan on Dec. 31.\u00a0\nAs of Feb. 4, more than 20,000 cases have been confirmed globally. Deaths total 426, with only one occurring outside of China.\nSome cleaning product labels mention \"human coronavirus\" because those surface products have been proven effective against past strains of coronavirus. On its website, Lysol has a section dedicated to the coronavirus. It says that specific Lysol products, including its disinfectant spray, \"have demonstrated effectiveness against viruses similar to 2019 Novel coronavirus (2019-n-CoV) on hard, non-porous surfaces.\" (Again, this is only when used to clean surfaces; such products should never be ingested!)\nThis Facebook post falsely assumes that because the label for Lysol disinfectant spray includes mention of its effectiveness against \"coronavirus,\" media descriptions of a current outbreak as being caused by a new virus are \"B.S.\" But that assumption is wrong. The Lysol spray has demonstrated effectiveness against past strains of coronavirus. The current outbreak spreading from Wuhan, China, is caused by a previously unidentified strain known as the 2019 Novel coronavirus. Cleaning products that list coronavirus on their labels are not referring to this strain.\nWe rate this Facebook post False.\nDaniel Funke contributed to this report.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17342"}
