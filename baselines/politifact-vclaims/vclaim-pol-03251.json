Nicaragua said it wasn't tough enough. What's Trump's excuse?\u2014 D Wasserman Schultz (@DWStweets) June 1, 2017\n\nTrump\u2019s promise to \"cancel\" the Paris Agreement is one of more than 100 promises we are tracking on the Trump-O-Meter.\nNews outlets reported that Trump was leaning toward exiting the global agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and keep global average temperature increases below 2 degrees Celsius.\nWasserman Schultz tweet left us wondering if she was right about only two nations \u2014 Syria and Nicaragua \u2014 not signing the agreement, and that the Central American nation refused to sign because the agreement \"wasn\u2019t tough enough.\" Information from the United Nations and statements by Nicaraguan representatives support her statement. \u00a0\nThe Paris Agreement\nThe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was adopted in 1992 and entered into force in 1994. It consists of 197 Parties (196 States and 1 regional economic integration organization). Among them are the United States, Syria and Nicaragua.\nThe UNFCCC\u2019s ultimate goal is \"preventing \u2018dangerous\u2019 human interference with the climate system,\" that includes greenhouse gas concentrations, according to the UNFCCC\u2019s website.\nParties to the UNFCCC during a December 2015 session in Paris adopted the Paris Agreement, seeking \"to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change.\" One of the objectives is to hold the increase in global average temperature well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.\nA total of 175 parties signed the agreement on April 22, 2016, according to information from the UN. The agreement remained opened for signatures from April 22, 2016, to April 21, 2017. The latest nation to sign was Uzbekistan, on April 19.\nOverall total signatories: 195.\u00a0\nThe only countries in the world that did not sign: Syria and Nicaragua.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Paris Agreement came into effect in November 2016 after 55 countries accounting for at least 55 percent of total global greenhouse gas emissions formally ratified the agreement. So far, 147 parties have ratified the agreement.\nWasserman Schultz office referred us to several news reports indicating that if the United States abandons the Paris agreement, it would join Syria and Nicaragua as nonparticipants.\nReuters in December 2015 reported that Nicaragua objected to the climate agreement \"saying it did not do enough to protect \u2018Mother Earth,\u2019 in a symbolic protest after the deal had been formally adopted.\"\nThe news agency noted that Paul Oquist, head of the Nicaraguan delegation at the December 2015 session, said wealthy nations should do more to reduce their emissions. Nicaragua also had said developed nations were \"not doing enough to reduce their use of carbon and are not providing sufficient funding to help the developed world adapt to the impact of climate change,\" Reuters reported.\n\"We\u2019re not going to submit because voluntary responsibility is a path to failure,\" Oquist told Climate Home in 2015, a media organization covering climate news. He added: \"It\u2019s a not a matter of being troublemakers, it\u2019s a matter of the developing countries surviving.\"\nIn September 2016, a Spanish-language post by the United Nations also said that the Nicaraguan vice president, Mois\u00e9s Omar Halleslevens Acevedo, had reiterated his nation\u2019s concerns on global warming but did not believe the Paris Agreement would prevent the worsening of the global issue.\n\"Many of us concur that what was agreed in Paris is not sufficient,\" and more ambitious actions are urgent, Halleslevens Acevedo told the UN General Assembly in September 2016.\nNicaraguan media have also reported that Nicaragua\u2019s absence from the agreement is due to its concerns over the agreement, not out of lack of concern for climate change.\nAmid a civil war since 2011, Syria\u2019s participation in the agreement has been difficult because members of the Syrian government are subject to European and American sanctions.\nOur ruling\nWasserman Schultz tweeted, \"Syria and Nicaragua are the only nations that didn't sign the Paris Agreement. Nicaragua said it wasn't tough enough.\"\nA total 195 of the 197 parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change signed the Paris Agreement. That includes all the countries in the world, except Syria and Nicaragua.\nNicaraguan representatives have said the Paris Agreement is \"not sufficient\" and believe rich nations should do more to reduce their emissions.\nWe rate Wasserman Schultz\u2019 claim True.\n Share the Facts 2017-06-01 18:26:14 UTC   PolitiFact    6 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: True  \"Syria and Nicaragua are the only nations that didn't sign the Paris Agreement.
