A man wearing a ski mask confronted him outside the bank and demanded money. When David Mayne tried to escape, the thief shot him fatally outside the bank entrance and fled. Since then, three accomplices have been indicted. The Head of State (Stephan Ochi) is now sponsoring legislation requiring all banks to \"keep security video cameras covering all customer doors, ATMs and night deposit warehouses.\" \"If that bank had requested the installation of security cameras outside its building years ago, the victim might still be alive today,\" said Oxy in a statement. \"The main objective of the thief is to enter and exit the bank or ATM as soon as possible without being identified. The surveillance camera that captures the offender &apos; s face and other identifiable qualities will certainly discourage attempts to steal and act as a deterrent to thieves. The killing of Maine, the father and husband, provoked anger and the call for the death penalty. Ochie told us he introduced his legislation after he spoke to Maine's employer who told him about the murder. The police had not asked him to follow up on the bill and he had not looked into the matter. While we understand his motives, we wondered: does video surveillance deter thefts in banks? We often see surveillance images of thieves - some disguised, some unconvincing - who have not been stopped by the cameras placed prominently in the banks. So we looked for some evidence. At the outset, we learned that 5,628 bank robberies at the national level (including very few thefts and thefts) were reported to the FBI in 2010. More than 90 per cent of the time was looted. These crimes resulted in 106 injuries and 16 deaths. Of the banks targeted in these cases, 5,543, or 98 per cent, had some form of video surveillance. This is very few thieves who were not surprised by visual surveillance. Did many refrain from robbing banks because of video cameras? There is no study that shows this, as far as we know. We found an enlightening report written by Deborah Lam Weizel, Director of Police Research, Department of Political Science and Public Administration, North Carolina State University. Its 2007 text on bank theft of the non-profit centre for problem-oriented policing was created and appears on the website of the United States Department of Justice. It is noted and eliminated that the number of accidents has increased significantly since the 1960s, with banks increasing their hours and branches. \"Bank robbers are usually fast, low-risk crimes, because employees are trained to comply with the thief's demands,\" as written. When introducing measures that increase the \"risk perception\" of the thief, I mentioned the employment of security guards, the hiring of personnel to receive clients and the enforcement of policies prohibiting solar caps and glasses within the bank. She did not include electronic surveillance. Cameras don't seem to be reducing the thefts. Many bank robbers don't stop because they simply don't think they're gonna get caught. Others believe that cameras can be frustrated by disguise or secret behaviour or that cameras can be disabled like spray paint; or that they simply don't think about cameras at all, Wessel's books. Surveillance helped \"to identify and arrest suspects and could also assist in prosecution.\" Douglas Johnson, Vice-President of the Risk Management Policy of the American Banking Association, agreed. \"I have always heard and thought that cameras are not a deterrent measure. He said that the cameras and the video were there specifically for the purposes of arrest.\" The cameras are already in all ATMs, as noted, and do not prevent ATM offences. William Farrell, Legislative Council of the Bankers Association of Rhode Island, testified against the Ochi Bill in the State House due to civil freedom concerns and other matters. When he interviewed him, he said that industry experts did not view surveillance as a \"defensive tool.\" We found an article in 2009 in which representatives of the Executive Security Council, a risk mitigation research and services organization, wrote that \"the parking cameras... can help identify the perpetrators before they put their masks on. It can also act as a deterrent.\" But authors emphasize fear, and only add that video surveillance \"could also be a deterrent.\" When Ochie told us about our results, he said his intention was not only to prevent bank robbery, but also to prevent clients. External surveillance could deter thieves from attacking customers abroad, as well as providing information on the identity and escape of the thief. There is no doubt that Ochi sincerely wants to prevent another tragic death, such as that of David Maine. And police officials in Providence and Wonsocket told us that video surveillance certainly helps catch thieves and send them to prison. But we didn't find any evidence that outdoor surveillance deters customer theft. The experts with whom we consulted question their deterrent value. We're assessing Ucci's false claim. Marco Rubio stated on 27 January 2021 in his remarks: \"Only in the Third World do you see this routine use of trials of former leaders.\" It was $12,542.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13144"}
