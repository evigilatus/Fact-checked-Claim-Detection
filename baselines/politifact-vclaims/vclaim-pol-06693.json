High School Forced To Recite Islamic Prayer, Make Prayer Rugs.\"\nWe don\u2019t mean to pick on this one site -- because there are many, many other places that have reblogged the report -- and the writer did update the story after we asked him some questions. But the headline encapsulated the alleged events that have outraged so many people. Were students forced to recite an Islamic prayer and make prayer rugs at Lyman High School? PolitiFact Florida did our own homework.\nTaking notes\nWagner met with Seminole County Public Schools administrators on Oct. 17, 2014, to discuss concerns about his son\u2019s 10th grade world history class. Wagner alleged the class had been told to recite the first of the five pillars of Islam as printed in their textbook -- \"There is no god, but God. Muhammad is the messenger of God.\" The prayer, known as the shahada, is an affirmation of faith among Muslims.\nWagner also complained about 100 pages missing from his son\u2019s history book and assignments to make Islamic prayer rugs and watch videos about Muslims. He said the teacher had contacted his son directly about the assignments via text messages, without his parents\u2019 knowledge.\nWagner\u2019s wife, Lisa Huston, told PolitiFact Florida she and her husband believed the school district was favoring Islam, and that the missing pages were possibly removed deliberately. The textbook, published by Prentice Hall, has been singled out by some Florida and national groups for allegedly being pro-Islam, although it is approved by districts nationwide.\nDistrict executive director of secondary education Michael Blasewitz conducted an investigation in October to determine if Wagner\u2019s allegations were legitimate. Blasewitz concluded the teacher hadn\u2019t violated any rules.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlasewitz repeated to PolitiFact Florida that the state has included Islam in its world history guidelines, and that Judaism and Christianity both are taught during the sixth grade, which the Florida Department of Education confirmed.\nYou can read the entire district investigation report, but here are the highlights.\nText messages: Wagner\u2019s son had enrolled in Remind 101, in which students sign up for a third-party text messaging service for teachers to contact pupils about homework or class events. Blasewitz said parents were allowed to opt in.\nMissing textbook pages: The district found that 68 of the year-old textbooks lost pages from a binding error. Teachers had reported the problem, but Blasewitz said the school didn\u2019t tell the district. Pearson, the publisher, replaced all the faulty copies, he said. (The missing chapters do include more information on Judaism and Christianity in the context of earlier civilizations.)\nVideos: The students watched short videos, including a TED Talk about stereotypes featuring\u00a0an unidentified Iranian-American comedian. While the video did not violate guidelines, the district said a more straightforward selection should be made in future classes.\nPrayer rugs: Students were told to create prayer rugs, but the lesson was an assignment about Islamic art and not worship. The students were told they could incorporate any religious icons they wanted, as long as they observed Islamic artistic values, including no depictions of people or animals. The district said the assignment could be seen as controversial and recommended that a different art assignment \"would be more appropriate.\"\nPrayer recitation: Blasewitz interviewed 10 students in the teacher\u2019s two world history classes, and only one remembered the whole class being made to recite the prayer. Other students recalled following the book together in class, and the teacher gave extra credit to students who volunteered to read aloud. The teacher may have written the pillars of Islam on the board, they said, but did not make the students say any of them.\nHuston insisted to us that at least one other student in a different class period remembered an event similar to her son\u2019s version of events, but Blasewitz said no other complaints had been filed.\nOur ruling\nDownTrend.com\u2019s headline read, \"Students In Fla. High School Forced To Recite Islamic Prayer, Make Prayer Rugs.\" This makes it sound as if students were being indoctrinated into a religion, and that's not the case.\nInstead, students were studying the religion of Islam as part of a world history class.\u00a0According to a district investigation, pupils were assigned to make prayer rugs as an art assignment. The district recommended a different art assignment be made from now on.\nAs for reciting the pillars of Islam in class, only one student complained his class was made to read the shahada. The investigation cited a notable lack of evidence that anyone was forced to recite a prayer.\nThe statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.
