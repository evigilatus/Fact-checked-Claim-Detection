According to Goff, Tony Evers, it is bad enough that the population vote to collect their taxes voluntarily to fund schools in full. \"More than a million people in Wisconsin have voted to raise their own royal taxes because the Republicans have failed to fully fund our government schools over the past eight years,\" Evers tweeted on April 3, 2019. Last year was a record year of school referendums, with voters agreeing to spend more than $2 billion on additional schools. But did a million residents really vote to raise their own taxes through referendums? Is it reasonable to attribute this decision to Republicans who have failed to fund schools fully? Let's study. Referendums are simply rising in Wisconsin, a vote on a specific issue. Local school districts can propose referendums to replace or improve an older or very young building, or to approve expenditure on current budget expenditures beyond what is otherwise permitted. These have risen in recent years. Wisconsin voters approved $1.8 billion in 2016 referendums, recorded a record of over $2 billion in 2018, and voted for another $783 million in the spring of 2019. Overall, voters throughout the state preferred 45 out of 60 referendums in the 2019 spring elections, or 75 per cent. What about a million votes? The spokesman for Evers Melissa in the Duff said that the Governor indicated the number of voters who had supported the referendums since 2012. This data, compiled by the State Ministry of Public Education, includes referendums that exceed expenditure ceilings and build or improve buildings. Some 2 million voters have supported some additional spending since 2012 - 1.1 million voters who supported debt sustainability on buildings, and more than 900,000 additional financial support has been provided to cover current expenditures. In our view, the number of current expenditures is even more important. It represents borrowing of current expenditures, not capital projects such as buildings that are not directly linked to funding levels. However, using only the second scale, there are a million people on the field from Evers. The right to blame Republicans for referendums? A record number of referendums have been approved with the State under the control of the Republic in recent years, but is it fair to link these two facts? On January 26, 2021, Jim Steinke stated on Republican Twitter that they \"come to the table\" and were part of a compromise \"Give and Take\" on the Corona virus bill. \u2022 On January 27, 2012, we will return to the claim of Evers, but first to little evidence of school funding. Local school areas are subject to the state limits established by the former Government of the Republic. (Tommy Thompson) The ceiling - the so-called maximum income - limits the amount of money the province can spend on each pupil. This limit was on average $10,677 per student across the state from 2018 to 1919. The maximum income includes both funds obtained through local property taxes and public school assistance provided by the State to the local provinces. The ceiling on income was initially set for inflation, but over time this has changed. Increases under democratic government have slowed down. Jim Doyle, the border was frozen as of 2015-16 under the Government of the Republic. (Scott Walker) Within the mandate, it has since been frozen. The State has steadily increased public school subsidies in recent years - from $4.49 billion in 2015 to $4.6 billion in 2017 and $4.67 billion in 2019, according to the Wisconsin Policy Forum. However, since the ceiling has not changed, these additional funds simply provided tax relief by reducing the amount of real estate taxes in the provinces that allowed them to tax. This did not result in increased expenditure on each pupil. Therefore, the provinces that wanted to spend beyond the revenue limits needed voters to approve them in a referendum. Which leads us to claim Evers, who was the supervisor of government schools long before he was elected governor. The spokesman for Evers Bladov said that the \"full funding\" part of the tweet indicated that Republicans put poles on school spending. \"At least, the full funding of our schools means allowing school spending to keep pace with inflation, with the contributing State having a fair share of those costs,\" he said in Dave. \"while the former administration eventually returned some of the funding it reduced (State support for costs), it retained relatively stable expenditure. The provinces have had to use the referendums, which are their only available tool, to protect educational programmes, retain staff and keep the lights on.\" So Evers is drawing a direct line from funding levels to a successful referendum. However, there are many factors that can influence whether voters support the referendum. Jason Stein, Director of Research at the Wisconsin Policy Forum, said that other types of government assistance and economic health could be a factor in voters &apos; willingness to support the referendum. For example, aid per pupil - a non-income funding category for public schools - increased from $150 per student in 2015-16 to $654 per student in 2018-19. Of course, there are local factors that play a role in this area - the high or low enrolment rate, age and state of school buildings in the province could have played a role in the unprecedented level of expenditure approved by referendum in recent years. \"You don't usually get standard levels without multiple factors,\" said Stein. \"More than a million Wisconsin residents have voted to raise their own taxes because the Republicans have failed to fund our government schools fully over the past eight years.\" It is not necessarily fair to blame the construction referendums for funding levels - those that are strongly determined by construction conditions and registration trends - but the narrow focus on referendums for continued spending still shows more than 900,000 votes in favour. This is close to Evers' claim of $1 million. However, blaming Republicans in all these referendums simplifys the issue, ignoring other factors that can play a role in the decisions of voters. We appreciate half the integrity.
