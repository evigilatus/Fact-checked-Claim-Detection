He addressed a proposal to eliminate extra points, saying they\u2019re almost automatic (as we previously reported, they are).\nAnd he discussed the health of NFL players amid concern that the sport is too violent.\nGoodell offered a defense that we hadn\u2019t heard before.\n\"Our players are living, on average, longer than the average male,\" Goodell said.\nAfter serious talk about concussions in the NFL and some prominent suicides in the sport, we wondered about Goodell\u2019s claim. It\u2019s accurate, it turns out, but requires some additional explanation.\nThe National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), a government\u00a0research agency within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, studied the mortality rates of former NFL football players in a report released in 2012.\nThe study included nearly all NFL players who played in the league for five or more years from 1959 to 1988 -- a pool of 3,439 men. Researchers said based on current mortality rates, they expected 625 players to be deceased. But by the end of 2007, only 334 were.\n\"We found the players in our study had a much lower rate of death overall compared to men in the general population,\" researchers wrote to the NFL players in a March 2012 letter. \"This means that, on average, NFL players are actually living longer than men in the general \u00a0population.\"\nThe former NFL players also had lower rates of heart disease and cancer compared to average males, the report found.\nThere are a few important caveats to point out.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNFL players aren't like your average male in a number of ways. They are professional athletes, many of whom might be wealthy, and they are likely to\u00a0have access to quality health care.\nThe report also raised red flags.\nResearchers found that men who were considered obese, those with a Body Mass Index of 30 or more when they played, had twice the risk of death from heart disease than other players. African-American players also had a higher heart disease risk than Caucasian players, the report found.\nAnother important note: Because the study excludes modern-day players, it fails to account for the changing physique of today\u2019s football player.\nOf the 3,439 men in the NIOSH study, only 1 percent had a Body Mass Index of 35 or more when they played, and 33 percent had a Body Mass Index between 30 and 35.\nToday\u2019s NFL players are much bigger.\nTo create an example, we looked at the current 53-man roster of the Denver Broncos and calculated each player\u2019s Body Mass Index using a calculator from the National Institutes of Health. Of 53 Broncos players, 13 have a Body Index above 35 (24.5 percent) and another 14 have a Body Mass Index between 30 and 35 (26.4 percent).\nThat\u2019s an important distinction that may affect the results of future studies.\nOur ruling\nGoodell said that NFL \"players are living, on average, longer than the average male.\" His claim is backed up by a government study that examined former NFL players who played from 1959 to 1988.\nBut the study, which was released in 2012, did conclude that bigger players had an increased risk of dying from heart disease and did not evaluate more modern-day players. Modern-day players are bigger.\nWe rate Goodell\u2019s statement Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08307"}
