This was warned by some politicians since February, when the National Convention authorities ordered new elections after they found fraud in the ninth congressional race. The majority leader of the Senate, Mitch McConnell North Carolina, mentioned in a speech on 26 February when he clashed with human resources 1, a Democrat bill aimed at making voting easier. Maconel criticized the bill for not taking up votes. On March 9, the Republic of Denmark, a Republic of Texas, took this criticism another step. Crenshaw responded to Twitter on Rep. Jo Kennedy, a supporter of the bill, and said that HR1 would legitimize the \"type of fraud\" found in North Carolina. \"You realize that your bill #HR1 will actually make this kind of fraud in #NC09 legal. Yeah? It would have legitimized the collection of votes throughout the country, used your $1 tax to do so, radically limited freedom of expression, \"Crenshaw's tweet. The terms \"vote harvesting\" and \"blot harvesting\" usually refer to political activists who track down and collect absent ballot papers from voters. Many states have strict laws limiting persons who can vote on behalf of absent voters. In those states, the collection of votes is illegal. So is Crenshaw right? Did HR 1 \"legal\" vote-gathering all over the country? A review of the political facts of the bill found dozens of missing ballots - but none of the proposed changes in the law will relieve political actors in North Carolina. What happened at the Republican Party NC Mark Harris seemed to have defeated the Democratic Dan McCreedy by 905 votes. However, in February, an NC Election Board investigation found that political elements had tampered with absentee voices and might have had special access to the results of the vote in the province of Bian. New elections are scheduled for September. In the testimony given during the investigation in North Carolina, political activists acknowledged the following: The law of the State prohibits anyone other than his or her close relative from holding an absent ballot for the voter. \u2022 The votes of the Republicans are filled if absent voters leave some races empty. \u2022 Suspicious signatures of witnesses on post ballot papers. In addition, several absent ballots were requested but never returned. In the end, NC electoral council staff referred to fraud as \"a coordinated, illegal and well-resourced ballot scheme.\" The Council itself, a group of political appointees from both major parties, voted unanimously to reverse the November results. According to HR1 HR1, also known as the People &apos; s Act 2019, absent voters are mentioned dozens of times. But it does not: expand who can collect the absent ballots. Allowing people to fill in the ballot papers for voters. The laws of disappearance of persons who sign or \"witness,\" alibi cards. When a voter fills out an absent ballot, two persons must sign it to verify the voter &apos; s authenticity. Human Resources 1 \"shut up on the question of whether states can have laws that allow people to collect absent ballots from others,\" said Rick Hasen, Professor of Law and Political Science at the University of Irvine. Hansen said that Crenshaw's tweet was \"wrong on some of the charges.\" On January 26, 2021, in the North Carolina tweet, Secretary of State Ellen Marshall, Jenna Woodsworth stated, \"She has won state-wide races more than anyone else is likely to be alive.\" By Paul Specett: 1 February 2021, Justin Levitt, Professor and Assistant Dean of Research at the Loyola School of Law in California, said \"nothing in the human resources I have seen\" would ease the rules for collecting votes or \"let anyone other than voters add votes to the ballot.\" In fact, Rip Mark Walker, a Republican from North Carolina, introduced an amendment that attempted to prohibit the collection of votes. But he failed. The bill refers to absent ballots in the context of improved access to vote. In that section, 305, the bill strengthens the authority of state governments to enact methods to track the delivery of absent ballots. Another section, 307, seeks to ensure the validity of absent ballots and promotes the rights of States to formulate procedures. So what did Crenshaw say? What was Crenshaw referring to? Bolivi Fakt sent an e-mail to his office at around 11 a.m. on Monday. In about 30 minutes, Crenshaw tweeted clarification. \"Clarify: Human resources1 permit the collection of ballot papers by means of compulsory invalid ballots and does not prohibit the practice of collecting ballot papers. Dims rejected our amendment to Human Resources 1, which would make it illegal. It must be illegal to allow fraud as we saw in NC09, \"he tweeted. In response to an e-mail from the Polyte Fact, Crenshaw Kerry Rum referred us to the second tweet and did not provide any other context. Crenshaw's second tweet refers to human resources efforts 1 to allow more people to fill out absent ballots. Some states require voters to have an excuse - illness, disability, etc. Accomplishment for an in absentia ballot. Some states, including North Carolina, do not require voters to have an excuse at all. The distribution of voting laws in each state can be found on the website of the National Congress of State Legislatures. Human resources 1 expand \"no excuse,\" like \"no fault,\" absent vote across the country. But again, Crenshaw's tweet is misleading. Livit said: \"The failure to take further steps to outlaw something at the federal level is far from \"making this type of fraud in NC09 legal.\" What the experts say is that it is fair to claim that allowing more absentee voting may offer potential criminals more opportunities to break the law. However, his second tweet indicates that the ban on the collection of votes could have prevented fraud in North Carolina. That's not true. The collection of ballot papers \"is already illegal in North Carolina, and these laws have not prevented misconduct,\" said Wendy Weather, Director of Democracy Program at the Brennan Center for Justice at the University of New York. What about Crenshaw's claim to finance harvesting efforts from taxpayers? Part VII of the bill calls on the Federal Government to reimburse the states that establish a system for tracking the ballot. \"With regard to the tax dollar, my guess (just a guess) is that it confuses a separate question concerning public funding for elections,\" Hasen said in an e-mail. \"The Republicans attacked public finance on the grounds that they were taking tax dollars to politicians,\" Hasen's followers. \"In the end, human resources 1 was adjusted to use fees from perpetrators to pay for election financing. However, whether it is fair or unfair to call financing financed by taxpayers, this has nothing to do with the so-called \"balot harvest.\" Our RULING Crenshaw human resources 1 would legitimize the \"type of fraud\" found in NC 9. There is no expansion in the draft law for those who can collect absent votes, allow people to fill out ballots for others, or ease the certification procedure for absent votes. Crenshaw then explained his original tweet to say \"no excuse\" for absent votes to be collected. The second tweet also indicated that a ban on the collection of ballot papers would prevent fraud in North Carolina. That's not true. And his arguments do nothing to prove his original tweet. We assess his claim is wrong. This story was produced by the North Carolina Fact Review Project, a partnership from Maclachi Carolina, Duke University Reporter Laboratory and Fact Politics.
