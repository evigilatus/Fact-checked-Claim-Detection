Barack Obama, remarks on Senate floor, April 13, 2005 \u00a0\u00a0\n\"I support the step a majority of senators today took to change the way that Washington is doing business \u2014 more specifically, the way the Senate does business. \u00a0What a majority of senators determined \u2026 is that they would restore the longstanding tradition of considering judicial and public service nominations on a more routine basis.\" \u00a0\nPresident Obama, remarks on Senate efforts to confirm presidential nominees, Nov. 21, 2013\n\u00a0\nAfter years of threats and retreats by both parties, the Democratic Senate majority on Nov. 21, 2013, enacted a controversial rule change called the \"nuclear option.\"\nThe change eliminated the filibuster \u2014 a blockage of floor action, typically by the chamber\u2019s minority party \u2014 for executive branch nominations as well as judicial appointments short of the Supreme Court. Under the new rule, the Senate only needs a 51-vote majority instead of a 60-vote supermajority to end a filibuster and move to a final vote on a nomination.\nThe question of whether to change the rule has long divided the chamber\u2019s majority and its minority. In fact, supporting or opposing the \"nuclear option\" has been much more closely linked to a senator\u2019s position in the majority or the minority than whether they\u2019re a Republican or Democrat.\nThis means that both sides in this recent faceoff made different arguments than they had in previous iterations of the battle.\nFollowing the decision, President Barack Obama gave a press conference lauding and supporting the change, which was implemented with the support of all but a few Democrats and no Republicans. Yet the president had strongly condemned the maneuver during his own time as a senator.

The meter is not intended to pass judgment on whether the change is justified or not. It simply looks at whether they did, indeed, change their stated position.\nWe\u2019ll take a look back to 2005, when the partisan lineup was substantially different. President George W. Bush had recently won a second term, while his fellow Republicans had a majority in the Senate. (The House was also controlled by Republicans, but the House isn\u2019t directly involved in the filibuster fight.)\nIn the Senate, the Democratic minority had filibustered a number of Bush\u2019s judicial appointments, displeasing Republicans, who seriously considered implementing the nuclear option that would allow them to confirm judges with a simple majority.\nThe effort drew the outrage of Democrats, among them then-Sen. Barack Obama, who had won his seat the previous November:\n\"What (the American people) don't expect is for one party, be it Republican or Democrat, to change the rules in the middle of the game so they can make all the decisions while the other party is told to sit down and keep quiet,\" Obama said on the Senate floor in April 2013. He added, \"If the right of free and open debate is taken away from the minority party and the millions of Americans who ask us to be their voice, I fear the partisan atmosphere in Washington will be poisoned to the point where no one will be able to agree on anything.\"\nThe threat to go nuclear was eventually rescinded when a bipartisan group of senators \u2013 the \"Gang of 14\" \u2013 pledged to block the effort. Seven Democrats agreed to no\u00a0longer support their party\u2019s filibusters on judicial nominees, while seven Republicans promised not to vote with their colleagues to invoke the nuclear option.\nFast-forward to 2013. Now, Democrats held the White House and a Senate majority. The Republican minority had been\u00a0stalling nominations and appointments\u00a0by Obama, including\u00a0filibustering the nomination\u00a0of former Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel for secretary of defense. Senate Democrats decided to go nuclear after the Senate GOP made clear that they had no intention of allowing three vacancies on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to be filled.\nAt that point, Senate Democrats took the opposite view they had taken in 2005. Led by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., they successfully invoked the nuclear option in a near-party-line vote, 52-48.\nObama flipped his position as well. In a statement supporting the rule change, he explained that it would bring the \"longstanding tradition of considering judicial and public service nominations on a more routine basis.\" \u00a0\n\"A deliberate and determined effort to obstruct everything, no matter what the merits, just to refight the result of an election is not normal, and for the sake of future generations, we can't let it become normal, \" Obama said.\nOur ruling\nIn 2005, Obama strongly condemned a proposed Senate rule change by the Republican majority. This week, with a Democratic majority, he supported it. We rate this a Full Flop.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08576"}
