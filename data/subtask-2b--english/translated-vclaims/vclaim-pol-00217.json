Many democratic presidential candidates have been defunct on Twitter by criticizing the movement of the administration. On 28 August, one of them - South Pend, Ind, Mayor Pete Butigig - quoted \"the acquisition of funds from Congress authorized to protect persons facing disasters in order to detain asylum-seekers indefinitely is unreasonable. She doesn't deserve the presidency, she doesn't deserve the United States.\" It is unreasonable to obtain funds from Congress authorized to protect persons facing disasters in order to detain asylum-seekers indefinitely. It does not deserve and does not deserve the presidency of the United States. https://t.co/vHJYduZmmj-Bet Buttigig (@Petbuttig) 28 August 2019 on the issue of removing money from disaster relief, Botttegig described what had happened. However, it is outside the rule in what it says about money used \"indefinitely\" to detain asylum-seekers. Where does the money come from? In the face of the influx of immigrants seeking asylum on the United States-Mexico border, including many families from Central America, Tramp has taken a variety of measures aimed at limiting the ability of migrants to enter the United States and stay in the country while awaiting judicial hearings. On July 26, 2019, the Department of Homeland Security announced that it was \"reprogramming\" some of the funds allocated by Congress to the department. All that has been said, the Section has said that it will transfer a total of $271 million to immigration efforts. Some $112 million of this amount is not directly related to the analysis of the Botigig tweet, as it will be taken from the Coast Guard, the Transport Security Department, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency, the accounts of the Department of Homeland Security and several other offices within the Ministry of National Security. However, the remaining $158.4 million will come from the Federal Disaster Management Agency, which is responsible for disaster prevention and recovery. Most of the Union &apos; s reprogrammed funds to the border -- $155 million -- will come from the core budget of the Disaster Relief Fund, which is spent on recovery from natural disasters. The remaining $3.4 million will be transferred from the Disaster Mitigation Fund, which includes grants to allow local jurisdictions prone to natural disasters to undertake infrastructure projects that reduce future disaster risks. It should be noted that a shift in funding will not eliminate the funding available to the Federation in disaster-stricken areas; the Federal Government has an ongoing disaster relief operation. But it can have some effect, depending on the intensity of the storm season. Migrants seeking asylum in the United States line up for a volunteer meal near the international bridge in Matamoros, Mexico, on April 30, 2019. Where's the money going? The Ministry of National Security allocated $271 million for sending to the border for two specific purposes. A sum of $116 million (but only $3.4 million from the Federation accounts) will be used to pay for the family costs of detained adults and to transport them to and from immigration hearings. \"These additional beds are required to manage the crisis on the south-west border and to quickly transport foreigners from overcrowded border patrol stations,\" by the National Security Department. The rest of these funds will be spent on transportation - \"the safe and secure transfer of migrants from border patrols to immigration and customs agency detention facilities\" as well as on the transfer of migrants to hearings with immigration judges. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 January 11, 2012, the second amount of money to be transferred by the administration amounted to $155 million. This would finance the construction of audio facilities under the Migrants Protection Protocol or the Migrants Protection Programme. Under the protocols for the protection of migrants, \"some foreign individuals entering or seeking entry into the United States from Mexico - illegally or without proper documentation - can be returned to Mexico and are waiting outside the United States for the duration of the immigration procedure, where Mexico will provide them with all appropriate human protection throughout their stay.\" The Ministry of National Security stated that this additional workload required a new courtroom infrastructure. \"The current courts have the capacity of infrastructure and security constraints that are exceeded by adding PP cases to the current list of undetained cases,\" the Department wrote. These funding shifts have been criticized. Deputy Lucille Ruibal-Alard, D-Calif, who chairs the Subcommittee on Internal Security of the House of Representatives, said that she \"did not strongly agree\" with the action taken by the Section. \"DHS ignored the agreement negotiated with Congress by exceeding the amount allocated for immigration law enforcement and deportations\" written. Steve Ellis, executive vice president of the public sense taxpayers, said that the shift was \"the theft of Peter to pay Paul.\" \"Many substantial disaster financing was already targeted at past disasters, such as Maria, who had defeated Puerto Rico in 2017.\" The Trump campaign responded that Obama had done something similar during a previous border crisis in 2014 and that the Democrats had been aware of that decision for a month and had decided only to complain about a hurricane approaching \"political points.\" (The Director of the Federal Emergency Management Department of Obama, Craig Voguet, NPR, reported that the section on Obama's use of similar maneuver was accurate. In general, however, Page is right to say that Trump has taken \"the Congress's authorized money to protect people facing disasters\" for other purposes. However, the evaluation of Butigig's description confuses the situation with the second part of his assertion - that the money taken from the Federation will be used \"to detain asylum-seekers indefinitely.\" Butig's idea is not inspired by all the cloth. The Trump Administration has followed the policy of directing immigration judges not to allow the release of migrants on bail after they have established that there is \"a credible fear of persecution or torture\" in the country of origin. The decision of the Trump administration has cancelled a policy that had existed since 2005, and given the backlog, this may result in months or years of detention until their cases are heard. However, a change in the policy of the Trump administration was prevented by a federal judge in Seattle. The legal battle continues. It should also be noted that, given how the Ministry of National Security pays the transferred funds, only a small portion of the funds from the European Women's Union - about 2 per cent - will go towards the housing and transportation of detainees, which could be considered the \"undefined detention\" cited by Butigig. The other 98 percent of the money taken from the Foundation is directed towards building listening facilities for individuals who will be kept in Mexico pending their proceedings. It is difficult to call it money spent on the indefinite detention of migrants. In theory, holding faster hearings would end detention indefinitely, and would not encourage it. \"It is not quite right to say that the funds have been reprogrammed for \"undefined\" detention, \" said Denis L. Gilman, director of the Immigration Clinic and clinical professor at the University of Texas-Osten Law School. A more accurate statement is that \"the $3.4 million reprogramming to fund the detention of asylum-seekers\" is extensive and lengthy.\" The Butigig campaign said that it stood by the candidate's tweet, citing the Administration's opposition to the judge's ruling and its assertion that money was needed to remedy the shortage caused by its own policies. The governor said Trump was taking money from Congress authorized to protect people facing disasters in order to detain asylum seekers indefinitely. But Stigge was right about the financial transition involving taking over $158 million from the FEMA accounts. However, it was somewhat excessive when he said that funds from FEMA would be used \"to detain asylum-seekers indefinitely.\" This policy has been suspended by a federal judge, and all funds withheld from the Federal Department of Immigration, with the exception of a small part, will be used to build new facilities for immigration hearings, not indefinite detention.
