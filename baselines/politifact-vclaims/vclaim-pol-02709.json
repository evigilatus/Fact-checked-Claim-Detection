It also sets up required training and reporting procedures on sexual harassment for state elected officials, lobbyists and employees.\n\nBut another speaker at the same hearing said this action, though laudable, was arriving far too late. In emotional testimony, crime victim advocate Denise Rotheimer delivered detailed allegations of improper behavior toward her by Sen. Ira Silverstein, D-Chicago, as she worked with him to get a bill passed in the legislature.\n\nRotheimer described a circuitous path as she tried to file a complaint about Silverstein\u2019s alleged harassment only to see her case gather dust. Normally, such complaints would go to the Office of Legislative Inspector General, but there has been no legislative inspector general since Dec. 31, 2014. It was the responsibility of the House and Senate to fill the vacancy, but it never got done.\nMadigan, however, said the lack of an inspector general for just shy of three years was no cause for alarm.\n\n\"It\u2019s regrettable that we have not had an inspector general, but I think it\u2019s important to know that the Legislative Ethics Commission continues to function,\" Madigan said. He said the ethics commission\u2019s executive director, Randy Erford, \"has provided for the commission to continue to function\" and had fielded 26 complaints since 2015. Madigan also said the commission is empowered to appoint a temporary inspector general, but had not done so.\nThis made little sense to us. How could the ethics commission \"continue to function\" in any meaningful way if there was no one to investigate complaints of ethical violations brought to it? Isn\u2019t the primary purpose of any ethics commission to investigate and mete out discipline for ethics violations? And if it was functioning, why did Rotheimer\u2019s case languish until she went public with her allegations?\nQuick response\nWe should note up front that no sooner did Madigan conclude his testimony than lawmakers moved swiftly to get an inspector general in place. In a meeting on Saturday, Nov. 4, the eight-member Legislative Ethics Commission voted unanimously to appoint former Assistant U.S. Attorney Julie B. Porter as temporary legislative inspector general through June 30.\nSo Illinois now has someone to receive and investigate ethics complaints against lawmakers. Just three days later, on Nov. 7, the General Assembly passed legislation revising the ethics code that applies to elected officials, state employees and lobbyists to include clear language specifying behavior that qualifies as sexual harassment. It also waived the one-year statute of limitations that would have nullified complaints filed more than a year before Porter\u2019s appointment.\nA day after Rotheimer\u2019s testimony, Silverstein stepped down from his Majority Caucus Chair leadership post -- which added $20,649 to Silverstein\u2019s annual base pay of $67,836 -- as Cullerton prepared to remove him.\nBut none of this erases the nearly three-year void in which no one was assigned to field and investigate ethics complaints against lawmakers.\nStandard procedure\nAs described on the Legislative Ethics Commission\u2019s website and in Illinois statutes, the duties of the commission rely heavily on the presence of a Legislative Inspector General. This includes conducting administrative hearings and making rulings \"only upon the receipt of pleadings filed by the Legislative Inspector General and not upon its own prerogative\u2026 Any other allegations of misconduct received by the Commission from a person other than the Legislative Inspector General shall be referred to the Office of the Legislative Inspector General.\"\nMadigan said the commission had continued to receive reports -- 26 of them, though published reports said there were 27 -- even when there was no inspector general. But the law makes clear that those allegations were to be referred to the inspector general. Further, the law says the commission can act on cases only after they have gone through the inspector general.\nOther duties listed on the commission\u2019s site pertain to administrative functions like publishing manuals and guides, submitting reports, employee training and preparing public information materials on ethics compliance. By law, the commission is required to meet monthly or \"as often as necessary.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi bought $1.25 million in Tesla stock the day before Joe Biden signed an order \u201cfor all federal vehicles\u201d to be electric.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThose would not be impeded by lack of an inspector general.\nLong-term vacancy\nThe office of Legislative Inspector General had been vacant since Jan 1, 2015. Though Illinois law says the legislative inspector general is to be appointed by \"joint resolution of the Senate and the House,\" lawmakers never filled the vacancy.\nRepublicans had accused Madigan, generally regarded as the most powerful politician in Springfield, if not the entire state, of sandbagging the appointment. Illinois News Network quoted ethics commission member Rep. Chad Hays, R-Catlin, voicing that complaint:\nOn his Facebook page, Hays said he and another ethics commissioner, Rep. Norine Hammond, pressed for the inspector general position to be filled.\n\n\"My read on the matter is that the Speaker has thwarted efforts to finalize this dynamic,\" Hays said. \"No rationale for foot dragging on this matter is acceptable. The length of time that the position has remained unoccupied is absurd.\"\nMadigan spokesman Steve Brown called allegations that Madigan impeded a permanent replacement \"baseless.\"\nSenate President John Cullerton on Nov. 1 said in a press release that three candidates for the job had turned it down in the past year:\n\"It\u2019s our duty to fill that post. I take responsibility for my role in that lapse, and I apologize for it,\" Cullerton said. \"These corrective actions are a first step in changing an unacceptable culture that has existed for too long.\"\nOur ruling\nMadigan said the Illinois Legislative Ethics Commission continued to function for nearly three years while the Office of Legislative Inspector General was vacant.\nTo the extent that the eight-member commission continued to schedule monthly meetings and\u00a0saw to internal matters, it did \"continue to function.\" This included its executive director receiving numerous reports of alleged ethics violations.\nBut without an inspector general, it could not function in its capacity to take substantive action on alleged ethics violations. This is why Denise Rotheimer\u2019s complaint saw no action until she went public with her allegations in a House committee hearing.\nThere\u2019s an element of truth in Madigan\u2019s statement but there\u2019s a lot more that\u2019s missing.
