Glenn Grothman criticizes Barack Obama over vetting of Syrian refugees", "text": "With questions about border security and refugees from Syria still dominating the debate in the Republican presidential contest, we decided to look back in our files and tackle a claim made in late 2015 by U.S. Rep. Glenn Grothman of Wisconsin\nOn Nov. 20, 2015, soon after the House passed a bill that would increase security checks on refugees from Iraq and Syria, Grothman appeared on conservative talker Jay Weber\u2019s show on WISN (1130-AM). In the appearance, he asserted President Barack Obama has basically an open-door policy when it comes to immigrants.\n\"Whether it\u2019s dealing with the Middle East or south of the border, Barack Obama is apparently not for vetting people and saying just anybody can come here and we\u2019ll see what happens,\" said Grothman, R-Campbellsport. \u00a0\nSince Grothman made his statement in the context of the Syrian refugee bill, we\u2019ll evaluate the claim with that in mind. Obama plans to accept about 10,000 people from Syria in 2016.\nRefugee process\nObama has said Syrian refugees coming into United States must follow the same vetting process as all other refugees. But Republicans argue that is not enough and more stringent background checks are necessary, given concerns about terrorists posing as refugees and slipping into the country.\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at the vetting process for those seeking refuge in the United States.\nThose seeking refuge must find a United Nations Refugee Agency and identify themselves as a refugee. The U.N. collects data on the applicant, such as their date and place of birth. Applicants are interviewed to confirm need for resettlement.\nRefugees from active war zones, including Syria, already must undergo additional checks, such as iris scans that are checked against terrorist databases.\nThe White House says less than 1 percent of the global refugee population is considered strong candidates to be admitted to the United States and make it past this first check.\nThen, applicants are received by a federally funded Resettlement Support Center overseas.\nAn applicant file is created with identifying documents and security checks conducted. Candidates are screened by at least four U.S. security agencies -- National Counterterrorism Center, the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department. The agencies check for security risks, such as ties to known bad actors, and criminal history.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin LeMahieu\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a TV interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It takes quite a while on Election Day to load those ballots, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe process continues with a Homeland Security interview; those from Syria get an \"enhanced review,\" which means their documents are scrutinized more closely. Fingerprints are taken and screened against federal databases. A medical screening occurs. Cultural orientation classes are taken. Travel is booked. Finally, the refugees arrives in the United States. \u00a0\nU.S. officials will eliminate any candidate who intelligence does not think will make a good candidate to enter the United States.\n\"Any doubt, they\u2019re out,\" said Melanie Nezer, vice president of policy and advocacy for the refugee assistance group HIAS.\nGrothman\u2019s backup\nGrothman\u2019s team sent a series of links to news articles and quotes from federal officials as evidence of Obama\u2019s stance on refugees.\n\"The idea that somehow they pose a more significant threat than all the tourists who pour into the United States every single day just doesn\u2019t jive with reality,\" Obama said in his remarks after a meeting with the Canadian prime minister Nov. 19, 2015.\nGrothman also included a quote from FBI Director James Comey\u2019s congressional testimony in October 2015.\n\"If we don\u2019t know much about somebody, there won\u2019t be anything in our data,\" Comey said. \"I can\u2019t sit here and offer anybody an absolute assurance that there\u2019s no risk associated with this.\"\nBut Comey didn\u2019t say the system is failing, or that no vetting occurs. Only that it is impossible to identify every potential problem.\n\"James Comey doesn\u2019t have the power of absolute foresight,\" said Antonio Ginatta, advocacy director of Human Rights Watch. \"No level of vetting would get you to 100 percent.\"\nOur rating\nGrothman said, \"Barack Obama is apparently not for vetting people and saying just anybody can come\" to the United States.\nBut refugees are the most vetted people who enter the country -- and Syrian refugees already \u00a0face additional measures. What\u2019s more, Grothman\u2019s evidence didn\u2019t back up his claim.\nWe rate the claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05360"}
