More than half of all people who filed federal taxes two years ago did not pay a penny? Really? This is the kind of question PolitiFact Oregon loves most, a hard number attached to a specific claim. Let\u2019s take a look.\n\nWe start with the Joint Committee on Taxation, a respected and decidedly wonkish bipartisan committee of Congress. The committee found that for tax year 2009, roughly 22 percent of \"tax units\" (not exactly \"households,\" but we\u2019ll give Cornilles a pass on the terminology) ended up without any tax liability. Another 30 percent got all their tax money back from the government, through mechanisms such as the Earned Income Tax Credit, a longstanding policy that encourages low-income Americans to work by refunding money through the tax code. By contrast, the committee found just 49 percent of Americans owed anything to the government.\n\nPut another way, 51 percent of taxpayers in 2009 had zero liability, according to the committee\u2019s research.\n\nLater studies reached a similar conclusion. A July 11 report issued by the Tax Policy Center, which is a joint effort by the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution, concluded that \"about 46 percent of American households will pay no federal individual income tax in 2011.\"\n\nBob Williams, a tax policy specialist at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, said this is largely carried out through popular tax breaks, which are sometimes called \"tax expenditures.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\"There are lots and lots of them,\" he said. \"We estimate they total more than a trillion dollars a year in reduced taxes, and in fact the bulk of those go to the top end of the income distribution.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\nHowever, because high earners have so much income liability, the breaks they get still don\u2019t lower their taxes to zero. By contrast, popular lower- and middle-income breaks such as child credits and mortgage interest deductions do get a big share of the population off the hook. \u00a0\n\nTax demographics are a lot like the weather; it changes year to year though the general framework holds - August is hot and January is cold. In this case, a substantial percentage of Americans pay no taxes each year even though the percentage bounces up and down over time.\n\nFigures from the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center show that since 2004, the percentage of no-liability tax units has been as low as 39.9 percent in 2007. In fact, 2009 -- the year Cornilles cites on his webpage -- may prove to be a high point. The center\u2019s projections suggest that the rate could fall to 49.5 percent for tax year 2010 and 46.4 percent in 2011.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt, then, that the 51 percent figure Cornilles cites holds up. The Joint Commission on Taxation and the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center have strong reputations. But when we asked, Cornilles\u2019 campaign said he relied on another source as his primary defense - a national PolitiFact item written in July that examined Texas Sen. John Cornyn\u2019s assertion of the same claim. Good source, we think.\n\nJust as Cornyn did from the Senate floor last summer, Cornilles was clear and precise that his reference to 51 percent not paying taxes relates to 2009. The claim held up then and it does now. We rate his claim: True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the 2017 tax law, \u201cpeople who make under $75,000 will have their taxes raised in 2021 and every 2 years after that until 2027.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you think?
