Why isn\u2019t this National News?\" said Peggy Hubbard, who ran for U.S. Senate and lost Illinois\u2019 Republican primary election in March.\nHubbard\u2019s post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our\u00a0partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nHubbard\u2019s claim is based on a triple homicide that happened Sept. 18 on the patio of Bungalow Joe\u2019s bar and restaurant in Louisville. Michael E. Rhynes Jr. was charged with three counts of murder and has pleaded not guilty.\nA photo shows and police confirmed that Rhynes was wearing a different shirt, not a Breonna Taylor shirt.\u00a0\nTaylor was a 25-year-old Black woman who was shot and killed by Louisville police in March as officers executed a search warrant at her home. Since her death, activists, athletes and celebrities have called attention to the case, and her name has become a rallying cry in nationwide calls for police reform.\u00a0\nBut her name was not on the shirt Rhynes was wearing at the time of the bar shooting. In a still photo taken from a TikTok video showing his arrest shortly after the shooting, Rhynes\u2019 shirt is visible. It features images of Muhammad Ali and Colin Kaepernick and the hashtag #freedom, according to Snopes.com.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe shirt Rhynes wore was custom made by a company Rhynes co-owns, according to Louisville police. Rhynes\u2019 LinkedIn profile says he is the chief executive officer for Serve N Slay Images in Louisville, and the Kentucky Secretary of State lists him as the registered agent for the company.\u00a0\nServe N Slay\u2019s apparel line is \"geared towards showing a positive image and message for the black community with a bit of attitude and flavor,\" according to its website. The clothing offered for sale includes a Black Lives Matter t-shirt.\nThere is no online evidence to indicate that Rhynes is an activist within the Black Lives Matter movement. Facebook, Instagram and Twitter accounts for his business have been disabled or removed. Rhynes also does not appear to have any currently active personal social media accounts.\nLouisville Metro Police Department Lt. Donny Burbrink, who leads the department\u2019s homicide unit, said the shooting seemed to be \"a completely random act.\" Police said they do not have any proof that the crime was racially motivated, WAVE 3 News in Louisville reported, and one of the men killed was a Black man.\u00a0\nOther social media posts similar to Hubbard\u2019s falsely claimed that the bar where the triple shooting took place is owned by a retired police officer. The owner of Bungalow Joe\u2019s, Joe Bishop, has debunked that rumor himself in media interviews. Bishop also told Fox News that his review of security footage revealed Rhynes was not wearing a Breonna Taylor shirt\nOur ruling\nHubbard said,\u00a0\"BLM Activist kills three people in a Louisville bar wearing a Breonna Taylor tee shirt last Friday. Why isn\u2019t this National News?\"\nHubbard\u2019s Facebook post contains an element of truth because a triple homicide did take place in Louisville and the alleged shooter owns a business that promotes positive messages for the Black community, including on clothing it sells. However, the post ignores critical facts: The shooter is not known to be an activist in the Black Lives Matter movement and was not wearing a shirt featuring Breonna Taylor.
