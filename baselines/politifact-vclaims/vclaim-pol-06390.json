During Reagan's presidency, black unemployment dropped 20 percent.\" This text has been placed over a photograph of an African-American man wearing a T-shirt that reads, \"I need a job.\"\nIs the meme correct? We took a closer look.\nWe\u2019ll start by noting that on its face, the comparison is odd. It compares Reagan\u2019s full eight-year term to five years under Obama (not even the full six-plus years that Obama has been in office so far). Doing so is problematic because it\u2019s not an apples-to-apples comparison. In addition, the meme glosses over the question of how much impact a president has on unemployment among any racial or ethnic group. Their policies are generally considered to have some impact, but joblessness is also affected by factors beyond a president\u2019s control, such as technological change and international economic competition.\nThat said, the meme also has problems with the data. We\u2019ll start by looking at the parameters the meme used, even though they are of questionable value.\nDuring Reagan\u2019s full term -- January 1981 to January 1989 -- black unemployment fell from 14.6 percent to 11.8 percent. That\u2019s a decline of 2.8 percentage points, or 19 percent. That\u2019s close to what the meme said.\nBut during Obama\u2019s first five years -- January 2009 to January 2014 -- black unemployment didn\u2019t rise at all, which is what the meme said. Rather, it fell from 12.7 percent to 12.1 -- a decline of 0.6 percentage points, or about 5 percent. The meme\u2019s claim of a 42 percent increase is way off.\nNow let\u2019s look at the first five years of each presidency -- a more reasonable comparison to make.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring Reagan\u2019s first five years -- January 1981 to January 1986 -- black unemployment fell from 14.6 percent to 14.5 percent. That\u2019s a decline of 0.1 percentage point, or less than a 1 percent decrease. This is a lot less impressive than the meme\u2019s favored eight-year decline of 20 percent. It\u2019s also less impressive than the 5 percent decline during Obama\u2019s first five years.\nIf we instead look at Obama\u2019s entire term to date -- January 2009 to April 2015 -- black unemployment fell from 12.7 percent to 9.6 percent. That\u2019s down 3.1 percentage points, or a decrease of 24 percent. That\u2019s a more impressive decline than under Reagan\u2019s entire term.\nThere are also other ways to compare the two presidents\u2019 records on black unemployment.\n\u2022 The black unemployment rate peaked at 21.2 percent under Reagan in January 1983, but the peak under Obama was significantly lower -- 16.8 percent in March 2010.\n\u2022 The low point for black unemployment under Reagan was 11\u00a0percent, reached twice in 1988. The low point under Obama is 9.6 percent, which is the current rate. That\u2019s lower than the lowest point under Reagan.\n\u2022 Under Reagan, black unemployment exceeded its worst level under Obama -- 16.8 percent -- for 26 consecutive months, or more than two years straight.\nOur ruling\nThe meme says that \"during Obama's first five years as president, black unemployment increased 42 percent. During Reagan's presidency, black unemployment dropped 20 percent.\"\nThis claim is problematic on several levels. It presents a time frame cherry-picked to boost Reagan\u2019s record. It flat-out misrepresents the statistics during Obama\u2019s first five years, when black unemployment actually fell. And it ignores several other measures that show that black unemployment was better in absolute terms under Obama than Reagan. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06390"}
