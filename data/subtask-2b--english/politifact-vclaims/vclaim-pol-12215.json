He's trying to start a business. So I can empathize.\"\n\nWas America\u2019s potential \"first son\" forced out by a federal reg?\n\nThe CNN post says Griffin Perry worked for Deutsche Bank, which is a global investment bank that offers investment, financial and related products and services to private individuals, corporate entities and institutional clients. CNN\u2019s story also says it was unclear what SEC regulations Anita Perry was referring to, but the \"commission adopted a new rule last year aimed at limiting political activity on the part of investment advisers.\"\n\nThat rule was described at the time as intended to stop employees of firms that advise government agencies on investing public funds from getting unfair edges on such contracts by making contributions to candidates with possible sway over who gets hired to give the advice.\n\nAccording to an SEC press release, the commission unanimously adopted the rule June 30, 2010, or about 18 months into Democrat Barack Obama\u2019s presidency. At the time, SEC spokesman John Nester told us, the commission consisted of an Obama appointee and four appointees of his Republican predecessor, George W. Bush.\n\nThe commission had proposed a similar regulation in 1999, according to a June 30, 2010 New York Times news article. \"Since then,\" the article says, \"the SEC has brought enforcement actions against investment advisers in pay-to-play schemes involving public pension funds in states including California, Illinois, Ohio and Florida.\"\n\nThe adopted rule doesn\u2019t bar investment advisers from helping a candidate or even making huge campaign donations. However, an investment adviser risks being barred from getting paid for advising a government client for two years if any of certain employees make more than a minimal contribution--at most $350 per candidate per election--to a candidate or officeholder who could influence which firms get hired to advise agencies on investments.\n\nAlso, the rule bars certain employees of such firms from soliciting contributions from others for a candidate or political committee, a practice known as bundling, if they also are providing or seeking government business.\n\nNester told us the rule applies to senior staff members at investment advisory firms and employees who solicit business.\n\nNext, we wondered how the rule made Griffin Perry quit.\n\nAccording to information on the \"Broker Check\" website, overseen by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Perry was a registered broker for Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. in Dallas from May 2008 through Oct. 11, 2011. Information on an SEC website says he also was an investment adviser representative.\n\nWe failed to pin down his duties, though. Deutsche Bank spokeswoman Sigalit Grego had no comment. Perry\u2019s campaign did not respond to our request to interview Griffin Perry.\n\nDeutsche Bank provides services for several Texas state agencies overseeing investment funds.\n\nManagers of the Permanent School Fund, the state\u2019s public education endowment, use the firm as a broker, according to the Texas Education Agency. The Employees Retirement System of Texas told us the firm provides securities lending services, which is a way for investors to generate more money from stock without selling it. And Howard Goldman, spokesman for the Teacher Retirement System of Texas, said Deutsche Bank is among 40 brokerage firms that assist that system by executing trades for stock and other investment vehicles.\n\nInquiring into why Perry had to quit due to the rule, we heard from a Perry campaign spokesman, Ray Sullivan, that the son\u2019s \"contribution of time and effort, and likely participation in campaign fundraising (e.g., speaking at fundraising events), would have likely triggered the new rule and resulting sanctions.\"\n\nBy email, Sullivan said the rule severely restricts employees such as investment advisers \"from participating in the campaigns of incumbent state and local officials like Gov. Perry.\"\n\n\"Griffin Perry was a financial adviser and is now understandably involved in his father's presidential campaign activities,\" Sullivan said. \"Therefore he could not continue to be employed by the bank without jeopardizing a new SEC rules violation, which would have banned his employer from certain business in the state of Texas.\"\n\nSullivan shared an article by Scott Gluck, a specialist in securities law, in the Oct. 6, 2011, Hedge Fund Law Report, saying the rule \"applies to virtually all domestic fund managers seeking to manage money on behalf of public pension funds.\"\n\nThe article says too that pitching in for a state official running for president can be problematic, specifying that \u00a0contributions to \"presidential candidate Gov. Rick Perry ... might trigger the rule.\"\n\nAn SEC discussion of the rule when it was approved says the donation limit applies to donations to state officials seeking federal office \"not because of the office he or she is running for, but as a result of an office he or she currently holds. So long as a (state or local) official has influence over the hiring of investment advisers as a function of his or her current office, contributions by an adviser could have the same effect, regardless to which of the official\u2019s campaigns the adviser contributes.\"\n\nAs much as donations are restricted, we noticed that the rule still permits someone at an investment firm to personally volunteer for a candidate. The SEC\u2019s summary says: \"A covered associate\u2019s donation of his or her time generally would not be viewed as a contribution\" in possible violation of the rule \"if such volunteering were to occur during non-work hours.\"\n\nThe summary also says the rule \"does not in any way impinge on a wide range of expressive conduct in connection with elections. For example, the rule imposes no restrictions on activities such as making independent expenditures to express support for candidates, volunteering, making speeches, and other conduct.\"\n\nSullivan, reminded of this element, replied: \"Griffin will be involved in every part of the campaign, including raising the funds and volunteers we need.\" Pressed again, Sullivan asked: \"Does the rule \u2013 in your view \u2013 allow Griffin to attend a luncheon fundraiser for or with his Dad? \u00a0What are \u2018non-work hours?\u2019\"\n\nWe\u2019re left not knowing the answers to several questions about the rule and Griffin Perry: \u00a0Did his duties involve soliciting clients? Was he intent on bundling donations or contributing more than the rule\u2019s permitted amount to the Perry campaign? Also, does Rick Perry\u2019s position enable him to influence the hiring of particular outside advisers by state agencies managing public funds? If not, the rule would not be a factor.\n\nWe\u2019re left not knowing the answers to several questions about the rule and Griffin Perry:\u00a0 Did his duties involve soliciting clients? Was he intent on bundling donations or contributing more than the rule\u2019s permitted amount to the Perry campaign? Also, does Rick Perry\u2019s position enable him to influence the hiring of particular outside advisers by state agencies managing public funds? If not, the rule would not be a factor.\n\nAmong experts on the regulation, Washington lawyer Ian Lanoff, former fiduciary counsel to the Teachers Retirement System of Texas, reminded us Perry might have pitched in for the campaign and kept his job because the rule \"permits an employee of a state pension fund investment adviser to perform political volunteer work as long as his firm doesn't subsidize the volunteer work he performs.\"\n\nTerry Nelson, a Wisconsin lawyer versed in securities issues, said: \"A large organization like that, they\u2019re probably going to cut ties to people who bring them issues that hamper the business they can conduct in a big state like Texas, no matter what your name is.\"\n\nIndeed, Sullivan later emailed us that a lawyer for Deutsche Bank closely reviewed the SEC rule and \"determined that Griffin could not work on his Dad's presidential campaign and remain employed at the bank. The risk of SEC penalties against the bank were too real and significant. The bank and (Perry) determined that his resignation was the best course of action to provide him the ability to be involved in every aspect of the presidential campaign and not run afoul\" of the rule.\n\nOur ruling\n\nGiven the unknowns, it\u2019s tempting to say we can\u2019t judge Anita Perry\u2019s claim. It\u2019s possible Griffin Perry could have volunteered for the campaign and kept his job. But we think it\u2019s more reasonable to conclude that the SEC rule hastened his departure.\n\nWe rate the claim Mostly True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 23, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBiden invested the entire family fortune in Ukraine gas and oil.
