It says the toll for 2020, as of Nov. 16, is \"2,487,350.\" Some versions also include a whole-year projection of 2,818,527.\n\"People died before Covid. Amazingly the death rate hasn\u2019t changed. How can that be with such a deadly virus????\" one user wrote.\n\n\u00a0\nBut the comparison is flawed for a few\u00a0reasons. The 2020 statistics cited are not the final figures, and\u00a0the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0has\u00a0estimated that\u00a0hundreds of thousands of excess American deaths are attributed to the virus this year. Lastly, it\u00a0ignores that COVID-19 has killed over 290,000 Americans to-date, the highest virus death toll in the world.\u00a0\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nThe numbers listed from 2015 through 2018 are legitimate and come from the CDC. The health agency reported 2,712,630 deaths in the U.S. in 2015, 2,744,248 in 2016, 2,813,503 in 2017, and 2,839,205 in 2018.\nWhile the final numbers for 2019 have not been released, the CDC\u2019s provisional count for the year \u2014 2,855,000 \u2014 comes close to the chart\u2019s 2,900,689 figure, though it\u2019s not clear how they reached the number.\nThe chart\u2019s 2,487,350 figure leading up to the week of Nov. 16, 2020, reflects CDC data, but it\u2019s not a complete depiction of how many Americans died in 2020.\u00a0\nNot only does the figure not account for the final six weeks of the year, it doesn\u2019t represent the first few weeks, either. The weekly provisional deaths table doesn\u2019t begin until the week ending Feb. 1, 2020. What\u2019s more, these numbers are continuously updated due to reporting lags, which the CDC says can range from one week to eight weeks or more, depending on the jurisdiction and cause of death.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMasks have negative impacts on 68% of children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jon Greenberg \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe provisional tally for the year, as of Dec. 11, has already gone up to 2,728,104.\u00a0\nMeanwhile, in another report, the CDC estimated that COVID-19 has caused almost 200,000 excess deaths in the U.S. from late January through early October. Excess deaths are defined in the report as the number of persons who have died from all causes, in excess of the expected number of deaths for a given place and time.\u00a0\n\"Overall, an estimated 299,028 excess deaths occurred from late January through October 3, 2020, with 198,081 (66%) excess deaths attributed to COVID-19,\" the agency reported.\nLauren Rossen, a data scientist with CDC\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics, told PolitiFact that the numbers of deaths in 2020 are \"without a question NOT on par with previous years\" and that claims that the numbers are equivalent are based on misinterpretations and misuse of the available data.\nSince we don\u2019t have all the data for 2020, Rossen said a more accurate analysis would need to involve comparing the number of deaths that occurred in the first 44 weeks, or so, of the year with the number of deaths that occurred over those same weeks in previous years.\u00a0\n\"Looking at the number of deaths each year through week 44 (the most recent weeks are incomplete in 2020 due to the length of time it takes to receive and tabulate death certificates), we can see the totals over the same time periods each year. There have been nearly 317,000 more deaths in 2020 than in the same time period of 2019,\" Rossen said.\nOur ruling\nA chart circulating online claims to demonstrate that the annual U.S. death toll has not changed significantly in 2020 amid COVID-19.\u00a0\nThis is wrong and ignores that the virus has killed more than 290,000 Americans to-date, the most in any country in the world.\u00a0\nThe data used for 2019 is not final and the figures presented for 2020 are incomplete. Other CDC data also refutes the claim\u2019s premise, with an estimation of hundreds of thousands of excess American deaths attributed to the virus this year.\nFalse.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17270"}
