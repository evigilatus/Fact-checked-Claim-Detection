But two days before his address to the nation, Facebook on the President &apos; s remarks on migration began to gain momentum. \"Trump said illegal immigration was a problem in America for \"thousands of years,\" says the January 6, 2018 article. \"Can you be more ignorant?\" By January 18, this information was provided about 15,000 times, and was referred to as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misleading information in NewsWeb. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The account that submitted the claim immediately did not respond to a letter seeking further information. The White House also did not respond to an e-mail about Facebook mail. On January 12, 2021, he wrote in an Instagram article saying that Joe Biden remained silent about the violence in Black Lives-Mite protests. By Tom Kircher: January 16, 2021, but the prosecution appeared on Facebook the same day that Trump received questions from the South Lawn media at the White House about the closure of the government. According to a copy of his remarks, Trump said: \"This morning I offered a quote from Barack Obama; this morning I quote Hillary Clinton in 2015 - a few years ago - saying strongly that you need limits to keep illegals out of the border. That's what you should get. But it's not just illegal. They're criminals. It's drugs. They are new phenomena that have lived for thousands of years, but they have never been worse because of the Internet. Human trafficking - where women are caught and taped to their mouths, come across our borders and sell them. They go both ways.\" About a week later, on January 11, Trump spoke again at the U.S. Border Patrol Center in Macallan, Texas. According to a copy of those remarks, Trump made a similar observation: \"In a few moments, the American people will hear directly from or from front-line agents about the massive flood of illegal migration, drug trafficking and human trafficking - a phenomenon that has been going on for thousands of years or more, which you believe will not be acquired by modern society. And I hate to tell you that because of the Internet, it's worse than ever. Trafficking in human beings - it's terrible.\" Although Trump said \"thousands of years\" - or, later, \"a thousand years or more\" - as he was talking about border security, While the Trump method of expressing awareness sometimes leaves room for interpretation, the actual texts show that it did not indicate that the United States itself was thousands of years old, or that illegal migration had been a problem here for a long time.
