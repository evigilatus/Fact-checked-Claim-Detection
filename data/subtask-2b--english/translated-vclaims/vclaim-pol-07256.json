Some are coming to defend Obama. We can summarize the incident in three short clippings. (Don't worry, there's a fact check coming.) First, this video of the incident, released on the White House page Instagram: Here's part of the reaction, this is from Fox News, and former President George W. Bush's consultant, Carl Ruff. \"Look, he knows there's gonna be two Marines at the bottom of one Marine when he comes down, and the idea that I'm just going to hang out there with my tea, give them my old... you know it's not a latte greeting, it's a tea greeting, because he drinks tea, but I mean, please, how was the disrespect?\" Ruff asked. Finally, we found this Obama defense on the website, Taskantest.com. \"There is no system that states that the President must salute the troops. In fact, this has not happened in the first 192 years of our Republic. None of the first 38 commanders did it. In support of this, Jones quoted the 2012 book Drift prepared by MSNBC. Madhu says the greeting was something Ronald Reagan started. \"The soldiers were supposed to salute their president; the president was not supposed to salute the soldiers. No modern president, not even General Eisenhower, greeted the military. It might even be, well, kind of inappropriate.\" (The passage begins on page 36.) We would not normally have looked for a claim that he was a few years old, but the current surprise with the presidential greeting and the Jones site made us wonder about Madhu's claim that \"even General Eisenhower did not revive the military personnel.\" YouTube and the archive video prove this allegation to be false. As President-elect, Eisenhower visited Korea during the Korean War. In this video, Eisenhower clearly salutes American and United Nations forces. Greetings about two minutes, 30 seconds in. If you need proof of Eisenhower's salute to the troops after taking over the head of the office and in civilian clothes, he did so in November 10, 1954, while attending the United States Navy War Memorial. The images of dedication clearly show Eisenhower salutes military personnel, first when he gets out of the car and then walks on the Marines. Or here's a passage from 1953, where Eisenhower gives a medal of honor to Korean War soldiers. Yahia at 1:15 p.m. and again at 2:57 p.m. He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. By Bill McCarthy: January 12, 2021 this 1959 video shows Eisenhower applauds what appears to be Italian troops, about 40 seconds in, and again in about one minute, 15 seconds. So it's clear that Eisenhower greeted the army as president, contrary to Madhu's claim. We doubt that Madhu's basis for its description may be rooted in the 2007 New York Times opinion article by Gary Wells, an honorary professor of history at Northwestern University, as well as an opinion article in 2004 by the then Reagan military assistant, and now Minnesota, United States Republic, John Klein. When they came up and out of Marines 1, Wales was writing about the president, who greeted the soldiers (just like Obama on Tuesday). \"We remember, for example, the expanded commander in the President's position every time a modern president comes out of the White House helicopter and greets the Marines. \"This is the innovation that Ronald Reagan started. Dwight Eisenhower, a real general, knew that greeting to the uniform, and as a president wasn't wearing one. The exchange of greetings was out of order.\" We were not able to find a copy of Klein's article, which worked in a hill, but the 2008 Reuters novel of Reagan's op-ed describes a greeting case with General Robert Barrow, who was the commander of the Navy. Reagan explained this in a 1986 speech to serve their family members. \"I can't resist telling you a little story I just told the Marine Guard at the embassy.\" The story has something to do with the greeting. I was second lieutenant of the Musketeers in the days of World War II. As I told the Admiral, I ended up flying an army air force office. And so, I know all the rules about not greeting in civilian clothes and so on, and when they should or shouldn't. But then when I got this job -- (Laughter) -- and I was close to Air Force One or Navy One and those Marines came to greet me -- knowing that I'm in civilian clothes -- I'd nod and say \"hello\" and I think they could drop their hands, and they wouldn't. They just stood there. So, one night at the commander's headquarters, the Navy headquarters in Washington, I was getting a couple of high balls, and I didn't -- (Laughter) -- I know what to do with them. So, I told the captain -- I said, \"Look, I know all the rules about greeting in civilian clothes and everything, but if you're the general leader, there must be a list that allows me to say hello. I heard some words of wisdom. He said, \"I think if you do, no one will say anything.\" \"So, if you see me on TV and I salute, you know I have the authority for that now -- (Laughter) -- and I do it happily.\" For the record, the Army Regulations simply state that soldiers are not required to salute when wearing civilian clothes. What are we gonna do with all this? It seems that Reagan was the first president to salute the President, especially when he went out or went up to the Air Force or the Navy. However, Eisenhower returned to salute the military members while he was president, including when he was wearing civilian uniforms. In an e-mail response to Bondet Fuckett, Madhu said that Reagan had begun his presidential greeting as a regular daily series. \"He has begun -- other presidents have continued the practice ever since,\" said Madhu. \"That's the truth. \"I knew the truth wasn't the same as he said that any president ever paid tribute, sometimes, before,\" she said. Our rule (Madu) wrote \"Even General Eisenhower says hello to the military personnel\" as President. For information, the President is not required to greet military personnel. The presidential greeting did not become common until Reagan became president. But Eisenhower, the five-star US Army general, greeted the \"military personnel\" as president, at least occasionally. We searched the archival videos for about 90 minutes and found video evidence for seven greetings. Does that mean he's been doing it the whole time? No. Reagan may have done routine training, but Eisenhower paid tribute to the military. We're assessing Madhu's claim mostly wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07256"}
