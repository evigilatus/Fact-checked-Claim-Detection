The first, which the post says is from 1977, shows a penguin in snow and the headline: \"How To Survive The Coming Ice Age.\" The second, which the post says is from 2008, is an illustration that shows the men from the iconic Iwo Jima photograph lifting a Redwood tree instead of the American flag in the original image from 1945. The cover story from that issue? \"How to Win The War on Global Warming.\"\nThis post, which had been shared more than 8,400 times by May 22, was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

That\u2019s some pretty good photoshopping.\"\nWalsh notes that Time did, in 1974, run a story about the possibility of another Ice Age.\n\"The reality is that scientists in the 1970s were just beginning to understand how climate change and aerosol pollution might impact global temperature,\" Walsh says. \"Add in the media-hype cycle \u2014 which was true then as it is now \u2014 and you have some coverage that turned out wrong. But thanks to the Internet, those stories stay undead, recycled by notorious climate skeptics like George Will. Pay no attention to Photoshop.
