It\u2019s called nuclear. Twenty percent. They could have never done it without her.\"\nThat's a more narrow, and less inflammatory, version of an attack that Trump made previously.\nBut it still has problems.\nThe uranium deal\nBefore we get too far ahead of ourselves -- the United States gave a fifth of its uranium to Russia? What?\nUranium is used to power commercial nuclear reactors that produce electricity and to produce isotopes used for medical, industrial and defense purposes around the world.\nAs for the transaction Trump alluded to, it involved the Russian nuclear agency and Uranium One, a Toronto-based company.\nAs PolitiFact National has reported, Russia\u2019s nuclear energy agency, which also builds nuclear weapons, bought a controlling stake in Uranium One. The company has mines, mills and tracts of land in Wyoming, Utah and other U.S. states equal to about 20 percent of U.S. uranium production capacity.\nSo, to be clear, the 20 percent is capacity, not uranium that has been produced.\nGiven that Russia doesn\u2019t have the licenses to export uranium outside the United States, it was likely more interested in Uranium One\u2019s assets in Kazakhstan, the world\u2019s largest uranium producer, our colleagues said.\nAs the New York Times has reported, the deal was made in separate transactions from 2009 to 2013. It made Russia\u2019s atomic energy agency one of the world\u2019s largest uranium producers and brought Russian President Vladimir Putin \"closer to his goal of controlling much of the global uranium supply chain.\"\nU.S. involvement\nSo, what was Clinton\u2019s role?\nSince uranium is considered a strategic asset, with implications for national security, the deal had to be approved by a committee composed of representatives from a number of United States government agencies.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the time, the United States was seeking to \"reset\" its relationship with Russia and trying to get the Kremlin on board with its Iran nuclear deal.\nThe national security issue at stake in the Uranium One deal was not primarily about nuclear weapons proliferation, the Times reported, because the United States and Russia had for years cooperated on that front, with Russia sending enriched fuel from decommissioned warheads to be used in American nuclear power plants in return for raw uranium.\nInstead, it concerned American dependence on foreign uranium sources. While the United States gets one-fifth of its electrical power from nuclear plants, it produces only around 20 percent of the uranium it needs.\nTrump\u2019s claims\nNow, back to what Trump said.\nTrump\u2019s previous claim on the topic, made in June 2016, was that Clinton\u2019s State Department \"approved the transfer of 20 percent of America\u2019s uranium holdings to Russia, while nine investors in the deal funneled $145 million to the Clinton Foundation.\"\nPolitiFact National rated it Mostly False -- mainly because there is no evidence of a quid pro quo.\nAs for Trump\u2019s current claim, it\u2019s overstated.\nThe State Department did approve the Uranium One deal, but it didn\u2019t act unilaterally. It was one of nine U.S. government agencies, plus independent federal and state nuclear regulators, that had to sign off on the deal.\nAnd as FactCheck.org noted in a related fact check, while any of the nine agencies could have objected to the deal, only President Barack Obama had the power to veto it.\nEven then, the president can only prohibit such transactions only with \"credible evidence\" that the \"foreign interest exercising control might take action that threatens to impair the national security.\u2019\nOur rating\nTrump says Clinton \"gave up 20 percent of America's uranium supply to Russia.\"\nThe reference is to Russia\u2019s nuclear power agency buying a controlling interest in a Toronto-based company. That company has mines, mills and tracts of land in Wyoming, Utah and other U.S. states equal to about 20 percent of U.S. uranium production capacity (not produced uranium).\nClinton was secretary of state at the time, but she didn\u2019t have the power to approve or reject the deal. The State Department was only one of nine federal agencies that signed off on the deal, and only Obama had the power to veto it.\nFor a statement that contains only an element of truth, our rating is Mostly False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/cbdc6c17-60c1-4ca0-b4e9-84c404095d12", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04231"}
