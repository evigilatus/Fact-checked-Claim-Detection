And one wild theory is spreading on social media: that the incoming vice president will oust President-elect Joe Biden and tap Pence to replace her.\u00a0\n\"I heard a rumor @KamalaHarris is planning on pulling the 25th Amendment on @JoeBiden the minute he is sworn in, and then appointing @MikePence as her Vice-President,\" read one Facebook post. \"Is this true?\"\nIt was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nWe reached out to former Senate candidate Shiva Ayyadurai, who wrote the Facebook post. Ayyadurai \u2014\u00a0who lost in the Massachusetts Republican primary \u2014 did not immediately respond to our email about the claim.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWe also did not hear back from the Biden-Harris campaign.\u00a0\nBut there is no evidence to substantiate this theory.\nA little background:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 25th Amendment says that if the vice president and a majority of the Cabinet declare that the president can no longer carry out his duties, the vice president would become the acting president.\nIn October, following Trump\u2019s diagnosis with COVID-19, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi introduced a bill to establish a commission that could be tasked with determining if a president is no longer fit for office in accordance with the 25th Amendment. Soon after, Trump tweeted without evidence that Pelosi was \"looking at the 25th Amendment in order to replace Joe Biden with Kamala Harris.\" There was no factual basis for that claim either.\nNow that the amendment is in the news again, Biden and Harris have not commented on calls to use it to remove Trump.\n\"President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Harris are focused on their duty \u2014\u00a0preparing to take office on Jan. 20 \u2014\u00a0and will leave it to Vice President Pence, the cabinet and the Congress to act as they see fit,\" Andrew Bates, a spokesperson for the Biden transition, told the New York Times.\u00a0\nWe\u2019ve previously fact-checked other unfounded allegations that hinge on the fears of some conservatives that Biden is a \"Trojan Horse\" for a Harris presidency. Some social media posts have included the inaccurate claim that Pelosi would automatically become Harris\u2019 vice president.\nAnd we find no credible evidence to suggest that there is any discussion of Harris seeking to replace Biden once sworn in. It\u2019s especially unfathomable that Harris, a Democrat, would nominate Pence, a Republican, as her vice president if she replaced Biden. If that were to happen, and Harris were then to leave the office of the president, she would effectively hand over power to the other party \u2014 Pence would become the new president.\u00a0\nThe claim that Harris plans to oust Biden and appoint Pence as her vice president is False.\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click here, for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19144"}
