(A similar tweet from the same account remains up; it says, \"Satan flashed in the ritual.\")\nThe Facebook posts were flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

The photo is real, but it wasn\u2019t captured during Super Bowl LV.\nIn reality, the \"Satan\" incident took place during a 2017 concert The Weeknd gave in Copenhagen, Denmark, as other fact-checkers also reported. Several minutes into his performance of the song \"Reminder,\" the word flashed briefly on a screen behind him, videos posted to YouTube show.\n\nA 2017 YouTube video highlighting what happened in 2017 also circulated widely on Facebook in the wake of The Weeknd\u2019s Super Bowl performance on Feb. 7.\nWe can\u2019t say why the word \"Satan\" was used at the 2017 concert, despite searching for a credible explanation online. But we can say the word did not appear during his Super Bowl halftime show.\nFalse claims about Satan often align with the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory, which holds among other beliefs that the world is run by powerful people who belong to a cabal of Satan-worshipping pedophiles.\nWe rate these Facebook posts False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19090"}
