The group might be hard to define, but most Americans say they are part of it, and many swing voters fall into it. Accordingly, both camps roll out the term frequently in their campaign ads.\n\nThe Obama campaign has a new ad called \"Pay the bills.\" It features a woman named Christie who describes a very ordinary life:\n\nChristie: \"I do the laundry. I pay the bills. I make sure my kids are fed and rested and healthy.\"\n\nAnnouncer: \"Moms like Christie would be stretched even more under Mitt Romney. To fund his tax cuts for millionaires, Romney could take away middle-class deductions for child care, mortgages and college tuition.\"\n\nChristie: \"Mitt Romney? He\u2019s so focused on big business, and tax cuts for the wealthy.

It was a favored target during the Democratic convention.\n\nThe claim in this new ad is more specific than some others we\u2019ve looked at. Here, we\u2019ll examine the premise that Romney\u2019s plan could take away middle-class deductions for child care, mortgages and college tuition.\n\nTo begin with, we\u2019ll note that \"could\" is a very open-ended word. Many things \"could\" happen but that doesn\u2019t mean they are likely to. The ad\u2019s focus on some theoretical possibility should be contrasted against Romney\u2019s promise that he will not raise taxes on the middle class or touch their tax deductions. This came up when Romney was asked about a study that challenged his proposals.\n\n\"They made an assumption that I would reduce the home mortgage-interest deduction,\" Romney said in an interview with Fortune. \"I will not do that for middle-income taxpayers.\"\n\nRomney specifically said he would \"preserve tax preferences for middle-income taxpayers such as homeownership, charitable giving and health care.\"\n\nRomney\u2019s problem is that he has set many goals for his plan, and they tend to conflict with each other. It is difficult, for example, to cut rates, keep tax collections the same, and keep the tax burden the same across all income groups.\n\nBriefly put, Romney would lower tax rates across the board and make up the difference by taxing income that isn\u2019t taxed today. This is called broadening the tax base, and the biggest pots of money there are found in the deductions for home mortgages, charitable donations, state and local taxes and employer-paid health insurance benefits.\n\nRomney has said he would change the rules on tax deductions on higher income households, but he hasn\u2019t provided enough details for any analyst to specifically predict the consequences of his ideas.\n\n The challenge of tinkering with deductions\n\nThe Obama campaign backs up its claim by citing the work of the Tax Policy Center, a joint project of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution. The collaboration includes analysts with past ties to both political parties. The Tax Policy Center reported that in order for Romney to keep some of his main revenue and tax rate goals, he would need to eat into the tax deductions enjoyed by some middle-class households.\n\nDoes it follow that Romney\u2019s plan would \"take away\" those deductions? William Gale, one of the report\u2019s authors, said one should interpret the study more carefully.\n\n\"It is accurate to say that it is not inconsistent with our study to say that those items could be on the block for at least some middle-income earners,\" Gale said. \"But that\u2019s a lot of wiggle room.\"\n\nIn other words, the ad speaks with more certainty and in more sweeping terms than did the underlying study the campaign cites. Gale\u2019s study did not say that all middle-class households would be affected; it found that those making more money would be. In addition, it did not say the outcome was inevitable. Rather, it found that middle-class taxes would go up if Romney stuck to every other goal in his plan. However, if he was flexible on one of the goals, then the middle class could go untouched.\n\nOn the other hand, a study cited by Romney in support of his plan found that the numbers worked when deductions were reduced for households making $100,000 and up. Romney himself has said that would include people who he would characterize as middle class.\n\nAnother Tax Policy Center report cited by the campaign cast doubt on a core premise of Romney\u2019s plan. The report did not assess Romney's plan directly but noted that reducing the most widely used deductions might not produce the revenues needed to offset the ones lost through rate cuts.\n\nIt also cautioned that many scenarios would raise effective rates on middle-income earners, while giving a tax break to people making more. However, it said the numbers could work if lawmakers in both parties were willing to make enough compromises on what they will and will not tax.\n\n\"It is possible to maintain revenues in the face of large marginal tax rate cuts by paring back tax expenditures, but it would be very difficult,\" the report said. \"And the task becomes much harder if another objective is to maintain the progressivity of the federal income tax.\"\n\nThe report authors acknowledge that there is a huge gap between playing with the theoretical possibilities and dealing with political realities.\n\nTax code politics\n\nThe home mortgage deduction \"is a very popular provision,\" said Stephen Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a group focused on government waste and subsidies to the private sector. Ellis said deductions for child care and college tuition enjoy similar broad support.\n\n\"President Obama\u2019s campaign ad ignores the context in which those tax breaks would be \u2018taken away\u2019,\" Ellis said. \"They are only going to be significantly reduced or eliminated in the context of fundamental tax reform that reduces the tax rates for the same filers.\"\n\nMatt Jensen, an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, has written in defense of the feasibility of Romney\u2019s plan. He said the Obama ad gets ahead of the process that would take place on Capitol Hill.\n\n\"I do not believe Romney would do things that he has explicitly said he would not do,\" Jensen said. \"More likely, he (or Congress, really) would tinker with other aspects of the tax reform plan.\"\n\nRomney, Jensen said, would bring certain principles to the tax plan he brings to Congress. The details of how those principles play out cannot be judged today.\n\nWe should note that through his running mate, Paul Ryan, Romney has associated himself with a budget plan that would eliminate the American Opportunity tax credit for college tuition. This is not specifically part of the Romney tax plan but it would hit the pocketbooks of some 3 million households, some of whom would be in the middle class. The credit is worth as much as $2,500 for each college student.\n\nTuition tax deductions, in contrast to the more valuable tax credits, are also in the tax code. Parents can reduce their taxable income by up to $4,000.\n\nOur ruling\n\nThe Obama campaign ad says Romney\u2019s tax plan \"could take away middle-class deductions for child care, mortgages and college tuition.\"\n\nRomney has said he would not reduce the mortgage deduction and has promised not to increase taxes on the middle class. However, he has failed to provide enough details for analysts to model what his plan would actually do.\n\nThere are reasonable concerns that the numbers in Romney\u2019s plan don\u2019t add up. The ad assumes that to get the numbers right, the worst possible outcomes for the middle class are likely. It says some major deductions could be taken away.\n\nAt PolitiFact, we put the burden of proof on the person speaking to back up his or her claim with evidence. The Obama ad is very specific about which deductions might be at risk. The Romney plan might be unrealistic and intentionally vague, but the Obama campaign is filling in the blanks with specific deductions that would appeal to middle-class moms. Romney hasn't said he intends to take away those deductions. And he's specifically said he won't touch the largest of those deductions, the mortgage deduction for the middle class.\n\nWe rate the statement Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10327"}
