Jim Whelan (D-Atlantic) raised that point during a Jan. 9 debate on the Senate floor about the Urban Hope Act. That legislation, passed by the Legislature and quickly signed into law by Gov. Chris Christie, allows nonprofit entities to build and run schools in three failing districts.\n\nBefore casting his vote in favor of the bill, Whelan told his fellow legislators that \"we\u2019ve got to change the conversation\" and consider a longer school year.\n\n\"Let\u2019s look where we are in the world. We\u2019re twenty-sixth,\" said Whelan, a teacher in Atlantic City. \"United States of America is twenty-sixth in school performance in the world.\"\n\nPolitiFact New Jersey found the numbers that back up Whelan\u2019s statistic, but due to the margins of error attached to the average test scores, the 26th ranking may not be completely accurate.\n\nLet\u2019s explain the test we\u2019re talking about.\n\nThe test -- known as the Programme for International Student Assessment, or PISA -- is overseen by the Paris, France-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The test assesses 15- and 16-year-olds for reading, math and science.\n\nThe PISA was administered in 65 countries or economies in 2009, and another 10 participants in 2010. Of those 75 participants, the United States ranks 26 when the mean scores in the three subject areas are averaged out.\n\nAnthony Jackson, vice president for education at Asia Society, a global educational organization, said in an email that such a composite ranking gives a \"broader sense of how student performance in the US (or any nation) compares with that of other nations beyond its performance in any one subject area.\"\n\nAndreas Schleicher, head of the OECD's Indicators and Analysis Division in the Directorate for Education, told us averaging the scores is acceptable, but he cautioned: \"I would still not call this \u2018overall performance\u2019 since there are a number of school subjects not measured by PISA (e.g. history, geography or music).\"\n\nBut rankings may not be as clear-cut when factoring in the margins of error attached to the average scores.\n\nThose margins of error make it difficult to rank countries for both the individual subject areas as well as the composite averages, according to Dana Kelly, co-national project manager of PISA in the United States.\n\n\"It may appear that the U.S. average is lower (or higher) than another country when actually there is not a measurable difference in the average scores,\" Kelly said in an email. \"Likewise, countries \u2018above\u2019 us may not have measurably different average scores from each other so (it) gets even more difficult to figure out where we are in a ranking.\"\n\n\"We understand that people want to know where the US stands, but ranking is just tricky,\" Kelly added.\n\nBeth Schroeder, Whelan\u2019s chief of staff, defended the senator in an email:\n\n\"The point Senator Whelan was trying to make still stands. By any measure, the United States is lagging behind the rest of the world in school performance. Whether we\u2019re 26th or some other rank once you factor in the margin of error, we should be striving to have the best educational system in the world, and shouldn\u2019t settle for anything but first.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nDuring a debate on the Senate floor, Whelan claimed the \"United States of America is twenty-sixth in school performance in the world.\"\n\nBased on the most recent international assessments, the senator\u2019s statistic is on target. After averaging out the mean scores in reading, math and science, the United States ranks 26 out of 75 participating countries or economies.\n\nBut since those mean scores are subject to margins of error -- which could alter the rankings -- we rate the statement Mostly True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11665"}
