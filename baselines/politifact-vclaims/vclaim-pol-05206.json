Andrew Bednall. Case records show Bednall\u2019s ex-wife had objected to Bradley representing Bednall. The court-appointed attorney for their son also expressed\u00a0concerns.\nEthics rules prevent lawyers from having sexual relationships with clients. However, they do not prevent lawyers from representing clients if a romantic relationship existed prior to the attorney-client relationship.\nBradley responded in court papers filed in 2005. She said she and Bednall previously had a romantic relationship that \"we both believed might result in marriage.\" She wrote that that part of the relationship ended in November 2002, but that they continued to date \"on a nonexclusive basis\" at the time of the custody case.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin LeMahieu\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a TV interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It takes quite a while on Election Day to load those ballots, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe judge on the case declined to remove Bradley from the case on ethical grounds, according to the public filings.\nBradley\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t respond to our requests to back the statement we\u2019re checking.\nFamily law experts\nWe talked with five lawyers, four from the Milwaukee area and one from Madison, who have more than 100 years of combined experience in family law cases.\nRetired Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Lee Wells, who headed the family law division for eight years and still handles family cases as a reserve judge and mediator, said he has seen non-family law attorneys handle family cases and has seen lawyers in family cases represent someone they had or were having a relationship with.\nBut he said he couldn\u2019t characterize how common it is, partly because there likely were instances where lawyers didn\u2019t disclose their lack of family law experience, or didn\u2019t disclose that they were representing someone they had been involved with romantically.\nThe other four lawyers, however, said that in their decades of experience, they could not recall even one case like Bradley\u2019s, in which a lawyer represents a former boyfriend in a contested family law case.\nOur rating\nBradley says her representation of an ex-boyfriend \"who was then my friend\" in a family law case is \"something that lawyers do on a regular basis.\"\nBut we found no evidence of that.\nFour of five longtime family law lawyers told us such representation is not done regularly -- they had never seen a lawyer represent a former boyfriend in a contested family law case. The other expert said he could recall cases similar to Bradley\u2019s, but couldn\u2019t say whether they occurred on a regular basis.\nWe rate Bradley\u2019s statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05206"}
