Like bridges. More specifically, the United States is no longer adopting them, while China is. It has become a regular talking point for the Republican/Possibly Real Estate Presidential candidate in the recent press appearance. The following are some examples: \"We are rebuilding China. I don't know if you know that. They're building bridges. They're building airports. They're building cities, new cities. When was the last time you saw a bridge built in the United States? We don't have bridges being built. \"We have bridges falling.\" - Trump on CNN... state of the union on April 17, 2011. \"Whenever the last time - if you go to China, as an example - bridges are being built, huge bridges are being built. When was the last time we built a bridge in this country, except for a little game?\" - Trump at a press conference in New Hampshire on 27 April 2011. Didn't the United States come back in the bridge-building game? We called the Federal Department of Transport to get data on federal spending on bridges over the last decade. The press office prepared a report on committed funds for the replacement, repair and maintenance of fast bridges for the financial years 2001 to 2010. The report shows a steady upward trend in federal spending (in other words, it does not include state financing and domestic bridges): from $4.8 billion in 2001; to $6.8 billion in 2008; and then jumped to $9.4 billion and $8.5 billion in 2009 and 2010 as a result of the flow of funds from the economic stimulus package. It is not that the United States does not spend more on bridges, Geoffrey Solsby, spokesman for the American Association of Roadbuilders and Transport. It's not nearly enough to keep pace. Over the past 30 years, the number of cars and paid miles had doubled, as he said, yet the quantity of roads and bridges had only increased by 7 per cent. \"We didn't build it, and it came anyway,\" said Solsby. According to the story of April 28, 2011, in Economist, America lags behind the rest of the industrialized world in terms of investing in infrastructure such as bridges. \"Total public expenditure on transport and water infrastructure has declined steadily since the 1960s, and now stands at 2.4 per cent of GDP,\" notes the story. \"Europe, by contrast, invests 5 per cent of GDP in its infrastructure, while China races towards the future by 9 per cent. American spending as a share of GDP has not approached European levels for more than 50 years. Over that time, funds for capital investments, operations and maintenance have been steadily reduced.\" Moreover, the article, the Budget Office of the non-partisan Congress of the Government, estimates that \"America needs to spend an additional $20 billion a year only to maintain its current infrastructure, insufficient levels.\" This does not include building new bridges. In the 2010 Bridge Stock Report, the best road magazine analysed the situation of over 600,000 bridges in the country and concluded that the \"high rise\" of a number of them was structurally incomplete or out of date. Solsby said that politicians on both sides of the corridor recognized the problem. The dilemma is how to pay for it. States are financially constrained by the recession. The federal dollars also extend. ARTBA wants to see an increase in gasoline tax to finance more bridges, Soolby said, but as gas prices rise, \"Is this politically easy?\" \"From one perspective, Trump is right,\" said Solsby. \"Everyone on this planet realizes that investments in infrastructure are a major point of adrenaline for the economy. But it's not like we're not building bridges. We are. It's just slow.\" The bridge experts have spoken to a number of key bridges that have recently been completed or are well under way. * Hoover bypass bridge, opened in October 2010. The New York Times called it an engineering wonder and a panicked nightmare. The 1,900-foot bridge over the Colorado River Valley, which connects Arizona with Nevada, is the seventh highest bridge in the world and the longest single-range legendary bridge in the western hemisphere. In other words, it's not just a small game. * The San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, \"Main seismic regression,\" with a total project length of 8.4 miles. The cost of the Eastern Sahel region alone is estimated at $5.5 billion. It is expected to open in both directions in 2013. * Replacement of the 1.1-mile Woodrow Wilson Bridge across the Potomac River, linking Maryland to Virginia, which was completed in 2008 with a capacity of 295,000 vehicles per day. *I-35W over the Mississippi River in Minneapolis, replacing the one that collapsed tragically in August 2007, killing 13 people. A new alternative bridge of 10 liters - at a cost of $234 million - was opened a little over a year later. * Willis Avenue Bridge over the Harlem River, which connects Manhattan and Bronx in New York City. Last summer was completed at a cost of $614 million. The bridge was shipped 2,400 tons by two boats. This is by no means a comprehensive list, just a sample. That's all. The U.S. is still working on bridge building. So Trump overstepped his claims. But to allow the possibility that Trump was exercising a little exaggeration to make a point about the need to prioritize investment in infrastructure for things such as new bridges - an issue that the data suggest is a valid and pressing concern - we evaluate the Trump statement half right.
