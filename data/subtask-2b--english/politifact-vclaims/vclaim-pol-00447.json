Did the ACA create equal coverage of mental and physical health?\nWe decided to investigate. We contacted the Biden campaign and never heard back.\nBut our own reporting shows that while Biden\u2019s claim is mostly accurate concerning the health law\u2019s provisions, implementation has fallen short of achieving the goal of parity.\nOne problem, two laws\nThe ACA, which became law in 2010, does include provisions meant to strengthen access to and insurance coverage of mental health care. But it wasn\u2019t the first statute to take on this challenge.\nTwo years earlier, before Barack Obama became president, Congress passed the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act. It said that, if insurance offered by large employers \u2014 an organization employing more than 50 people \u2014 included mental health benefits, it had to structure those benefits, as well as associated copayments or caps on visits, equal to \u2014 \"at parity\" with \u2014physical health benefits.\nA key thing to note, though, is that this 2008 law did not specifically mandate coverage of mental health services.\nObamacare went further by requiring most plans to cover mental health and substance abuse. And it extended the parity requirement beyond large-employer-sponsored coverage to plans offered by small employers and those bought on the individual market.\nHealth economists estimate that the ACA extended mental health benefits to 62 million people.\n\"It substantially expanded the reach of the parity law,\" said Sherry Glied, a health economist and dean at New York University.\nBoth Glied and Richard Frank, a health economics professor at the Harvard Medical School, agreed that the first part of Biden\u2019s claim checks out. The health law certainly brought in new standards for parity and expanded the rules already on the books. (Frank and Glied both served in the Obama administration.)\nBut because\u00a0 the law operates in tandem with the earlier legislation, one could also reasonably question whether it constitutes a \"fundamental breakthrough\" or represents the next step in a broader trajectory.\nHoles in the system\nPerhaps more important, though, is the current state of parity. To be sure, the ACA\u2019s requirements created a clear set of parity standards. In some respects, though, these standards exist on paper but don\u2019t always play out in practice.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It\u2019s huge that the guaranteed protections are there,\" said JoAnn Volk, a research professor at Georgetown University. \"The challenges remain in delivering on them.\"\nThat\u2019s because some coverage inequities are easier to spot than others. If a health plan caps how many times you can see a psychiatrist but doesn\u2019t do so for an allergist or oncologist, that\u2019s a clear violation. If mental health care visits have higher coinsurance than do physical health visits, that\u2019s also obviously illegal.\nEvidence suggests those quantitative barriers are less common now than they were before the passage of these two laws. Those changes, Glied said, have most clearly benefited people with severe psychiatric conditions.\nBut other barriers remain \u2014 many of which are quite nuanced and therefore more difficult to spot and enforce.\nFor instance, health plans aren\u2019t supposed to require prior authorization for a psychiatrist visit unless they also do so for a \"comparable\" physical health service. The problem, of course, is how the word \"comparable\" is defined and interpreted.\n\"Even if you\u2019re not trying to exploit the ambiguities but are trying to do a good job, you still might get into some controversial situations where folks might disagree, and disagree on a legit basis,\" Frank said.\nAnd, both Frank and Glied noted, there are cases in which insurance plans might try to take advantage of those ambiguities.\nTake, for instance, the question of \"medical necessity.\" Insurance plans can argue that a mental health service isn\u2019t required for someone\u2019s well-being. Advocates argue that, even in the wake of the parity laws, that argument is used as an excuse to deny care, and that it is used more often for psychiatric cases than for, say, treating someone with diabetes or a hip injury.\nThese barriers more often affect people with less severe mental health conditions, but who still require care, Glied said.\nStates have amped up their enforcement, in part due to federal support, Volk said. But they often rely on reports from consumers who have experienced parity violations, which assumes people will realize their plan has broken the law.\nAnd issues exist beyond parity. Research suggests that insurance networks still fall short when it comes to including an adequate or even robust panel of behavioral health providers who accept their coverage.\nThat\u2019s in part because of distinctions in mental health care \u2014 whether someone specializes in cognitive behavioral therapy or talk therapy, for instance, or a psychiatrist\u2019s age or gender or life experiences. Plus, many behavioral health specialists simply don\u2019t take insurance.\nThose issues, Frank said, come in part because of the distinct complexity of mental health coverage.\n\"Mental health is not just one thing \u2014 it\u2019s a whole bunch of illnesses. You want people to get the care they need,\" Frank said. That means that devising effective policy \"is a balancing act.\"\nOur ruling\nBiden told CNN that the ACA \"made parity between mental health and physical health,\" describing that policy as a \"fundamental breakthrough.\"\nIt\u2019s clear the 2010 law\u2019s parity requirements had a major impact: 62 million people gaining coverage is nothing to sneeze at.\nBut the ACA wasn\u2019t the first piece of legislation to take this issue on. And major issues remain when it comes to making sure insurance treats mental health needs the same way it does physical health ones.\nBiden\u2019s statement is accurate, but it would benefit from additional information.
