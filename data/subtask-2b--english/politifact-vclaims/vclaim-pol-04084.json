Rob Portman says Ted Strickland earned $400,000 a year as a lobbyist after leaving Ohio for Washington.", "truth_label": "half-true", "date": "stated on October 17, 2016 in at a debate in Columbus, Ohio:", "title": "Portman, Strickland duel over who's richer", "text": "There were times during the second debate between Sen. Rob Portman and former Gov. Ted Strickland in which the two politicians quibbled over who\u2019s richer.\nThe feuding over fat wallets emerged in the first debate when Strickland announced that he\u2019d calculated Portman\u2019s hourly earnings at $333.57, after factoring in assets and his $174,000 salary as a U.S. senator. Strickland, a Democrat, juxtaposed the dollar figure with Portman\u2019s stance against raising the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour.\nPortman didn\u2019t dispute the figure, but in the second matchup between the candidates, he hit back with a calculation of his own.\n\"(Strickland) went to Washington, D.C., and he became a lobbyist,\" Portman said. \"He made $400,000 a year. So he wasn\u2019t living on minimum wage, but he was working against the interests of Ohioans, including the people he used to represent.\"\nStrickland sounded surprised, responding, \"The senator said I made $400,000. My ... oh, senator, that\u2019s a big whopper. I\u2019ve never made $400,000 in my life.\"\nWe decided to take a look at Strickland\u2019s earnings. Was he really a lobbyist pulling in $400,000?\nThere are some issues with Portman\u2019s attack. But he isn\u2019t far off with Strickland\u2019s post-Congress earnings, if you\u2019re willing to include a variety of compensation into the picture.\nThe first issue with Portman\u2019s claim: Strickland was never a registered lobbyist.\nAfter losing his re-election bid to Gov. John Kasich, Strickland took a job with the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank. An amended 2015 financial disclosure filing shows that Strickland earned $199,125 between April 2014 to March 2015.\nStrickland headed up the political action fund for the think tank. His position is listed as \"director/counselor\" on the group\u2019s tax forms. So technically, he was not a lobbyist himself, but he oversaw the group\u2019s lobbying arm.\nWhen asked why Portman called Strickland a lobbyist, campaign spokesperson Michawn Rich said, \"He did not misspeak. Ted ran the lobbying arm of the Center for American Progress. It's a fact.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second problem is that the earnings in question are not as straightforward as a $400,000 salary. You reach that amount by counting income from various jobs and retirement funds.\nThe Center for American Progress Action Fund reports on its 2014 IRS Form 990 that Strickland earned \"other compensation\" in the amount of $13,623. The 990 form reports compensation over nine months, and Strickland was there for a year. So if you divide $13,623 by nine, monthly compensation comes to $1,513. Accounting for a year\u2019s time in that position, Strickland would have made about $18,164 in addition to the reported $199,125 income.\nStrickland also disclosed $20,000 in earnings from consulting at the Bipartisan Policy Center, and $25,000 from working as a mediator with the Washington law firm Taft, Stettinius & Hollister. He reported $36,700 from his state retirement, and $25,500 from a PNC Bank-administered IRA fund.\nStrickland is also earning a federal pension from his 12 years in Congress, which is calculated by taking an average of the three-highest salaried years in Congress, multiplying the average by 1.7 percent, and multiplying the result by years of congressional service.\nStrickland\u2019s three highest-earning years in office would have been 2004, 2005, and 2006, so the average comes to $161,800.\nStrickland was in Congress for 12 years, and 12 x 1.7 percent equals 20.4 percent. We will estimate Strickland\u2019s pension, then, to be about $33,000 a year. (No more math after this, okay?)\nStrickland salaryCreate your own infographics\nDavid Bergstein, spokesperson for Strickland\u2019s campaign, disagrees that retirement earnings should be included as part of Strickland\u2019s earnings in Washington. \u00a0\nSubtracting the IRA and retirement fund, Strickland\u2019s total annual earnings from a few gigs would be $295,289 \u2014 or $141.97 an hour.\nOur ruling\nPortman said Strickland \"went to Washington, D.C., and he became a lobbyist. He made $400,000 a year.\"\nTechnically Strickland wasn\u2019t a lobbyist; he oversaw a liberal think tank\u2019s lobbying and activism arm. As for his income, if you add his disclosed earnings, figures from public IRS forms and retirement income, you get an estimate around $357,000. Not everyone would tally up annual wealth this way.\nPortman\u2019s statement is partially accurate but a bit sloppy in the details, so we rate his statement Half True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/8b114f18-b218-4ac2-9ffa-4217a5401af0", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04084"}
