We consulted three different sources -- UNAIDS, WHO and the Global Burden of Disease Study -- and used the highest available estimate.\nHere\u2019s what the numbers show:\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDeaths in 2012\n\n\n\n\nHIV/AIDS\n\n\n1.6 million\n\n\n\n\nMalaria\n\n\n0.8 million\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTB\n\n\n1.3 \u00a0million\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n3.7 \u00a0million\n\n\n\n\nIndoor air pollution total\n\n\n4.2 \u00a0million\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nAs you can see, the total mortality from the three diseases comes to 3.7 million in 2012, less than the 4.2 million people estimated to have died from diseases attributable to indoor air pollution.\nRockall used different underlying estimates to reach a total of 2.9 million deaths due to the three diseases. Our total is higher, but we found no estimates from any source that undercut his basic point.\nDeaths from indoor air pollution are higher than the sum of deaths from the world\u2019s major leading infectious diseases.\nA note of caution\nCounting deaths from indoor air pollution is more complicated than tracking deaths from HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis.\nMark Wilson, professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan, said it is easier to identify someone who has HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis.\n\"Much more difficult is defining how one dies from indoor air pollution because it will never be the sole immediate cause of death,\" Wilson said. \"Rather, a variety of physiological, immunological and toxicological processes would compromise someone\u2019s health, such that the cause might be defined as some sort of respiratory insufficiency, asthma, heart disease, etcetera.\"\nThe WHO study made various assumptions to link diseases such as lung cancer, pneumonia, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and ischemic heart disease to indoor air pollution.\nOur ruling\nRockall said more people die of indoor air pollution than HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria combined.\nWe compared 2012 estimates of indoor air pollution deaths to a range of estimates for the three infectious diseases for 2012 and later.\nNo matter how we did it, the deaths due to indoor air pollution trumped those due to HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis combined.\nBut an epidemiologist offered the caveat that the indoor air pollution study relied on assumptions that introduce a greater chance of uncertainty than counts of deaths from the leading infectious diseases.\nFor that reason, we rate this statement Mostly True.
