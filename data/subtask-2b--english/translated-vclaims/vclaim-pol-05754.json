The business manager of Fox Sandra Smith presented a grim picture of the work of New Jersey Goff. Chris Christy She said that 90 million Americans were unemployed or not in the labour force at all. For those who work, Smith said that wages were not budging. Christy responded with a story about a woman he met in New Hampshire and told him how she was worried every month that she wouldn't have enough to pay her bills. \"There are tens of millions of Americans living this way after the worst recovery from the economic recession since World War II,\" said Christy. Is the United States in the middle of \"the worst recovery from the economic recession since the Second World War\"? Coolly enough, the Fed site in Minneapolis has a tool that allows you to compare the recession again until 1948. Here's what the Fed's website tells us. This recovery is not the worst when it comes to jobs. The Federal Reserve measures the cumulative increase in the percentage of employment from the point where each recession ends and the recovery begins. During the period of recovery from the 2001 recession, employment did not creep out of the negative territory for approximately 28 months. In comparison, in the post-crisis recovery period in 2007, at 21 months, the United States began adding jobs that exceeded the number that existed at the beginning of the recovery. The following chart measures the image of jobs after every recession since the Second World War. The red line is the current recovery: Seventy-six months after the beginning of the recovery, the economy has now achieved cumulative job gains of 8.9 per cent. After 76 months of recovery from the 2001 recession, cumulative gains were 5.4 per cent. There is another way to measure job trends. You can look at the gains compared to the pre-recession labour feat. With this criterion, it took 76 months to match the number of jobs in the economy before the contraction in 2007, which is the worst since the Second World War. The recovery after the 2001 recession took 46 months to reach the same point. However, the job losses in 2001 were much smaller, with recovery less likely. On January 10, 2021, bloggers in the story of \"The Insubordination Act - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" By Samantha Buterman: January 11, 2021, but Christy has a point if you look at economic output, as measured by GDP, or GDP. Given GDP growth, the current recovery is in fact the slowest since the recession. Here too is the graph: The current recovery was better than the one that followed the 1980 recession for some quarters, but while the current recession generally showed slow gains, the 1980 recovery started. The cumulative increase in real GDP for the current recovery is 14.2 per cent. This is worse than 17.2 per cent recovery in 2001. Tara Sinclair is actually a leading economist and professor of economics at George Washington University. \"We have just surpassed 61 months of sustained employment growth, and longer if you look only at private jobs,\" said Sinclair Poletti Fuckett. \"On that scale, recovery is longer since World War II, so this hardly seems worse. On the other hand, the recovery has been remarkably slow, and we have not returned to the trend in GDP or employment that we expected without stagnation.\" Sinclair added that even in terms of GDP, it is difficult to call it the worst recovery because the country is emerging from what economists consider to be the deepest recession since the Second World War. The Governor, Christy, said that the United States was experiencing the worst economic recovery from recession since the Second World War. Christy's campaign did not respond to our request for comment. The truth is that it depends on what it measures. Given the growth of GDP, he is right. In looking at the employment picture, the recovery in 2001 was worse. Christy's claim is partly accurate. We value it half right. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/600cb3a9-686a-4390-8d06-4d6d4b7bec4", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05754"}
