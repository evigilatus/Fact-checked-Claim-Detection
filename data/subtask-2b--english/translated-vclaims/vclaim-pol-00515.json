The article shows a picture of both, with the following quote of Trump attributed to the Queen: \"He's really just an amazing person. Very thoughtful, you know.

It appears that the statement attributed to her originated in an anonymous article on an online forum, and according to the information centre at Buckingham Palace, the Queen does not interview or speak publicly about political matters.
