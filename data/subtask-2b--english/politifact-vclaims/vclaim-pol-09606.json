Dianne Feinstein says there's 'no regulation' of commercial drones", "text": "So, the government can\u2019t use a weaponized drone to strike down a U.S. citizen who\u2019s \"not engaged in combat,\" says Attorney General Eric Holder.\n\nBut can paparazzi use camera-laden drones to violate Hollywood\u2019s privacy?\n\nU.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein says so.\n\nFeinstein, chair of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, chatted with Hardball host Chris Matthews the day after Sen. Rand Paul\u2019s 13-hour filibuster over U.S. drone policy.\n\nPaul was concerned about a March 4, 2013, letter from the attorney general that didn\u2019t appear to rule out drone strikes against U.S. citizens on American soil. A new letter satisfied his curiosity.\n\nBut his March 6 \"drone rant,\" as the Wall Street Journal called it, raised criticism from lawmakers, including Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., \u00a0and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.\n\nOn MSNBC, Matthews asked Feinstein: Was Rand \"playing to the paranoia in people\"?\n\nFeinstein replied that armed drones are a \"new technology\" and a \"very dangerous weapon,\" that she wants to keep out of the hands of other nations. Then she said:\n\n\"We have no regulation of drones in the United States in their commercial use. You can see drones some day hovering over the homes of Hollywood luminaries, violating privacy.\n\n\"This question has to be addressed. And we need rules of operation on the border, by police, by commercial use, and also by military and intelligence use.\n\n\"So this is now a work in progress. We are taking a look at it on the Intelligence Committee, trying to draft some legislation. The administration is looking at a rules playbook as to how these won't be used and how they will be used.\"\n\nAbout armed drones, we\u2019ve heard plenty in recent days, thanks to Paul.\n\nBut Feinstein\u2019s privacy claim caught our eye. Do \"we have no regulation of drones in the United States in their commercial use\"?\n\nThe FAA\n\nWe gave Feinstein\u2019s office a day or two to explain her comments, but her staff didn\u2019t offer an on-the-record response.\n\nSo we chatted with experts on drones, also known as \"unmanned aircraft systems,\" and read up on Federal Aviation Administration rules.\n\nThat\u2019s right \u2014 there are FAA rules. Do they address \"commercial use\" of drones?\n\nYes.\n\nThe only way for folks who don\u2019t work in government to get FAA approval to fly a drone in U.S. airspace is to get something called an \"experimental airworthiness certificate.\"\n\nAnd the FAA doesn\u2019t give them out for commercial use.\n\n\"The FAA's rules \u2014 once you can find them \u2014 are pretty clear: You cannot use a drone for a commercial purpose without a permit,\" said Matt Waite, who founded the Drone Journalism Lab at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln.\n\n\"And, the FAA has made it pretty clear that those permits are really only for research and development and in very limited circumstances,\" he added. \"So, it amounts to a total ban on commercial (use).\"\n\nWaite would know: \u00a0Students and faculty in his lab \"research the ethical, legal and regulatory issues involved in using pilotless aircraft to do journalism.\"\n\nAnd even he hasn\u2019t yet been able to score an FAA certificate.\n\nFull disclosure: Before Waite joined the University of Nebraska in 2011 to teach reporting and digital product development, he was an employee of the Tampa Bay Times who helped create PolitiFact.\n\nThe Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, a nonprofit group that represents members interested in promoting drone technology, also told us that Feinstein was mistaken.\n\n\"There are a number of regulations on commercial flights of unmanned systems,\" said Melanie Hinton, a spokeswoman for the group.\n\nNot only that, Hinton said, but currently, that includes \"no commercial use.\"\n\nThat looks to us like the opposite of what Feinstein said.\n\nStill, Feinstein has a point about privacy, said Ryan Calo, an assistant law professor at the University of Washington and author of the article, \"The Drone as Privacy Catalyst.\"\n\nHe notes federal privacy laws haven\u2019t kept pace with drone technology, and that while the FAA currently bans commercial use of drones, Congress has asked for new regulations for civilian drones by 2015.\n\nLawmakers want to \"safely accelerate\" the use of such drones, according to the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012, a piece of legislation that Feinstein supported.\n\n\"In this respect, she is correct,\" Calo said.\n\nStill, the agency has said it will address concerns about privacy as it develops a new regulatory framework. It\u2019s just not yet clear whether the new rules will satisfy privacy advocates. That\u2019s because it's still in the middle of rulemaking, and plans more public outreach.\n\nThe Electronic Privacy Information Center, for example, petitioned the FAA to take privacy into account as it drafts its rules. The FAA agreed, saying the month before Feinstein\u2019s comment that it \"intends to address these issues through engagement and collaboration with the public.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

Still, the landscape is changing. At Congress\u2019 direction, the FAA is drafting new regulations. How those rules will address privacy concerns, it's too soon to tell. But it's inaccurate to say there\u2019s \"no regulation.\" We rate her statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09606"}
