Clinton reiterated its recognition that its use of a private e-mail server was a mistake, as well as its assertion that all of its work-related correspondence had been sent using government-run e-mail servers, which meant that all those e-mails should be in government files somewhere. Anyway, she said, all her e-mails had been launched. \"I think anyone actually looked at this concluded that I now put all my e-mails,\" she said. \"Go ask others about their e-mails. Ask everyone who's in the public office. I did it, and I did it because I thought it was the right thing to do.\" So have all the e-mails been posted? Literally, no. Clinton says she has about 60,000 e-mails on her own server during the four years she's been Secretary of State. She and her staff had deleted more than 31,000 without any government review in December 2014 on the grounds that they were personal correspondence and had nothing to do with her government function. The remaining 30,940 were handed over to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in paper form, for review and preservation. In March 2015, a committee of the House of Representatives asked Clinton to hand over her servant to see whether the sensitive material had been removed. In August, Clinton authorized the transfer. She then asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to make the work-related correspondence public, which she had begun in May 2015. The last batch, consisting of approximately 3,800 pages, was issued on 29 February. Clinton has consistently insisted that the e-mails did not contain any confidential information at the time they were sent or received for correspondence. Turns out she was right. 11 July 2016: On the basis of information available to the public at that time, it appeared to be correct. Subsequently, the report of the Federal Bureau of Investigation of July 2016 revealed that she was not right. Although this does not affect our judgement on this statement, we have downgraded another statement that it never sent or received classified material, and assessed that error.) The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" By Samantha Buterman \u2022 January 11, 2021, but ultimately, 2,093 e-mails were given a form of classification, including 22 now called \"extreme secrecy,\" which was completely withheld from the public. The rest have been revised. The 22 \"secret\" mails were part of seven e-mail chains covering 37 pages. They were not confidential at the time they were sent. However, a few additional e-mails were also not issued, although they were not considered confidential. Nineteen were exchanges between Clinton and President Barack Obama, which covered eight different chains. They have been blocked by the law governing the release of presidential documents, with a view to encouraging an open exchange of views between the President and his staff. One e-mail was blocked at the request of an unidentified law enforcement agency. With regard to communications that Clinton considered personal and private, it was not clear whether any of those e-mails had been retrieved. In September, Bloomberg reported that the FBI had obtained the server from a company called Planet River Network in Colorado and recovered those deleted e-mails. In October, McLatchy stated that some e-mail had been synced with the cloud storage system operated by Dato. However, Maclatchi mentioned \"controversial accounts of whether developments could lead to the retrieval of any of Clinton's personal e-mails of more than 31,000, which she said she deleted from her own server when she delivered her work-related e-mail to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, upon request, in December 2014.\" This is a rather critical point, as the Republicans in Congress questioned whether any of these \"personal\" e-mails contained government works. The spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Lauren Hickey, said that the documents released contained only business-related e-mails delivered by Clinton. No additional material that may have been recovered by the FBI has been released. Our rule, Clinton, said, \"I have now placed all my e-mails.\" In fact, only half of the e-mails sent or received by Clinton were posted on their own e-mail server. Clinton &apos; s comments focus on e-mails that she and her staff consider relevant to work. Clinton says that the unavailable half is personal and private. The problem is that it was Clinton and her crew who decided to do so. These letters - more than 30,000 - were not available for public review, and it is not quite clear that they can be retrieved. Clinton &apos; s statement is partially accurate but out of context. We value it half right. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f53c15fc-28b4-4025-8158-433c006cc4", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05168"}
