Gwen Moore says", "text": "Domestic violence is so common that one in four women and one in seven men \"have experienced severe physical violence by an intimate partner,\" according to a national survey done by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nSo, could it also be true that incidents of domestic violence have fallen dramatically?\n\nOn Dec. 11, 2012, U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore, D-Wis., and 119 other members of Congress signed a letter calling on House leaders to hold a vote on re-authorizing the Violence Against Women Act.\n\nMoore was among the lead writers of the letter, which declared that since the federal law was adopted in 1994, \"cases of domestic violence have fallen by 67 percent.\"\n\nNearly two decades have passed, but a two-thirds drop is sizable.\n\nIs Moore correct on the number? And, if so, to what extent is the law responsible for the decline?\n\nThe law and the numbers\n\nThe Violence Against Women Act gives money to state and local law enforcement entities to investigate and prosecute violent crimes against women. After the law\u2019s adoption in 1994, Congress re-authorized it in 2000 and 2005, but failed to do so before its session ended in December 2012. Supporters of reauthorization hope to take up the matter again in 2013, possibly as early as January, said Moore spokeswoman Nicole Williams.\n\nMoore, of Milwaukee, is a longtime advocate for domestic violence victims. In December 2010, we rated as True her statement that in Wisconsin, \"deaths from domestic violence\" were \"at the highest in 10 years.\"\n\nIn the latest attempt to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, versions of the 67 percent decrease claim were also made by others: the White House, in a fact sheet; the left-leaning MoveOn.org political advocacy group, in a TV ad; and a U.S. Justice Department official, in testimony to Congress.\n\nWhen we asked Moore\u2019s spokeswoman for evidence to back the figure, Williams cited a Justice Department report from September 2011.\n\nBut we found a more recent report from the department, issued in November 2012, two weeks before Moore\u2019s letter. Williams said \"we are now transitioning to using\" the figures in that report.\n\nThe new report was based on \"nonfatal victimizations reported and not reported to the police\" against persons age 12 or older from a nationally representative sample of U.S. households.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in remarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first finding in the report: from 1994 to 2010, the rate of nonfatal intimate-partner violence in the U.S. declined by 64 percent. The rate dropped from 9.8 victimizations per 1,000 persons age 12 or older to 3.6 per 1,000.\n\nIntimate partner violence was defined to include rape, sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, and simple assault by a current or former spouse, boyfriend, or girlfriend.\n\nThe 64 percent figure is nearly as high as the 67 percent decrease Moore claimed.\n\nBut Moore mentioned the Violence Against Women Act and the decrease in the same breath, not saying one caused the other, but suggesting there was a strong connection. So let\u2019s see what role the law played in reducing domestic violence.\n\nWhy are numbers declining?\n\nThe Violence Against Women Act contains provisions that could lead to a reduction in domestic violence -- through raising awareness of the offense as a crime, locking up violators and deterring potential offenders.\nAccording to a May 2012 report by the Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan arm of Congress, the law provides grants to, among other things:\n\n\nHelp fund state and local prosecutions of violent crimes against women.\n\nEncourage state and local arrest policies for domestic violence cases.\n\nEducate and train judges and court personnel on domestic violence laws.\n\nHelp state and local governments enter data on domestic violence into national databases.\n\nEstablish a national domestic violence hotline fund and fund battered women\u2019s shelters.\n\n\nThe National Network to End Domestic Violence, which is pushing for reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, credits the law for declines in domestic violence.\n\nAnd a 2002 University of North Carolina study estimated that the law had saved billions of dollars in social costs by reducing incidents of domestic violence.\n\nBut it\u2019s also clear that other factors bear on the decline.\n\nCarnegie Mellon University researchers in 2003 concluded that three other factors were key in declines in domestic violence incidents between 1993 and 1998 -- an increase in legal services for victims; improvement in women\u2019s economic status; and the aging of the population.\n\nBarbara Paradiso, director of the Center on Domestic Violence at the University of Colorado Denver, told us that the Violence Against Women Act is one reason for the decline in domestic violence. But experts debate over what factors are most responsible, she said.\n\nOur rating\n\nU.S. Rep. Gwen Moore said that since the Violence Against Women Act was adopted in 1994, \"cases of domestic violence have fallen by 67 percent.\"\n\nHer statement is generally on the money, though a bit dated. It also needs some clarification -- namely that there are factors in addition to the law that are linked to the decrease.\n\nWe rate Moore\u2019s statement Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09854"}
