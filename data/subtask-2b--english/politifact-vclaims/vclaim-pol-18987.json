So if Republican President Donald Trump is successful in his stated desire to get a successor confirmed before his term expires, conservatives would hold a 6-3 majority on the high court.\nThe situation creates a fascinating case study in partisan consistency \u2014 or the lack thereof \u2014 since it\u2019s basically a mirror image of 2016.\u00a0\nThen, the passing of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia cleared the way for Democratic President Barack Obama to nominate Merrick Garland in March 2016. Republicans who controlled the Senate protested the election year nomination, refusing to hold a confirmation hearing or vote.\nWisconsin\u2019s Democratic Senator, Tammy Baldwin, spoke in 2016 and again this year about what she felt the Senate\u2019s responsibility should be.\nThat makes this a good time to break out our Flip-O-Meter, and with it our requisite reminder:\u00a0 We\u2019re not measuring whether any change in position is good policy or good politics. We\u2019re just examining whether a public official has been consistent in his or her stated views.\nPolitiFact National gave a Full Flop rating to Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Democratic Minority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer for switching their views on this topic since 2016.\nHas Baldwin also changed her stance?\nHer position in 2016\nWe should first note the timing in 2016 was different.\nGinsburg\u2019s death sparked a nomination fight that begins about a month and a half before the election \u2014 at a time when early voting has begun in some states. Garland, on the other hand, was nominated a full eight months before the 2016 election, where Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton. So we\u2019ll keep that difference in mind as we analyze Baldwin\u2019s stance.\nWith a president from her party on the way out the door, Baldwin pushed strongly for the Republican-controlled Senate to put Garland\u2019s nomination to a vote. She referenced the time left to the election in one interview.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn April 2016, she told Green Bay\u2019s Fox 11 News, \"President Obama was elected in 2012 to a full four-year term, not a three year and one-month term, and we can\u2019t afford I think in this country an empty seat on the Supreme Court for nearly a full year.\"\nBut other times she referenced no such qualifier.\n\"It's the constitutional duty of the President to select a Supreme Court nominee and the Senate has the responsibility to give that nominee fair consideration with a hearing and a vote,\" she said in a March 2016 news release. \"Our job is to fulfill our constitutional duties and Senate Republicans need to end their partisan obstruction and do their jobs on this high court vacancy.\"\nIn August 2016, closer to the timing of this vacancy, Baldwin was still pushing for a vote, noting in a tweet that Garland had been waiting 147 days. She regularly attached #DoYourJob to her tweets calling for that action.\nHer position in 2020\nBaldwin\u2019s position in 2020 hinges on the differences in timing and the precedent created by the Senate\u2019s inaction in 2016.\nBaldwin\u2019s Sept. 19, 2020, statement said this: \"The election that will determine our next President and control of the Senate is only 45 days away. Voters across America should be allowed to cast their ballots first, before a Supreme Court nomination and confirmation process moves forward.\"\nThe release noted the Senate had \"put in place the standard\" in 2016 that Supreme Court nominations wouldn\u2019t move forward in an election year. And she noted some people have already cast their votes for president.\nBaldwin\u2019s staff noted the Senate has never confirmed a nomination to the Supreme Court this close to a presidential election, according to the Congressional Research Service.\nOur ruling\nDefending her 2020 position, Baldwin notes the change in precedent, as she argues the Republicans\u2019 inaction in 2016 is reason to approach the 2020 nomination the same way. And she notes the timing is different being closer to the election.\nThe timing and precedent can factor in to how voters view her position now. But it doesn\u2019t change the simple fact that her position changed.\u00a0\nBaldwin asserted in 2016 that presidents are elected \"to a full four-year term,\" and that certainly applies to Trump as it did to Obama. And she said in 2016 \u2014 without any reference to timing \u2014 that the Senate \"has the responsibility to give that nominee fair consideration with a hearing and a vote.\"\u00a0\nWe rate this a Full Flop.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18987"}
