Scott Walker is a contender for president largely because of the collective bargaining reforms -- affecting teachers and most other public employees -- that he signed into law following massive protests in Madison.\nOn June 2, 2015, at a Florida gathering of announced and likely Republican candidates for the White House, Walker credited the March 2011 law for what he said was Wisconsin's improved ranking on the ACT college preparation test.\n\"A lot of protesters at the time claimed that public education was going to fail,\" Walker said, then went on to list changes made by what is known as Act 10.\n\"I\u2019m proud to tell you that today, we no longer have seniority or tenure. That means we can hire and fire based on merit, we can pay based on performance. That means we can put the best and the brightest in our classrooms and we can pay them to be there.\n\"I said the proof is in the pudding; the facts don\u2019t lie. Four years later, graduation rates are up, third-grade reading scores are up, ACT scores are now second-best in the country for states where more than half the kids take the exam.\"\nSaying Wisconsin's ACT scores are now second-best suggests Wisconsin's ranking on the test has improved since Act 10 and that the law played a role.\nLet's see.\nWhere we've been\nTwo previous fact checks help set the table for evaluating Walker's claim.\n1. In February 2011, with the protests being carried out daily, the Wisconsin Democratic Party claimed that the five states that outlaw collective bargaining for teachers all ranked below 44th in the nation in test scores, while Wisconsin ranked second. PolitiFact National rated the claim False, partly because the data cited for both major college preparation tests -- the ACT and the SAT -- was a decade old.\nMore importantly, in terms of evaluating Walker's claim, our colleagues concluded after talking with experts that \"it\u2019s impossible to know whether collective bargaining has any role in causing test scores to rise. That\u2019s because countless other demographic, economic and cultural factors play a role in shaping a state\u2019s test scores.\"\n2. In June 2014, we rated Mostly True a Walker claim that graduation rates and third-grade reading scores in Wisconsin were higher than when he took office in January 2011. Both numbers were up compared with the year before Walker took office. But we found that some credit may be owed to prior elected officials, because the trend lines hadn\u2019t really changed much going back deeper into the pre-Walker era.\nWe also noted in that item that Wisconsin students\u2019 longstanding high-achievement scores on the ACT are well known.\nBut let's flesh them out.\nHere are Wisconsin\u2019s average composite scores on the ACT, and where Wisconsin ranked among the states where more than half the students take the exam. Those are the ones Walker specifically cited in making the claim. We took a look at the three years before and the three years after 2011, when Act 10 was adopted.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\n\n\nScore\n\n\nRank\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2008\n\n\n22.3\n\n\n3rd -- behind Minnesota and Iowa\n\n\n\n\n2009\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.3\n\n\n3rd -- behind Minnesota and Iowa\n\n\n\n\n2010\n\n\n22.2\n\n\n3rd -- tied with Nebraska -- behind Minnesota and Iowa\n\n\n\n\n2011 (Act 10 OK\u2019d in March)\n\n\n22.2\n\n\n3rd -- behind Minnesota and Iowa\n\n\n\n\n2012\n\n\n22.1\n\n\n2nd -- tied with Iowa -- behind Minnesota\n\n\n\n\n2013\n\n\n22.1\n\n\n2nd -- tied with Iowa -- behind Minnesota\n\n\n\n\n2014\n\n\n22.2\n\n\n2nd -- behind Minnesota\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, Wisconsin's rank moved from third to second in 2012, the year after Act 10 was adopted, and has remained there.\nBut that's not because Wisconsin's long-stable composite score has improved. Indeed, the score is virtually unchanged since Act 10.\nMoreover, as we noted previously, there is no evidence to show how any one factor affects ACT scores -- particularly an indirect factor such as a personnel policy like Act 10.\nMatthew Di Carlo, senior research fellow at the Albert Shanker Institute, which studies education policy, reiterated that it would be \"enormously complicated\" to determine how any one factor \u00a0such as socioeconomic status affects ACT scores. That's all the more true for changes in collective bargaining -- a policy that affects personnel rather than one, such as tutoring, that directly affects student learning, he said.\nAnd while Act 10 could have some indirect effects on ACT scores -- such as through the retention of teachers -- those effects couldn't be gauged for some period of years, Di Carlo said.\nOur rating\nWalker said that four years after his collective bargaining law took effect, ACT scores in Wisconsin \"are now second-best in the country for states where more than half the kids take the exam.\"\nThere is an element of truth in Walker\u2019s statement, in that Wisconsin's rank moved from third to second in 2012, the year after the Act 10 collective bargaining reforms were adopted. But the rank didn\u2019t improve because of an improvement in Wisconsin\u2019s score. And there is no evidence that Act 10 affected the ranking.\nFor a statement that has an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate the claim Mostly False.\n\u00a0\nMore on Scott Walker\nFor profiles and stories on Scott Walker and 2016 presidential politics, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's Scott Walker page.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06321"}
