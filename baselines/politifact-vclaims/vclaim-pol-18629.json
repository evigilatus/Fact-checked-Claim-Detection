But a recent Facebook post acknowledging the occasion repeats an unfounded conspiracy theory about Clinton and her allies.\n\"Tomorrow is the four year anniversary of the release of the Podesta E-Mails which revealed that Hillary Clinton & pals are involved in sex trafficking children,\" the Oct. 6 post says.\u00a0\nIt was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nThere is no evidence to support the allegation that Clinton and Podesta were involved in sex-trafficking children, or that there\u2019s a child sex-trafficking ring.\u00a0\nThe claim stems from an email exchange about a fundraiser at Comet Ping Pong pizzeria in Washington, D.C., in September 2008, when Barack Obama was seeking the presidential nomination. People started to peddle the baseless idea that Podesta\u2019s use of the word \"pizza\" was code for pedophilia, and that Comet Ping Pong had secret rooms where Clinton and confidantes kidnapped and imprisoned children to be sexually abused, tortured, or sacrificed for Satan. Believers started to refer to the conspiracy theory as Pizzagate.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn November 2016, BuzzFeed News published a story investigating how the theory spread. Its origins don\u2019t inspire much confidence: a random Twitter account and an anonymous user in the online forum 4chan claimed that police sources said the Clintons were about to be brought down massive sex trafficking scandal. A conspiracy theorist who piggybacked on these claims and said evidence of a \"pedophile sex ring\" had emerged.\nThe theory has spawned other misinformation. We\u2019ve looked into claims that the FBI confirmed evidence of a \"huge underground Clinton sex network,\" that Clinton was on trial for allegedly torturing and killing a 10-year-old girl on camera, that an explosion in Beirut over the summer was linked to human trafficking by Clinton \u2014\u00a0they\u2019re all false.\u00a0\nFour years since Pizzagate became a well-known word, there is still not evidence to back up the idea that Clinton is sex-trafficking children.\u00a0\nWe rate this post Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18629"}
