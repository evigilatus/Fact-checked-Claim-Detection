Tim Kaine had an old prediction tossed back at him during a debate this summer.\nIt was thrown by moderator Judy Woodruff, the anchor and managing editor of PBS NewsHour. She reminded Kaine that in 2016, when he was the Democratic nominee for vice president, he said the election of then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump \"would be a disaster for the economy.\"\nWoodruff asked Kaine to square that with the strong economic results during the first 18 months of the Trump administration: about 3 million new jobs, the unemployment rate dipping below 4 percent, and \"soaring\" corporate profits.\nKaine replied, \"The national economy was strong, in its longest expansion in private sector jobs, before President Trump came into office.\"\nWe fact-checked Kaine\u2019s claim that Trump, when he became president on Jan. 20, 2017, inherited the nation\u2019s longest expansion of private jobs.\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics keeps monthly records on private sector employment back to 1939. They show that the U.S. experienced 82 months straight months of private sector job growth before Trump became president - from March 2010 through December 2016, when Barack Obama was in the White House. That easily qualifies for the longest streak during the eight decades the BLS had been keeping the statistics prior to Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Boysko\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in a committee debate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe United States is the only industrialized, modernized country that does not already have a paid family medical leave program in place.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe streak is still alive under Trump and - through August 2018, the latest statistics are available - is up to 112 months.\nThe second longest streak was 64 months. It ran from May 1995 through October 2000, when Bill Clinton was president. The longest continuous drop in private employment lasted 22 months - from January 2008 through October 2009 during the Great Recession. That was during the last year of George W. Bush\u2019s administration and the first year of Obama\u2019s.\nPresidents from both political parties traditionally have been quick to claim the credit for good economies and fast to dodge the blame when times turn bad. Economists have repeatedly told us it\u2019s mostly a political dance; that the policies of presidents and \u00a0governors don\u2019t drive economic ups and downs.\nOur ruling\nKaine said, \"The national economy was strong in its largest expansion of private sector jobs before President Trump came into office.\" Data shows he\u2019s right.\nWe rate his statement True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01570"}
