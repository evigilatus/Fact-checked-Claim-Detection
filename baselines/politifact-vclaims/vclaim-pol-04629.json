Another 14 million people have left the workforce entirely. Household incomes are down more than $4,000 since the year 2000. That\u2019s 16 years ago.\"\nHere, we\u2019ll focus on the final part of that statement -- that household incomes are down more than $4,000 since the year 2000.\nOn the numbers, Trump is right. Once you adjust for inflation, median household income fell from $57,724 in 2000 to $53,657 in 2014, the last full year for which data is available. That\u2019s a decline of $4,067 -- in line with what Trump said.\nThis chart shows the trend since 2000.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting one bit of context.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile this statistic came amid a series of shots at President Barack Obama, the majority of the period Trump was referring to came under the presidency of George W. Bush, a Republican.\nDuring the first eight years of the span Trump referred to -- 2000 to 2008 -- Bush was president. And during Bush\u2019s tenure, inflation-adjusted median household income declined by $2,411, which is more than half the total amount it fell between 2000 and 2014.\nSince Obama took office, it has fallen by $1,656. That\u2019s not a great legacy, but it\u2019s worth remembering that slicing the numbers this way puts all of the Great Recession on Obama\u2019s watch while also denying Obama 2015, when there was a slow but steady recovery, because data is not available.\nOur ruling\nTrump said, \"Household incomes are down more than $4,000 since the year 2000.\"\nHe\u2019s right on the number. However, for a statistic embedded in a series of attacks on Obama, it exaggerates the income trend under the current president. A majority of the decline in real household income since 2000 actually occurred under a Republican president.\nThe statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/dd9bd01f-4542-406b-b87e-313c218b1da3", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04629"}
