In fact she boasts \u2018deal me in.\u2019 Well, Mrs. Clinton, consider yourself dealt in because as a senator you paid women less than the men in your office,\" said Day at the Republican convention July 19.\nThe gender pay gap is a frequent talking point -- sometimes botched -- by Democrats. So Day, a prominent Republican woman, is calling out the Democratic Party\u2019s own here for the alleged sin of unequal pay. We could not reach Day Tuesday night.\nGender pay gap?\nIn 2015, we fact-checked a claim by Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity that as a senator, Hillary Clinton \"actually paid female staffers a lot less than men.\" We rated that claim Mostly False.\nHannity\u2019s statement followed a Washington Free Beacon story that stated Clinton paid her female Senate staffers 72 cents for every dollar earned by a male counterpart.\nThe article examined data from Senate expenditure reports from 2002-08 posted by LegiStorm Pro, a company that posts information about congressional staff including salary data.\nThe website warns users about extrapolating exact salary information because earnings fluctuate depending on bonuses and leaves of absence.\nThe data focused on full-time staffers who worked a complete fiscal year, Oct. 1-Sept. 30. Clinton was sworn in as New York\u2019s junior senator in January 2001, so the Free Beacon analysis does not include her first nine months in office.\nThe Free Beacon analysis also excludes Senate employees who took leaves of absence, which is common for employees who leave for short periods to work on campaigns, or left after even 11 months of work within the fiscal year.\nRegardless, the Free Beacon concluded the median salary for a woman on Clinton\u2019s payroll was about $15,700 less than the median salary for the men of the office, or about $40,800 compared to $56,500 for men.\n\"The salaries speak for themselves,\" the story says. \"The data shows that women in her office were paid 72 cents for every dollar paid to men.\"\nClinton campaign responds\nBuzzfeed reached a different conclusion in 2015 in a story headlined, \"Internal Data: Hillary Clinton Paid Women And Men Equally.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Boysko\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in a committee debate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe United States is the only industrialized, modernized country that does not already have a paid family medical leave program in place.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe story was based on 2015 salary data for full-time staffers who worked in the Senate office, plus what they earned if they worked for a congressional committee or political groups Friends of Hillary, Hill PAC, and Hillary Clinton for President between 2002-08.\nThe data show a median salary of $40,000 for both men and women receiving official Senate pay over those seven years (excluding Clinton\u2019s pay, since all senators have the same salary set by law.) The median salary remains equal if you factor in non-Senate work, too.\nThe campaign argued this is a better picture of a staffer\u2019s annual earnings, as some staffers took time away from official duties to work for Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign efforts in 2007 and 2008. Huma Abedin, for example, earned $20,000 in 2008 as a senior adviser on Clinton\u2019s Senate staff, but she also made $150,000 working on the campaign that year.\n\"The Free Beacon based their analysis on an incomplete, and therefore, inaccurate set of numbers,\" Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin told PolitiFact in 2015. \"The fact is, Hillary Clinton paid full-time men and women equally.\"\nIf you isolate the data from year to year, the median earnings between men and women were not so even. In 2002, female Senate staffers (excluding Clinton) earned a median of $33,000, while men earned $42,500. The median pay gap closed in 2005 to $41,000 for women and $43,000 for men, and then women exceeded the men\u2019s pay in 2006 and 2007.\nOne caveat: there were more women working for Clinton overall than men in every year.\nBut neither set of data fully answers whether Clinton paid men and women equally because it doesn\u2019t compare wages for \u00a0men and women who do the same work.\nNorman Ornstein, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, previously told PolitiFact it\u2019s common for Senate staffers to temporarily leave payrolls to volunteer or work for campaigns and political committees. So he favors the Clinton campaign\u2019s approach.\nMaking apples-to-apples comparisons is difficult, he said, \"but it is clear that the Free Beacon approach did not take into account the reality that people move in and out of payrolls on a fairly regular basis.\"\nOur ruling\nDay said that as a senator Clinton \"paid women less than the men in your office.\"\nThe data used by Free Beacon showed that the median salary for a woman on Clinton\u2019s payroll was about $15,700 less than the median salary for the men of the office. But this data has several caveats, including that it omits leaves of absences, which are common for staffers to work on campaigns. The data also didn\u2019t contain Clinton\u2019s first nine months in office or staffers who left after less than a year.\nA BuzzFeed analysis relied on more complete data and found the same median salary for men and women.\nBut neither set of data fully answers the question about whether Clinton paid women and men the same amount for the same work.\nWe rate this claim Mostly False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/449f9174-ab3c-4fa3-9013-229ef2c3af7f", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04665"}
