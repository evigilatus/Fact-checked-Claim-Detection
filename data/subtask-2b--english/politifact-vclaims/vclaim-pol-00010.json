And I don\u2019t get any credit for this, but that\u2019s okay. I never do. But here we are. I wrote a book \u2014 a, really, very successful book. And in that book, about a year before the World Trade Center was blown up, I said, \u2018There is somebody named Osama bin Laden. You better kill him or take him out.\u2019 Something to that effect. \u2018He\u2019s big trouble.\u2019\"\nTrump continued, saying that he said to people, \"Take out Osama bin Laden,\" although \"nobody ever heard of Osama bin Laden until, really, the World Trade Center.\n\"But about a year \u2014 you\u2019ll have to check \u2014 a year, year and a half before the World Trade Center came down, the book came out. I was talking about Osama bin Laden. I said, \u2018You have to kill him. You have to take him out.\u2019 Nobody listened to me.\"\nTrump made a similar statement in a speech as a presidential candidate in Virginia in 2015. We rated that statement Mostly False. At other speeches in 2015, Trump went further and said he \"predicted\" bin Laden and terrorism.\nTrump did write about bin Laden critically in his book, but he did not suggest that he be taken out.\nWhat Trump actually wrote about bin Laden\nBin Laden is mentioned once in the book, specifically in a passage criticizing President Bill Clinton\u2019s approach to national security:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Instead of one looming crisis hanging over us, we face a bewildering series of smaller crises, flash points, stand offs, and hot spots. We\u2019re not playing the chess game to end all chess games anymore. We\u2019re playing tournament chess - one master against many rivals. One day we\u2019re assured that Iraq is under control, the UN inspectors have done their work, everything\u2019s fine, not to worry. The next day the bombing begins. One day we\u2019re told that a shadowy figure named Osama bin Laden is public enemy number one, and U.S. jet fighters lay waste to his camp in Afghanistan. He escapes back under some rock, and a few news cycles later, it\u2019s on to a new enemy and a new crisis.\" (Emphasis in bold is ours.)\nTrump\u2019s reference to bin Laden relates to the Aug. 20, 1998, U.S. bombing of his camps in Afghanistan and Sudan. Clinton said they were in retaliation for terrorist bombings earlier that month on U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania which killed 224 people, including 12 Americans, and wounding thousands. Clinton said the goal of the U.S. strikes was to \"disrupt bin Laden\u2019s terror network.\"\nTrump devoted a chapter to terrorism and warned broadly that America could be attacked, but he did not call for taking out bin Laden. He wrote that the U.S. \"must prepare for the real possibility that somewhere, sometime, a weapon of mass destruction will be carried into a major American city and detonated.\"\u00a0\nTrump acknowledged that this was not his original thought, noting that ABC-TV\u2019s \"Nightline\" had aired a series of shows about the threat.\u00a0\nIn his comments to the media Oct. 27, Trump also said that \"al-Baghdadi everybody hears because he\u2019s built this monster for a long time. But nobody ever heard of Osama bin Laden until, really, the World Trade Center.\"\u00a0\nThe United States government was aware of bin Laden a few years before the Sept. 11 attacks. The CIA established a unit in 1996, Alec Station, to hunt bin Laden when he was calling for global jihad. The station was disbanded a decade later.\nOur ruling\nTrump said that in his 2000 book \"I was talking about Osama bin Laden. I said, \u2018You have to kill him. You have to take him out.\u2019\"\nTrump inaccurately recounted what he wrote in his own book. The only kernel of truth here is that Trump did write about bin Laden in the context of criticizing President Clinton.\nTrump\u2019s book warned about terrorism, as did others by 2000, but he did not write that bin Laden should be taken out.\nThis statement rates Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00010"}
