This article was referred to as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It was deleted because we were checking if Einstein actually said it, but we found a lot of other places where the picture was shared - in 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2012. It also appeared elsewhere on the Internet and in books, often as a tale challenging Einstein, as a student, his professor. When we looked for a quote on the Internet, we could not find any reliable sources to confirm that Einstein said so.

His cosmic religion and his distant non-religious god are not suited to the agenda of religious believers or the agenda of tribal atheists. As was often the case during his life, he refused and harassed the accepted categories. We offer great physics harm when we go to it to legitimize our faith in God or in his absence.
