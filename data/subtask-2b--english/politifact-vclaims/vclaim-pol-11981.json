I mean, notice -- the only reason the unemployment rate is going down is because \u2026 twice as many people dropped out of the employment pool as the number of jobs were created.\"\n\nWe\u2019re going to check this statement in two parts. In this item, we\u2019ll check the claim that President Barack Obama \"has now spent three years proving that he kills jobs in energy, he kills jobs in manufacturing.\" In a separate item, we\u2019ll check the claim that \"the only reason the unemployment rate is going down is because \u2026 twice as many people dropped out of the employment pool as the number of jobs were created.\"\n\nFor this item, we're focusing on Gingrich\u2019s claim\u2019s about energy and manufacturing jobs.\n\nWe used data showing net changes in jobs -- that is, jobs created minus jobs lost -- rather than just jobs lost (or \"killed\"). We are also interpreting Gingrich\u2019s comment to mean that Obama is the cause for killing existing jobs, not that Obama has prevented theoretical future jobs from materializing.\n\nNow, to the numbers, which are collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. We looked at two time periods -- one between January 2009 and November 2011, which represents the entirety of Obama\u2019s time in office, and the other between January 2010 and November 2011, which covers the period starting one year into his presidency, a point at which one would assume that Obama\u2019s policies have begun to have some impact.\n\nEnergy jobs\n\nFor energy, we found two relevant categories in the BLS data, oil and gas extraction and mining.\n\nDuring the entire Obama presidency, employment in the oil and gas extraction sector grew by 18,800 jobs, or an increase of 11 percent. Over the same period, jobs in mining declined by 9,200, or 4 percent. Combining the two categories, energy jobs grew by 9,600 jobs, or 2 percent.\n\nBeginning one year into Obama\u2019s presidency, oil and gas extraction jobs increased by 27,500, a rise of 18 percent. Mining jobs grew by 14,900, or 8 percent. Combined, the two sectors increased by 42,400 jobs, or 12 percent.\n\nSo over both periods, the energy sector grew in absolute terms -- and if you measure beginning in January 2010, the increase has been quite healthy at 12 percent over two years.\n\nManufacturing jobs\n\nDuring the entire Obama presidency, the number of manufacturing jobs has declined by 795,000, or 6 percent. Since January 2010, though, the number of manufacturing jobs has increased by 299,000, a rise of 2.6 percent over two years.\n\nThe increase since January 2010 is modest -- a bit over 1 percent per year -- and it hasn\u2019t come close to bringing manufacturing employment back up to the level it was when Obama was inaugurated in the midst of a severe recession. Yet the rise in Obama\u2019s second and third year becomes more robust once it\u2019s put into historical context.\n\nIn general, manufacturing employment has declined more or less steadily since the mid-1970s. The last time manufacturing jobs saw such a large and sustained numerical increase was in the early 1990s. So while the increase in years two and three of the Obama presidency is relatively small, it is the best in about two decades.\n\nOne way to illustrate the long-term decline of manufacturing jobs is to look at how the numbers have moved during the past few presidencies. In the list below, we began counting from one year into each president\u2019s tenure through to the end of their term. Using that methodology, here are the numbers of manufacturing jobs gained or lost per year:\n\nBarack Obama: Increase of 157,368 manufacturing jobs per year in office\nGeorge W. Bush: Decrease of 434,143 manufacturing jobs per year in office\nBill Clinton: Increase of 37,143 manufacturing jobs per year in office\nGeorge H.W. Bush: Decrease of 336,000 manufacturing jobs per year in office\nRonald Reagan: Increase of 1,429 manufacturing jobs per year in office\nJimmy Carter: Increase of 15,333 manufacturing jobs per year in office\n\nSo by this measure, manufacturing jobs have actually increased by more under Obama than under any of his recent predecessors.\n\nA final note: It\u2019s PolitiFact\u2019s policy not to focus solely on the accuracy of the numbers in political attacks (or, conversely, efforts to claim political credit) but also to determine whether blame or credit for the results is justified. For job-creation and job-loss claims, we have ruled that politicians\u2019 policies are just one factor in employment levels, making even statistically accurate claims less than True on our Truth-O-Meter.\n\nOur ruling\n\nGingrich is free to argue that environmental regulations, tax policies and the like have prevented \u00a0the energy and manufacturing sectors from creating as many jobs as they otherwise might. But in this case, Ginrgich said that Obama \"has now spent three years proving that he kills jobs in energy, he kills jobs in manufacturing.\" That\u2019s a different standard, one which means that Obama\u2019s policies have destroyed existing jobs on a net basis.\n\nRight off the bat, we need to downgrade Gingrich\u2019s statement due to its allocation of blame. The job market is subject to many factors, not just Obama\u2019s policies, so it\u2019s unfair to lay all of the blame on the president. But even on the numbers, the claim\u2019s accuracy is mixed at best.\n\nCombined, energy extraction jobs have increased in absolute numbers since Obama took office and have risen quite rapidly over the past two years. Meanwhile, manufacturing jobs are down over the course of Obama\u2019s presidency, but they are up during the past two years at the fastest pace in two decades. On balance, we rate Gingrich\u2019s statement Mostly False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/050fd79e-a562-4189-902e-5f16a84d8b04", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11981"}
