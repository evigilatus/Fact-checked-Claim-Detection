Abbott\u2019s list shows 311 accusations of election fraud spanning 2002-12. The 57 investigations we\u2019re checking represent only those cases that were both prosecuted and resolved.\n\nSix of the prosecutions ended in dismissal or acquittal, Strickland told us by telephone, leaving 51 prosecutions that resulted in convictions.\n\nBy our analysis, three-quarters of the cases involved election code violations classified as \"illegal voting\" -- which includes acts such as voting more than once, impersonating a voter or voting despite ineligibility -- and \"method of returning marked ballot,\" often meaning the defendant was accused of having someone else\u2019s ballot.\n\nOnly two cases are described as \"voter impersonation\" on the list. Whether voter impersonation is a standing problem has been a hot button in the state\u2019s legislative debates over proposed voter ID laws in 2005, 2007, 2009 and 2011; Austin American-Statesman news stories say legislators mostly split along party lines, with Democrats claiming impersonation is rare and Republicans claiming the problem is significant. Abbott drew criticism in 2006 for creating a special unit to target voter fraud that by mid-2008 had yielded, according to a May 19, 2008, Associated Press news story, only 26 prosecutions.\n\nLooking at all 57 election fraud prosecutions from 2002 to 2012, we tallied up the resolutions (some had multiple outcomes, when charges were pursued as separate cases):\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSherrod Brown\n\n\nstated on January 8, 2021 in an interview with Ohio reporters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummer \u201cprotesters outside the White House were met with tear gas, rubber bullets, a full militarized response.

For example, if a person is given deferred adjudication in a domestic violence case and then later is charged again with domestic violence, he said, the adjudication counts as the first offense, making the new charge a second offense.\n\nBut a pre-trial diversion is not a conviction, he said. There\u2019s not even necessarily a guilty plea or admission of guilt.\n\n\"Basically, they sat down with the defendant and say, \u2018Here\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen. You agree not to mess up for 12 months and we\u2019ll just dismiss the case.\u2019 So in no common parlance can this be considered a conviction,\" Kepple said. The case can even be expunged from the defendant\u2019s record, he said.\n\n\"There\u2019s no way you can mistake a pre-trial diversion for a conviction, I don\u2019t think.\"\n\nWe also consulted the Texas Criminal Defense Lawyers Association, a group that provides support and education for its members.\n\nLike Kepple, the association\u2019s capital assistance attorney, Rick Wardroup, pointed out via email that the final outcome of a pre-trial diversion or deferred adjudication depends on whether the defendant meets the terms of their probation or supervision.\n\nAbbott spokeswoman Lauren Bean told us by telephone that the attorney general counts pre-trial diversions as a successful outcome for two main reasons: First, although the defendants do not plead guilty, such agreements are made in order to avoid an expected criminal trial, and second, because the defendant receives a punishment.\n\nAfter we shared our findings with her, Bean sent us another bit of backup: a section of Texas local government code on court costs that classes deferred adjudication and pre-trial diversions with convictions.\n\nUniversity of Texas law school assistant professor Jennifer Laurin told us via email that clauses like this in state laws indicate the reverse -- they illustrate that these two outcomes are not normally considered convictions. And Kepple said, \"That section is the definition of \u2018conviction\u2019 for the purpose of collecting fines and fees. But in common parlance, a deferred prosecution and deferred adjudications simply are not criminal convictions.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nAbbott\u2019s statement refers to 50 \"convictions,\" which he might better have termed \"satisfactory results.\"\n\nIt looks to us like 60 percent of his cited \"convictions\" were not convictions.\n\nWe recognize, though, that our analysis presumes that all the non-convicted defendants fulfilled or will fulfill all terms of the agreements they made to avoid going to trial. That may not be so.\n\nOn balance, we rate Abbott\u2019s claim Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11255"}
