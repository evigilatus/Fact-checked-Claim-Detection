We asked about Pratt's campaign where he got these numbers. His spokesman, Brian Gutchstein, has sent us a column by the mathematician at Stanford Keith Devlin University, which studies the International Student Assessment Programme, reading tests, science and mathematics for 15-year-olds every three years beginning in 2000. Most of the 34 member States of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) - an industry group composed mostly of Western European and North American countries - are now participating. Other countries, such as Russia, Indonesia and Brazil, also participate in regional educational systems in China. In 2000, 32 countries participated. This number grew to 65 in 2012, the most recent test year in which results were published. Gutstein referred to a certain quote from the Devlin column: \"In 2006, American students were last in rank, 25 out of 25, in mathematics, and 21 out of 30 in science. The United States has also registered worse countries than those classified outside OECD (which are developing countries) such as Russia, Azerbaijan, Slovenia and Estonia. Only 1 per cent of Americans aged 15 can perform at the highest level, and 27 countries have a higher percentage of children aged 15 who perform at level 6. And 28% of U.S. students seem to have no sports skills at all.\" We remember from checking past facts that American students were usually in the midst of the group's performance in international tests. But let's go a little deeper into the statistics from this column. First, let us look at the United States arrangement, as reported by the National Centre for Educational Statistics: Science 2000: the United States ranked fourteenth among 28 OECD countries and 14 out of 32 countries. 2003: Nineteenth session out of 30 OECD countries, and twenty-second session out of 41 countries in total. 2006: 21 out of 30 OECD countries and 27 out of 57 countries in total. 2009: 17 out of 34 OECD countries, and 23 out of a total of 65 countries. 2012: 20 out of 34 OECD countries and 28 out of 65 countries in total. Check the facts (Kirk Cox) was mentioned on January 13, 2021 in a speech. Virginia ranked lowest third of the states in the management of the COVID-19 vaccine. By Warren Fisk: 20 January 2021 Mathematics 2000: the United States was 18 out of 28 OECD countries and 19 out of 32 countries. 2003: Twenty-fourth session out of 30 OECD countries, and twenty-seventh session out of 41 countries in total. 2006: Twenty-fifth out of 30 OECD countries and thirty-fifth out of 57 countries in total. 2009: 25 out of 34 OECD countries and 31 out of 65 countries in total. 2012: 27 out of 34 OECD countries and 36 out of 65 countries in total. So Devlin was right in the rank of science in 2006, but he underestimated the U.S., where it ranked among its peers in the math degree. The United States was not \"last\" in its computational results that year, and had not in fact classified the \"last dead\" in any PISA test. Also, Pratt and Devlin point to old results. We know from the 2012 results that out of 34 OECD industrialized countries, the United States ranked 27th in math tests and 20th in scientific tests. So the position of the U.S. among its mathematical and science-testing counterparts has increased slightly. In summing up the results of the United States in the latest tests, OECD stated that the degrees of mathematics in the United States were \"less than average\" among the industrialized countries of that organization. The American scientific results, as the group said, were \"near the OECD average.\" Our rule, Pratt, said that the students of the United States are classified \"in the bottom\" in mathematics and science in degrees among industrialized countries. American students didn't fall right into the bottom of the pile. The latest tests show students in the United States arranged near the middle of the group between industrialized countries for degrees of science and in the lower class of mathematics. Performance is not something to celebrate, but Pratt is wrong when he said twice in his statement that U.S. students rank \"down\" advanced countries in math and science. We assess his claim is wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07038"}
