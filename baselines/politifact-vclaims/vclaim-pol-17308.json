Social media users quickly followed suit.\n\"Lin Wood confirms Chief Justice John Roberts was on Epstein\u2019s pedo island, has documentation\" said the headline on one pro-Trump blog post shared widely on Facebook.\n\"John Roberts having fun at Epstein\u2019s island!\" said another Facebook post, which showed a photo of President Bill Clinton with several other men in an ocean. \"He is compromised!\"\nThe posts about Roberts were flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

The picture shows Clinton with four men. It was featured in Spanish-language news reports from the time.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther fact-checkers have debunked the same claim, as well as similarly false claims that said photos from the same trip showed Clinton with Epstein and another convicted sex offender.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not clear who the person social media users identified as Roberts actually is. But as the Dispatch noted, photographs from Trump\u2019s inauguration \u2014 which also took place in January 2017 \u2014 show that Roberts had grayer hair and a bigger bald spot than the man in question.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is sworn in as the 45th president of the United States by Chief Justice John Roberts during the 58th Presidential Inauguration in Washington on Jan. 20, 2017 (AP)\nThe Supreme Court also heard several oral arguments that month, the court\u2019s calendar shows.\nA person by the name of \"John Roberts\" was listed in 2010 and 2011 entries in the handwritten flight logs kept by Epstein\u2019s pilots. But PolitiFact found no credible evidence that the person named is the chief justice, as opposed to another person by the same name.\u00a0\nOther fact-checkers noted that after the logs came out, Fox News White House correspondent John Roberts also denied any connection to Epstein on Twitter.\nPolitiFact searched Google and Nexis and found no credible reports indicating that the chief justice was friends with Epstein. Other fact-checkers reached the same conclusion.
