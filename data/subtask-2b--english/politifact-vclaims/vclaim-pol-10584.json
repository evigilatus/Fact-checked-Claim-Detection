Paul Ryan, R-Wis.\n\nAt one point, she turned the conversation to Romney\u2019s tax returns.\n\nHere\u2019s some of the back and forth between the South Florida congresswoman and Fox News Sunday guest host John Roberts:\n\nWasserman Schultz: \"Barack Obama and Joe Biden have released 12 years of tax returns. Mitt Romney has released one and a partial view of a second one. His own father...\"\n\nRoberts: \"John McCain released two.\"\n\nWasserman Schultz:: \"His own father -- no, John McCain released more than -- released about 12 years of tax returns.\"\n\nRoberts: \"John Kerry didn't release his wife's tax returns. I mean, you can make a lot of arguments what is appropriate in terms of...\"\n\nWasserman Schultz: \"Spouses are not running for president. ... Mitt Romney is the first major party candidate for president of the United States in modern times not to release at least 12 years of tax returns. It's unacceptable.\"\n\nThe subject of Romney\u2019s tax returns and his taxes has generated multiple claims we\u2019ve evaluated on our Truth-O-Meter. Here, we will examine Wasserman Schultz\u2019s claim, \"Romney is the first major party candidate for president of the United States in modern times not to release at least 12 years of tax returns.\"\n\nPolitiFact recently examined a claim by former President Bill Clinton that it\u2019s typical for presidential candidates to release 10 or 11 years of tax returns. We rated that claim Half True, and we will draw from that fact-check.\n\nThere have been several major presidential candidates to release fewer than 12 tax returns:\n\n\u2022 In 2000, George W. Bush provided nine and Al Gore eight.\n\n\u2022 In the 2008 primary, then Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., delivered seven, a move that was matched by Hillary Clinton about a month later.\n\n\u2022 In 1988, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis released six years of returns.\n\u2022 In 2008, McCain released two years of returns, as Roberts said.\n\n\u2022 In 1980, Ronald Reagan offered up just one return.\n\nThere is a difference for incumbents and challengers. Ever since 1976, when Jimmy Carter became president, sitting presidents and vice presidents have released their taxes each year they are in office. By the time re-election rolls around, they have put at least four tax returns into the public record. Challengers generally match or exceed that.\n\nOur colleagues at Factcheck.org looked at this in July and found that since 1980, only two general election candidates have revealed no more than two years of tax returns. One was Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., in 2008 and the other is Romney, who released his 2010 tax return and an estimate of 2011.\n\nWhen we contacted the DNC about this fact-check, they sent us a statement saying Romney should release more of his tax returns. What they didn\u2019t provide was evidence to support Wasserman Schultz\u2019s claim.\n\nOur ruling\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 23, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBiden invested the entire family fortune in Ukraine gas and oil.

And those examples have been highlighted in recent news articles. Wasserman Schultz\u2019s claim is not correct, and we rate the statement False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/b2415e9e-2c2b-402f-8451-cf2041d0e8c8", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10584"}
