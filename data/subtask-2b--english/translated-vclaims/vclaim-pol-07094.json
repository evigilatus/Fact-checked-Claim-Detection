The race between the current Democratic Party (Jeff Merkele) and the Republican (Monica Wehbe) can play a pivotal role in whether Democrats maintain the majority in the Senate. In the period prior to 20 May 2014, the basic rock proved to be more than expected for Wehbe, a new political comer and a neurosurgeon for children, when police reports showing details of domestic incidents involving her ex-husband and ex-boyfriend emerged. :: Prosecution: On the day after the primary stage, the Wehbe campaign published a news release that appeared with a view to re-talking the topic on which I focused for weeks -- health care. \"Jeff Merkelly was the decisive vote on Obamacker.\" The bulletin mentioned, \"The one in Oregon was an unmitigated disaster.\" This is not the first time that a politician has been accused of giving a central voice in favour of a controversial affordable welfare law. However, we considered whether the circumstances surrounding Merkel's vote were different from those of his democratic colleagues. Analysis: Polyte Fact National verified a series of allegations that the various Democrats were \"critical votes.\" For example, in November 2013, the former Attorney-General of Virginia and candidate for governor, Ken Cuchinelli, said that the United States of America, Senn Mark Warner, D-VA, had cast a decisive vote on the Affordable Care Act. In Florida, the prosecution &apos; s announcement about the U.S. Sun Bill Nelson was made, while others reiterated assurances about Sens. Michael Bennett and Mark O'Dall are both Democrats from Colorado. An examination of those cases found that none of the senators voted \"Decciding.\" On January 10, 2021, in an article on Facebook, he said that Nancy Belusi had sent a letter to the mayor of Portland after demonstrations there \"to demand that he stick to the proven book of democratic play.\" By Sira O'Rourke on January 11, 2021, a simple date: the first Senate vote was related to this issue in December 23 2009. There is a need to overcome this problem and to end the debate on the draft law, so that it can be put to a vote for final approval. The rules of the Senate require 60 senators to approve such a proposal. The vote to defeat Philly Buster came on the number, with Merclay voting with the rest of his party. However, his vote was no more vital than any other, especially since his support was not called into question. On the contrary, Mr. Benn Nelson, from the D-Neb company, needed to stagger late, and agreed to support the bill only after 13 hours of negotiations, according to news reports at the time. It was his 60th critical vote. There is a need to vote on two other bills in order for the agreement to be finally approved. The first, which approved the original version of the Affordable Care Act, requires only a simple majority, which is easy to adopt. The following vote was held on 25 March 2010, which formally approved the bill after it was passed by the House of Representatives. Merkele joined another 56 senators, making it impossible to say whether his vote was the one who sent the Alliance to Obama's signing office. We asked Wehbe to defend this claim. In an e-mail, campaign manager Charlie Pierce replied: \"By virtue of Jeff Merkelly's vote of yes on Obama Kerr, the health insurance schemes for 150,000 Oregon were cancelled. If Jeff Merckley had the courage to vote not on this law, Obama Kerr wouldn't have passed, and hundreds of millions of taxpayers wouldn't have lost on the failure that was covering Oregon. Decision: The Wehbe campaign, which won again in the Senate elections, sent a newsletter commenting on the responsibility for approving the law on affordable care to its democratic opponent. He said, \"The one in Oregon was an unmitigated disaster.\" The confirmation is the latest possible recognition of the Democratic Senator as having cast his \"predictive\" vote for Obamakari. All similar cheques found the claim to be either false or often false. The Wehbe campaign, which was requested to defend the prosecution, sent an e-mail that omitted any mention of Merkeli's voice. Her assertion that Merkel's vote resulted in the cancellation of Oregon's 150,000 health care plans is a cheque that we will leave for another day. Merkel joined his democratic colleagues in voting on the bill, but he was a senator from Nebraska who put forward the required 60 votes. We value this allegation wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07094"}
