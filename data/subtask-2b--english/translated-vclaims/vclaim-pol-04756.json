In a keynote address last week, the supposed Republican candidate read out a number of claims from Clinton Cash, the best sell in 2015 in contributions to the Clinton Foundation. Among them: \"The Hillary Clinton Foreign Office approved the transfer of 20% of U.S. holdings from uranium to Russia, while nine investors in the deal transferred $145 million to the Clinton Foundation - $145 million.\" We wanted to verify Clinton's charge of participating in the play-pay policy. The Trump allegation is a reduced version of the findings of its source and goes through several problems. First, the State Department agreed to a gradual takeover by Russia of a company with large uranium assets in the United States, but did not act unilaterally. The State was one of nine government agencies, not to mention independent nuclear regulatory bodies at the federal and state levels, which had to sign the deal. Secondly, while nine people with a relationship with the company have already contributed to the Clinton Foundation, it is unclear whether they are still participating in and benefiting from the company by the time of the Russian transaction. Third, most of their contributions from the Clinton Foundation were made before and during the 2008 Hillary Clinton presidential bidding, before she knew that she would become a Secretary of State. To sum up: While the links between the Clinton Foundation and the Russian deal may seem suspicious, there is simply no evidence of any trade. Was Clinton &apos; s unsubstantiated role to endanger national security alone by lighting up the Russian agreement, as Tramp suggests? No. The company in question, Uranium 1, has mines, mills and land areas in Wyoming, Utah and the other United States equivalent to about 20 per cent of the United States uranium production capacity. A smaller part of the actual uranium produced is produced in the United States (11 per cent in 2014), according to Oilpress.com. But this is less disturbing than Trump suggests. First, the United States does not actually produce much uranium (about 2 per cent in 2015) and is in fact a net importer of the chemical, according to Jeffrey Lewis, an expert in nuclear non-proliferation at the Middlebury Institute and a former director of the New America Foundation. On the other hand, Russia does not have licences for the export of uranium outside the United States, Oilprices.org pointed out, \"So it is a little tricky to say that this uranium is now the property of Russia, and it does what it wants.\" It is likely that the Kremlin was more interested in the origins of the first uranium in Kazakhstan, the world &apos; s largest producer. Trump is also wrong that only Clinton allowed the transfer. The nine members of the United States Foreign Investment Commission had to agree to purchase the Kremlin in 2010 for a controlling share of U1. These included the Secretary of State, Clinton, but also the Treasury (Chairman of the Commission), Defence, Justice, Trade, Energy and Internal Security, as well as the heads of office of the United States Trade Representative and the Office of Science and Technology Policy. The agreement had also to be approved by the Independent Nuclear Regulatory Commission as well as the Utah Nuclear Regulatory Authority. While it was conceivable that Clinton called for this deal, the author of Clinton Cash Peter Schweizer himself admitted that he had no \"direct evidence\" that Clinton played a role. The main representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the Committee, Jos\u00e9 Fern\u00e1ndez, told Time that Clinton \"has never interfered with me on any CFIUS issue.\" Why on earth would the United States allow the transfer of a uranium company? As others have pointed out, including the New York Times investigation, the United States has been seeking to \"re-establish\" relations with Russia and try to get the Kremlin on its Iranian nuclear deal. But ultimately, the Russian deal wasn't that big. Lewis said that Russia's purchase of the company \"had an impact on national security as much as it would have if they had set the money on fire.\" \"Maybe that's why CFIUS and NRC agreed to it.\" An intense temporal suggestion from Trump that the Russian deal happened \"while nine investors delivered $145 million to Clinton Foundation\" is not supported by the evidence presented in Clinton Cash. On the contrary, the contributions made in detail by author Schweizer occurred at least two years before the transaction was concluded. Moreover, it is not clear from the book whether all nine donors to the Clinton Foundation are already involved in the Russian deal at all. The timeline is the key here, so bear with us. The uranium had 1 number of facial upgrades between 2007 and 2013. In 2007, South Africa had mining assets in Africa and Australia. In that spring, it merged with another mining company, Or Asia Energy, based in Canada. The company collectively retained uranium 1 in its name but Toronto maintained its base. Under the terms of the transaction, contributors in Europe retained a 60 per cent share in the new company. Russia intervened only two years later, in June 2009, when its nuclear agency began buying shares in uranium 1. The Kremlin raised its share of the company from 17 per cent to 51 per cent the following year, and acquired full ownership of the company in 2013 (renamed one U.H. Holdings). Of the nine investors on the Clinton Cash list, five were linked only to the Ors of Asia, and Schweizer did not mention whether they were still involved with the company after the merger and when Russia was buying it. (We asked the publicist at Schweizer via e-mail, but we did not hear a reply.) Using the SEDAR system, the Canadian registration system for public companies, we could only verify one of the shareholders in the Ore of Asia (Ean Tilver), who also owned shares in U1 in 2010 and who presided over its board of directors. An investigation in the New York Times on this subject linked two more to uranium one. Why does it matter? Because the investors of Or Asia could've sold their shares before they won the Russian deal. In other words, giving the Clinton Foundation would not have mattered the possession that Clinton allegedly received in 2010 if they had no interest in it. We have created a collapse of the nine \"investors\" and their donations to the Clinton Foundation, based on the most complete information we have found through the Clinton Foundation, \"Investigator\" is the year of the call, Frank Giustra* Foundation of Or Asia Energy, $131.3 million late 2005 and June 2007 By Samantha Buterman, January 11, 2012, Frank Holmes, Executive Director of the United States. 1. Global investors, who had uranium 1, shared between $250,000 and $500,000 in March 2008, a uranium consultant $1,500,000 at the Robert Despereux Stock Exchange at Haywood Securities Company, which, according to Clinton Cash, provided $58 million in the capital of Or Asia-Oranium 1, $1 million to $5 million in 2007, Paul Reynolds* Financial adviser in the Or Asia-Oranium merger of $1 million to $5 million in March 2008, Robert Cross Or Asia Contributor and Managing Director $500,000 in March 2008, Egicio Pianchini Como Global Metal and Mining Group, a writer under Or Asia-Oranium 1 Merger 600,000 in March 2008, and Sergei Corzin Or Asia holding $1 million in March 2008, Ian Teler**Oranium 1 President $3 million March 2008, a total of $139.15 million to $146.9 million* As you can see in the chart, voluntary contributions of $145 million did not occur \"while\" the Russian deal was in 2010. According to Clinton Cash, five donors contributed $136.4 million to a benefit hosted by Gwistera in March 2008 or earlier. While the book does not specify when the other four will contribute to the Clinton Foundation, we were able to track a further $2.6 million for fund-raising in March. Moreover, most of the $145 million comes from Frank Giustra, founder of the Or Asia Energy Corporation and a major donor of the Clinton Foundation. Gestra says he sold all his shares of uranium 1 in autumn 2007, \"at least 18 months before Hillary Clinton became Foreign Minister\" and three years before the Russian deal. We have not been able to independently verify the claim of geostera from the open files of Ore Asia or Uranium 1. On the assumption that Gyustra is telling the truth, the sure amount of uranium 1 donation falls from more than $145 million to just $4 million. All of this happened before Russia's deal. One caution: The New York Times found that Ian was making a donation of between $1.3 million and $5.6 million to the Clinton Foundation during and after the review process of the Russian deal. There is therefore evidence that one man involved in one Uriunium (television) donated millions to the Clinton Foundation at the same time as the agreement was made. This certainly does not sound good for Hillary Clinton, but it is far from nine investors looting $145 million. Our Governor Trump said: \"The Hillary Clinton State Department has agreed to transfer 20% of the U.S. holdings of uranium to Russia, while nine investors in the deal have transferred $145 million to the Clinton Foundation. There is a portion of the right to this claim. The Clinton State Department was one of nine government agencies to approve Russia's acquisition of a company with uranium assets in the United States. Nine people called the company at one time and donated it to Clinton, but we only found evidence that someone did it \"while\" the Russian deal was happening. The bulk of the $145 million in donations came two years before the deal. Trump certainly has the right to question the indisputable links between Clinton Foundation donors and their uranium-1 ties, but Trump's charge is excessive. More importantly, his proposal to trade was not based on any evidence, as the author of Clinton Cash himself admitted. At the basic level, the schedule of Tramp is broken. Most of the donations occurred before Clinton was named Secretary of State. We appreciate Trump's claim that it is often false. Correction: An earlier version of this story misreads the name of the State Department representative of the United States Foreign Investment Commission. It's Jos\u00e9 Fern\u00e1ndez.
