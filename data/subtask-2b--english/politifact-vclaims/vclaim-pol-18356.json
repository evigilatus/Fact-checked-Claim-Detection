In Illinois, a prominent state politician suggested the same thing:\n\"This man-made killer \u2014 whoever went in there and man-made it, perhaps they should be in there now trying to figure out how to turn this around,\" Illinois Senate Majority Leader Kimberly Lightford of Maywood said during a May 15 appearance on Fox 32.\n\"I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s a natural virus,\" Lightford continued, after the program\u2019s host asked Lightford if she thinks the virus did not occur naturally. \"I believe someone was in cahoots for some reason and I think it just got a little bit out of control and spread a whole lot further than they anticipated.\"\nBut to leading experts, the research is clear: the genetic structure of the virus shows it could not have been created in a lab \u2014 or be \"man-made,\" as Lightford claimed.\nAn article published March 17 in Nature Medicine says the genetic makeup of the coronavirus does not indicate it was altered. Instead, the researchers who conducted the analysis present two plausible explanations for the origin of the virus: natural selection in an animal host, or natural selection in humans after the virus spread from animals.\nThat finding doesn\u2019t rule out the much-publicized theory the virus may have somehow escaped from a lab in China where it was being studied, though the government there has denied this. But what is known makes it clear the virus itself is not the result of human tampering.\n\"Our analyses clearly show that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus,\" the article states, using the scientific name for the virus that causes COVID-19.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperts from a number of different research and public health institutions, including the World Health Organization, say the most likely explanation for the virus is that it originated in animals.\nU.S. intelligence officials and Dr. Anthony Fauci, who directs the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, have also said the science indicates the virus was not made in a lab.\nWhen we reached out to Lightford, she acknowledged she had no evidence to support her assertion the virus was created by humans.\n\"I have nothing to back it up,\" she wrote in a text in response to our call. \"I was generally speaking. Only my opinion.\"\nOur ruling\nLightford said the novel coronavirus was \"man-made.\"\nBut research shows the genetic features of the virus rule out the possibility it was created or manipulated in a lab. The consensus among experts is that it originated in animals before being transmitted to humans.\nWe rate her claim False.\n\nFALSE \u2014 The statement is not accurate.\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18356"}
