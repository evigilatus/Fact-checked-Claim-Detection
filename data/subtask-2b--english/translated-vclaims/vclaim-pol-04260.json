In the presidential debate held on 26 September in Hempstead, N.Y., Director Lester Holt presented Trump as \"support for the war in Iraq prior to the invasion.\" \"I didn't support the war in Iraq,\" he said, Holt County. \"The record shows I'm right.\" The challenge of Tramp's claim is that we can't go back in time to his mind, so we'll never know what his own ideas are. But there is one thing that is clear: the record does not prove that it is right. Trump has a problem crossing an interview in September 2002 with Howard Stern. Stern asked Trump if he supported the imminent invasion. Trump answered: \"Yeah, I think so.\" In the discussion, Trump said that he made these comments to Stern \"very kindly.\" Trump then observed another interview in January 2003, a few months before the invasion. Neil Cafoto of Fox News Trump asked whether President George W. Bush should be more focused on Iraq or the economy. \"Well, he's either doing something or not doing something, maybe, because maybe he shouldn't have done it yet and maybe we should be waiting for the United Nations, you know,\" said Trump. \"He's under a lot of pressure. I think he's doing a pretty good job. But, of course, if you look at polls, a lot of people get a little tired. I believe that the Iraqi situation is a problem. I think the economy is a much bigger problem as far as the President is concerned.\" So Trump put the economy before Iraq, but he didn't talk against going to war. He suggested, at the most, waiting for the United Nations to do something. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u25cf January 11, 2012, a week after the United States invasion of Iraq on March 19, 2003, Trump gave a different response. At the Academy Awards after the party, Trump said that \"war is a mess,\" according to the Washington Post. Tell Fox News that because of the war, \"the market will rise like a rocket.\" Throughout 2003, Trump complained about the cost of Iraq's war and its impact on the economy. The first evidence of Trump's express opposition to the war was only given in an article in August 2004 in Esquire, more than a year after the war began: \"Look at the war in Iraq and the chaos in which we are. I wouldn't have handled it that way. Trump has challenged many times in these elections to explain his early acceptance of the war. In an interview with NBC in February 2016 about the press meeting, Trump said that he did not know what he meant during his conversation with Stern in 2002. \"That was a long time ago, and who knows what was in my head.\" Trump said. In the debate on 26 September, Trump also stated that he had had numerous discussions with the Fox host and Tramp's supporter, Sean Hannetti, before the invasion of Iraq - where Trump opposed the invasion and was supported by Hannity. However, they didn't have these discussions on the air, so we don't have a record of them. Huntie said that's a \"per cent right.\" The Governor Trump said, \"I didn't support the war in Iraq... the record shows I'm right.\" The Register does not support Trump &apos; s repeated assertions that he opposed the war before the 2003 invasion. At the time of the invasion, Trump's comments were few and far apart, let alone vague. In 2002, he asked if America should go to war, and he said, \"I think so.\" Less than three months before the invasion, Trump said the President should be more focused on the economy, but he did not speak specifically against an attack. It was only about a year and a half after the invasion that full opposition was expressed. We value this allegation wrong. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/0df-209e7-b481-4213-bfb7-55b13ceb3a1", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04260"}
