His case in point: Anderson Mill Road.\nFlannigan has repeatedly said at candidate forums and in interviews that he and his Northwest Austin Coalition deserve the credit for persuading Mayor Steve Adler to put $5.5 million for the notoriously traffic-jammed Anderson Mill Road in Austin\u2019s proposed $720 million transportation bond. It\u2019s one of more than 30 projects listed by name in the Nov. 8, 2016, ballot proposition.\nFlannigan told the online Austin Monitor, which focuses on local government news: \"Anderson Mill Road was included in Mayor Adler\u2019s transportation bond explicitly because of the work we did with the Northwest Austin Coalition.\"\nMonitor publisher Michael Kanin pressed during their exchange, posted Sept. 12, 2016 and later cited in an Oct. 21, 2016, Zimmerman press release: \"Just to be crystal clear here, it was the mayor's office that told you it was because of your work...\"\nFlannigan: \"Yes.\"\nKanin: \"...And not (the work of) council member (Don) Zimmerman.\"\nFlannigan: \"Yes.\"\nFlannigan made nearly identical claims at a Sept. 15, 2016, candidate forum organized by the City of Austin and the Austin-area League of Women Voters and a forum hosted a week later by the West Austin Chamber of Commerce.\nAt those forums and in his Oct. 21 press release, Zimmerman called Flannigan\u2019s assertions a lie. Zimmerman noted that he held a 2015 town hall meeting, attended by Flannigan and Adler, in which city staffers talked about potential solutions for Anderson Mill Road. Zimmerman\u2019s statement also pointed out he proposed redirecting $2.2 million in transportation funding in August 2015 to study fixes for the road; that pitch did not draw council support.\nZimmerman\u2019s 2016 press release said: \"Everyone in District 6 knows that Anderson Mill Road is a key artery that needs to be improved. Multiple groups have been working on fixing Anderson Mill Road.\"\nBuilding the bond\nSo, how did various clogged roads end up in the proposed $720 million transportation bond?\nAdler, who first floated the idea of a big transportation bond plan in late 2015, took the lead on crafting the proposal. Three memos provided by Adler\u2019s office and the city\u2019s capital projects office offer insight. It looks to us like much of the ballot proposal drew from a June 13, 2016, Austin Transportation Department memo listing long-sought overhauls on seven major roads such as East Riverside Drive, North Lamar Boulevard and South Lamar Boulevard, in which engineering work was complete or underway. That memo also listed other critical stretches of roads, such as Anderson Mill Road between RM 620 and Parmer Lane.\nA second staff memo -- sent to Adler and the council on June 16, 2016 -- estimated it would cost $5.5 million to expand and improve a shorter stretch of Anderson Mill Road, between RM 620 and U.S. 183. The same day, Adler included the $5.5 million for Anderson Mill Road in his first public draft of possible bond projects.\nFive days later, city staff distributed a third memo, which also included Anderson Mill Road and estimated the size and scope of the work that could be done for different bond amounts. For example, that memo shows a $250 million bond would not include work on Anderson Mill Road, while a $720 million bond package would.\nCredit from the mayor?\nIn the September\u00a0Monitor interview, Flannigan said the \"mayor\u2019s office told\" him that it was his work that got Anderson Mill in the bond.\nJust after the Monitor published the interview, though, Adler emailed his staff, asking: \"Has anyone in our office made such a statement? Should someone call Jimmy and find out why he said that?\"\nZimmerman\u2019s campaign initially provided a copy of that email, which we independently obtained and verified.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 23, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBiden invested the entire family fortune in Ukraine gas and oil. Then shuts down Keystone pipeline. Starting to get the picture.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy phone, Adler staff adviser John-Michael Cortez offered a different description of Flannigan\u2019s role in getting Anderson Mill added to the bond. Cortez recalled Flannigan as \"one of many people who highlighted specific (transportation) improvements in Northwest Austin.\"\nWhile Cortez said that he met with Flannigan and his group before the bond\u2019s summer 2016 rollout, he added that Flannigan \"not the only one who highlighted it as an important improvement.\"\nCortez added: \"I doubt I ever said it was because of his efforts, but his efforts certainly were helpful in making that project a priority.\"\nIn an October 2016 phone interview with us, Adler took the same line. \"These are conversations that have been going on in that community for years. Everyone was aware those conversations were going on,\" Adler said. \"They were conversations that I heard when I was campaigning two years ago.\"\nFlannigan subsequently stood by his earlier statement that the mayor\u2019s office had credited him with getting Anderson Mill into the bond. Asked to identify who in Adler\u2019s office told him so, Flannigan didn\u2019t say. By email, he responded: \"At no point was I told that others had asked for the road to be included.\"\nCorridor study\nFlannigan has touted a \"citizen-led\" corridor study as one of the ways the Northwest Austin Coalition, which he founded, pushed to include Anderson Mill improvements in the bond. \"When I brought that study to city staff and the mayor\u2019s office, they got the road included in the bond,\" Flannigan said at the League of Women Voters forum. \"That is a fact.\"\nA corridor study would be hard to miss. The typically binder-sized reports are full of painstaking schematics, diagrams and traffic projections that lay out proposed improvements and the effects they\u2019ll have on neighborhoods and businesses. As an example, the December 2013 corridor study for East Riverside Drive runs 277 pages.\nWhen we inquired about an Anderson Mill corridor study, though, Adler spokesman Jason Stanford and a transportation department spokeswoman, Marissa Monroy, each said by phone that city files didn\u2019t show any study submitted by Flannigan\u2019s group.\nWhen we emailed Flannigan\u2019s campaign to ask for a copy, his campaign manager, Allison Heinrich, provided a link to an interactive map on the Northwest Austin Coalition\u2019s website, where users could post complaints about the road.\nBy email, Flannigan later acknowledged he hadn\u2019t submitted the complaints or users\u2019 suggestions to City Hall. \"Since everything was public and online, it didn't require being sent,\" he wrote, \"it was part of the public conversation.\"\nA city survey\nFlannigan also cited his group\u2019s efforts to press for Anderson Mill improvements through the city\u2019s 2015 transportation survey, MobilityATX, which asked residents for opinions on transportation needs online and during in-person public meetings.\nThe top recommendation from the 1,039 Austinites who participated in the nonscientific MobilityATX survey: Building out the city's bike lane network, followed by burying Interstate 35 through downtown and expanding dedicated bus lanes. Tied for fourth, with 112 votes: Improving Anderson Mill Road between U.S. 183 and FM 620 and encouraging developers to build denser housing in central city neighborhoods.\nCortez, Adler\u2019s aide, suggested that Flannigan overplayed the importance of the 2015 survey to what made it into the bond package. \"I think generally it played the role of getting people interested and excited about making some progress about our mobility challenges,\" Cortez said. \"It just daylighted some priorities that some interested stakeholders had.\"\nOur ruling\nFlannigan said he\u2019s responsible for Anderson Mill Road being part of the city\u2019s proposed transportation bond issue.\nNo doubt, Flannigan\u00a0advocated for improvements to the road to be part of the 2016 bond proposal lately before Austin voters. Then again, Flannigan didn\u2019t provide nor did we find independent indications that he himself caused the road to land on the ballot.\nWe rate this claim Mostly False.\n\nMOSTLY FALSE \u2013 The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.
