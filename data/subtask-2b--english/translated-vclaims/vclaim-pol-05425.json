In fact, I've heard 42% lately.\" In fact, Trump is the one who shouldn't be believed. The high numbers are not even close to accuracy. To understand why, let's start by discussing how to calculate the official unemployment rate. The Bureau of Labour Statistics, a federal agency, uses surveys and statistical sampling to calculate the number of Americans who are or are not employed. In order to calculate the unemployment rate, the Agency divides the number of unemployed persons (which includes only those who have recently sought employment) among the total population seeking employment and workers. During the last month - January 2016 - the unemployment rate was 4.9 per cent, the lowest since February 2008. However, persons who are not currently looking for work have not been taken into account in this calculation. This is a long-term concern for economists, because at least some of these people who are not looking for a job now may prefer to look for a job but do not feel like they have an opportunity in the current labour market. To alleviate these concerns, the Office also produces statistics with a more extensive definition of what it calls \"unemployed labour.\" This stat is known as \"U-6.\" The U-6 rate includes both those who are officially \"unemployed\" and those who work part-time for economic reasons and those who are \"frequently associated\" with the labour force, which means that they want to work but have not sought employment recently enough to be considered active in the labour force. The unemployment rate currently stands at 9.9 per cent, double the official unemployment rate. However, this is also its lowest level since May 2008. It can be said that the U-6 rate provides a more equitable way of wrapping up the image of unemployment; some ordinary economists sympathize with this argument. But where Trump goes off the rails, he suggests that the \"real\" unemployment rate is somewhere between 28% and 42%. Why? It includes a ton of Americans who don't expect to work. Let us explore this point further. The 42 percent Trump number appears to be a column painted by David Stockman, who was President Ronald Reagan's budget manager. Stockman calculated that there are currently 210 million Americans between the ages of 16 and 68 -- what he calls an \"impossible measure of potential workforce.\" If I assume that each of these people is able to maintain a full-time job, he writes, they will offer a total of 420 billion potential work hours. However, during 2014, Stockman noted that the Bureau of Labour Statistics had recorded only 240 billion hours of work. If you run the numbers, \"The real unemployment rate was 42.9%,\" Stockman wrote. The economists say that Stockman's way of looking at the question -- using actual working hours divided by the theoretical maximum that could have worked, rather than determining whether individuals are working or unemployed -- is provocative. But they say that this raw measure has serious flaws. In fact, Stockman admits in his column that this number is incomplete, even though his accent fluctuates when he does. \"Yes, we have to allow unemployed wives, students, disabled, early retirees and coupon scissors,\" books. \"We also have wanderers, crooks, social welfare frauds, bums and people in between jobs, enrolled in training programs, On January 9, 2021, on Twitter, Sarah Goodlowski stated: \"Not all women lost jobs (in December's job report), most of them black and Latin women. In fact, white women got a job. According to Gary Bertellis, an economist at the Brookings Institution, the Stockman account, \"persons voluntarily working part-time hours are treated as partially unemployed, even if they have excellent reasons for wanting to take up a part-time job only, such as raising children, attending school or college, disability, or moving to retirement.\" \"Many of the shortage of full-time and part-time work is entirely reasonable, as is the worker's decision not to work or to seek paid employment at all.\" In other words, Trump's belief in the accuracy of 42 per cent is misplaced. So is there a reasonable account that can get us to 42%? The short answer is no. To figure out why, let's start with 16-year-old Americans who are not working, or (2) unemployed, or (3) in the army, or (4) in institutions. That gives us 94 million Americans \"unemployed.\" We then put forward the number of people who have good reasons for not working or seeking work. \u2022 Persons between the ages of 16 and 19 who are not members of the labour force: subtract 10.8 million persons: persons aged 65 and over who are not members of the labour force: subtract 38.4 million persons; students aged 20-24: subtract 8.7 million; students aged 25 to 29: subtract 2.9 million; students aged 30 to 34: subtract 1.4 million; mothers staying at home: subtract 10.4 million; parents staying at home: subtract 2 million; students receiving disability tests: subtract 8.9 million; what remains? With these calculations, there are 10.5 million Americans who have no clear reasons for not working. If you're going to use these figures to create a new type of unemployment rate -- call it \"U-7\" if you want -- it goes out to 15.6%. This is higher than the U-6 rate of 9.9 per cent, but it is only part of 42 per cent called Trump. This is not a full account. There may be some double counting, and there may be good reasons why some of these 10.5 million Americans are unable to work, such as being a full-time student between the ages of 34 and 65, receiving vocational training, or being rich enough to be able to give up work or early retirement. Some may argue that students should not escape this ease because they should be able to work side by side with their studies, or that we should set a higher age limit for retirement than 65 years. This is solid enough to calculate the envelope to show how inaccurate Trump's claim is. Remember, we deliberately expand the figures here as an intellectual practice; we do not say that 15.6 per cent is a more accurate unemployment rate than the official rate of 4.9 per cent. Bertellis said that the status quo was not even devoid of virtues. Most of those who suffer from \"out-of-work\" of the Trump definition can in fact be seen as benefiting from their membership in a rich and technologically advanced society. The fact that millions of adults are what Trump calls \"without work,\" and he said, \"It's not a sign of economic failure -- it's an indicator of a very prosperous society that can allow the elderly and disabled to retire, which can invest in young adults so that they can improve their skills, which can keep some adults at home where they can take care of children or take care of other unpaid endeavours.\" Our Governor Trump said, \"Don't believe those fake numbers when you hear 4.9 and 5 percent unemployment. The number may be 28, 29, up to 35. In fact, I've heard 42% lately.\" While economists say that there are other more extensive accounts of unemployment or underemployment, there are none of the official accounts that currently exceed 9.9 per cent, and the highest reliable number we can calculate is 15.6 per cent. This is well below 42% - or even 28%. We're assessing the allegation of pants on fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05425"}
