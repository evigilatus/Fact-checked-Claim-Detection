Scott Walker, issued a \"recall petitioners\u2019 rights\" memo in late November 2011.\n\nThe group said you only have to be a qualified voter in Wisconsin; you don\u2019t have to have voted here before or even have registered to vote.\n\nMildly surprising to some perhaps, but the next claim really jumped out.\n\nThe group wrote: \"You can circulate or sign a recall petition even if you have already signed another recall petition (note, however, that only one signature per person will be counted).\"\n\nCan you really sign a petition twice?\n\nAnd will it count for one signature -- or none, or two -- if you pen your name on separate petitions?\n\nIt\u2019s one of many points, from both sides, that has prompted confusion -- and accusations that opponents are misleading folks for their advantage. We already looked at a few process-related questions.\n\nHere\u2019s one more.\n\nIn state statutes, the recall law (Section 9.10) lists eight ways a signature could be nullified. Among them: It\u2019s not dated, was too early or late, the signer lives out of state, the address can\u2019t be confirmed.\n\nThere was nothing noted about a case of multiple signatures.\n\nBut deeper in the statute, we found an answer: \"If a challenger can establish that a person signed the recall petition more than once, the 2nd and subsequent signatures may not be counted.\"\n\nThat means the first signature is still good, but duplicates can be thrown out, said Reid Magney, spokesman for the Government Accountability Board, which oversees elections the recall process.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t guarantee they will be. It\u2019s up to the incumbent to challenge the validity of signatures.\n\nThe state Accountability Board will review the petitions, but isn\u2019t staffed to systematically check for duplicates, Magney said. That puts the onus on the gatherers or Walker\u2019s side.\n\nIf people do sign more than once, they face no penalties.\n\n\"There are no legal restrictions,\" Magney said.\n\nThat doesn't speak to practical concerns.\n\nMagney, for instance, noted that people signing more than once could put their own cause in jeopardy because that falsely inflates the true number of signatures.\n\nMagney said the Government Accountability Board is not encouraging people to sign multiple times. But he added there is an instance in which they could be justified in doing so.\n\n\"People should not sign a petition more than once unless they have some good faith reason to believe that the first petition was somehow fraudulent and believes the circulator doesn\u2019t intend to file it,\" Magney said.\n\nMagney said the agency has tried to make that clear after an anonymous Facebook group (Operation Burn Notice) said it believed \"burning recall petitions is fun and games.\"\n\nOne Wisconsin Now\u2019s executive director, Scot Ross, cited the same motive for publicizing the fact that signing twice is not illegal.\n\nThe group is concerned about fraud, especially illegal destruction of recall petitions. Ross said One Wisconsin Now supports but is not directly involved in gathering signatures as the Democratic Party and allied groups push to get 540,208 valid signatures by Jan. 14, 2012, when the 60-day period closes.\n\nOn the right, recall critics including the Republican Party of Wisconsin, and the MacIver Institute for Public Policy, have raised a different set of concerns.\n\nAlso citing Facebook chatter, they have raised alarms about fraud and double counting, contending that some duplicates will not be weeded out by state officials.\n\n\"Without a systematic review of signatures, how will we know if the proper process was followed and the threshold for recall was reached legally?\" Brett Healy, president of the MacIver Institute, told us. \"What is to stop someone from signing a petition three times or 30 times?\"\n\nMagney said the state agency will look for obvious cases of fraud.\n\nOur conclusion\n\nWe can\u2019t predict whether all multiple signers will be found, but state law makes clear that one -- and only one -- signature is to be counted. And it\u2019s perfectly legal to sign more than once. That was the focus of the statement from One Wisconsin Now.\n\nWe rate it True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-12000"}
