It became one of the most famous promises made in history after Bush concluded a deal with a democratic Congress and raised taxes in 1990. Is there an echo in the Wisconsin Governor's race 2018? (Joff) Tony Evers spent months in the campaign saying he'd consider raising taxes if elected, before the pre-election axis. \"I plan to raise any taxes,\" said the Washington Post Democrat on November 1, 2018. \"I plan to raise taxes,\" said WISN-TV in November 4, 2018. But when Evers released his budget to state legislators on February 28, 2019, it included more than $1 billion in tax increases over the biennium. So we're going back to our web site \"Flip or Meter,\" which we're using to measure whether the politician has changed his or her position. Our normative reminder: We do not classify whether any change in policy or policy is good or bad - only whether politics is consistent. :: Evers campaign: No new taxes on Evers appeared in a state of heat with the current government. Scott Walker, a Republican, in early November when he changed his tune on tax increases. Relevant: Goff Wisconsin. Tony Evers turned his position on the dissolution of Wick Evers said that during the campaign he would consider raising taxes if elected, but at least on two occasions in early November he pledged that this would not be the case. Washington Post described it this way in the story of November 1, 2018: Evers said he would give $1.5 billion in government aid to school districts if elected. Walker says that Evers will raise taxes to do whatever he pledges to do. Evers responded in a phone interview, saying, \"He's a liar. ................................................................................................................ ................................................................................................................ ................................................................................................................ \"I plan to raise taxes.\" The spokesman for Evers Sam Lao then said that the Evers quote in the Post was a reference to a plan to reduce middle-class income taxes and tax exemption for farmers and manufacturers, although the story did not mention any such context. On January 26, 2021, Jim Steinke stated on Republican Twitter that they \"come to the table\" and were part of a compromise \"Give and Take\" on the Corona virus bill. \u2022 On January 27, 2012, three days later, Evers made an almost similar pledge in an interview with Mike Gosha on WISN-TV. Gosha asked about Walker's claim that Affer would have to collect taxes to finance his promises. Evers said, \"I plan to raise taxes.\" \"The idea that somehow he put me in this position says I'm going to tax, that's crazy. I never said that. We will work to ensure that the middle class of Wisconsin is protected by tax cuts.\" (Joff) :: We must raise the taxes that lead us to the post of Governor now. The Evers company has submitted a two-year budget of $83 billion that would repeal the State Right to Work Act, raise the minimum wage and expand the health-care programme under the \"Care of the Badger\" programme as well as the health-care programme through the Obama Care Programme. The gas tax will be increased by $485 million and other taxes by over $550 million. The Ivers Plan - which Republicans show no evidence of support - aims to balance the 8 per cent increase in gas tax per gallon with the termination of the State Minimum Gain Act, which makes retailers raise the price by 9.18 per cent above the wholesale price in most cases. On 1 March 2019, the Governor was asked how this budget is commensurate with his previous pledge not to raise taxes. \"I understand that there are some tax increases. It is clear that one of them is the gas tax, but the reason the budget is the way we listened to people in Wisconsin, \"Evers said to journalists in Appleton. \"They said they want better schools, well-resourced schools. They said they wanted affordable and accessible health care and health care. They said they wanted to fix the roads. So these issues, there's basically a cost to that.\" Three days later, the need for increased taxes has doubled, saying that increased funding for Wisconsin University and major interstate improvements are unlikely to occur without tax increases opposed by Republicans. \"We must have revenues,\" he said. When Evers' employees were asked to the contrary, they did not object to the change but defended logic and results. In an e-mail, Melissa Baldav, Deputy Chief of Staff of Evers, said: \"Under the Governor's proposal, the four-member median family will provide more than $1,000 in income taxes for this biennium.\" \"To help finance this tax exemption for the middle class, the Governor limits tax provisions that benefit a narrow segment of taxpayers to make them more consistent with other claimants.\" As we regressed in the November elections, Eversens told the people of Wisconsin that he would not raise taxes. Its first budget as Governor now contains proposals that would increase taxes by more than $1 billion. He explained the increases and, in one case, sought to reverse the increase with other changes. However, all of this continues to add to an increase in taxes. This is a complete prank.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00942"}
