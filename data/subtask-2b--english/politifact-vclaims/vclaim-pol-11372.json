Nan Orrock, an Atlanta Democrat. \"And if you ask them where they live, they will say it\u2019s a security issue and I cannot reveal that.\"\n\nOrrock was talking about Senate Bill 492, which is aimed at improving the state\u2019s purchasing process on construction projects. She wanted an amendment to the bill that would require the call center program be administered in the U.S.A.\n\n\"We contract with a private corporation, and they promptly ship the jobs overseas to administer the program, the state program, in this case for food stamps, the state program is administered from foreign shores,\" Orrock said.\n\nSo, is this state program administered from foreign shores?\n\nGeorgia\u2019s food stamp program, officially called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, is managed by the state\u2019s Department of Human Resources. The website has links to information in 11 languages.\n\nDHR spokeswoman Ravae Graham told PolitiFact Georgia that only 3 percent of the calls are handled overseas. Graham also sent us the most recent monthly call data. In February, 1.3 percent of the approximately 2.85 million calls were handled in India and Mexico. All the others were handled in this country.\n\nThe senator initially questioned the numbers in a telephone interview and asked for a few days to provide us information. A few days later, she sent us a report done in November by Channel 2 Action News that investigated the use of food stamp call centers outside the U.S. The report noted that 3 percent of those calls were handled overseas.\n\nOrrock was interviewed in that report. She talked about her concerns that some of these calls were handled outside the U.S. \"rather than creating those jobs here, because we will be employing people who will then put their paycheck back into our economy.\"\n\nOrrock told us in a statement that she could have spoken more precisely. She said \"administered\" was a poor choice of words.\n\n\"I am aware that the entire program is not delivered by people working overseas, and throughout my speech made reference to the call centers being delivered overseas,\" Orrock said in a statement. \"In speaking without prepared text perhaps I made a poor choice of words in saying administer, but my meaning was clear and I repeated several times that I was referring to the offshoring of call center jobs for the food stamp program, and not the administration of the entire food stamp program.\n\n\"Some of those call center services are delivered here, and my amendment was not aimed at those services,\" Orrock continued. \"The sole purpose of my amendment was to address the jobs offshored with Georgia taxpayer dollars.\"\n\nOrrock\u2019s amendment narrowly passed the Senate, but it was removed from the legislation when it came to the House of Representatives.\n\nAs for our call on her claim, only a small percentage of those food stamp calls are handled outside the U.S. Her statement contains an element of truth, but it ignores critical factors, such as the 97 percent of calls handled here, that would give a different impression of someone unfamiliar with the program.\n\nUnder our rating system, Orrock gets a Mostly False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11372"}
