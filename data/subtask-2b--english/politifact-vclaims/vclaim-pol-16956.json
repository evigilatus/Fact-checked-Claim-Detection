Social media posts about\u00a0about the matter\u00a0caught our attention, including this video\u00a0shared on Facebook:\n\"Africans living in China now being forced to sleep outside in the cold,\" reads the caption at the top. A narrator in the video states that \"Africans have become subject of racial profiling\" as \"Chinese nationals blame them for the rising number of ner coronavirus cases in the country.\"\nThe video, which carries a logo from The Savoy Show on it and appears to be a news story, was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Africans in at least one Chinese city are facing widespread evictions and discrimination related to COVID-19 fears.\nNumerous legitimate news reports describe such targeted evictions, stemming from fears of another COVID-19 outbreak, in the southern China city of Guangzhou. Home to many Africans, Guangzhou has long been one of China\u2019s main commercial and trading centers.\nOne report cited a case in which a police officer accompanied a landlord on an eviction of an African. Black residents in a part of Guangzhou known as \"Little Africa\" are being forced to remain inside their apartments \u2014 even if they have not traveled anywhere that would warrant a quarantine \u2014 and submit to coronavirus tests, the Washington Post reported. Chinese officials say they are trying to prevent a second wave of the coronavirus, focusing on foreigners, according to Al Jazeera. President Xi Jinping urged authorities to carefully watch for imported cases from \u200bother countries, state news agency Xinhua reported. But China has denied racism in the effort.\nBut the actions are widespread enough, according to the Associated Press, that African officials are confronting China over racist treatment of Africans, including Africans being ejected from hotels in the middle of the night.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMasks have negative impacts on 68% of children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jon Greenberg \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Chinese embassy in Zimbabwe said: \"It is harmful to sensationalize isolated incidents.
