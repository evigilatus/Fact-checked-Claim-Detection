It\u2019s Medicare, says President Barack Obama\u2019s re-election campaign.\n\n\"In Florida, they're already talking about how the Ryan-Romney plan will end Medicare and replace it with a voucher,\" begins a new radio ad from Obama\u2019s campaign.\n\nThe ad moves at a slow pace, featuring a back-and-forth between soothing male and female voices that say things such as the \"Ryan Medicare Plan\" would affect future retirees, and the \"Romney-Ryan plan\" would raise health care costs. They decry Romney\u2019s VP pick because Ryan wanted to \"change the whole game when it comes to Medicare and Social Security.\"\n\n\"What does that really say about Mitt Romney and whether he really understands Florida, the folks who live here, or what matters to our future?\"\n\nPolitiFact Florida wanted to analyze the statement that \"the Ryan-Romney plan will end Medicare and replace it with a voucher.\"\n\nWhat is the Ryan-Romney plan?\n\nThe \"Ryan-Romney\" or \"Romney-Ryan\" Medicare plan isn\u2019t a written-out plan, but Romney\u2019s statements of support for previous Medicare proposals.\n\nRyan, the House Budget Committee chairman from Wisconsin, has released several ideas since 2011 to overhaul the government-run health insurance program mainly for seniors. After Romney selected Ryan as his running mate, he said he and Ryan were on the same page for changes to Medicare.\n\n\"Paul Ryan and my plan for Medicare, I think, is the same, if not identical -- it's probably close to identical,\" he said in an Aug. 15, 2012, interview with a Wisconsin TV station.\n\nRomney was referring to Ryan\u2019s most recent plan, released earlier this year, which would rewrite how Medicare works for people who are under age 55. Instead of paying for seniors\u2019 health care bills, the government would offer future beneficiaries fixed payments -- voucher-like credits -- that could go toward private plans.\n\nBeneficiaries could use those credits to select a traditional Medicare plan or a private plan from a competitive marketplace, or exchange, that complies with standards set by the government. The amount a beneficiary receives would be based on the second least-expensive plan available.\n\nWe don\u2019t know whether the premium subsidy would be able to cover the same set of benefits as traditional Medicare, or how much it would add to out-of-pocket costs to beneficiaries, because the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office hasn\u2019t released a detailed analysis, as it did for an earlier version of Ryan\u2019s proposal when he provided the office with more substantial details.\n\nDoes this approach \"end Medicare\"?\n\nNo. Even when discussing Ryan\u2019s earliest Medicare overhaul, which would have moved the program entirely to private insurers, \u00a0PolitiFact has said repeatedly the proposal would not \"end,\" \"destroy\" or \"abolish\" Medicare.\n\nWhile Medicare under the original Ryan plan would have been essentially privatized, and many seniors would have had to pay more than they do now as health care costs increase, government-supported health insurance coverage for seniors would not have gone away away. \u00a0\n\nNow, under Ryan and Romney\u2019s proposals, a traditional Medicare plan would remain an option.\n\n Would Medicare be replaced with a voucher?\n\nPretty much. PolitiFact visited the semantics of the \"voucher\" issue in an Aug. 16, 2012, story, dissecting the linguistic differences between calling the Republicans\u2019 Medicare vision a \"voucher\" system versus their preferred terminology, \"premium support.\" After consulting experts in health care and language, PolitiFact rated Obama\u2019s characterization of Romney and Ryan wanting \"to turn Medicare into a voucher system\" Mostly True.\n\nWe should note, though, the government would continue to regulate Medicare plans. Also, the plan does not literally provide people with a paper voucher, but it does give them a credit to buy their own insurance. We think that\u2019s voucher-like.\n\nOur ruling\n\nA radio ad from the Obama campaign says, \"In Florida, they're already talking about how the Ryan-Romney plan will end Medicare and replace it with a voucher.\"\n\nNone of the plans presented by these candidates will \"end\" Medicare. Instead, Romney and Ryan support substantial changes to Medicare for people under 55. Depending on their income, future beneficiaries will receive a \"premium support payment\" to help offset the cost of a plan purchased through a competitive marketplace or for a traditional Medicare plan. We rate the Obama campaign\u2019s claim Mostly False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAFSCME\n\n\nstated on January 20, 2012 in a television ad\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"While Romney was a director of the Damon Corporation, the company was defrauding Medicare of millions.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Angie Drobnic Holan \u2022 January 23, 2012", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10541"}
