Rob Portman and former Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland got a little chippy over the future of entitlements like Social Security and Medicare.\nResponding to a question about the threat of Social Security funds being depleted by the year 2034, Portman said that he was in favor of \"means testing,\" a method of adjusting benefits according to a taxpayer\u2019s wealth.\n\"And that\u2019s part of the answer,\" Portman said. \"I have supported that also, with Medicare.\" \u00a0\nThe question then went to Strickland, who leapt at the chance to repeat a talking point he\u2019s used before in his campaign.\n\"Since Sen. Portman brought up Medicare,\" Strickland said, \"on the Neil Cavuto show, he said that it would be irresponsible not to cut Medicare. Those are his words.\"\nPortman interrupted, \"Irresponsible not to save it.\"\n\"Senator,\" Strickland said, \"your words were it would be irresponsible not to cut it.\"\nPortman shook his head in disagreement.\nWe decided to go to the tape \u2014 and Portman\u2019s YouTube channel took us right to it.\nHere\u2019s the exchange from June 2011 in which Portman, on Fox News, criticized Obama\u2019s \"Summer of Recovery,\" and discussed methods of addressing the national debt and deficit (emphasis ours):\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBetty Sutton\n\n\nstated on September 1, 2010 in a campaign fundraising e-mail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Ganley said that if elected, he wants to \u2018cut the dickens\u2019 out of Social Security, Medicare and Veterans\u2019 benefits.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Sabrina Eaton \u2022 September 20, 2010\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCavuto: \"So what are some of the things you want to cut, right now?\"\nPortman: \"Everything has to be on the table. So we have to deal with the entitlement programs, because they\u2019re not sustainable in their current form -- they\u2019re not going to be there for future generations.\"\nCavuto: \"So when Chuck Schumer and Harry Reid say, \u2018not Medicare,\u2019 what do you say?\"\nPortman: \"That they\u2019re being irresponsible and they know it. They\u2019re playing politics. If we don\u2019t deal with these programs that are now 60 percent of our budget, think about that. When you add up interest on the debt and the mandatory spending, and the entitlement programs -- very important programs -- \u00a0that\u2019s 60 percent of the budget now, it\u2019s the fastest-growing part of the budget. For them to take that off the table means they\u2019re not serious about dealing with our deficit and debt.\"\nWe see from this exchange that Portman didn\u2019t talk about saving Medicare, as he stated in the debate, but proposed that all entitlements including Medicare needed to be considered in terms of cost-cutting.\nHowever, Portman\u2019s statement was a hypothetical one, part of a discussion about Portman\u2019s disagreement with his colleagues in the Senate about managing entitlements. It was not an official policy statement or part of proposed legislation on Portman\u2019s part, as Strickland\u2019s debate statement suggested.\nOur ruling\nStrickland said Portman went on television and said \"it would be irresponsible not to cut Medicare. Those are his words.\"\nThose were not Portman's exact words on Cavuto's show. Portman said it would be irresponsible of any fellow senators to argue that Medicare would be off the table when discussing cutting entitlements.\u00a0Strickland made it sound as if Portman was singling out Medicare by itself.\nStrickland's\u00a0statement is partially accurate but imprecise, so we it\u00a0Half True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/439c351d-8c4c-468f-95c4-6399df46f007", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04103"}
