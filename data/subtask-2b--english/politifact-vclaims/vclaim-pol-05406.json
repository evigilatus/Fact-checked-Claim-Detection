Terry McAuliffe says Virginia\u2019s law requiring background checks on prospective gun buyers would be substantially broadened under a bipartisan agreement he\u2019s struck \u00a0with the General Assembly.\nVirginia now requires federally licensed dealers - those in the business of selling firearms - to conduct computerized checks to see whether a buyer has a disqualifying criminal record or mental health history. But casual sales between individuals are exempt and that, the governor says, opens a loophole for guns to fall into the wrong hands.\nMcAuliffe, a Democrat, is backing legislation that would position state police at Virginia gun shows to conduct voluntary background checks on the private sales.\n\"Under Virginia law, if you are a non-federally licensed dealer, you cannot get a background check even if you want one,\" McAuliffe said during a Feb. 3 interview with Mike Valerio of WWBT-TV in Richmond. \"We changed that law.\"\nMcAuliffe made a similar claim during a Feb. 1 interview on WJLA-TV in Washington. \"Even if the non-licensed dealer today wants to do a background check, he is prohibited by law,\" he said.\nThose claims and others by the governor were disputed in a full-page ad taken out in the Richmond Times-Dispatch on Feb. 9 by Everytown for Gun Safety, a national gun control group founded by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Everytown accuses McAuliffe, who promised in his 2013 campaign to seek background checks for all gun buyers, of backing weak reforms. The ad said \"voluntary background checks already exist\" for private sellers.\nSo we decided to investigate whether the governor is right in saying that an unlicensed seller in Virginia - say, someone who wants to get rid of a rifle or a handgun he has at home - now is legally barred at a gun show from getting a background check on a potential buyer.\nUnder state law, a person seeking to buy a firearm from a licensed dealer is required to fill out a form stating that he never has been convicted of a felony or adjudicated mentally incompetent and that he is not subject to a restraining order. The dealer forwards the information to the state police, which performs an \"instant background check\" and tells the dealer whether he can sell the gun to the customer.\nVirginia\u2019s law allows only federally licensed dealers to contact the state police for the check. \"The private seller, they can\u2019t even ask for a background check from the state police,\" Christina Nuckols, deputy press secretary for McAuliffe, told us on the phone.\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean a private seller is without recourse. He still can ask a licensed dealer to conduct a background check on the potential buyer but, if the dealer is willing, \u00a0it becomes a complicated process.\nUnder state law, licensed dealers can do background checks only for the purchase of firearms that are in their inventory. A private seller seeking a background check could \u00a0convey his gun on consignment to a dealer, said Corinne Geller, public relations manager for the state police.\nThat\u2019s not an unusual occurrence, according to David Hathcock, manager of Bob Moates Sports Shop in Chesterfield County, a licensed dealer of firearms. \"Most people want to make sure their guns to wind up in good hands,\" he told us, adding \"At any given time, I have 50 to 100 guns on consignment\" in the store.\nMoates, however, only does business from his store. And McAuliffe, in his comments, was specifically referring to private sellers at gun shows being barred from getting a background check.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe spoke to three Virginia dealers on Feb. 14 who\u00a0 had tables set up at The Nation\u2019s Gun Show in Chantilly. They all told us the governor\u2019s statement is wrong and they are occasionally approached by a private seller and a buyer seeking a check.\nThe dealers said they\u2019ll run the background check for a fee -- usually $25 to $35 -- to compensate for the trouble of putting the gun in their inventory and storing the information for a required 20 years.\n\"We do it all the time; it\u2019s absolutely legal,\" said Brian Parrish, owner of Triune Shooting Sports in Warrenton. He told us he gets an average \"one or two\" such requests at every gun show.\nSonny Condon, owner on Sonny\u2019s Guns & Transfers in Richmond, said it\u2019s rare when he gets such a request from a private seller, \"but it does happen.\"\nJerry Cochran, owner of Trader Jerry\u2019s in Tazewell County, said he only recently became aware that he could run a background check for a private seller. \"I\u2019ve done five of them in the last month,\" he said.\nMcAuliffe\u2019s measure would streamline the procedure by allowing a private seller to go straight to the state police at a gun show to request a background check. But, as before, neither the seller nor the buyer would be required legally to seek the check.\nMcAuliffe warns that a private seller who bypasses the new system could face increased liability if a gun he sold was used in a crime.\nPhilip Van Cleave, president of the pro-gun Virginia Citizens Defense League, said he thinks more private sellers will seek background checks if the legislation passes, \"but it\u2019s not going to be earth-shaking.\"\nThe bill, we should note, sailed through the House of Delegates on a 96-3 vote on Feb. 10 and now is pending in the Senate.\nOur ruling\nMcAuliffe says, \"Under Virginia law, if you are a non-federally licensed (gun) dealer, you cannot get a background check even if you want one.\"\nThe law requires only licensed dealers - those in the business of selling guns - to conduct background checks on a prospective buyer. As such, only licensed dealers are allowed to contact the state police to request the check. A private seller has no direct access to the background-check process.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean a private seller determined to get a background check is out in the cold. He can ask a gun dealer to conduct the check for him. But that\u2019s a messy process that requires a lot of paperwork and the private seller to temporarily convey his gun to the dealer.\nSo McAuliffe misspeaks when he says the law prohibits the private seller from getting a background check. But the law does make it very difficult for the private seller - who is under no obligation to seek a background check - to get one.\nWe rate McAuliffe\u2019s statement Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05406"}
