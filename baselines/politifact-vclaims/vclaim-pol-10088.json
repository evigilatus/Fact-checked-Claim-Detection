John \u00a0Kasich incorrectly claimed Ohio\u2019s economy was 38th in the nation when he took office. \"We were sixth in the nation in terms of economic job growth.\"", "truth_label": "false", "date": "stated on October 17, 2012 in an interview on CNN:", "title": "Ted Strickland claims John Kasich undersold the condition Ohio's economy was in when he took office", "text": "As in 2008, Ted Strickland has been among President Barack Obama\u2019s most enthusiastic campaign trail surrogates this year, serving as Obama\u2019s national campaign co-chairman and regularly appearing on national media outlets to urge Obama\u2019s re-election.\n\nThe former Ohio governor has also been publicly pondering a rematch against John Kasich, the Republican who defeated him by two percentage points in 2010, and trying to burnish his own legacy as governor by arguing that the state\u2019s economic recovery actually started during Strickland\u2019s term in office.\n\nIn an appearance Oct. 7 on CNN\u2019s \"State of the Union\"\u00a0with Candy Crowley, Strickland touted his own performance as governor as he argued with Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine over whether Obama or Republican Mitt Romney would win Ohio\u2019s presidential vote.\n\nAfter Crowley showed a clip from Kasich\u2019s Aug. 28 Republican National Convention speech\u00a0where the current governor argued that Ohio \"needs a new partner in Washington,\" Crowley asked Strickland who\u2019s responsible for Ohio\u2019s relatively good economy. \u00a0\n\nStrickland responded by accusing Kasich of \"not telling the truth\" during a part of the speech that immediately followed the excerpt that Crowley showed her viewers.\n\n\"He said in that speech that Ohio\u2019s economy was 38th, I believe, in the nation when he took office,\" Strickland told Crowley. \"That\u2019s not true, we were sixth in the nation in terms of economic job growth.\"\n\nOhio\u2019s recovery, Strickland said, began before John Kasich became governor.\n\n\"If you look at the data, Ohio\u2019s unemployment declined 1.6 percent in 2010. It declined another 1.7 percent in the first year and a half of the Kasich administration.\" Strickland went onto attribute Ohio\u2019s turnaround to the Recovery Act and the auto rescue.\n\nPolitiFact Ohio decided to check Strickland\u2019s claim that Ohio actually ranked sixth, rather than 38th.\n\nWe started with Kasich\u2019s speech. What Kasich actually said was: \"When I came into office, we were 48th in the nation in job creation. \" Later in the speech, Kasich indicated his 48th in the nation comments cited job creation numbers from the four years before he took office -- which corresponds to Strickland\u2019s term.\n\nData from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that between Strickland\u2019s inauguration in January 2007 and his departure in January 2011, Ohio lost 372,300 jobs. Only two states - Florida and California - lost more jobs in that time, according to BLS data. That backs up Kasich\u2019s contention that Ohio was 48th in the nation in job creation during the four years before he took office.\n\nWe asked Strickland where he got his statistic that Ohio was sixth in economic job growth when Kasich took office. Strickland cited a 2010 report that he said was issued by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. His aide, Louis Capobianco, subsequently sent an email that provided an August 2010 table\u00a0compiled by Reed Construction Data, which he said had come from the Federal Reserve report. Our search of reports released by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia did not find that table, and the bank\u2019s manager of media relations, Marliyn Wimp, said the bank did not release any reports that classified Ohio as the sixth fastest growing state.\n\n\"That must have originated somewhere else,\" she said.\n\nReed Construction Data, which compiles data for the architectural, engineering and construction industries in North America,did not return PolitiFact Ohio\u2019s calls about the table. It places Ohio behind New Hampshire, North Dakota, West Virginia, Michigan and South Carolina in \"recent economic performance\" over the three months that ended in June of 2010.\n\nAnother table on the same page ranked Ohio tenth from the bottom in the \"Change in economic activity index - from 2007-2008 peak index value.\"\n\nAn article on Reed Construction\u2019s website\u00a0said the table tracked \"the state economic growth indexes calculated by the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank from state employment and income data which are benchmarked to approximately track national GDP growth.\" The article said a manufacturing boom had pushed the industrial Great Lakes states past New England as the strongest regional economy after many years at the bottom of the list, and that economic expansion was underway in 46 states.\n\nPolitiFact Ohio also checked whether Strickland\u2019s statements about Ohio\u2019s declining unemployment were correct. BLS data bears out Strickland\u2019s assertion that Ohio\u2019s unemployment rate dropped by 1.6 percent during 2010, Strickland\u2019s last year in office. The state\u2019s unemployment rate fell from 10.6 percent in January of 2010 to 9 percent in January of 2011. From February of 2011 through August of 2012, it fell from 8.9 percent to 7.2 percent, as Strickland said it did.\n\nWhile Strickland might be correct that Ohio\u2019s economic recovery began on his watch -- the state\u2019s unemployment rate did begin to drop during the last year of his administration -- \u00a0he was incorrect on the statistics he cited in criticizing Kasich.\n\nThe former governor did not accurately cite Kasich\u2019s words when he tried to rebut them on CNN. During his speech, Kasich said that Ohio was 48th in the nation in job creation when he took office. He did not say that the state\u2019s economy was 38th in the nation, as Strickland maintained. \u00a0\n\nWhat\u2019s more, BLS data backs up Kasich\u2019s assertion. Ohio\u2019s rate of job creation did rank 48th relative to other states during Strickland\u2019s term. So Strickland\u2019s statement that Kasich \"was not telling the truth\" was itself incorrect.\n\nAnd the statistic Strickland cites to support his claim that Ohio actually ranked sixth in economic job growth is misportrayed. That statistic from Reed Construction Data refers to \"recent economic performance,\" not \"economic job growth,\" as Strickland said on CNN. It also examines a narrow three month period of time during 2010 - not the full four years of Strickand\u2019s administration that Kasich\u2019s speech referenced.\n\nOn the Truth-O-Meter, Strickland\u2019s claim rates False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10088"}
