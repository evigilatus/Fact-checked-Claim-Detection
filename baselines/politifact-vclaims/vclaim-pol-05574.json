If Darragh was an American, then under American law, Cruz was an American at birth.\nWe were curious about Trump\u2019s claim\u00a0in a Jan. 5, 2016, interview\u00a0with the Post -- offered by the candidate without documentary evidence -- that Cruz has had more than one passport, implying the\u00a0Houston lawyer spent some time trying to pass as a citizen of either Canada or the U.S.\nPrior to a Trump rally in Lowell, Mass., the Post asked Trump about Cruz\u2019s Canadian roots.\nTrump replied: \"Republicans are going to have to ask themselves the question: \u2018Do we want a candidate who could be tied up in court for two years?\u2019 That\u2019d be a big problem. It\u2019d be a very precarious one for Republicans because he\u2019d be running and the courts may take a long time to make a decision. You don\u2019t want to be running and have that kind of thing over your head.\"\nTrump went on: \"I\u2019d hate to see something like that get in his way. But a lot of people are talking about it, and I know that even some states are looking at it very strongly, the fact that he was born in Canada and he has had a double passport.\"\nThere\u2019s no such thing, far as we could tell, as a \"double passport.\" We suspect Trump was suggesting Cruz had obtained both one U.S. and a Canadian one--though our requests for factual backup drew no replies from Trump\u00a0representatives.\nMeantime, when we asked Cruz spokesman Rick Tyler about Cruz ever having a \"double passport,\" Tyler\u00a0replied that Cruz had \"never\" had a Canadian passport or, he said by email, applied for one.\nWhether he knew it or not, Cruz for much of his life had dual citizenship, meaning citizenship in Canada and the United States. A\u00a0Canadian government website\u00a0says: \"You do not apply for dual citizenship and there is no related certificate. Canadians are allowed to take foreign citizenship while keeping their Canadian citizenship.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 23, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBiden invested the entire family fortune in Ukraine gas and oil.

That means he could assert the right to vote in Canada or even run for Parliament. On a lunch break from the U.S. Senate, he could head to the nearby embassy \u2014 the one flying a bright red maple leaf flag \u2014 pull out his Calgary, Alberta, birth certificate and obtain a passport.\" (We checked a\u00a0Canadian government\u00a0web page; it says\u00a0an adult in the United States seeking a new Canadian passport must apply by mail.)\nIn 2013, Cruz reacted to the News\u2019 story by vowing to shed his Canadian citizenship, which he successfully renounced as of May 14, 2014, the News\u00a0reported\u00a0in June 2014.\nOur ruling\nTrump said Cruz \"has had a double passport.\"\nTrump didn\u2019t provide and we didn\u2019t find evidence that Cruz, who relinquished his dual citizenship in 2014, ever carried passports for the U.S. and Canada--nor, Cruz\u2019s camp advises, did he ever apply for a Canada passport.\nWe rate the claim False.\n\nFALSE \u2013 The statement is not accurate.\nClick here for\u00a0more\u00a0on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonald Trump\n\n\n \nCanadian-born Ted Cruz \"has had a double passport.\"\n\nRead more\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmbed", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05574"}
