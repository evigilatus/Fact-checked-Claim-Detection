No \u2014 as Pelosi\u2019s office quickly clarified after PolitiFact inquired.\n\nYou may not realize this, but as a nonprofit news organization,\u00a0we depend on \u2014 and answer to \u2014 you.

Connelly clarified that she should have said that \"children are close to half of Medicaid enrollees\" and said she \"inverted\" the statistic about long-term care spending.\n\"It\u2019s not that two-thirds of Medicaid goes to long-term care, it\u2019s that two-thirds of long-term care is paid for by Medicaid,\" citing data posted by the Alliance for Retired Americans. (To be precise, according to the group, the share of long-term care costs paid by Medicaid was 62 percent in 2015.)\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at the actual data for age and long-term care spending.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

The percentage may have changed somewhat following the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, but experts said they did not expect there to have been a dramatic shift.\nHere\u2019s the full breakdown:\n\nAs for long-term care costs as a share of Medicaid spending, it\u2019s quite a bit less than the two-thirds Pelosi cited. In 2016, various types of long-term care accounted for 21.4 percent of all Medicaid spending.\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nOur ruling\nPelosi said, \"Two-thirds of the people who use Medicaid are poor children, but two-thirds of the money is for long-term care for seniors, whether in a facility or at home.\"\nHer office acknowledged that she misspoke.
