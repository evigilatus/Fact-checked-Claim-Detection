It was the event\u2019s second year. NCAE President Mark Jewell said he thought the crowd was\u00a0bigger than last year.\nOn Wednesday afternoon,\u00a0Jewell tweeted\u00a0his appreciation of advocates who attended the rally.\n\"Thank you North Carolina. You showed up in mass to insist that the state fund our public school legislative priorities,\" Jewell tweeted, along with two images.\nThe image on the left depicts a mighty crowd on Halifax Mall, the grassy field behind the legislature where ralliers congregated after marching through downtown Raleigh. Hardly any grass can be seen in the sea of red shirts \u2014 which was a red flag.\nOn Twitter, Jewell faced almost immediate pushback from some who alleged that the photo was altered. Earlier Wednesday, similar photos were posted (since deleted) on unverified Twitter accounts\u00a0Organizing Action NC\u00a0and the\u00a0Student North Carolina Association of Educators at NC State University.\nA similar photo \u2014 perhaps the same photo \u2014 was also posted on the\u00a0Facebook page for Red 4 Ed NC, a nonprofit group that advocates for educators. The photos were later removed.\nGiven the pushback to Jewell\u2019s photo and how much it was shared on social media, PolitiFact wondered if it was authentic. We reached out to Jewell by email but didn\u2019t immediately get a response. Our review found it shows clear signs of manipulation.\nJewell deleted the post Thursday afternoon.\n\"There was a rally photo circulating yesterday of Halifax Mall that is believed to have been photo shopped according to media reports. I have since removed it from my sites,\" he\u00a0tweeted.\nTaken from a legislator\nThe photo appears to have been snapped from the roof of the legislative building. The spot was popular for ralliers, journalists and politicians.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews & Observer reporter Dawn Vaughan\u00a0tweeted\u00a0video footage of the Halifax mall gathering. Reporter Leigh Tauss took photos of the Halifax mall for a story in\u00a0Indyweek. Jeff Tiberii, a reporter for WUNC,\u00a0tweeted similar photos\u00a0and on Thursday tweeted his concern for altered images circulating on social media.\nBut the photos shared by Jewell and the Red 4 Ed Facebook page show less green space and more people than the photos shared by reporters on the scene \u2014 and were likely altered versions of a photo taken and tweeted by\u00a0NC Rep. Grier Martin.\nThe image shared by Jewell and the photo shared by Martin show ralliers in the same positions.\nComparing photos\n\n\nTurn your attention to the white tent. On the left side, a person wearing a red shirt and jean shorts is walking in the same position in both pictures. Near the pole on the right side of the tent, a person in a green shirt, white hat and khaki shorts is also positioned exactly the same in both photos.\nThere are other examples where people are in identical positions, but let\u2019s look now at how Jewell\u2019s image was doctored. Sections of the photo were copied and then duplicated to make the crowd seem larger than it was.\nAt the bottom-right side of the screen, there\u2019s a person in a white shirt and a person in a blue shirt that appear twice in the photo. In the center of the crowd, signs in the same exact size, color and position appear more than once.\nChristiaan Triebert, a journalist on the visual investigations team at The New York Times, noticed the same similarities as PolitiFact. He said it appears \"that the crowd size was increased using the clone tool in Photoshop.\"\nIt\u2019s unclear who doctored it. Martin told PolitiFact that he took the photo at 11:46 a.m. Wednesday and, apart from sharing it on Twitter, didn\u2019t share it with anyone.\n\"I had no contact from anyone about my photo,\" Martin said in an email.\nOur ruling\nJewell tweeted a photo that showed a sea of red education advocates covering most of the Halifax Mall, located behind the legislature. There was a crowd. However, the photo was altered to make the crowd look larger than it was in reality.
