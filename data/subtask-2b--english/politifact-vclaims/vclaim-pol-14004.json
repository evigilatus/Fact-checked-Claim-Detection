Jim DeMint, R-S.C., to seek a nonbinding ban on budget earmarks among Republicans in the chamber. \"I think earmarks are bad for our country,\" Rubio said in an interview before Election Day.\n\nBut Rubio didn't always think that way, says former Barack Obama Florida director Steven Schale.\n\n\"I don't remember Rubio disagreeing with earmarks in the Florida Legislature,\" Schale posted on Twitter on Nov. 15, 2010, in reply to a story about Rubio supporting an earmark ban. In a separate post, Schale offered his evidence. \"Re: (Marco) Rubio's support of earmark ban: In 2002 alone (a bad budget year in Florida), he requested 37 earmarks worth $43 million.\"\n\nIn this case, we wanted to check Schale's math.\n\nRubio served in the Florida House of Representatives from 2000-2008, the last two years as House speaker. During his U.S. Senate campaign, Rubio was criticized by independent candidate Gov. Charlie Crist for requesting millions of dollars in pork projects, which Crist said he had to veto. We've rated two specific claims when it comes to Rubio and earmarks before -- we called a claim that he supported $800,000 to replace the turf at a field where he played flag football Half True and a claim that he tried to insert $1.5 milllion into the budget for a rowing institute Pants on Fire!\n\nFlorida's version of the earmark was something called a Community Budget Issue Request --\u00a0a budget request legislators made for local projects. Legislators had to\u00a0file their request ahead of the budget planning process and\u00a0attach their name to every request. \u00a0The Legislature stopped the practice in 2009, the year after Rubio left office.\n\nIn 2002, Rubio's third year, the Florida House requested $1.5 billion in Community Budget Issue Requests, according to data kept by the state. To put that in perspective, the state budget that Gov. Jeb Bush signed that year totaled $50 billion, and legislators had been warned of a tight budget. (They actually were summoned back to Tallahassee to slash $1 billion from the budget in December 2001 to keep the state from going in the red.)\n\nRubio's member budget requests for 2002 remain archived on a state website, which confirms Schale's statement.\n\nRubio requested funding for 37 projects totalling $43,697,787.\u00a0Here's the complete list.\n\n\u2022 $7.67 million, requested by Jackson Health System, to provide inpatient and outpatient health care services to people with HIV/AIDS, including medications, psycho-social counseling, education and case management.\n\n\u2022 $5 million, requested by Miami-Dade County, for an elevated, automated people-mover system connecting three elevated stations in front of the Miami International Airport passenger terminal with the planned Miami Intermodal Center.\n\n\u2022 $5 million, requested by Miami-Dade County Empowerment Trust, for a federally designated \"empowerment zone\" that targets county, state, and federal resources to stimulate economic development in distressed, low-income areas.\n\n\u2022 $2.25 million, requested by the city of Miami Springs, to eliminate recurring flood conditions through stormwater drainage improvements.\n\n\u2022 $2 million, requested by the Achievement & Rehabilitation Centers, Inc., for ARC Broward Inc., to provide intensive therapeutic & behavioral intervention for children aged 5-12 with severe autism or related disorders.\n\n\u2022 $1.5 million, requested by the South Florida Water Management District, for construction to permanently mitigate the recurring flood threat.\n\n\u2022 $1.5 million, requested by the city of West Miami, to reduce a wastewater collection system budget deficit.\n\n\u2022 $1.3 million, requested by the city of South Miami, to complete an upgrade to the city's stormwater drainage system to eliminate or reduce pollutants from the direct discharge of stormwater runoff and prevent local flooding.\n\n\u2022 $1.25 million, requested by the city of West Miami, for drainage improvements.\n\n\u2022 $1.2 million, requested by the city of South Miami, to provide high-quality municipal water and fire protection in the city.\n\n\u2022 $1.2 million by the city of Miami Springs, to relocate utilities to satisfy state DOT objectives at certain intersections.\n\n\u2022 $1.18 million, requested by Jackson Health System, for residential care for adjudicated substance abusing adolescents, including physician care, social work, nursing, psychology, medications and education.\n\n\u2022 $1 million, requested by the University of Miami School of Medicine for programs in spinal cord injury and brain research;

Republican Mike Bennett $74.8 million; Republican Bev Kilmer $120.4 million; and Democrat Curtis Richardson $130.1 million).\n\nIn 2001, Rubio actually requested even more money -- $101.2 million\u00a0for 72\u00a0projects -- but Rubio did not make another Community Budget Issue Request after 2002, according to the state database. Not one in six years.\n\nBut those aren't the years Schale referenced.\u00a0Schale said Rubio requested 37 earmarks in 2002 worth $43 million -- which he says is at odds with Rubio's current support for an earmark ban. Schale has his math right, according to figures kept by the state. Rubio that year ranked\u00a0fifth in requests for\u00a0money among Florida House members.
