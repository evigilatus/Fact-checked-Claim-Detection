Cases fell", "text": "Stacey Abrams has often come up as a potential running mate for presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden. The Georgia Democrat nearly won the 2018 governor\u2019s race. In an interview with Mother Jones, Abrams said if she were in the governor\u2019s mansion today, she would have handled the COVID-19 crisis totally differently.\n\"I wouldn\u2019t have led Georgia to be one of the last states to shut down, and we certainly wouldn\u2019t have been one of the first to reopen,\" Abrams said in a May 7 interview. \"Since the reopening of the state, we\u2019ve seen our COVID rate skyrocket by 40%.\"\nAbrams\u2019 statistic is wrong.\nAbrams spokesman Seth Bringman said she relied on a post that briefly appeared on Forbes.com. The post was withdrawn.\nVirus testing in Georgia, drawn from the Covid Testing Project data, shows there was a smaller increase in the number of new cases in the period after Gov. Brian Kemp relaxed restrictions than in a similar period before the change.\nUnder Kemp, Georgia was one of the first states to reopen businesses.\nBetween April 24 and April 27, restaurants, gyms, beauty parlors and a number of other kinds of businesses began to welcome customers, so long as they followed rules to keep patrons separated and took other measures to prevent infection.\nIn the 12 days before April 24, when Kemp began easing restrictions, Georgia had a total of 9,695 confirmed coronavirus cases.\nIn the 12 days after (which coincides with Abrams\u2019 interview), Georgia reported about 1,100 fewer confirmed cases, 8,549.\nOverall, comparing the two time periods, cases in Georgia decreased 12% after the reopening. They didn\u2019t increase 40%.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPat Toomey\n\n\nstated on January 19, 2021 in a hearing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere will be several thousand dollars in payments going to families with six-figure incomes who\u2019ve had no income interruption whatsoever.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jessica Calefati \u2022 January 21, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBringman said no one has firm numbers in Georgia.\n\"The state is not producing accurate data, thus there is no way to know how many Georgians who have suffered,\" he said.\nThe state has had problems, particularly in tracking deaths at long-term care facilities.\nBut without good data, Abrams also wouldn\u2019t have any basis to say cases rose 40%.\u00a0\nWhen she spoke, it was way too early to know if relaxing the rules on business had caused the disease to spread.\nIt takes anywhere from three to 14 days for an infection to take hold. And after that, more days before a person feels ill enough to see a doctor, get tested and get test results back.\nBoston University epidemiologist Eleanor Murray emphasized that the impact of reopening business life in Georgia won\u2019t be clear for some time.\u00a0\n\"There could be up to a month or more delay between when a case is reported and when the infection was transmitted,\" Murray said. \"This makes it very difficult to say whether cases are from before or after opening, especially in the first few weeks.\"\nOur ruling\nAbrams said that after Georgia\u2019s governor reopened certain business activities, the COVID-19 rate rose 40%.\nIn reality, the period after reopening had 12% fewer cases. Even if the policy shift did cause infections to rise, it wouldn\u2019t appear until several weeks later. Abrams spoke before that effect would show up in the data.\nWe rate this claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18313"}
