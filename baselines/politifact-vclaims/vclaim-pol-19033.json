Think twice before you fall for the bulls---, St. Louis,\" said Rogers, the Republican candidate for Missouri\u2019s 1st District.\u00a0\nHe included a picture of Bush\u2019s cases on a page in Casenet, a database for court cases. The picture shows eight court cases his opponent was involved in. Bush has 11 cases in all \u2014 but all of them are civil, not criminal.\nA criminal is someone who commits an offense against the state \u2014 a crime \u2014\u00a0 as opposed to a civil case, where one person or institution sues another, according to the American Bar Association. A con artist, according to Merriam-Webster, is \"a person who tricks other people in order to get their money.\"\u00a0\nBush\u2019s 11 cases happened between 1999 and 2018. The types of cases are listed in Casenet as tax actions, landlord actions and contract actions.\u00a0 For instance, Convergence Receivables LC received a default judgment against Bush and had her wages garnished. The company is one of a group of businesses known as debt buyers that purchase past-due accounts from businesses and then try to collect from individuals.\u00a0 Bush\u2019s cases show that she\u2019s been in debt on multiple occasions \u2014 for rent, credit cards and tax issues.\n\"They look like a variety of collection actions,\" University of Missouri law professor Frank Bowman III said. \"I mean, it looks like she certainly had some trouble paying her bills from time to time.\"\nBush\u2019s website attributes the delinquencies to her financial issues as a single mother.\u00a0\n\"Cori Bush\u2019s tax burden was more than she could afford as a working class, single mother who was also paying off student loans for her nursing degree,\" the website reads.\u00a0\nThe site acknowledges that Bush has dealt with lawsuits for not paying taxes and says Bush has also experienced homelessness.\nBowman says these cases probably deal with delinquent or late payments, such as for local tax bills.\u00a0\nHe also says Rogers should be careful about calling people criminals.\u00a0\n\"When you accuse someone of a crime, actually committing a crime, and they have not committed a crime, I mean, normally that's libelous,\" Bowman said.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 23, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBiden invested the entire family fortune in Ukraine gas and oil.

Starting to get the picture.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRogers\u2019 response\nWhen shown that all of Bush\u2019s cases are civil and not criminal, Rogers said he still supports what he said in his Facebook post: that she is literally a criminal.\nIn an email and an interview with Rogers, the candidate gave a number of claims about why Bush is still a con artist and criminal. Here\u2019s what Rogers said.\n\n\nBush has not sent in her personal financial disclosure to the House of Representatives.\n\n\nShe pays herself with campaign contributions.\n\n\nShe says she\u2019s a pastor, but doesn\u2019t work for a church.\u00a0\n\n\nShe says she is a nurse but was \"disbarred.\"\n\n\nWe looked into each of his claims.\n\n\nAccording to the House of Representatives Office of the Clerk, Bush sent in her personal financial disclosure on Aug. 15. She was three months late. There is a $200 fine for every 30 days the disclosure is overdue, though House rules allow for extensions, according to the House of Representatives Committee on Ethics. It is unclear if Bush got an extension, as her team would not comment. Candidates are only prosecuted if they do not submit their disclosure at all, or if they falsify their disclosure documents.\n\n\nAccording to the FEC, it is legal to use campaign contributions as a salary. So far, Bush has reported wage expenses of $25,285 from her 2020 campaign.\n\n\nAccording to Bush\u2019s website, she is an ordained pastor, and pastored at Kingdom Church\u00a0 International in St. Louis, which she founded, from 2013-2015. Now she \"has since taken her faith-based work directly into the streets, where she serves as a spiritual support for the unhoused community.\"\n\n\nAccording to Bush\u2019s website, she did lose her certification as a nurse. After paying her outstanding tax debts, her nursing license was reinstated.\n\n\nOur ruling\nRogers called Bush a \"career criminal and a con artist\" on Facebook, but there is no evidence to suggest that Bush is either. The court cases Rogers provided as evidence were all civil cases.\u00a0\nNone of the purported evidence provided by Rogers to back his claim held up to the facts, either. When told of our findings, Rogers insisted he was still right.\u00a0\nDue to his denial of the facts and baseless claims, we rate Rogers\u2019 claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19033"}
