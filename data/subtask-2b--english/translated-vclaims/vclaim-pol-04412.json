Children hear more than we think. Parents and teachers are already concerned about what they call \"the effect of the trump.\" They report that intimidation and harassment are on the rise in our schools, especially targeting coloured, Muslim and immigrant students.\" We wondered if Clinton was right teachers reporting an increase in intimidation and harassment, and if so, what does that have to do with Trump? The source of Clinton is a report issued in April by the Poverty Law Centre of the South, a civil rights and anti-discrimination group. The report entitled \"The Impact of Trump: The Impact of the Presidential Campaign on the Schools of Our Nation.\" The Centre conducted an online survey of some 2,000 K-12 teachers and found: \"Teachers have observed an increase in bullying, harassment and intimidation of students whose races, religions or nationalities were verbal targets of candidates in the campaign.\" While their findings are directly consistent with Clinton &apos; s claim, it is important to note that this was not a scientific survey, as the report points out. Respondents do not represent a random sample of teachers, and those who have chosen to respond to the survey are likely to be the most interested in the impact of the campaign on students. This means that it would be inaccurate to conclude from the survey that bullying and harassment are generally increasing throughout the country. It is a collection of storytellers' experiences for teachers. We have looked for a scientific study that speaks of this same question but has not been able to find it, mostly because there is a tendency to delay this type of data, which means that data on trends in bullying in 2016 will not be published until 2017 or later. Sherry Bowman, a professor at the University of Arizona who was looking at bullying, said that the process of preparing for and obtaining approval for a scientific study was long and cumbersome, and would not be approved before the elections. However, Bowman said that the report of the Southern Poverty Law Centre should not be rejected, as its statements showed important recurring themes. Here are some interesting details from the survey. We bear in mind that the survey did not mention any names of candidates at all: respondents made a total of 5,000 comments. Of these, one in five tramps was male. All other candidates were mentioned less than 200 times in combination. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" By Samantha Buterman: January 11, 2021, \"more than one third have noticed an increase in anti-Muslim or anti-immigrant sentiment.\" \"Teachers state that students have \"been encouraged\" to use temptations, engage in name-calling and make inflammatory statements towards each other, and \"children use candidate names as contempt for each other.\" More than two thirds of teachers reported that students - mostly immigrants, migrant children and Muslims - had expressed fears or fears about what might happen to them or their families after the elections. On the other hand, intimidation can be contrary to Clinton's image. The survey also referred to examples of students being bullied by others because they or their parents supported Trump. According to Maureen Costello, the reporter and the Director of the Centre &apos; s Educational Tolerance Project, the results support Clinton &apos; s claim. \"It is fair to say that reports say that teachers who respond to us actually see an increase in the amount of harassment and a change in the quality of intimidation,\" Costello said, adding that they have received more than 300 additional comments not required from educators since the report was issued, all expressing similar feelings. \"I doubt Clinton may be right, but the data is not there to support the statement from an evidence-based scientific perspective,\" said Dorothy Spellage, a professor at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champpen and a leading bully. A spokesman for Tramp rejected the survey, indicating that it was not scientific. Clinton said: \"Fathers and teachers are already concerned about what they call the \"tramp effect.\" They reported that bullying and harassment are on the rise in our schools, especially targeting color students, Muslims, and immigrants.\" The teachers surveyed by the Poverty Law Centre in the South reported an increase in bullying and harassment, particularly with regard to anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim sentiments. Many of these teachers, undesired, referred to Trump's speech in his campaign and accompanying speech as the probable cause of this behaviour. The term Trump effect is the product of the authors of the survey. The survey is not scientific because it is based on storytelling reports. However, experts in bullying told us that the survey conducted by the Poverty Law Centre of the South and their sense of current trends in schools support Clinton &apos; s view. We assess her claim mostly correct. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/796885d56-6956-4e5e-8e24-60a56a099c5b", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04412"}
