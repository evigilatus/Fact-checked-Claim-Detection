I would be bound by it, and if I start commenting on, \u2018I agree with this case,\u2019 or \u2018don\u2019t agree with this case,\u2019 I think we get into a slippery slope.\"\nOther then-nominees such as Judges Andrew Oldham and Neomi Rao followed her lead (and were confirmed without any Democratic votes).\nSen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Ct., who frequently asks Trump nominees about Brown vs. Board, asked Oldham and Rao multiple times if they think the case was \"correctly decided.\"\nBoth said it would be inappropriate for a lower court nominee to take a stance on any particular Supreme Court decision.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Even the most universally accepted court case is outside the bounds of a federal judge to comment on,\" Oldham said, refusing more than once to offer his two cents.\nRao also danced around Blumenthal\u2019s repeated questions, saying the case was \"a really important precedent of the Supreme Court,\" but adding, \"As a judicial nominee, I think it\u2019s not appropriate for me to comment on the correctness of particular precedents.\"\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Vitter, Oldham, Rao and other nominees who dodged the question did not say they believed Brown vs. Board was ruled incorrectly.\u00a0\nSome Trump nominees have said they would not weigh in on any established Supreme Court precedent. Others, such as Ada Brown, who has yet to be confirmed, have cited a judicial canon that says judges \"should not make public comment on the merits of a matter pending or impending in any court.\"\nIt\u2019s also possible some have feared that voicing an opinion on Brown vs. Board would open them up to similar lines of questioning about other major Supreme Court rulings, such as Roe vs. Wade, which established a legal right to abortion.\nWhatever the reason, it\u2019s still true, as Martin claimed, that they stopped short of \"say(ing) that Brown vs. Board of Education was properly decided.\"\nHowever, Buzzfeed News reported in June that some of Trump\u2019s more recent nominees have endorsed Brown vs. Board in their hearings. According to that report, five of the six nominees at a May 22 hearing said the decision, or the legal reasoning behind it, was correct.\nSeveral current Supreme Court justices have also stated their support for Brown vs. Board during confirmation hearings.\u00a0\nChief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. endorsed the decision, and Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh called it \"inspirational\" and \"the single greatest moment in Supreme Court history,\" according to the Washington Post.\nJustice Neil Gorsuch, on the other hand, resisted questions about specific Supreme Court precedents during his confirmation hearing. But even he ultimately told Blumenthal, \"We\u2019re on the same page on Brown vs. Board of Education, senator. It\u2019s a great and important decision.\"\nFor what it\u2019s worth, Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen also avoided giving a clear answer on whether he believes the case was properly decided during his own nomination hearing. He was confirmed by the Senate, again without a single Democratic vote, in May.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nMartin said Republicans \"are advancing federal judges who won't even say that Brown vs. Board of Education was properly decided.\"\nA number of Trump judicial nominees have refused to give clear answers when asked if they thought Brown vs. Board of Education \u2014 the decision that ruled racial segregation in public schools unconstitutional \u2014 was correctly decided. It\u2019s important to note they haven't said it was wrongly decided; rather, they have refused to comment on Supreme Court precedents.\u00a0\nThose nominees have been advanced largely along party lines.\nWe rate this statement Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00398"}
