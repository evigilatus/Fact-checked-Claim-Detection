And so, we have a justice system that is not equal justice under the law,\" the U.S. senator from New Jersey said in a Las Vegas TV interview.\u00a0\n\"We have people who can\u2019t get jobs, can\u2019t get business licenses because of nonviolent drug crimes. And especially at a time when we\u2019re legalizing things like marijuana. In 2017, we had more marijuana possession arrests in our country than all other violent crimes combined. And so, I\u2019m going to fight to end this.\"\nThe arrests claim is one Booker has made before; and national news media have reported a similar statistic.\u00a0\nWhat we found is that Booker is right for 2017\u00a0 \u2014 and for 2016 and 2015, as well.\nThe numbers\nAs Booker indicated, legalizing marijuana is on the upswing.\nPolitiFact reported in 2018 that two in three Americans favor marijuana legalization, a record-high measure of public support, and a majority of states now permit legal use in some form. That\u2019s despite the fact that, under federal law, pot is a Schedule I drug, with \"a high potential for abuse.\"\u00a0\nAs for Booker\u2019s claim, according to the FBI\u2019s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) database, law enforcement nationwide made an estimated 518,617 arrests for violent crimes in 2017. That includes murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, rape, robbery and aggravated assault.\nThat figure is lower than the 599,282 arrests made for possession of marijuana.\n(In cases where a person is arrested for a violent crime and marijuana possession, it is recorded as a violent-crime arrest because that is the more serious offense, according to the UCR handbook.)\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn arrest means there was probable cause that a crime was committed. It doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a criminal charge was filed, or that a person was convicted.\nOut of curiosity, we took a look back two more years of arrest numbers, as well:\n\nThe FBI hasn\u2019t yet produced a full UCR report for 2018.\nNearly 18,000 city, university and college, county, state, tribal and federal law enforcement agencies participate in UCR. But the FBI notes that the UCR figures are estimates, because not all law enforcement agencies participate in the program.\nViews on why\nAs for why arrests for marijuana possession exceed those for violent crimes, we asked Michael Collins, director of national affairs for the Drug Policy Alliance, which works to change marijuana laws across the country. He told us it\u2019s because \"it\u2019s the easiest type of arrest to make; the evidence is already there.\"\u00a0\n\"They say marijuana is a gateway drug,\" Collins added. \"Marijuana is a gateway to the criminal justice system.\"\nSome police commanders say they have stepped up drug enforcement overall to tackle the opioid epidemic, and marijuana arrests are up accordingly, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. Other commanders assert that as more jurisdictions such as Philadelphia have begun treating marijuana with leniency, people have become more flagrant in its use, leading to more arrests.\nOur ruling\nBooker said, \"In 2017, we had more marijuana possession arrests in our country than all other violent crimes combined.\"\nFBI figures show 599,282 arrests nationwide for possession of marijuana and 518,617 arrests for violent crimes, which include murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, rape, robbery and aggravated assault.\nWe rate Booker\u2019s statement True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00446"}
