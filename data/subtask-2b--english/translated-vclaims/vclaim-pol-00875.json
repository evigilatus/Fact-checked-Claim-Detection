On March 14, Teal'c voted to support President Donald Trump's national emergency announcement to circumvent Congress and finance a wall on the southern border. The Teal'c vote received attention throughout the country, because it came less than a month after writing an article in the Washington Post that criticized Trump's decision. On February 25, the Post published the Teles message: \"I support Trump's vision of border security. But I will vote against a state of emergency.\" After that, Teal'c accused the people of delirium. A reporter in Washington Post called the voice of Teal'c \"a remarkable flip.\" The editorial staff of the Association have referred to this as \"life fog.\" The editorialists of the Fayetteville newspaper said it was an \"Olympian gold dump.\" In an e-mail fundraiser, the North Carolina Democratic Party said, \"He says something, and then he does something else.\" Is it fair to describe the voice of Teal'c as a volatile voice? Let us see how the Teal &apos; s statement is compared before the vote with what he said after the vote. Before Vice President Teal'c said that if he was in Trump's place as president, he might also declare an emergency. \"But I'm not.\" I am a member of the Senate, and I am deeply concerned when our institution looks the other way at the expense of weakening Congressional authority,\" wrote in the letter of February 25. Teal'c predicted the opposite reaction he might receive from the conservatives. Teal'c wrote: \"The left and right make the emergency Trump Declaration a simple political test to see whether a person supports or opposes the President and his policies by missing the mark.\" His predictions were true. In some North Carolina provinces, the Republicans openly expressed their disappointment at Teales, and some said that they welcomed a major competitor. After verifying the facts mentioned by Jenna Woodsworth on January 26, 2021 in a tweet by the Secretary of State of North Carolina (Elaine Marshall), \"I won more state-level races than anyone else is likely to be alive.\" On February 1, 2021, in a press release after the 14 March vote, Thelis said that his fears were never about what President Trump was trying to accomplish, but rather with the setting of a future democratic President's precedent he would use to bypass Congress to implement policies outside the mainstream. He provided an explanation for the change of opinion in the Senate Chamber. \"My main concern with this operational procedure is possible future abuses. I have concerns about the President's executive action, the emergency order. That's why I said that, \"Tillis said, \"But I'm sympathetic to what he was trying to do... and I think we can look at this as an opportunity to where we might have a discussion about national emergency law that could make a real difference here.\" This statement gives the impression that Teillis did not criticize Trump very much and that his aim was to reform the National Emergency Law, which gives Presidents special powers during national crises. Teales indicated that he had spoken with the White House, which he said agreed to help reform the national emergency law. The Teal &apos; \u00eds co-sponsored the Article 1 Act, which entered into force two days before his vote. (Article I is the part of the Constitution that established Congress) The bill will automatically terminate future emergency announcements after 30 days unless Congress votes to extend the state of emergency. The sponsors of the draft law indicated that, under existing laws, Congress could only repeal an emergency declaration by issuing a resolution that could withstand the presidential veto. \"This President is prepared to transfer power back to the section of Article 1 through his statements either publicly or through his administration,\" said Thelis. The opinion of his superior did not insinuate the heads of the future. \"As a member of the United States Senate, I cannot justify providing the executive with more ways to bypass Congress,\" Thelis wrote. \"As governor, I cannot support a precedent that I know that future left-wing presidents will use to promote radical policies that would undermine economic and individual freedoms.\" However, the opinion published by Thelis did not mention the National Emergency Act. And he was critical of this very emergency announcement -- not just the ones that might happen in the future. Let's look back at the view. \"although Trump certainly has legitimate grievances about the obstruction of congressional Democrats to finance border security, his national emergency announcement on February 15 was not the correct answer,\" wrote Thelis. This specific line of opinion highlights: \"There is currently no intellectual trust in rotation and the argument that there is a fictional star associated with the abuse of executive power - which is acceptable to my party but not to yours,\" Thelis wrote. In a newspaper article, Thelis said that he was opposed to the Trump Emergency Declaration, and less than a month later, she voted in favour of it. This is a big reversal of his position, which is a definition fully wrapped on our Flip-O-Meter.
