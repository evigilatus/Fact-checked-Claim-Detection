Donald Trump asked this classic question for the election year in his speech to accept the presidential candidacy of the Republicans at the National Congress of the Party in Cleveland. \"What about our economy?\" He asked. \"I'll tell you the simple facts that have been edited from your night news and the morning newspaper,\" follow. \"Almost four out of ten African-American children live in poverty, while 58 per cent of African-American youth are unemployed. Two million Latinos live in poverty today more than it was when the President was sworn in less than eight years ago. 14 million more people have left the entire workforce.\" There's a lot to unload there, but given Trump's interest in immigration from Mexico, we decided to focus on his claim that two million Latinos were poorer than when Obama took office. As has been shown, poverty among the population of Spanish origin was relatively stable in the Obama era. There is some literal accuracy of Tramp's allegations: according to census figures, some 10.9 million people of Spanish origin lived below the poverty line in 2008. Some 13.1 million Hispanics were in poverty in 2014, the last available year. This is a jump of about 2 million. But - and that's big, but - statistics are basically meaningless because the country's population of Spanish origin is also growing. The proportion of Hispanics living in poverty as a proportion of the total population of Hispanics is much more useful. According to this figure, poverty among Hispanics has not moved away from the path of Obama &apos; s presidency. The proportion was 23.2 per cent in 2008 and 23.6 per cent in 2014. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" By Samantha Buterman: 11 January 2021 Christopher Wimer and Laura Nolan of the Population Research Centre of Colombia Census data examine pre-tax cash income, while Nolan considers post-tax income and various other non-monetary sources of income for the poor, such as housing assistance and food stamps. According to their figures, the population of Spanish origin living in poverty in 2008 was approximately 12.3 million, rising to 14.5 million in 2014, representing a change of about 2 million. However, the poverty rate has barely increased from 25.8 per cent to 26 per cent. The Co-Director of the Centre for Poverty and Social Policy, Weimer, said that the Trump statement was \"technically correct but misleading.\" He also pointed out the importance of the fact that Obama took office in the midst of the Great Depression. Poverty usually grows during the recession. However, various economic recovery measures have helped to keep poverty under control, such as expanded food stamps, unemployment benefits and income tax exemptions. He said: \"It's not like poverty reduction, but (management recovery measures) he pinched the bleeding,\" he said. Our Governor Trump said, \"Two million Latinos live in poverty today more than it was when the President took the oath of office less than eight years ago.\" In fact, about 2 million people of Spanish origin live in poverty more than they did in the year that led to Obama's inauguration. However, these statistics are not meaningful because the number of people of Spanish origin has also increased. The poverty rate, which is much more useful statistically, was fairly stable throughout Obama &apos; s presidency, where it was just over 23 per cent. Therefore, the Tramp statement - that poverty among Hispanics has increased significantly under Obama's rule - is incorrect. Trump cherry chooses the growing total number without stating that the rate is stable. We value his claim half right. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/20f68f82-a61d-4509-958f-5f9052477536", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04641"}
