Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 18, 2018\n\n\nTrump might want to focus on collusion, but his blanket denial that he ever questioned Russian meddling runs up against his own words.\nEarly on, Trump treated any mention of Russian interference as an attack on the legitimacy of his victory.\nIn a May\u00a02017 interview with NBC\u2019s Lester Holt, Trump said \"this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story.\" Trump continued in that interview to say, \"It's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should've won.\"\nThat statement earned him PolitiFact\u2019s 2017 Lie of the Year.\nIn September 2017, when reports of Russian-backed Facebook ads came out, Trump tweeted, \"The Russia hoax continues, now it's ads on Facebook. What about the totally biased and dishonest Media coverage in favor of Crooked Hillary?\"\nThe Russia hoax continues, now it's ads on Facebook. What about the totally biased and dishonest Media coverage in favor of Crooked Hillary?\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 22, 2017\n\n\nWhen the Washington Post reported in December 2016 that the CIA had concluded that the Russians wanted to boost Trump\u2019s chances, Trump rejected it.\n\"We had a massive landslide victory, as you know, in the Electoral College,\" he said on Fox News Sunday on Dec. 11, 2016. \"I guess the final numbers are now at 306. She\u2019s down to a very low number. No, I don\u2019t believe that at all.\"\nIn a December 2016 interview with Time, Trump said two things: He didn\u2019t think Russia meddled, and that it might have.\n\"I don\u2019t believe they interfered,\" Trump said. \"That became a laughing point, not a talking point, a laughing point. Any time I do something, they say \u2018oh, Russia interfered.\u2019\"\nBut a moment later he said, \"I believe that it could have been Russia and it could have been any one of many other people. Sources or even individuals.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.

A reporter asked how Trump brought up the issue of Russian meddling in the U.S. election.\n\"Every time he sees me, he says, \u2018I didn't do that,\u2019 \" Trump said. \"And I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it.\"\nAsked again if he believed Putin, Trump called several top U.S. intelligence officials \"political hacks,\" and argued that other matters were more important.\n\"You have President Putin very strongly, vehemently says he had nothing to do with that,\" Trump said. \"Now, you\u2019re not going to get into an argument. You\u2019re going to start talking about Syria and the Ukraine.\"\nSo there are any number of occasions when Trump has denied Russian meddling across the board. But at other moments, he has acknowledged that it is possible.\nIn the same interview with NBC\u2019s Holt where he called the Russian thing \"a made-up story,\" Trump also suggested that Russia might try to shape U.S. elections.\n\"If Russia or anybody else is trying to interfere with our elections, I think it\u2019s a horrible thing and I want to get to the bottom of it,\" Trump said. \"And I want to make sure it will never, ever happen.\"\nAt a January 2017 news conference, he said he thought Russia did hack into the DNC, but he blurred the picture.\n\"As far as hacking, I think it was Russia,\" he said. \"But I think we also get hacked by other countries and other people.\"\nPressed on his apparent acceptance of the intelligence agencies\u2019 findings, Trump backpedaled.\n\"All right, but you know what, it could have been others also,\" Trump said.\nOur ruling\nTrump said that he \"never said that Russia did not meddle in the election.\"\nIn reality, he called the matter a \"made-up story,\" and a \"hoax.\" He has said that he believes Russian President Putin\u2019s denial of any Russian involvement. He told Time, \"I don\u2019t believe they (Russia) interfered.\"\nEven when he has acknowledged the possibility that the Russians interfered, he has added that it could have been other countries or even individuals.\nTrump\u2019s denial doesn\u2019t match what he has actually said.\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire!\n Share the Facts 2018-02-19 19:23:55 UTC   PolitiFact    1 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Pants on Fire  \"I never said Russia did not meddle in the election.\"     Donald Trump President of the United States https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/965202556204003328   In a tweet Sunday, February 18, 2018 2018-02-18    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02390"}
