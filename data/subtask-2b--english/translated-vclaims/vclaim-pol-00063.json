It's a fake.", "text": "An old video from a Republican political agent claiming that Corey Booker's money laundering as mayor of Newark in NJ has reappeared on Twitter. The video, originally posted on Facebook in September 2018, shows Roger Stone talking to the camera about poker, a Democratic Senator from New Jersey and a presidential candidate. Stone is an old political adviser to the Republicans and worked on the Donald Trump campaign in 2015. Sixty were accused of tampering with witnesses, obstructing justice and lying to Congress during the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 elections by former Special Prosecutor Rober Muller. He is denied access to social media pending a federal trial. \"As Mayor of Newark, Sun Curie Booker took $600,000 from the city's water authority and put it in his pocket. He said four different stories about it, \"Sutton said in the video. If Corey were a white Republican, he'd be in jail by now. A tweet from \"The Red Homeland Rising\" was published, copying the video and its title and published in October 6. It's been retweeted more than 7,000 times, so we wanted to check it out. We contacted Stone for the evidence he used to file his case against Booker. We'll update this story if we answer it. The old water scandal is the source of Stone's claim about poker that could be traced back to the corruption scandal involving Newark Watershed Conservation and Development. However, there is no evidence that Booker, who was mayor of Newark from 2006 to 2013, contributed to the bribery scheme. In 2014, a year after Booker left his post as mayor, the State Comptroller's report found \"a flagrant and preventable abuse of public funds\" in the watershed. The City of Newark delegated water management to the Agency through service contracts valued at approximately $10 million per year, but the report said that the Agency operated \"without any meaningful oversight.\" The Controller found that the Executive Director of the Watersheds (Linda Watkins-Brascher) had authorized \"risk investment activities in an account of the loss of more than $500,000 in public funds.\" In 2013, shortly after the observer first discovered the misuse of funds, the Agency dissolved. Watkins-Bracker was subsequently sentenced to more than eight years in federal prison for handing over $1 million worth of contracts to her friends and former husband. At least eight other persons associated with this scheme were also charged - but not before the Watershed Board of Trustees filed an action against Booker, Donald Payne Jr., D-N.J., and twenty-two others for their alleged roles in the waste of taxpayers &apos; funds. Related: recent statements by Corey Booker and the fact-finding blogs on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Act - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 On January 11, 2012, the prosecution claimed that the actions of the defendants, including the alleged embezzlement and waste of corporate property, led to the dissolution of the agency. At that time, Boker's lawyers said that the case had been mischaracterized as a barrier. N. J. Kom stated that he was the ex officio chairman of the Watershed Board of Trustees (who was the mayor), but never attended a meeting. The case claimed that the lack of oversight by poker had led to the mismanagement of the Agency. This was not approved by a federal judge, and in June 2016 a poker name was dropped from the lawsuit. The judge decided that Booker was immune from liability because his presidency was a function of mayor. \"Because there is no dispute that Booker was a public servant of the Council, nor is there any argument that his actions (or inaction) as a member of the Council were discretionary and/or legislative in nature and required the exercise of his ruling, the Court considers that Booker enjoys immunity under the law of N.J.S.A. Article 59:3.2 (a) and (b), \"Vincent Papala, United States bankruptcy judge, writes in the opinion. It appears that Stone took two stories about the old poker law firm and used them to overthrow a conspiracy about his involvement in the water scandal. The New York Post published the first story in 2013. She reported that the federal tax returns filed by Booker showed that he had received $689,500 in payments from the former Senate Attorney &apos; s Office, Trank Deepasquale, between 2007 and 2012, while he was Mayor of Newark. Booker had previously said that he had stopped working for the company in 2006, shortly after becoming mayor. The New York Post's poker spokespersons at the time told the New York Post that the money was not a salary, but was part of the \"segregation agreement\" with the company. The Daily Monster reported that the agreement was paid for the work that Booker did for the company before he became mayor. From 2010 to 2012, Booker reported his tax returns that he was \"physically involved in the operation of this work.\" A spokesman for Booker in the New York Post said that he had made a mistake with a tax preparer. The second story, published by Pol\u00edtico in January 2017, stated that Leonardo Webster, a long-time adviser to Booker, was the general counsel for watersheds while working in Trinc (while Poker was mayor). However, neither Booker nor he was charged with offences relating to the bribery scandal. According to the Post, as of 2013, Trinc had made US$212,318 from the watershed. This is one third of the alleged $600,000. Based on a review of current media reports and court records, there is no evidence of a money-laundering scheme involving both entities. The Poker presidential campaign did not respond to the request for comment. In a 2018 video, Roger Stone claimed that Corey Booker stole $600,000 from a city water authority and washed it through his law firm. The video recently appeared on Twitter. This claim is linked to a decade-long corruption scandal involving the Newark Watershed Conservation and Development Company, which was supervised by Booker as mayor and ex officio president. At least nine persons have been charged or sentenced in connection with the bribery plan. However, there is no evidence, based on court records and other existing reports, that the former mayor contributed to the scheme. With respect to the specific 60 claim, there is no general paper trail linking Booker to a former law firm, which is paid out of the water pool. Stone's using two separate facts to create a conspiracy. We assess his claim is wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00063"}
