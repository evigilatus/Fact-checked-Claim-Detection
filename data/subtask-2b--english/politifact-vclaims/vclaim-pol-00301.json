Back-and-forth ads between incumbent Mark Begich, a Democrat, and former Attorney General Dan Sullivan, a Republican frontrunner, have both slung accusations of Koch affiliation.\nA pro-Begich super PAC, Put Alaska First, fired the first shot in April. It released the ad \"Lost,\" which criticized Sullivan for not doing enough to prevent the Koch-owned refinery from closing, resulting in a loss of 80 jobs.\n\"Dan Sullivan remains silent about the jobs being lost here,\" the ad said. \"And those same billionaires, the Koch brothers, are supporting his campaign.\"\nThe next week Sullivan released a radio ad: \"Dan Sullivan has never taken a dime from the Koch brothers,\" the narrator said. \"It\u2019s Begich who has taken campaign cash from the Kochs.\"\nAs a Democrat, Begich wouldn\u2019t be a typical recipient of Koch funds. So we decided to fact-check whether the attack was accurate.\nOur colleagues at FactCheck.org pointed out that although Sullivan hasn\u2019t accepted money directly from the Koch brothers or their affiliates, the Koch-backed Americans For Prosperity\u00a0has\u00a0spent nearly $1 million on Begich attack ads. Sullivan isn't receiving those funds, but he does benefit from an attack on his opponent that can't be legally coordinated directly between the candidate and the group.\nAs for Begich, we found that KochPAC, a Koch Industries group, gave $5,000 to Begich\u2019s Great Land PAC back in 2010. Begich\u2019s PAC primarily gives money to candidates, as well as state and federal Democratic parties.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2010, the Kochs also gave money to Democratic senators like Mary Landrieu, Mark Pryor and Chuck Schumer. In 2013 and 2014, they haven\u2019t given any money to Democratic Senate candidates, and just three Democratic House candidates.\nA spokeswoman for the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, which runs OpenSecrets.org, said she\u2019d be surprised to see much Koch money going to Democrats this cycle.\nA Koch Industries spokesman told Politico in March 2014 that KochPAC doesn\u2019t base its donations on the candidate\u2019s party, but rather on the company\u2019s business and policy interests.\nOur ruling\nSullivan said Mark Begich \"has taken campaign cash from the Kochs\" but that Sullivan \"hasn\u2019t taken a dime.\" In 2010, KochPAC donated $5,000 to a Begich-affiliated PAC. But that's a modest amount by campaign-finance standards, and Begich hasn\u2019t received any more in the past four years.\nWhile Sullivan hasn\u2019t received money directly from the Kochs, he and Begich\u2019s other Republican challengers certainly benefit from the much larger TV ad buys by Koch-affiliated groups attacking the Democrat. A Koch-funded group, Americans For Prosperity, has spent nearly $1 million in Alaska benefiting Sullivan and other Republicans in the race.\nWe rate this claim Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00301"}
