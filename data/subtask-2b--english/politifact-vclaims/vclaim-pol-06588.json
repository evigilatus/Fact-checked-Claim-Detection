Scott Walker proposed a $300 million cut to the state\u2019s university system over two years, Democrats called it a \"massive\" and \"destructive\" blow.\nThat stuck in the craw Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, even though he thought Walker\u2019s plan cut too much.\n\"Let\u2019s remember that the cut that\u2019s happening under Gov. Walker is about the size of the one that happened under (Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle),\" Vos said March 12, 2015 in an interview on Wisconsin Eye.\nVos added: \"I didn\u2019t hear Democrats then complaining about the loss of the university and how the world was going to come to an end.\"\nVos was responding to a prediction from Assembly Minority Leader Peter Barca, D-Kenosha, that the university system would fall from the top ranks nationally for a generation under Walker\u2019s plan.\n(We rated Mostly True a Barca claim from the interview that \"the average faculty member at UW-Madison brings in close to a quarter million dollars a year\" in grant money).\nThe largest cut to higher education during Doyle\u2019s eight-year tenure came in his 2003-\u201905 budget, his first. That\u2019s the budget Vos was referring to said aide Kit Beyer. \u00a0\nFirst, the numbers.\nWalker\u2019s cut in state support, depending on how you tally it up, amounts to between $278 million and $297 million in the 2015-\u201917 budget.\nThe Doyle cut, approved by Republican lawmakers, was $250 million from 2003 to 2005.\nThe best comparison is the percentage view: Walker\u2019s cut amounts to between 12 percent and 13 percent of state general-fund aid to the university system; Doyle\u2019s was 12 percent.\nSo, as Vos said, the reductions were quite comparable.\nBut Vos\u2019 analysis skips past an important point. In 2003, Doyle and legislative Republicans allowed tuition to rise by 18 percent, or $150 million. That took a lot of the sting out of the budget cuts.\nIn contrast, Walker has again proposed a tuition freeze, blocking the university from turning to students or their families to backfill the budget.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow to the second part of Vos\u2019 claim, that Democrats didn\u2019t see the 2003 cut in the apocalyptic way they describe Walker\u2019s.\nWe reviewed news releases posted on WisPolitics.com and looked at news stories from that time.\nDemocrats did appear to lay off of Doyle\u2019s UW cuts, at least publicly.\nOne Milwaukee-area Democrat, state Rep. Sheldon Wasserman said:\n\"We're in a fiscal crisis. The truth is, I think the whole situation is not fair. At this point, although the university is being hit, when you're dealing with life and death (matters), it's a basic triage.\"\nThe same can\u2019t be said of UW administrators and student groups, both of whom pushed back pretty hard on the cuts and the tuition increase.\n\"We don't have too many friends in the Legislature, and I'd like to know why because we're not bad people doing bad things to the state,\" Linda Weimer, the UW System's vice president for university relations, was quoted as saying in a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story.\nVos focused on Democratic Party legislators in his claim, though, not on students or UW officials. And lawmakers and Doyle defended the cut, in part, by pointing out UW tuition rates were among the lowest in the Big 10 at the time.\nThere\u2019s one other piece of context worth noting when comparing Democratic reaction in 2003 and 2015.\nDoyle\u2019s 2003 cut was the first significant reduction in state support in years. The previous budget, under Gov. Scott McCallum, cut $12 million; the one before that actually increased state support. The fact that UW had been spared deep cuts in the years leading up to 2003 seemed to mute reaction from both parties to the big Doyle cut.\nBy contrast, under Walker, his proposed 2015-\u201917 reduction comes four years after cuts of $250 million to universities in his first budget (2011-\u201913).\nOur rating\nVos said Walker\u2019s proposed reduction in university spending is \"about the size of the one that happened\" under Doyle, but Democrats didn\u2019t treat that \u00a0cut as so dire.\nThe one cut Vos referred to, in 2003 under Doyle and legislators, was very similar in size to Walker\u2019s current proposal.\nIt\u2019s worth pointing out though that Doyle, unlike Walker, allowed big tuition hikes to ease the 2003 budget cuts, and that Walker has proposed deeper cuts in the UW System than Doyle in less time.\nWe rate the Vos claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06588"}
