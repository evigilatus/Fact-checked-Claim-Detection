The CDC believes the nurse, who had been taking CDC-mandated precautions, was exposed to Ebola because of a \"breach in protocol.\" \u00a0\nThe new case is fanning the fears of those who think the government is not doing enough to prevent an Ebola outbreak in the United States -- despite the CDC\u2019s repeated assurances that it is highly unlikely the disease would spread here.\nIn light of the news, the Sunday talk shows shifted from their scheduled topics to discuss the case. On CNN\u2019s State of the Union, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. -- invited on the show to talk about U.S. military activity in Iraq -- said it\u2019s not obvious to the public that anyone in the government is taking charge over Ebola.\n\"Americans have to be reassured here,\" McCain said on Oct. 12, 2014. \"I don\u2019t think we are comforted by the fact that we were told there would never be a case of Ebola in the United States, and obviously that\u2019s not correct.\"\nAt a press conference Sunday, CDC Director Dr. Thomas Frieden said there\u2019s a risk that the Dallas area might see additional cases in coming days because of this possible \"breach in protocol.\" However, the organization remains \"confident that wider spread in the community can be prevented.\"\nWe decided to look back and see if any official said that a case of Ebola would \"never\" come to the United States. Although many media outlets and health care officials have urged people not to panic about Ebola, we could not find a single instance where someone said it would \"never\" get here.\nAs far as we can tell, the CDC and the President Barack Obama\u2019s message has been the same throughout the epidemic, which began in Africa in December: It\u2019s possible a case might make its way to the United States, but a full-fledged outbreak is highly unlikely.\n(We reached out to McCain\u2019s staff, but they never got back to us.)\nThe administration\u2019s reasoning: America\u2019s health system is much better prepared to fight diseases like Ebola than those in places like Liberia and Sierra Leone, where the disease has been spreading.\nHere\u2019s some of the CDC\u2019s statements:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

And while it is unlikely that the disease would spread if the virus were detected in the United States, the CDC is taking action to alert health care workers in the U.S. and remind them how to isolate and test suspected patients while following strict infection control procedures.\"\n\n\nSept. 16, Obama\u2019s remarks at the CDC: \"First and foremost, I want the American people to know that our experts, here at the CDC and across our government, agree that the chances of an Ebola outbreak here in the United States are extremely low.\"\n\n\nOct. 8, Obama\u2019s statement to state and local officials, after Duncan (the first Dallas patient) died: \"Because we\u2019ve got a world-class medical system, because we\u2019ve put in place tough safety measures, because of the work that many of you have done in conjunction with organizations like the CDC and dealing with infectious disease generally, and because of the nature of Ebola and the fact that it\u2019s not something involving airborne transmission, the chance of an Ebola outbreak in the United States remains extremely low. \u2026 I\u2019m confident that so long as we work together, and we\u2019re operating with an appropriate sense of urgency that we will prevent an outbreak from happening here.\"\n\n\nThe common refrain in all those comments? A widespread outbreak is extremely unlikely in the United States. But individual or isolated cases were possible, hence the need for the CDC to be ready.\nOur ruling\nMcCain said, \"We were told there would never be a case of Ebola in the United States.\"\nBased on public statements, Obama and CDC officials have repeatedly said there\u2019s a chance an Ebola case could appear in the United States, but the possibility of an outbreak is extremely low. We found no instance in which an official said Ebola would \"never\" make it here -- rather, it has always been acknowledged as a possibility.\nWe rate McCain\u2019s claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07157"}
