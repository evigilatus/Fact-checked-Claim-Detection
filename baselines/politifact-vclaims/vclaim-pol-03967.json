FleishmanHillard is one of the most respected PR firms in the country, with big-name clients like Chevrolet, EA Sports, Olay and Procter & Gamble.\n\n\nThe Mission Continues paid FleishmanHillard $619,599 for its services in 2014 and 2015, according to public filings required by the charity.\n\n\nThis $619,599 made up approximately 5.2 percent of the organization\u2019s total expenses for each fiscal year.\n\n\nNews of the rebranding effort ran as a story in PR Week, an international trade publication for the public relations field.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 23, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBiden invested the entire family fortune in Ukraine gas and oil. Then shuts down Keystone pipeline. Starting to get the picture.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat they paid for\n\n\nGreitens\u2019 charity launched its new image to the public \"at a food bank event that brought veterans together with President (Barack) Obama, as they served meals to dozens of underprivileged families,\" according to the PR Week article.\n\n\nThe crown jewel of the nonprofit\u2019s new image was a new logo. It features a shield-shaped patch with a two-sided bird: an eagle to represent patriotism, and a dove to illustrate a commitment to service, as\u00a0explained by a video on the group\u2019s website. The logo won a Silver Anvil Award of Excellence from the Public Relations Society of America, a top trade organization for the industry.\n\n\nThe campaign also introduced a new website and introduced the branding into designs for community service projects.\n\n\nClearly, FleishmanHillard\u2019s campaign was designed to rebrand The Mission Continues as a charity, not Greitens himself.\n\nThis rebranding was covered by several major news outlets, including\u00a0ABCNews.com\u00a0and Bloomberg News.\n\n\nCharities have to market themselves so the people they want to help know about their services, said Daniel Borochoff, president and founder of Charity Watch.\n\n\n\"It\u2019s a legitimate expense,\" Borochoff said. \"They can\u2019t do it in the dark.\"\n\n\nA representative from the Greitens campaign said the ad was a blatant misrepresentation of the reality of the expense.\n\n\nOur ruling\n\n\nIn a TV ad, Koster said Greitens\u2019 charity The Mission Continues spent $600,000 on image consultants.\n\n\nThis amount was well-supported by non-profit Form 990s, which listed $619,599 in payment to PR firm FleishmanHillard.\n\n\nThe ad was misleading, however, when it suggested that the image consultants were used to craft Greiten\u2019s personal image, instead of The Mission Continues. Furthermore, it implied that a charity spending money on branding is wasteful. An expert who monitors charities said it was a legitimate expense.\n\n\nWe rate Koster\u2019s claim Half True.\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2c7b5353-dd89-4d1d-8e7c-b5a3c44e44ad", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03967"}
