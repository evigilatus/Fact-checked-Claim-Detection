In an interview with Bronx, N.Y., the rapper published on August 15, the senator answered questions posed by the approximately 50 million Cardi followers. After about a minute and a half of the video, Cardi Sanders asked about police brutality. \"We constantly see the brutality of the police against black men and against minorities in the social media,\" she said. \"What are we gonna do to change that? Because it discourages our people. We see our men killed every day, and it seems that no one cares, no one sympathizes, and no one talks about it.\" Sanders said, \"We have something like one in four black guys in this country that ends up in the criminal justice system. They may end up in jail, they may end up on parole, they may end up on probation.\" We didn't hear one in four statistics exactly how Sanders said it, so we decided to check it out. A spokesman for the Sanders campaign sent us three sources: a Gallup poll from 2013, a 2003 report from the Justice Statistics Office of the Ministry of Justice, and a 2018 report from the sentencing project, an organization advocating criminal justice reform. \u2022 None of these sources directly support his claim, although he speaks of the disparities in treatment that African Americans receive in the criminal justice system. \u2022 Our research found that federal crime statistics often do not include classifications by sex, age and race for adults. This makes it hard to tell how many young black men end up in the criminal justice system. \u2022 It is also complicated by the inaccuracy of the term \"small black men.\" It may refer to juveniles, to men under 25 years of age, or to 35 years of age. By talking about how one in four black men end up in the system, does it mean when they were young - or are they at the end of the road? Candace McCoy, a professor at the Criminal Justice Department of the Centre for Advanced Studies at the City University of New York, said that the phrase \"finished in the criminal justice system\" was ambiguous. An old study with the worst support for Sanders' claim results is the 2003 report from the Ministry of Justice - the second source sent to us by the Sanders campaign. The report estimates that black men born in 2001 had 32.2 per cent chance of going to prison during their lifetime, based on prison rates at the time. The probability was 11.3% for men in general. This figure applies to black men of all ages, so we have looked closely at the report for age data. It is estimated that some 681,000 black men between the ages of 18 and 34 in 2001 were imprisoned in state prison and federal prison during their lives. Census data show that there are some 4.3 million black men in this age group as of 2000, bringing the prison rate to about 15.7 per cent. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" By Samantha Buterman: January 11, 2021, one in three is about 16 years old. Since 2003, however, the imprisonment rates of black men have declined, giving greater credibility to what Sanders put in place, and Mark Mauer, Executive Director of the sentencing project, said. \"In spite of the lack of up-to-date analyses of how this affects the number \"one in three,\" it appears that \"one in four\" is a reasonable and conservative estimate of the current situation,\" according to Maur. Another way to read Sanders &apos; claim is to focus on the extent to which young black people are currently interacting with the criminal justice system. We found that federal crime statistics for black juveniles set lower crime rates than Saunders suggested. According to a data collection maintained by the National Centre for Juvenile Justice, the number of juvenile delinquency offences in 2017 was estimated at 212,000, including parole, among young blacks (generally defined as any person aged 17 years or under). According to United States census data, there were an estimated 5.25 million black men of 17 or less in 2017. This would make the crime rate for young black men about 8.7%. Remember, this does not take into account the proportion of young people who end up in the criminal justice system just the number of cases. There are other data on the overrepresentation of the black population in the criminal justice system, but not exactly what Sanders said. The spokesman for the Sanders campaign referred to an opinion poll conducted in Gallup on black men under 35 years of age. And I found that about 24% of black men say the police have treated them unjustly for the past 30 days. This does not substantiate Saunders' claim, so we have begun to figure out the crime rate figures for black men under the age of 35. However, as with juvenile data, there are not many federal statistics that calculate the crime rates of black men in that age group, making it difficult to confirm or deny Sanders &apos; statements. We wanted to take a look at the three areas that Sanders mentioned during his interview with Cardi: prisoners, probation and parole. We have also included prisoners, since the Ministry of Justice has age data for them. Prison population: Of the 456,300 black men in state and federal prisons in 2017, 44.4 per cent were between the ages of 18 and 34. Inmates: There were approximately 250,100 African Americans in local prisons. There is no further breakdown by age or sex. Under surveillance and parole: Of the 3.67 million adults under surveillance at the end of 2016, about 28 per cent were black. Of the 874,777 adults released on parole, this proportion of black adults was 38 per cent higher. There is no further breakdown by age or sex. \"One in four black young men in this country end up in the criminal justice system.\" We found that the senator's specific claim was not directly supported by federal crime statistics, whatever I read. However, it may be a reasonable estimate based on prison trends and older research on crime rates among black men. The Sanders statement is partially accurate but omits important details. We value it half right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00245"}
