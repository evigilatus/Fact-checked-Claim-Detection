Tony Evers and Attorney General Josh Cole are both Democrats. In December 2018, during the petty session, a series of bills supported by the People &apos; s Government were adopted with the aim of limiting some of the new administration &apos; s powers and signed by the outgoing Government. (Scott Walker) Senate bills 883, 884 and 886 have affected many authorities, including the Governor &apos; s ability to make changes to health care and public benefits programmes. Republic Jim Ott, R-Mequon, confirms that at least one thing has not been done. In an e-mail to voters sent in December, a headline for one point: \"An early vote has not been cancelled.\" The item noted that in the previous elections, large cities, including Milwaukee, Madison and Green Bay, had been offered an early vote of up to six weeks before election day - much longer than many smaller municipalities. Thus, KUFPEC claims that 884 degrees are in playground, since \"communities are now required to open two or more polling sites 24 hours a day, two weeks before an election.\" Is Ut right, the playground is even now? In one word, no. According to the Election Commission in Wisconsin, individual villages, towns and cities are responsible for setting the dates and hours of absentee personal voting for their municipalities. They still have this discretion, although the action taken by the General People &apos; s Assembly has reduced the length of early voting. Under these changes, voting cannot begin earlier than 14 days, or two weeks, after the elections. Voters can vote no later than Sunday prior to election day, providing 13 days of potential early voting, according to the Legislative Tax Office. The voting hours are still decided by local governments. So, contrary to what Ott alleged, this does not necessarily mean that polling places will operate 24 hours a day -- or even that a particular municipality will offer early voting at all. He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. \u2022 On January 12, 2021, in fact, there could still be wide contradictions within that window, so the playground is not even at all. When Ginger Muller was asked by Ot's office about the claim, she said that the wrong word had been used inadvertently. \"It should have been a reading... the municipalities are allowed to be...\" wrote in the e-mail. \"Thank you for drawing our attention.\" The Wisconsin Institute v. Thompson, the long-time election watch thing, was hot in Madison. In 2016, the Liberal Advocacy Group of the Wisconsin I Institute and the Citizens &apos; Action Fund of Wisconsin Education filed a lawsuit against the State Identity Card Act for voters. The case resulted in six separate legislative actions that United States Judge James Peterson considered unconstitutional - including the time limit for early personal voting except on Monday before election day. At that time, the newspaper Milwakee Journal Sentinel stated that Peterson called for restrictions on part of the early vote in a republican effort to strangle votes in order to achieve party gains and reject the GDP's claims that it wished to establish uniform rules for both rural and urban communities. Peterson also pointed out that limiting early voting would be detrimental to minority voters. In the original case, the plaintiffs filed a brief against the early voting limits of SB 884, requesting the State to enforce the previous Peterson injunction. The State rejected the request, stating that it lacked jurisdiction to enforce anything as long as the case was pending on appeal. Our classification in voter e-mail, Ott said a bill passed by the Republicans that would provide for early voting because \"communities are now required to open two or more polling sites 24 hours a day, two weeks before an election.\" But that's not what the law said. A maximum time limit of two weeks has been set for early voting. Each municipality was not required to show it to the entire window. Similarly, it did not specify that it would be open 24 hours a day. These decisions will continue to be made at the local level and therefore inconsistencies are likely to persist. We value or claim her wrong.
