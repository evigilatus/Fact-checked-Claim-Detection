At a private fundraising event in Missouri, Trump singled out a particular practice in Japan.\n\"It's called the bowling ball test. Do you know what that is?\" Trump said, according to a recording obtained by the Washington Post. \"That's where they take a bowling ball from 20 feet up in the air, and they drop it on the hood of the car. And if the hood dents, then the car doesn't qualify. Well, guess what, the roof dented a little bit, and they said, nope, this car doesn't qualify. It's horrible, the way we're treated. It's horrible.\"\nThe Washington Post noted, \"It was unclear what he was talking about.\"\nSo we wanted to look into it.\nWe asked the White House press office what Trump had in mind and got no comment. In her regular press briefing, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Trump was just joking.\nHowever, we found something that loosely fits what he described.\nThere are no bowling balls, and no 20-foot drop. But Japan\u2019s National Agency for Automotive Safety and Victim Aid does what\u2019s called a pedestrian head protection performance test. It\u2019s designed to measure the force someone\u2019s head would absorb if a car hit them.\nThis involves firing a carefully calibrated hemisphere-shaped device (so, more like half of a bowling ball) at the hood and windshield. The device records the force. Here\u2019s a graphic from the agency\u2019s website:\n\nNote that the largest head impactor is 4.5 kilograms, or about 10 pounds.\nSo, the details about a bowling ball, the weight and the height of the drop are all wrong.\nBut those details aside, Trump also got the purpose and nature of the test totally wrong.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen he said, \"If the hood dents, then the car doesn't qualify,\" that would be a test of the strength of the hood.\nIn contrast, the test is all about a person\u2019s head and the force it has to absorb in an accident.\n\"It\u2019s the complete opposite,\" said Sean Kane, president of Safety Research and Strategy, a private firm that studies vehicle and consumer product safety.\nIn fact, the more a hood dents or flexes, the better it is for the head of the unlucky pedestrian.\n\"It\u2019s akin to any other type of crash,\" Kane said. \"You look at cars today, and the impact damage to cars is much greater. There\u2019s a lot of crush, but that\u2019s to absorb the energy and keep it away from people.\"\nA biomedical engineering dissertation from Wayne State University made the same point: \"To lower head injury criterion, two main principles are necessary: provision of sufficient deformation space and provision of a low stiffness of the impacted vehicle body parts.\"\nHowever, Trump got one element correct. American cars sold in Japan, at least all models made this decade, have to meet the Japanese safety standard. So Trump was correct that this is a hurdle for American car makers.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Europe has a similar standard. In the early 2000s, the problem of cars hitting pedestrians was worse in Europe and Japan than in the United States. In Japan, for example, 27 percent of all traffic fatalities were pedestrians hit by cars. In the United States, it was 13 percent.\n\"The head impact test is a standardized test and has been there for many years,\" said Pankaj Mallick, professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Michigan-Dearborn. \"Our car companies are very much aware of this, but at this time, there are no National Highway Traffic Safety Administration requirements to do this test for qualification of a car hood.\"\nKane noted that the United States\u00a0stands out for having lower safety standards than Europe and Japan.\n\"If U.S. car makers wanted to make safer cars, they could sell them in both markets,\" he said. \"If they don\u2019t, that\u2019s a business decision.\"\nOur ruling\nTrump said that in Japan, \"they take a bowling ball from 20 feet up in the air and they drop it on the hood of the car. And if the hood dents, then the car doesn't qualify.\"\nAmerican cars must meet a Japanese standard. But Trump mangled the highly controlled process, which does not involve a bowling ball dropped from 20 feet.\nWhere Trump really goes astray is on the purpose of the test; he has it backward. It\u2019s not about seeing if the hood is strong. The more a hood gives way, the better it is for the head of a pedestrian. Trump\u2019s understanding of the test is so far off the mark, we rate this claim False.\n Share the Facts 2018-03-15 21:57:50 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  In Japan, \"they take a bowling ball from 20 feet up in the air and they drop it on the hood of the car.
