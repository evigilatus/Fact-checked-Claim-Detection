But claims wrongly blaming antifa activists for the demonstration are proliferating on social media \u2014 and some say they have proof.\n\"BOOM!\" one user posted on Facebook. \"IT HAS NOW BEEN CONFIRMED ANTIFA INFILTRATED THE TRUMP RALLY IN DC TODAY!!\"\nThe post shares a screenshot of a headline from a Jan. 6 Washington Times story: \"Facial recognition firm claims Antifa infiltrated Trump protesters who stormed Capitol.\"\u00a0\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe Washington Times story says that a \"retired military officer\" told the publication \"that the firm XRVision used its software to do facial recognition of protesters and matched two Philadelphia antifa members to two men inside the Senate.\"\nThe story doesn\u2019t include any images of protesters but the Times reported that \"the source provided the photo match to The Times\" and described them.\u00a0\n\"One has a tattoo that indicates he is a Stalinist sympathizer,\" the story says. \"XRVision also identified another man who, while not known to have antifa links, is someone who shows up at climate and Black Lives Matter protests in the West.\"\nWe emailed XRVision to ask about the claims and an attorney for the company responded with a statement from XRVision.\u00a0\nThe company denied generating \"any composites or detection imagery\" for the Times or a \"retired military officer.\"\nXRVision did analyze footage from yesterday and identified several people, whose identities the company shared with law enforcement, according to the statement.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt concluded that two of the men \"were affiliated with the Maryland Skinheads and the National Socialist Movements.\"\u00a0\n\"These are two known Nazi organizations, they are not Antifa,\" the statement said.\nPictures of these men were posted on the blog Philly Antifa, which describes itself as a site \"for all things Antifascist\" centered around Philadelphia. But the blog does not identify them as Philadelphia antifa members. Rather, it connects them to the Maryland Skinheads and the National Socialist Movement. (We\u2019ve written more about one of the men here.)\nThe third person XRVision identified was \"an actor with some QAnon promotion history,\" XRVision said. \"Again, no Antifa identification was made for him either.\"\u00a0\nWe\u2019ve already debunked a claim that this person was an \"Antifa thug.\" You can read that fact-check here.\nXRVision said in its statement that its lawyer had told the publication to retract the claims in its story and publish an apology. We reached out to the Washington Times about the statement and did not immediately receive a reply. But soon after, the story link redirected to the Washington Times homepage and appeared to have been pulled from the publication\u2019s website.\nThe publication later responded that it added a correction to the story, which was live again.\u00a0The correction said: \"An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that XRVision facial recognition software identified Antifa members among rioters who stormed the Capitol Wednesday. XRVision did not identify any Antifa members. The Washington Times apologizes to XRVision for the error.\"\u00a0\nWe rate the claim that XRVision\u2019s facial recognition \"confirmed antifa infiltrated the Trump rally\" False.\nUPDATE (Jan. 8, 2021): Following initial publication of this fact-check, the Washington Times responded to PolitiFact to say that it had corrected its story. We have updated this fact-check to reflect that change.\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click here, for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19132"}
