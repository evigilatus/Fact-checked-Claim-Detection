He did use the phrase \"dregs of society\u2019 during a 2018 speech at a Human Rights campaign event, but he wasn\u2019t talking about Trump supporters.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn the speech for the organization, which advocates for equality and the LGBTQ community, Biden cheered for a world that is \"open-minded and humane.\" He criticized the Trump administration \"and some of its most ardent right-wing supporters from the Ku Klux Klan\" and the \"alt-right\" who he said are trying to undermine the progress the country has made in achieving equality.\u00a0\u00a0\nAround the 20:12 mark, he said this (emphasis ours): \"And using religion or culture as a license to discriminate, demonizing the community and individuals to score political points, is no more justifiable around the world than it is here at home and our policies should reflect that. But despite losing in the courts and the court of public opinion, these forces of intolerance remain determined to undermine and roll back the progress you all have made. This time they, and not you, have an ally in the White House. This time they have an ally. They\u2019re a small percentage of the American people. Virulent people. Some of them the dregs of society. And instead of using the full might of the executive branch to secure justice, dignity, safety for all, the president uses the White House as a literal \u2014 literal \u2014\u00a0bully pulpit. Callously \u2014\u00a0callously \u2014\u00a0exerting his power over those who have little or none.\"\nBiden didn\u2019t say Trump supporters are the dregs of society. He was referring to a \"small percentage\" of Americans whom he describes as \"forces of intolerance\" oppressing the LGBTQ community.\u00a0\nWhile he did say that those people have an ally in the White House, Biden\u2019s comments, taken as a whole and not a soundbite, make it clear that he is not broadly targeting Americans who support the president. His focus is on people \u2014 including Trump \u2014\u00a0who he thinks unfairly target the LGBTQ community.\u00a0\nWe rate this claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18715"}
