Kearns, a Democrat who\u2019s running on the Republican line for Erie County clerk, says he has a history of standing up to leadership in government.\nKearns claims\u00a0in a television ad that he wasn\u2019t shy about calling out Sheldon Silver, who served as State Assembly speaker for two decades before his conviction on federal corruption charges in 2015.\n\"When I saw corruption and sexual harassment cover-ups I called on Sheldon Silver to resign,\" Kearns says in the ad.\nSome of his colleagues in the Assembly found it difficult to oppose Silver, even after his arrest.\nKearns says he didn\u2019t fall into that camp. Is that true?\nSexual harassment in the State Assembly\nKearns first called for Silver to resign in 2013. It was Kearns\u2019 first full year in the Assembly.\nKearns chose to conference with the Democratic majority in the Assembly when he first took office in 2012. That lasted about a year.\nThen news broke that Silver had helped cover up reports of sexual harassment in the State Assembly. A state ethics report accused former Assemblyman Vito Lopez of harassing at least eight women during his time in the chamber.\nThe report accused Silver and his staff of failing to properly investigate the sexual harassment claims against Lopez. Silver also approved a confidential settlement of more than $100,000 for two women who accused Lopez of harassment.\nWhen the ethics report was released, Kearns called for Silver to resign. He also left the Democratic conference in the Assembly.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColin Schmitt\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a news conference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have scientific data, from all different levels, but particularly from the high school sports levels, from numerous different states that shows that it is safe to play what New York is considering high-risk sports.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jill Terreri Ramos \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I am a father with a teenage daughter,\" Kearns wrote in The Buffalo News. \"I must ask, \u2018Would I trust my daughter\u2019s welfare under Sheldon Silver\u2019s leadership or supervision?\u2019 The record is clear beyond a reasonable doubt: The answer is \u2018no.\u2019 \"\nSilver\u2019s corruption charges\nKearns again called for Silver to resign in 2015.\nSilver was arrested on federal corruption charges in January 2015. Federal prosecutors accused Silver of using his position as speaker to accept millions of dollars worth of bribes and kickbacks.\nKearns, who never re-joined the Democratic conference, called for Silver\u2019s resignation the morning he was arrested.\n\"Secret settlements, sex scandals and now criminal allegations. All of the above should disqualify Silver from keeping leadership position,\" Kearns said in a tweet minutes after Silver\u2019s arrest.\nAt first, most Democratic Assembly members rallied behind Silver, their leader of two decades. Silver eventually stepped down after calls for his ouster mounted.\nKearns did not re-join the Democratic conference until Silver was convicted later that year. His conviction has since been overturned, but prosecutors are expected to bring a new case against the long-time assemblymember.\nOur ruling\nKearns said when he \"saw corruption and sexual harassment cover-ups I called on Sheldon Silver to resign.\"\nKearns first called on Silver to resign in 2013. He even left the Democratic conference because he did not support Silver as speaker. His position never changed.\nWe rate his claim as True.\n Share the Facts 2017-11-06 15:26:14 UTC   PolitiFact    6 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: True  \"When I saw corruption and sexual harassment cover-ups I called on Sheldon Silver to resign.\"    Michael P.
