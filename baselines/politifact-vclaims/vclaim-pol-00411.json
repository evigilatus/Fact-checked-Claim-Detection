Omar of Minnesota, a Muslim woman who came to the United States from Somalia as a child refugee. Trump accused her of being anti-Semitic.\nAt one point during the rally, Trump welcomed Republican NC Sen. Dan Bishop to the stage. And Bishop, who\u2019s running for Congress in North Carolina\u2019s 9th district, took the opportunity to tie his opponent to Omar.\nBishop said Dan McCready, his Democratic opponent, accepted a campaign donation from Omar.\n\"Dan McCready took money from Ilhan Omar,\" Bishop told the crowd.\nThat\u2019s not the whole story.\nDONATION RETURNED\nMcCready\u00a0received a $2,000 donation\u00a0from Omar on Nov. 6.\nBut then, earlier this year, McCready\u00a0returned that donation. He\u00a0tweeted\u00a0about the decision on April 17.\n\"Some folks are asking why I directed the return of Rep. Omar\u2019s donation. I did this weeks ago because I vigorously disagree with any anti-semitic comments. Since this time, dangerous and hateful attacks have started against her... \" McCready tweeted.\n\"I condemn in the strongest terms the hateful rhetoric against her, the Muslim community and people of color. Too many have been hurt by our broken politics. We must end hate speech against all people and groups.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden canceled the Keystone pipeline because Warren Buffett \u201cdonated $58 million\u201d to his campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOMAR\u2019S COMMENTS\nMcCready at the time didn\u2019t specify which of Omar\u2019s comments made him uncomfortable. But the\u00a0Los Angeles Times has chronicled\u00a0some of her controversial statements.\nEarlier this year, Omar apologized for tweeting in 2012 that \"Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel.\"\nIn February, Omar said supporters of Israel were only motivated by money. She tweeted, \"It\u2019s all about the Benjamins, baby!\" and later apologized.\nREACTION\nPolitiFact reached out to Bishop\u2019s campaign and asked why Bishop didn\u2019t mention McCready\u2019s decision to return Omar\u2019s donation. Jessica Proud, a spokeswoman for his campaign, suggested the action doesn\u2019t make a difference.\n\"Rep. Omar has a long and well-documented history of anti-Semitic remarks,\" Proud said in an email, referencing the 2012 tweet. \"So (McCready) should have never taken a cent from her in the first place.\"\nMcCready spokesman Matt Fried, contacted by PolitiFact Friday, said McCready would rather serve his community than wade into a hostile and unproductive debate.\n\"It\u2019s clear politicians in Washington have lost touch with the American values that define us as patriots and when they put hate \u2014 of any kind \u2014 above love for country, we damage this nation to its core,\" Fried said in an email. \"That\u2019s why on Wednesday Dan McCready was in Mint Hill announcing his\u00a0national service plan\u00a0and calling on more young Americans to serve their country, through the military like Dan did, or through civilian service like AmeriCorps.\"\nOUR RULING\nBishop said McCready \"took money from Ilhan Omar.\" Omar did donate to McCready\u2019s campaign last fall. But McCready returned the donation this spring.\nBishop didn\u2019t mention the returned money on stage, which could leave some Trump supporters believing McCready supports Omar\u2019s controversial comments. The claim is partly accurate but leaves out important details.
