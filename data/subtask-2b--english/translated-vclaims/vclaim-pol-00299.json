Murphy will take control of the Republic of Florida, the Republic of Marco Rubio, in one of the most controlled Senate battles in the country. In the announcement, the American Future Fund says, \"Patrick Murphy is named one of the least effective members of Congress in America.\" The fund is a non-profit political organization that doesn't have to reveal its donors and has spent millions of dollars on this election cycle. We will explain the basis for that allegation and the evidentiary shortcomings. (The Declaration also states that Murphy Shuh recorded his work in relation to being an accredited public accountant and a small business owner. We've verified similar attacks on his resume. The announcement refers to an arrangement within Goff for members of Congress, as well as the Tampa Bay Times blog about the arrangement. Indigov is a producer of Grapheq, a technology company that touches data. We have already explained this arrangement in a misleading attack by the major Murphy opponent, Orlando Republic, Alan Grayson U.S.A. Murphy was first elected in 2012. The \"IndiGov\" classification was published in August 2015 and covers only Murphy's term until 2014. That was when Murphy was a democratic junior with a small seniority in the Republican-controlled Congress. The calculation does not include bills submitted in the current 114th Congress (Jan. 3, 2015-Jan. 3, 2017) as time is still available for the enactment of bills. Vengov classified Murphy as the 21st less effective member. The list is full of rookies - 21 so-called \"less effective\" politicians who have served four years or less. It is also full of Democrats, the minority party in the House of Representatives since 2011. The main problem in this arrangement is that it is based on one measure: the percentage of invoices sponsored by each member over his or her tenure on the Commission. This is not a sufficient way to assess the effectiveness of a member of Congress. We have repeatedly been told by Congressional experts that there are many other ways to assess the effectiveness of a member until after the approval of a bill sponsored by the Committee. Members can include language in other bills, co-sponsored bills, hearings, negotiation of agreements, or provision of foundational services (e.g. assistance in obtaining social security benefits). One member may pass only one bill, but it may be a very important bill. Roy Myers, Professor of Political Science at the University of Maryland, called IndiGov's analysis \"film trash.\" \"It is a well-known fact that minority members of the House of Representatives are, of course, denied access to reports on their bills from committees controlled by their opponents.\" Myers said that among political scientists, the most sophisticated attempt was to assess the effectiveness of the legislator recently undertaken by Craig Volden, Professor of the University of Virginia, and Alan Weizman, Professor of the University of Vanderbilt. On January 13, 2021, Jake Taber stated in his remarks on CNN that Donald Trump's second presidential accusation was \"more isolated between the two parties in American history.\" Then the members &apos; professors compare the average grades compared to those of a similar party (majority or minority), the level of seniority, and the position of Chair (Chairman of the committee or subcommittee). In the 113th Congress, Patrick Murphy investigated 0.350. The average number of minority party members with seniority (re-employment period) is expected to be 0.391. So Murphy's a little below average, but he's close enough. \"So it meets expectations according to our standards,\" Volden said Politi Fact Florida. The Government of Trak, a website tracking legislation in Congress, publishes an annual report card containing classifications in different categories rather than just one. For example, Murphy was classified as not. 2 among the Democrats of the House of Representatives to write the draft laws of the two parties in 2015. \"We will never reduce effectiveness to one (and generally not make valuable judgements as to whether the organ is doing good or bad), said Josh Tabererer, founder of Guvatrak. \"Inside Goff's analysis shows a serious failure to understand how politics works.\" The Murphy campaign refers to cases in which he obtained Bill's language from the Commission as a freshman student. In May 2013, Murphy submitted the Human Resources Bill of 1974, which would have changed the way in which the Small Business Administration granted loans to businesses that had been rebuilt after a disaster. Instead of reporting Murphy outside the Committee, it was attached to Murphy with HR 4121 as an amendment along with other changes related to the Supreme Bar Association and sent from the Small Business Commission to the House of Representatives. No action has been taken on the draft law. In October 2013, Murphy co-sponsored and drafted Human Rights Bill No. 3329 on banking regulations. The Republican Party Blaine Lutmayer, R.M., was listed as a sponsor, but Murphy's campaign indicated that he and the Republic of Chile, Murre Cabito, R.W., had been listed as a sponsor. In Congress, Capito trusted Murphy to write the bill with Lutmeyer. The bill eventually became law. Rubio himself trusted in legislative victories by including language in other bills, so he considers this to be a measure of effectiveness. His campaign also cited examples of Murphy playing a role in the legislation adopted during the current session of Congress and not included in the IndinGov analysis. For example, in April, the House of Representatives unanimously passed the Law on Parity and Modernization in the Flood Insurance Market, introduced by Murphy and the United States Republic of America, Dennis Ross, R-Fla. The bill will allow competition in the flood insurance market. He has not yet obtained a vote in the Senate. Our announcement of the American Future Fund said \"Patrick Murphy was one of the least effective members of Congress in America.\" This is based on the arrangement of one group carefully considering Murphy &apos; s record by including the bills he has submitted that have been dropped from the Committee until 2014. Congressional experts have told us that there are many ways of influencing legislation and being an effective member that this analysis does not accommodate for only part of his tenure. The announcement also ignores the fact that Murphy, as a junior Democrat, had little chance of obtaining legislation through the Commission. The majority of members on the \"less effective\" list are new Democrats. Another analysis shows that he has met his expectations for a junior minority party. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that give a different impression. We're assessing this allegation mostly wrong. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/d7f3db04-9f93-4463-91ce-ba59c136883", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00299"}
