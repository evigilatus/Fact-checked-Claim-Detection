He introduces himself and then says, \"I\u2019m married to the next president of the United States.\"\u00a0\n\"Well, there it is,\" someone wrote, posting the video on Facebook on Oct. 21. \"Kamala\u2019s husband says \u2018I am the next president of the United States\u2019.... the cat is out of the bag ladies and gentlemen.\"\nOther users, including one of President Donald Trump\u2019s sons, Eric Trump, also recently shared the video.\u00a0\n\"Somebody let Jill Biden know,\" tweeted actor James Woods.\nTheir posts were flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

No one seen in the video is wearing a face covering, and they\u2019re sitting close together \u2014\u00a0 which is a clue that this video is old.\u00a0\nEmhoff himself posted it on Twitter on June 6, 2019, months before the first case of COVID-19 was reported. And back then, he was married to the person he hoped would be the next president of the United States. Harris, who ended her presidential campaign in December 2019, had not yet dropped out of the race.\u00a0\n\"This was such a cool moment at HQ,\" Emhoff said, referring to the Harris campaign headquarters. \"These folks have put their lives on hold, moved to Baltimore from all over the country, all to help elect @KamalaHarris. Really means so much to us.\"\nIt would be eight more months before Biden would tap Harris to be his running mate.\nEmhoff\u2019s quote is authentic, but it\u2019s not recent. This video is being reshared in a way that misleads viewers to believe otherwise.\u00a0\nWe rate these posts Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18753"}
