But the Affordable Care Act, adopted in 2010, relies largely on the free market, with employers continuing to provide health insurance to most Americans through private insurance companies. Indeed, a larger number of people will get private health coverage through the creation of insurance exchanges.\n\nBut Thompson\u2019s statement wasn\u2019t as sweeping. He charged that legislation backed by Baldwin would have the government \"take over your decisions\" on medicine, doctors and hospitals.\n\nSince it is clear Baldwin has supported going beyond \"Obamacare,\" that raises the question of whether Thompson\u2019s specific point could be accurate.\n\nThompson campaign spokeswoman Lisa Boothe cited two legislative efforts to back Thompson\u2019s statement, correctly pointing out that Baldwin supported Obama\u2019s reform law, even though it didn\u2019t go as far as she wanted, and that she supports a \"single-payer\" health care system.\n\nWe\u2019ll note that while Obama\u2019s law has been adopted (although not all features are yet in place), we can only speculate on the details of a single-payer health care system, since a single-payer system has not been adopted.\n\n\"Obamacare\": Boothe argued the reform law \"puts the government in between a patient and their doctor in Medicare.\"\n\nBut she didn\u2019t elaborate, other than to claim Obama is cutting Medicare funding (which PolitiFact Florida called Half True, given that his reform law reduces the growth of Medicare spending).\n\nBoothe also argued the law \"leaves an unaccountable board of 15 unelected bureaucrats in charge of rationing care and limiting access to health care.\"\n\nPolitiFact National has reported that while Obama\u2019s plan establishes a board to make recommendations about future savings, it does not outline a dramatic, structural overhaul of the program. Moreover, our colleagues have found, the board doesn\u2019t make decisions for individuals.\n\n\"Single-payer\": Single-payer refers to a health care system in which the government pays for all health care services but is not involved in the delivery of health care.\n\nBoothe argued that under single-payer, if, for example, \"an area has three different hospitals, the government could come in and dictate which one they will continue to fund.\" Or, she said, the government could decide not to fund religious-affiliated hospitals, \"thus removing you from your doctor and health care provider, and ultimately making decisions on your behalf.\"\n\nBut a system in which the government pays for all health care isn\u2019t the same as one in which the government \"will take over your decisions on medicine, on doctors and on hospitals.\"\n\nAnd Baldwin campaign spokesman John Kraus pointed out that a single-payer measure Baldwin introduced in 2009 would have allowed patients \"free choice of participating physicians and other clinicians, hospitals, and inpatient care facilities.\"\n\nHealth policy experts\n\nWe contacted three experts: George Washington University health policy professor Brian Biles; Georgetown University health systems administration professor Robert Friedland; and Baruch College health care policy professor Shoshanna Sofaer.\n\nNone was persuaded by Thompson\u2019s claim.\n\nOn the health care reform law\u2019s changes to Medicare, Biles said the law will put more people into private insurance plans, through the creation of \"exchanges,\" allowing them to choose from among private plans. Private insurers already limit access to certain doctor and hospital networks, as they did before the health reform law, and that isn\u2019t the government making decisions for a patient, he said.\n\nSofaer said virtually any physician in good standing and any accredited hospital can participate in Medicare, and that Obama\u2019s law does nothing to change that. The law also does not change what medications or medical services are covered by Medicare, she said.\n\nAnd while the Medicare advisory board is to recommend changes, said Friedland, \"the notion that this is somehow the government taking over your medical decisions or options is like saying employers are taking over your medical decisions by shopping for a better health insurance plan -- it does affect you; but it is hardly a case of your employer taking over your decisions.\"\n\nWith regard to a single-payer health care system, Biles said a single-payer system -- sometimes known as \"Medicare for all,\" a term Baldwin has used -- could increase the number of health care providers available to patients, given that the vast majority of providers accept Medicare patients.\n\nSofaer said that with the federal government paying for all health care, the government theoretically \"would have a huge amount of control over, in particular, what services were covered and which were not.\"\n\nBut \"in our form of government, with power divided in so many ways, I suspect it will be very difficult indeed for a federal program to be so authoritarian with respect to something as personal as medical care,\" she said. \"In practical terms, it would not happen.\"\n\nOur rating\n\nThompson said Baldwin supports a law \"in which government will take over your decisions on medicine, on doctors and on hospitals.\"\n\nHe provides no evidence that Obama\u2019s health care reform law would bring about such a change, and offers only speculation that such a change would occur under a single-payer system. Experts were unpersuaded by his claim.\n\nWe rate Thompson\u2019s statement False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10209"}
