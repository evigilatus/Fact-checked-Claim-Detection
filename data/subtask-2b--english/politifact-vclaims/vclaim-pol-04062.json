His pay went down--once.", "text": "An Austin Republican who talks up affordability says he's also repeatedly taken pay cuts.\nReally?\nGerald Daugherty\u2019s campaign website says: \"Leading by example, he has also taken an 8% pay decrease in each of the nine years he has been in office.\"\nThat\u2019s nine years in two chunks: Daugherty, a businessman, recaptured the Precinct 3 post on the Travis County Commissioners Court, representing western Travis County, in 2012 after losing the spot to a Democratic challenger in 2008. He faces Democrat David Holmes, a mediator, on the November 2016 ballot.\nConfirmed: Daugherty's smaller raises\nEarlier this year, we found Mostly False a candidate\u2019s claim that Daugherty had voted to raise his 2016 salary 19.6 percent.\nDaugherty had voted to adopt the county budget including pay raises for the four commissioners. Separately, though, he set his own increased salary at $93,000, which was $8,400 less than what the budget authorized for commissioners. For 2016 then, Daugherty\u2019s pay went up 3.2 percent from his 2015 salary of $90,109.\nFor that fact check, we also confirmed that while the county\u2019s 2015 budget provided for each of the commissioners to be paid $98,463, Daugherty was actually paid $90,109 that year, or 8.5 percent less than his colleagues, according to the county\u2019s 2015 actual expenditures data.\nWe also found that earlier, after Daugherty rejoined the body in 2013, he accepted a salary of $90,109 for fiscal 2013, according to his signed affidavit. At the time, that was about 5.7 percent less than the budgeted salary for each commissioner.\nPay cuts every year?\nFor this fact check, we wondered about the claim on Daugherty\u2019s campaign site that he\u2019s taken an 8 percent pay cut every year on the court.\nAsked to explain his claim, Daugherty said by phone that each time that he voted for annual county budgets including pay raises for commissioners, he followed up by directing the county to give him less of a raise. \"We make $103,000 this year, and I\u2019ve elected to take $93,000, which is probably more than 8 percent\" less, Daugherty said. \"What I do is, each year I take somewhere -- at least 8 percent\" less.\nDaugherty added: \"I have never voted to give myself a raise.\"\nHold that thought: Daugherty may not have voted for pay raises but he\u2019s accepted them--albeit in smaller increments than his colleagues. Also, records we obtained from the county\u2019s archival budget documents covering county fiscal years that begin in October of each preceding year mostly indicate he\u2019s not demanded actual pay cuts.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 23, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBiden invested the entire family fortune in Ukraine gas and oil. Then shuts down Keystone pipeline. Starting to get the picture.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe specifics: In 2003, when Daugherty won a special election to succeed Margaret Moore on the court, the salary for the Precinct 3 commissioner had already been set at $67,570, or 9.39 percent less than the court\u2019s adopted salary for that fiscal year of $73,915.\nIn 2004, Daugherty\u2019s salary shrunk to $66,523, for a 1.55 percent decrease. Our review indicates that was the only time Daugherty\u2019s salary went down from his previous year\u2019s pay during his stints on the court.\nRecords show Daugherty\u2019s salary stayed the same for 2005 before increasing by 2 percent, to $67,854, for 2006. For 2007, Daugherty\u2019s salary went up 13.29 percent, to $76,872 and for 2008, his pay increased by 3.4 percent, to $79,562 though a few months into that fiscal year, Daugherty relinquished his seat to Democrat Karen Huber, who defeated him at the polls.\nWhen Daugherty returned to the court in 2013, he elected to keep his salary at what Huber had been fielding, $90,109, through fiscal 2015.\nThis gets us to the years we covered in the previous fact check.\nWe also analyzed Daugherty\u2019s claim by his reasoning -- the idea that every year he\u2019s served, he\u2019s made sure to be paid 8 percent less than other commissioners. That holds up for each year of his interrupted tenure, we confirmed, with the exception of the year he returned to the court, fiscal 2013. That year, Daugherty\u2019s salary was 5.74 percent less than the court\u2019s adopted salary for commissioners.\nBy phone, Daugherty disputed the notion that he\u2019d said on his campaign site that every year he took an 8 percent pay cut.\n\"I guess you can read it however you want; I think it\u2019s pretty straightforward,\" Daugherty said. \"Each year whatever the salary is, I take, on\u00a0average, 8 percent less than that \u2026 some of this stuff you have to put in a bumper sticker kind of a size. You can get so verbose with it and get people so confused about \u2018what the hell is he saying?\u2019\n\"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s difficult to understand,\" Daugherty said. \"If people say, \u2018tell me what you mean by that,\u2019 well, the salary for 2016 and 2017 is $103,000. I\u2019ve signed an affidavit that I only want to be paid $93,000. And that\u2019s greater than 8 percent\" less, he said.\nOur ruling\nDaugherty says on his campaign site that he\u2019s \"taken an 8% pay decrease in each of the nine years he has been in office.\"\nAs a commissioner, Daugherty took a pay cut once. In fiscal 2004, his salary went down 1.55 percent to $66,523.\nDaugherty also has\u00a0consistently taken steps to ensure he\u2019s paid 8 percent less than fellow commissioners each year, though in one year his pay ran about 6 percent behind.\nOn balance, we rate this claim Half True.\n\nHALF TRUE \u2013 The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.
