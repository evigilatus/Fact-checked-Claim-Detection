We found that he accurately cited ICE numbers. But data also showed that the most common charges and convictions were for traffic offenses, immigration, and \"dangerous drugs.\" Pence\u2019s wording could leave the wrong impression that those criminal convictions were for more serious offenses.\nAt least 226,119 people were deported by ICE in fiscal year 2017, according to the agency. (Fiscal year 2017 started Oct. 1, 2016, so it included nearly four months of the Obama administration.)\nICE deported more people the year before, at 240,255. But ICE said the proportion of removals due to ICE arrests was greater in 2017 than in 2016. ICE\u2019s overall removal numbers account for people who were arrested by ICE inside of the country and people apprehended at the border and turned over to ICE for removal.\n\nPence\u2019s number of people arrested by ICE checks out with the agency\u2019s data \u2014 of 143,470 administrative arrests, nearly 128,000 had criminal convictions or pending criminal charges.\nAdministrative arrests are arrests of people who were either present in the country illegally or had somehow violated the terms of their entry/status, an ICE spokeswoman said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of those arrests:\n\u2022 Criminal convictions: 105,736\n\u2022 Pending criminal charges: 22,256\n\u2022 No known criminal charges or convictions: 15,478\nA criminal conviction or charge for breaking an American law covers a broad category.
