The White House did not respond to a request for comment.\nDifferences in family separations by Obama and Trump\nThe Justice Department in April introduced \"zero-tolerance\" as a new policy under the Trump administration, not as one\u00a0carried over from past administrations. The policy called for the prosecution of all adults who were referred by immigration authorities for violating immigration laws.\nAs a consequence of the policy,\u00a0more than 2,300 immigrant children were separated from their parents as they arrived at the border this summer. Children were put into the custody of U.S. Health and Human Services and the parents referred for prosecution.\nPast administrations also separated children from the adults they arrived with in the United States. But immigration experts said those separations were relatively rare and nowhere near the scale under the Trump administration.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees border enforcement, told PolitiFact that Obama\u2019s administration did not count the number of families separated at the border.\nThe Obama administration began prosecuting border-crossers who had already been deported at least once, but very few of them crossed with children, so it didn\u2019t become as visible an issue, Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute, told us for a previous fact-check.\n\"There was some child separation and some pushback by immigrant advocacy groups around that, but the numbers were quite limited,\" Seele said.\nWhile Obama\u2019s administration generally refrained from prosecuting adults who crossed the border with their children, the Trump administration chose to prosecute adults, even when they had kids with them, said Peter Margulies, an immigration law and national security law professor at Roger Williams University School of Law, in June.\n\"That's a choice \u2014 one fundamentally different from the choice made by both Obama and previous presidents of both parties,\" Margulies said.\nThe George W. Bush administration had a program, Operation Streamline, that referred immigrants who crossed into the country illegally for prosecution, but it made exceptions for adults traveling with children.\nTrump\u2019s tweet also claimed that family separations were done \"because that is the policy and law.\"\nThere is no law requiring that all families be separated once they cross the border. DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen in June tweeted, \"We do not have a policy of separating families at the border. \u00a0Period.\" The \"zero-tolerance\" policy did not explicitly say parents and children had to be separated, but that was the result of parents being referred for prosecution.\nKatie Waldman, a DHS spokeswoman, told PolitiFact that families are separated for one of three reasons:\u00a0when officials\u00a0cannot establish the custodial relationship, when they\u00a0believe the custodian may be a threat to the child, or when the custodian is being detained for prosecution.\nTrump also claimed that he \"tried to keep them together.\" Trump in June insisted that he didn\u2019t have the executive power to end family separations \u2014\u00a0but he later did just that after mounting pressure and criticism over the separations. We rated Trump\u2019s claim that he couldn\u2019t end family separations a Full Flop.\nOur ruling\nTweeting about family separations at the border, Trump claimed, \"we had the exact same policy as the Obama administration.\"\nThat\u2019s not true. Families were separated at the border as a result of a new Trump policy called \"zero-tolerance.\" There were some family separations under the Obama administration, but experts say not at the scale of the Trump administration's and that they were relatively rare.\nWe rate Trump\u2019s statement False.\n Share the Facts 2018-11-29 19:42:13 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  Says of immigrant family separations at the border, \"we had the exact same policy as the Obama administration.\"    Donald Trump President of the United States    in a tweet Sunday, November 25, 2018 2018-11-25    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01234"}
