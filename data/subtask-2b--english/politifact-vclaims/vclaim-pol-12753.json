They only pave the way for a court battle, should the law ultimately be ruled constitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n\"Does it allow Floridians to opt out if it\u2019s successful? Yes,\" said Christie Herrara, director of ALEC\u2019s health task force. \"A lawsuit would have to be filed.\"\n\nThe \"opt out,\" in that case, would come as the result of a legal challenge by states that would argue their constitutions prohibit the implementation of the federal health care law.\n\nBut it\u2019s a long shot any federal court would side with the states\u2019 argument.\n\n\"There is a whole body of case law that is very consistent,\" said Barry Richard, a Tallahassee-based constitutional law attorney who represented George W. Bush in the 2000 vote recount. \"This is not a close call.\"\n\nLawyers and legal scholars say the states\u2019 challenge would be tossed aside because of Article VI of the U.S. Constitution, and a paragraph known as the supremacy clause.\n\nSpecifically, the clause states that the U.S. Constitution, and federal treaties and laws are the \"supreme Law of the Land.\" It requires state judges to follow federal law in any conflict with state laws or constitutions.\n\nIn this situation, the federal law requires that people have health insurance, a provision commonly called the \"individual mandate.\"\n\nHaridopolos\u2019 amendment to the Florida Constitution would prohibit laws that compel people to have health care coverage.\n\n\"This is precisely what the supremacy clause was meant to deal with, when you have the federal government saying one thing and the state saying something else,\" said Mike Allen, a constitutional law professor at Stetson University in Gulfport.\n\nIt would be impossible to comply with both laws at once, he said. And in such instances, he said, the federal law almost always wins.\n\nThat\u2019s necessary, says Steve Valdeck, a law professor at American University, to preserve the structure of the U.S. government.\n\n\"I think we have settled the question that the Constitution makes the federal government supreme over the states. If one state could decide on its own they want to withdraw from a federal law, there\u2019s nothing to stop other states from doing it,\" Valdeck said. \"Pretty soon you\u2019ve destroyed the central premise on which our country is founded, which is a central federal government.\"\n\nNow there is one scenario in which Haridopolos\u2019 amendment could protect Floridians from an individual mandate.\n\nIf the U.S. Supreme Court ultimately rules in favor of the 26 states suing to stop implementation of the individual mandate, Florida\u2019s constitutional amendment would be moot as far as federal health care reform is concerned.\n\nBut, the state constitutional amendment would prohibit future state Legislatures from enacting an individual mandate if they ever decide to put forward their own health care plan, as Massachusetts did.\n\nBut Haridopolos didn\u2019t mention protecting Floridians from a state law. He referred specifically to Obama and the federal law.\n\nBottom line: All the state constitutional amendment guarantees is standing for a lawsuit against the federal government. Floridians could only \"opt out\" of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate if the U.S. Supreme Court rules against the supremacy of the federal law.\n\nThat\u2019s a major, gigantic if. There\u2019s at least a remote enough chance that the court would rule in favor of Florida in a lawsuit, so Haridopolos\u2019 statement doesn\u2019t warrant a Pants On Fire ruling. However, it\u2019s clearly False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Steineke\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembly Republicans \u201chave come to the table\u201d and were part of \u201cgive and take\u201d compromise on a coronavirus bill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 27, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-12753"}
