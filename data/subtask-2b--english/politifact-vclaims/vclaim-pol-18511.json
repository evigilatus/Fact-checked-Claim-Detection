To prevent fraud official ballots had been printed with an invisible, unbreakable code watermark and registered on a Quantum Blockchain System.\n\"As of this writing, in five states 14 million ballots had been put through a laser scanner - 78% of which failed because there was no watermark to verify the ballot. Of those that failed 100% had checked for Biden.\n\"An initial test showed that according to water marks on validated ballots fed into the Quantum Computer, Trump won re-election by over 80% of the legal ballot cast. The final validated vote tallied in that test: Trump 73.5 million votes to Biden's 25.9 million - and that didn't even account for Trump votes that people observed being tossed and never accounted for.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

The other criteria is that the stories can't be commercially motivated in the news area. We do accept commercial stories in our promotional area only. You can post event notices, press releases and promotional stories, but we ask that those are placed in their respective areas.\"\nThe National Guard recount story is a different version of a QAnon-related conspiracy theory that baselessly claimed the Trump administration, with the help of the Department of Homeland Security, secretly watermarked official ballots to set up Democrats (who allegedly aimed to cheat).\nThe federal government has no role in designing, printing or auditing ballots \u2014 the responsibility lies with state and local governments \u2014 and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which is overseen by the Department of Homeland Security, said there is no truth to the rumor.\nThe National Guard also told PolitiFact that it is not taking part in a nationwide ballot recount and said any election support it may provide is state-led and governor-driven.\nEach state can tailor its National Guard forces to specific requirements to support elections, said National Guard spokesperson Army Master Sgt. W. Michael Houk.\n\"Governors have authority to activate their NG in State Active Duty to provide timely assistance in accordance with State law. If authorized, National Guard missions may include cyber support, logistical and administrative support, setting up polling stations, COVID-19 screening, and managing crowd flow,\" Houk said in an email to PolitiFact. \"There are currently no National Guard men and women on duty for election support. The information you present suggests federal control of a state\u2019s National Guard, which would not be the case.\"\nWe rate this post Pants on Fire!\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections FactChat #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click here, for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18511"}
