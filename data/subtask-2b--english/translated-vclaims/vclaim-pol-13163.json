Novziger, quoted from the Novziger case in the \"Voice Guide\" just published by the Association of Women Voters of the Austin Region: \"At present, no one from South Austin is in the House of Austin.\" We left the message of Novziger, a member of the Council from mid 1987 to mid-1996, and then read a newspaper article in January 23 Austin American - a statesman who supports his claim. The story revealed the desire of the Mayor of Austin Li of Venguel to seek the reorganization of the Council with the consent of the electorate, which resulted in the election of six members from the regional provinces as well as two members, and the election of the mayor throughout the city. At present, the story says, \"Three members of the Council live in or near the centre of the city, two live in East Austin, one live in Hyde Park, and Levil lives in the northwest.\" The story goes on: \"No one lives south\" of the Colorado River, which separates South Austin from the rest of the city. After that, we called Matt Curtis, the mayor's contact manager, who told us that no one had moved since the article was published. Curtis said that Levingwell lives in Bloquence Drive in West Austin. Among the other board members, Cheryl Cole lives in Wilshire Woods, Laura Morrison lives in Old West Austin, Chris Riley is downtown, Randy Chad lives in Clarksville and Bill Spellman from Hyde Park. Councilman Mike Martinez told us that he lives in the Senate, part of East Austin, but plans to move later this year to East 11th Street, near Chekon. Curtis said that the last South Austinites on the board, Betty Dunkerley and Jennifer Kim, finished their term in June 2008. When we closed this check, Novziger called to say that he first heard from local activists that the council now lacks residents of South Austin. We're assessing his statement right.
