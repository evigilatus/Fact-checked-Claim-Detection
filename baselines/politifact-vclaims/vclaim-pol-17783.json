We reached out to the original poster for a comment, but they haven\u2019t responded.\n\n(Screenshot from Facebook)\nAntifa stands for \"anti-fascist.\" It\u2019s a broad, loosely affiliated coalition of left-wing activists that\u2019s been around for decades and had a resurgence since the election of President Donald Trump. Republicans have blamed antifa activists for the violent protests that erupted after the death of George Floyd in late May.\nVersions of the Facebook post have been circulating since at least November 2019, according to the Associated Press. They\u2019ve been shared widely in pro-Trump and conservative groups since June, according to CrowdTangle, a social media insights tool owned by Facebook.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe previously reported that antifa is not a designated terrorist organization.

And it\u2019s unclear to what extent antifa was involved in violent protests against police brutality.\nWe reached out to the FBI for a comment, but we haven\u2019t heard back. The agency told the AP that its focus is \"not on membership in particular groups but on individuals who commit violence.\"\nThere is evidence that, in general, teachers\u2019 political views skew left. But we could find nothing to back up the claim that they are overrepresented in the antifa movement.\nWe rate the Facebook post Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17783"}
