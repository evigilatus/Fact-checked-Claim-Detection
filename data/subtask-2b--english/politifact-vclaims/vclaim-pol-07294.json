To get that figure, she divided the number of intimate partner homicides with female victims (1,192) by the number of days in the year. More than three days a day is alarmingly high, but it\u2019s also down from a recent high of 4.2 deaths per day in 1993.\nRennison did not run a similar calculation for the most recent years available, 2011 and 2012, but the trend holds.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in remarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, this is a daily average and not an exact representation of how many women are killed by their current or former partners.\n\"So strictly scientifically speaking, it is a risk to estimate how many people have been killed in domestic violence incidents since Feb. 15,\" said Mary Koss, University of Arizona public health professor. \"However, doing so is not fundamentally wrong and crime experts do it frequently.\"\nBecause the number of male victims in intimate partner homicides is much lower, so too is the daily average. There were 305 of these deaths in 2010, which amounts to a daily average of 0.84.\nJames Fox, a Northeastern University criminology professor, sliced the data differently for his own count of intimate partner homicides. He factored in unsolved homicide cases believed to have involved intimate partners. The result: slightly higher deaths per year.\nUsing his numbers,the daily average of female deaths was 3.84 in 2010, 3.61 in 2011, and 3.68 in 2012.\nBrown could have been a touch more precise with his wording by saying \"partners and former partners\" instead of just \"partners,\" but Rennison says that level of distinction is probably more important to academics.\n\"Generally when we talk in our field (about FBI or Bureau of Justice Statistics figures), we\u2019re talking about current or former spouse, girlfriend or boyfriend, and it can include same-sex partners as well,\" she said.\nOur ruling\nBrown implored the NFL community and beyond to consider a shocking statistic: \"According to domestic violence experts, more than three women per day lose their lives at the hands of their partners.\"\nHe went on to estimate how many women have been killed by their partners since the day Rice attacked his now-wife in an elevator -- a practice experts said isn\u2019t scientifically precise but is a common practice.\nAs for the three-deaths-a-day figure itself, experts said it is accurate. By some measures, the daily average is actually closer to four deaths.\nThere are some ways that Brown could have been more precise, but they do not obscure his point.
