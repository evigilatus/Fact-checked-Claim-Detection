The first cases were found in Mexico before rapidly spreading around the world. The U.S. declared a public health emergency on April 26, and President Barack Obama upped that to a national emergency in late October.\u00a0\nBiden went on the Today Show on April 30, 2009, to talk about the outbreak.\nThen-host Matt Lauer asked Biden, \"If a member of your family came to you and said, 'Look, I want to go on a commercial airliner to Mexico and back,' within the next week, would you think it's a good idea?\"\nBiden said he would tell them not to be in a confined place, and he gave his reason.\n\"It's not that it's going to Mexico, it's you're in a confined aircraft,\" Biden said. \"When one person sneezes it goes all the way through the aircraft.\"\nHe said he would not suggest taking the subway, either. \"If you're out in the middle of a field and someone sneezes, that's one thing; if you're in a closed aircraft or closed container or closed car or closed classroom, it's a different thing.\"\nBiden\u2019s comment drew criticism over fear-mongering, particularly from the travel industry, and experts told us Biden got it wrong.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn our 2009 fact-check, we consulted Dr. Tony Overfelt from Auburn University\u2019s National Air Transportation Center, which specializes in studying aircraft environment. At the time, Overfelt said that the air in a commercial jet flows from vents above passengers' heads to vents in the floor at their feet. That airflow sends particles down to the floor and into the aircraft's filtration system.\nThe particles from a sneeze \"might travel a row or a couple of rows or something like that,\" Overfelt said. \"They're really not going to travel up and down the airplane as our vice president said.\"\u00a0\nHow the administration responded\nThe tweet said the Obama administration had to \"clean up\" Biden\u2019s mess and \"apologize for his ineptitude.\"\nThere was cleanup, including a half-hearted apology if anyone was \"unduly alarmed.\"\nA spokesperson for Biden\u2019s office released a statement hours later to clarify what he said. They said Biden\u2019s advice lined up with the administration\u2019s: that people should avoid unnecessary air travel to and from Mexico.\u00a0\n\"If they are sick, they should avoid airplanes and other confined public spaces, such as subways,\" the statement said. \"This is the advice the vice president has given family members who are traveling by commercial airline this week.\"\nBiden\u2019s presidential campaign declined to comment.\nAs shown in the Trump Warm Room tweet, White House press secretary Robert Gibbs responded to Biden\u2019s remark in the White House briefing.\n\"I think what the vice president meant to say was the same thing that, again, many members have said in the last few days, and that is, if you feel sick, if you are exhibiting symptoms, flu-like symptoms \u2014 coughing, sneezing, runny nose \u2014 that you should take precautions, that you should limit your travel,\" Gibbs said on April 30.\nA reporter then says that wasn\u2019t \"remotely close\" to what Biden said, to which Gibbs responded:\u00a0\n\"I understand what he said and I'm telling you what he meant to say ... Obviously if anybody was unduly alarmed for whatever reason, we would apologize for that and I hope that my remarks and remarks of the people of the CDC and Secretary Napolitano have appropriately cleared up what he meant to say.\"\nOur ruling\nA Twitter account run by the Trump campaign tweeted that, during the 2009 swine flu outbreak, Biden made \"reckless comments\" unsupported by science and the Obama Administration had to clean up the mess and apologize for it.\u00a0\nDuring a television interview, Biden said he would advise his family not to travel in confined places, and claimed that when one person sneezes \"it goes all the way through an aircraft.\"\nHis comments were met with backlash for inducing fear, and his spokesperson issued a statement to clarify his words. Experts said the statement on how germs travel was inaccurate.\nThe claim is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18115"}
