1	Donald Trump	Well, thank you very much.
2	Donald Trump	Special place.
3	Donald Trump	Really special place.
4	Donald Trump	But where I'm disappointed: I said, "We could have had 25,000 people if we did it outside."
5	Donald Trump	They said -- Did you see all the people outside?
6	Donald Trump	They all want your seat.
7	Donald Trump	That's the way life goes.
8	Donald Trump	And you're not giving it up.
9	Donald Trump	I know you too well.
10	Donald Trump	You're not going to give it up.
11	Donald Trump	Please sit down.
12	Donald Trump	Let's enjoy it.
13	Donald Trump	Let's enjoy ourselves.
14	Donald Trump	[Audience member calls "We love you, President Trump"]
15	Donald Trump	No, you got tremendous crowds out there -- thank you.
16	Donald Trump	I love your leg.
17	Donald Trump	Look at that, he has my name tattooed on his leg.
18	Donald Trump	How did you get to The Villages?
19	Donald Trump	How do you get to The Villages?
20	Donald Trump	Huh?
21	Donald Trump	That's great.
22	Donald Trump	But I'm thrilled to be here in one of the most famous and thriving communities anywhere in Florida, and really anywhere in the world, as far as I'm concerned -- The Villages.
23	Donald Trump	In fact, I was thinking about moving to The Villages, but I just couldn't leave Mar-a-Lago.
24	Donald Trump	I couldn't leave it.
25	Donald Trump	[Laughter] I got stuck at Mar-a-Lago.
26	Donald Trump	I don't know.
27	Donald Trump	But this has been a great area for us, and it's been a great part of our victory.
28	Donald Trump	I don't know if we got 100 percent, Ron, but it was pretty close, right?
29	Donald Trump	Anybody in there didn't vote for us, right?
30	Donald Trump	No, we love it.
31	Donald Trump	And we met the folks that built The Villages and that run The Villages, and they're out here someplace.
32	Donald Trump	And they've done a fantastic job.
33	Donald Trump	Where are they?
34	Donald Trump	Where -- they're here some place.
35	Donald Trump	Stand up, please.
36	Donald Trump	What a job you've done.
37	Donald Trump	Great job.
38	Donald Trump	Great job.
39	Donald Trump	And that was started with your grandfather and your father and you folks.
40	Donald Trump	And what a great job you've done.
41	Donald Trump	You know, in my old days, I would have been jealous.
42	Donald Trump	Now I couldn't care less about them.
43	Donald Trump	[Laughter] It's amazing.
44	Donald Trump	It's amazing how being President can do that to you.
45	Donald Trump	[Laughter] So in my campaign for President, I made you a sacred pledge that I would strengthen, protect, and defend Medicare for all of our senior citizens.
46	Donald Trump	And you see it's under siege, but it's not going to happen.
47	Donald Trump	Today, I will sign a very historic executive order that does exactly that: We are making your Medicare even better, and we are not letting anyone -- it will never be taken away from you.
48	Donald Trump	We're not letting anyone get close.
49	Donald Trump	You see these people on the other side?
50	Donald Trump	These people are crazy, by the way.
51	Donald Trump	They're totally crazy.
52	Donald Trump	[Laughter] But they want to take it away and give you lousy healthcare.
53	Donald Trump	It's pretty incredible.
54	Donald Trump	You want to keep your doctors, right?
55	Donald Trump	Remember, with Obama -- President Obama, right?
56	Donald Trump	He said, "You can keep your doctor.
57	Donald Trump	You can keep your plan."
58	Donald Trump	That didn't work out too well for the people.
59	Donald Trump	[Audience Boos, Audience member calls "We're trying to forget"]
60	Donald Trump	Twenty-eight times.
61	Donald Trump	He said he's trying to forget.
62	Donald Trump	[Laughter] You better never forget, okay?
63	Donald Trump	Never forget.
64	Donald Trump	As long as I'm President, no one will lay a hand on your Medicare benefits.
65	Donald Trump	And that's what we're here to do today.
66	Donald Trump	This order is the latest step in my administration's drive to ensure the world's best healthcare for all Americans.
67	Donald Trump	Together, we're creating a healthcare system that protects vulnerable patients, makes healthcare more affordable, gives you more choice and control, and delivers the high-quality care Americans deserve.
68	Donald Trump	And that's what we're doing -- we're strengthening our healthcare system to a level that nobody thought would be possible.
69	Donald Trump	Our economy is booming.
70	Donald Trump	We're doing fantastically well.
71	Donald Trump	I think it gets a little bit hurt by politics.
72	Donald Trump	But our country is so strong and our economy is so powerful that even politics, and even when you have the -- the "Do-Nothings" -- I call them the -- really, the "Do-Nothing Dems."
73	Donald Trump	They can't even affect it very much.
74	Donald Trump	We've created over 6 million new jobs since the election.
75	Donald Trump	The unemployment rate has reached a 51-year low.
76	Donald Trump	Two point -- think of that.
77	Donald Trump	Think of that.
78	Donald Trump	Then, soon, it's going to be a historic number, like so many of the other numbers.
79	Donald Trump	2.5 million people have been lifted out of poverty.
80	Donald Trump	That means more Americans that now have -- and that's what it's all about -- they have a great way of life.
81	Donald Trump	They have affordable healthcare options and millions of seniors are enjoying better, healthier, and more prosperous retirements.
82	Donald Trump	I should be retiring with you.
83	Donald Trump	I should be in this audience, clapping.
84	Donald Trump	But I didn't trust anybody to be standing here, because I know what you have.
85	Donald Trump	[Audience chants "Four More Years"]
86	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.
87	Donald Trump	It's true.
88	Donald Trump	I didn't trust anybody.
89	Donald Trump	It's very important.
90	Donald Trump	And nobody has done more in two and a half years -- their first two and a half years -- than what we've done.
91	Donald Trump	Whether it's Right to Try, whether it's tax cuts -- no matter what it is, nobody has done we've done.
92	Donald Trump	Not even close.
93	Donald Trump	We're delighted to be joined today by a man who is really, really good at -- he ran one of the largest drug companies, and really successfully, and I took him out.
94	Donald Trump	Look, that's where, you know, like -- that's where the money is.
95	Donald Trump	Well, that's where the knowledge is.
96	Donald Trump	He ran one of the biggest, most successful companies.
97	Donald Trump	I said, "Alex Azar, come on out.
98	Donald Trump	I want to get you to be the top person in charge of this."
99	Donald Trump	I said, "So, let me ask you, how much bigger is this than the company you're in?"
100	Donald Trump	It's like hundreds of times bigger.
101	Donald Trump	It's a monster.
102	Donald Trump	It's a monster.
103	Donald Trump	And what a job.
104	Donald Trump	Alex Azar, you know who he is.
105	Donald Trump	Where is Alex?
106	Donald Trump	Wherever you are.
107	Donald Trump	Alex, thank you.
108	Donald Trump	And he works with Administrator Seema Verma, who has been so incredible.
109	Donald Trump	Seema, you have to stand up.
110	Donald Trump	What a job.
111	Donald Trump	They know the most intricate little quarter sentences.
112	Donald Trump	You wouldn't believe it.
113	Donald Trump	I'd say, "What about this?"
114	Donald Trump	And they'd tell me, "Unfortunately, it's always like a little roadblock, but we figure our way around."
115	Donald Trump	And somebody else who is going to be lowering your drug prices with us in a very, very short distance.
116	Donald Trump	We're going to buying them from a slightly different source.
117	Donald Trump	A little bit unconventional.
118	Donald Trump	A lot of people say I'm unconventional; sometimes you have to be unconventional.
119	Donald Trump	And, Alex, when are we are going to let Governor Ron DeSantis and your incredible First Lady Casey DeSantis -- when are they going to be -- when are they going to be able to do what we want to do?
120	Donald Trump	Alex, when are they going to be able to do what we have to do?
121	Donald Trump	"Soon."
122	Donald Trump	Alex says, "Soon."
123	Donald Trump	Because they're going to have a big fat, beautiful surprise for you.
124	Donald Trump	And that has been an incredible couple and a great governor, and the job they're doing is phenomenal.
125	Donald Trump	And I was honored to be very much involved in that campaign.
126	Donald Trump	And if he was doing a lousy job, I'd probably just wouldn't have shown up today.
127	Donald Trump	[Laughter] But he's doing one of the best jobs in the whole country.
128	Donald Trump	Ron DeSantis.
129	Donald Trump	And also helping Ron and Casey: Jeanette Núñez, your Lieutenant Governor.
130	Donald Trump	Jeanette, thank you.
131	Donald Trump	Thank you.
132	Donald Trump	Thank you.
133	Donald Trump	Thanks, Jeanette.
134	Donald Trump	Great job.
135	Donald Trump	Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody.
136	Donald Trump	Ashley, I saw you down there.
137	Donald Trump	Thank you.
138	Donald Trump	Thank you.
139	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.
140	Donald Trump	And a few warriors we have with us.
141	Donald Trump	You know, Ron was one of our warriors.
142	Donald Trump	He was in Congress and he was fighting the Russian hoax.
143	Donald Trump	That was the Russian witch hunt hoax.
144	Donald Trump	And he was so impressive that when he said, "You know, I'd like to run for governor," I said, "I'd rather keep you right where you are because they'll come up with another crazy idea."
145	Donald Trump	But I'm glad I did it.
146	Donald Trump	And it worked out well.
147	Donald Trump	But we have warriors back in Washington, and you have five of them right here.
148	Donald Trump	Gus Bilirakis.
149	Donald Trump	Gus.
150	Donald Trump	Where's Gus?
151	Donald Trump	Thank you, Gus.
152	Donald Trump	Great job.
153	Donald Trump	The legendary Neal Dunn.
154	Donald Trump	Neal, thank you.
155	Donald Trump	These guys are warriors.
156	Donald Trump	Ross Spano.
157	Donald Trump	Thanks, Ross.
158	Donald Trump	Michael Waltz.
159	Donald Trump	Michael.
160	Donald Trump	Great job he does on television.
161	Donald Trump	All of them, they do a great job.
162	Donald Trump	They're defending us.
163	Donald Trump	They're not defending me; they're defending us, because that was the greatest election victory maybe in history.
164	Donald Trump	And they're defending us.
165	Donald Trump	And a man with one of the best names in the history of politics: Daniel Webster.
166	Donald Trump	What a name.
167	Donald Trump	If I had that name, I would've been President 10 years ago.
168	Donald Trump	[Laughter] Thank you.
169	Donald Trump	Thanks, Daniel.
170	Donald Trump	Thanks, everybody.
171	Donald Trump	Great job.
172	Donald Trump	They really are -- they're warriors.
173	Donald Trump	They go back and they fight, and they fight corruption.
174	Donald Trump	And it's corruption, what's going on right now.
175	Donald Trump	When you see this going on, it's pure corruption.
176	Donald Trump	As we gather this afternoon, Medicare is under threat like never before.
177	Donald Trump	Your know that.
178	Donald Trump	You have people that are running for office who -- if it ever happened, you will not be very happy here.
179	Donald Trump	Almost every major Democrat in Washington has backed a massive government healthcare takeover that would totally obliterate Medicare.
180	Donald Trump	These Democrat policy proposals may go by different names -- they have all of these wonderful names like -- [Audience member calls out "Wacko"]
181	Donald Trump	It'll never end.
182	Donald Trump	I'm sorry I smiled.
183	Donald Trump	They'll have me -- the fake news is back there.
184	Donald Trump	Look at all of them.
185	Donald Trump	[Audience Boos]
186	Donald Trump	They'll say, "It's terrible.
187	Donald Trump	It's terrible -- the President's smile."
188	Donald Trump	You know, they want me to admonish you.
189	Donald Trump	Who said that?
190	Donald Trump	"Lock her up."
191	Donald Trump	Stand up, please.
192	Donald Trump	I'm admonishing you.
193	Donald Trump	Never ever say that again.
194	Donald Trump	That's okay.
195	Donald Trump	Sit down.
196	Donald Trump	[Laughter] He's admonished, so now they can't do their fake number on us.
197	Donald Trump	Thank you.
198	Donald Trump	But they may go by different names, whether it's "single-payer" or the so-called "public option," but they're all based on the totally same, terrible idea.
199	Donald Trump	They want to raid Medicare to fund a thing called socialism.
200	Donald Trump	Any socialists in the room?
201	Donald Trump	I don't think so.
202	Donald Trump	Not too many.
203	Donald Trump	Anybody?
204	Audience	Booo --
205	Donald Trump	No?
206	Donald Trump	No?
207	Donald Trump	Not too many in The villages.
208	Donald Trump	You don't -- you're not big on socialism down here, right?
209	Donald Trump	These geniuses -- these real estate geniuses that know we're not -- not too good.
210	Donald Trump	Every one of these plans involves rationing care, restricting access, denying coverage, slashing quality, and massively raising taxes.
211	Donald Trump	They want to raise your taxes.
212	Donald Trump	They also want to have open borders, so the people can just come in and do whatever they want to do.
213	Donald Trump	[Audience Boos]
214	Donald Trump	And they have no idea who's coming in, by the way.
215	Donald Trump	They have no idea.
216	Donald Trump	But, you know, when these countries -- and now we're getting along great with the countries.
217	Donald Trump	Mexico gave us 27,000 soldiers guarding our border and the numbers are way down.
218	Donald Trump	Twenty-seven thousand.
219	Donald Trump	I want to thank Mexico -- the government and the President.
220	Donald Trump	Congressional Democrats' extreme agenda would destroy our booming economy very quickly.
221	Donald Trump	One of the most disturbing proposals from left-wing politicians involves draining your healthcare to finance the open borders that we just discussed.
222	Donald Trump	That's how they want to finance it.
223	Donald Trump	Leading Democrats have pledged to give free healthcare to illegal immigrants.
224	Donald Trump	They put foreign citizens who break our laws and endanger our country -- they put them way ahead of American citizens like you who obey our laws.
225	Donald Trump	I will never allow these politicians to steal your healthcare and give it away to illegal aliens.
226	Donald Trump	And now, in New York, I hear they passed a new regulation that, if you use the word, "illegal immigrant" -- did I hear correctly?
227	Donald Trump	They want to charge you a fine of $250,000.
228	Donald Trump	In other words, sell your home in The Villages because you happened to say, "We don't like illegal immigrants pouring into our country illegally."
229	Donald Trump	We want people to come into our country legally, through a process.
230	Donald Trump	And we're all in favor of that.
231	Donald Trump	And, by the way, the Fake News will cut that last part of the sentence off.
232	Donald Trump	[Laughter] They'll just put the first part.
233	Donald Trump	And they'll say, "Man, is he rough?
234	Donald Trump	He's too tough.
235	Donald Trump	I can't vote for him."
236	Donald Trump	A nation must put its own citizens first.
237	Donald Trump	My administration is standing up for American seniors.
238	Donald Trump	And we'll always protect the Medicare benefits you earned and paid for.
239	Donald Trump	In the last administration, Democrats slashed Medicare by $800 billion dollars to pay for Obamacare.
240	Donald Trump	Not too good -- Obamacare.
241	Donald Trump	[Audience Boos]
242	Donald Trump	Now one of their new proposals, backed by more than 130 Democrat members of Congress, would cost -- listen to this number -- $32 trillion dollars.
243	Donald Trump	And that's on the low side -- $32 trillion, with a "T".
244	Donald Trump	We're beyond the "B's", the billions.
245	Donald Trump	And reduce Americans' household income by $17,000 per year.
246	Donald Trump	Is there anybody in this room that doesn't mind losing $17,000 a year?
247	Donald Trump	No?
248	Donald Trump	In order to get lousy healthcare.
249	Donald Trump	Though they use many labels, all of the Democrat plans would devastate our healthcare system.
250	Donald Trump	The fake moderates on the left are telling the same lies they did under the last administration.
251	Donald Trump	But the last administration, frankly, was moderate compared to the maniacs that you're hearing from today.
252	Donald Trump	These are maniacs.
253	Donald Trump	Elizabeth "Pocahontas" Warren.
254	Donald Trump	You know, when I used to hit her, I thought she was gone, Ron.
255	Donald Trump	I thought she was gone.
256	Donald Trump	She came up from the ashes.
257	Donald Trump	She emerged.
258	Donald Trump	[Laughter] Now, we're probably going to have to do it again, because I don't see Sleepy Joe making it, I'll tell you.
259	Donald Trump	[Laughter] No, I thought she was gone.
260	Donald Trump	Under this administration, we believe that every American family has a right of choice -- you have a right to choose.
261	Donald Trump	Choice.
262	Donald Trump	So important.
263	Donald Trump	Like what we did with the vets.
264	Donald Trump	Choice.
265	Donald Trump	Where they can go out and get a doctor instead of waiting in line for three weeks, four weeks, two months.
266	Donald Trump	Choice.
267	Donald Trump	And you look at the doctor and you look at the plan that is best for you.
268	Donald Trump	The truth is, there is no longer a moderate wing of congressional Democrats.
269	Donald Trump	They've gone crazy.
270	Donald Trump	They've been hijacked by the radical left.
271	Donald Trump	I mean, these people on the left, these people are -- [Audience member calls out "Wacko"]
272	Donald Trump	[Laughs] Is that the same guy?
273	Donald Trump	I think so.
274	Donald Trump	[Laughter] I sort of like him.
275	Donald Trump	I can't admonish him again.
276	Donald Trump	[Laughter] I think it's the same guy.
277	Donald Trump	Got a powerful voice.
278	Donald Trump	Democrat lawmakers are not trying to build up the country; they only want to wreck and destroy all of the things that we've built up over the last three and a half years, four years, five years -- prior to us getting in here.
279	Donald Trump	You look at the stock market numbers from the time of the election, from that November 9th date, go a date later.
280	Donald Trump	Wasn't November 8 -- was that one of the great times?
281	Donald Trump	Huh?
282	Donald Trump	2016.
283	Donald Trump	But go a day later, and you look at the numbers in the stock market up way over 50 percent.
284	Donald Trump	The 401 [K)s are doing unbelievably well.
285	Donald Trump	One of these people gets in -- your 401(k]s are going to hell, the stock market is going to hell.
286	Donald Trump	Frankly, I think -- and I hate to say it -- the country is going to go to hell.
287	Donald Trump	They're consumed by rage and radicalism and insatiable lust for power.
288	Donald Trump	Well, how about Justice Kavanaugh?
289	Donald Trump	They talk about a woman -- .
290	Donald Trump	They talk about a woman, about horrible things that he never even thought about.
291	Donald Trump	Horrible, horrible things.
292	Donald Trump	And the following day, they want to impeach him.
293	Donald Trump	And then, the following day, she said, "No, I don't remember anything.
294	Donald Trump	I don't remember that."
295	Donald Trump	And they say, "We don't care.
296	Donald Trump	We want to impeach him anyway."
297	Donald Trump	Now, what they're trying to do is turn his vote liberal.
298	Donald Trump	But he's a much tougher guy than that.
299	Donald Trump	I hope.
300	Donald Trump	[Laughs] He's a much tougher guy.
301	Donald Trump	[Audience members calls out "So are you"]
302	Donald Trump	Thank you.
303	Donald Trump	Yeah, I better be.
304	Donald Trump	I'll tell you.
305	Donald Trump	If I weren't, I wouldn't be up here right now.
306	Donald Trump	With all that we have to put up with these people, we wouldn't be here.
307	Donald Trump	Democrat healthcare proposals would put everyone into a single, socialist, government-run program that would end private insurance for over 180 million Americans.
308	Donald Trump	I'm sort of smiling to myself as I -- as I go through these numbers.
309	Donald Trump	And I'm dealing with people that I know.
310	Donald Trump	I mean, I know the people in this room.
311	Donald Trump	Those are the people.
312	Donald Trump	I grew up with you.
313	Donald Trump	When we were young, I grew up with you.
314	Donald Trump	And now we're sort of still young at heart, at least.
315	Donald Trump	And that I'm even talking about socialism is like -- it's just -- it's sort of a weird feeling to be talking to you about "you don't want to be socialist."
316	Donald Trump	And you're probably saying, "Why is he wasting his time?"
317	Donald Trump	[Laughter] But there's a movement on.
318	Donald Trump	And it's not so easy to be beat them when they get up in a debate and they say, "We're going to cut your college tuition to nothing.
319	Donald Trump	We're going kno- -- knock off $1.6 trillion.
320	Donald Trump	We're going to do all these other things.
321	Donald Trump	Everything is free, except for your taxes."
322	Donald Trump	Your taxes are going to go up at a level that nobody has even seen before and that won't be nearly enough to pay for it.
323	Donald Trump	But I'll not let any of this bad stuff happen.
324	Donald Trump	It's very important that we win this race.
325	Donald Trump	You know, when we won last time, I said, "That's the most important election in our country's history."
326	Donald Trump	Because we were ready to go over the edge.
327	Donald Trump	And now our country is doing great.
328	Donald Trump	But, you know, it's like a plant -- it's like a tree.
329	Donald Trump	It has to grab -- those roots have to grab hold.
330	Donald Trump	We still need more time.
331	Donald Trump	We've done so much, but we need a little more time.
332	Donald Trump	That thing has to grow and it's got to get in there and then nobody is going to be able to take it down no matter what happens later on.
333	Donald Trump	So important.
334	Donald Trump	In America, we believe in freedom and liberty, not government domination and government control.
335	Donald Trump	Today, standing in solidarity with our nation's seniors, I declare once again that America will never be a socialist country -- it will never be.
336	Donald Trump	Thank you.
337	Donald Trump	[Audience chants "Four more years"]
338	Donald Trump	You want to drive them crazy?
339	Donald Trump	Don't do "four more years."
340	Donald Trump	Say "eight more years."
341	Donald Trump	You'll drive them crazy.
342	Donald Trump	[Laughter] One of these crazy maniacs on a show was interviewing somebody -- radical Left -- and he goes, "You know he's going to win, don't you?"
343	Donald Trump	Big show.
344	Donald Trump	And the guy goes, "No, no.
345	Donald Trump	We're going to fight him.
346	Donald Trump	We're going to…" "No, no, no.
347	Donald Trump	He's going to win.
348	Donald Trump	And you know he's never getting out.
349	Donald Trump	You know that don't you?"
350	Donald Trump	[Laughter] "He's not going to get out.
351	Donald Trump	You know he's…" And I thought, like -- you know, he's a comedian.
352	Donald Trump	I thought he was like kidding and having fun.
353	Donald Trump	He meant it.
354	Donald Trump	[Laughter] These people are sick.
355	Donald Trump	They meant it.
356	Donald Trump	Anyway -- but, no, if you want to drive them crazy, just say "eight more years" or "twelve more years" -- [Laughter] -- or "sixteen."
357	Donald Trump	Sixteen would do it good.
358	Donald Trump	They would -- [Laughter] -- you would really drive them into the loony bin.
359	Donald Trump	And that's why they do the impeachment crap, because they know they can't beat us fairly.
360	Donald Trump	That's the only reason they're doing it.
361	Donald Trump	They can't win.
362	Donald Trump	They can't win.
363	Donald Trump	If they won, it would be a sad day for our country.
364	Donald Trump	It'll be a sad, sad day for our country if they ever won.
365	Donald Trump	Among those who would be hit hardest by the socialist takeover are 24 million seniors on Medicare Advantage -- a lot of you.
366	Donald Trump	One out of two Hispanic seniors, one out of three African-American seniors is enrolled in Medicare Advantage.
367	Donald Trump	This very popular Medicare program -- been around for a long time -- allows private plans to compete to offer senior citizens the absolute best healthcare.
368	Donald Trump	They want to destroy it.
369	Donald Trump	While many Democrat plans would eliminate Medicare Advantage, my administration is fighting to make it even better and much, much stronger.
370	Donald Trump	And thanks to our efforts, there are nearly 1,200 more Medicare Advantage plans today than there were just two years ago.
371	Donald Trump	Think of that.
372	Donald Trump	Premiums have plummeted by 28 percent; they've gone down.
373	Donald Trump	And they're now at the lowest level in over 10 years.
374	Donald Trump	With us today is Corey Spangler.
375	Donald Trump	She lives just up the road in Summerfield.
376	Donald Trump	Corey, please tell us some of what we've been discussing on Medicare Advantage and your plan, and how important it is to you.
377	Donald Trump	Please, come up, Corey, wherever you may be.
378	Donald Trump	Oh, Corey.
379	Corey Spangler	I'm right here.
380	Corey Spangler	[Laughter]
381	Donald Trump	Thank you, Corey.
382	Corey Spangler	Okay.
383	Corey Spangler	My family came to America from Mexico when I was five years old because my father did not like the corruption and we had socialized medicine there.
384	Corey Spangler	He came to this country legally.
385	Corey Spangler	And when I turned 65, I had some heart issues.
386	Corey Spangler	I went to the doctor.
387	Corey Spangler	They scheduled me with a cardiologist.
388	Corey Spangler	He scheduled me for a stress test on a Wednesday.
389	Corey Spangler	Pass -- I didn't -- I failed that test.
390	Corey Spangler	So he scheduled me for a heart cath the next day.
391	Corey Spangler	I failed that.
392	Corey Spangler	They told me you need to have a bypass and I was going to have five bypasses done.
393	Corey Spangler	The following Monday, I was in surgery with my five pass -- five bypasses, and I went home the following Friday.
394	Corey Spangler	This would never happen with Medicare for All.
395	Corey Spangler	I love my Medicare Advantage plan, because I can choose the doctor, when I need it, and get the care I need in a quickly manner.
396	Corey Spangler	And it wouldn't happen with Medicare for All.
397	Donald Trump	That's beautiful.
398	Corey Spangler	Thank you, Mr. President, for saving my care -- healthcare.
399	Donald Trump	Thank you, Corey.
400	Donald Trump	I see a future politician there.
401	Donald Trump	That was -- [Laughter] -- boy, she was so like calm.
402	Donald Trump	No nerves.
403	Donald Trump	You know, sometimes I'll see people, they get a little bit nervous.
404	Donald Trump	Very good.
405	Donald Trump	What a job they've done.
406	Donald Trump	Great doctors.
407	Donald Trump	Did you choose your own doctor or you get lucky with a good doctor that was recommended?
408	Corey Spangler	They were wonderful.
409	Donald Trump	They were wonderful.
410	Donald Trump	That's fantastic.
411	Donald Trump	And you're wonderful.
412	Donald Trump	Thank you, Corey.
413	Donald Trump	Appreciate it.
414	Donald Trump	The Democrat plans for socialized medicine will not just put doctors and hospitals out of business, they'll also deny your treatment and everything that you need.
415	Donald Trump	Government-run healthcare systems always end up imposing rationing.
416	Donald Trump	You see what happens.
417	Donald Trump	You look at Venezuela; take a look at that.
418	Donald Trump	Fifteen years ago, it's one of the wealthiest countries.
419	Donald Trump	Now they don't have food.
420	Donald Trump	They don't have water.
421	Donald Trump	The hospitals are a disaster.
422	Donald Trump	No electricity.
423	Donald Trump	No anything.
424	Donald Trump	It's very sad.
425	Donald Trump	And we're helping the people as much as we can.
426	Donald Trump	But we're watching that whole situation -- beyond this, we're watching it very, very carefully.
427	Donald Trump	We're watching it very carefully.
428	Donald Trump	And Cuba -- we're watching Cuba very carefully.
429	Donald Trump	Very, very carefully.
430	Donald Trump	But as an example, under the United Kingdom's single-payer system, patients wait 117 days to receive, as an example, a knee replacement.
431	Donald Trump	One hundred and seventeen days.
432	Donald Trump	In Canada, wait times for orthopedic surgery are over 270 days.
433	Donald Trump	But currently in the United States, wait times for these surgeries are -- we've speeded it up a lot -- are typically less than two weeks.
434	Donald Trump	Is that right, Alex?
435	Donald Trump	And I have many people coming down from Canada, and I say, "What are you doing?"
436	Donald Trump	They're getting an operation of some kind.
437	Donald Trump	"Why don't you get it up there?"
438	Donald Trump	They said, "There's nothing like what you've been able to do in a short period of time."
439	Donald Trump	And we're making it even better.
440	Donald Trump	With us today is Charles McLaughlin, a 71-year-old Floridian and a Marine veteran of the Vietnam War.
441	Donald Trump	Charles, please come up and tell us your story.
442	Donald Trump	Please.
443	Charles McLaughlin	Oh, man.
444	Charles McLaughlin	Hello to The Villages!
445	Charles McLaughlin	What a great place you guys have here.
446	Charles McLaughlin	Wow.
447	Charles McLaughlin	I understand that approximately 60 percent of all of you are veterans.
448	Charles McLaughlin	I want to say thank you for your service.
449	Charles McLaughlin	And to my Vietnam brothers and sisters: Welcome home.
450	Charles McLaughlin	Welcome home.
451	Charles McLaughlin	My name is Chuck McLaughlin, and I'm a Vietnam combat Marine.
452	Charles McLaughlin	I'm also a cancer survivor -- Stage 4 style.
453	Charles McLaughlin	I know a lot about Medicare and the supplement.
454	Charles McLaughlin	I used it for breathing tubes, feeding tubes, stitches, staples, MRIs, PET scans, CAT scans, blood tests, hydration shots, chemo treatments, radiation treatments, six months of hypobaric chamber -- to name a few.
455	Charles McLaughlin	Anyone that's cured, like me, loves their doctors.
456	Charles McLaughlin	Loves their doctors.
457	Charles McLaughlin	I also want to say: My family, financially, would've been destroyed without Medicare.
458	Charles McLaughlin	Destroyed.
459	Charles McLaughlin	The facts are now [Inaudible] the politicians on the left are pushing Medicare for All.
460	Charles McLaughlin	I say the result will be no Medicare at all.
461	Charles McLaughlin	It will collapse under the load -- the load of the system.
462	Charles McLaughlin	It will overload of it.
463	Charles McLaughlin	The lines would be incredible.
464	Charles McLaughlin	Who knows?
465	Charles McLaughlin	I probably wouldn't be here.
466	Charles McLaughlin	As far as free stuff, it may be free stuff, but it's going to come out of somebody else's pocket.
467	Charles McLaughlin	There's no such thing as "free."
468	Charles McLaughlin	Period.
469	Charles McLaughlin	Is the Medicare system perfect?
470	Charles McLaughlin	No.
471	Charles McLaughlin	But it worked for me.
472	Charles McLaughlin	Remember, I paid my share.
473	Charles McLaughlin	Just a few thoughts: President Trump's plan of Medicare Advantage will give me more flexibility for options to this system.
474	Charles McLaughlin	I can pick and choose my needs.
475	Charles McLaughlin	Secondly, a program that helps protect us seniors for a fair shake as our bodies fail us.
476	Charles McLaughlin	And number three, we must get rid of the waste and fraud that seems to be in the newspapers weekly.
477	Charles McLaughlin	Finally, thank you, President Trump, for all you do.
478	Charles McLaughlin	I want to personally thank him for what he does for our veterans.
479	Charles McLaughlin	Finally, and may God bless you and your family for loving America and giving us a renewed hope for our children and our grandchildren.
480	Charles McLaughlin	Thank you.
481	Donald Trump	What a great job.
482	Donald Trump	Well, thank you very much, Charles.
483	Donald Trump	And it's incredible.
484	Donald Trump	You've gone through a lot.
485	Charles McLaughlin	Yep.
486	Donald Trump	You don't look it.
487	Donald Trump	[Laughter] He's looking handsome to me, I'll tell you.
488	Donald Trump	[Laughter] Thanks, Charles.
489	Donald Trump	That's incredible.
490	Donald Trump	Like you, all of us today understand the truth.
491	Donald Trump	Socialism is not about improving the health of American people; it's about wielding power over the American people, taking things away from the American people.
492	Donald Trump	In a few moments, I will sign an executive order to strengthen Medicare for seniors, and very substantially.
493	Donald Trump	I'll provide Medicare Advantage plans with new tools and options, and it will help Medicare beneficiaries gain faster access to the very latest and greatest medical devices and therapies.
494	Donald Trump	My order also pursues reductions in the unnecessary regulations that you don't need, you don't want to see -- that never come into effect and that cost a lot of money -- enabling doctors and nurses to spend less time on paperwork and more time with their patients that they love.
495	Donald Trump	To further protect seniors, we are taking action to stop fraud and to stop abuse.
496	Donald Trump	It's tremendous amounts of money saved with that.
497	Donald Trump	And we'll be able to put that money right back into what we want to have it to take care of you.
498	Donald Trump	I'm directing Secretary Azar to crack down on criminals, cheaters, and dishonest providers who rob Medicare of the funds you have and the money that you've paid into the system all of your lives.
499	Donald Trump	Charles said it.
500	Donald Trump	Charles said, "You know, I paid for it."
501	Donald Trump	He said he paid for it.
502	Donald Trump	And now they want to say, "Let's give it to everybody else."
503	Donald Trump	And it's going to be gone in a very short number of years.
504	Donald Trump	But you did pay for it.
505	Donald Trump	You both paid for it.
506	Donald Trump	Today's action is the only really great action that we can take.
507	Donald Trump	It's the only choice we have because this is going to be something that's better than any place anywhere in the world.
508	Donald Trump	It's the latest of many important steps that we're taking to dramatically improve healthcare for the American people.
509	Donald Trump	Our vision for the future of health in America has four crucial parts.
510	Donald Trump	And we will protect vulnerable patients, number one.
511	Donald Trump	We will protect those patients that are so terribly vulnerable.
512	Donald Trump	We will deliver the affordability that you need.
513	Donald Trump	Prices coming down.
514	Donald Trump	As I said, prescription drug prices -- first time in over 50 years, Alex, that drug prices have come down for the year.
515	Donald Trump	Your average prescription drug price -- first time in 50 years -- over 50 years.
516	Donald Trump	And we're going to get them a lot lower.
517	Donald Trump	And I think Ron is going to have some big surprises.
518	Donald Trump	We'll be announcing that pretty soon.
519	Donald Trump	Some -- for really, really big reductions.
520	Donald Trump	People are already -- they're not even going to know what happened.
521	Donald Trump	So that's what we want.
522	Donald Trump	And we're going to give you options and control that you want.
523	Donald Trump	And we will provide the quality you deserve.
524	Donald Trump	First, we're protecting vulnerable Americans.
525	Donald Trump	We have made a clear promise to America's patients: We will always protect patients with preexisting conditions.
526	Donald Trump	The Republicans will always protect preexisting conditions.
527	Donald Trump	To stop families from being blindsided by outrageous medical bills -- and this is something that is one of the most exciting things to me -- I have challenged Congress to send a bill to my desk that stops the horrendous practice of surprise medical billing.
528	Donald Trump	So many of you, you go in and you have something, and then you get a bill and you say, "How is it possible?"
529	Donald Trump	And we're going to end that practice.
530	Donald Trump	That practice is not a fair practice.
531	Donald Trump	And we're also confronting the opioid and drug addiction epidemic that is plaguing too many American communities.
532	Donald Trump	And thanks to our efforts -- and we've worked so hard on it; the First Lady worked so hard.
533	Donald Trump	Kellyanne Conway -- where's Kellyanne?
534	Donald Trump	Where's Kellyanne?
535	Donald Trump	Where is she?
536	Donald Trump	Kellyanne, thank you.
537	Donald Trump	Thank you, Kellyanne.
538	Donald Trump	Last year, drug overdose deaths declined for the first time in nearly three decades.
539	Donald Trump	Early data shows that drug overdose deaths dropped 10 percent last year in the state of Florida.
540	Donald Trump	Now, think of that.
541	Donald Trump	That's -- you know, we'd like to better.
542	Donald Trump	It's a very, very tough situation.
543	Donald Trump	And one of the things we're doing with the "pain pills" -- we can call them -- we're trying to find, and we're really working hard and we're funding a lot of research to find pain pills that aren't addictive.
544	Donald Trump	You go into to a hospital with a broken arm, and you come out and you're drug addict.
545	Donald Trump	And we're trying to find, and we're getting closer -- I think we're getting very close, actually -- to finding painkillers that aren't addictive.
546	Donald Trump	And we'll have that in the not-too-distant future.
547	Donald Trump	And to care for our great veterans, we passed VA Accountability.
548	Donald Trump	You know what that is, right?
549	Donald Trump	This is where the great heroes and tough people -- but -- and, by the way, in their super prime, nobody touched them.
550	Donald Trump	But they're more vulnerable, and people would take advantage of our veterans.
551	Donald Trump	You had sadists.
552	Donald Trump	You had people that would rob them and rob the system.
553	Donald Trump	You had some horrible people.
554	Donald Trump	We couldn't fire anybody.
555	Donald Trump	They had, in Arizona, people that got stealing -- they got caught stealing $400,000.
556	Donald Trump	They couldn't fire them.
557	Donald Trump	So now we have VA Accountability.
558	Donald Trump	You think that was easy?
559	Donald Trump	They've been trying to get it for 50 years.
560	Donald Trump	And I got it.
561	Donald Trump	I'm good at getting things.
562	Donald Trump	So now, when they don't take proper care of our vets, we say, "Jim, get the hell out of here.
563	Donald Trump	You're fired.
564	Donald Trump	Get out of here."
565	Donald Trump	We can fire them.
566	Donald Trump	Get them out.
567	Donald Trump	We get them out.
568	Donald Trump	We don't have to ask questions.
569	Donald Trump	We get them out.
570	Donald Trump	If they're bad, they treat our veterans badly, we fire them.
571	Donald Trump	That's why you don't hear about -- you know, before me, every night you'd see these stories, these horror stories about the VA.
572	Donald Trump	I haven't seen one in a long time.
573	Donald Trump	Now, I don't want to wish it because the fake news will search the system -- [Laughter] -- to find somebody that's not happy.
574	Donald Trump	"We found somebody.
575	Donald Trump	We found a vet in Florida who isn't quite happy with everything.
576	Donald Trump	Let's do a major story."
577	Donald Trump	But do you remember all of the bad stories that used to be about the VA?
578	Donald Trump	Now you don't see that because they have accountability.
579	Donald Trump	We can fire bad people.
580	Donald Trump	We fired a tremendous number of really bad people that should've been fired years ago.
581	Donald Trump	I don't like firing people, but I like firing people that don't treat our vets great, that aren't doing their job.
582	Donald Trump	And they were protected, frankly, by the unions, and they were protected by civil service -- very powerful.
583	Donald Trump	Do you think it was easy beating unions and civil service?
584	Donald Trump	Not too easy.
585	Donald Trump	But I explained to them too.
586	Donald Trump	I said, "This is good for all of us.
587	Donald Trump	It's good for America."
588	Donald Trump	And the other, as I said, is VA Choice, where our veterans no longer have to wait for endless, endless hours, days -- even months.
589	Donald Trump	We've had cases where a person is on line -- not bad; could be fixed up very easily with whatever treatment it may be -- and they end up being terminal by the time they see a doctor.
590	Donald Trump	That's not happening anymore.
591	Donald Trump	Because now you go out, you find a great local doctor, we pay the bill.
592	Donald Trump	And, you know, it's interesting, it's totally less important but we also save a lot of money on that.
593	Donald Trump	Hard to believe, we save a lot of money.
594	Donald Trump	It's much less expensive for us to do that than the other way, and it's saving tremendous numbers of lives.
595	Donald Trump	And we have great doctors, frankly, that need the business.
596	Donald Trump	Not so bad.
597	Donald Trump	To protect healthcare for our seniors and all Americans, my administration is taking strong actions to ensure that newcomers to our society do not drain our healthcare system, or burden the services that you depend on.
598	Donald Trump	You see these people in California, the governor of California -- "Come on in, everybody."
599	Donald Trump	Then you wonder why people are flooding our borders.
600	Donald Trump	Come on in.
601	Donald Trump	You have free education, free healthcare.
602	Donald Trump	Everybody gets a Rolls-Royce.
603	Donald Trump	[Laughter] "Come on in.
604	Donald Trump	Come on in."
605	Donald Trump	You know, to show you how corrupt CNN is, when I used that expression, they said, "The President wasn't telling the truth.
606	Donald Trump	He said they get a Rolls-Royce and they don't."
607	Donald Trump	[Laughter] Ahh, they don't get it, do they?
608	Donald Trump	They never got it.
609	Donald Trump	Some idiot at CNN said, "You can't win without CNN.
610	Donald Trump	I guess we showed them."
611	Donald Trump	[Laughter] I guess we showed them.
612	Donald Trump	And their ratings are so low now that they are no longer the big difference at all.
613	Donald Trump	They have really bad ratings.
614	Donald Trump	But you know what is bad for our country?
615	Donald Trump	When CNN -- so often I go to a foreign country.
616	Donald Trump	I go to a country.
617	Donald Trump	I meet leaders.
618	Donald Trump	And he said, "Why do they hate your country so much?"
619	Donald Trump	I said, "Who?"
620	Donald Trump	You know, CNN outside of the United States is much more important than it is in the United States.
621	Donald Trump	And a lot of what you see here is broadcast throughout the world.
622	Donald Trump	And we used to have Radio Free -- I think Radio Free Europe and Voice of America.
623	Donald Trump	And we did that to build up our country.
624	Donald Trump	And that's not working out too well.
625	Donald Trump	But CNN is a voice that really seems to be the voice out there.
626	Donald Trump	And it's a terrible thing for our country.
627	Donald Trump	And we ought to start our network and put some real news out there because they are so bad.
628	Donald Trump	They are so bad for our country.
629	Donald Trump	They are so bad for our country.
630	Donald Trump	I go out there and they say, "Boy, the media hates your country."
631	Donald Trump	And it's just a shame.
632	Donald Trump	It's just a shame.
633	Donald Trump	And we really are -- we are looking at that.
634	Donald Trump	We should do something about it, too.
635	Donald Trump	Put some really talented people and get a real voice out there, not a voice that's fake.
636	Donald Trump	When Americans are struck by natural disaster, like they were in Florida where I was with you, Hurricane Michael -- did I do a good job, Governor?
637	Donald Trump	Did I do a good job?
638	Donald Trump	Man.
639	Donald Trump	Your governor came to my office once a week.
640	Donald Trump	He always needed more money -- [Laughter] -- and I always gave it, right?
641	Donald Trump	He didn't stop.
642	Donald Trump	I hated it.
643	Donald Trump	I said, "Keep DeSantis.
644	Donald Trump	I don't want to see him anymore."
645	Donald Trump	[Laughter] But we always gave it, and you got it.
646	Donald Trump	And your people worked so hard.
647	Donald Trump	And FEMA and the military, they all worked with you.
648	Donald Trump	The Coast Guard is incredible, what the Coast Guard has done.
649	Donald Trump	I think the Coast Guard has really done a great job.
650	Donald Trump	The second part of our healthcare agenda is to promote the affordability of America's needs.
651	Donald Trump	Thanks to our focus on lower drug prices, the FDA approved more low-cost generic drugs in my first two years than ever before in the history of our country.
652	Donald Trump	Think of that.
653	Donald Trump	Think of that.
654	Donald Trump	And every time I'd see the folks over at FDA, I'd say, "Come on, fellas.
655	Donald Trump	Let's go.
656	Donald Trump	Faster.
657	Donald Trump	Faster."
658	Donald Trump	You know, don't forget, when somebody was dying and we had a drug that looked like it was really good but it wasn't going be approved for like four more years -- it used to be 12 years and we brought it way down.
659	Donald Trump	I mean, it's too long.
660	Donald Trump	But we brought it way, way down.
661	Donald Trump	But a person is dying and they said, "No, sir, we can't give that because it may harm the person."
662	Donald Trump	I said, "Wait a minute, you don't understand."
663	Donald Trump	[Laughter] "A person is terminally ill, they've got four weeks to live, and you don't want to give them a drug because you think it's going to harm them?
664	Donald Trump	I guarantee you I can get them to sign a document."
665	Donald Trump	[Laughter] Now we got that approved -- Right to Try.
666	Donald Trump	And, by the way, miracles are happening.
667	Donald Trump	Right?
668	Donald Trump	Miracles.
669	Donald Trump	Miracles are happening.
670	Donald Trump	Hopefully, it never happens to anybody in this room.
671	Donald Trump	But, frankly, people would go to Asia, they'd go to Europe, they'd go all over the world seeking a cure, if they had money.
672	Donald Trump	If they didn't have money, they'd go home and they'd die.
673	Donald Trump	But now they don't have to do that.
674	Donald Trump	And it wasn't easy because the drug companies didn't want it because they didn't want to have terminally ill because it looks bad on the percentage record, right?
675	Donald Trump	The insurance companies didn't want it because there are a lot of reasons.
676	Donald Trump	You know what the reasons are.
677	Donald Trump	Our government didn't want it because they didn't want to be sued by a patient that died that would've died anyway.
678	Donald Trump	So I said, "Here's what we do, folks: We sign an agreement.
679	Donald Trump	And the agreement holds everybody non-liable."
680	Donald Trump	We took the drug companies and we created a separate list, so they're not on that list -- because it is, right?
681	Donald Trump	It's a problem.
682	Donald Trump	And we took a separate list.
683	Donald Trump	So now we have a totally separate list -- confidential list -- but they don't get hurt by somebody that was so sick that this person may not make it.
684	Donald Trump	And I got everybody to sign it and we were done.
685	Donald Trump	It was pretty amazing.
686	Donald Trump	And then we got it approved in Congress because of these five great congressmen back there, including Ron, who at the time was in Congress.
687	Donald Trump	Right?
688	Donald Trump	With Greg and everybody, we got it done and we got the Senate to approve it.
689	Donald Trump	And I signed it.
690	Donald Trump	And I was really happy.
691	Donald Trump	Right to Try.
692	Donald Trump	Hopefully you never need it.
693	Donald Trump	We also ended the terrible gag clauses that prevented pharmacists from telling you about cheaper options at the pharmacy counter.
694	Donald Trump	Do you believe it?
695	Donald Trump	I thought this was -- I thought they were kidding me the first time.
696	Donald Trump	Don't forget, I've only been doing this for three years, okay?
697	Donald Trump	So, you know.
698	Donald Trump	[Laughter] These guys have been doing it a long time.
699	Donald Trump	But they're not allowed to talk to you about pricing.
700	Donald Trump	I said, "Wait.
701	Donald Trump	You've got to be kidding."
702	Donald Trump	And they weren't.
703	Donald Trump	But I got rid of that.
704	Donald Trump	Now they can talk about pricing.
705	Donald Trump	You can go out and price.
706	Donald Trump	You can go to different places.
707	Donald Trump	They have to be open and transparent.
708	Donald Trump	That was a big deal.
709	Donald Trump	That was a big deal.
710	Donald Trump	And all of these things, you know, they sound so simple; they're tough to get.
711	Donald Trump	They've been that way for many years for a reason.
712	Donald Trump	You have very powerful lobbyists.
713	Donald Trump	You have drug companies, frankly, that don't want that.
714	Donald Trump	Why would they want that, where you can negotiate price?
715	Donald Trump	Why would they want a thing like that?
716	Donald Trump	My administration is also working to require drug companies to disclose prices in their television advertisements.
717	Donald Trump	And we're almost getting to a point where we're going to be able to get that.
718	Donald Trump	So you're going to know what you're paying up front.
719	Donald Trump	They can't triple-hit you.
720	Donald Trump	Essentially, we're holding Big Pharma accountable.
721	Donald Trump	And that's okay; they do just fine.
722	Donald Trump	Earlier this year, we announced another groundbreaking action seniors have wanted for decades.
723	Donald Trump	We will soon allow the safe and legal importation of prescription drugs from other countries, including the country of Canada, where, believe it or not, they pay much less money for the exact same drug.
724	Donald Trump	Stand up, Ron.
725	Donald Trump	Boy, he wants this so badly.
726	Donald Trump	No, I mean, you go to some countries and the price is like 50, 60 percent lower -- even more than that, I guess, Ron, in some cases.
727	Donald Trump	And it's 50, 60 percent lower -- the exact same pill, from the exact same factory, from the exact same company.
728	Donald Trump	And I say, "Why is it that in Europe -- certain places, in particular -- it's 25 percent of what we pay back here?"
729	Donald Trump	I said, "It must be a different manufacturer."
730	Donald Trump	"No, sir, it's the same one."
731	Donald Trump	"Must be made in a different factory."
732	Donald Trump	"No, sir, it's the same one."
733	Donald Trump	Everything is identical; they pay 25 percent.
734	Donald Trump	We pick up all of the research and development.
735	Donald Trump	We pick up everything like a bunch of, excuse me, schmucks.
736	Donald Trump	[Laughter] Schmucks.
737	Donald Trump	Right?
738	Donald Trump	Not anymore, folks, because in a little while -- in a little while, your governor is going to be able to go out and negotiate until his heart is content.
739	Donald Trump	And he's going to go to Canada.
740	Donald Trump	I know he's gone there already and he's looking at their pricing, and he's going to some of the European countries and others, and he's going to get his drug price down to a level that you can't believe.
741	Donald Trump	It's going to be a great thing.
742	Donald Trump	And we'll see what happens.
743	Donald Trump	It's going to be very interesting.
744	Donald Trump	And I have a feeling when that happens, the drug companies are just going to say, "We can't have this."
745	Donald Trump	And they're going to drop their price, I think.
746	Donald Trump	Now, they're very smart.
747	Donald Trump	They may go the other way, and if they do, don't blame me, okay?
748	Donald Trump	[Laughter] But I'm pretty sure you're going to do fantastically, Ron.
749	Donald Trump	You feel good about it?
750	Donald Trump	Huh?
751	Donald Trump	You better do good; otherwise, you're making us both look bad.
752	Donald Trump	[Laughter] You hear that, Casey?
753	Donald Trump	American patients must no longer be forced to subsidize lower drug prices in other countries through higher prices in America.
754	Donald Trump	That's what we were doing.
755	Donald Trump	We were paying a much higher price.
756	Donald Trump	My administration will never stop fighting for lower costs for American patients and American seniors.
757	Donald Trump	The third part of our healthcare vision is to provide the choice and control Americans want.
758	Donald Trump	We eliminated Obamacare's horrible, horrible, very expensive and very unfair, unpopular individual mandate.
759	Donald Trump	A total disaster.
760	Donald Trump	That was a big penalty.
761	Donald Trump	That was a big thing.
762	Donald Trump	Where you paid a lot of money for the privilege of not having to pay a lot of money for the privilege of having no healthcare.
763	Donald Trump	You paid not to have healthcare.
764	Donald Trump	It was a penalty.
765	Donald Trump	And how it ever held up in Supreme Court, I don't know, but it did.
766	Donald Trump	But we just got rid of it.
767	Donald Trump	We just did it the old-fashioned way: We got rid of it.
768	Donald Trump	We vastly expanded affordable insurance options, including association health plans, short-term plans, and health reimbursement arrangements -- which are incredible.
769	Donald Trump	And many of these options are up to 60 percent less expensive than "O-bomb-a-care."
770	Donald Trump	Nobody got that.
771	Donald Trump	[Laughs] Nobody got that.
772	Donald Trump	That's okay.
773	Donald Trump	"O-bomb-a-care."
774	Donald Trump	I didn't say "Obamacare."
775	Donald Trump	I said "O-bomb-a-care."
776	Donald Trump	[Laughter] President "O-bomb-a-care."
777	Donald Trump	He can have it.
778	Donald Trump	But we've done a great job in running it.
779	Donald Trump	We almost had it done.
780	Donald Trump	We unfortunately had one vote -- middle of the night -- just when thumbs down.
781	Donald Trump	That wasn't good.
782	Donald Trump	After years and years of campaigning -- "repeal and replace," right?
783	Donald Trump	But we've done a great job because we get rid of the individual mandate.
784	Donald Trump	And we're running it better.
785	Donald Trump	It's still no good, because it's too expensive.
786	Donald Trump	The premium is way too high and all of the elements of it.
787	Donald Trump	It's just not good.
788	Donald Trump	But we're coming up with an incredible plan that if the Republicans take back the House, keep the Senate, keep the presidency, we're going to have a fantastic plan.
789	Donald Trump	Right?
790	Donald Trump	Following my administration's recommendation, Florida has taken an important step to lower cost and increase choice by repealing a misguided Certificate of Need law, used by hospitals to block competition.
791	Donald Trump	We encourage other states to follow Florida's example.
792	Donald Trump	They've done a great job right here.
793	Donald Trump	And I also signed, just recently, a revolutionary executive order requiring price and quality transparency.
794	Donald Trump	And the man who's really the leader in the world of this -- it's transparency.
795	Donald Trump	You can pick your doctor; you can look at their records; you can see how well they did.
796	Donald Trump	You can go and negotiate.
797	Donald Trump	A man -- what really sold me on it -- the man who's the best in the world at it, who we used, and we gave you the max plan.
798	Donald Trump	Did we give that?
799	Donald Trump	The max plan, right?
800	Donald Trump	That's the maximum plan.
801	Donald Trump	We gave it to you.
802	Donald Trump	And he said something that I loved.
803	Donald Trump	He said, "Sir, this is more important and will go down as more important than any healthcare that you'll ever come up with."
804	Donald Trump	And I said, "I like the sound of that."
805	Donald Trump	Now, who knows if it's true, but I guess, from what I'm hearing, they've done it in certain limited areas and it's phenomenal.
806	Donald Trump	And it's really transparency.
807	Donald Trump	And you'll be able to negotiate all over the place.
808	Donald Trump	And you'll be able to pick everything you want, from the hospital to the doctor.
809	Donald Trump	And it's going to save you a tremendous amount of money.
810	Donald Trump	And there are those that say it's more important than even healthcare at a high -- at a high level.
811	Donald Trump	And fourth, my administration is fighting to ensure the high-quality care that Americans deserve.
812	Donald Trump	Americans have to get the highest quality.
813	Donald Trump	So we have the highest quality that Americans deserve.
814	Donald Trump	On behalf of 5 million Americans living with Alzheimer's disease, I signed into law a $1 billion increase in funding for critical Alzheimer's research.
815	Donald Trump	And we've made a lot of progress.
816	Donald Trump	And just one other thing I will tell you -- because it even surprised me -- but we've funded it now, and, within 10 years, our country will be AIDS-free.
817	Donald Trump	Can you believe that?
818	Donald Trump	AIDS-free.
819	Donald Trump	Tremendous progress has been made.
820	Donald Trump	And when we were talking about that, I said, "I don't understand.
821	Donald Trump	How does this…" It's like somewhat of a secret, but it's incredible -- the tremendous progress that we've made over the last few years on AIDS and AIDS research.
822	Donald Trump	And we should be essentially AIDS-free.
823	Donald Trump	Do you agree with that, Mr. Secretary?
824	Donald Trump	In my State of the Union, I announced a plan to invest -- [Laughs] -- she liked it -- $500 million dollars in new treatments, and cures, and all of the things that we have to go through with our incredible children, in some cases, for childhood cancers.
825	Donald Trump	It's a tremendous problem.
826	Donald Trump	And to bring new hope to the nearly 100,000 Americans currently awaiting a kidney operation, I signed an executive order that will significantly increase the supply of kidneys available for transplant.
827	Donald Trump	It's such a big deal.
828	Donald Trump	It's so big.
829	Donald Trump	You have no idea.
830	Donald Trump	And we worked hard on that.
831	Donald Trump	And, you know, what a lot of people don't know -- a lot of it is just the work.
832	Donald Trump	The people die fairly quickly because it's not -- they could go on forever.
833	Donald Trump	But it's -- it's unbelievable amounts of work, going in all the time for step-by-step -- what you have to do.
834	Donald Trump	And so, with kidney transplants, we're making tremendous progress.
835	Donald Trump	And we funded a lot of money toward it.
836	Donald Trump	And I think it's going to be a tremendous thing for people that are just literally suffering with something they can really do very well with.
837	Donald Trump	We're delivering better, fairer, and more affordable healthcare for all Americans, especially our cherished senior citizens.
838	Donald Trump	And we will stop at nothing to deliver better healthcare for you and for your family.
839	Donald Trump	I will never let you down.
840	Donald Trump	You have been incredible to me and I will never ever forget you.
841	Donald Trump	I will never let you down.
842	Donald Trump	I promise that.
843	Donald Trump	Thank you.
844	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.
845	Donald Trump	We're lowering the cost of prescription drugs, taking on the pharmaceutical companies.
846	Donald Trump	And you think that's easy?
847	Donald Trump	It's not easy.
848	Donald Trump	It's not easy.
849	Donald Trump	They come at you from all different sides.
850	Donald Trump	I wouldn't be surprised if the hoax didn't come a little bit from some of the people that we're taking on.
851	Donald Trump	They're very powerful.
852	Donald Trump	They spend a lot of money -- spend, I think, more money than any other group in the world actually, in terms of lobbying and lobbying abilities.
853	Donald Trump	And I wouldn't be surprised if some of the nonsense that we all have to go through, but that I go through -- wouldn't be surprised if it was from these -- some of these industries like pharmaceuticals that we take on because I want -- I don't care.
854	Donald Trump	I did great.
855	Donald Trump	I've had a great life.
856	Donald Trump	I want to get drug prices down.
857	Donald Trump	I don't care about the companies I want to get drug prices down.
858	Donald Trump	I want to continue to give them the incentive to come out with new and better answers, but got to get drug prices down.
859	Donald Trump	And they've made a fortune over the last 40 years.
860	Donald Trump	They've made so much money.
861	Donald Trump	And they've got the system wired.
862	Donald Trump	Because everything you do, their stock goes up.
863	Donald Trump	I said, "What the hell is going on?
864	Donald Trump	Their stock just went up."
865	Donald Trump	They said, "Sir, it's going to be wonderful."
866	Donald Trump	I said, "It's not going to be wonderful."
867	Donald Trump	Let their stock go down a little bit.
868	Donald Trump	But their stock goes up.
869	Donald Trump	And what we've done is incredible.
870	Donald Trump	And, by the way, you have some incredible companies.
871	Donald Trump	The answers that they -- we -- we want to keep them strong and powerful and wealthy, and we want them to con- -- really continue to do that research.
872	Donald Trump	But we got to get those prices down.
873	Donald Trump	They're far too high, especially when you compare them to other countries.
874	Donald Trump	And we want to ensure access to the doctors of your choice.
875	Donald Trump	And every day, we are going to -- as I said, we are going to defend Medicare like Medicare has never been defended again.
876	Donald Trump	And it's never needed the defense.
877	Donald Trump	It's always been incredible.
878	Donald Trump	It's something that worked and they want to destroy it.
879	Donald Trump	In my administration, we know that Medicare is personal.
880	Donald Trump	Great healthcare is about more time with the ones you love, more days with your grandkids, and more freedom to enjoy the most rewarding years of your life -- or what should be, by far, the most rewarding years of your life.
881	Donald Trump	You've worked hard.
882	Donald Trump	You've worked so hard.
883	Donald Trump	And you paid for it.
884	Donald Trump	And you've got to enjoy it.
885	Donald Trump	It's about getting better when you're sick, it's improving your well-being, and it's getting the treatment you need, right when you need it.
886	Donald Trump	That's why, in everything we do, we are defending the principles that made America the envy of the world and the American way of life the greatest in our history.
887	Donald Trump	And our country has never been greater than it's been right now.
888	Donald Trump	Our military is the strongest it's ever built -- we rebuilt our entire military.
889	Donald Trump	And even medical research is at a new level.
890	Donald Trump	It's at a level that we've never had it before.
891	Donald Trump	We stand for freedom.
892	Donald Trump	We stand for choice.
893	Donald Trump	We stand for justice, and fairness, and accountability.
894	Donald Trump	We stand for loyalty to our citizens, love for our country, allegiance to our flag, and long and healthy lives for our great seniors.
895	Donald Trump	And with your help, we are going to continue building the best, most advanced, most cutting-edge healthcare system anywhere in the world.
896	Donald Trump	We are going to expand our growing economy to make retirement easier, and better, and far more secure.
897	Donald Trump	We're going to defend American lives, American values, American families, and America's glorious destiny.
898	Donald Trump	There is no country like our country.
899	Donald Trump	We see and read things, but there is no country like our country.
900	Donald Trump	Right?
901	Donald Trump	With every ounce of strength and every bit of soul, we are going to protect Medicare for you -- for everyone at The Villages, and for every senior across this magnificent land.
902	Donald Trump	You are going to be protected in many ways -- but you are going to be protected.
903	Donald Trump	Thank you very being here.
904	Donald Trump	Thank you for this incredible enthusiasm.
905	Donald Trump	God bless you.
906	Donald Trump	God bless our senior citizens.
907	Donald Trump	And God bless America.
908	Donald Trump	Thank you very much, everybody.
909	Donald Trump	Thank you.
910	Donald Trump	Okay.
911	Donald Trump	Should I do it?
912	Donald Trump	I'll do it.
913	Donald Trump	All right.
914	Donald Trump	[The executive order is signed]
915	Donald Trump	Thank you everybody.
916	Donald Trump	Here -- grab these, fellas.
917	Donald Trump	Pass them around.
918	Donald Trump	The congressmen don't want [Inaudible], and I know that.
919	Donald Trump	Here you go.
920	Donald Trump	I love that.
921	Donald Trump	I love that.
922	Donald Trump	I love those guys.
923	Donald Trump	"Bikers for 45."
924	Donald Trump	These guys.
925	Donald Trump	[Laughter] They've been there from the beginning, right?
926	Donald Trump	Here.
927	Donald Trump	Pass them around.
928	Donald Trump	Pass these around, fellas.
929	Donald Trump	Pass them around.
930	Donald Trump	Come here.
931	Donald Trump	Attorney General, get over here.
932	Donald Trump	Come on.
933	Donald Trump	Get over here.
934	Donald Trump	Lieutenant Governor, come on.
935	Donald Trump	Please, both of you.
936	Donald Trump	Come on up here.
937	Donald Trump	They're doing a good job, right?
938	Donald Trump	Should we give them a pen?
939	Donald Trump	I think so.
940	Donald Trump	Come on up here.
941	Donald Trump	That's great.
942	Donald Trump	I want to thank you all.
943	Donald Trump	Really a special time.
944	Donald Trump	And this is -- this is very meaningful for me and for you and for everybody.
945	Donald Trump	Thank you all very much.
946	Donald Trump	Thank you.
