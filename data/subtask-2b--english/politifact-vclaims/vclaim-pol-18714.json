But at the town hall, Biden highlighted other parts of the law that have been more popular.\nThe idea behind community policing was to develop new policing strategies focused on engaging officers members of the community on their beat, rather than seeming like an occupying force.\nIn an exchange with host George Stephanopoulos in the Oct. 15 town hall, Biden lamented that \"they eliminated the funding for community policing.\"\nBiden was vague about who eliminated the funding, and when. Either way, he\u2019s wrong about the elimination of funding.\nBiden\u2019s campaign told PolitiFact that he was referring to Trump\u2019s fiscal 2019 budget proposal, which would have halved funding for the community policing program. But this proposal wasn\u2019t enacted, and it did not amount to an \"elimination.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in remarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe program is smaller than it was in its early years, when its budget ranged between $1.2 billion and $1.6 billion, and crime rates were higher. But funding was never zeroed out.\u00a0\nSince 2012, which was under the Obama-Biden administration, funding has been around $200 million a year.
