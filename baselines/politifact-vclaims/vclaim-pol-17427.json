Is that fair?\"\u00a0\nIn the video, Bloomberg\u2019s question is met with silence and blank stares from the other Democrats on stage. The sound of crickets plays in the background.\n\"OK,\" he says at the end of the 25-second clip.\nAnyone? pic.twitter.com/xqhq5qFYVk\u2014 Mike Bloomberg (@MikeBloomberg) February 20, 2020 \nBloomberg\u2019s video makes it look like he left the other presidential candidates speechless for 20 seconds. But that\u2019s not what actually happened. In fact, there was a two-second pause between when the former mayor said \"Is that fair?\" and \"OK.\"\nHere are Bloomberg\u2019s full remarks, which came in response to a question about his stance on redlining:\n\n\"I've been well on the record against red-lining since I worked on Wall Street. I was against it during the financial crisis. I've been against it since.\n\"The financial crisis came about because the people that took the mortgages, packaged them, and other people bought them, those were \u2014 that's where all the disaster was. Red-lining is still a practice some places, and we've got to cut it out. But it's just not true.\n\"What I was going to say, maybe we want to talk about businesses. I'm the only one here that I think that's ever started a business. Is that fair? OK.\"\n\nHis last comment was met with laughter from the audience.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColin Schmitt\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a news conference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have scientific data, from all different levels, but particularly from the high school sports levels, from numerous different states that shows that it is safe to play what New York is considering high-risk sports.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jill Terreri Ramos \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe video was selectively edited to make Bloomberg\u2019s debate performance look better than it was \u2014 splicing together unrelated moments of expressive faces from his rivals.\nRELATED: Bloomberg on the defensive, fact-checking the Las Vegas Democratic debate\nOn Twitter, some users took it a step further, saying the clip is a \"deepfake\" and a violation of the platform\u2019s new policy against manipulated videos.\u00a0\nAccording to Twitter\u2019s policy on \"synthetic and manipulated media,\" the company is only likely to remove videos that have been \"significantly and deceptively altered or fabricated,\" \"shared in a deceptive manner\" and are \"likely to impact public safety or cause serious harm.\"\u00a0\nAs of now, Bloomberg\u2019s video does not appear to meet those standards. Twitter may label clips that meet just one of the criteria, but it has not yet done so for Bloomberg\u2019s tweet.\nA deepfake video is one that uses artificial intelligence to make it look like someone is doing or saying something that never occurred. In contrast, the clip that Bloomberg shared is an example of what the Washington Post calls \"splicing,\" or \"editing together disparate videos\" that \"fundamentally alters the story that is being told.\"\nBloomberg\u2019s video is the latest example of deceptive video editing techniques being used in the 2020 election.\nOn Feb. 6, President Donald Trump tweeted an edited video of his State of the Union address. The clip makes it look like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ripped up her copy of the speech after Trump introduced each of his guests, which included military families and a young woman receiving a scholarship.\nIn fact, Pelosi waited until the end of the address to rip up her copy. And she stood and clapped for many guests.\nPolitiFact reached out to Twitter and the Bloomberg campaign for comment, but we haven\u2019t heard back.\nOur ruling\nBloomberg tweeted a video that purports to show a 20-second pause from Democratic candidates at the Las Vegas debate after he claimed he was the only one who had started a business.\nThe video was selectively edited to splice together unrelated moments of expressive faces from his rivals. In fact, there was a two-second pause after Bloomberg brought up his business experience.\nBloomberg\u2019s video contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.
