Shortly after the beginning of August, Christ outlined a plan \"to reverse the rise of Rex Scott to property security.\" The September 4 document compared the New Democratic Party's record in this case to Scott's, saying that the cost-benefit ratio is going in the wrong direction. \"During the period of Scott, premiums increased while coverage decreased,\" according to Christ's plan. \"In other words, under Rick Scott, homeowners pay higher premiums for less coverage.\" The insurance market has been on board a racing ship for the past decade, with consumers shaking among the highest insurance costs for homeowners in the country. Do homeowners pay more for less coverage under the supervision of the current Republican Governor? It is the policy of Polyte Fact Florida to scrutinize very carefully the paper trail. Christ is no stranger to making insurance prices a campaign matter. When he conducted an electoral campaign as a Republican in 2006, he pledged to lower the rates after eight state hurricanes hit in 2004 and 2005, with premiums ever rising. He kept his promise to convene a special session of the Legislature in January 2007. The result was HB 1A, which expanded State-sponsored reinsurance (mainly insurance for insurance companies) for private transport companies, and frozen the prices of the citizen &apos; s property insurance company, the State-run insurance company, in the last resort. Because private insurance companies began to impose these high premiums, citizens took on about 400,000 additional policies between 2004 and 2007, for a total of 1.2 million properties covered by private insurance companies that sought to limit their exposure in Florida. Industry experts warned that one of the main side effects of citizen expansion was that the company would not be able to pay claims in the event of a direct hurricane, leading to an assessment of all state-wide policies. The freeze of the rate eventually extended until 2009, when Christ signed Agreement No. 1495, which was endorsed by the Legislative Council with strong support. This law has allowed the rate to increase by up to 10 per cent to help citizens become actuarially sound. In Florida, insurance prices began to rise again under Christ, although no direct hurricane shocks have occurred since 2005. Scott took office in 2011 looking to reduce the large number of citizens &apos; policies by moving to the private insurance market. In his first year, he signed 408 BS, which was praised by insurance companies and commercial groups. This is the bill that blames Christ for high premiums and low coverage; Christ challenged a similar bill towards the end of his term. Critics warned that legislation was bad for consumers because it allowed for a reduction in the overall coverage limits, limited the window for filing claims for drilling and storm damage, and limited claims for damage caused by infrastructure drilling, among other things. SB 408 also submitted requests to the Regulatory Office to increase prices by up to 15 per cent to take into account higher reinsurance costs. The Act also allows insurers to pay certain claims in actual monetary terms - i.e. the cost of the insured dwelling less depreciation - instead of the replacement value, depending on the policy. By the following year, citizens began to limit coverage to most policies to infrastructure, leaving things like balconies, umbrellas, ports and swimming pools. This has been something that private insurance companies have been doing since Hurricane Wilma in 2005. We looked at the average premiums for all private homeowners' insurance policies over the past eight years. (The Christ's plan referred to all these years, except also for the first quarter of 2014 totals, which the State Insurance Regulatory Office said were accurate.) The total exposure is the amount that both private companies and citizens were responsible for covering, while the total amount of premiums paid is the amount collected by all policies in the form of premiums. :: The State has maintained a consistent level of total policies of about $6 million during this period: total premiums paid for the year/governor on average premiums, 2007/Kristan $1,679.82 trillion, 2008 $9.6 billion/Krestan $1,463.9 trillion, 2009 $8.6 billion/Krestan $1,421.1 trillion, 2010 $1.9 billion/verification of the facts announced by Rick Scott on 25 May 2010 in a speech to young Republicans in Tampa Florida \"45 out of 50 states\" for its business regulatory climate. \u2022 27 May 2010: $1,518,1.8 trillion in 2011/Scot $1,608.1 trillion in 2012/Scot $1,670.83 trillion in 2013/Scot $1,732 trillion in 2014/Scot* $1,741.68 trillion in March 2014, excluding the State Farm. Exchange rates rose and exposure fell in 2010, Christ's last year in office, but this trend has already begun after Scott took office. Premiums continued to rise while exposure decreased by some $200 billion. Scott's goal was to reduce citizens, and this is what happened (his campaign was a promise to make citizens a \"active voice\" on Scott-O-Mitter). Government insurance has shrunk by more than 400,000 policies, largely by \"care\" clients, with private insurance companies assuming coverage on slightly different terms. While clients are allowed to refuse transformation, new policies are often less costly than citizens &apos; policies, with better marginal terms. On 4 September, on the same day that Christ issued his plan to reduce insurance prices if he chose, the State Office authorized 14 insurance companies to take over 425,000 citizen insurance policies, further reducing the State client pool and reducing the company &apos; s risk. It is the largest authorized transfer since the citizens &apos; formation in 2002, although much less likely to be transferred to private insurance companies. There is no doubt that SB 408, which was passed under the name Scott, allowed for increased rates and restricted coverage, because that was what it was supposed to do, according to the director of citizen media relations Michael Peltier. He told Bolligate Fact Florida that changes in the coverage of the hole were necessary because of the dramatic increase in often fraudulent claims. The problem has not been addressed and has become an increasing issue after the two historic hurricane seasons in 2004 and 2005, leading to legislation in 2007, which has frozen the rates. \"The rates have been raised since SB 408 and there have been more stringent policies since SB 408, but these compensate for the previous deficit,\" said Peltier. He has now said that the rates have risen and the exposure has declined, the company is in a much better position. However, not all of them are pink, because some clients are still unable to afford the coverage they need, because drilling coverage is not part of a basic policy. The insurance industry as a whole has insisted that many other factors impose sustained price increases, such as reinsurance costs and payments for other claims that go beyond hurricane damage. For example, the government consumer lawyer Steve Burgess said that companies had pointed to a sharp rise in claims for homeowners' bonds for water damage. There have been reports of lawyers convincing contractors that insurance companies have changed them to repair damage caused by pipe leaks and floods. The data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners in 2013 ranked Florida as the country &apos; s most expensive homeowner insurance. In the January 2014 report, Commissioner Kevin McCarthy stated that after years of double-digit increases, half a dozen top insurers sought or agreed to reduce future premiums between 2.4 and 9.2 per cent. The companies that initially wanted their own increases were reversed when their reinsurance savings appeared. In August, citizens demanded a reduction in the 2015 rate to about 70 per cent of their clients. The state agreed to a slightly larger break than was requested in September, and citizens were forced to retreat from a plan to raise drilling rates in Hernando province. Peltier said that the low exposure level, the 408 terms and the recent low cost of reinsurance had all helped to reduce premiums. The lack of hurricanes since 2005 has also been a major contributing factor. \"It took time,\" said Billtier. \"As SB 408 has had such an impact on our claims, we cannot expect what our losses will be. We had to wait.\" The governor, Charlie Christ, said, \"Under Rick Scott, homeowners pay higher premiums for less coverage.\" He was referring to a controversial bill signed by Scott in 2011, immediately after he took office, which made a series of changes in the insurance industry and allowed prices to be raised. The insurance industry states that these changes were necessary to remain solvent after dealing with a range of factors, including two very active hurricane seasons, a jump in claims for the pit, and high reinsurance costs. Since then, these issues have declined, and many policy makers should now have a small premium difference. Since last year, the rates have been rising in Christ &apos; s position, partly because companies sought to follow the limits imposed on them by his 2007 legislative payment after the premiums were out of control. This is some additional information that Christ did not include in his attack on Scott, but his statements are still accurate. We're mostly evaluating the statement right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07327"}
