The Mendocino Complex Fire began burning in Northern California in late July, and so far has torched over 726,000 acres \u2014 more than double the size of Los Angeles.\nFirefighters from around the state have been called to action. Among the out-of-town responders were firefighters from Santa Clara County, located in the center of Silicon Valley, about 160 miles south of the inferno.\nThe Santa Clara County fire department deployed a high-tech truck, known in firefighter jargon as an \"Incident Support Unit,\" to serve as a command-and-control center.\n\nTo work effectively, the trucks need a robust Internet signal. Its broadband hookup is used to power software like Google Sheets, which lets firefighters coordinate real-time responses.\nBut in the midst of battling the largest fire in California history, the Santa Clara County truck\u2019s Internet speed suddenly slowed to a crawl. At roughly 1/200 the original speed, firefighters would have been no worse off using a dial-up modem from the 1990s.\nSo what the heck was happening?\n\"(We)\u00a0discovered the data connection was being throttled by Verizon,\" Fire Chief Anthony Bowden said in a statement filed as part of an ongoing lawsuit against the FCC. \"These reduced speeds severely interfered with the unit\u2019s ability to function effectively.\n\"Even small delays in response translate into devastating effects,\" he added, \"including loss of property, and, in some cases, loss of life.\"\nThe throttling persisted for some time even after the firefighters complained to Verizon and told the company of their urgent need to have fast Internet restored.\nVerizon later apologized for the incident. The restrictions were in place because the firefighters had a contract that said excess data usage was subject to significantly slowed-down speeds.\nBut the company said it failed to comply with its own internal policy of taking its foot off the brake during emergencies.\n\"In supporting first responders in the Mendocino fire, we didn\u2019t live up to our own promise of service and performance excellence when our process failed some first responders on the line, battling a massive California wildfire,\" Verizon said in a statement. \"For that, we are truly sorry.\"\nThe public relations fiasco drove Verizon to vow not to throttle west coast firefighters and some other first responders. \u00a0\nBut that olive branch had limited reach. For some, the incident was the most clear-cut demonstration of the shortcomings of industry self-policing in the post-net neutrality era.\nInstead of after-the-fact corporate damage control, they argue, what\u2019s needed is to put the law back on the books.\nWhat is net neutrality anyways?\nSo would Verizon\u2019s conduct have been unlawful and punishable under net neutrality? That\u2019s the main thrust of Fight for the Future\u2019s statement.\nFor the purposes of this fact-check, you need to bear in mind a couple of net neutrality\u2019s key features. (See a more detailed explainer here.) A core idea behind net neutrality is that virtually all content will travel unimpeded around the same speed.\n\"Usually, when one thinks of a net neutrality violation, one thinks of the violation of the no blocking, no throttling, and no paid prioritization rules,\" said Blair Levin, who served as chief of staff to the FCC chairman from 1993 through 1997.\nOf those three rules, we\u2019re concerned here with only one: the ban on throttling. That rule generally prohibited Internet service providers, or ISPs, from slowing down customers\u2019 speeds.\nHowever, to give ISPs flexibility in designing service plans that would avoid network congestion, the FCC carved out an exception. ISPs could offer plans that would allow willing customers to be throttled if they exceeded their data cap.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a sense, by signing this type of contract, customers waived their right not to be throttled.\nIn addition to the no-throttling rule, you also need to know about net neutrality\u2019s \"general conduct\" rule.\nThat rule stopped companies like Verizon and Comcast from \"unreasonably interfering\" with customers\u2019 Internet access. It also created an avenue for customers file complaints to the FCC, which could trigger an investigation into an ISP\u2019s practices.\nOne way to think about net neutrality with respect to ISPs is that it gave the FCC teeth. Net neutrality\u2019s repeal, in turn, largely defanged it.\nSo would the FCC have taken a bite out of Verizon if the old rules were still in play?\nThe no-throttling rule\nThe contract between Verizon and the California firefighters allowed throttling for excessive data use. In other words, the firefighters waived their right not to be throttled over their limit.\nUnder the $37.99-per-month plan, the department would get high-speed broadband for the first 25 gigabytes. Data use beyond that was subject to speed reductions.\nThe device installed in the California firefighter\u2019s high-tech truck can use up to 5-10 gigabytes per day. At that rate, the firefighters quickly hit their cap.\nTo some experts, the incident was simply the culmination of a series of mistakes \u2014 not a poster child for stronger regulation.\n\"What really happened wasn\u2019t a net neutrality issue,\" Berin Szoka, a tech lawyer and president of the group TechFreedom, wrote. \"The (fire department) simply chose a data plan for their mobile command and control unit that was manifestly inappropriate for their needs.\"\nWhat\u2019s clear is that because the firefighters\u2019 service plan permitted the kind of speed restrictions that were allowed under the old rules, Verizon did not directly violate net neutrality\u2019s no-throttling rule.\n\"The throttling incident, while a real PR disaster for Verizon, has nothing to do with net neutrality,\" said Doug Brake, the director of broadband and spectrum policy at the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation. \"The rules explicitly allowed for data plans that rate-limit or \u2018throttle\u2019 a data connection after a certain threshold.\"\nA spokeswoman for the Republican-majority FCC pointed out that\u00a0the Santa Clara County fire department, which is party to a lawsuit against the FCC to restore net neutrality, does not argue the no-throttling rule was violated here.\n\"What happened had nothing to do with net neutrality,\" she said.\u00a0\"Verizon was not discriminating on the basis of content, application, service or device.\"\u00a0\nEven the group behind the claim we\u2019re checking, Fight for the Future, conceded the narrow\u00a0point about the contract falling under the no-throttling exception.\nEvan Greer, Fight for the Future\u2019s deputy director, told us, \"Verizon's throttling of firefighters was not a direct violation of the \u2018no throttling\u2019 rule since it related to a data cap.\"\nThe \u2018general conduct\u2019 rule\nBut there\u2019s another rule that could have ensnared Verizon: The \"general conduct\" rule.\nThis prohibited companies like Verizon and Comcast from \"unreasonably interfering\" with customers\u2019 Internet access. It also created an avenue for customers to file complaints to the FCC.\nBut the repeal of net neutrality choked off this avenue.\n\"Under the 2015 rules, the firefighters could have filed a complaint with the FCC on grounds that the throttling was \u2018unjust and unreasonable,\u2019 \" said Chip Stewart, a communication technology expert and professor at Texas Christian University. \"After the current FCC repealed those rules, that is no longer an option.\"\nGigi Sohn, who was a counselor to the FCC chairman while the net neutrality rules were written, said she believes the firefighters \"could have made a persuasive case\" if that option were available today.\n\"The throttling of the Santa Clara County FPD\u2019s broadband service was a disaster waiting to happen,\" Sohn wrote in an essay for NBC News. \"In the absence of net neutrality rules and without strong FCC oversight, broadband providers like Verizon, Comcast and AT&T are free to run their networks as they please without regard to consumers, competition or public safety.\"\nHarold Feld, the senior vice president at the liberal Public Knowledge, said the key point comes down to whether or not there\u2019s a process for aggrieved consumers to get a fair hearing.\n\"It\u2019s not just about whether Verizon behaved appropriately or not,\" he told PolitiFact, citing a blog post he wrote. \"It\u2019s about having clear rules and procedures in place so that when an emergency like this happens, people know what to do and can resolve the problem quickly.\"\nSome tech experts say additional oversight is unnecessary because companies are capable of policing themselves. (Verizon has promised to do so with more verve in the future, for instance.) But not all agree.\n\"The removal of the 'cop on the beat' may have contributed to Verizon acting in ways that even it now admits was dumb,\" Levin said. \"If there is no one watching, people act differently than if they think someone is watching.\"\nOur ruling\nFight for the Future said, \"We saw the true danger of the FCC's net neutrality repeal when Verizon was caught throttling California fire fighters.\"\nUnder net neutrality, the firefighters could have filed a complaint against Verizon to the FCC, which at the very least would have launched an investigation, experts said. Repeal of the rules removed that avenue, thereby sidelining the FCC from serving as a \"cop on the beat.\"\nHowever, the firefighters\u2019 service plan permitted the kind of speed restrictions that were allowed under the old rules. So the company did not violate net neutrality\u2019s no-throttling rule.\nThe claim is partially accurate but leaves out important context.
