The richest Americans carried most of the goods. \"We've taken the poor out of the rolls. They don't pay income tax anymore. During the October 11, Paul said that most people whose income is less than $50,000 pay no income tax. \"The biggest 1% in our country pays 40%.\" At that stage, the public began to object, and the co-host of Sunny Houston to Pauls said, \"Our viewers say this is not true.\" But Paul doubled. \"The IRS statistics say that the highest 1% in our country pays 40% of the income tax,\" he said. We looked into it and found that the senator was pretty much right. When we arrived at Paul &apos; s office, they said that he was referring to the latest projections of the year 2019 by the Joint Tax Commission, the official rule of tax analysis in Congress. With regard to the federal income tax, the Committee found that each income group with a value of less than $50,000 paid an average negative share of the income burden. Overall, this means that families in these income groups have received discounts and credits that have reduced their federal liability for income tax to below zero. At the same time, the same analysis provided an overview of the tax burden borne by the largest 1.2 per cent of tax reporters, who earn at least $500,000. This group of elites together paid 51.5 per cent of the country &apos; s individual income tax bill. This is a larger share than Paul said. So if you look at the federal income tax, Paul's comment on the point of view is on the target. What about the other taxes? Individual taxes are not the only ones paid by Americans. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 January 11, 2012, if you count in other federal taxes, including taxes on salaries and fees, the numbers change. The Joint Tax Commission itself found that those who received less than $50,000 paid 4.3 per cent of all federal taxes. This remains a relatively light burden, as these taxpayers earned 13 per cent of all income generated. For Americans who earn more than $500,000, their share of the tax burden falls to 30.7% once they add to these other federal taxes. Other analyses supported in some other analyses are generally consistent with the Joint Commission's statements and Paul's statement. An annual analysis by the Tax Service found that the highest 1 per cent in 2017 paid 38.5 per cent of federal income taxes. Taxpayers earning less than $50,000 paid 5.98 per cent of income taxes. (Nothing, as Paul said, but not nearly as much.) At the same time, the Inter-Urban Institute/Brookings Foundation Centre for Tax Policy, a non-partisan think tank, estimated the distribution of all federal taxes in 2019. The Centre found that those who earn up to $50,000 in income collectively paid about 4.2% of all federal taxes, while the highest 1% paid about 27% of all federal taxes. These are averages, and individual tax burdens can vary. Mark Mazur, Director of the Centre for Tax Policy, said: \"The results depend on the specific situations faced by taxpayers, such as whether they have children or not.\" The Governor Paul said that \"most people whose income is less than $50,000 pay no income tax. The top 1% of our country pays 40%.\" Because he confined his comments to federal income tax, Paul's figures are generally accurate, and even reduce the tax burden on the first 1 percent. The picture changes once it includes other types of federal taxes. Those under $50,000 continue to pay a small share of the entire federal tax burden, but the share of the largest 1 per cent falls to about 30 per cent. Therefore, Paul &apos; s statement is accurate but requires additional information. We're mostly evaluating the statement right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00047"}
