The fare-free shuttle runs Friday and Saturday evenings, allowing Pittsburghers to\u00a0leave their cars\u00a0at the Second Avenue Parking Plaza to go to the nightlife on East Carson Street and the surrounding\u00a0South Side Flats.\nIt\u2019s part of a \"public safety strategy designed as a transportation strategy,\" Kraus told\u00a0The Incline,\u00a0adding that vehicle break-ins are the most frequent\u00a0crime in the South Side Flats \u2014\u00a0and overall in the city. Within the Flats, assault is the No. 2 crime (if simple and aggravated assaults are combined), Kraus said.\n\"Data shows that vehicle break-in is the No. 1 crime in the city, but also the No. 1 crime in the South Side Flats, and it\u2019s closely followed by assault. So it\u2019s always been my dream that if we take cars out of residential areas, put them in a single, secure lighted location, they\u2019re easier to patrol, there\u2019s less chance of miscreant behavior, and I\u2019m hoping at the end of the year to show a drastic reduction in vehicle break-ins,\" Kraus said.\nWhile the Nite Ride and other changes, including extended parking meter hours, are designed to make it easier and more inviting to go to the South Side business district, we wondered,\u00a0are vehicle\u00a0break-ins really the top crime in the South Side Flats? And in the city?\nKraus told\u00a0The Incline\u00a0that he based his statement on conversations with Zone 3 Pittsburgh Police\u00a0Commander Karen Dixon, and the data they discussed\u00a0is reflected in the police bureau\u2019s Annual Report.\nThe most current version of that report available is from 2015. In\u00a0it, police breakdown reported\u00a0crimes into 24 categories, plus an \"other\" section.\nOf the 24 specific crimes, theft was No. 1 in\u00a02015 with\u00a07,101 reported incidents out of the year\u2019s total of 30,900 reports.\nThose numbers are tabulated based on reports to police.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPat Toomey\n\n\nstated on January 19, 2021 in a hearing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere will be several thousand dollars in payments going to families with six-figure incomes who\u2019ve had no income interruption whatsoever.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jessica Calefati \u2022 January 21, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut\u00a0theft is a broad category that includes more than just\u00a0vehicle break-ins.\u00a0In 2015, there were 2,311 reports of vehicle break-ins or \"theft from auto,\" as police call it, per Emily Schaffer, spokeswoman for the public safety department.\nWhen theft is split into those two categories \u2014 theft from auto and other theft \u2014 that puts theft from auto as the fourth\u00a0most common crime in 2015, behind simple assault at No. 1 (5,446), followed by other theft (4,790) and vandalism (3,507).\nIn the report\u2019s neighborhood breakdown, theft was also No. 1 for 2015 at 505. Of those, 190 were \"theft from auto\" per Schaffer.\nUsing the same list of 24 specific crimes for 2015, after theft is public drunkenness in second with 323 incidents, and in third, 310 simple assault incidents.\u00a0However, combining simple assault with the 61 aggravated assaults brings it to No. 2, as Kraus said, with a total of 371 assaults.\nBut, split\u00a0theft from auto and other theft, and vehicle break-ins\u00a0come in at No. 5. First is 323 incidents of public drunkenness, second is 315 reported thefts, third is 310 reports\u00a0of simple assault and fourth is 211 reports of vandalism.\u00a0If aggravated and simple assaults\u00a0are combined, it becomes the most common crime in the South Side Flats in 2015, followed by public drunkenness, other theft, vandalism and theft from auto.\nOur ruling\nWhen\u00a0theft is split into \"theft from auto\" and \"other theft,\" vehicle break-ins fall to the fourth\u00a0most common crime across the city and No. 5 in the South Side Flats. That\u00a0split also makes simple and aggravated\u00a0assaults the\u00a0most common crime\u00a0in the neighborhood for 2015.\nThe councilmember would have been on firm ground if he\u00a0had said theft \u2014 the category vehicle break-ins falls into \u2014 was the most common crime in the city and South Side Flats.\u00a0When looking at the overall theft category and combining\u00a0the two assault categories, theft does become the most common crime,\u00a0and Kraus also would be\u00a0correct that the second most common crime in the Flats is assault.\nWe rule the claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03447"}
