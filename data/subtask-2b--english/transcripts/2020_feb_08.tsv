1	George S.	Candidates, welcome.
2	George S.	Vice President Biden, the first question is for you.
3	George S.	In the last few days, you’ve been saying that Democrats will be taking too big a risk if they nominate Senator Sanders or Mayor Buttigieg, but they came out on top in Iowa.
4	George S.	What risks did the Iowa Democrats miss?
5	Joe Biden	Oh, they didn’t miss anything.
6	Joe Biden	It’s a long race.
7	Joe Biden	I took a hit in Iowa and I’ll probably take a hit here.
8	Joe Biden	Traditionally Bernie won by 20 points last time.
9	Joe Biden	And usually it’s the neighboring senators that do well.
10	Joe Biden	But no matter what, I’m still in this for the same reason, we have to restore the soul of this country, bring back the middle class and make sure we bring people together.
11	Joe Biden	And so it’s a simple proposition.
12	Joe Biden	It doesn’t matter whether it’s this one or the next.
13	Joe Biden	I’ve always viewed the first four encounters, two primaries, and two caucuses as the starting point.
14	Joe Biden	And so that’s how I view it.
15	George S.	Why are Senator Sanders and Mayor Buttigieg too big a risk for Democrats?
16	Joe Biden	Well, you know that with regard to Senator Sanders, the President wants very much to sic a label on every candidate.
17	Joe Biden	We’re going to not only have to win this time, we have to bring along the United States Senate.
18	Joe Biden	And Bernie’s labeled himself, not me, a democratic socialist.
19	Joe Biden	I think that’s the label that the President’s going to lay on everyone running with Bernie if he’s a nominee.
20	Joe Biden	And a Mayor Buttigieg is a great guy and a real patriot.
21	Joe Biden	He’s a mayor of a small city, who has done some good things but has not demonstrated he has the ability to, and we’ll soon find out, to get a broad scope of support across the spectrum, including African Americans and Latinos.
22	George S.	Senator Sanders, let me give you the chance to respond first.
23	George S.	President Trump certainly thinks this label socialism will work.
24	George S.	At the State of the Union, he said, “Socialism destroys nations.
25	George S.	He’s never going to let socialism destroy American healthcare.” And before the Super Bowl, he joked was Sean Hannity about your honeymoon in Moscow.
26	George S.	Those hits are going to keep coming if you’re the nominee.
27	George S.	Why shouldn’t Democrats be worried?
28	Bernie Sanders	Because Donald Trump lies all the time.
29	Bernie Sanders	It doesn’t matter what Donald Trump says, it’s a sad state of affairs, it really is.
30	Bernie Sanders	He will say terrible things about Joe, he has [inaudible 00:02:32] ugly, disgusting things about Elizabeth, about Amy, about anybody else who was up here.
31	Bernie Sanders	But I think George, that at the end of the day, the way we defeat Donald Trump and everybody up here by the way, is united.
32	Bernie Sanders	No matter who wins this damn thing, we’re all going to stand together to defeat Donald Trump.
33	Bernie Sanders	I believe that the way we beat Trump is by having the largest voter turnout in the history of this country.
34	Bernie Sanders	And that is appealing to working class people, who have given up on the political process because they don’t believe that anybody is hearing their pain, perceiving that pain, feeling their pain.
35	Bernie Sanders	And we got to bring young people into the political process.
36	Bernie Sanders	I am very proud that in Iowa we won the popular vote by 6,000 votes.
37	Bernie Sanders	What was most significant, most significant, is we increased voter turnout for young people under 29 by over 30%.
38	Bernie Sanders	If we do that nationally, we’re going to defeat Donald Trump.
39	George S.	But Senator, let me follow up there and then we’ll move on.
40	George S.	But back in Iowa, the turn out this year was about the same as it was in 2016.
41	George S.	Far below what it was in 2008 when President Obama won.
42	Bernie Sanders	That’s true.
43	Bernie Sanders	And that’s the disappointment and I think all of us probably could have done a better job in bringing out our supporters.
44	Bernie Sanders	But if there is a good spot, a good aspect about that campaign, is that young people came out in higher numbers than they did during Obama’s historic 2008 campaign.
45	Bernie Sanders	And if that happens nationally, we’re going to win and defeat Trump.
46	George S.	Before I move on to Mayor Buttigieg, let me just ask, is anyone else on the stage concerned about having a democratic socialist at the top of the Democratic ticket?
47	Bernie Sanders	I’m not.
48	George S.	Senator Klobuchar.
49	Amy Klobuchar	Bernie and I work together all the time.
50	Amy Klobuchar	But I think we are not going to be able to out divide the divider in chief.
51	Amy Klobuchar	And I think we need someone to head up this ticket that actually brings people with her, instead of shutting them out.
52	Amy Klobuchar	And when I look at a state like New Hampshire that had a very, very close election last time in 2016, I see a state that, yes, has a high voter turnout, fired-up Democrats just like my state, which by the way, Bernie, when I led the ticket, had the highest voter turnout of any state in the country.
53	Amy Klobuchar	But I add to that being able to bring in independents like you have in this state as well as moderate Republicans.
54	Amy Klobuchar	Because there are so many of them out there that are looking for a candidate.
55	Amy Klobuchar	And truthfully, Donald Trump’s worst nightmare is a candidate that will bring people in from the middle.
56	Amy Klobuchar	The people that are tired of the noise and the nonsense.
57	Amy Klobuchar	And they are tired of the tweets and the mean stuff and they are looking for someone else.
58	Amy Klobuchar	And I would submit that that is me.
59	George S.	Mr. Steyer, is socialism [inaudible 00:05:33]
60	Tom Steyer	I don’t think there’s any question, George, that after this week there’s a real threat that Donald Trump can get reelected.
61	Tom Steyer	And I don’t think there’s any question, but that the only way that we’re going to beat him actually is the way that Bernie Sanders said, which is to get turnout across the spectrum of democratic voters.
62	Tom Steyer	And that means we’re going to have to appeal across the spectrum, moderates, progressives and every group.
63	Tom Steyer	So unless you can appeal to the diverse parts of the Democratic Party, including specifically the black community, including specifically Latinos.
64	Tom Steyer	If you can’t do that, then we can’t beat Donald Trump in November and we can’t choose a candidate who can’t do that.
65	Tom Steyer	And I am doing that right now with 24% of blacks down in South Carolina, with high numbers in Nevada.
66	Tom Steyer	That’s what it’s going to take is turnout, but turnout across the spectrum of democratic voters.
67	Tom Steyer	Someone who can pull, as Amy said, everything together in every single way we’re divided.
68	George S.	Andrew Yang and Senator Warren then Mayor Buttigieg.
69	Andrew Yang	First, let me say America, it’s great to be back on the debate stage.
70	Andrew Yang	Thank you.
71	Andrew Yang	I’m so excited, I want to give every American $1,000 a month.
72	Andrew Yang	George, the entire capitalism, socialism dichotomy is completely out of date and the fact is when people were talking about these economic models, they did not foresee technology getting stronger, more powerful, capable of doing the work of thousands of humans in the blink of an eye.
73	Andrew Yang	We have record high corporate profits in this country right now, but people in New Hampshire know, what else are at record highs?
74	Andrew Yang	Mental illness, stress, debt, substance abuse, overdoses, suicides.
75	Andrew Yang	What we have to do is actually get the markets working to improve our family’s way of life.
76	Andrew Yang	Instead of following GDP and corporate profits off a cliff, we should be measuring our own health and wellness, life expectancy, mental health and freedom from substance abuse, clean air, and clean water, how our kids are doing.
77	Andrew Yang	The way forward is a new human centered version of capitalism that actually uses the markets to improve our family’s lives.
78	George S.	Senator Warren, you reportedly said back in 2018, “I’m a capitalist to my bones.” Senator Sanders says, “I’m not.” Is that your biggest difference with Senator Sanders?
79	Elizabeth Warren	Oh, Bernie and I have been friends for a long time and we have a lot of things in common and we can have a lot of things that we differ on.
80	Elizabeth Warren	But there’s fundamental question about how we bring our party together.
81	Elizabeth Warren	We have to think about it in new ways.
82	Elizabeth Warren	People across this country, whether they’re Democrats, independents, or Republicans, understand that we’ve got a government right now that works great for those at the top.
83	Elizabeth Warren	Works great for giant drug companies, just not for people trying to get a prescription filled.
84	Elizabeth Warren	Works great for oil companies that want to drill everywhere, just not for the rest of us who see climate change bearing down upon us.
85	Elizabeth Warren	When you see a government that works great for those who can hire armies of lobbyists and lawyers and make big campaign donations and it’s not working so great for everyone else, that is corruption, pure and simple, and we need to call it out for what it is.
86	Elizabeth Warren	Corruption, and that’s what we can run on.
87	Elizabeth Warren	We bring our party together.
88	Elizabeth Warren	It’s an issue we can all agree on and fight for to end the corruption.
89	Elizabeth Warren	We’re the Democrats, we should be the party on the side of hardworking people and we can bring in independents and Republicans on that.
90	Elizabeth Warren	They hate the corruption as well.
91	Elizabeth Warren	My anti-corruption plan, good for Republicans and Democrats.
92	Elizabeth Warren	That’s not only how we bring our party together.
93	Elizabeth Warren	That’s how we’re going to win in November.
94	George S.	Mayor Buttigieg, early in the campaign you said that the word socialism has lost its power, it’s mostly lost its meaning.
95	George S.	Do you believe that or worry it could be a potent weapon in a general election?
96	Pete Buttigieg	I’m not interested in the labels.
97	Pete Buttigieg	I’m not interested in what Republicans are going to say.
98	Pete Buttigieg	I’m interested in the style of politics that we need to put forward to actually, finally turn the page.
99	Pete Buttigieg	In order to win, yes, but also in order to govern.
100	Pete Buttigieg	This is a moment where the next president is going to face challenges the likes of which we hadn’t even thought of a few years or decades ago.
101	Pete Buttigieg	And politically, we’re facing a fundamentally new problem with President Donald Trump.
102	Pete Buttigieg	So the biggest risk we could take at a time like this would be to go up against that fundamentally new challenge by trying to fall back on the familiar.
103	Pete Buttigieg	Or trying to unite this country at a moment when we need that kind of unification, when our nominee is dividing people with a politics that says, if you don’t go all the way to the edge, it doesn’t count.
104	Pete Buttigieg	A politics that says, it’s my way or the highway.
105	George S.	Are you talking about Senator Sanders?
106	Pete Buttigieg	Yes.
107	Pete Buttigieg	Because we’ve got to bring as many people as we can into this process.
108	Pete Buttigieg	Look, all of us have been saying that we can build the majority that it’s going to take in order to win.
109	Pete Buttigieg	But the process of actually proving it is now underway.
110	Pete Buttigieg	And now it comes to New Hampshire, a state that thinks for itself, is not going to be told what to do by anyone and that has a very independent streak that is going to respond to those who are reaching out in a politics of addition and inclusion and belonging.
111	Pete Buttigieg	Not one that beats people over the head and says they shouldn’t even be on their side if we don’t agree 100% of the time.
112	George S.	Senator Sanders, your response.
113	Bernie Sanders	Needless to say, I’ve never said that, but let me tell you what I do say.
114	Bernie Sanders	The way you bring people together is by presenting an agenda that works for the working people of this country, not for the billionaire class.
115	Bernie Sanders	The way you bring people together, Republicans, independents, Democrats, progressives, conservatives, you raise the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour.
116	Bernie Sanders	The way you bring people together is to make it clear that we’re not going to give tax breaks to billionaires and large corporations, they’re going to start paying their fair share of taxes.
117	Bernie Sanders	That’s what the American people want.
118	Bernie Sanders	And I’ll tell you something else, the way you bring people together is by ending the international disgrace of this country being the only major nation on Earth not to guarantee healthcare to all people as a human right.
119	Bernie Sanders	And you bring people together by telling the pharmaceutical industry they’re not going to charge us 10 times more for the same prescription drugs as the people in Canada that borders on New Hampshire.
120	Bernie Sanders	That’s how you bring people together and you defeat Donald Trump.
121	George S.	Mayor Buttigieg, you just heard Senator Sanders make healthcare the center of his piece.
122	George S.	Do you think his healthcare plan can bring people together?
123	Pete Buttigieg	I think there’s a better way.
124	Pete Buttigieg	It’s true, the American people are ready.
125	Pete Buttigieg	There’s a historic majority right now, even broader than what was available to President Obama a decade ago.
126	Pete Buttigieg	There is now a majority ready to act to make sure there is no such thing as an uninsured American and no such thing as an unaffordable prescription.
127	Pete Buttigieg	Just so long as we don’t command people to accept a public plan if they don’t want to.
128	Pete Buttigieg	That’s the idea of Medicare for All Who Want It.
129	Pete Buttigieg	My point is, what I am offering is campaigning for all of these things that America wants.
130	Pete Buttigieg	Yes, higher wages, doubling the rate of unionization in this country, making corporations and the wealthy pay their fair share, delivering healthcare and college affordability.
131	Pete Buttigieg	But also offering a way to do these game changing transformations that will actually galvanize and energize, not polarize the American people.
132	Pete Buttigieg	That is not only what we need in order to win, it’s what we need in order to govern and actually get these things done.
133	George S.	Vice President Biden, how do you unify the country?
134	Joe Biden	Look, Bernie says that you have to bring people together and we have to have Medicare for All.
135	Joe Biden	But Bernie says, and he says he wrote the damn thing, but he’s unwilling to sell us with the damn thing’s going to cost.
136	Joe Biden	The fact that we’re in New Hampshire, very levelheaded group of people, look at the numbers.
137	Joe Biden	How much is it going to cost?
138	Joe Biden	Who’s going to pay for it?
139	Joe Biden	It will cost more than the entire, the entire federal budget we spend now, more than entire budget.
140	Joe Biden	The idea middle class taxes aren’t going to go up is just crazy.
141	Joe Biden	When they did it in Vermont, what happened?
142	Joe Biden	They doubled the state income tax and then had a 14% tax on withholding.
143	Joe Biden	And they finally did away with it.
144	Joe Biden	So how much is it going to cost?
145	Joe Biden	When you ask Bernie that, and I’ll ask him again tonight sometime, and if you ask Bernie that, he says, “Go figure, I don’t know, we’ll find out.”
146	Joe Biden	I think that was on CBS.
147	Joe Biden	He said, ” We’ll find out.” Or something to that effect.
148	Joe Biden	Imagine you’re going to unite the country walking into the Congress, “I got this bill.
149	Joe Biden	It’s going to require Medicare for everybody.
150	Joe Biden	I can’t tell you how much it’s going to cost.
151	Joe Biden	We’ll find out later and it’s likely to be double whatever … everything we spent in the federal government.” Who do you think is going to get that passed?
152	Joe Biden	I busted my neck getting Obamacare passed, getting every Democratic vote.
153	Joe Biden	I know how hard it is.
154	George S.	Senator Sanders.
155	Bernie Sanders	Well, for a start, what the studies show, if we do what Joe wants, we’ll be spending some $50 trillion on healthcare over the next 10 years.
156	Bernie Sanders	That’s the status quo, Joe.
157	Bernie Sanders	That’s what Health and Human Services says.
158	Bernie Sanders	[crosstalk 00:15:15] And what we have got to do Joe, and what we have got to do is understand, simple question, Joe, we are spending twice as much per capita on healthcare as do the people of any other country.
159	Bernie Sanders	Maybe it has something to do with the fact that the healthcare industry last year made $100 billion in profit.
160	Bernie Sanders	Maybe it has something to do with the fact that we are wasting $500 billion a year trying to administer thousands and thousands of different plans.
161	Bernie Sanders	What Medicare for All will do is save the average American substantial sums of money.
162	Bernie Sanders	Substantial, be much less expensive than your plan.
163	Bernie Sanders	And we will expand Medicare to include dental care, eyeglasses, hearing aides and home health care as well.
164	George S.	Vice President Biden, 30 second response, then Senator Klobuchar after that.
165	Joe Biden	30 second-
166	George S.	Yeah, 30 second-
167	Joe Biden	30 second response.
168	Joe Biden	My proposal gives you a choice.
169	Joe Biden	You’re going to be covered.
170	Joe Biden	You have Medicare if you want it, you turn [inaudible 00:16:16] we’re going to restore all the cuts that they made in Obamacare.
171	Joe Biden	We’re going to reduce drug prices, reduce prescription prices, reduce copays, et cetera.
172	Joe Biden	And it cost a lot of money, it costs $750 billion over 10 years.
173	Joe Biden	I tell you how I’m going to pay for it.
174	Joe Biden	I’m going to raise the capital gains rates, you pay capital gains and what your tax rate is.
175	Joe Biden	That’ll pay for it, that’s $800 billion.
176	Joe Biden	But here’s the deal, the fact is that it’s going to cost … Bernie’s plan costs double, double what the taxpayers are paying for every single program we spend on in the United States of America.
177	George S.	Senator Klobuchar.
178	Amy Klobuchar	I keep listening to this same debate, and it is not real.
179	Amy Klobuchar	It is not real, Bernie, because two thirds of the Democrats in the Senate are not on your bill and because it would kick 149 million Americans off their current health insurance in four years.
180	Amy Klobuchar	And let me say what else, Elizabeth wants to do it in two years.
181	Amy Klobuchar	And Pete, while you have a different plan now you sent out a tweet just a few years ago that said, henceforth, forewith, indubitably, affirmatively, you are for Medicare for All for the ages.
182	Amy Klobuchar	And so I would like to point out that what leadership is about is taking a position, looking at things and sticking with them.
183	Amy Klobuchar	I have long believed that the way that we expand healthcare to more people and bring down premiums is by building on the Affordable Care Act, with a nonprofit public option.
184	Amy Klobuchar	That is the best way to do it.
185	Amy Klobuchar	And practically look at this, the Affordable Care Act is now nearly 10 points more popular than the President of United States.
186	Amy Klobuchar	So why would we talk about blowing it up?
187	Amy Klobuchar	What we need to do is build on it.
188	Amy Klobuchar	Mental health care, addiction, longterm care, those are the things that would make it better for everyone.
189	George S.	Senator Warren and Mayor Buttigieg, you were both invoked.
190	George S.	I want you each to respond and then go back to Senator Sanders.
191	Elizabeth Warren	So I think we need to think about healthcare a little differently and that is, 36 million Americans last year couldn’t afford to have a prescription filled and that includes people with health insurance.
192	Elizabeth Warren	I want everyone in here to think about what that means.
193	Elizabeth Warren	They were worried enough or sick enough that they went to a doctor, a doctor looked at it and says that’s serious enough to write a prescription.
194	Elizabeth Warren	They walked out and then said, it’s either that or groceries.
195	Elizabeth Warren	It’s that or pay them rent on time.
196	Elizabeth Warren	We have got to change our healthcare system.
197	Elizabeth Warren	The way [no audio or video 00:18:34] Help to the most people as quickly as we can.
198	Elizabeth Warren	How about we start with what a president can do, I love saying this, all by herself.
199	Elizabeth Warren	On day one, I will defend the Affordable Care Act and I will use march in orders to reduce the cost of commonly used prescription drugs like insulin and HIV, AIDS, drugs and EpiPens.
200	Elizabeth Warren	We can start making healthcare better for Americans from the beginning, but we have to agree to do that.
201	Elizabeth Warren	We are the Democrats, we are on the side of expanding healthcare.
202	Elizabeth Warren	When we come up against Donald Trump, the team that has been trying to take away healthcare from millions of people, what’s going to matter most is we are the people on the side of those who need healthcare across this country.
203	Elizabeth Warren	That’s who Democrats are.
204	George S.	Mayor Buttigieg, I want you to respond to that, but also take on the argument at the beginning from the Vice President, you don’t have the right experience to be president.
205	Pete Buttigieg	Sure.
206	Pete Buttigieg	Well, first of all, just to be clear, the truth is that I have been consistent throughout in my position on delivering healthcare for every American.
207	Pete Buttigieg	And as to experience, I just bring a different perspective.
208	Pete Buttigieg	Look, I freely admit that if you’re looking for the person with the most years of Washington establishment experience under their belt, you’ve got your candidate, and of course it’s not me.
209	Pete Buttigieg	The perspective I’m bringing is that of somebody whose life has been shaped by the decisions that are made in those big white buildings in Washington, D.C. Somebody who has guided a community written off as dying just a decade ago through historic transformation.
210	Pete Buttigieg	Somebody who knows what it means to be sent to war on orders that come out of the Situation Room.
211	Pete Buttigieg	We need a perspective right now that will finally allow us to leave the politics of the past in the past.
212	Pete Buttigieg	Turn the page and bring change to Washington before it’s too late.
213	George S.	Vice President Biden, there’s his answer.
214	Joe Biden	The politics of the past I think were not all that bad.
215	Joe Biden	I wrote the Violence Against Women Act.
216	Joe Biden	I managed the $900 billion Recovery Act, which in fact put millions and millions of dollars into his city before he came and helped save his city.
217	Joe Biden	I was able to do it, I was able to pass the chemical weapons ban, arms control.
218	Joe Biden	And I was the first major leader holding public office to call for same sex marriage.
219	Joe Biden	So I don’t know what about the past of Barack Obama and Joe Biden was so bad.
220	Joe Biden	What happened?
221	Joe Biden	What is it that he wants to do away with?
222	Joe Biden	We were just beginning.
223	Joe Biden	… Happened, what is it that he wants to do away with?
224	Joe Biden	We were just beginning.
225	Joe Biden	It was just the beginning of what will be the future of moving this country beyond where it is now in significant ways, and there’s ways to do that, and one of the ways to do that is to make sure you have someone who knows how to get things done, and can lead the free world at the same time.
226	George S.	Mayor Buttigieg respond, and then Senator Sanders.
227	Pete Buttigieg	Those achievements were phenomenally important, because they met the moment, but now we have to meet this moment.
228	Pete Buttigieg	And this moment is different.
229	Pete Buttigieg	The next president is going to face challenges from global health security, like what we’re seeing coming out of China, to cybersecurity, and election security challenges that were barely thought of a few years ago.
230	Pete Buttigieg	And here at home, we’re seeing things like gig work, transform what it means to be a worker in America, in ways that were barely conceived of not that long ago.
231	Pete Buttigieg	We cannot solve the problems before us by looking back.
232	Pete Buttigieg	We have to be ready to turn the page, and change our politics before it’s too late.
233	Pete Buttigieg	And I’m seeing everywhere I go, not just fellow Democrats, but a striking number of independents, and, what I like to call future former Republicans ready to join in that historic American majority to turn the page.
234	George S.	Senator Klobuchar.
235	Amy Klobuchar	I am listening to this about meeting the moment, and my first thought is, I’m a fresh face up here for a presidential debate, and I figure, Pete, that 59, my age, is the new 38 up here.
236	Amy Klobuchar	The second thing I think about is this, and that is-
237	Bernie Sanders	70 is the new 50.
238	Amy Klobuchar	Okay, there you go.
239	Amy Klobuchar	Meeting the moment, meeting the moment, we had a moment the last few weeks, mayor, and that moment was these impeachment hearings.
240	Amy Klobuchar	And there was a lot of courage that you saw from only a few people.
241	Amy Klobuchar	There was courage from Doug Jones, our friend of Alabama, who took that tough vote.
242	Amy Klobuchar	There was courage from Mitt Romney, who took it very, very difficult vote.
243	Amy Klobuchar	There was courage, as I read today, about Lieutenant Colonel Vindman being escorted out of the White House, what he did took courage.
244	Amy Klobuchar	But what you said, Pete, as you were campaigning through Iowa, as three of us were jurors in that impeachment hearing, you said it was exhausting to watch, and that you wanted to turn the channel and watch cartoons.
245	Amy Klobuchar	It is easy to go after Washington, because that’s a popular thing to do.
246	Amy Klobuchar	It is much harder, as I see Senator Shaheen in the front row, such a leader, it is much harder to lead, and much harder to take those difficult positions.
247	Amy Klobuchar	Because I think this going after every single thing that people do, because it’s popular to say, and makes you look like a cool newcomer.
248	Amy Klobuchar	I just, I don’t think that’s what people want right now.
249	Amy Klobuchar	We have a newcomer in the White House, and look where it got us.
250	Amy Klobuchar	I think having some experience is a good thing.
251	Bernie Sanders	George, George, can I…
252	George S.	Senator Sanders, then Mayor Buttigieg.
253	Andrew Yang	George, can I say…
254	Bernie Sanders	Look, at the end of the day, we got to ask ourselves a very simple question, whether it’s healthcare in fact, or anything else.
255	Bernie Sanders	Why are we the only major country on earth that doesn’t guarantee healthcare to all people?
256	Bernie Sanders	Pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs?
257	Bernie Sanders	Have 87 million people uninsured or under-insured?
258	Bernie Sanders	30,000 die because they don’t get to a doctor on time, and 500,000 people going bankrupt, for what reason?
259	Bernie Sanders	Because they have cancer or heart disease, or Alzheimer’s.
260	Bernie Sanders	We got to ask that question, why is it why?
261	Bernie Sanders	Why have we been talking about healthcare in this country for a hundred years, and here is the answer.
262	Bernie Sanders	If you want real change in healthcare, at the end of the day, you’re going to have to take on the insurance companies, and tell them the function of healthcare is healthcare for all, not huge profits for the insurance companies.
263	Bernie Sanders	You’re going to have to take on the drug companies, and their corruption, and their price fixing, and tell them, “Sorry, we’re not going to pay 10 times more for prescription drugs, than do the people of other country.” But at the end of the day, there’s no way around it.
264	Bernie Sanders	You may want to nibble around the edges, but ultimately, you need to rally the American people to tell the drug companies, to tell Wall Street, to tell the insurance companies, to tell the fossil fuel industry this country belongs to all of us, not a handful of special interests.
265	George S.	Mayor Buttigieg, wrap this up, and then-
266	Tom Steyer	I have heard this conversation on this debate stage from these people now every single debate, and they’re all right, everybody on this stage is better on economic justice and healthcare than anybody in the Republican party, and a million times better than Donald Trump.
267	Tom Steyer	That is not the question in front of us today.
268	Tom Steyer	The question in front of us today is, how are we going to beat Donald Trump?
269	Tom Steyer	You were in the Clinton campaign in 1992, and the mantra was, “It’s the economy, stupid.” Well, if you look at what Mr. Trump is saying, he’s saying those words, “It’s the economy, stupid.” I trust every one of these people a million times more, but we’re going to have to take Mr. Trump down on the economy, because if you listen to him, he’s crowing about it every single day, and he’s going to beat us unless we can take him down on the economy, stupid.
270	Tom Steyer	And that’s the issue here.
271	Tom Steyer	It is not about who has the best healthcare plan.
272	Tom Steyer	All the healthcare plans are better, a million times better.
273	Tom Steyer	The question is, who can go toe to toe with Mr. Trump?
274	Tom Steyer	Who can take down Mr. Trump, because he’s the real threat to the country?
275	Tom Steyer	And let me say, you have to have experience to take him down.
276	Tom Steyer	This is not a question of he’s a nice guy who’s going to listen.
277	Tom Steyer	We need people with experience.
278	Tom Steyer	That’s why I’m worried about Mayor Pete.
279	Tom Steyer	You need to be able to go toe to toe with this guy, and take him down on the debate stage, or we’re going to lose.
280	Tom Steyer	And that’s actually the issue in front of democratic voters.
281	Tom Steyer	I have heard this debate so many darn times, and I love all these people, and they’re all right.
282	Tom Steyer	If we win, we can get the right thing, Bernie.
283	Tom Steyer	I am with you.
284	Tom Steyer	If we win, we can get the right thing, Pete, and Amy, but we got to win, or we are in deep trouble, and we keep not talking about the facts.
285	George S.	Mayor Pete.
286	Pete Buttigieg	Here’s how we’re going to win.
287	Pete Buttigieg	We’re going to force this president to stand on that debate stage, next to somebody who actually lives in a middle class neighborhood, in the industrial Midwest, in the exact kind of community that he pretends to speak for, but turns his back on.
288	Pete Buttigieg	We’re going to put up somebody who’s not afraid to call out things like his disgraceful behavior at the national prayer breakfast, and remind Americans that God does not belong to a political party.
289	Pete Buttigieg	We’re going to win by having somebody up there who can call him to account for his refusal to serve when it was his turn, and remind him what serving this country is really about.
290	Pete Buttigieg	If we want to beat this president, we’ve got to be ready to move on from the playbook that we have relied on in the past, and unify this country around a new and better vision.
291	Pete Buttigieg	That’s how we’re going to win.
292	Pete Buttigieg	And when I talk about exhaustion, this is important, because I got to tell you, the American people, from outside of Washington, we feel a sense of exhaustion watching the division, and the dysfunction there.
293	Pete Buttigieg	And that is not to take anything away from the very good work that you and our other democratic members of Congress, and the Senate are doing.
294	Pete Buttigieg	It’s not.
295	Pete Buttigieg	But, the reason I raise that sense of exhaustion is I see it.
296	Pete Buttigieg	I see that temptation to walk away from it all among so many people that I’ve spoken to in communities from Claremont to Manchester, and in the other states that we’re in.
297	Pete Buttigieg	And the important thing for the American people to remember, is this is 2020, it’s an election year.
298	Pete Buttigieg	And if the Senate was the jury before, you are the jury now.
299	Pete Buttigieg	The American people are the jury that will have the final verdict on this president, and on the senators in the GOP who protected him.
300	Andrew Yang	Pete, fundamentally, you are missing the lesson of Donald Trump’s victory.
301	Andrew Yang	Donald Trump is not the cause of all of our problems, and we’re making a mistake when we act like he is.
302	Pete Buttigieg	That’s right.
303	Andrew Yang	He is a symptom of a disease that has been building up in our communities for years, and decades.
304	Andrew Yang	And it is our job to get to the harder work of actually curing the disease.
305	Andrew Yang	Most Americans feel like the political parties have been playing you lose, I lose, you lose, I lose for years.
306	Andrew Yang	And you know who’s been losing this entire time?
307	Andrew Yang	We have.
308	Andrew Yang	Our communities have.
309	Andrew Yang	Our communities way of life is disintegrating beneath our feet.
310	Andrew Yang	That’s why Iowa, traditional swing state, went to Trump by almost 10 points.
311	Andrew Yang	That’s why Ohio, a traditional swing state is now so red, that I’m told we’re not even going to campaign there.
312	Andrew Yang	So, these communities are seeing their way of life get blasted into smithereens.
313	Andrew Yang	We’ve automated away four million manufacturing jobs, and counting.
314	Andrew Yang	We’re closing 30% of New Hampshire stores and malls, and Amazon, the force behind that, is literally paying zero in taxes.
315	Andrew Yang	These are the changes that Americans are seeing and feeling around us every day, and if we get done the hard work of curing those problems, we will not just defeat Donald Trump in the fall, but we’ll actually be able to move our communities forward.
316	George S.	I know we’re going to hear a lot more on this, but we’re going to move on.
317	Speaker 1	Thank you George.
318	Speaker 1	Good evening candidates.
319	Speaker 1	We come to you, of course, just 48 hours after the acquittal of President Trump.
320	Speaker 1	A process that has certainly crystallized the divide in our country.
321	Speaker 1	Senator Warren, want to start with you.
322	Speaker 1	You have said that on day one of your presidency, one of your first orders of business will be to order your justice department to launch new investigations into the Trump Administration.
323	Speaker 1	After a grueling impeachment, and what is likely to be a polarizing election, is investigating President Trump the best way to try to unify the country?
324	Elizabeth Warren	Look, I think no one is above the law, and that includes the President of the United States.
325	Elizabeth Warren	We watched on Wednesday as Republicans, all but one locked arms to protect him from impeachment, but we need to reestablish the rule of law in this country.
326	Elizabeth Warren	I believe in an independent commission, in our justice department that investigates crimes committed by our own government.
327	Elizabeth Warren	It is an important part of accountability.
328	Elizabeth Warren	It is an important part for every administration, that we hold ourselves accountable to the American people.
329	Elizabeth Warren	Look, people around this country are losing faith in our government.
330	Elizabeth Warren	They’re losing faith that government works for them.
331	Elizabeth Warren	They see a government that just works great if you’re rich.
332	Elizabeth Warren	It works great if you’re a lobbyist.
333	Elizabeth Warren	It works great if you’re a corporate executive, but they see themselves and their children with less and less and less, and we could do something about it.
334	Elizabeth Warren	It’s not enough simply to talk about the future.
335	Elizabeth Warren	We have to be willing to stand up to those who now control our government, and make that government instead work for us.
336	Elizabeth Warren	We can do child care in this country for every baby.
337	Elizabeth Warren	We can invest in our public schools.
338	Elizabeth Warren	We can cancel student loan debt for 43 million Americans, but only if we are willing to take control of our government away from the giant corporations and billionaires, return it to the people.
339	Elizabeth Warren	This is about our government.
340	Elizabeth Warren	This is about our democracy.
341	Elizabeth Warren	This is about our future.
342	Speaker 1	Mr. Yang, you said that the notion of a leader quote, throwing the president before them in jail is not the way things are done here in the United States.
343	Speaker 1	It would make it quote, very hard for any party to govern sustainably moving forward.
344	Speaker 1	Does that mean that any alleged misconduct by the president or his administration should not be investigated?
345	Andrew Yang	There are of course limits, and you have to see what the facts are on the ground after you assume office, but the fact is, if you look around the world, the countries that have thrown past presidents into jail, have generally been developing countries, and unfortunately that’s a pattern that once you establish, is very, very hard to break.
346	Andrew Yang	What’s a more American tradition?
347	Andrew Yang	We move the country forward.
348	Andrew Yang	We don’t focus on the mistakes of the leaders that are leaving office.
349	Andrew Yang	Most Americans do not care about what a particular individual did, so much as they care about their family’s wellbeing, their community, their town.
350	Andrew Yang	That’s where Americans focus wants.
351	Andrew Yang	They want the American president.
352	Andrew Yang	They want the present.
353	Andrew Yang	Of course, the American president, sorry about that.
354	Andrew Yang	They want the president to be focused on that, and that’s where our attention should be.
355	Andrew Yang	We should not fall into a pattern that has been disastrous in other countries.
356	Speaker 1	Senator Sanders.
357	Bernie Sanders	Along with Elizabeth and Amy, we sat for two weeks listening to the impeachment process, and here’s what I think the horror and the danger of what happened was not only the acquittal of Trump, who in fact committed impeachable offenses, and obstructed Congress.
358	Bernie Sanders	It is the precedent that it set.
359	Bernie Sanders	The precedent that it set.
360	Bernie Sanders	And what that precedent is about now is in the future, you’re going to have presidents who say, “Hey, governor, you want highway money?
361	Bernie Sanders	You better support me, or you’re not going to get it.” Because I am the president, I can do anything I want.
362	Bernie Sanders	Hey, Congress, you want to investigate me?
363	Bernie Sanders	Don’t be ridiculous.
364	Bernie Sanders	Who cares about the Congress?
365	Bernie Sanders	Who cares about the separation of powers?
366	Bernie Sanders	Who cares about the constitution of the president?
367	Bernie Sanders	I’m the President of the United States.
368	Bernie Sanders	I have all of the power, and I’m able to intimidate members of my own party.
369	Bernie Sanders	The saddest aspect of this whole thing, is you have Republicans in the Senate who knew better.
370	Bernie Sanders	They knew that Donald Trump is a crook.
371	Bernie Sanders	They knew that Donald Trump is a cheat, but they didn’t have the guts, with the exception of Romney to vote against him.
372	Bernie Sanders	That is a sad day.
373	Speaker 1	Mr. Steyer.
374	Tom Steyer	So, I did start the Need to Impeach movement in October of 2017.
375	Tom Steyer	And my father was one of the people who prosecuted the Nazi war criminals after World War II.
376	Tom Steyer	And that’s part of the reason I started it.
377	Tom Steyer	Because when you see something really wrong in the United States, you’re supposed to stand up against it, and fight against it.
378	Tom Steyer	And that’s what I was doing.
379	Tom Steyer	But he’s been, the Republicans have rolled over, they’ve had a sham trial, they’ve refused to have witnesses.
380	Tom Steyer	They’ve covered up the truth for the American people.
381	Tom Steyer	And it doesn’t matter anymore that he’s a crook, and he’s always been a crook, and he always will be a crook.
382	Tom Steyer	Right now, what we have to do is we have to beat him in November, and we have to beat him because he’s incompetent, and bad for the American people.
383	Tom Steyer	And that’s the case we have to make now.
384	Tom Steyer	Is he a crook?
385	Tom Steyer	I knew that two years ago.
386	Tom Steyer	Is he going to be more of a crook, now that he believes he can get away with anything?
387	Tom Steyer	Of course he is.
388	Tom Steyer	But the job of the people on this stage is to beat him in November, and that’s going to be based on what we can deliver for the American people.
389	Tom Steyer	The fact that he’s incompetent as a president, his economy isn’t delivering for working people.
390	Tom Steyer	The jobs don’t pay enough for people to live on.
391	Tom Steyer	We’ve got to take him down on the economy, and get them out of the White House as soon as possible.
392	Speaker 1	Thank you Mr. Steyer.
393	Speaker 1	Impeachment is of course over.
394	Speaker 1	But Republicans in Congress have already started investigating vice president Biden’s son, Hunter.
395	Speaker 1	Mayor Buttigieg, do you think that there’s a danger for the democratic party to nominate a candidate who is still under the threat of investigation?
396	Pete Buttigieg	No, and we’re not going to let them change the subject.
397	Pete Buttigieg	This is not about Hunter Biden, or vice president Biden, or any Biden.
398	Pete Buttigieg	This is about an abuse of power by the president.
399	Pete Buttigieg	The vice president and I and all of us are competing.
400	Pete Buttigieg	But we’ve got to draw a line here.
401	Pete Buttigieg	And to be the kind of president, to be the kind of human being who would seek to turn someone against his own son, who would seek to weaponize a son against his own father, is an unbelievably dishonorable thing, that is just one more example of why we as a party have to be completely united in doing whatever it takes at the end of the day to make sure that this president does not get a second term.
402	Speaker 1	Vice president Biden.
403	Joe Biden	I thank my colleague for saying that.
404	Joe Biden	It is a diversion, but here’s the deal.
405	Joe Biden	Whomever the nominee is, the president’s going to make up lies about.
406	Joe Biden	He thinks he has free reign right now.
407	Joe Biden	One of the things that I think is really important is we have to be authentic with the American people about what we’re going to do and how we’re going to do it.
408	Joe Biden	And by the way, Colonel Vindman got thrown out of the White House, walked out.
409	Joe Biden	I think at the same time, he should have been pinning a medal on Vindman, and not on rush Limbaugh.
410	Joe Biden	And I think we should all stand and give Colonel Vindman a show of how much we supported him.
411	Joe Biden	Stand up and clap for Vindman.
412	Joe Biden	Get up there.
413	Joe Biden	Who we are.
414	Joe Biden	That’s who we are.
415	Joe Biden	We are not what Trump is.
416	Speaker 1	Thank you Vice President Biden.
417	Speaker 1	The Democratic party’s last presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton has criticized Senator Bernie Sanders track record in the senate.
418	Bernie Sanders	I wasn’t able to hear that question.
419	Speaker 1	Okay sure.
420	Speaker 1	The democratic party’s last presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton has criticized Senator Bernie Sanders record in the senate, saying, “Nobody likes him.
421	Speaker 1	Nobody wants to work with him.
422	Speaker 1	He got nothing done.” Senator Klobuchar, you served with Senator Sanders in the Senate.
423	Speaker 1	Is he going to be able to get the support?
424	Speaker 1	Not if you like him, but is he going to be able to get the support that he needs from Republicans?
425	Amy Klobuchar	I like Bernie just fine.
426	Amy Klobuchar	We actually have worked together on a number of things, including pharmaceuticals.
427	Amy Klobuchar	We actually had a vote late at night one time, Klobuchar/ Sanders amendment to bring in less-
428	Bernie Sanders	I thought it was Sanders/Klobuchar?
429	Amy Klobuchar	Nope, nope, nope, it was not, it was not.
430	Amy Klobuchar	To bring in less expensive drugs from other countries, since in this great state of New Hampshire, like in Minnesota and Vermont, we can see Canada from our porch.
431	Amy Klobuchar	And we ended up getting I think 14 Republican votes.
432	Amy Klobuchar	And they might not have noticed what was happening late at night, but we got those.
433	Amy Klobuchar	And I think that it is just an example of what we need to do here, because I’ve been listening to this discussion.
434	Amy Klobuchar	I agree with my colleagues, we must unite, but the way that we unite is by having an optimistic economic agenda for America.
435	Amy Klobuchar	That is what we must do, and that means taking on a president, if you want to talk about being tough enough to take him on.
436	Amy Klobuchar	Taking on a president that literally went down to Mar-a-Lago after he signed that Republican tax bill, and looked at all his friends and said, “You just got a lot richer.” That is exhibit A for those carpenters in Pennsylvania, and those dairy farmers in Wisconsin, and those dock workers that I met with in Michigan.
437	Amy Klobuchar	That is an exhibit A, and we have to be able to make the case to the working people of this country, some of whom voted for Donald Trump, that we have something better to offer.
438	Amy Klobuchar	That we are going to take those incredibly regressive parts of that tax bill, and put that money into their childcare, into their healththere.
439	Speaker 1	Senator, just a quick yes or no.
440	Speaker 1	Do you think that Senator Sanders will be able to get Republican support in order to pass his bills?
441	Amy Klobuchar	That, I don’t know.
442	Amy Klobuchar	I know we did on that bill, but the point is, I think we’re better off with someone that has the receipts.
443	Amy Klobuchar	Someone that has actually won big time with Republicans and independents, and I’m the only one up on this stage, you can check it out, that has consistently won in red congressional districts.
444	Amy Klobuchar	Not once, not twice, but three times.
445	Amy Klobuchar	And when I did this, I didn’t just do it for me.
446	Amy Klobuchar	I led a ticket.
447	Amy Klobuchar	I’ve flipped the state house every single time, because I have a way of working with people, that I think should be valued here as we look at these candidates, and it’s one of the reasons that I got the New York Times endorsement, along with Elizabeth, and that I got the endorsements of the three major papers here in New Hampshire, which is the Union Leader, the Seacoast papers, and the Keene Sentinel.
448	Amy Klobuchar	I think that matters.
449	Amy Klobuchar	Read those editorials, and you will get a sense of what I’m about.
450	Speaker 1	Thank you Senator.
451	Speaker 1	Senator Sanders.
452	Bernie Sanders	I must confess, I don’t get too many newspaper editorial support.
453	Bernie Sanders	Must confess that.
454	Amy Klobuchar	Well, you the Conway endorsement.
455	Bernie Sanders	I did.
456	Bernie Sanders	We’re very proud of that.
457	Amy Klobuchar	There we go.
458	Bernie Sanders	But, let me just say this.
459	Bernie Sanders	I think the question started off with Secretary Clinton’s critique.
460	Bernie Sanders	I think, quite honestly, as we face one of the great political crises facing America, our job is to look forward and not back to 2016.
461	Bernie Sanders	And I hope that Secretary Clinton and all of us can come together, and move in that direction.
462	Bernie Sanders	Now, second of all, in terms of Republicans, let me say…
463	Bernie Sanders	-in that direction.
464	Bernie Sanders	Now, second of all, in terms of Republicans, let me say that in my own great state of Vermont, if my memory is correct, Amy, I got 25% of the Republican vote.
465	Bernie Sanders	And in fact, there were periods when I was in the House of Representatives, a number of years where I passed more amendments on the floor of the House in a bipartisan way than any other member of the House and that is when you bring people together on an issue.
466	Bernie Sanders	There are many conservative Republicans, for example, who are concerned about civil liberties, at least they used to be concerned about civil liberties.
467	Bernie Sanders	There are Republicans, as you know, who are concerned about the high cost of prescription drugs.
468	Bernie Sanders	There are ways that we can work with Republicans on issues where we have a common basis.
469	Lindsey	Thank you, Senator.
470	Bernie Sanders	Let’s do that.
471	Lindsey	David.
472	David Muir	Lindsey, thank you.
473	David Muir	Good evening, all.
474	David Muir	I want to turn to America’s role in the world and readiness to be commander-in-chief on day one.
475	David Muir	Just this week, you saw it, during the State of the Union, President Trump offered an indication of what he’ll tout on the campaign trail.
476	David Muir	He celebrated the US air strike that killed top Iranian general, Qasem Soleimani saying, “Soleimani was the Iranian regime’s most ruthless butcher, a monster who murdered or wounded thousands of American service members in Iraq.”
477	David Muir	Mayor Buttigieg, you’re the only veteran standing on this stage and while there is still debate about whether or not there was an imminent threat, there is no debate about whether or not Soleimani was a bad actor who was responsible for the deaths of many Americans.
478	David Muir	Given what you know about Soleimani, if your national security team came to you with an opportunity to strike, would Soleimani have been dead or would he still be alive under your presidency?
479	Pete Buttigieg	In the situation that we saw with President Trump’s decision, there is no evidence that that made our country safer.
480	Pete Buttigieg	Look, I feel very strongly about the campaign of murder and mayhem that General Soleimani and his units have perpetrated.
481	Pete Buttigieg	It’s also the case that if we learned nothing else from the war in Iraq, it’s that taking out a bad guy is not a good idea if you do not know what you were doing.
482	Pete Buttigieg	This president has moved us this much closer to the brink of war, but it didn’t start with the Soleimani strike.
483	Pete Buttigieg	It started with withdrawing us from the Iran nuclear deal that his own administration certified was working.
484	Pete Buttigieg	And it’s time for us to recognize that every time a step is taken that moves us to the brink of war, that has incredibly serious consequences for those who serve.
485	Pete Buttigieg	By chance, just because I was traveling for the campaign, not long ago, I ran into somebody that I hadn’t seen since we were both serving, hadn’t seen since she was injured in an insider attack.
486	Pete Buttigieg	And I saw her coming down the concourse in the airport wearing a Wounded Warrior Project tee shirt that said, “Some assembly required.” And when I asked her how she was doing, she up her knee and tapped on the part of her leg that they couldn’t save, tapped on the prosthetic and said the Navy had fixed her up just fine and then let me know that she was looking forward to an upcoming deployment.
487	Pete Buttigieg	The people in our uniform will do whatever the United States requires of them.
488	Pete Buttigieg	What they deserve in return is a president who will actually read the intelligence, pay attention to the international security situation, consult with our allies, keep US politics out of it, and never commit our troops to a situation where they would have to go into harm’s way if there is an alternative.
489	David Muir	Mayor Buttigieg, let me just press further on this though, because president Trump has signal in a general election campaign, he will celebrate his willingness to order that strike.
490	David Muir	I’m asking if your national security team came to you and presented you with the opportunity, would you take the strike?
491	Pete Buttigieg	It depends on the circumstances.
492	Pete Buttigieg	It depends if there was an alternative and it depends what the different effects would be.
493	Pete Buttigieg	That’s my point.
494	Pete Buttigieg	This is not an episode of 24.
495	Pete Buttigieg	This is a situation that requires that you actually evaluate the entire intelligence picture.
496	Pete Buttigieg	This president has insulted the intelligence community, but they put their lives on the line to gather the information that will help a decision maker evaluate whether or not something like that is justified.
497	Pete Buttigieg	And I don’t think he even reads it.
498	Pete Buttigieg	And here we have a situation where the world, that one of the most volatile places in the world has just become more dangerous at the hands of a president who has no regard for the military, not only punishing a war hero today with what he did to Colonel Vindman, but pardoning war criminals in a way that undermines the entire sense of good order and discipline and military honor.
499	Pete Buttigieg	We deserve a better commander-in-chief.
500	David Muir	Mayor Buttigieg, thank you.
501	David Muir	I do want to take this to Vice President Biden next because we know that the Obama Administration was aware of the threat that Soleimani posed, so was the Bush Administration before it.
502	David Muir	I’m asking tonight as commander-in-chief though, would you have ordered the strike?
503	Joe Biden	No.
504	Joe Biden	And the reason I wouldn’t have ordered the strike, there is no evidence yet of imminent threat that was going to come from him.
505	Joe Biden	Look what happened, his America First policies made America alone.
506	Joe Biden	You cannot think of a time, David, and as long as you’ve been alive when NATO has said to the United States of America and to Iran, made a moral equivalence and said, both of you stand down.
507	Joe Biden	We are alone now, alone in that region of the world, without friends, without support, without allies.
508	Joe Biden	And secondly, you saw what happened when that air raid, when those missiles were fired from Iran into Iraq at Al-Assad Airbase, 64 of our heroes were wounded.
509	Joe Biden	I don’t know what I would’ve done if my son were still there.
510	Joe Biden	I would have been so damn angry.
511	Joe Biden	I don’t know what I would’ve done.
512	Joe Biden	But here’s what happened, they had received traumatic brain injury.
513	Joe Biden	What did the president say?
514	Joe Biden	He said, “headaches,” “not bad,” “Headaches, that’s all they are.” This guy doesn’t deserve to be commander- in-chief for one more day.
515	David Muir	Mr. Vice President, thank you, Senator Sanders, you have called this, “assassinating a government official.” You would not have ordered the strike.
516	Bernie Sanders	Right.
517	Bernie Sanders	Look, here is the danger, David, there are very bad leaders all over the world.
518	Bernie Sanders	Kim Jong-un in North Korea is probably responsible for the death of hundreds of thousands of his people threatening all of Asia with nuclear weapons.
519	Bernie Sanders	You got Mohammad Bin Salman in Saudi Arabia who is a terrible murderer, who murdered Khashoggi in cold blood and dismembered his body.
520	Bernie Sanders	You have Putin in Russia who has been involved in political assassinations of his enemies.
521	Bernie Sanders	You got Xi in China who has put a million Muslims into concentration camps.
522	Bernie Sanders	You cannot go around saying you’re a bad guy, we’re going to assassinate you, and then you’re going to have, if that happens, you’re opening the door to international anarchy that every government in the world will then be subjected to attacks and assassination.
523	Bernie Sanders	What we have got to do, which Trump does not understand, is strengthen the State Department and our diplomatic capabilities, not just the military.
524	Bernie Sanders	What we have got to do is bring countries around the world together with our power and our wealth and say, you know what, let us sit down and work out our differences through debate and discussion at the UN, not through more and more war and the expenditures of trillions of dollars and the loss of God knows how many lives.
525	David Muir	Senator Sanders, thank you.
526	David Muir	This does take me to Afghanistan and to America’s longest war.
527	David Muir	Senator Warren, you recently said quote, “We have one general after another in Afghanistan who comes in and says, ‘We’ve just turned the corner,’ and then what happens?
528	David Muir	It’s all the same.
529	David Muir	Someone new comes in and says, ‘We’ve just turned the corner.’ You said, “So many say it.
530	David Muir	We’re going in circles.”
531	David Muir	We were on the ground in Afghanistan and Iraq in recent months and the generals told us that the US needs some US presence on the ground, US special forces some presence to go after ISIS and the terrorists.
532	David Muir	If your commander-in-chief, would you listen to the generals or do they fall into the category of the generals you’ve mentioned before?
533	Elizabeth Warren	No.
534	Elizabeth Warren	Look, I sit on the Senate Armed Services Committee, so I get the briefings from the generals on a regular basis.
535	Elizabeth Warren	I’ve been to Afghanistan, to Iraq.
536	Elizabeth Warren	I’ve been to Jordan.
537	Elizabeth Warren	I’ve been throughout the region.
538	Elizabeth Warren	I’ve been there with John McCain.
539	Elizabeth Warren	I’ve been there with Lindsey Graham to ask the hard questions about what’s happening, to ask our generals, to ask their generals to ask people who are on the ground.
540	Elizabeth Warren	And the bottom line is, nobody sees a solution to this war.
541	Elizabeth Warren	Nobody can describe what winning looks like.
542	Elizabeth Warren	All they can describe is endless war.
543	Elizabeth Warren	And I realized there are people on this debate stage who are willing to say, yeah, we’ll leave our troops there for five more years, for 10 more years.
544	Elizabeth Warren	Lindsey Graham has said he’s willing to leave troops for 100 more years.
545	Elizabeth Warren	And yet, what has all these years of war brought us?
546	Elizabeth Warren	Right now, the Afghan Government controls less than 60% of the land.
547	Elizabeth Warren	People don’t have faith in it.
548	Elizabeth Warren	It’s a corrupt government.
549	Elizabeth Warren	The opium trade is higher than ever.
550	Elizabeth Warren	Look, we sent our troops in and they did their best.
551	Elizabeth Warren	They were there for us, but we need to be there for them.
552	Elizabeth Warren	And that means, not send our troops to do work that cannot be solved militarily.
553	Elizabeth Warren	It is time to bring our combat troops home.
554	Elizabeth Warren	It is time to stop this endless war in Afghanistan.
555	David Muir	Senator Warren, I want to press you on this.
556	David Muir	You just said, “combat troops.”
557	Elizabeth Warren	Yes.
558	David Muir	So if the generals came to you and said, we need US Special Forces, some footprint in Iraq and Afghanistan, would you listen?
559	David Muir	Would you leave them?
560	Elizabeth Warren	So I want to hear the plan, not just a, we need it now, we need it for the next day, we need it for the six months.
561	Elizabeth Warren	And I want to know where our allies are.
562	Elizabeth Warren	We all have an interest in dealing with terrorism and controlling terrorism, but that means it can’t just be the United States waging endless war.
563	Elizabeth Warren	That does not make us safer.
564	Elizabeth Warren	It does not make the region safer.
565	Elizabeth Warren	It does not make the world safer.
566	Elizabeth Warren	We should work with our allies in managing terrorism, but we need to end this war in Afghanistan.
567	Elizabeth Warren	We cannot wait five more years, or 10 more years, or until we turn the corner 10 more times.
568	Elizabeth Warren	We need to bring our combat troops home.
569	David Muir	Senator Warren, thank you.
570	David Muir	I want to take this to the Vice President because you have said of Senator Warren’s comments before that the United States should get out of the Middle East.
571	David Muir	You have said, “I quite frankly was surprised that I have never heard anyone say with any serious background in foreign policy that we should pull all troops out of the Middle East.” Is Senator Warren wrong on this?
572	Joe Biden	I’m not sure what she, if she wants to pull all troops out of the Middle East, but if she does want to put all troops out of the Middle East, we saw what happens when that happened.
573	Joe Biden	I helped put together a 61 nation group to take out ISIS by putting fewer than 5,000 forces along the Turkish border to see to it that they, and they lost 10,000, the Kurds, lost 10,000 lives.
574	Joe Biden	They defeated ISIS.
575	Joe Biden	They ended the caliphate and then the president on a whim dealing with a man I know very well, they’ve now, the guy running Turkey who is more of an autocrat now than a Democrat, and what happened?
576	Joe Biden	We pulled out and you saw what happened.
577	Joe Biden	You saw the end of the effort to be able to continue to contain, contain ISIS, number one.
578	Joe Biden	Number two, close your eye, everybody.
579	Joe Biden	Remember what you saw on television.
580	Joe Biden	You saw a woman standing up there holding up her baby, Kurd, saying, “Please don’t leave us.” And our military women and men standing at, going out in their [inaudible 00:53:49] Humvees with their heads down ashamed of what they did.
581	Joe Biden	It didn’t take a lot of men or men and women to do what needed to be done.
582	Joe Biden	And with regard Afghanistan, now I can say it because it was made public, I was totally against the whole notion of no nation building in Afghanistan.
583	Joe Biden	The only thing we should be doing is dealing with terrorism in that region.
584	Joe Biden	I’ve been in every part of Afghanistan, not in combat like my friend has, but in helicopter and/or on a vehicle in every part of it as senator and vice president.
585	Joe Biden	Here’s what I saw, there is no possibility of uniting that country, no possibility at all of making it a whole country.
586	Joe Biden	But it is possible to see to it that they’re not able to launch more attacks from the region on the United States of America.
587	Joe Biden	That’s a small footprint that we needed and I argued for that in the beginning.
588	David Muir	You mentioned Mayor Buttigieg.
589	David Muir	And I do want to take this to you next, mayor.
590	David Muir	Given your finish in Iowa, you’ve come under increasing scrutiny, attacks from opponents on experience.
591	David Muir	We’ve heard that theme even right here tonight.
592	David Muir	You have said on the Iraq War, for example.
593	David Muir	“I just don’t believe there is any justification for that vote.” You said, “It’s the difference between tenure and judgment.” That it’s the judgment that matters, not the time in Washington.
594	David Muir	Vice President Biden, as you know, voted yes.
595	David Muir	As commander-in-chief, do you believe your judgment would be better than the vice president’s?
596	Pete Buttigieg	I believe that I have the judgment to help us get through these situations where obviously the vice president made the wrong decision when it came to such an important moment in our foreign policy.
597	Pete Buttigieg	And looking forward, we got to recognize just how much is going to be on the plate of the next president that is different in kind from what we have faced before.
598	Pete Buttigieg	It’s not just about dealing with the aftermath of the war in Iraq, it’s about preventing a war with Iran.
599	Pete Buttigieg	And not only do we have to undertake the military and counter terrorism activities that we’ve been doing throughout, the next president is going to have to restore the credibility of this country among our allies and among the international community.
600	Pete Buttigieg	At a moment when we are facing fundamentally different challenges from asymmetric warfare to cybersecurity threats, in President Trump’s imagination of a national security strategy is a big wall and a moat full of alligators.
601	Pete Buttigieg	It’s a 17th century approach to keeping a place safe.
602	Pete Buttigieg	What we have to do is be ready for the future and that means insisting not only on shoring up our relationships, but defining a strategy to keep the American people safe from fundamentally new challenges.
603	David Muir	Mr. Vice President, I’ll let you respond to his argument on judgment.
604	Joe Biden	I made a mistake and I said it 14 years ago.
605	Joe Biden	I trusted George Bush to keep his word.
606	Joe Biden	He said he was not going to go into Iraq.
607	Joe Biden	He said he was only using this to unite the United Nations to insist we get inspectors in to see what Saddam was doing.
608	Joe Biden	When we got elected, the president turned to me with the entire security apparatus and said, “Joe, I want you to organize getting 156,000 troops out of Iraq.” I did that.
609	Joe Biden	I did that.
610	Joe Biden	The other thing I want to point out too is that NATO is in fact going to crumble if we don’t beat Trump.
611	Joe Biden	NATO is in real trouble.
612	Joe Biden	We need NATO for more reasons than just physical security.
613	Joe Biden	We need NATO to make sure that we do not allow Russia to continue to have its influence in Eastern Europe in ways that it had before.
614	Joe Biden	It wasn’t just to stop the Soviet Union from coming into the United States, coming into Europe.
615	Joe Biden	It was to make sure that we did not have a kleptocracy taking over that part of the world, to unite Europe in our behalf.
616	Joe Biden	I know how to deal with them.
617	Joe Biden	I know every one of these world leaders by their first names.
618	Joe Biden	They call me.
619	Joe Biden	I talked to them and I believe I can get it done.
620	David Muir	Mr. Vice President, thank you.
621	David Muir	Mr. Steyer, I do want to bring you in on this because I noticed in the last 24 hours you have an attack ad running here in New Hampshire with images of Mayor Buttigieg and you say over those images “an untested newcomer.” But I wanted to ask you tonight on this readiness to be commander-in-chief, you share the stage with a veteran from Afghanistan, a vice president who was in the Situation Room.
622	David Muir	What makes you most qualified of all candidates on this stage to be commander-in-chief?
623	Tom Steyer	Well, let me say this, I agree with Pete Buttigieg that it’s about judgment not tenure.
624	Tom Steyer	What we’re hearing here is a very long dissertation about exactly how America should be the world’s policemen.
625	Tom Steyer	And what we’ve actually seen in the Middle East is that Barack Obama used diplomacy to get Iran to give up its nuclear ambitions in return for our releasing economic sanctions along with our partners around the world.
626	Tom Steyer	So when we’re talking about our role in the world and commander-in-chief, we have abandoned a diplomacy.
627	Tom Steyer	We don’t have a strategy and we don’t have allies.
628	Tom Steyer	And actually this view of the world, that our response should be military is driven by our gigantic military complex and ignores the biggest problem that we face internationally in the world, which is climate change.
629	Tom Steyer	And it cannot be solved with guns and tanks and planes.
630	Tom Steyer	It can only be solved with diplomacy and allies and interaction with other countries.
631	Tom Steyer	So in fact, what we are listening to right here is a discussion of 20 years of failed military action and how we should continue it and how we should continue spending $700 billion dollars a year on defense when we spend $70 billion dollars a year at the federal level on education.
632	David Muir	Mr. Steyer [crosstalk 00:17:13].
633	Tom Steyer	Let’s talk about judgment here.
634	Tom Steyer	[crosstalk 00:59:16].
635	David Muir	Mr. Vice President, I’ll give you 30 seconds to respond.
636	Joe Biden	That’s not what I said, I was part of the reason putting that deal together with Iran.
637	Joe Biden	I was there.
638	Joe Biden	I was involved in that.
639	Joe Biden	I was also part of the deal putting together the Paris Climate Accord.
640	Joe Biden	I brought in the Chinese.
641	Joe Biden	I was part of that.
642	Joe Biden	I’ve been part of every major initiative we’ve had relative to diplomacy.
643	Joe Biden	I have not argued for the placement of major numbers of US combat troops.
644	Joe Biden	I have said, along with the President of the United States, Barack Obama as his partner, I have said, we have to strengthen NATO to make it clear that we keep our commitments when we make them.
645	Joe Biden	Like we don’t keep our commitments to the Kurds.
646	Joe Biden	We must keep our commitments when we make them.
647	Joe Biden	Otherwise, we have no power whatsoever.
648	Joe Biden	And it’s not about making sure we’re policeman of the world.
649	Joe Biden	The only way not to become the policeman of the world is to have allies who will join us in dealing with failed States and terrorism.
650	Joe Biden	And it has to be done jointly by a whole lot of people and it doesn’t require large number of US troops, and I’ve never said that.
651	Tom Steyer	Okay, can I respond to that, David?
652	David Muir	Senator Sanders, Senator Sanders, please.
653	Tom Steyer	Can I respond to [crosstalk 01:00:22].
654	Bernie Sanders	Let me say this if I might, like Joe and others, I also heard the arguments in terms of the war in Iraq from Bush, from Cheney, from John Bolton, from the whole administration.
655	Bernie Sanders	I listened very carefully and I concluded that they were lying through their teeth.
656	Bernie Sanders	And I not only voted against that war, but I help lead the opposition.
657	Bernie Sanders	And it saddens me so much.
658	Bernie Sanders	If you hear what I said, it’s on YouTube, my fears about all the destabilization that would take place by the US invading Iraq.
659	Bernie Sanders	It’s sad to me that, that is what happened.
660	Bernie Sanders	But let me just pick up on a point that Tom made, which is absolutely right.
661	Bernie Sanders	Trump wants to build a wall around America.
662	Bernie Sanders	The problem is if we are going to deal with issues like climate change, not only do we in America have to take on the greed of the fossil fuel industry, we have to lead the entire world.
663	Bernie Sanders	This is not an American issue.
664	Bernie Sanders	It’s a global issue.
665	Bernie Sanders	We got to bring China and Russia and Brazil and Pakistan and India and every major country on earth into the fight against climate change.
666	Bernie Sanders	And here is my dream, maybe it’s a radical dream, but maybe just may be given the crisis of climate change, the world can understand that instead of spending $1.8 trillion dollars a year collectively on weapons of destruction designed to kill each other, maybe we pool our resources and fight our common enemy, which is climate change.
667	David Muir	[crosstalk 00:20:02].
668	David Muir	Senator Sanders, thank you.
669	David Muir	George, back to you.
670	George S.	We have much more today coming up, but we have got to take a break.
671	George S.	We’ll be right back.
672	George S.	Welcome back of Saint Anselm College here in New Hampshire and we are here every four years, thanks to our amazing Manchester partner WMUR.
673	George S.	And now anchor Monica Hernandez and political director Adam Section are joining us with questions on the minds of New Hampshire voters.
674	Monica Hernandez	Thank you George.
675	Monica Hernandez	It’s an honor to be here in our community.
676	Monica Hernandez	We know Granite Staters are engaged and we know there are issues that strike especially close to home here.
677	Monica Hernandez	New Hampshire has one of the highest rates of deadly overdoses in the country.
678	Monica Hernandez	In some cases, police and paramedics tell us that they are saving the same lives again and again, sometimes more than once in a single day.
679	Monica Hernandez	It’s a healthcare issue, but it’s also so much more.
680	Monica Hernandez	Mayor Buttigieg, you have described yourself as a moderate, but one of your policies at least goes further than some on the stage with you are willing to go.
681	Monica Hernandez	You have called for the decriminalization of all drugs.
682	Monica Hernandez	Does that include heroin, meth, and cocaine, some of the drugs that have contributed to this crisis?
683	Pete Buttigieg	No.
684	Pete Buttigieg	What I’ve called for is that incarceration should no longer be the response to drug possession.
685	Monica Hernandez	With all due respect Mayor Buttigieg, on your website it says that you called for decriminalization of all drugs.
686	Pete Buttigieg	Again, what I’m calling for is that we end the use of incarceration as a response.
687	Pete Buttigieg	This does not mean that it will be lawful to produce or distribute those kinds of harmful drugs, but also as we know from the opioid crisis, some of this has been driven by companies that were acting irresponsibly with substances that were lawful.
688	Pete Buttigieg	It’s why in South Bend we sued those companies to hold them accountable.
689	Pete Buttigieg	We’ve got to make sure that there is accountability for those who suppressed evidence about the addictiveness of those substances.
690	Pete Buttigieg	Even while we’re also coming to recognize that these kinds of addiction are a medical issue, not a moral failure on the part of somebody battling that addiction.
691	Pete Buttigieg	That’s why medication assisted treatment is so important.
692	Pete Buttigieg	And those people who are being revived, and our own EMTs in my city had been so frustrated by the experience of reviving somebody, but then they have nowhere to go.
693	Pete Buttigieg	Sometimes you get brought back with a dose of Narcan, but then your life depends on whether in the days that follow you make it until somebody can actually see you, because we have such a shortage of mental health and addiction providers in this country.
694	Pete Buttigieg	We must act to change that and save lives when we do.
695	Monica Hernandez	I want to bring this question now to Mr. Yang.
696	Monica Hernandez	You’ve said you would decriminalize opioids, but you’ve also said that you would require all overdose patients to go to mandatory treatment centers for three days.
697	Monica Hernandez	Right now in New Hampshire there aren’t enough beds in treatment centers and across the country.
698	Monica Hernandez	How would you make sure treatment is available for all overdose patients and what would you do to fill the gap in the meantime?
699	Andrew Yang	That’s what we have to change, Monica.
700	Andrew Yang	I’ve heard heartbreaking stories from families here in New Hampshire that have been destroyed, torn apart by the opiod epidemic and you have to look at the companies that profited to the tune of tens of billions of dollars in profits of essentially blood money.
701	Andrew Yang	As President, we will take back those profits and put them to work right here in New Hampshire so that if you are seeking treatment, you have resources to be able to pursue it.
702	Andrew Yang	This is not a money problem fundamentally this is a human problem, but money cannot be the obstacle.
703	Andrew Yang	This is something that happened on the government’s watch.
704	Andrew Yang	The government allowed this opiod epidemic to spread throughout our communities and we have to do everything in our power to actually make sure that if you are seeking treatment, you know you’re not going to be sent to jail.
705	Andrew Yang	We have safe injection and safe consumption sites for you.
706	Andrew Yang	If you have a family member who’s struggling, you can refer them and know that they’re not going to have criminal penalties as a result.
707	Andrew Yang	There are so much about this that’s endemic to what’s happened throughout the country in terms of companies running amok, this hyper corporate capitalism where if money’s on one side in this country and people are on the other side, the money is winning.
708	Andrew Yang	You can see it with the opiate epidemic.
709	Andrew Yang	You can see it with the military industrial complex, the fossil fuel companies.
710	Andrew Yang	This is what must change and that’s where I’ll lead as president.
711	Monica Hernandez	Senator Klobuchar, I want to take the question to you now.
712	Monica Hernandez	As a prosecutor, you embrace tough on crime policies, even with drug offenders.
713	Monica Hernandez	You’ve also spoken many times about your father’s own addiction issues, his own alcoholism and his DUI arrests.
714	Monica Hernandez	If addiction is a disease, should people be arrested for it and as a prosecutor, do you regret sending people with substance abuse issues to jail?
715	Amy Klobuchar	I led one of the most successful drug courts in the country in Hennepin County, and I always would say and believed, and I think my record shows this, that we weren’t a business.
716	Amy Klobuchar	We didn’t want to see repeat customers.
717	Amy Klobuchar	And if you don’t want to see repeat customers, the only answer is treatment.
718	Amy Klobuchar	And maybe you’re referring to some of the people who were dealing big time in drugs.
719	Amy Klobuchar	Yes, I felt that we should prosecute those people, but when it comes to, when you asked Mr. Yang a question, and I think it, we owe it to the people of New Hampshire, had one of the biggest addiction rates in the countries and death rates when it comes to opioids, to explain how we will pay for the treatment and the bed.
720	Amy Klobuchar	I’ve been very clear about this.
721	Amy Klobuchar	There’s going to be a major settlement coming through, a federal settlement against all these opioid manufacturers.
722	Amy Klobuchar	The evidence is overwhelming, including an email where one guy, a business guy, says to the other, “They’re eating them like Doritos.
723	Amy Klobuchar	Just keep pumping them out.” We will get a conservative estimate, $40 billion in from that settlement, we can put a 2 cents per milligram tax on opiods that brings in another 40 billion.
724	Amy Klobuchar	Then you can close a hedge fund loophole that brings in $18 billion.
725	Amy Klobuchar	And just like every other policy I’ve proposed, and I think New Hampshire voters should care about this, I have showed how I’m going to pay for it.
726	Amy Klobuchar	Because I think we have someone in the White House that has told over 15,000 lies.
727	Amy Klobuchar	He makes all kinds of promises.
728	Amy Klobuchar	The people of New Hampshire and the people of our country deserve better.
729	Amy Klobuchar	I will get this done and it is personal for me.
730	Adam Sexton	Good evening candidates.
731	Adam Sexton	New Hampshire is a battleground, not just for presidential contenders but also for top issues and that includes gun policy.
732	Adam Sexton	Senator Sanders, for many voters in this Democratic primary, your allure is about consistency when it comes to progressive issues you’ve been on the right side of them for a long time.
733	Adam Sexton	One exception is gun rights.
734	Adam Sexton	In the ’90s when you were in Congress, you voted against background checks.
735	Adam Sexton	You also voted against a waiting period for purchase of a firearm.
736	Adam Sexton	Can you explain why you opposed these things that you now support?
737	Bernie Sanders	I can Adam, and let me also say that in 1988 I probably lost a race for Congress, and we only have one Congress person in the whole state, because in 1988 I said that we should ban the sale and distribution of assault weapons in this country.
738	Bernie Sanders	That was 30 years ago.
739	Bernie Sanders	Furthermore, I am very proud that today I have a D- voting record from the NRA.
740	Bernie Sanders	And under my administration it will be the American people doing gun policy, not dictated by the NRA.
741	Bernie Sanders	But to answer your question, I come, like New Hampshire, from a very, very rural state.
742	Bernie Sanders	In Vermont until the last two years ago, we had virtually no gun control legislation at all and I represented that perspective.
743	Bernie Sanders	The world has changed.
744	Bernie Sanders	In Vermont and in New Hampshire and all over this country, people are sickened by the mass shootings that we have seen and the gun violence that we have seen.
745	Bernie Sanders	The world has changed and my views have changed, and my view is right now we need universal background checks, we end the gun show loophole, we end the so called straw man provision.
746	Bernie Sanders	We make certain that we end the sale and distribution of assault weapons in this country, and we go further.
747	Bernie Sanders	We go further, but at the bottom line is I will not be intimidated by the NRA.
748	Bernie Sanders	We’re going to run the gun policy that the American people want.
749	Adam Sexton	Vice President Biden, you’ve taken a lot of heat in this primary, on these debate stages and from voters here in New Hampshire for your past positions.
750	Adam Sexton	You’ve essentially asked them to look at the totality of your record and give you the benefit of the doubt.
751	Adam Sexton	Does Senator Sanders deserve that same benefit of the doubt on guns?
752	Joe Biden 	Here’s the deal.
753	Joe Biden 	The biggest mistake that Bernie made, that Senator Sanders made, he voted to give the gun manufacturers, the only major industry in America, a loophole that does not allow them to be sued for the carnage they are creating.
754	Joe Biden 	First thing I’ll do as President is work to get rid of that.
755	Joe Biden 	It’s going to be hard.
756	Joe Biden 	Think of all the thousands and thousands of people who died.
757	Joe Biden 	And I might add Bernie, while you were representing your constituency, an awful lot of people [inaudible 00:13:18] your gun state and they’ve come around.
758	Joe Biden 	In fact, all those folks in California, New York, Pennsylvania, they’re getting killed by the thousands during the same period.
759	Joe Biden 	I come from a state that’s a major gun owning stare.
760	Joe Biden 	I introduced the first assault weapons ban.
761	Joe Biden 	I in fact got it passed.
762	Joe Biden 	I’m the only guy that beat the NRA twice.
763	Joe Biden 	While I was pushing the Brady Background Bill to check background checks, Bernie voted five times against that when he was in the House.
764	Joe Biden 	So look, the other thing is that we have to be held accountable for the things we did, I’m the guy that set up drug courts.
765	Joe Biden 	I set them up.
766	Joe Biden 	I wrote it into law and it never got funded.
767	Joe Biden 	And also on opioids, I’m the guy who’s already begun to make a down payment.
768	Joe Biden 	In the Cures Act I put in $1 billion to fight opioid addiction.
769	Joe Biden 	And lastly, my time is going to be up, surely.
770	Joe Biden 	Here’s the deal.
771	Joe Biden 	Those Chief Executive Officer of drug companies, they should not only be fined, they should go to jail.
772	Adam Sexton	Senator Warren, we’d like to go over to you now.
773	Adam Sexton	[inaudible 00:14:18] I want to ask you this question here though.
774	Adam Sexton	Laws can do so much, if you could change one thing about America’s gun culture, what would it be?
775	Elizabeth Warren	Look, we have a gun violence problem in America.
776	Elizabeth Warren	It is about the mass shootings that we hear about in our schools and that frighten us, about it in theaters and in churches.
777	Elizabeth Warren	It’s also though about shootings that occur on sidewalks and in playgrounds, often in communities of color that are hit hardest, but there are no headlines over those.
778	Elizabeth Warren	It’s also about suicide and the increasing lethality of suicide because of the availability of guns.
779	Elizabeth Warren	It is also about the increased chances that it’s usually a woman will die of domestic violence if she is with a violent man and a gun is in the home.
780	Elizabeth Warren	We need to think of this problem not as one and done or three things and done.
781	Elizabeth Warren	We need to think of it just like we did on auto safety.
782	Elizabeth Warren	We just keep coming back.
783	Elizabeth Warren	We treat it like the public health emergency that it is.
784	Elizabeth Warren	But the question we should be asking ourselves is when America, across this country, including gun owners, agree in certain basic things, universal background checks, get assault weapons off the streets.
785	Elizabeth Warren	Why can we not even get a vote in the United States Senate?
786	Elizabeth Warren	And the answer is 90%, think about this, more than 90% of Americans agree on this.
787	Elizabeth Warren	We can’t get a vote in the United States Senate because it is the gun industry that continues to call the shots.
788	Elizabeth Warren	Until we attack the corruption in Washington, the influence of money on campaigns and lobbying, we’re not going to be able to meet our promises.
789	Elizabeth Warren	And one more, until we agree that we are willing to roll back to filibuster, the gun industry is going to continue to have a veto and we will never make the changes we make.
790	Elizabeth Warren	We have to be willing to build a future that works, not for a gun industry, but that works for the rest of America and protects our children.
791	Joe Biden 	We ought to be able to sue the gun industry.
792	David Muir	Thank you, candidates.
793	David Muir	We’re going to go back to David up there [inaudible 00:16:26].
794	David Muir	Adam and Monica, thank you and thanks to WMUR tonight.
795	David Muir	I want to turn to the Supreme Court, the balance on the court and the issues before the court right now.
796	David Muir	President Trump in just the last 24 hours saying we’ve appointed 191 federal judges, two Supreme Court Justices, keeping his campaign promise to shift the Court to the right with Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.
797	David Muir	The Affordable Care Act is at the court.
798	David Muir	Climate change is working its way to the court, and a major abortion case is on the docket this year.
799	David Muir	Vice President Biden, on the issue of abortion, in 2012 you said, “President Obama’s two Supreme Court picks of them, there was no litmus test.
800	David Muir	We picked people who had an open mind, did not come with an agenda.” And you’ve said before, “We both believed that we should not apply narrow litmus tests to appointees to the Supreme Court.” Let me just ask, would you do it differently as President, Mr. Vice President?
801	David Muir	Would there be a litmus test on abortion?
802	Joe Biden 	If you say the rest of what I said.
803	Joe Biden 	I said that we’re going to not appoint anyone who did not have a view that unenumerated rights existed in the Constitution.
804	Joe Biden 	That’s not a specific test.
805	Joe Biden 	It’s a generic test.
806	Joe Biden 	And only way, the only reason women have the right to choose is because it’s determined that there’s unenumerated rights coming from the Ninth Amendment in the Constitution.
807	Joe Biden 	That’s what I said.
808	Joe Biden 	And I was part of the reason why Elena Kagan, who worked for me, we got onto the Supreme Court.
809	Joe Biden 	I was part of the reason why Ruth Bader Ginsburg is on the Court.
810	Joe Biden 	I was part of the reason why Sotomayer is on the Court and she will swear me in.
811	Joe Biden 	I presided, and I’m the reason why this right wasn’t taken away a long time ago because I almost single handedly made sure that Robert Bork did not get on the Court because he did not think there should be enumerated rights [inaudible 00:18:04].
812	David Muir	So let me just-
813	Joe Biden 	Let’s get that straight.
814	David Muir	Mr. Vice President, I am aware of what you said, which is why I’m asking would you do it differently now?
815	David Muir	Would there be a litmus test on abortion?
816	Joe Biden 	Yes.
817	Joe Biden 	Look, here’s the deal.
818	Joe Biden 	Litmus test on abortion relates to the fundamental value of the Constitution.
819	Joe Biden 	A woman does have a right to choose.
820	Joe Biden 	I would in fact, if they rule it to be unconstitutional, I will send to the United States Congress and it will pass, I believe, a bill that… Excuse me, legislates Roe V. Wade adjusted by Casey.
821	Joe Biden 	It’s a woman’s right to do that.
822	Joe Biden 	Period.
823	Joe Biden 	And if you call that a litmus test it’s a litmus test, but what I was talking about in the past, so no one gets confused here, is if there is no… If you read the Constitution very, very narrowly and say there are no unenumerated rights.
824	Joe Biden 	If the doesn’t say it in the Constitution that doesn’t exist, you cannot have any of the things I care about, any of the things I care about as a progressive member of the United States Congress at the time, and as Vice President and as a member of society.
825	David Muir	Mr. Vice president, thank you.
826	David Muir	Senator Warren.
827	Elizabeth Warren	Look, I’ve lived in an America in which abortion was illegal and rich women still got abortions and that’s what we have to remember about this.
828	Elizabeth Warren	States are heading toward trying to ban abortion outright and the Supreme Court seems headed in exactly that direction as well.
829	Elizabeth Warren	If we are going to protect the people of the United States of America and we are going to protect our rights to have dominion over our own bodies, then it’s going to mean we can’t simply rely on the courts.
830	Elizabeth Warren	Three out of every four people in America believe right now that the rule of Roe versus Wade should be the law.
831	Elizabeth Warren	That means we should be pushing for a Congressional solution as well.
832	Elizabeth Warren	It is time to have a national law to protect the right of a woman’s choice.
833	David Muir	Senator Warren, thank you.
834	David Muir	Senator Klobuchar, I do want to come to you.
835	David Muir	Should there be a litmus test?
836	David Muir	It’s an active hall here tonight.
837	David Muir	I did want to come to you on this question.
838	Amy Klobuchar	Thank you.
839	David Muir	Should there be a litmus test on abortion?
840	Amy Klobuchar	I would only appoint judges that would respect precedent and one of those key precedents is Roe v. Wade.
841	Amy Klobuchar	In addition, you have got to put it into law.
842	Amy Klobuchar	Donald Trump, and I think it’s really important to take it to him here, when he was running for election, and this is a case I will make on the debate stage against him, he actually said that he wanted to put women in jail.
843	Amy Klobuchar	He then dialed it back and said, “No, I want to put doctors in jail.” Is it a big surprise then we’re seeing states like Alabama start enacting laws that would criminalize doctors who perform abortions.
844	Amy Klobuchar	It’s not.
845	Amy Klobuchar	And that is why it’s going to be really important when you look at the overwhelming public support for funding Planned Parenthood, for making sure women have access to contraception, to making sure that they have a right to choose, that we make this case strongly and loudly.
846	David Muir	Senator Klobuchar, thank you.
847	David Muir	Mayor Buttigieg, you have signaled that you’d be open to the idea of expanding the Court.
848	David Muir	Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg suggested leaving the Court as it is, saying quote, “Nine seems to be a good number.” And in fact she said if the number of justices is increased quote, “It would make the Court appear partisan.
849	David Muir	It would be one side saying, ‘When we’re in power, we’re going to enlarge the number of judges to have more people who will vote the way we want them to.
850	David Muir	'” Is Justice Ginsburg wrong?
851	Pete Buttigieg	Well, if all we did was change the number of justices than I agree with her that that could be the consequence.
852	Pete Buttigieg	What I’ve called for is not only reforming the number of justices on the bench, but structural reform so that some of the justices are not appointed through a partisan process.
853	Pete Buttigieg	We cannot allow the Supreme Court to continue to become one more political battlefield as we are seeing today.
854	Pete Buttigieg	And the time has come for us to think bigger, not just reforming the makeup of the court as America, by the way, has done several times in our history.
855	Pete Buttigieg	But also remember that the founders gave us the power to amend the Constitution for a reason and we shouldn’t be afraid to use it.
856	Pete Buttigieg	It’s not something you do lightly or quickly, but when it comes to something like Citizens United, which holds that corporations have the same political soul as people and that spending money to influence an election is the same thing as writing an op-ed to your local paper, we need a Constitutional amendment to clear that up and protect our democracy.
857	David Muir	Mayor Buttigieg, thank you.
858	David Muir	Vice President Biden, I do want to come to you on this.
859	David Muir	President Trump has said that the only reason Democrats want to expand the Court is they want to try and catch up.
860	David Muir	You have called any expansion of the court a bad idea, adding, “We will live to rue that day.” Do you agree with President Trump on-
861	Joe Biden 	I agree with Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
862	Joe Biden 	That’s who I agree with.
863	Joe Biden 	And I agree the way you deal with Citizens United is pass a constitutional amendment I introduced 25 years ago saying that only public money can be spent in elections.
864	Joe Biden 	Period.
865	Joe Biden 	Not private money, not billionaires, not money from special interests.
866	Joe Biden 	Period.
867	Joe Biden 	That’s the way to amend the Constitution to deal with that.
868	Joe Biden 	In addition to that, if in fact… Look, the Democrats stood up against the man I’ve revered, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, he wanted to expand the Court.
869	Joe Biden 	But they were wise enough to understand that whoever then has the majority will have the ability to abuse it and it will lose its legitimacy and there are three equal branches of government.
870	Joe Biden 	It says the President shell nominate, the Senate shall dispose, the Senate shall make that decision, not the president.
871	Joe Biden 	He can nominate.
872	Joe Biden 	That’s why it’s so important we must win back the United States Senate this time out.
873	Joe Biden 	And that’s why as you all look at it up here in New Hampshire and around the world, excuse me, around the country, you have to ask yourself, who is most likely to help get a Senator elected in North Carolina, Georgia?
874	Joe Biden 	Who can win Florida, Pennsylvania, Minnesota?
875	Joe Biden 	Who can do that?
876	Joe Biden 	Because you got to be able to win those… Well, you can.
877	Joe Biden 	I agree.
878	Joe Biden 	But here’s the point.
879	Joe Biden 	You’ve got to be able to, you’ve got to be able to not just win, you’ve got to bring along a United States Senate or this becomes moot.
880	David Muir	Senator Sanders [crosstalk 00:24:17].
881	Bernie Sanders	Look, you asked the simple question, is there a litmus test for those of us up here?
882	Bernie Sanders	For me there is.
883	Bernie Sanders	I will never nominate any person to the Supreme Court or the federal courts in general who was not 100% pro Roe v. Wade.
884	Bernie Sanders	Number two, we have got a codify Roe v. Wade into legislation.
885	Bernie Sanders	Number three, we have to significantly expand funding for Planned Parenthood.
886	David Muir	Mr. Steyer, I want to bring you in on this because you have claimed that when it comes to the Supreme Court, you have said Republicans have been cheating.
887	Tom Steyer	Sure they’ve been cheating.
888	Tom Steyer	Look, what we saw Mitch McConnell do, not just in the Supreme Court with Merrick Garland, but across the board with federal judges, was refuse to allow President Obama’s picks to be considered.
889	Tom Steyer	That’s why Mr. Trump has appointed so many federal judges, because in fact the Republicans refused to allow President Obama to get his due, and honestly, we’re sitting here talking about do you have a litmus test?
890	Tom Steyer	We all have the litmus test.
891	Tom Steyer	Everybody on this row feels exactly the same way about a woman’s right to choose.
892	Tom Steyer	Everybody on this row feels exactly the same way on gun control.
893	Tom Steyer	Every single one in this row feels the same way.
894	Tom Steyer	There’s something else going on.
895	Tom Steyer	These Republicans are in control.
896	Tom Steyer	They’re stacking the Court for a generation with young right-wing radicals, and we’ve watched it happen and the question is what are we going to do about it?
897	Tom Steyer	That’s where we are in the United States, and the question is… Actually Joe Biden’s right.
898	Tom Steyer	We have to go win a huge victory this year, and we’re in trouble.
899	Tom Steyer	And so the question is going to be, look at these people, who can pull together the Democratic Party?
900	Tom Steyer	And let me say this, we have not said one word tonight about race.
901	Tom Steyer	Not one word.
902	Tom Steyer	Are you kidding me?
903	Tom Steyer	We have the most diverse party.
904	Tom Steyer	We have a very diverse country.
905	Tom Steyer	We have a very diverse party.
906	Tom Steyer	The heart and soul of this party is diversity, black people, Latinos, AAPI people, Native Americans and white people.
907	Tom Steyer	But for goodness sakes, pull it together.
908	Tom Steyer	We’re talking about something different.
909	Tom Steyer	The question we have is how are we getting that diverse group of people to the polls?
910	Tom Steyer	What are we saying?
911	Tom Steyer	Everybody on this stage feels the same way about a woman’s right to choose and economic justice.
912	Tom Steyer	The question is how do we beat Trump?
913	Tom Steyer	How do we take down these Republicans?
914	Tom Steyer	And the answer is we’ve got to show we can take them down on growth, job creation, the economy.
915	Tom Steyer	We send them packing and then we get all of this including beating the corporations.
916	David Muir	Mr Steyer, thank you.
917	David Muir	The night is still young.
918	David Muir	Many questions to come, and Linsey Davis is next.
919	Linsey Davis	I want to turn now to criminal justice.
920	Linsey Davis	Mayor Buttigieg…
921	David Muir	Linsey Davis is next.
922	Linsey Davis	I want to turn now to criminal justice.
923	Linsey Davis	Mayor Buttigieg, under your leadership as mayor, a black resident in South Bend, Indiana was four times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than a white resident.
924	Linsey Davis	Now, that racial disparity is higher than the rest of the state, in fact, it’s higher than the rest of the nation, and that disparity increased in South Bend after you took office.
925	Linsey Davis	When talking about the problem on national terms, you’ve called it “evidence of systemic racism.” You were mayor for eight years, so weren’t you, in effect, the head of the system, and how do explain that increase in black arrests under your leadership?
926	Pete Buttigieg	Well, the reality is, on my watch, drug arrests in South Bend were lower than the national average, and specifically to marijuana, lower than in Indiana.
927	Pete Buttigieg	But there is no question that systemic racism has penetrated to every level of our system, and my city was not immune.
928	Pete Buttigieg	I took a lot of heat for discussing systemic racism with my own police department, but we’ve got to confront the fact that there is no escaping how this is part of all of our policies.
929	Pete Buttigieg	Earlier, we were talking about opioids, and thankfully, America has come to a better understanding about the fact that opioid addiction is best understood as a medical problem.
930	Pete Buttigieg	But there were a lot of people, including a lot of African American activists in my community who have made the very good point, it’s great that everybody’s so enlightened about drug policy now when it comes to opioids, but where were you when it came to marijuana, where were you when it came to the crack epidemic in the 1990s?
931	Pete Buttigieg	That is one of the reasons why I am calling for us as a country to take up those reforms that end incarceration as a response to possession and make sure that we legalize marijuana and when we do it, do it retroactively with expungements to correct the harm done in so many cases of incarceration, disproportionately of black and brown Americans where the incarceration did far more harm than the offense it was intended to deal with.
932	Linsey Davis	Right, let me go back to the original question though.
933	Linsey Davis	How do you explain the increase in black arrests in South Bend under your leadership for marijuana possession?
934	Pete Buttigieg	And again, the overall rate was lower than the national rate.
935	Linsey Davis	No, there was an increase.
936	Linsey Davis	The year before you were in office, it was lower.
937	Linsey Davis	Once you became in office in 2012, that number went up.
938	Linsey Davis	In 2018, the last number year that we have record for, that number was still up.
939	Pete Buttigieg	And one of the strategies that our community adopted was to target, when there were cases where there was gun violence and gang violence, which was slaughtering so many in our community, burying teenagers, disproportionately black teenagers, we adopted a strategy that said that drug enforcement would be targeted in cases where there was a connection to the most violent group or gang connected to a murder.
940	Pete Buttigieg	These things are all connected, but that’s the point.
941	Pete Buttigieg	So are all of the things that need to change in order for us to prevent violence and remove the effects of systemic racism, not just from criminal justice, but from our economy, from health, from housing, and from our democracy itself.
942	Linsey Davis	Senator Warren, is that a substantial answer from Mayor Buttigieg?
943	Elizabeth Warren	No.
944	Elizabeth Warren	You have to own up to the fact, and it’s important to own up to the facts about how race has totally permeated our criminal justice system.
945	Elizabeth Warren	For the exact same crimes, study after study now shows that African Americans are more likely than whites to be detained, to be arrested, to be taken to trial, to be wrongfully convicted, and receive harsher sentences.
946	Elizabeth Warren	We need to rework our criminal justice system, from the very front end on what we make illegal all the way through the system, and how we help people come back into the community.
947	Elizabeth Warren	But we cannot just say that criminal justice is the only time we want to talk about race specifically.
948	Elizabeth Warren	We need to start having race-conscious laws.
949	Elizabeth Warren	Housing, for example, I have a great housing plan to build more housing in America, but understand it was the policy of the United States of America to discriminate against African Americans and any other people of color for buying homes until 1965.
950	Elizabeth Warren	You can’t just repeal that and say “Okay, now everything is even.” It’s not.
951	Elizabeth Warren	We need race-conscious laws in education and employment, in entrepreneurship, to make this country a country of opportunity for everyone, no matter the color of their skin.
952	Andrew Yang	Elizabeth, with respect, you can’t regulate away racism with a whole patchwork of laws that are race-specific.
953	Andrew Yang	What we have to do is heed the writings of Martin Luther King, whose birthday we just celebrated.
954	Andrew Yang	He said that capitalism forgets that life is social, and what he was championing was a guaranteed minimum income for all Americans of $1000 a month or more that would end up reshaping our economy in communities of color, make it so that black net work is not 10% of white net worth in this country, which is the most important number of them all.
955	Andrew Yang	We can’t regulate that away through any other means except by putting money directly into the hands of African Americans and Latinos and people of color to allow businesses to actually flourish and grow in those communities.
956	Andrew Yang	The only way that will happen is if black and Latino consumers have buying power, and that is where we have to move as a country.
957	Linsey Davis	Senator Sanders, then Mr. Steyer.
958	Tom Steyer	Let me say this, I disagree.
959	Tom Steyer	Andrew, no, let me say this.
960	Tom Steyer	I disagree with you Andrew.
961	Tom Steyer	I am the person on this stage who will say openly, I’m for reparations.
962	Tom Steyer	Something wrong happened.
963	Tom Steyer	I am for reparations to African Americans in this country, and anyone who things that racism is a thing of the past and not an ongoing problem is not dealing with reality.
964	Tom Steyer	In fact, three days ago, one of the leaders of Joe Biden’s South Carolina campaign made racist remarks about someone associated with our campaign, and the Legislative Black Caucus went out en masse to stand up for that man and for our campaign.
965	Tom Steyer	Joe, I’m asking you to come with me and the Legislative Black Caucus and disavow Dick Harpootlian and what he had to say.
966	Tom Steyer	It was wrong, and I’m asking you to join us.
967	Tom Steyer	Be on the right side.
968	Joe Biden 	I’m asking you to join me and join in the support I have from the overwhelming number of the members of that Black Caucus.
969	Joe Biden 	I have more support in South Carolina in the Black Caucus and the black community than anybody else.
970	Joe Biden 	Double what you have, or anybody else here.
971	Bernie Sanders	I don’t think that’s quite right.
972	Tom Steyer	But wait a second, wait a second.
973	Tom Steyer	Bernie.
974	Joe Biden 	Well, that is quite right.
975	Tom Steyer	Let’s not argue about polls.
976	Tom Steyer	Bernie, this isn’t about polls.
977	Linsey Davis	Senator Sanders …
978	Joe Biden 	This is not about polls.
979	Joe Biden 	I’m not talking about polls.
980	Bernie Sanders	Let me just say, first of all, we have nine members of the Black Caucus in South Carolina supporting us, but more importantly, much of what Elizabeth said is absolutely correct.
981	Bernie Sanders	We have a racist society from top to bottom impacting healthcare, housing, criminal justice, education, you name it.
982	Bernie Sanders	And clearly this is an issue that must be dealt with.
983	Bernie Sanders	But in terms of criminal justice, what we have got to do is understand the system is broken, is racist.
984	Bernie Sanders	We invested our young people in jobs and education, not more jails and incarceration.
985	Bernie Sanders	We end the war on drugs, which has disproportionately impacted African Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans.
986	Bernie Sanders	We end private prisons and detention centers in America.
987	Tom Steyer	Bernie, I appreciate what you’re saying.
988	Bernie Sanders	And, excuse me, we also, most people don’t know this.
989	Bernie Sanders	Tonight in America, 200,000 people are in jail without having been convicted of anything.
990	Tom Steyer	That’s right.
991	Bernie Sanders	200,000 people, because they can’t afford the $500 for bail they need to get out of jail.
992	Bernie Sanders	That is outrageous, we’re going to end cash bail in America.
993	Tom Steyer	Okay, let me say this.
994	Tom Steyer	I’ve worked, Bernie, I’ve worked to end cash bail in California and it’s gone.
995	Tom Steyer	I’ve worked to end private prisons in California and they’re gone.
996	Tom Steyer	I’m somebody who’s, our family, my wife and I started a bank specifically to support businesses owned by women, black people, and Latinos, because they couldn’t get financing anywhere else.
997	Tom Steyer	But I, Joe, I want a answer.
998	Tom Steyer	Really.
999	Tom Steyer	I think you should come over and disavow the statements that this man made that were openly racist, that were wrong, and the Legislative Black Caucus is against.
1000	Tom Steyer	I’m asking you to join us and do the right thing.
1001	Joe Biden 	I’ve already spoken to Dick Harpootlian and he in fact is, I believe, sorry for what he said.
1002	Joe Biden 	But here’s the deal, folks.
1003	Joe Biden 	We’ve got to stop taking the black community for granted.
1004	Joe Biden 	That’s the starting place.
1005	Joe Biden 	Every one of the things we talked about here, for example, in South Carolina, Jim Clyburn, he has a program, 10-15-30.
1006	Joe Biden 	We should be investing our money in those communities that haven’t gotten help for a long time and give most of that help to those communities.
1007	Joe Biden 	Make it a priority.
1008	Joe Biden 	We should make sure that we have no one going to jail for a drug offense, they go directly, mandatory prison.
1009	Joe Biden 	I mean, excuse me, mandatory treatment, not prison.
1010	Joe Biden 	And we fund it.
1011	Joe Biden 	And we fund it, and three days doesn’t get it.
1012	Joe Biden 	It takes at least 60 to 90 days to make any progress.
1013	Joe Biden 	We have to pay for that.
1014	Joe Biden 	Just like instead of building new prisons, we build new rehabilitation centers.
1015	Joe Biden 	We have to make sure that we have a window at the Treasury Department that allows entrepreneurs who are black and brown and minorities to be able to get loans to be able to start businesses.
1016	Joe Biden 	You know, if you own a house, I know you do know, if you own a house in an all black neighborhood, same exact house in all white neighborhood, exact same shape, the house valued in the black neighborhood would be valued as worth less, making it difficult for you to accumulate wealth, as my friend at the end of the line here says.
1017	Joe Biden 	So here’s the deal: we have to do much, much more.
1018	Joe Biden 	That’s what got me involved in politics in the first place, redlining, to stop it.
1019	Joe Biden 	I got involved through the Civil Rights Movement, I became a public defender.
1020	Joe Biden 	That’s why I got involved.
1021	Joe Biden 	There’s so many things we have to do across the board, and in education, at-risk schools.
1022	Joe Biden 	We should triple the funding we have for at-risk schools to provide for three, four, and five years old to go to school, not daycare.
1023	Joe Biden 	Increase the salaries of teachers, encourage more blacks to get into teaching, especially black men, because studies show when there’s a black man in a school, it increases prospects significantly, and so on.
1024	Joe Biden 	There’s a lot we can do, I’ve laid it all out as how to do, go to joebiden.com, you’ll see the whole deal, including criminal justice reform.
1025	Linsey Davis	Thank you Mr. Vice President.
1026	Linsey Davis	As you mentioned South Carolina, three weeks from tomorrow they’ll go to the polls to vote, black voters make up about 60% of the electorate there.
1027	Linsey Davis	Senator Sanders, several weeks ago, Nina Turner, one of your national co-chairs, published an op-ed piece that said Vice President Biden has “repeatedly betrayed black voters to side with Republican lawmakers and undermine our progress.” Senator Sanders, do you agree with her, one of your most visible surrogates, that Vice President Biden has repeatedly betrayed black voters?
1028	Bernie Sanders	Well, I think what Senator Turner was talking about are some of the early actions of Vice President Biden, but no.
1029	Bernie Sanders	Joe Biden is a friend of mine, and I’m not here to attack him.
1030	Bernie Sanders	But what I would say is that what we need in terms of the African American community is to understand that we have got to start investing big time in education, in healthcare.
1031	Bernie Sanders	There is no excuse why white families in America have 10 times more wealth than black families.
1032	Bernie Sanders	No excuse that disproportionately, African Americans are in jail compared to whites.
1033	Bernie Sanders	No excuse for black women dying in childbirth three times the rate that white women are doing as well.
1034	Linsey Davis	Senator Klobuchar?
1035	Amy Klobuchar	Yes.
1036	Linsey Davis	You had raised your hand before.
1037	Amy Klobuchar	Yes I did, because I think in addition to the economic argument we’re making here with the sad, sad stories of a woman walking into a maternity room in New Orleans and saying her hand are swollen and walking out without her baby, and 30% of African American kids being living in poverty, we know that there are economic solutions here, to invest in those communities, housing, childcare.
1038	Amy Klobuchar	But there’s something else insidious going on that we haven’t addressed, and that is the systematic racism when it comes to voting.
1039	Amy Klobuchar	That is, moves across the country to limit people’s right to vote, and that is why I have been leading on these bills to automatically register every kid to vote in this country when they turn 18.
1040	Amy Klobuchar	There is no reason that we can’t do that across this country.
1041	Amy Klobuchar	To stop the gerrymandering by setting up independent commissions in every single state, and yes, to stop the voting purges.
1042	Amy Klobuchar	Because what is going on right now in the words of one North Carolina court is that they are discriminating with surgical precision against African American voters, and we are not going to be able to get any of these things done if we don’t give people the right to vote.
1043	Linsey Davis	Vice President Biden and then Senator Warren.
1044	Joe Biden 	I beg your pardon?
1045	Linsey Davis	I just wanted to give you a chance to respond.
1046	Joe Biden 	Yes, I agree completely.
1047	Joe Biden 	There should be registration, automatic registration, turning 18, you get a driver’s license, whatever you do, you automatically are registered, number one.
1048	Joe Biden 	Number two, with regard to what we’re going to see in South Carolina, we’re all going to be there pretty soon.
1049	Joe Biden 	We’ll see whether or not it works.
1050	Joe Biden 	In response to the letter that the person, I’m not saying Bernie wrote the letter, but the senator who wrote the letter was very brisk and significant with other African Americans in South Carolina taking issue with her.
1051	Joe Biden 	But look, Amy is right, the senator’s correct.
1052	Joe Biden 	That is that we, in fact, there is systematic racism, and that’s why our Justice Department works so hard to go after those.
1053	Joe Biden 	You know, realize there are 35 states in the United States of America that have come up with a total of 78 laws to restrict voting just in the last five years to try to keep African Americans from voting, and brown as well, black and brown people from voting.
1054	Joe Biden 	And that will be an enormous priority in my administration as it was in ours.
1055	Joe Biden 	It’s just wrong, simply wrong.
1056	Elizabeth Warren	I’m glad to stand on this stage with my fellow Democrats who talk about how important the black community is, at least at election time.
1057	Elizabeth Warren	Year after year after year, election after election after election, Democrats go to people in the black community and say “Boy, we really care about these issues.
1058	Elizabeth Warren	Racism is terrible, we all want to do something,” and then somehow the problem just seems to keep getting worse.
1059	Elizabeth Warren	Well I think it’s time we have real, concrete plans that are going to make a difference in people’s lives.
1060	Elizabeth Warren	I proposed a two cent wealth tax.
1061	Elizabeth Warren	And let me tell you just one of the things we can do with a two cent wealth tax.
1062	Elizabeth Warren	We can cancel student loan debt for 43 million Americans, and because African Americans have to borrow more money to go to college, borrow more money while they’re in college and have a harder time paying it back when they get out, that one law is going to help close the black-white wealth gap for people with student loans by about 20 points.
1063	Elizabeth Warren	We aren’t making a difference in America.
1064	Elizabeth Warren	We’re saying to the rich folks “You keep your money, and the rest of us will talk about racism but not really do anything.” I think the time for that is over, I’m ready to get in this fight and really make a change.
1065	Joe Biden 	Okay, thank you.
1066	George S.	Actually, let’s keep this debate going.
1067	George S.	Go ahead, Mr. Steyer.
1068	Tom Steyer	Out of narrative comes policy.
1069	Tom Steyer	And we’re talking about a lot of policies that affect Americans, broadly and disproportionately affect black Americans or brown Americans.
1070	Tom Steyer	But what I believe is we should set up a commission on race and deal with race explicitly.
1071	Tom Steyer	Because everyone’s saying we can’t have rules that are different for different people, but in fact we’re here because we had rules that are different for different people.
1072	Tom Steyer	I would set up a formal commission on race on day one to retell the story of the last 400 years in America of systematic racism against African Americans, not just legal discrimination, injustice, and cruelty, but also the contribution that the African American community has made to America in building it and in leading the entire country from a moral standpoint for generations and centuries.
1073	Tom Steyer	Because I believe out of narrative comes policy.
1074	Tom Steyer	We need to repair damage that’s been done officially, and pretending we’re all the same is not accurate.
1075	Tom Steyer	We got here a certain way.
1076	Tom Steyer	Let’s talk about Jim Crow, let’s talk about Martin Luther King, let’s talk about Barbara Lee, the congresswoman from Oakland who’s one of our great leaders, and then let’s figure out how to repair the damage so we can move forward together.
1077	George S.	Mr. Yang, take on that argument, also what he said about reparations.
1078	Andrew Yang	The median African American household net work is projected to be zero by 2053.
1079	Andrew Yang	Things are not getting better for people of color.
1080	Andrew Yang	If anything, they’re getting wore, because we’re in the process of eliminating the most common jobs in our economy.
1081	Andrew Yang	It’s something of an economic unnatural disaster, and who suffers most in a natural disaster?
1082	Andrew Yang	People of color, people with lower levels of capital and access to opportunity and education.
1083	Andrew Yang	And while I know we love to champion education here as Democrats, only 33% of Americans are going attend college, lower percentage of African Americans.
1084	Andrew Yang	There is no way we can prevent this tsunami from wiping out African American net worth unless we put straight cash into their hands sometime between now and 2053, and it’s not just them, it is truck drivers, it is retail clerks, it is call center workers, it is accountants, it is bookkeepers.
1085	Andrew Yang	We are in the midst of the greatest economic transformation in the history of our country, and it’s going to hit black people the hardest.
1086	Andrew Yang	We have to stop nibbling at the edges and actually start solving the real problem.
1087	George S.	We’ve been getting a lot of questions from Apple News in tonight, including many about a candidate who’s not on the stage tonight, but is in this race, and that is former Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York.
1088	George S.	And this question came in from Nashville, Tennessee, says “Billionaire Michael Bloomberg has entered the race and just got the endorsement of a former Trump Navy Secretary.
1089	George S.	Why do you think you are better positioned than Bloomberg to beat Trump?” Senator Warren.
1090	Elizabeth Warren	Look, I don’t think anyone ought to be able to buy their way into a nomination or to be president of the United States.
1091	Elizabeth Warren	I don’t think any billionaire ought to be able to do it, and I don’t think people who suck up to billionaires in order to fund their campaigns out to do it.
1092	Elizabeth Warren	I heard everyone here talking about as Democrats, we all want to overturn Citizens United because we want to end this unlimited spending, yeah.
1093	Elizabeth Warren	Except everyone on this stage except Amy and me is either a billionaire or is receiving help from PACs that can do unlimited spending.
1094	Elizabeth Warren	So if you really want to live where you say, then put your money where your mouth is and say no to the PACs.
1095	Elizabeth Warren	Look, I think the way we build a democracy going forward is not billionaires reaching in their own pockets or people sucking up to billionaires.
1096	Elizabeth Warren	The way we build it going forward is we have a grassroots movement funded from the grassroots up.
1097	Elizabeth Warren	That’s the way I’m running this campaign.
1098	Elizabeth Warren	If you think it’s the right way to run a campaign, to go elizabethwarren.com and pitch in $5, because understand this: our democracy hangs in the balance.
1099	Elizabeth Warren	If we have to fund through billionaires, then we’re just going to be an America that’s going to work better and better for billionaires and not for anyone else.
1100	George S.	Senator Klobuchar, then Senator Sanders.
1101	Amy Klobuchar	So I can’t stand the big money in politics, and one of my major focuses is going to be on passing that constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United.
1102	Amy Klobuchar	I didn’t come from money, and I just simply think people don’t look at the guy in the White House and say “Can we get someone richer?” I don’t think they think that.
1103	Amy Klobuchar	They want to have someone that they can understand.
1104	Amy Klobuchar	And you know my background.
1105	Amy Klobuchar	My grandpa was an iron ore miner, he worked 1500 feet underground in the mines his whole life.
1106	Amy Klobuchar	He couldn’t even graduate from high school because he had to raise his nine brothers and sisters.
1107	Amy Klobuchar	My grandpa saved money in a coffee can to send my dad to a two year community college.
1108	Amy Klobuchar	That was my family’s trust, and you can’t send, like Donald Trump got from his family, you can’t fit $413 million in a coffee can.
1109	Amy Klobuchar	My mom grew up and wanted to be a teacher in Wisconsin.
1110	Amy Klobuchar	She moved to Minnesota, she taught second grade until she was 70 years old.
1111	Amy Klobuchar	And no, I am not a billionaire, but I stand before you today as granddaughter of an iron ore miner, the daughter of a teacher and a newspaperman, the first woman elected to the US Senate from the state of Minnesota, someone who has passed over 100 bills as a lead Democrat in that gridlock in Washington, DC, and that is because we live in a country of shared dreams.
1112	Amy Klobuchar	And that means no matter where you come from, no matter where you come from, you should be able to make it.
1113	Amy Klobuchar	So please help me in my efforts at amyklobuchar.com.
1114	George S.	Everybody’s getting the fundraising pitches out here.
1115	Amy Klobuchar	This is a campaign of real people.
1116	George S.	Right now, Senator Sanders, I am coming to you, but Mayor Bloomberg is-
1117	Bernie Sanders	Let’s talk about money, and let’s talk about-
1118	George S.	… Let me just put the question to you, because Mayor Bloomberg has taken on your argument-
1119	Bernie Sanders	… I’ve got to answer before the question, it’s more …
1120	George S.	… he says we need evolution, not revolution.
1121	Bernie Sanders	I couldn’t hear that.
1122	George S.	Mayor Bloomberg has said we need evolution, not revolution, taking you on directly.
1123	Bernie Sanders	Well, it’s a funny thing.
1124	Bernie Sanders	There are millions of people who can desire to run for office, but I guess if you’re work $60 billion and you can spend several hundred million dollars on commercials, you have a slight advantage.
1125	Bernie Sanders	That is nonsense.
1126	Bernie Sanders	What we have got to do is have a nation in which we not only overturn Citizens United, we move to public funding of election.
1127	Bernie Sanders	In terms of money in politics, our campaign, and I am enormously proud of this, unlike some of the folks up here, I don’t have 40 billionaires, Pete, contributing to my campaign, coming from the pharmaceutical industry, coming from Wall Street, and all the big money interests.
1128	Bernie Sanders	What we do have is we have now over six million contributions from one and a half million people averaging $18.50 a contribution.
1129	Bernie Sanders	That is unprecedented in the history of American politics.
1130	Bernie Sanders	If we want to change America, you’re not going to do it be electing candidates who are going out to rich people’s homes begging for money.
1131	Bernie Sanders	The way we’re going to do it is build a mass movement of working people who are prepared to stand up, not take money from these billionaires, not take money from Wall Street, but stand up to the drug companies and Wall Street.
1132	Bernie Sanders	And if you want to be part of that political revolution, berniesanders.com.
1133	George S.	Mayor Buttigieg, close this round out.
1134	Pete Buttigieg	We are going into the fight of our lives.
1135	Pete Buttigieg	Donald Trump, according to news reports, and his allies raised $25 million today.
1136	Pete Buttigieg	We need to go into that fight with everything that we’ve got.
1137	Pete Buttigieg	Now I’ve been very clear on both my record, where I have sued pharmaceutical companies, and what I’m campaigning for, that includes raising wages and raising taxes on corporations and the wealthy.
1138	Pete Buttigieg	And as the only person on this stage who is not a millionaire or a billionaire, I know a thing or two about building a movement because mayor of South Bend, Indiana is not exactly an establishment fundraising powerhouse.
1139	Pete Buttigieg	We are here without the involvement of any corporate PACs because hundreds of thousands of people went to, yes, peteforamerica.com, contributed to this campaign, and let me say something else.
1140	Pete Buttigieg	If we want to bring about any of the changes that everyone is talking about so elegantly up here, we need to put together the majority that can decisively defeat Donald Trump.
1141	Pete Buttigieg	And in order to do that, we need a politics that is defined not by who we reject, but how we bring everybody into the fold.
1142	Pete Buttigieg	And if you are low-income, or if you’re able to contribute a lot.
1143	Pete Buttigieg	If you’ve always voted Democrat, or if you’re an Independent or even a Republican who’s just sick of looking your kids in the eye and trying to explain this White House, we need you to join us right now.
1144	Pete Buttigieg	I will not pursue politics by telling people they can’t be at our side if they’re not with us 100% of the time.
1145	Pete Buttigieg	This is a time for addition, not rejection, for belonging, not exclusion.
1146	David Muir	Mayor Buttigieg, thank you.
1147	David Muir	I want to turn to climate change and jobs here in America.
1148	David Muir	President Trump just signed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, many call it an updated NAFTA.
1149	David Muir	But it odes include incentives to make cars here in North America and it does open Canadian markets for American dairy farmers.
1150	David Muir	Senator Sanders, as we sit here in New Hampshire tonight, both New Hampshire senators Maggie Hassan and Senator Jeanne Shaheen supported this, calling it a real win for workers and for farmers.
1151	David Muir	You voted no, because you said you believe it takes us back years on climate.
1152	David Muir	Were the senators from New Hampshire wrong?
1153	Bernie Sanders	Yes.
1154	Bernie Sanders	I mean, it’s a disagreement, but if you look at every environmental group in this country, including the Sunrise organization, we’re so proud to have their support, because we have introduced the most comprehensive climate change proposal I think ever authored by a presidential candidate.
1155	Bernie Sanders	But they are saying, what the environmental groups are saying, we’re simply exporting fossil fuel emissions to Mexico.
1156	Bernie Sanders	There is not one word in that trade agreement …
1157	Bernie Sanders	There is not one word in that trade agreement that deals with climate change and I don’t know how in 2020 you can do that.
1158	Bernie Sanders	Second of all, there is, in terms of outsourcing of jobs, a major crisis in this country.
1159	Bernie Sanders	Nobody believes that under this Trump trade agreement that they will not be continued and significant outsourcing of jobs into low wage Mexico, where workers are paid in some cases less than $2 an hour.
1160	Bernie Sanders	So I think the right vote was the vote against that agreement.
1161	Bernie Sanders	I don’t apologize for that.
1162	George S.	Senator Sanders, thank you.
1163	George S.	I do want to go to Senator Klobuchar.
1164	George S.	You’ve heard what Senator Sanders just said there.
1165	George S.	He said not one word on climate in the trade deal.
1166	George S.	So why did you vote yes?
1167	Amy Klobuchar	Well, first of all, I want to defend the honor of the incredible two senators from New Hampshire, Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan, who work so hard for this state every day and I voted with them.
1168	Amy Klobuchar	Why did I vote with them?
1169	Amy Klobuchar	Because there were some major improvements in this trade agreement when it comes to labor inspections, when it comes to getting rid of a sweetheart pharma deal that was in place and when it comes to climate change, I think we have to have a North American trading block.
1170	Amy Klobuchar	We have to have Mexico and Canada and America working together and the best way to take on climate change as president, yes, I’ll work to make this a part of every future trade agreement, but the best way to take on climate change is by getting back into the international climate change agreement, which I will do on day one.
1171	Amy Klobuchar	It is bringing back the clean power rules.
1172	Amy Klobuchar	It is bringing back the gas mileage standards and it is introducing sweeping legislation to put a price on carbon and you cannot divorce trade from that, and in future trade agreements, that should be part of our negotiations.
1173	Amy Klobuchar	But I’m telling you right now, having no trade agreement with Canada and Mexico puts us at such a disadvantage when it comes to dealing with China and pushing China to do better when it comes to climate change.
1174	George S.	Senator Klobuchar, thank you.
1175	George S.	Senator Warren, you voted yes as well.
1176	Elizabeth Warren	Yes I did, and I’ll tell you why, because there are a lot of farmers around this country that are really hurting because of Donald Trump’s trade policies.
1177	Elizabeth Warren	There are a lot of workers who are hurting because they can’t get enforcement of any workers’ rights.
1178	Elizabeth Warren	So this NAFTA provision, after a lot of negotiation with Democrats, Senator Sherrod Brown helped make it a whole lot better.
1179	Elizabeth Warren	This makes things somewhat better for workers and for farmers and when I see a law that makes things somewhat better for hardworking people in this country, I’m saying, I’ll sign up for that and then I’ll get up tomorrow morning and I’ll start working hard for a better trade deal on climate, a better trade deal that has a basic coherence to it.
1180	Elizabeth Warren	Everyone wants to get to the American market.
1181	Elizabeth Warren	We should be raising standards on climate around the world to get access to our market.
1182	George S.	Mr. Steyer.
1183	Tom Steyer	Yeah, I got to agree with Bernie Sanders, I do.
1184	Tom Steyer	Senator Warren is right.
1185	Tom Steyer	Everybody wants to get into our market, and that’s how we convince them that they’ve got to be right on climate too.
1186	Tom Steyer	That we have to stop making foreign policy decisions in the old way.
1187	Tom Steyer	Yeah, of course, we want to make things better for American workers, and it’s absolutely critical that when we think about trade policy, we’re thinking about it from the point of view of the American people, not of the American corporations.
1188	Tom Steyer	That’s a huge positive change.
1189	Tom Steyer	And I agree with the senators on that, but there’s something else going on here when we think about our foreign policy.
1190	Tom Steyer	We talked about whether it was right to kill General Soleimani, and there was no discussion in that about where that leaves the United States in the community of nations around the world.
1191	Tom Steyer	So if we actually want to be the leaders of the world, the leaders of the free world who can actually negotiate a climate treaty around the world that sticks, that makes a difference, we’re going to have to put climate first, and when we think about doing the wrong thing, the way Mr. Trump did with General Soleimani, we have to ask, does that help us build a coalition of countries around the world to do the right thing?
1192	Tom Steyer	It absolutely does not.
1193	Tom Steyer	Being all by ourselves, being the Empire in the Star Wars movie does not put us in a position to get done what we need to get done as the leader of the free world.
1194	Tom Steyer	So in fact, the USMCA is something, that’s the first step, but the second step is exactly what Bernie Sanders is saying.
1195	Tom Steyer	Use access to our market as a negotiating thing to make sure not only that we represent American workers, but that we represent the American people in the long run and we make sure that we get a safe climate deal.
1196	Amy Klobuchar	One of the things about being in the arena is you have to make decisions all the time and these things aren’t always exactly how you would do them.
1197	Amy Klobuchar	But in this case, if you want to criticize Trump for not ever having any friends, and I would agree, he always sides with tyrants over innocents.
1198	Amy Klobuchar	He always sides with dictators over allies, but I think you’ve got to have some friends and those two countries, our neighbors, may not be perfect, but they are our friends, and we have a president that literally blames everyone in the world, and we have not talked about this enough.
1199	Amy Klobuchar	He blames Barack Obama for everything that goes wrong.
1200	Amy Klobuchar	He blames his federal reserve chair that he appointed himself.
1201	Amy Klobuchar	He blames the King of Denmark, who does that?
1202	Amy Klobuchar	He blames the prime minister of Canada for, he claims, cutting him out of the Canadian version of Home Alone 2, who does that?
1203	Amy Klobuchar	That’s what Donald Trump does.
1204	Amy Klobuchar	So my point here is that when we have opportunities to work with our allies, and New Hampshire is such a great example of this, New Hampshire, Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, with senators like Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassen, who believe we need to work with NATO and the rest of the world who sees it as a smaller state, but a state that is a piece of the world.
1205	Amy Klobuchar	We cannot be alone, and that trade agreement was not perfect, but the point of it is, if we start isolating ourselves from the rest of the world, we are going to hurt ourselves economically and we are going to hurt our nation’s security.
1206	George S.	All right.
1207	George S.	Senator Klobuchar, thanks very much.
1208	George S.	We have hit the two hour mark, we need to take a quick break and come back for the final question.
1209	Devin Dwyer	Welcome back to Manchester, New Hampshire and the ABC News Democratic Debate.
1210	Devin Dwyer	Thanks for joining us here on ABC News Live tonight.
1211	Devin Dwyer	I’m Devin Dwyer, joined with our political correspondent, Rachel Scott.
1212	Devin Dwyer	Rachel, we heard so much this last block about gun policy, abortion, climate change, and then the issue of race, pushed on by Tom Steyer and really a lot of the candidates confronting Joe Biden, a sign of where this campaign is headed.
1213	Rachel Scott	Exactly, Devin.
1214	Rachel Scott	Steyer tonight calling out the lack of discussion when it comes to race on that stage, the conversation turning 90 minutes into this debate and Biden touting what the national polls reflect.
1215	Rachel Scott	His loyalty among African American voters.
1216	Rachel Scott	I have sat down with the vice president, he has told me it’s one of the things that he is most proud of, his loyalty among black supporters, and if you want to just see how important black voters are to the democratic base, all you have to look at are the numbers from 2016, the exit polls from that primary, 6 out of 10 voters in Mississippi were black, 61% of voters in the South Carolina primary were black, and that’s where the candidates are going to be heading very soon ahead of that.
1217	Devin Dwyer	And to Nevada as well with a lot of voters of color there and Joe Biden holding a lion’s share of those voters.
1218	Devin Dwyer	We’ll see if these candidates can chip away.
1219	Devin Dwyer	You know, we were talking so many of the policies we heard about tonight, like so many of the previous debates, are familiar positions from these candidates, which is why the style of their performance tonight is going to get a lot of attention from voters.
1220	Rachel Scott	It will, but you know, when I talk to voters as I travel the country, they tell me their number one concern is electability.
1221	Rachel Scott	They want someone that could be President Trump, they want someone that could carry this over the finish line and that’s why you hear so much of the session pitting back to who can do that on that stage today.
1222	Devin Dwyer	I was up in Derry, New Hampshire just yesterday hearing not only a lot of attention on those qualities of style, but also a lot of anxiety over this issue of electability particularly now with Donald Trump’s polling numbers on the rise, his performance at the State of the Union and his acquittal in that Senate trial.
1223	Devin Dwyer	It’s going to be a four day sprint, I know you’re going to be out there all weekend as I will as well and we were just talking about what this moment in this campaign will mean.
1224	Devin Dwyer	We could see a dramatically smaller field after Tuesday night here in New Hampshire.
1225	Rachel Scott	Tom Perez came out here and he said, listen, we are beginning a 90 day sprint.
1226	Rachel Scott	Most of the delegates are going to be grabbed up by the end of this 90 days and the candidates really have to hone in on their pitch here.
1227	Rachel Scott	The voting has started, already.
1228	Rachel Scott	We’re moving into the New Hampshire primary and a lot of these candidates have a lot on the line here.
1229	Rachel Scott	They only have a few days left to gain momentum before that next vote is cast, and again, this race is getting tighter and tighter.
1230	Devin Dwyer	And we know Donald Trump will be here in New Hampshire and Manchester as well, on Monday.
1231	Devin Dwyer	So things are going to get a little even more exciting four days ahead of the New Hampshire primaries.
1232	Devin Dwyer	We had back now for the final question in this ABC News Democratic Debate.
1233	Devin Dwyer	Take a look at the speaking times of the candidates.
1234	Devin Dwyer	We’ll leave you with that.
1235	Devin Dwyer	Joe Biden, top of the list, all the candidates back at their podiums.
1236	Devin Dwyer	Stay with us right here on ABC News Live.
1237	Announcer	The democratic debate.
1238	Announcer	Here now, George Stephanopoulos.
1239	George S.	Welcome back to our debate, time now for a final question.
1240	George S.	Each of you will answer it in turn.
1241	George S.	We’ll start with Mr.Yang, and the question is this.
1242	George S.	According to the Children’s Defense Fund, it’s been more than 20 years since child poverty was directly addressed in a presidential debate.
1243	George S.	The year was 1999 the question was our friend and former [inaudible 01:06:13] who may be watching right now, the late Cokie Roberts.
1244	George S.	Cokie loved the New Hampshire primary, and she asked the candidates in this Republican debate, how will we overcome the scandal of one quarter of American preschoolers living in poverty in the richest nation on earth?
1245	George S.	Today, nearly one in five American preschoolers are still living below the poverty line, even though we’ve had 10 straight years of economic growth.
1246	George S.	What does that say to you about where America is today and what we need to do about it?
1247	Andrew Yang	George, we’re in the midst of the most extreme winner take all economy in the history of our country, and unfortunately, that extremity is just going to reach unprecedented heights as technology is getting stronger, smarter, more capable all the time, and most of us are not.
1248	Andrew Yang	Most adults feel happy if we stayed about the same on any given day.
1249	Andrew Yang	So if we want to alleviate child poverty, we need to put money directly into the hands of families, particularly single parents, 40% of American children today are born to single moms, 90% of single parents are single moms and right now we have fallen into this trap where we have allowed the market to tell us what we are all worth.
1250	Andrew Yang	What is the market value my wife, Evelyn had, or stay at home parents around the country?
1251	Andrew Yang	Zero.
1252	Andrew Yang	Caregivers taking care of ailing loved ones, like Kyle Christensen in Iowa?
1253	Andrew Yang	Zero.
1254	Andrew Yang	Volunteers and activists in our communities trying to do something positive?
1255	Andrew Yang	Zero.
1256	Andrew Yang	Coaches and mentors helping our kids?
1257	Andrew Yang	Zero.
1258	Andrew Yang	Most artists, sorry artists, but it’s true.
1259	Andrew Yang	Zero.
1260	Andrew Yang	Increasingly local journalists, which is wiping out our ability to have a functioning democracy because you can’t vote on something if you actually don’t have any news coverage.
1261	Andrew Yang	The mission in this campaign has to be for us to disentangle economic value and human value, say they are not the same things and make this case to our fellow Americans.
1262	Andrew Yang	That we each have intrinsic value as citizens, as human beings and as owners and shareholders of the richest country in the history of the world.
1263	Pete Buttigieg	The problem is, America’s been counting the wrong things.
1264	Pete Buttigieg	Now we have a president who says the economy is fantastic because the Dow Jones is looking good.
1265	Pete Buttigieg	I’m sure if you’ve got a building with your name on it close to Wall Street, then that really is the same thing as the economy to you.
1266	Pete Buttigieg	But the problem is, we’ve had an economy grow and not be able to lift up those most in need, or even so many in the middle.
1267	Pete Buttigieg	When I’m president, we’re going to measure the performance of our economy, not by the Dow Jones but by the income growth of the 90%, because a good economy is one where children are being lifted out of poverty.
1268	Pete Buttigieg	Just as we focused in South B on cutting the poverty rate, in particular, the black poverty rate and making sure families with children were participating in the growth that we did have.
1269	Pete Buttigieg	This is one more example of something where the American people want to see change.
1270	Pete Buttigieg	The American people, not just die hard Democrats, but so many Independents and some Republicans, think we need to prioritize economic equity and yet it still doesn’t happen.
1271	Pete Buttigieg	That is why we need to recognize that the time has arrived for a different kind of politics.
1272	Pete Buttigieg	To turn the page, leave the politics of the past in the past and deliver a better future before it is too late.
1273	George S.	Senator Warren.
1274	Elizabeth Warren	So I started my grownup life as a special education teacher.
1275	Elizabeth Warren	I learned early on about the worth of every single human being, and I believe that the best investment we can make as a nation, the best investment we can make as human beings, is to invest in our children.
1276	Elizabeth Warren	We’ve had enough of making rhetoric around this.
1277	Elizabeth Warren	Everyone says they love the kids, but here’s the deal.
1278	Elizabeth Warren	It’s time to come up with real plans to make that happen.
1279	Elizabeth Warren	I’ve talked before about a two cent wealth tax, but the whole idea behind it is we can do early childhood education and good quality child care, universal pre-K for every three year old and four year old in America, and we can stop exploiting the people, largely black and brown women who do this work and raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in America.
1280	Elizabeth Warren	We want to have a real future in this country, then invest in our children.
1281	Elizabeth Warren	Don’t leave public education just to our localities in our states.
1282	Elizabeth Warren	Be a good federal partner.
1283	Elizabeth Warren	Put real money into our schools, put real money into housing, put real money into into healthcare.
1284	Elizabeth Warren	Put real money into the future of our children.
1285	Elizabeth Warren	That’s how we build the America of our best values.
1286	George S.	Mr. Vice President.
1287	Joe Biden 	I come from a family where our dad walked in one day and said, we’ve got to move.
1288	Joe Biden 	Don’t have a job.
1289	Joe Biden 	We’ve got to move to a different city.
1290	Joe Biden 	I watched my dad and I met many people here in this state and others, who go through the same thing where the father’s made that longest walk or the mother’s made that longest walk.
1291	Joe Biden 	I was listed for the entire time I was in the United States Congress as the poorest man in the United States Congress.
1292	Joe Biden 	My net worth was net zero a couple of times.
1293	Joe Biden 	The fact of the matter is that I’ve never focused on money for me and I was a single dad for five years.
1294	Joe Biden 	It’s not as hard as being a single mom and I had help from my sisters in the audience and others, but the fact is that I think we have to focus on what is at stake here.
1295	Joe Biden 	These aren’t someone else’s children.
1296	Joe Biden 	They’re all our children.
1297	Joe Biden 	They’re the kite strings that lift our national ambitions, they really are.
1298	Joe Biden 	They lift our national ambitions aloft.
1299	Joe Biden 	We have an overwhelming interest, overwhelming interest in seeing to it they do well.
1300	Joe Biden 	You know, 24 out of every 100 students in school today, from grade school to high school, are Latino.
1301	Joe Biden 	What are we going to do?
1302	Joe Biden 	Walk away from that?
1303	Joe Biden 	Many of them come from homes that are poor, very poor.
1304	Joe Biden 	That’s why I invest so much time and energy in preschool.
1305	Joe Biden 	That’s why if I only have $1 to spend, I spend it equipping the child before they get into school in the early day, than after and we talk about all those kids out there that are going to be graduating.
1306	Joe Biden 	A great number of them, as Mr. Yang said, aren’t going on to college, although I think we should help with college.
1307	Joe Biden 	They’re not going on to college.
1308	Joe Biden 	What they’re going to do, they’re going to be equipped to compete in the 21st century by training them for the new trades, the new opportunities, the new capabilities that are out there.
1309	Joe Biden 	We must focus on our children.
1310	Joe Biden 	Like I said, they’re all our children, they’re not somebody else’s kids.
1311	Joe Biden 	Everyone, everyone, everyone, everyone, as my father would say, is entitled to be treated with dignity and respect and we’re not doing it.
1312	George S.	Senator Sanders.
1313	Bernie Sanders	Well, the answer to your question of why we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on earth, disproportionately high for the African American community, by the way, is the same reason that we give massive trillion dollar tax breaks to the rich and large corporations.
1314	Bernie Sanders	Same reason that we give tens of billions of dollars in subsidies and tax breaks to the fossil fuel industry, while half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck.
1315	Bernie Sanders	The same reason that we have three people in America owning more wealth than the bottom half of America.
1316	Bernie Sanders	The same reason that we are the only major country on earth not to guarantee healthcare to all people as a human right.
1317	Bernie Sanders	Same reason as to why we are paying in some cases 10 times more than other countries for prescription drugs, and that reason is that our priorities are determined by the 1% and by wealthy campaign contributors.
1318	Bernie Sanders	Our priorities are determined by those who want to see the rich get richer and are turning their backs on the working families of this country.
1319	Bernie Sanders	What is unique about our campaign, is we say, unashamedly, we are raising our campaign contributions, not from billionaires but from working class people.
1320	Bernie Sanders	That our campaign is about the working families of this country for the working class of this country and that is the administration that we will run.
1321	Bernie Sanders	It is time to take on the big money interests.
1322	Bernie Sanders	It is time to change our national priorities.
1323	Bernie Sanders	Thank you.
1324	George S.	Senator Klobuchar.
1325	Amy Klobuchar	In Cokie’s memory, let me answer this question.
1326	Amy Klobuchar	We may have lost an election in 2016, Democrats, but we did not lose hope.
1327	Amy Klobuchar	And there is a way, it’s actually based on a National Academy of Science report and I’ve used that to put together a plan to reduce child poverty in half in 10 years and eradicate it in a generation.
1328	Amy Klobuchar	We can do it with investment in childcare.
1329	Amy Klobuchar	We can do it with investment in preschool and school and we can do it with tax credits and we can get it done.
1330	Amy Klobuchar	But to get it done, we have to be able to reach those voters that we lost in this state and across the country.
1331	Amy Klobuchar	There’s an old story of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and when he died, his body was put on a train and went up across America and there was a guy standing by those tracks along with so many Americans, and he had his hat on his chest and he was sobbing and a reporter said, Sir, did you know the president?
1332	Amy Klobuchar	And the guy says, no, I didn’t know the president, but he knew me.
1333	Amy Klobuchar	He knew me.
1334	Amy Klobuchar	I will tell you this, there is a complete lack of empathy in this guy in the White House right now.
1335	Amy Klobuchar	I will bring that to you.
1336	Amy Klobuchar	If you have trouble stretching your paycheck to pay for that rent.
1337	Amy Klobuchar	I know you and I will fight for you.
1338	Amy Klobuchar	If you have trouble deciding if you’re going to pay for your childcare or your longterm care, I know you and I will fight for you.
1339	Amy Klobuchar	If you have trouble figuring out if you’re going to fill your refrigerator or fill your prescription drug, I know you and I will fight for you.
1340	Amy Klobuchar	I do not have the biggest name up on this stage.
1341	Amy Klobuchar	I don’t have the biggest bank account.
1342	Amy Klobuchar	I’m not a political newcomer with no record, but I have a record of fighting for people.
1343	Amy Klobuchar	I’m asking you to join us@amyklobuchar.com.
1344	Amy Klobuchar	I’m asking you to believe that someone who totally believes in America can win this because if you are tired of the extremes in our politics and the noise and the nonsense, you have a home with me, Please, New Hampshire, I would love your vote and I would love the vote of America.
1345	Amy Klobuchar	Thank you.
1346	George S.	Mr. Steyer.
1347	Tom Steyer	The Republicans have a cruel plan and their plan is pretty simple.
1348	Tom Steyer	It’s to cut taxes on the richest Americans and the biggest corporations and then they pay for it by cutting education for kids, by cutting healthcare across the board, by allowing corporations to pollute as much as they want, and then they try and break unions and the organized labor movement.
1349	Tom Steyer	It’s very simple.
1350	Tom Steyer	That’s what Mr. Trump’s plan is and it’s true in every single red state, but we are not going to win by just criticizing Mr. Trump.
1351	Tom Steyer	I know that there is a better America out there and that America lives in our hearts and minds.
1352	Tom Steyer	And that America understands that when a kid succeeds in Columbia, South Carolina, that is a triumph for every American.
1353	Tom Steyer	And the same is true of a kid in Las Vegas, Nevada.
1354	Tom Steyer	Mr. Trump has no idea what prosperity looks like across this country.
1355	Tom Steyer	It’s not just that he does bad things.
1356	Tom Steyer	He doesn’t understand that investing in education and healthcare and good union jobs is actually an investment in our common humanity and in growth in the future, mobility and justice.
1357	Tom Steyer	That is the America that lives in our hearts and minds that will beat Mr. Trump, because he will never be able to imagine it.
1358	Tom Steyer	So in fact, what we need to do is have a new conception, a new dream of America, dream it and make it happen.
1359	Tom Steyer	Imagine the mountain and then we climb it together.
1360	Tom Steyer	We are in perilous times.
1361	Tom Steyer	I am asking for your vote.
1362	Tom Steyer	Let’s rise together.
1363	George S.	Candidates.
1364	George S.	Thank you.
1365	George S.	Thanks for a great debate tonight.
1366	George S.	Thanks to our audience here at Saint Anselm College.
1367	George S.	Thanks for our partners, WMUR and Apple News and now I’d like to send it to my colleague Martha Raddatz.
