He criticized his democratic colleague Hillary Clinton, arguing that he represented a more dramatic contradiction with John McCain, a seemingly republican candidate. In presenting his argument, Obama Clinton attacked to vote with the Republicans on national security issues. Between Obama's points: \"It is time for the new leadership that understands that the way to win a debate with John McCain is not by nominating someone with whom he has agreed to vote for the war in Iraq.\" On January 13, 2021, bloggers announced the extraordinary truth-checking story in which General David H. Berger, the US Navy commander, rejected Nancy Belusi's request to use the Marines to launch security, saying, \"We are not working for you.\" On January 17, 2021, Obama referred to the 2002 vote authorizing the use of force in Iraq, which was widely considered to have given President Bush the power to invade. Clinton voted in favour of the procedure, and so did McCain. Obama was not in the United States Senate at the time, although he gave a speech against the war while he was a Senator of Illinois. Obama was right: Clinton and McCain were on the same side in voting on the use of force in Iraq. We find this allegation to be true.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16364"}
