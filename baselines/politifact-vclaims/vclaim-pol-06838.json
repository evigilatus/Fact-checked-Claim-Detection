Nathan Deal tried to rectify in his State of the State speech on Wednesday.\n\"Georgia is now the eighth most populous state in the nation, moving from the number 10 position in just four years,\" Deal said.\nPolitical junkies know that with more people comes, at the very least, more Congressional seats. Or, as Deal would have it, evidence that a state is creating jobs and drawing top talent from around the nation.\nBut looking at just the data, is Deal right on the numbers? PolitiFact Georgia decided to check.\nThe question of population falls to the U.S. Census Bureau, which in addition to conducting the decennial count that determines Congressional representation also releases annual population estimates for each state.\nThe latest, pegged to July 1, estimated that 10,097,343 live in Georgia. That\u2019s an increase of 102,584 from 2013, or a little bit larger than the city of Sandy Springs.\nIt\u2019s the first time Georgia reached the milestone of 10 million residents, and it puts the Peach State in 8th place among all states.\nThat means Deal is right on the first part of his statement. But he\u2019s off when comparing to four years ago, and the numbers from the 2010 Census.\nWay back when Betty White was a mere 88 years old, and \"The Walking Dead\" first showed what could happen to Georgia in a zombie apocalypse, the state had 9,687,653 people, Census data show.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Godlewski\n\n\nstated on January 9, 2021 in Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all women that lost jobs (in the December jobs report), it was mostly Black and Latina women. In fact, white women gained employment.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Nusaiba Mizan \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat put Georgia in ninth place in terms of population, just behind Michigan but one slot ahead of neighboring North Carolina.\nBut what about Deal\u2019s bigger point, that our growth is a signal of greater economic development? There, the same data can back him up.\nThe 2014 Census data makes it look as if North Carolina surpassed Michigan in the latest counts. It did \u2013 but Georgia surged past Michigan first, said Robert Bernstein, a spokesman with the agency.\n\"You\u2019ll see it occasionally that a state will surpass another,\" Bernstein said. \"What\u2019s significant here is Michigan was leapfrogged twice, by both Georgia and North Carolina.\"\nPart of that shift is undoubtedly for jobs. The recent announcement that Mercedes-Benz USA will move its headquarters to metro Atlanta does not take people from Michigan, long the home to the nation\u2019s auto industry.\nBut it is another example of the gradual creation of the Southeast as the industry\u2019s new hub. Chris Carr, the commissioner of Georgia\u2019s Department of Economic Development, said Georgia had earlier lost out to Alabama for Mercedes\u2019 new manufacturing plant.\nBut the state left a good enough impression for the firm to consider it for its new headquarters, in part because Georgia\u2019s growth is good for customers and workers alike, he said.\n\"When companies are looking for a place to go, they need the right business climate but they want to make sure they are taking care of their employees and have a great place to live, too,\" Carr said.\n\"There is a psychological impact that we are growing, that shows people there is a reason to be here,\" Carr said.\nThat was the point Deal was trying to make, when he claimed Georgia is now the 8th most populous state and moved up two spots in just four years.\nThe governor was off on the state\u2019s ranking four years ago. We only moved up one spot. But he is right about where the state\u2019s population is now \u2013 and how that population can tie to jobs.\nWe rate Deal\u2019s statement Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06838"}
