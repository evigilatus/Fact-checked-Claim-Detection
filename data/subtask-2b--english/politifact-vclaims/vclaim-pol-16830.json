The latter.\nA Nov. 7 post with a screenshot of what looks vaguely like a news article reported that \"Kid tells mall Santa a secret; seconds later, him (sic) and his friends are beating the cr*p out of a child molester.\"\nTwo images are side by side. One shows police arresting a man in a Santa Claus costume. The other is a pixelated image of man\u2019s face.\n\"A Wisconsin mall Santa decided to handle one of the naughty list members early this year, when a young girl told him her Christmas wish was for her step dad to stop molesting her,\" the article said. \"He and four of his elves attacked the guy, who was waiting nearby, and pummeled him unconscious.\"\nThe story\u2019s byline \u2013\u2013 \"Thug Muncher\" \u2013\u2013 gives the first hint that this might not be legit.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe words of a purported eyewitness also seem over the top.

That version placed the episode in Milwaukee. The Milwaukee police told the Associated Press soon after that they had no record of the event.\nThe website Snopes traced the second photo, the one of the man, to a 2012 mugshot.\nNo need to regift this bit of fake news.\nWe rate it Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16830"}
