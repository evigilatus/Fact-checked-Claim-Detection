Bernie Sanders was talking about the topic he might have best known about: economic inequality. Sanders told the cheerful public that, if elected, he intended to pay his many proposals - including making public colleges and universities free of tuition fees and clearing students' debts - with his recently proposed wealth tax. He said that this was \"a time of enormous and strange income and inequality in wealth in America.\" \"49% of all new income goes to the top 1%,\" said Sanders, while the usual talking points beat the gap between the richest nation and all -- which we've verified before -- and promised that if elected, \"the billionaire class and profitable large companies will start paying their fair share of taxes.\" While at the beginning of 2015, Saunders was using a clearer version of the same claim, almost all income growth at that time went to the top 1%. We assessed that most votes were valid, and that finding Sanders accurately represented a rather limited research study, albeit widely cited on the basis of federal tax data. However, the discrepancy between Saunders &apos; new figure - which refers to income growth - and the figure that existed a few years ago gave us a pause, so we decided to take a closer look. It was found that his last statement concerned an updated version of the same study. Once again, it is accurately quoted. But, as last time, there are many warnings that deserve to be taken into account. His claim was based on the latest update of the study by Emmanuel Sayes, Professor of Economics at the University of California, Berkeley, who uses pre-tax income reported in Internal Revenue Service files to compare the highest income dating back to 1913. As the Sayes report states, it is the only source of data that extends this far. The March update highlights his finding that the inflation-adjusted average household income increased by 14 per cent from 2009 to 2017, the latest year for which data on the internal sobriety system are available. However, growth in the aftermath of the Great Depression was uneven, as can be seen, with higher incomes of 38%, while lower incomes of 99% grew only 8.7%. \"At this time, the highest 1% of income gains during this recovery period,\" I concluded Says. This supports the shape that Sanders used. But S\u00e1ez's work does not include the income it receives from government programs such as social security, food stamps, unemployment benefits, or health insurance benefits. Other studies explaining these important factors of income, together with income after taxes - including income from Says - suggest a more narrow gap in income growth. At a press conference on June 1, 2016, Bruce Ronner mentioned \"We have less family income in Illinois today than we did 17 years ago in Illinois... because of the control of Speaker Michael Madigan and Democrats.\" \u2022 July 13, 2016, because Says' accounts are based on prior tax income, his work does not explain the other way in which the federal government redistributes revenues by requiring the rich to pay a larger share of taxes. This is very important here, given that Sanders was talking about the need to raise taxes on the very rich. \"If you want to have a comprehensive measure of how Americans pay their bills, we have to add all sources of income and we have to subtract taxes taken from our salary before we even get it,\" said the economist Gary Bertless, a colleague at the Brookings Institution. In a report published last year, the economist at the Urban Institute, Stephen Rose, surveyed a series of recent studies on income inequality, highlighting how differences in methodology \"have a significant impact on results\" and identified the Syz Sanders series, which he cited as a clear paradox. The Sayes report, from which Sanders derived, also takes the starting point for the end of one of the worst economic recessions in the country. The experts told us that this is an important point that we should bear in mind because the country's largest income-holders experienced the largest percentage of income declines during the recession, meaning that the gains they recorded during the first few years of recovery as the stock market began to recover were particularly large but are now growing more slowly than ever. Governor Sanders said \"49% of all new income goes to the top 1%.\" This is a reference to the growth in pre-tax benefit income and the Government &apos; s acceptance during the economic recovery following the major recession from 2009 to 2017, which was calculated by one of the leading experts in income inequality research. However, it is not the only way to measure income, and other economists with whom we spoke referred to more comprehensive studies, although slightly more history, comparing income growth after calculating what people pay the government and what they receive from it. We assess Sanders' claim mostly true. It is almost true that the statement is accurate but requires further clarification or information.
