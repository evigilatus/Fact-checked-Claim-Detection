Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, said policy makers have another lever they could pull.\nWomen, she said, are a phenomenal source of growth.\n\"In the United States, if there was equal participation of women in the labor market, GDP would be up by 5 percent,\" Lagarde said on CBS\u2019 Face the Nation Dec. 9.\nWe wondered, how solid is the method behind the 5 percent prediction?\nKey takeaways\n\n\nAdding millions of people to the workforce would give the economy a shot in the arm.\n\n\nThe formula behind the 5 percent is simplistic.\n\n\nKey factors, such as how quickly the change happened, would lead to very different economic results in the near term.\n\n\nA 2012 estimate\nWe asked the IMF for Lagarde\u2019s supporting data and didn\u2019t hear back. But a 2012 article from Booz, an accounting and consulting firm now owned by Price Waterhouse Cooper, made the case, and many groups have cited it ever since.\n\"Our own estimates indicate that raising female employment to male levels could have a direct impact on GDP of 5 percent in the United States,\" the authors wrote.\nHow did they get there?\nThe Booz article, sponsored by a women\u2019s advocacy fund, said that GDP per person is the result of productivity, the number of hours worked, the fraction of people of working age in the population as a whole, and the fraction of people actually working.\nSimple math dictates that if you increase the last variable, you get a higher GDP per person. The analysis factored in a couple of adjustments that brought the result down for large numbers of women getting into the job market. New workers would have less experience and be less productive. And given the demands of caring for children, many women, the authors said, would choose to work part-time.\nBut even with those analytic haircuts, the results were still impressively positive.\n16 million women\nGovernment surveys tell us that the fraction of American women in the workforce is 57 percent. For men, the number is 69.1 percent. Today, about 75 million women are either working or looking for work. To bring that up to the labor participation rate of men, there would need to be 91 million, or an additional 16 million women ready and able to work.\nThe fraction of women in the workforce grew rapidly for decades, but in the past 20 years, it has largely leveled out.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Boysko\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in a committee debate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe United States is the only industrialized, modernized country that does not already have a paid family medical leave program in place.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA gap between theory and reality\nDevelopment economists told us that broadly speaking, the report makes the valid point that adding a lot of women to the workforce would boost the economy. Beyond that, the results are dodgy.\n\"It is essentially a back-of-the-envelope calculation, used by others to arrive quickly at numbers for advocacy's sake,\" Elizabeth King, an economist and senior fellow with the Brookings Institution. \"Would I put my bet on the numbers? \u00a0Not likely.\"\nKing said the study\u2019s formula is static and failed to look at important ripple effects, such as whether men might change their own labor habits if their wives entered the job market. The formula didn\u2019t account for how wages might fall with so many new workers.\nBetsey Stevenson, associate professor of economics at the University of Michigan, said the article skips over how long it would take for the economic impact to play out.\n\"The 5 percent number is saying this is what GDP will be once they are all working compared to now, but is silent on how long it will take, precisely because that's almost impossible to predict,\" Stevenson said.\nStevenson observed that the participation rate for women has barely changed since 1990. One likely constraint is the limited options for affordable child care, she said. Even if the country moved to fix that, there would be a lag.\n\"It would take a few years for that policy change to fully raise female employment and thus impact GDP,\" she said.\nSupport from history\nWhatever the weaknesses of the analysis behind Lagarde\u2019s statement, a rising fraction of working women helped drive growth in the United States.\nJanet Yellen, former head of the Federal Reserve, weighed in during a speech in 2017.\n\"Between 1948 and 1990, the rise in female participation contributed about half a percentage point per year to the potential growth rate of real gross domestic product,\" Yellen said at a conference at Brown University.\nThe impact at the end of that period was particularly strong, Stevenson said.\n\"In the 1970s and 1980s, 20 percent of GDP growth was due to women's increased work \u2013\u2013 both increasing participation and hours worked,\" she said. \"That means that GDP today is roughly 13 percent bigger than it would be if women still worked like they did back at the start of the 1970s.\"\nStevenson faulted the study in its details but said it was roughly right on the scale of the impact of new women workers.\nOur ruling\nLagarde said if women were in the American workforce at the same rate as men, the country\u2019s GDP would be up by 5 percent. The likely source is a 2012 article that used a simple formula to yield the 5 percent result.\nTwo economists told us that the article\u2019s approach skipped over several key factors, such as how quickly GDP would change and how the entry of millions of new women workers might change other aspects of the labor market and put a drag on economic growth.\nBut in the end, it is generally accurate that if millions of women got into the job market, the economy would grow more than if they didn\u2019t.\nWe rate this claim Half True.\n Share the Facts 2018-12-12 18:56:38 UTC   PolitiFact    4 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Half True  \"In the United States, if there was equal participation of women in the labor market, GDP would be up by 5 percent.\"     Christine Lagarde Managing director of the IMF https://www.cbsnews.com/news/transcript-christine-lagarde-on-face-the-nation-december-9-2018/   In an interview with CBS News' Face the Nation Sunday, December 9, 2018 2018-12-09    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01196"}
