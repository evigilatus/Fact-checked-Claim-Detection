The focus of the commentary was a five-point list of recommendations. \"Black people,\" Lemon said, \"if you really want to fix the problem, here's just five things that you should think about doing.\"\nThe No. 1 item on that list -- \"and probably the most important,\" he said -- had to do with out-of-wedlock births.\n\"Just because you can have a baby, it doesn't mean you should,\" Lemon said. \"Especially without planning for one or getting married first. More than 72 percent of children in the African-American community are born out of wedlock. That means absent fathers. And the studies show that lack of a male role model is an express train right to prison and the cycle continues.\"\nLemon\u2019s commentary inspired a firestorm of criticism on social media -- the website Mediaite published a sampling -- and bloggers took aim at his conclusions.\n\"If Lemon really wanted to help the black community, he could start by adopting a deeper understanding of the history, sociology and psychology of his own people,\" wrote Washington Post blogger Rahiel Tesfamariam. \"Offering made-for-TV analysis about deeply complex social issues in the manner in which he did is irresponsible and lacks intellectual rigor.\"\nWe can\u2019t check Lemon\u2019s opinions, but we did want to take a look at the one verifiable fact he offered. Is it correct that \"more than 72 percent of children in the African-American community are born out of wedlock\"?\nWe turned to data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which publishes a report every year that includes a wealth of data about births in America. The most recent report, published in August 2012, is based on data from 2010.\nThe report broke down statistics by ethnic groups. Here\u2019s a summary\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nRacial or ethnic group\n\n\nPercent of births considered \"non-marital\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsian Americans and Pacific Islanders\n\n\n17 percent\n\n\n\n\nNon-Hispanic whites\n\n\n29 percent\n\n\n\n\nHispanics\n\n\n53 percent\n\n\n\n\nAmerican Indian and Native Alaskans\n\n\n66 percent\n\n\n\n\nNon-Hispanic blacks\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n73 percent\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nSo Lemon is correct that \"more than 72 percent of children in the African-American community are born out of wedlock.\" To make sure we weren\u2019t missing something, we asked two population experts -- Tom W. Smith, a senior fellow at the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago, and Douglas Massey, professor at Princeton University's Office of Population Research -- and they agreed that the statistic is the best available.\nLemon did overreach somewhat when he went on to say that the 72 percent \"out of wedlock\" figure \"means absent fathers.\" The 72 percent figure refers to children who are born to women who are not married; it would, however, include unmarried couples in which the father is present.\nThat said, the rate of African-American children living in single-parent homes is almost as high as the rate for non-marital births.\nThe chart below summarizes 2011 Census Bureau data compiled by Kids Count, a project of the Annie E. Casey Foundation. The group defined \"children in single-parent families\" as kids under 18 who live with their own single parent; it includes children living with a parent and a cohabiting adult, but it does not include children living with married step-parents.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nRacial or ethnic group\n\n\nChildren in single-parent families\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsian Americans and Pacific Islanders\n\n\n17 percent\n\n\n\n\nNon-Hispanic whites\n\n\n25 percent\n\n\n\n\nHispanics\n\n\n42 percent\n\n\n\n\nAmerican Indian and Native Alaskans\n\n\n53 percent\n\n\n\n\nNon-Hispanic blacks\n\n\n67 percent\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nWe should note that this data doesn\u2019t suggest that 67 percent of African-American children have no contact with their father (or a father figure), but rather that their father does not live in the same household with them.\nOur ruling\nLemon said that \"more than 72 percent of children in the African-American community are born out of wedlock.\" Federal data confirms that 73 percent of African-American births in 2010 were out of wedlock. Estimates for the percentage of African-American children growing up in single-parent households are slightly lower, at 67 percent. Finally, black children counted in these statistics may have contact outside the household with their biological father. But Lemon's statistic was accurate, and we rate his statement True.\n\u00a0\n Share the Facts   Politifact    1 7  Politifact Rating: True  \"More than 72 percent of children in the African-American community are born out of wedlock.\"    Don Lemon CNN anchor   In a commentary on CNN Saturday, July 27, 2013 07/27/2013    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09052"}
