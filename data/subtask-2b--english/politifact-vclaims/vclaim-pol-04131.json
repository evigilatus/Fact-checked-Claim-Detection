Here, we\u2019ll focus on his claim that \"more than half\" of meetings Clinton took as secretary of state were with major donors to her family\u2019s global charity.\nPence\u2019s claim comes from an Associated Press story published in August, headlined, \"Many donors to Clinton Foundation met with her at State.\"\nBut \"many\" does not mean \"more than half\" of all her meetings. Not even close.\nClinton served as secretary of state from 2009-13. The Associated Press analyzed 154 of her State Department meetings and found that 85 of those were with Clinton Foundation donors. Those 85 gave as much as $156 million to the foundation, combined.\nBut this is a tiny subset of Clinton\u2019s meetings.\nThe analysis excluded meetings with people who work for the U.S. government or foreign governments. And it does not include many meetings Clinton took in the second half of her term because the Associated Press only had access to detailed schedules from the first half.\nABC reported back in 2013 that Clinton met with 1,700 foreign leaders and had 755 meetings at the White House while secretary of state. So that\u2019s at least 2,455 meetings the Associated Press did not include in its analysis\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press mischaracterized its own reporting in a post on Twitter claiming that \"More than half those who met Clinton as Cabinet secretary gave money to Clinton Foundation.\" The AP later deleted the tweet.\nPence described the donors as major. According to the AP, at least 40 of the 85 donors Clinton met with contributed more than $100,000 each. Twenty gave more than $1 million, the AP reported.\nThe Associated Press report showcases the ethical minefield that resulted from the lack of a bright line separating Clinton\u2019s State Department from her family\u2019s foundation. However, merely showing that Clinton met with some foundation donors does not in itself prove any substantial wrongdoing, such as undue influence over State Department policy.\nFor example, the Associated Press article mentions meetings with foundation donors Muhammad Yunus, a Nobel Peace Prize-winning economist from Bangladesh, and Nancy McMahon, head of MAC AIDS, which was partnering with the State Department to address gender-based violence in South Africa.\nState Department spokesman Mark Toner told the Associated Press that the department does not prohibit meetings with \"political campaigns, nonprofits or foundations \u2014 including the Clinton Foundation.\"\nOur ruling\nPence said, \"We know that more than half of Hillary Clinton's meetings while she was secretary of state were given to major contributors of the Clinton Foundation.\"\nPence inaccurately described an Associated Press report.\nThe report found that of 154 meetings Clinton took with private individuals over about half of her time as secretary of state, 85 were with people who had donated to the foundation. But the analysis leaves out thousands of meetings Clinton took, including every time she met with employees of both U.S. and foreign governments. It also only covers part of her time as secretary of state.\nWe rate Pence's claim Mostly\u00a0False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04131"}
