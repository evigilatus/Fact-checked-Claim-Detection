Despite the fact that the Politico article stated, \"Biden hasn\u2019t been actively exploring the presidential options himself, and is far from making any decision about whether he\u2019ll run,\" the Your News Wire article writes that it says that Biden is preparing for his campaign announcement.\nThere is no evidence that is happening.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe hoax goes on to say that Biden has chosen Obama -- whom he used to serve under as vice president -- to be his running mate. The story claims that it would be legal under constitutional law for the two to run together, but two-term presidents have traditionally taken an unspoken vow to retire from public life.\nThe 22nd Amendment prohibits a president from being elected for more than two terms, but it does not explicitly mention a former president being elected as vice president. However, the 12th Amendment\u00a0states that \"no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-President of the United States.\"\nThe unspoken vow two-term presidents take is also exaggerated. There is no obligation for a two-term president to stay out of public life. Since he left office, Obama has given public speeches at universities and is working on new books.\nThe article goes on to quote two different real stories from the Hill\u00a0newspaper,\u00a0but it only provides a link to one changing the context of the quotes given in different stories regarding speculation of Biden\u2019s bid.\nQuotes from Biden\u2019s aides about Biden and Obama reclaiming the White House were also made up. When searching for these quotes, the only results we found came from the Your News Wire story.\nWe rate this headline Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02285"}
