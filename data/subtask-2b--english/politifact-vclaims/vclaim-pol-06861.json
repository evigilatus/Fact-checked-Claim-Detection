He estimated that Rhode Island spends $40 million annually fighting marijuana.)\nWe decided to focus on the first half of his statement, dealing with Colorado revenue.\nWe asked Aubin where he got his numbers. He responded that he relied on the State of Colorado's Department of Revenue, as well as a story from Channel 7-KMGH, the Denver ABC News affiliate.\nWe pulled Colorado\u2019s tax records ourselves. We added up the monthly figures, from Jan. 1, 2014, when the first recreational marijuana stores opened, through Oct. 31, the most recent report.\nWe determined that the state\u2019s total marijuana tax revenue was about $60 million.\nThe revenue comes from a 2.9-percent retail and medical marijuana sales tax; a 10-percent retail marijuana special sales tax; and a 15-percent marijuana excise tax, plus application and license fees for retail and medical marijuana.\nIn other words, Aubin got his number right. We were curious about where the money went.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColorado tax records show that a portion of the revenue from marijuana retail sales \u00a0is distributed to local governments where stores are located, including Denver and the ski resort towns of Breckenridge and Telluride, based on tax revenue brought in from marijuana sales in those communities. Denver, for example, received $128,586.\nMost of the money goes into the state general fund. But voters dedicated the first $40 million in excise taxes annually to a statewide school construction fund, administered by the state Department of Education. So far, that \u00a0tax has generated $10 million for the fund.\nThe monthly revenue from marijuana has increased steadily. In January, the total collected in taxes and fee was $3.5 million; in October, it was $7.6 million.\nWe also looked at news articles about the tax implications of legalizing marijuana. One, by Associated Press writer Kristen Wyatt, reports that estimates for tax potential from marijuana sales vary widely. States with legalized recreational marijuana sales could see their revenue drop as more states move to legalize. \u00a0\nAnother story, by Associated Press reporter Gene Johnson, detailed how tax revenues from legal sales of marijuana \u00a0were being undercut by regular users buying medical or black-market marijuana to avoid the higher taxes.\nOfficials in Colorado and Washington, two of the four states that have legalized sale of recreational marijuana, are \u00a0considering ways to rein in the medical marijuana system and to reduce the tax differential between medical and retail sales.\nFor the record, Rhode Island legalized medical marijuana in 2006. In 2013, it decriminalized possession of small amounts of non-medical marijuana; anyone caught with up to one ounce is subject to a $150 fine instead of facing a misdemeanor criminal charge.\nOur ruling\nJames Aubin wrote that \"Colorado raked in $60 million in marijuana taxes and licensing fees in the past year \u2026\".\nDocuments we reviewed from the Colorado Department of Revenue showed that total marijuana revenue from taxes and fees was about $60 million between Jan. 1 through Oct. 31, 2014.\nOf course, this figure tells only part of the story about Colorado\u2019s legalization of marijuana. There are also costs, including administrative expenses and societal costs yet to be determined. But those are beyond the scope of this fact-check.\nWe rate Aubin\u2019s claim as True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06861"}
