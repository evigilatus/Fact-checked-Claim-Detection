It\u00a0has been in place for over three decades and was retooled after 9/11.\nThe system (which exists) and how it works\nThe vetting begins with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugee, which determines who counts as a refugee, who should be resettled (about 1 percent) and which countries would take them. This alone can take four to 10 months.\nIf the UNHCR refers refugees to the United States, they then face scrutiny from federal intelligence and security agencies.\nTheir names, biographical information and fingerprints are run through federal terrorism and criminal databases. Meanwhile, the refugees are interviewed by Department of Homeland Security officials. If approved, they then undergo a medical screening, a match with sponsor agencies, \"cultural orientation\" classes and one final security clearance.\nSyrian refugees in particular must clear one additional hurdle. Their documents are placed under extra scrutiny and cross-referenced with classified and unclassified information.\nThe process typically takes one to two years or longer and happens before a refuge ever steps onto American soil. Ultimately, says the State Department, about half are approved, and there\u2019s no real precedent of a terrorist slipping in through the vetting system.\nNot a perfect system\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s no question that there are challenges to screening refugees from conflict zones like Syria. Intelligence and national security officials have noted the paucity of data.\nThe head of the National Counterterrorism Center told Congress in October 2015\u00a0that the intelligence in Syria is \"not as rich as we would like it to be,\" while FBI Director James Comey said there are \"gaps\" in data availability.\nThe use of fake documents and passports are also causes for concern, according to Jessica Vaughan of the \"low immigration, pro-immigrant\" Center for Immigration Studies.\nBut, again, this is not the same thing as \"no system to vet\" at all.\n\"No system is foolproof,\" said David Martin, a University of Virginia professor who\u2019s previously held posts at DHS and the State Department. \"If we really wanted a foolproof system, we would shut down immigration entirely.\"\n(This seems to be what Trump is advocating.)\nAccording to the State Department, Syrians tend to have more identity documents than other refugee groups around the world, and the reasons they give for missing documents \u2014 for example, a bomb dropping on their house \u2014 can be verified.\nAnd contrary to what Trump suggests, Clinton has spoken about stepping up the rigor of the vetting and proposed specific solutions.\n\"Congress needs to provide enough resources to ensure we have sufficient personnel deployed to run the most thorough possible process,\" she said in a December 2015 statement.\nFinally, we should note that refugees are subject to the highest level of security checks of any traveler category to the United States. So it \"makes no operational sense\" for ISIS to take advantage of the refugee program, Anne Speckhard, a counterterrorism expert at Georgetown University, told us previously.\n\"Given how easy it is to send a European extremist to the U.S. via Europe, why would an ISIS guy in Syria wait the three years it takes to get refugee status?\" Speckhard said.\nOur ruling\nTrump said there is \"no system to vet\" refugees from the Middle East.\nWhile there are concerns about information gaps, a system does exist and has existed since 1980. It involves multiple federal intelligence and security agencies as well as the United Nations. Refugee vetting typically takes one to two years and includes numerous rounds of security checks.\nWe rate Trump\u2019s claim False.\n Share the Facts   Politifact    5 7  Politifact Rating: False  There is \"no system to vet\" refugees from the Middle East.
