(The White House did not respond to an inquiry.)\nGerman car sales in the U.S.\nWe turned to data from the Center for Automotive Research, an Ann Arbor, Mich., think tank.\nIn 2017, the Center for Automotive Research found, BMW sold 354,110 cars in the United States, while Daimler sold 375,311, mostly Mercedes-Benzes. That\u2019s 729,000 vehicles -- not even one million, much less \"millions.\"\nVolkswagen, another German automaker that Trump didn\u2019t mention by name but which is also based in the European Union, sold 625,068 cars in the United States that year.\nAdding the three companies together, that works out to 1.35 million German cars sold in the United States last year.\nThat\u2019s not exactly \"millions,\" either -- but the problem with Trump\u2019s assertion runs deeper than that.\nWhat\u2019s an import?\nThe big three German automakers all have operations in the United States as well as overseas. So care needs to be taken to clarify where the German cars are made before they are labeled \"imports.\"\nBMW\u2019s largest assembly plant in the world is in Spartanburg, S.C., while Mercedes has a facility in Tuscaloosa County, Ala., and Volkswagen has a factory in Chattanooga, Tenn. Production levels for German cars in the United States have risen in recent years, with some of those cars sold in the United States and some exported overseas.\nWhen we inquired with Edmunds.com, an automotive website and analytical group, they sent us data showing that about 330,000 of the 1.35 million German cars sold in the United States in 2017 had been built here. That leaves about 980,000 German cars built elsewhere but sold in the United States.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo take one example, according to the Center for Automotive Research, BMW made 371,000 cars in the United States in 2017, exported 272,000 of these, sold the remaining 99,000 U.S.-built cars in the U.S. market, and imported roughly 255,000 cars for U.S. buyers in 2017.\n\"For sure, the raw number of imports are nowhere near \u2018millions,\u2019 \" said Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\nGerman carmakers didn't just ship cars from Germany, but also from Mexico, Slovakia, the United Kingdom, South Africa, Hungary, Spain, Brazil, Argentina, France and Italy, said Kristin Dziczek, vice president for industry, labor and economics at the Center for Automotive Research. A little less than half of German car imports to the United States actually came from Germany directly, she said.\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that even U.S. carmakers import cars into the United States. In fact, collectively, they import cars on a larger scale than the German companies do.\nSpecifically, Ford imported 100,000 cars into the United States on net, while General Motors imported 760,000 cars on net and Fiat-Chrysler imported 920,000 on net.\nFor the record, sales by the the three German carmakers are modest in the U.S. market, accounting for 8.5 percent of all sales in 2017, according to the Center for Automotive Research. By contrast, the Big Three U.S. automakers accounted for about 48 percent of U.S. sales that year.\nEconomic benefits of German carmakers in the United States\nMeanwhile, Trump\u2019s formulation also leaves out the economic benefits of having German automakers operating factories in the United States.\nCollectively, these plants employ an estimated 50,000 workers, and they have spillover effects on the local, regional and national economies.\n\"American workers are building some of the most popular vehicles with U.S. shoppers: SUVs,\" said Ivan Drury, senior manager of auto industry analysis with Edmunds.com. \"As more and more Americans opt to trade in their sedans for an SUV, the percentage of U.S.-built German vehicles on the road is on the rise.\"\nOur ruling\nTrump said, \"The European Union \u2026 they send us Mercedes, they send us -- by the millions -- the BMWs -- cars by the millions.\"\nTogether, Mercedes, BMW and Volkswagen imported less than a million cars into the United States in 2017, not \"millions.\"\nMore importantly, Trump ignores that a large proportion of German cars sold in the United States were also built here, using American workers and suppliers whose economic fortunes are boosted by Germany\u2019s carnakers. Other U.S.-built German cars were sold as exports.\nWe rate the statement False.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to PolitiFact's new daily email\n* indicates required\n\nEmail Address *\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Share the Facts 2018-07-02 16:45:15 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  \"The European Union \u2026 they send us Mercedes, they send us -- by the millions -- the BMWs -- cars by the millions.\"    Donald Trump President https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-foxconn-facility/   a speech in Wisconsin Thursday, June 28, 2018 2018-06-28    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01904"}
