Tell me how that helps anybody.\"\nYes, let\u2019s start with that premise. In fact, let\u2019s focus on it.\nIs Rhode Island among 10 U.S. states with the most stringent controls on guns?\nWe called Mattiello\u2019s spokesman and asked him to find out where the speaker\u2019s information came from. Meanwhile, we looked around on our own.\nIt didn\u2019t take long to find something known as the \"Gun Law State Scorecard.\" Maintained by the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, the scorecard ranks Rhode Island No. 9 based on the strength of its gun laws.\nWe found another ranking, also compiled in 2015, from the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, another organization that supports stronger gun laws. The campaign is named, in part, after the late Jim Brady, a White House press secretary who was shot and disabled when a Texas man attempted to assassinate President Ronald Reagan in 1981.\nOne of the Brady Campaign\u2019s web sites, CrimAdvisor.com, is a spoof on TripAdvisor.\n\"Plan your perfect getaway,\" it says, on a web page that identifies the 10 most attractive states for getting a gun. Rhode Island is listed among the 10 least gun-friendly states with a ranking of No. 8.\nThe law center, which was Mattiello\u2019s primary source, was established in San Francisco after a 1993 shooting that killed eight and wounded six.\nThe shooting, which took place at a law firm, led Bay area lawyers to create an organization that campaigned for a federal ban on assault weapons. Later, it focused on supporting state and local gun regulation in California. \n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Cicilline\n\n\nstated on October 19, 2010 in a campaign radio advertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Says \"John Loughlin voted to let people accused of domestic violence keep their guns.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Cynthia Needham \u2022 October 24, 2010\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2015, the center worked on a variety of projects to support stronger gun laws across the country. \u00a0\nAnd each year, the center analyzes state gun laws and grades each state on the \"strength\" of its regulations.\nStrength isn\u2019t always the same thing as strictness, \u00a0but it\u2019s fair to say there are more gun restrictions in states that get the best grades.\nIn 2015, Rhode Island\u2019s grade of B+ gave it a ranking of No. 9 on the scorecard, just behind Illinois and just ahead of Delaware.\nA spokesman for the law center, Garrett McDonough, told us that he wouldn\u2019t have used the word \"strictest,\" but the center\u2019s data does support Mattiello\u2019s statement.\n\"Our position would be that that statement is accurate,\" he said.\n\"We don\u2019t like to use the word strict because it makes it sound like it\u2019s a prohibition or a restriction of people\u2019s rights,\" he said.\nOther studies show that Rhode Island competes well in other statistics valued by supporters of gun control. One of them, the per capita rate for gun deaths, is low. \nAlso, by a per capita measure, incidents of guns purchased in Rhode Island and then used in crimes out of state are low. \u00a0Rhode Island\u2019s per capita rate in this category was the sixth lowest in the country, according to a Washington Post analysis of gun trace data provided by the \u00a0Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.\nOur ruling\nThe Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence is an outspoken advocate for gun control laws. And its legal experts rate Rhode Island among states with the strongest gun-control laws.\nThe statement is True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05570"}
