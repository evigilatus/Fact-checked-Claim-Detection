Tony Evers signed into law, a single line noted Evers also vetoed an obscure Republican-sponsored schools bill.\nA veto is not that surprising, given that the governor and Republican-led Legislature have been at loggerheads over just about everything since Evers took office. And the bill and veto failed to garner any media attention.\nEvers, who spent almost a decade as state schools superintendent, objected to how the bill addressed student records in his Nov. 21, 2019,\u00a0veto message.\n\"Under this bill, the name of a pupil\u2019s parents or guardians would be added to the list of categories that a public school must designate as directory data,\" Evers wrote. \"I am vetoing this bill in its entirety because I object to implementing a mandate that will negatively impact the privacy of parents of students in Wisconsin.\"\nIn other words, he\u2019s arguing the bill would require public release of parent names.\nThere\u2019s just one problem: The bill didn\u2019t do that.\nWhat the bill changed\nThe bill in question originated with state Rep. Mark Born, R-Beaver Dam.\nAccording to Born\u2019s staff, while attending a task force meeting with school administrators in Dodge County, the lawmaker learned of a 2018 situation where police were called to a student\u2019s home for a potentially suicidal parent. Police contacted the school trying to ensure the student wouldn\u2019t be dropped off by a bus during the incident, but district officials said they weren\u2019t allowed to release information on which student was related to the parent in question.\nUnder current state law, districts can designate specific \"directory data\" that is releasable to the public. These are the categories: a pupil's name, address, telephone listing, date and place of birth, major field of study, participation in officially recognized activities and sports, weight and height (for those on a sports team), dates of attendance, photographs, degrees and awards received and the name of the school most recently attended.\nThat list doesn\u2019t include the name of the students\u2019 parent or guardian.\nSo Born proposed a bill, later passed by the Republican Assembly and Senate, that added \"the name of the pupil\u2019s parents or guardians\" to the preceding list.\nThe bill did not affect the way directory data is used or released \u2014 just what is included in the data set.\nPut this next part in the wonky-but-significant category.\nEvers vs. reality\nState statute does not require any of the directory data be released, giving two groups power to limit it.\nThe school district decides which of those categories it will designate as directory data for that district.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Steineke\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembly Republicans \u201chave come to the table\u201d and were part of \u201cgive and take\u201d compromise on a coronavirus bill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParents and guardians then have up to two weeks after the district decision to decide if they want information about their student to be publicly available, or if they must approve any release in advance.\u00a0\nA Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction handbook on student records references this as well, saying, \"The district may choose some, none or all of the data as directory data.\"\nNothing matches the mandate claimed by Evers in his veto message.\nThe lead sponsors of the bill blasted Evers in a news release after the veto came down.\n\"His lack of understanding of the legislation is quite apparent, and it makes us question whether or not he\u2019s even reading the bills that his staff puts in front of him,\" Born said.\nWhat makes Evers\u2019\u00a0veto message especially unusual is that it starts out by describing the parental opt-out accurately: \"Under current law, directory data may be disclosed to any person if the public school notifies parents or guardians of the information designated as directory data, provides information on how to opt out of disclosures, and provides sufficient time to use the opt-out procedure.\"\nBut the next two sentences then refer to the bill as mandating this information be released.\n\"The Governor must have forgotten about that between his opening paragraph explaining the ability to do so and his conclusion where he used it as an excuse to veto it,\" state Sen. Luther Olsen, R-Ripon and the lead Senate sponsor, said in the news release.\nEleven days after the veto and callouts from Republican legislators, Evers\u2019 office on Dec. 2, 2019, shared an \"errata\" with PolitiFact Wisconsin that retracted the two references to a mandate. It was dated Nov. 29, 2019, but as of Dec. 3, 2019, had not yet been published among the press releases on Evers\u2019 website that announced the original veto\u00a0or with the official legislative bill history.\nEvers spokeswoman Melissa Baldauff said Evers\u2019 legal team looked into the matter and issued the errata as a result of the inquiry by PolitiFact Wisconsin.\n\"We used an errata here for the same reason that the courts do: to correct an error so that there isn\u2019t any confusion regarding the meaning or intent of the document,\" Baldauff said in an email. \"It is a process frequently used to correct legal documents after publication. The Wisconsin Court of Appeals, in particular, frequently issues erratas.\"\nBaldauff declined to detail how the mistake occurred but said Evers and his staff read the law, and \"the intent of his veto is not changed by the errata.\"\nOur ruling\nWhile vetoing a pupil records law, Evers said the law would have mandated that schools release the names of students\u2019 parents or guardians. He stated that the mandate was his main reason for vetoing the measure.\nBut there is no mandate \u2014 something Evers\u2019 office eventually admitted 11 days later.\nState statute is clear that the district can choose which student information is released, and even after that parents or guardians can choose to opt out of releasing any student information.\nIt\u2019s an admittedly obscure, in-the-weeds kind of law, but it takes on a larger significance since the governor \u2014 or a staffer working on his behalf \u2014\u00a0 either fundamentally misunderstood how the law works or intentionally misstated it to support his veto.\nWe rate Evers\u2019\u00a0claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16647"}
