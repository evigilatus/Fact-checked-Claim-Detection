The tax is already prohibited in Oregon, with the exception of Washington County, but advocates want to make sure the state doesn\u2019t implement a tax or allow local governments to impose one.\n\nThe reasons put forth by the Oregon Association of Realtors basically boil down to this: Home prices are down, property taxes are high enough, and you don\u2019t want another tax that would make it harder to buy or sell a home. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe group also plants a bug of fear in tax haters with this: \"Politicians have considered the idea of charging or allowing multiple layers of transfer taxes each and every legislative session for the last decade, and in fact one of the state\u2019s largest governments made charging this tax one of their top priorities just this year.\" (our emphasis)\n\nObviously, we wanted to know which large government made charging this tax a priority. Who was it and what happened? (Was it the tax-happy city of Portland?) We contacted the Realtors\u2019 association and received a response from Jon Coney, spokesman for the Yes on 79 campaign, previously known as Protect Oregon Homes.\n\nIt turns out the campaign was indeed talking about the city of Portland. As evidence that this large government body had \"made charging this tax\" a top priority this year, Coney shared a draft of the 2012 Legislative Agenda for the city of Portland. An agenda!\n\nWe got a copy of the final agenda. One of seven items on it was to \"strongly oppose any legislation that would preempt the City\u2019s authority and support legislation that proposes to lift preemptions.\"\n\nPreemption, for those who don\u2019t know, is when a superior government body regulates in a given area and pretty much trumps a lesser government\u2019s ability to do the same. The state trumps cities, and the feds trump states.\n\nCities and counties generally dislike preemption, because it usually ties their ability to raise revenue, also known as taxes and fees. Two particularly vexing subject areas -- taxing cigarettes and alcohol, and levying real estate transfer fees -- are indeed specified as examples in the city\u2019s 2012 legislative agenda. That\u2019s all accurate.\n\nBut we asked Coney how supporting flexibility to be able to maybe one day pass a real estate transfer tax -- along with higher alcohol and cigarette taxes, if you follow the group\u2019s reasoning -- is the same as making the imposition of such a tax a top priority this year? He said he didn\u2019t want to get into a fight over semantics, but one leads to the other.\n\n\"It\u2019s pretty clear for us, in 2012, putting this on their legislative agenda clearly is a strong signal that they want to pursue this taxing mechanism,\" Coney said.\n\nAre the two acts one and the same? He said, \"It is our position that asking that the (prohibition) be lifted is essentially leading to the institution of the real estate tax.\"\n\nSo this is the evidence the campaign provides for making the claim that the city of Portland made charging this tax a top priority this year: A legislative agenda in which the tax is given as an example among several examples on one issue out of seven. And by the way, legislation wasn\u2019t even drafted. And the Realtors know this.\n\nMaybe we missed talk of a real estate transfer tax somewhere? At a city council meeting at some point? Nope, the campaign can provide no other evidence. They can, however, point to previous legislative attempts, which got nowhere.\n\n\"I don\u2019t remember it being raised,\" said Nick Fish, the city commissioner in charge of housing. \"It\u2019s been on a laundry list of preemptions we object to on principle. Other than this campaign brought by Realtors, I don\u2019t even remember a conversation about the real property tax in the last year or two.\"\n\nWe asked Martha Pellegrino, lead lobbyist for the city of Portland, if the city would go ahead with a transfer tax if the prohibition were lifted. The answer is no, she said: \"Just because the state repeals a preemption of local authority does not mean that the City, or any other local government, would automatically act.\"\n\nWe\u2019re certain some of you don\u2019t care what Pellegrino or Fish -- or any other government official says -- they will or won\u2019t do. And it\u2019s absolutely accurate to say that Portland officials could levy a tax on every transfer of property as soon as the pesky state prohibition is gone.\n\nBut the only evidence the campaign provides is a legislative agenda for a short legislative session in which no legislation was drafted. How does that translate into making \"charging this tax one of their top priorities just this year?\" It doesn\u2019t. And that makes the statement both inaccurate and ridiculous.\n\nWe rate the claim Pants on Fire.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the 2017 tax law, \u201cpeople who make under $75,000 will have their taxes raised in 2021 and every 2 years after that until 2027.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 February 5, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10317"}
