The article makes it look like the Twitter account that tweeted the statement was Jackson (title: @SamulLJackson). This article was referred to as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It is true that Jackson is on Twitter, and @SamulLJackson is his verified account. The personal image on the account is also the picture that appears on Facebook. Recently, he tweeted about the next Avengers and published a commercial. But after the Twitter search, we couldn't find the supposed tweet that was posted on Facebook. We didn't find any tweeting to mention music and teachers either. One user made it look like she was retweeting Jackson using his handle and RT, meaning retweet, but did not contain a link to the original tweet. (She can easily tweet: \"RT@realDonaldTromp, perhaps if we pay less than these modern singers and teachers who are overpaid, there will be smarter people in the future and less - music.\") On February 2, 2021, Facebook wrote in the form of Joe Paiden \"Really removed\" student loan debts.

Although it is reasonable that he could tweet and then delete the statement, it is unlikely that such a statement would have escaped public scrutiny. We didn't find any news coverage indicating that Jackson shared this view, or that he tweeted and then deleted it. (In contrast, in 2018, Jackson was shot because of a legitimate tweet written by some who criticized him as homophobic.) Last summer, one of the users on Cora's website tried to solve the enigma of the quote, but it appeared empty when he asked for any sources or links. Another user said: \"This was a fake article on Twitter.\" The online search for quotes and Jackson appeared a lot of articles, but nothing reliable enough for us to support this claim on Facebook. In the absence of evidence, we value this wrong mail. Sharing the facts 2019-04-02 15:28:03 UTC Politic Fact 2 1 7 Politic Facting: falish Samilo L.
