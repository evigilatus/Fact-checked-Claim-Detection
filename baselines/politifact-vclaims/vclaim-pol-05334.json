Barbara Mikulski. Only a handful of the candidates have functioning websites, and we could only find two candidates \u00a0\u2014\u00a0Mark McNicholas\u00a0and\u00a0Chrysovalantis Kefalas\u00a0\u00a0\u2014 who even addressed the vacancy issue.\nIt\u2019s a similar case in Colorado, with 12 Republicans vying to take on incumbent Sen. Michael Bennet. Candidates there are all over the map, including some like state Sen. Tim Neville who have taken a similarly neutral or otherwise vague position.\n\"As far as the schedule is concerned, the U.S. Senate is going to have the final say on who gets approved,\" he said to the\u00a0Aurora Sentinel. \"So whether it happens now or after the next election, the Republican Senate majority needs to stand strong and only confirm a nominee that will stand firm in defense of the Constitution.\"\nDuf Sundheim, a California Republican running a long-shot Senate bid,\u00a0issued a similarly vague statement.\n\"Whether they approve or reject a nominee is a decision that should be made by each senator,\" he said. \"But they should do so with the highest level of veracity and honor.\"\nIn total, we found at least 15 candidates who issued vague statements not specifically spelling out what they believe the Senate should do regarding the court vacancy, and many more who didn\u2019t announce any position on their website or social media accounts.\nIt\u2019s fair to point out that many of the listed candidates are, to put it generously, running grassroots campaigns with little money and little hope of ending up in office. Zukowski issued a backtracking statement to PolitiFact saying, \"All serious GOP Senate candidates have made it clear where they stand on the GOP's refusal to do its job.\"\nBut the party is wrong in saying that the entire field of Republican Senate candidates have announced a clear stance on the issue, and in declaring that Heck stands alone in taking a guarded position on the vacancy.\nOur ruling\nThe Nevada Democratic Party says that \"every Republican Senate candidate\" has announced their position on the Supreme Court vacancy, except for Heck.\nOur research shows that\u2019s not the case. There are more than a dozen candidates, at least, who issued similarly neutral statements, and even more who haven\u2019t addressed the issue at all.\nWe rate the\u00a0claim as False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05334"}
