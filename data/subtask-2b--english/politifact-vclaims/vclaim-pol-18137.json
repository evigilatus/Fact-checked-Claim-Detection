The source: \"my aunt\u2019s friend\" who works for the government.\nThere is no evidence of this.\nThe message, which a reader sent us a screenshot of on March 16, appears in a group chat on iMessage. The sender claims to have information from \"my aunt's friend\" who works for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and \"just got out of a meeting with Trump.\"\n\"He\u2019s announcing tomorrow that the U.S. is going into quarantine for the next 14 days,\" the message reads. \"Meaning everyone needs to stay in their homes/where they are.\"\nWe\u2019ve seen screenshots of similar messages circulating on WhatsApp, a private messaging app that\u2019s popular abroad. Misinformation tends to get passed around via chain messages during major news events, so we looked into this one.\n\n(Screenshots)\nThere is no evidence that the federal government is set to announce a nationwide lockdown like the ones seen in France, Italy and Spain. President Donald Trump and the National Security Council have both refuted the claim.\nSo far, officials have advised Americans to practice \"social distancing,\" or avoiding crowded public spaces.\nIn a press conference March 16, Trump outlined several recommendations to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Among them is avoiding gatherings of 10 or more people.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 25, 2021 in a blog post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWHO now saying you do not need to wear a mask.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"My administration is recommending that all Americans, including the young and healthy, work to engage in schooling from home when possible, avoid gathering in groups of more than 10 people, avoid discretionary travel and avoid eating and drinking in bars, restaurants and public food courts,\" he said.\nIn response to a question, he said the administration is not considering a national curfew or quarantine. He reiterated that point in another press conference March 17.\n\"It\u2019s a very big step. It\u2019s something we talk about, but we haven\u2019t decided to do that,\" he said.\nRELATED: 7 ways to avoid misinformation during the coronavirus pandemic\nOne of the places where officials have ordered a lockdown is New Rochelle, N.Y., where Gov. Andrew Cuomo ordered a one-mile containment zone on March 10. Large gathering spots were closed for 14 days and National Guard troops are delivering food to people.\nIn the San Francisco Bay Area, local officials on March 16 announced sweeping measures to try to contain the coronavirus. Residents of six counties have been ordered to \"shelter in place\" in their homes and stay away from others as much as possible for the next three weeks. The move falls short of a total lockdown.\nAt the federal level, the CDC does have the power to quarantine people who may have come in contact with someone infected by the coronavirus, but most quarantines are done voluntarily. And decisions are usually left up to states and localities.\nWe reached out to the CDC for comment on the chain message, but we haven\u2019t heard back.\nThe chain message is inaccurate. We rate it False.\nIf you receive a chain message that you want us to fact-check, send a screenshot to [email\u00a0protected].", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18137"}
