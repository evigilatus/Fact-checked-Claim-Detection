The accusation, which is again circulating on social media, is fabricated and based on another soda company\u2019s patriotic promotion 19 years ago.\n\"So no one forgets,\" reads a Sept. 23 Facebook post. \"Don\u2019t buy the new Pepsi can coming out with pics of the Empire State building and the Pledge of Allegiance on them. Pepsi left out 2 little words in the pledge \u2018Under God.\u2019 Pepsi said they didn't want to offend anyone. So if we don't buy them, they won't be offended when they don't receive our money with the words \u2018In God We Trust\u2019 on it.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe claims in the post are false and have been around since 2002.\nPepsi has never released a can that featured the Empire State Building and/or a truncated excerpt from the Pledge of Allegiance. These inaccurate claims against Pepsi appeared after Dr Pepper unveiled a can in November 2001\u2014 in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks \u2014 that featured an image of the Statue of Liberty and the words, \"One Nation \u2026 Indivisible.\"\nAt the time, Dr Pepper was owned by Cadbury Schweppes PLC not PepsiCo, Inc., which owned Pepsi. Pepsi and Dr Pepper were separate companies 2001 and remain separate today.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt one point, Pepsi released a statement titled, \"False rumor alert: patriotic cans,\" according to Snopes.com.\n\"You\u2019ve received an erroneous email about a \"patriotic can\" that Pepsi allegedly produced with an edited version of America\u2019s Pledge of Allegiance. The truth is, Pepsi never produced such a can,\" the statement said. \"A patriotic package used in 2001 by Dr Pepper (which is not a part of PepsiCo) was inappropriately linked to Pepsi.\"\nCadbury Schweppes also issued a statement noting that its patriotic Dr Pepper can in fact left out most of the 31 total words in the pledge:\u00a0\n\"The special packaging was designed to reflect our pride in this country's determination to stand together as one. The Statue of Liberty and Pledge of Allegiance were chosen as two of the greatest symbols of American freedom. Only three words were used from the Pledge of Allegiance. Those three words were in concert with the patriotic mood of the nation.\"\u00a0\nThe limited edition patriotic can was retired in February 2002 and would not be used again, the statement said.\nThe design that sparked outrage was from a Dr Pepper can, not a Pepsi can as the post claims. There is also no evidence Pepsi intends to release a can design featuring a portion of the Pledge of Allegiance or the Empire State Building.\nWe rate this claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19035"}
