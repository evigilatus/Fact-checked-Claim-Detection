John Kasich says climate change is a problem.", "truth_label": "true", "date": "stated on August 28, 2012 in a billboard message:", "title": "Convention billboard touts John Kasich's view of climate change to GOP delegates", "text": "Republican devotees who have traveled to Tampa, Fla. for their party\u2019s national convention expect a week filled with activities aimed at unifying the GOP around the central policy and agenda messages as they nominate former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney for president.\n\nBut as thousands of out-of-towners arrived and made their trek to the Tampa Bay Times Forum, the arena hosting the convention, they have been greeted by some well-placed advertisements featuring some prominent conservative leaders -- including Ohio Gov. John Kasich -- that are not quite in lock-step with the message Republicans have long touted.\n\nKasich is prominently featured on a billboard outside the arena and on one at the most central interstate highway crossing in the city, as well as, on some placards adorning 40 city taxi cabs proclaiming his belief that global warming is real.\n\n\"I am a believer \u2013 my goodness I am a Republican \u2013 I happen to believe there is a problem with climate change,\" reads a quote attributed to Kasich that appears next to a picture of the smiling Ohio governor.\n\nBut wait, Kasich is still as staunch a conservative as ever, isn\u2019t he? PolitiFact Ohio decided to check if the ad accurately reflects the governor\u2019s position.\n\nThe billboard was sponsored by the Florida Wildlife Federation, a private membership group with about 60,000 members who are hunters, fishermen and outdoorsmen with a keen interest in environmental issues. It told PolitiFact Ohio it partnered with the Evangelical Environmental Network, a Washington lobbying group, to place the advertisements.\n\nThe Federation\u2019s policy consultant, Jay Liles, said his group is desperate to get politicians to view climate change as a life-changing issue and not a partisan issue. They have skin in this game. And there it is true that some Republicans have staked out a position doubting that climate change is really a factor.\n\nIn addition to Kasich, the federation also has sponsored similar ads with similar messages from similarly conservative leaders, such as, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former President George W. Bush.\n\nWe checked with Kasich\u2019s staff to see whether the quote was accurate. Rob Nichols, the governor\u2019s spokesman, confirmed that it was taken from a speech Kasich made in May 2012 at a small energy conference in Columbus, Ohio, that was sponsored by The Hill, a Capitol Hill media organization.\n\n\"What they have on the billboard is accurate,\" Nichols said, adding that Kasich has uttered similar comments four or five times during various private speeches, some of which were before Republican gatherings.\n\u00a0\nBut for context, Nichols said there is a little more to Kasich thoughts on global warming.\n\u00a0\n\"He has said this several times but what is usually omitted is what is on the back-end of what he has said,\" Nichols said. \"Each time he says it he has added, \u2018How big is this? I don\u2019t know. Should we overreact to this? No.\u2019\"\n\u00a0\nIn fact, The Hill published an article on May 2, 2012, about Kasich\u2019s speech at the energy conference. The quote on the billboard came from that story, according to the Evangelical Environmental Network.\n\u00a0\nThe full quote is: \"I am a believer \u2013 my goodness I am a Republican \u2013 I happen to believe there is a problem with climate change. I don\u2019t want to overreact to it, I can\u2019t measure it all, but I respect the creation that the Lord has given us and I want to make sure we protect it.\"\n\u00a0\nLiles said the Federation was approached by the evangelical group and agreed to sponsor the Tampa advertisements to convince Republicans to stop viewing global warming through political lenses.\n\u00a0\n\"We believe at the core that people don\u2019t treat our environment as a right or left issue, it is an issue that affects all of us. It is an issue that affects our pocketbooks,\" Liles said.\n\u00a0\n\"Whether it is addressed more through market driven means or through proposed regulatory means,\" he said, \"we believe somewhere in the middle is a road forward and they need to stop making this a partisan issue.\"\n\u00a0\nAlexei Laushkin, of the Evangelical Environmental Network, which paid for the advertisements said his group intentionally sought out key conservative leaders to push this agenda.\n\u00a0\n\"We in the evangelical community are tired of the politics of the issue and wanted to highlight conservatives who agree with us on this issue,\" Laushkin.\n\u00a0\nFor the most part, Republicans have doused talk of global warming saying Democrats are pushing it to enforce more government regulations on the energy industry.\n\u00a0\nThe Hill article notes that the Environmental Protection Agency has already begun to try to regulate greenhouse gas emissions and proposed carbon dioxide standards for new power plants to help mitigate the suspected effects of global warming. And that many scientists have long concluded climate change is real. But some Republicans have challenged the proposed EPA standards and questioned scientists conclusions.\n\u00a0\n\"We\u2019re hoping at the end of the day it will be a bi-partisan issue, one party can\u2019t solve the issue so we want to highlight conservative leadership on this,\" said Laushkin.\n\u00a0\nLaushkin said he suspects that many Republican delegates who see the signs at the convention will be surprised.\n\nBut as far as the quote from Kasich, his own staff confirms its accuracy. As long as Kasich\u2019s comments aren\u2019t used as a scare tactic to get others to believe in climate change then the governor is OK with how he is being portrayed, Nichols said.\n\nAnd that\u2019s how the billboards convey the message. No scare tactics. Just Kasich saying he agrees climate change is a problem.\n\u00a0\nOn the Truth-O-Meter, the Florida Wildlife Federation\u2019s claim rates True. \u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10499"}
