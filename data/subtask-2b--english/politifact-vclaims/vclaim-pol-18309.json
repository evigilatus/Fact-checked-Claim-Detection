(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe United States has experienced more confirmed COVID-19 deaths than Canada. But when taking into account the larger population of the U.S., the gap is not nearly as large as the post claims.\nWhile experts say leadership is one factor affecting coronavirus mortality, other factors are in play as well.\nComparing the numbers\nThe raw numbers come from Our World in Data. That research organization is funded by philanthropists Bill and Melinda Gates and is led by Max Roser, director of the Oxford Martin Programme on Global Development at the University of Oxford.\nAs of May 9, the date of the post, the confirmed COVID-19 death toll was 4,569 for Canada and 77,180 for the U.S., or nearly 17 times as many.\nBut the United States has a much larger population. To account for that, Our World in Data also reports the number of COVID-19 deaths per million people as of May 9: 121.06 for Canada and 233.17 for the United States.\nSo adjusted for population, the U.S. death toll is not quite double Canada\u2019s.\nThe U.S. leads the world in overall COVID-19 deaths. On a per-capita basis, it fares better than some countries, but worse than others.\nThe U.S. is showing a lower number of deaths per capita than countries such as Spain and Italy. But despite claims by President Donald Trump, it has far more than Germany and many other countries, including Canada, South Korea, Iran, Russia, Poland and Switzerland.\nBut comparing numbers at a particular point in time \"can be very misleading in terms of conclusions \u2014 because trajectories over time and the levels at different points in time are very different,\" said health economist Peter Berman, director of the School of Population and Public Health at the University of British Columbia and adjunct professor in global health at Harvard University.\u00a0\n\"Canada and the U.S. are not too far apart today, but the U.S. was way higher than Canada some weeks ago,\" he said.\nDifferences in leadership\nThe post does not define what it means by \"leadership,\" but there are differences in the ways the two countries\u2019 governments responded to the outbreak.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 25, 2021 in a blog post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWHO now saying you do not need to wear a mask.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the federal level, Canada supported widespread testing early and the U.S. did not, said Joshua Michaud, associate director of global health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation. \"That has been one of the big weaknesses of the U.S. response. It took us a very long time to scale up testing in the United States.\n\"Provinces in Canada have generally coordinated well with the federal government on how to respond to the outbreak, whereas U.S. states have often taken their own paths and sometimes clashed with the federal government,\" said Michaud, a former infectious-disease epidemiologist. \"That has not helped the response in the United States, if you have that sort of tension.\"\nBerman said public-health officers in Canada are much more empowered legally, and medical care is largely under the same government authority as public health, so it is much easier to direct and coordinate a response.\u00a0\nCanada\u2019s politicians, he said, \"tended to cede the podium to the public-health scientists more and didn\u2019t undermine or question them, especially in public. In the U.S., political leaders disagreed with scientists often and publicly.\nWith the U.S. in an election cycle, Berman added, \"political opposition is looking for things to criticize, as is a politically polarized media. Also, the U.S. seems to me to be a more polarized society politically. All of this has different results in terms of coherence and coordination of policy response.\"\nNews reports have also looked at differences in leadership.\nAn analysis by the CBC, the Canadian broadcast network, said Trump gave mixed messages about social distancing, and one American study found that people in counties that voted predominantly for Trump in 2016 were less likely to perceive risk associated with coronavirus, seek information or practice physical distancing, the analysis noted. In contrast, according to the analysis, Canadian politicians were more consistent in their messaging, and tracking data collected by Google from smartphones suggested that Canadians practiced more physical distancing than Americans and began doing it earlier.\u00a0\nIn addition to citing Trump\u2019s mixed messaging, the CBC analysis said the U.S. death rate is higher because its largest city, New York, was struck early in the pandemic; and because a lack of health insurance is a problem in the U.S., especially among Americans more vulnerable to COVID-19, such as African Americans.\n\"Canada has universal health care, whereas many people in the United States do not have health insurance or easy access to care, Michaud said. And, he said, the U.S. has a \"fractured\" health care system, with government providers, health insurance companies and private practitioners \"competing for scarce resources.\"\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post claimed: \"It\u2019s not that there\u2019s a virus shield between Canada (4,500 deaths) and the U.S. (80,000 deaths). What exists, is a difference in leadership.\"\nThese numbers aren\u2019t directly comparable because the U.S. has a far larger population, so the post exaggerates the difference.\u00a0\nBut on a per-capita basis, the United States still has nearly twice as many COVID-19 deaths as Canada does.\u00a0\nExperts said differences in how political leadership responded to the disease are one factor in the disparity. But there are others, such as the virus\u2019 heavy impact on New York City; poor access to health insurance and health care among people more vulnerable to the coronavirus; and people\u2019s different responses to guidelines aimed at containing the virus.\nThe statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details.\nWe rate it Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18309"}
