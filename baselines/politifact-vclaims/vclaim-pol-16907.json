Kamala Harris, D-Calif., was shared in a group for \"center left pragmatic progressives\" called The 47ers. It was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

There is some preliminary evidence that the drugs could be effective in treating the coronavirus, but more rigorous tests have not been completed. There is currently no Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment for COVID-19.\nWe\u2019ve previously reported on alleged financial ties between the Trump administration and hydroxychloroquine manufacturers, so we wanted to look into this claim, too.\nTrump does have a small financial stake in a French company that makes hydroxychloroquine. But the implication of the post, that Trump could stand to profit from that stake, is misleading.\u00a0\nThe New York Times reported on April 6 that the president has a personal financial interest in Sanofi, a French company that makes hydroxychloroquine, through a mutual fund from a firm called Dodge & Cox. At 3.3%, Sanofi is the largest holding of the firm\u2019s International Stock Fund.\nBut Trump\u2019s stake in that fund is rather small.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMasks have negative impacts on 68% of children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jon Greenberg \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe president\u2019s latest financial disclosure form indicates that he holds shares in the mutual fund through three different family trusts. The value of each of those holdings is between $1,001 and $15,000, which would put Trump\u2019s stake in Sanofi at \"between about $100 and $1,500 in total,\" the Washington Post reported.\n\"That Sanofi investment would therefore constitute between 0.000003 and 0.00005 percent of Trump\u2019s net worth,\" the newspaper wrote. \"If you were worth $100,000, it would be like worrying about the nickel in your pocket.\"\nRELATED: Hydroxychloroquine and coronavirus: what you need to know\nLet\u2019s pretend that Trump\u2019s last financial disclosure form is up-to-date and that his total holdings in Sanofi are valued at $1,500 \u2014 the high end of the range.\nSince March 20, the day after the president first mentioned chloroquine during a press briefing, the company\u2019s stock value has increased by about 17.3%. That would mean the value of Trump\u2019s shares in Sanofi has increased by nearly $260.\nGiven the president\u2019s net worth, which Bloomberg estimates to be nearly $3 billion, $260 would be a comparatively small payoff for promoting the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19. Plus, it\u2019s uncertain whether Trump\u2019s remarks have affected Sanofi\u2019s stock value; the company has performed about as well as the broader stock market.\nLegally, experts say Trump\u2019s holdings in Sanofi don\u2019t constitute a conflict of interest.\nKathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University, said in an email that federal law prohibits executive branch officials from participating in matters in which they have a financial interest. But the law exempts diversified mutual funds like the Dodge & Cox International Stock Fund \u2014\u00a0and because he\u2019s the president, Trump isn\u2019t subject to the regulation anyway.\n\"When Congress amended the ethics laws in 1989, it exempted the president from the criminal financial conflict of interest statute. So the statute doesn\u2019t apply to Trump at all,\" Clark said. \"And even if this statute did apply to the president, the regulation\u2019s exemption would seem to apply here. So Trump\u2019s touting of this drug does not violate the criminal conflict of interest statute.\"\nTrump has a tiny stake in Sanofi through a mutual fund, but experts told us that Trump\u2019s holdings do not violate federal conflict of interest laws.
