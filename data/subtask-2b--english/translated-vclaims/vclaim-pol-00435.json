Under the bill, which has been signed into law, patients suffering from several other cases, including terminal cancer, autism and multiple insemination, will now be eligible to participate in the programme. During a debate in the Senate on the proposal, Donna Campbell, from R-New Braunfels, opposed the inclusion of post-traumatic stress disorder in the bill. The disorder was ultimately not included in the approved bill. \"A postmortem study was carried out until an ex post facto study was carried out, examining autopsies and drug levels, what drugs were in the blood of the ex-combatants who committed suicide, and 70 per cent had THC,\" Campbell said. We decided to take a look at Campbell's claim to see whether there was such a study and whether there was a connection between veterans and marijuana abuse and suicide. No signs of Campbell &apos; s study at Campbell &apos; s office were received on numerous requests for comments. We searched far and wide, but we didn't find a study with results that matched those described by Campbell. Several experts and defenders who contacted this article said that they were not aware of a study that reflected the results described by Campbell. Several studies examine the relationship between cannabis use and suicidal ideas. Other countries compared the record data on suicide-related deaths with the timing of the legalization of medical marijuana in the states where suicides occurred. Dr. Arbana Agrawal, Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Washington School of Medicine, who prepared a study on cannabis, suicidal ideas and behaviour, said that these types of studies had produced mixed results. In its study, which recruited identical twins, one of them used cannabis more frequently and the other, which he used lightly or never used, found that the twins who used cannabis were often more likely to report suicidal thoughts and depression. While the data indicate that the association has nothing to do with shared genes and the early environment, it does not necessarily mean that the effects of cannabis were the cause. It could have been another risk factor, such as shock. A study carried out by CDC scientists in 2016 using data from the National Drug Abuse and Health Survey found that the rate of suicidal thinking was nine times higher for veterans with drug problems than for those without it, most of which involved marijuana. However, the study noted that other factors, such as post-traumatic stress management, treatment of chronic war-related pain, or adaptation to civilian life, could confuse the relationship between the two. In one interview on January 31, 2021, John Kerry said that Hurricane Harvey \"more water fell in Houston in five days than he went over Niagara Falls in one year.\" Agrawal said that one reason is that suicide is a complex behavior with many aspects of meditation, to attempts (with or without a plan) to actual death. \"\"Seekers\" may have asked only about individuals who reported depression, even though suicidal ideas and behaviours are not limited to depression,\" said Agrawal. \"In completed suicide studies, little may be known about the history of substance abuse above the toxicology report.\" Research on the use of cannabis and veterans also lacks information specifically on the use of cannabis and suicide among veterans. In a study conducted by the Safe States Alliance, a national organization for the prevention of injuries and non-profit violence, in March 2018, data from the National System for Reporting Violent Deaths of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were used to analyse suicide deaths between veterans and the United States armed forces. The study of the group found that 9 percent of the victims had marijuana in their body. It does not indicate whether the victim has more than one substance in her system. Sharon Gilmarten, Deputy Director of the Safe States Alliance, said that she was not aware of statistics such as those cited by Campbell. She also warned against interpreting her organization &apos; s studies or other studies containing poison data as conclusively linking marijuana to suicide because of the nature of THC. \"It's not just like alcohol where you have some BAC (blood alcohol content), which is directly related to disability, and then goes away and you kind of go back to sobriety more or less,\" said Gilmartin. \"When you think about THC, it's a different relationship, potion and response, and it also has a different delay, so you stay in your blood for a long time after you're weak.\" There are also limitations on what these data can tell us, Agrawal, because of that long-standing statistical standard, said that \"relationship does not mean causality.\" \"while such studies show a correlation, it is difficult to know from the data at some point whether cannabis use is a causal factor,\" Agrawal said. \"Veterans are more likely to report cannabis abuse and are at risk of suicide. But this does not answer the question of the relationship between the two.\" For example, persons at risk of suicide may often use cannabis for self-treatment; persons who use cannabis more intensively may report more suicidal thoughts; or another factor may affect the use of cannabis and the risks of suicide, such as exposure to psychological trauma. Our judgement, Campbell, pointed out that cannabis played a role in suicide among veterans, claiming that a study showed that 70 percent of the veterans who committed suicide had an infection in the body. However, the study cited by Campbell does not seem to exist. There is some research on this subject, but experts questioned the validity of reaching a conclusion on the link between marijuana abuse and suicide in general - let alone among veterans.
