And at times, its event at the former Pabst brewery site in Milwaukee, brought out the whimsical side of the candidates. Mahlon Mitchell, a firefighter and firefighters union president, used his time for a closing argument to put on firefighter gear in under 60 seconds. And Tony Evers recited the Gettysburg Address and took a selfie with the crowd.\nBut the forum was serious, too, including when the host asked:\n\"What would you do to make college more affordable?\"\nEvers answered first. He noted that as part of his role as the state supreintendent of schools, he serves on the state Board of Regents, which governs the University of Wisconsin System. Then he attacked Republican Gov. Scott Walker, saying:\n\"Since Scott Walker has been our governor, we\u2019ve gone from 50 percent state funding for the (UW) system to 15 percent.\"\nThat would be a precipitous drop of 35 percentage points.\n\n\n\n\nAll our fact checks in the governor\u2019s race.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nWalker and the GOP-run Legislature did cut $250 million from the UW System in the 2015-\u201917 state budget. And Democrats have attacked Walker on education funding ahead of the Aug. 14, 2018 primary, as they compete to be the nominee running against the two-term incumbent in the Nov. 6, 2018 general election.\nBut in this case, the attack misses.\n\n\n\n\nLike us on Facebook.

Currently, its operating budget is about $6 billion per year, with about $1 billion \u2014 17 percent \u2014 coming from state funding.\nTo see whether that percentage has changed during Walker\u2019s tenure as governor, we turned to a state agency, the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. (Federal funding and tuition are the two other largest sources of funding, and there are others, as well.)\nHere is how much of the UW System operating budgets has come from state funding since the year before Walker took office as governor:\n\n\n\n\nFiscal year\n\n\nPercentage of UW System operating budget from state funding\n\n\n\n\n2010-\u201911\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Steineke\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembly Republicans \u201chave come to the table\u201d and were part of \u201cgive and take\u201d compromise on a coronavirus bill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21.1 percent\n\n\n\n\n2011-\u201912 (Walker\u2019s first year)\n\n\n17.9 percent\n\n\n\n\n2012-13\n\n\n19.2 percent\n\n\n\n\n2013-\u201914\n\n\n19.2 percent\n\n\n\n\n2014-\u201915\n\n\n19.3 percent\n\n\n\n\n2015-\u201916\n\n\n16.6 percent\n\n\n\n\n2016-\u201917\n\n\n16.8 percent\n\n\n\n\n2017-\u201918\n\n\n17.1 percent\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nSo, state funding of the UW System was nowhere near the 50 percent Evers claimed when Walker took office.
