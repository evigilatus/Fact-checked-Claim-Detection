That means we're third in the Midwest.\" We've mostly evaluated that right. The ranking between the 10 states was correct, but only if the raw number of jobs added was used instead of the most visible increase in the percentage. Well, now that summer turned to autumn, there's a new set of monthly job numbers, with August being the last available month. And a new announcement by Walker TV makes the same claim comparing the Western Central states over the past 12 months: \"The truth? Last year, Wisconsin ranked third in job growth in the Middle West.\" Is the arrangement still valid? No. The Declaration brought us back to the best source of federal employment data, the United States Bureau of Labour Statistics. Walker uses monthly data to compare it. This time, Wisconsin dropped a spot. Wisconsin ranks fourth out of 10, not third, both in the growth of crude jobs and in the percentage change from August 2013 to August 2014. In the new arrangement, based on preliminary figures from August, Wisconsin (growth of 1.2 per cent for the year) was located in North Dakota (No. One grade at the national level with a growth of 5.3 per cent), Indiana and Minnesota based on the percentage change. The same story about the increase in the number of raw jobs throughout the year: Wisconsin came in the fourth out of 10 states. This places the Wisconsin arrangement at the national level at 32. In the new ad, Walker reveals in the screen chart that he uses July to July numbers. But this text runs counter to his claim that \"last year\" Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" By Haley Bimeler: 26 January 2021, defending the new announcement, Walker's campaign said that July's data was final, revised estimates unlike August's initial data. But we note that Walker did not hesitate in the previous announcement of the campaign to use July's primary data and to use it to end the \"last\" period of a year when she showed that the third order was. \u266a Rounding up the appraisal Walker himself clearly knows better. \u266a On September 19, the Governor sent this tweet from his personal account after the new figures appeared: \"WI is the fourth in the Middle West to create jobs in the private sector and the growth rate in the private sector (CES BLS August 2013 - August 2014). His campaign, which repeatedly broadcast new television spots, had a lot of time to absorb the August Job Report (issued on 18 September 2014) before his new announcement was launched (issued on 8 October 2014). We have taken a similar faint look at the numerical maneuver of the Democratic Mary Burke campaign. In August, we estimated the validity of Burke's claim that Wisconsin was the \"dead last\" in the Midwest based on a three-year period that coincided with the first three years of Walker State. But when Burke issued a similar statement in September and wrapped it around the latest figures showing the decline, we assessed her false claim -- Walker's assessment highlighted in his new announcement. She reported accurate data - Wisconsin ranked last in the Midwest from March 2011 to March 2014. However, this period did not coincide with the beginning of Walker's reign. In its allegations, Burke uses quarterly job data, which are more reliable than monthly data but are significantly delayed. Note in this estimate: In the last 12 months of this measure, Wisconsin no longer ranks last in 10 states. :: 8 out of 10 states. In a new television commercial, Walker says \"The truth\" is that \"last year, Wisconsin ranked third in job growth in the Middle West.\" This is old news. The updated arrangement is the fourth, closer to the middle of the herd, something the Governor knew before his announcement was broadcast. We're assessing the allegation wrong.
