Also under Bush\u2019s plan, a family of four that earns $40,000 or less would pay no federal income taxes.\nWe wanted to look at Bush\u2019s comment about how much the wealthy pays in taxes. Does the top 1 percent pay nearly half the taxes in the country?\nIncome taxes vs. all federal taxes\nWe found that the accuracy of Bush\u2019s comment depends on what type of federal taxes we consider. (Our analysis won\u2019t cover state and local taxes, which vary across the country.)\nThe Tax Policy Center, home to widely quoted nonpartisan experts on taxes, calculated in June that the top 1 percent will have 16.5 percent of total income in 2015 and pay 43.6 percent\u00a0of\u00a0federal income taxes.\nSo Bush would have been very close to correct if he had specified income taxes, but instead he said \"all taxes.\"\nIf we consider all federal taxes, the proportion paid by the top 1 percent is less than what was cited by Bush: 27.9 percent. That calculation by the Tax Policy Center includes a slew of federal taxes that includes income, payroll, corporate, estate and excise taxes.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the 2017 tax law, \u201cpeople who make under $75,000 will have their taxes raised in 2021 and every 2 years after that until 2027.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It\u2019s the difference between all taxes and federal income taxes,\" said Mike Tanner, a tax expert at the libertarian Cato Institute. \"He didn\u2019t say federal income tax, but if he is talking about federal income tax he is right.\"\nIt\u2019s important to note that while both calculations show an overall progressive federal tax system -- meaning the more you earn, the more you pay -- certain types of taxes are regressive, including payroll and excise taxes. The top 1 percent pay just 5.5 percent of payroll taxes even though they earn about 16.5 percent of total income. In contrast, the middle quintile has 13.8 percent of total income but pay 15.8 percent of payroll taxes.\nWe found another calculation that shows slightly lower numbers than the Tax Policy Center for how much the wealthy pay in taxes. The Congressional Budget Office found that for 2011, the top 1 percent received 14.6 percent of before-tax income and paid 24 percent of all federal taxes and 35.4 percent of all individual income taxes. (The November 2014 report is the office\u2019s most recent one, but it looks at numbers that are a few years older than the Tax Policy Center report.)\nWe sent a spokesman for Bush\u2019s campaign a summary of our findings. Matt Gorman said that Bush was responding to questions about the progressivity about federal income tax brackets.\nThe student did talk about \"tax brackets\" and closing \"tax holes for rich people,\" but he didn\u2019t directly ask a question about \"federal income tax rates.\"\u00a0(Here is\u00a0PolitiFact\u2019s transcript of their exchange.)\nOur ruling\nBush said, \"the top 1 percent pay 45 percent of all taxes in the country.\"\nBush was answering a question about taxable income, the progressivity of our tax system and closing loopholes for the rich. So part of the question he faced related to income taxes. And part of his answer related to income taxes, because he talked about his own plan for income tax cuts.\nBut Bush could have been more specific in his reply. The 45 percent number applies to federal income taxes, not all taxes. Bush spoke generically about \"all taxes,\" so if we look at all federal taxes, the share for the top 1 percent was 27.9 percent.\nWe rate this claim Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05811"}
