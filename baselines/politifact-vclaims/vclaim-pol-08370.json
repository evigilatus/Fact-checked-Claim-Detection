Earlier this month, we gave a True rating to Obama\u2019s claim that \"for the first time in nearly two decades, we produce more oil here in the United States than we buy from the rest of the world.\"\nBut we hadn\u2019t fact-checked his claim that we generate \"more natural gas than anybody.\" So we\u2019ll check it here.\nWe turned to two widely used sources for energy data. One is the Statistical Review of World Energy, published by petroleum giant BP. The other is the website of the Energy Information Administration, an office of the U.S. Department of Energy.\nAccording to BP\u2019s data, United States natural gas production in 2012 was 619 million tons of oil equivalent, or 20.4 percent of the world. The only nation that came close to that was the Russian Federation, which produced 533 million tons of oil equivalent, or 17.6 percent of the world total.\nSo by this measurement, Obama was correct. And the Energy Information Administration data concurs that the United States was No. 1 in the world.\nAccording to EIA -- which has figures as recent as 2011 -- the gross natural gas production by the United States was 28.5 trillion cubic feet, or 19.7 percent of the world total. The figure for Russia was 23.7 trillion cubic feet, or 16.4 percent of the world total.\nThat said, there are still some issues to factor in.\nOne is that there\u2019s no guarantee that every country\u2019s data is reliable, since not every nation has put the same effort into researching the question -- or, if they have, they may not be interested in sharing accurate information with economic rivals. While it would seem less likely that Russia would undercount its production than overcount it, it can\u2019t be ruled out that, intentionally or unintentionally, the Russian figure for production is higher than these tables would suggest.\nThe second issue is whether it\u2019s justified for Obama to claim a share of the credit for the United States\u2019 burst of natural gas production.\nIt\u2019s nothing new that the United States is at or near the top in natural gas production internationally. According to BP\u2019s data, the United States and Russia have traded off the No. 1 and No. 2 spots in natural gas production ever since the data separated out the Russian Federation from the old Soviet Republics in 1985.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince 1985, the United States has outpaced the Russian Federation in 13 years: 1985, 1986, 1995, 1997 to 2002 and 2009 to 2012. During the same period, the Russian Federation outpaced the United States from 1987 to 1994, 1996 and 2003 to 2008.\nThe United States\u2019 lead over Russia has increased during Obama\u2019s tenure. The United States produced 12 percent more natural gas than Russia in 2009, but 16 percent more than Russia in 2012. A big reason is the expansion of natural gas extracted from shale, using advanced technologies known as fracking.\nIn some areas of the country, fracking has kicked off an economic boom, and measured by carbon emissions at the point of combustion, natural gas represents an improvement over oil or coal. But environmentalists argue that there are other downsides to fracking, from the risk of localized water contamination to higher carbon emissions when the entire drilling and transportation cycle is considered.\nWe won\u2019t referee this debate, but we will note that both advocates of drilling and environmentalists have criticized Obama, either for being too cautious about promoting natural gas development or being too eager to support it.\nWhen we looked at Obama\u2019s campaign promise to expedite oil and gas drilling from domestic shale formations, we rated it a Compromise, noting that the numbers can be framed in ways that can either support or weaken the case that Obama has sped up the process of developing oil and natural gas resources.\nObama did issue an executive order in 2012, titled, \"Supporting Safe and Responsible Development of Unconventional Domestic Natural Gas Resources\" that established an interagency working group to \"facilitate coordinated\" federal efforts on new types of natural gas extraction.\n\"While natural gas production is carried out by private firms, and states are the primary regulators of onshore oil and gas activities, the federal government has an important role to play by regulating oil and gas activities on public and Indian trust lands, encouraging greater use of natural gas in transportation, supporting research and development aimed at improving the safety of natural gas development and transportation activities, and setting sensible, cost-effective public health and environmental standards to implement federal law and augment state safeguards,\" the order said.\nAlan Krupnick, a senior fellow at Resources for the Future, a think tank that tracks energy policy, said that the administration at the very least \"has not interfered with the shale gas revolution, which I'd say is something. In my view, the Environmental Protection Agency has not been heavy-handed on environmental concerns\" relating to natural gas.\nStill, as the administration acknowledged, the advances in shale-based natural gas extraction largely developed due to the private sector. And given the long-term pattern, it\u2019s clear that natural gas production in the United States was already high before Obama took office.\n\"Obama's claim, implied or voiced, rings hollow,\" said Joel Darmstadter, a senior fellow at Resources for the Future. \"The shale gas fracking revolution, especially in its development phase, antedates Obama's presidency. And the bonanza it has created and the dramatic price declines it has spurred don't seem to me to be traceable to any of his administration's policies.\"\nOur ruling\nObama said, \"Thanks in part to our all-of-the-above strategy for American energy,\" the United States generates \"more natural gas than anybody.\"\nThe best available data suggests that he\u2019s right about the United States being No. 1 in the world in natural gas production, though it\u2019s more in dispute whether his administration deserves credit (or, in the eyes of some environmentalists, blame) for \"part\" of this development, as Obama put it. On balance, we rate his claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08370"}
