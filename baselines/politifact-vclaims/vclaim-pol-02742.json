Evidence of the need for NLP is illustrated by the passage of resolutions demanding changes in House leadership by 54 (and growing) of Republican party county chapters that together represent over 50 percent of Texas Republican voters.\"\nVoters might question whether party honchos automatically represent their wishes. Still, we wondered if resolutions demanding changes won widespread adoption as described.\nThe PAC's release didn\u2019t single out House leaders by name. But the PAC\u2019s treasurer, Don Dyer of Austin, responded to our request for factual backup by emailing an undated document listing 56 of the state\u2019s 254 counties under the headline, \"Texas County GOP\u2019s Voting to Oust Straus,\" the San Antonio Republican in his record-tying\u00a0fifth two-year stint as speaker. House members fill the gavel-wielding leadership post from among themselves at\u00a0the start of each regular legislative session.\nWe unsuccessfully sought more information from Dyer, who told us whoever composed the list didn\u2019t want to be identified. Dyer also didn\u2019t provide copies of the referenced resolutions or the details of each proclaimed action.\nIndependent verification\nWe started our independent look into this claim by asking\u00a0the Republican Party of Texas about such actions by local parties. By email, spokesman Jamie Bennett replied\u00a0that county parties \"act autonomously and are not required to submit resolutions to the state party. Therefore, I do have any list of all relevant resolutions. The best way to get that info would be to contact county chairs individually.\"\nWe didn\u2019t have the resources to check all the counties listed by Dyer. But our reporting--based on interviews of local party officials plus news stories and web posts by county parties and Empower Texans, a group long intent on banishing Straus for his resistance to its agenda--showed that anti-Straus resolutions were approved by executive committees of Republican parties in 19 counties including the eight counties accounting for the greatest numerical turnouts in the state\u2019s latest GOP primary, in March 2016: Harris, Tarrant, Dallas, Bexar, Collin, Denton, Montgomery and Travis counties.\nAlso, you can make a case that the 19 parties represent more than half the state\u2019s Republicans. That is, state-posted election returns show\u00a0the 1,498,383 people who voted for president in those counties\u00a0comprised 53 percent of the 2,836,488 Texans who voted for president in the party's statewide primary.\u00a0About 1.4 million Texans voted in the Texas Democratic presidential primary.\nCounty-by-county confirmations\nWe turned next to confirming individual adoptions of anti-Straus resolutions.\nIn July 2017, Bexar County Republicans led the way by\u00a0adopting a resolution by 36-28 calling for \"a change in leadership in the Texas House speakership.\" That happened, in Straus's home county,\u00a0just before lawmakers began a special session on 20 topics designated by Gov. Greg Abbott including Abbott\u2019s desire, successfully resisted by Straus, for a public-school bathroom law targeting transgender people.\nLike others, the Bexar County resolution says the House\u2019s leadership should change due to Straus\u2019s failure to support the party\u2019s platform. The\u00a0latest platform, adopted by Texas GOP activists in 2016, spells out positions that nominees are expected to champion--among them, an end to the direct election of U.S. senators; abolition of about 10 federal agencies; passage of federal legislation remanding all authority over abortion to individual states--and, at the state level, \"enactment of legislation addressing individuals\u2019 use of bathrooms, showers and locker rooms that correspond with their biologically determined sex.\"\nIn a phone message, Ruth Pharis of the Comal County Republican Party confirmed that its executive committee on July 20, 2017 approved a resolution supporting a change in the House speaker. Hood County Republicans similarly acted before the special session, according to a memo from Jim Logan, the county party\u2019s chairman. \"Even though many pieces of legislation have been put forward that are in line with the Republican Party of Texas platform,\" the resolution says, \"Speaker Straus has failed to get them through the Texas House... We have no confidence going forward that he will adequately support the direction outlined by the platform and new leadership needs to be installed to effectively represent the will of the Republican Party of Texas voters and their platform.\"\nGOP leaders in Smith County likewise approved a resolution, though the Tyler Morning Telegraph quoted Brent Thompson, the county party\u2019s chair, calling the move \"symbolic\" and saying the resolution \"isn\u2019t going to accomplish anything more than show Speaker Straus where we stand.\"\nAn August 2017 Empower Texans web post says Liberty County Republicans that month approved a \"no confidence\" resolution calling for Straus to be censured by the state party\u2019s executive committee for \"his dismal failure to support\" the party\u2019s \"core principles.\" The resolution also contains passages suggesting Straus bends to Democratic wishes. Straus, unsaid, gained momentum as an aspirant for House speaker in 2009\u00a0thanks to backing from House Democrats and a few Republican House members.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Aug. 7, 2017, Collin County Republicans voted 40-13 for a resolution in favor of House Republicans alone choosing the House speaker at the start of the 2019 regular session, Neal Katz, the county party\u2019s executive director, told us by phone.\nOn Aug. 17, 2017, the executive committee of the Denton County Republican Party approved a \"no confidence\" resolution demanding that \"our elected officials in the Texas House withdraw support\" from Straus. \"We believe that it is time for new leadership in the House in order to effectively represent the will of Texas voters,\" the resolution says.\nMontgomery County Republican Party leaders acted similarly by a 33-11 vote, according to an account in the Golden Hammer, a local publication. Wally Wilkerson, the county party\u2019s chairman, told us by phone the vote took place with most of the local party\u2019s 90 executive committee members not present. Wilkerson, who\u2019s chaired the local party since 1964, credited conservative activists. \"Core elements of both parties have to have a bogeyman,\" Wilkerson said.\nSeparately, Galveston County Republican Party leaders voted 14-2 to adopt a no-confidence resolution about Straus, Empower Texans reported\u00a0while\u00a0party leaders in Tom Green County adopted a resolution telling the county\u2019s House member to \"work to install\" a speaker who\u2019ll advance party platform directives, Jeff Betty, the county party\u2019s chairman, told us by email.\nAlso in August 2017, Republican precinct chairs in Hidalgo County voted in a straw poll by 20-0, with seven abstentions, to condemn Straus, according to a Rio Grande Guardian news story, though no resolution was taken up. The story quoted Jim Barnes, a tea-party activist, calling Straus an \"embedded Democrat.\"\nKaufman County Republicans approved a resolution calling for Straus to be removed as speaker for not heeding core platform principles, that party\u2019s chairman, Jimmy Weaver, confirmed by phone. In a phone message, Marty Rhymes of the Gregg County Republican Party said its leaders approved an anti-Straus resolution. \"We\u2019re definitely excited he\u2019s not going to run\" again, Rhymes said.\nAlso that month, Dallas County Republicans approved a resolution expressing \"no confidence\" in Straus, Ashley Moretti, the county party\u2019s executive director, confirmed by email.\nOn Sept. 25, 2017, the executive committee of the Harris County Republican Party approved--without a voiced dissent, party spokesman Vlad Davidiuk told us by phone--a resolution charging Straus with constantly obstructing the party\u2019s platform, \"resulting in a vast and deep disappointment among conservative grassroots voters.\" Also noted in the resolution: Straus referring in June 2017 to Abbott\u2019s special-session topics as \"horse manure.\"\nStraus, the resolution says, \"has consistently killed conservative legislation, advanced liberal bills and remains beholden to special interests. It is a demonstrable fact that Texas House Republicans will pass conservative bills if those bills ever get a \u2018floor\u2019 vote. The Speaker has consistently packed his committee chair assignments with Democrats and liberal Republicans in an effort to deliberately stall and kill conservative legislation,\" the resolution says.\nSeparately, Tarrant County Republicans adopted a call to choose a different speaker \"that will be fair and apply the rules equitably to all members of the House on all bills,\" the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported.\nAlso that month, Randall County Republican Party precinct leaders voted to tell local House members to vote against Straus for speaker, the Amarillo Globe News reported. And by a show of hands, precinct chairs for the Travis County Republican Party approved a resolution Sept. 12, 2017 calling for a change in the House speaker due to Straus\u2019s \"non-support\" of the party platform, the county party says on its website. The resolution said Straus had \"consistently denied the House the opportunity to act decisively upon conservative policies supported by Texas voters.\"\nOn Sept. 18, 2017, party leaders in Guadalupe County endorsed a resolution recommending that Straus be censured by the state party\u2019s executive committee \"for his dismal failure to support\" the platform\u2019s \"core principles,\" Karen Hale of the county party told us by email.\nIn Williamson County, in contrast, party leaders rejected an anti-Straus resolution by 31-14, the party\u2019s chairman, Bill Fairbrother, advised by phone. Fairbrother recalled debate about whether the move would hurt the county among lawmakers. Fairbrother said of Straus, \"There\u2019s a lot of respect for him here.\"\nWe queried Jason Embry, a Straus spokesman, about the PAC's claim. Embry replied with an email expressing Straus\u2019s gratitude for support from \"mainstream Republicans.\" The email didn\u2019t touch on resolutions adopted by leaders of county parties.\nOur ruling\nThe PAC said county parties representing more than half the state\u2019s Republican voters approved resolutions demanding changes in House leadership.\nThe group fell short of proving its claim. But we identified 19 counties, arguably accounting for more than half the voters in the state\u2019s 2016 Republican presidential primary, where local party leaders approved calls this year for Speaker Straus to go.\nWe rate this claim True.\n\nTRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate and there\u2019s nothing significant missing.
