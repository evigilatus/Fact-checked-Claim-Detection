In 2013, they raised 140 million bucks, gave $9 million to people in direct aid.\"", "truth_label": "barely-true", "date": "stated on September 4, 2016 in a panel on Meet the Press:", "title": "Trump surrogate repeats wrong talking point on Clinton Foundation giving", "text": "Surrogates for Donald Trump continue to make the argument that the Clinton Foundation is a \"slush fund\" for Bill and Hillary Clinton, and they keep repeating an inaccurate talking point.\nWhile discussing on Meet the Press why Trump has yet to release his tax returns, Republican strategist Alex Castellanos turned the tables, saying that the nonprofit bearing Clinton\u2019s name doesn\u2019t do much except enrich her family.\n\"Because that idea that somehow the Clinton Foundation is this wonderful thing that helps people, most charities give 75 percent of their money in direct aid. The Clinton Foundation gives less than 10 (percent). In 2013, they raised 140 million bucks, gave 9 million to people in direct aid,\" Castellanos said.\nWe\u2019ve heard various versions of this claim (from former GOP presidential candidate Carly Fiorina, conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh and RNC chairman Reince Priebus). It\u2019s misleading.\nCastellanos\u2019 numbers don\u2019t take into account the bulk of the foundation's work. The foundation does spend a lot of money on charity, not through grantmaking, but through its own programming.\u00a0\nTax returns show the Clinton Foundation raised just under $143 million and spent about $85 million, including $9 million in grants to other organizations.\u00a0But that does not include all of the foundation's charitable work\n\"Grantmaking is not part of its mission, and that creates confusion \u2014 since many people imagine that foundations are engaged in giving away money,\" writes David Callahan, editor of Inside Philanthropy.\nDespite its name, the Clinton Foundation is not actually a private foundation (like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation or the Donald J. Trump Foundation) that solely gives to philanthropic causes. Rather, it\u2019s a public charity, like United Way or the Salvation Army, that runs its own in-house projects and hires staff to carry out the work.\nClinton Foundation programs include providing women in Peru with the tools and equipment to launch their own businesses, installing solar panels and grids in Haiti after the earthquake, helping farmers in Tanzania boost yields and turn a profit, and using market mechanisms to reduce the cost of HIV/AIDS medicine.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll together, these programs cost $68 million in 2013 (page 10 of the foundation\u2019s tax documents for that year), or about 80 percent of all of the foundation's expenses that year. In 2014, programs were 87 percent of the Clinton Foundation\u2019s expenses, according to Charity Navigator, giving it a score of 10 out of 10 on that metric.\nHere\u2019s a more detailed breakdown of the foundation\u2019s 2013 expenses:\n\nIn sum, Castellanos\u2019 claim is \"totally wrong,\" Callahan of Inside Philanthropy told PolitiFact. \"The vast majority of the money raised goes to support program work in the field, as anyone can tell from looking at the Clinton Foundation\u2019s annual finances.\"\nCastellanos did not respond to requests for comment.\nOur ruling\nCastellanos said, \"The Clinton Foundation gives less than 10\u00a0(percent in direct aid). In 2013, they raised 140 million bucks, gave $9 million to people in direct aid.\"\nCastellanos is cherry-picking one line-item that doesn't include all of the foundation's spending on charity.\u00a0While outside grantmaking made up about 10 percent of its expenses in 2013, the foundation spent about $68 million, or about 80 percent, on in-house charitable programs to help those in need.\nWe rate Castellanos\u2019 claim Mostly False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f2b4836b-114e-453b-a297-7ceb2b7159fe", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04369"}
