The article has since been posted by many other websites including Defense USA, Santa Christmas and Policetask.\nThe Feb. 2 story said that \"last week\" 31 of 42 men on the Jaguars took a knee during the national anthem. (The Jaguars\u2019 schedule shows their last game was Jan. 21, so technically they didn\u2019t play the week before Feb. 2.)\nThe players angered \"every God-fearing, country-loving American who has either had the honor to serve or know someone who did. They might as well have wiped their proverbial asses with the American flag,\" the story said.\nThe story said that the Jaguars were \"quietly maneuvering behind the scenes to file a Chapter 11 reorganization of debt bankruptcy in the 3rd District Court of Atlanta next week.\"\nWe found no such court in Atlanta, and we found there is a bankruptcy court much closer to home: the Florida Middle Bankruptcy Court in Jacksonville.\nWe searched news reports and found nothing about the Jaguars moving toward bankruptcy.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForbes valued the Jaguars at about $2 billion, in 25th place, in it\u2019s 2017 ranking of the value of NFL teams.\nThe controversy about football players\u2019 silent protests began in 2016, when then-NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick initially sat, and later switched to taking a knee, during the pre-game anthem to protest racial discrimination, especially at the hands of police.\nThose protests became even more politicized after President Donald Trump tweeted Sept. 23, 2017 that any such players who don\u2019t stand during the national anthem should be fired.\nThe next day, dozens of NFL players nationwide took a knee in protest, including some Jaguars players during their game in London.\nThe Jaguars drew particular attention because their owner, Shahid Khan, a Pakistan-born Muslim and only nonwhite NFL owner, publicly showed his support for the protests. Khan joined his team on the field and locked arms to show solidarity during the game.\n\"We have a lot of work to do and we can do it, but the comments made by the president make it harder,\" Khan said in a statement. \"That's why it was important for us, and personally for me, to show the world that even if we may differ at times, we can and should be united in the effort to become better as people and a nation.\"\nKhan had donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration but has also criticized Trump\u2019s attempt to ban immigrants from predominantly Muslim countries.\nWe emailed the Jaguars\u2019 public relations office and did not get a reply.\nThe protests by NFL players have fueled multiple fake news stories including that a flight crew took a knee and stranded the New Orleans Saints on an airport runway, and that the NFL fined Pittsburgh Steelers $1 million each for skipping national anthem and that Fox Sports cancelled NFL broadcasts.\nAll of those stories rated Pants on Fire, and in this case the claim that the Jaguars declared bankruptcy over \"kneeling thugs\" is also made up.\nWe rate this story posted by various bloggers Pants on Fire!\n\u00a0\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/069e78af-af7f-4515-8032-b2ac804584b2", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02430"}
