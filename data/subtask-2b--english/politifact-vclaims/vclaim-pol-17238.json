DHHS says those deaths include people who have had a positive molecular or antigen test for COVID-19, who died without fully recovering from COVID-19, and who had no alternative cause of death identified.\u00a0\nThe deaths are reported by hospitals and clinicians directly to the local and state health departments.\nThe first reported COVID-19 death did, indeed, occur on March 12.\u00a0\nNC flu deaths\nThe state\u2019s health department also tracks flu deaths and reports each flu season\u2019s data on its website. Flu deaths are reported by health providers and were confirmed as influenza by an appropriate laboratory or rapid diagnostic test.\nPolitiFact reviewed the last 10 flu seasons, dating back to the 2010-2011 season. In total, we counted 1,486 reported flu deaths. DHHS spokeswoman Kelly Haight confirmed to us by phone that our total is accurate.\nHere\u2019s a list of the flu death counts by season, and a link to the report for each respective season:\n2019-2020: 186\n2018-2019: 203\n2017-2018: 391\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2016-2017: 218\n2015-2016: 59\n2014-2015: 218\n2013-2014: 107\n2012-2013: 59\n2011-2012: 9\n2010-2011: 36\nOther flu counts\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also tracks flu deaths by state. At a glance, it might seem like the CDC and North Carolina reports contradict one other. For instance, the CDC reported North Carolina had 2,064 flu deaths in 2018, while the state\u2019s health department reported far less.\nThat\u2019s because the CDC sometimes combines flu and pneumonia deaths together, officials said.\nUnder the \"flu & pneumonia\" section on the CDC\u2019s flu deaths by state website, \"most of those deaths are pneumonia deaths,\" said Jeff Lancashire, acting associate director for communications for the CDC\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics.\nSome pneumonia deaths are caused by the flu, but some can be caused by \"many other viruses, bacteria, bacteria-like organisms and fungi,\" said Kelly Haight, DHHS spokeswoman.\nThe year 2018 is the most recent year of flu deaths available on the CDC site.\u00a0\nIf you start in 2018 and look back 10 years to 1999, Lancashire said \"there were 1,806 deaths from exclusively flu alone \u2013 without pneumonia (from the public database CDC WONDER \u2013 wonder.cdc.gov).\"\u00a0\u00a0\n\"So if Dr. Cohen was citing deaths from flu alone, she would be correct that COVID19 deaths have exceeded that (number) in NC,\" he said.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe CDC has noted, however, that tallying death counts for COVID-19, flu and pneumonia is complicated and sometimes its data can be incomplete.\nOur ruling\nCohen said COVID-19 has killed more North Carolinians in a year than the flu has in the last 10 years.\nBy the North Carolina health department\u2019s count, there have been 5,200 COVID-19 deaths this year and 1,486 flu deaths over the last decade.\nCohen\u2019s claim also tracks with data collected by the CDC, according to an agency spokesman. However, the CDC points out that exact numbers can be tricky to count because there are sometimes delays in processing death information.\nWe rate her statement True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17238"}
