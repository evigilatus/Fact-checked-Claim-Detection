He urged Sessions to establish federal banking rules for the cannabis industry. The letter was signed by state treasures from Oregon, Illinois and Pennsylvania, as well as several cannabis industry representatives.\nMarijuana remains illegal, in all forms, under federal law.\nIn January, Sessions rescinded an Obama administration memo that recommended a hands-off approach to marijuana prosecution in states that have legalized pot. The move was seen as possibly paving the way for a federal crackdown on marijuana users and suppliers, though it\u2019s uncertain whether that will happen.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent types of marijuana sit on display at Harborside marijuana dispensary, Monday, Jan. 1, 2018, in Oakland, Calif.

(AP Photo/Mathew Sumner)\nTo support the statement that \"a majority\" of Americans live in states that have legalized cannabis, a spokesman for Chiang pointed us to a November 2017 report by the treasurer\u2019s office. It includes a map based on information from the National Conference of State Legislatures showing 44 states have some form of legal marijuana, ranging from adult recreational use to medical use to \"limited medical\" use in several states allowing \"cannabis extracts.\" \u00a0\nBased on that map, the vast majority of Americans do live in states that have decided to legalize cannabis.\nBut it\u2019s also the broadest collection of states we found and stretches the case on whether a state has really legalized any form of marijuana.\nWe decided to limit our count to states where voters or a state legislature has approved a comprehensive law authorizing medical or recreational marijuana.\nWe found 29 states, plus Washington D.C., that meet that criteria, based on news reports. Nine have legalized recreational marijuana while the rest have legalized medical marijuana. \u00a0\n\nMarijuana Laws\nInfogram\nEven with this smaller group of states, however, Chiang\u2019s statement holds up. There are more than 207 million people in these states, based on our review of census data.\nThat\u2019s easily a majority of America\u2019s 325 million people.\nOur ruling \nCalifornia Treasurer John Chiang recently claimed: \"A majority of Americans now live in states where they have decided to legalize cannabis.\"\nHis office pointed to a report that shows 44 states have some form of legal marijuana, though that list includes some states with only \"limited medical marijuana\" legalization and no comprehensive law authorizing the use.\nIn reality, 29 states, plus Washington D.C., have passed laws authorizing recreational marijuana, medical marijuana or both.\nBut even with this smaller group, Chiang\u2019s statement is correct. That\u2019s because more than 200 million Americans live in these states, representing a clear majority of the country\u2019s 325 million people.\nWe rate Chiang\u2019s statement True.\n\nTRUE\u00a0\u2013 The statement is accurate and there\u2019s nothing significant missing.\nClick here for\u00a0more\u00a0on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.\n Share the Facts 2018-04-20 01:20:59 UTC   PolitiFact    6 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: True  \"A majority of Americans now live in states where they have decided to legalize cannabis,\" including recreational and medical marijuana.
