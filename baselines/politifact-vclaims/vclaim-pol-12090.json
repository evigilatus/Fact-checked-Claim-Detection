Rick Perry, who is seeking the GOP presidential nomination.\n\nPerry\u2019s plan would allow people to opt out of the current tax system and pay a flat 20 percent federal levy on their income.\n\nDuring a Fox News interview on Oct. 30, the governor did not dispute host Chris Wallace\u2019s assertion that the flat tax proposal, by the estimates of Perry\u2019s campaign, would reduce federal revenue by $4.7 trillion from 2014 to 2020. \"I think Americans are ready for Washington, D.C., to quit spending money,\" Perry said.\n\nThe next day, Kaine\u2019s campaign put out a statement saying Allen supports a 17 percent flat tax -- lower than Perry\u2019s 20 percent.\n\n\"That means Allen\u2019s plan would actually shrink revenues further than the Perry plan, forcing even harsher cuts to programs that Virginians depend on,\" the news release said.\n\nWe wondered if Kaine was correct in saying Allen backs a flat tax plan that would cut revenues more than Perry\u2019s proposal.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the Texas governor\u2019s plan, flat tax filers would receive a $12,500 exemption for each dependent and would not pay levies on capital gains and social security benefits. Perry\u2019s proposal would preserve deductions on mortgage interest and charitable contributions, as well as state and local taxes, but phases them out for people with incomes of more than $500,000. He would also drop the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent.\n\nFlat tax supporters say the lower levies would fuel economic expansion; critics say the plans would sap more revenues than can be made up by added growth. An analysis of Perry\u2019s plan by economic consultants John Dunham and Associates, done at the behest of the Perry campaign, said it could drain about $5 trillion in federal revenues through 2020.\n\nWhat, exactly, is Allen proposing? We\u2019re not sure, and Allen\u2019s campaign isn\u2019t providing many clues.\n\nKaine, in the news release, based his contention that Allen backs a 17 percent flat tax on a statement Allen made during a June 14, 2011, news conference when he released his economic platform. \u00a0Allen endorsed the concept of an optional flat tax.\n\nThere are a lot of people who would actually like to say, \"Alright, here is my income, multiply it by, say, .17, and file it on one page,\u2019\" he said.\n\nThe Kaine campaign provided us with transcripts and tapes of two other appearances where Allen used the 17 percent flat tax example. In both cases, Allen used the word \"say\" before he uttered 17 percent, creating some hedge room.\n\nDan Allen, an Allen policy adviser, said the candidate\u2019s wording shows he was throwing out a hypothetical number. A variety of flat tax plans throughout the years have called for flat tax rates of 17 to 25 percent, Dan Allen said.\n\nThe text of George Allen\u2019s economic proposals, titled \"The Blueprint for America\u2019s Comeback,\" calls for a flat-tax alternative but offers no details.\n\nWe asked Allen\u2019s campaign for specifics -- such as what percentage of income should be subject to a flat tax and what deductions and exemptions should be allowed. But Dan Allen said the Republican has never settled on a single flat tax plan to support.\n\n\"To say there\u2019s one Allen plan is not accurate,\" said Dan Allen, who is not related to George Allen.\n\nHe referred us to George Allen\u2019s 2010 book, \"What Washington can Learn from the World of Sports,\" in which the Republican said he\u2019s supported a variety of flat tax proposals. One plan lauded in Allen\u2019s book would establish an optional flat levy on combined federal payroll and income taxes, set at 25 percent of gross income.\n\nRoberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, said he suspects that proposal would drain more revenue than Perry\u2019s plan because it affects two levies. Perry\u2019s proposal only applies to income tax, not payroll tax.\n\nWilliams wrote earlier this month that Perry\u2019s proposal \"would dramatically reduce tax revenues,\" by a much as $1 trillion in 2015. But he told us he can\u2019t definitively say whether Allen would cut off more government revenue than Perry because he doesn\u2019t know the details of what Allen is proposing.\n\nOur ruling:\n\nKaine says Allen\u2019s flat tax \"plan would actually shrink revenues further\" than a flat tax proposal made by Texas Gov. Rick Perry.\n\nKaine is correct is in saying Perry endorses a 20 percent flat tax on income, but stretches the truth when he says Allen has made a proposal that would set the rate lower. Allen, while endorsing the concept of an optional flat tax, has offered no plan of his own. The basis of Kaine\u2019s charge are Allen\u2019s statements that a flat tax rate could be set at \"say, 17 percent.\"\n\nThat\u2019s hardly a plan or an endorsement of a flat tax rate, so there\u2019s no substance to compare to Perry\u2019s proposal. We don\u2019t fault Kaine for demanding specificity from Allen. But Kaine goes too far when he tries to create a plan for Allen based on inconclusive statements.\n\nWe rate Kaine\u2019s claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-12090"}
