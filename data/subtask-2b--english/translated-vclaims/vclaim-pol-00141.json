Trump, who called the booming displacement crisis in the state a shame, sent officials to Los Angeles last week to find ways to reduce the growing number of people living on the streets there. On Monday, Duckworth returned a tweet to the New York Times article on the Department's efforts, adding the following: \"Just a quick reminder that Trump and @HUDGov have already undermined the displacement crisis in our nation.\" Duckworth wrote, followed by a list of political actions allegedly taken by the Department, including reductions in affordable housing programmes, allowing shelters to reject people on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation, expelling legally-married migrant families from subsidized housing, and increasing rents for low-income individuals. Just a quick reminder that Trump and Hodgov have exacerbated the displacement crisis in our nation by: - developing affordable housing programmes - granting shelters to reject lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender immigrants + ppl-Evicing mixed-status immigrants from subsidized housing - Tripleing/ Rent Increase https://t.co/OqTictlhgO - Tami Dakworth (@SenDukworth) 16 September 2019 Trump has already proposed changes that correspond to what Duckworth described. Each of them has been widely criticized for the risk that some of the country &apos; s most vulnerable residents may have access to housing. However, no changes have yet been made in the policy he has proposed, and Congress is moving forward with a budget that does not include the sharp cuts in housing desired by the President. Trump - who argued that people living on the streets had destroyed the Los Angeles and San Francisco \"prestige\" - rejected calls from local officials for more funding to address the issue. He also said that the Environmental Protection Agency would issue an environmental notice against San Francisco to address the problem. After calling Duckworth's office for an explanation, she responded to her original tweet with another tweet within hours. She wrote that she \"should have said that they tried these four things,\" but Trump and his administration \"didn't succeed yet, despite repeated efforts.\" My previous tweet is inaccurate. I should have said they tried these four things, and that's right. Tammy Duckworth (@SenDukworth) 17 September 2019 still wants to set things right for those who have not seen the Duckworth correction and to provide some background information on the proposals I have mentioned. Here's the conclusion: Chris Kennedy stated on January 16, 2018 in an interview with the Chicago Sun Times that \"there was no need to put affordable housing in place.\" \u2022 On 6 February 2018, the Tramp budget for 2020 proposed substantial reductions for the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development that called for a reduction in funds for programmes that help low-income people gain access to housing. The proposal was widely described as not being in principle in Congress, where it was rejected by both parties among legislators. This summer, Congress approved a budget to allow higher levels of government spending with the support of Trump. The legislatures have not yet finished drafting the adoption laws, but the advocates with whom we spoke no longer expect housing cuts. The president's budget was rejected in the same way last year. After legislators indicated that they did not intend to approve the cuts proposed by Tramp, High Housing Minister Ben Carson retracted a plan in which he announced that April was aimed at increasing the rent of millions of beneficiaries of federal housing assistance. The proposed legislation calls for a threefold increase in rent paid by some of the poorest households in the country, with minimum rates rising from $50 to $150. Although it was presented when Republicans occupied a majority in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, legislators showed little interest in its advancement. Earlier this year, Trump also proposed changes to the federal rules to limit housing for the poor, in order to \"grant shelters to deny the use of LGBT persons\" and \"exorcise mixed migrants.\" Although it does not require congressional approval, the Department cannot light it without a lengthy review process that has not yet been completed. In May, the Department proposed the abolition of protection measures in the Obama era that prevent persons from being discriminated against because of their sexual orientation or gender identity in federally funded shelters for displaced persons. If approved, the Trump Plan can allow single-sex shelters to deny services to transgender people. Also in the spring of this year, the White House presented a plan to remove undocumented migrants and their families from public housing, which was determined by an analysis carried out under the HUD programme that it could lead to the displacement of more than 55,000 children residing or legal citizens in the United States. Current rules prevent undocumented migrants from receiving federal housing benefits unless their children or spouses are eligible. Local landowners and housing officials have expressed concern about the proposal, which may face legal challenges. Housing advocates oppose both proposals, along with the other Trump Plan, which they claim makes it more difficult to claim discrimination in housing in lawsuits under the Civil Right - The Right to Fair Housing Act. In the wake of the Trump news, we are thinking of suppressing homelessness in California, and Duckworth has claimed that the President and his Ministry of Housing \"impacted the displacement crisis in our nation\" by reducing affordable housing programmes, allowing shelters to refuse people on the basis of gender identity, expelling migrant families with legal status from subsidized housing and increasing rents on persons receiving federal housing assistance. The President &apos; s administration has issued a series of proposals in this regard. But Trump has not yet succeeded in making any of the changes that Duckworth described, a point that she publicly acknowledged after our investigation. We assess her claim mostly wrong.
