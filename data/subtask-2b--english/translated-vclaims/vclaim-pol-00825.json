J.P. Bretzker took the first step towards fulfilling a major promise of the election campaign by developing a plan to replace the fixed income tax in Illinois with a system of taxation at higher levels of income at higher rates. Bretzker wants legislators to put in place a measure in the 2020 ballot requesting voters to approve a constitutional amendment granting them the power to replace the fixed income tax in Illinois, which is currently set at 4.95 per cent for all taxpayers, regardless of their wealth, with a series of graduation rates. He states that the structure of the rate he proposes will generate billions of new revenues by increasing taxes on more than 3 per cent of countries, with modest cuts - or keeping the line for those who earn less. However, a business-related group is run by the former President of the Allianui Association of Overseas Manufacturers Greg Baez with a warning announcement from the children of Central Illinois to monitor their governors. A novelist says before arguing that Springfield politicians cannot be trusted after a tax hike in previous years. \"They are making a constitutional amendment to your 2020 ballot, paving the way for their employment tax on the middle class.\" The new Baez Group, Illinois ideas, clearly refers to the Bretzker plan for a progressive income tax. But everything else about the Declaration cannot be more ambiguous, so we decided to take a closer look. While there is no formal definition of \"job tax,\" it is clear that the Bretzker Plan does not contain one. The experts we talked to noticed that sometimes the term is commonly used to describe so-called head taxes, like a monthly fee of $4 per worker. But that's nothing like what Britzker's suggesting. Richard Okser, a co-researcher at the Centre for Urban Broken Tax Policy, said that \"it is totally incorrect\" to use the term \"work tax\" to refer to the progressive income tax proposal. \"The income tax isn't on people, it's on your income,\" he said. Ucker also rejected the argument of the Declaration that amending the Constitution to allow graduation rates would make permanent rates whatever the Britzker and state lawmakers ultimately decide to enact. \"There's nothing like increasing permanent taxes,\" he said. \"All you have to do is go back and change the law.\" Indeed, the Declaration itself confirms that fact when it refers to previous tax increases. Since its establishment in 1969, the individual income tax rate in Illinois has changed eight times, up, down and up again before reaching 3 per cent in 1990, and then rening to 5 per cent in 2011, down to 3.75 per cent in 2015 and back to 4.95 per cent in 2017. There are two parts of the Bretzker tax scheme, neither of which appears to raise taxes on the middle class. The first step involves the constitutional amendment, which, if approved, will allow Breitzker to request legislators to establish a new timetable for graduated tax rates that impose more taxes on the wealthy. Britzker has drawn up a plan for the new price list, which he says will reduce taxes to the vast majority of taxpayers in Illinois. Only those with incomes of more than $250,000 a year will pay more, as the Governor says. In 2017, under the Tax Act of 2017, \"taxes will be raised on people who earn less than $75,000 in 2021 and every two years thereafter until 2027.\" By Louis Jacobson on February 5, 2021, the Britzker's plan for rates can change completely if the amendment works. It is also possible for legislators to approve it as it is and then raise rates somewhere below the line. This is what the Declaration insinuates. But it is important to note that legislators can raise the fixed income tax rate now, so that Illinois's idea is straining them. This makes the unfortunate warnings of the Declaration unreasonable. We contacted Baze for clarification through several e-mail and phone calls, but he didn't respond. Nor have we answered the questions we put to Illinois's ideas, a project of a non-profit advocacy group called the Illinois Alliance of Jobs, Growth and Prosperity, long associated with Republican Mediator Ron Gedowitz, Ambassador Donald Trump of Belgium. We therefore asked tax experts to challenge the decoding of the core group message. \"I think what they're trying to say is that this increase in income tax will reduce the number of jobs in the state,\" said Carol Portman, president of the Union of Non-Party Taxpayers in Illinois. In fact, Baze published this case in a comment article in the Chicago Tribune published before Bretzker disclosed the details of his tax plan, arguing that raising income taxes above a certain level \"will accelerate the payment of job creators who are already struggling outside Illinois.\" However, Portman said that studies on the effects of different tax rates on job growth at the state level were incredibly mixed. \"You can find real and honest numbers to support just about any argument you want to make,\" I explained. \"It's so hard to isolate\" A report issued by the Centre for Tax Policy in 2015 noted with sadness that recent studies have found in a variety of ways that tax cuts \"increased, reduced, did not or did not have a clear effect on growth.\" The results of the Centre &apos; s own research indicate that neither the amount of revenue that the State imposes under taxation nor the extent to which its upper limit rates \"recognize any stable relationship\" with economic growth across states over time. In addition, the potential impact on job creators is not an argument that upsets the Declaration itself with excitement. Chris Mooney, an expert in government policy at the Institute of Government and Public Affairs of the University of Illinois, said that it was likely that this was caused by the demand for active and middle-class voters to avoid high taxes for the wealthy. Instead of going into detail, he explained that it could be more politically effective to rely on \"classical-immigrant fear\" techniques. \"She scares people and lets them think of the worst,\" said Munni. \"When indeterminate and give them mysterious tires of negativity, they can hurry to their negative place.\" Our ruling announcement by the Anti-Tax Organization \"Elino's Ideas\" claims that the Breitzker tax scheme calls for a constitutional change \"to allow permanent employment tax on middle-class families.\" But Bretzker proposes an income tax, which is exactly what her name means: income tax, not jobs. With regard to permanence, any initial rates established under the graduated tax could be revised upwards or downwards, just like the current flat rate, which has changed in both directions over the past decade. The only difference is that higher prices under fixed taxation strike all taxpayers, while under graduation tax they can be engineered to affect only the rich. We value this allegation wrong.
