Party leaders quickly amended it to restore language from 2008 about helping people \"make the most of their God-given potential.\"\nThe party\u2019s 2020 platform includes the same reference to \"God-given potential,\" but critics continue to cite the 2012 omission. One Facebook post says, \"Dems have removed any mention of \u2018God\u2019 from their Platform. Why are they getting support from any Christian?\"\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nWhen the 2012 platform was unveiled and did not include the word God, Democrats, under pressure from President Barack Obama, quickly changed it. The Washington Post reported at the time that a press secretary for the Democratic National Committee called it a \"faux controversy,\" referred to a section of the platform about faith and pointed out there were multiple uses of the words faith, religion, religious, church and clergy.\u00a0\nThe 2020 platform similarly includes references to faith and religion, including a section titled \"Supporting Faith and Service,\" that reads, \"Religious freedom is a core American value and a core value of the Democratic Party. Democrats will protect the rights of each American for the free exercise of his or her own religion. It will be the policy of the Democratic Administration to advocate for religious freedom throughout the world.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt also says, \"Democrats remain committed to ending poverty and enabling all Americans to live up to their God-given potential.\"\u00a0\nWe reached out to the Democratic National Committee for comment but did not receive a reply.\nOver time, the Democratic Party has reduced its use of the word God in its platform. In 2004, the platform included the phrase \"one nation under God,\" and also referred to \"God\u2019s children,\" \"eyes of God\" and \"God\u2019s gifts.\" In 2008, 2012, 2016 and 2020, the only references to God in the platform were to \"God-given potential.\" A search of the Republican Party platform turns up 16 mentions of the word \"God.\"\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post says that \"Dems have removed any mention of \u2018God\u2019 from their Platform.\" That\u2019s not true, as the party\u2019s 2020 platform includes a reference to \"God-given potential.\" It also makes numerous references to faith, including a section that outlines its intent to protect religious freedom and uphold \"separation of church and state enshrined in our Constitution.\"\nThe Democratic Party in 2012 introduced a platform that did not mention God, only to quickly re-insert the reference. The party\u2019s platforms in recent years have had fewer mentions of the word God than in the past.\nBut the assertion that the Democratic Party platform doesn\u2019t include a reference to God is wrong.
