Rick Scott\u2019s former health care company.\n\"Maybe you\u2019ve heard about what was the largest Medicare fraud in history, committed when Rick Scott was a CEO,\" the narrator says. \"Or that Scott\u2019s company paid record fraud fines of $1.7 billion dollars. And when Scott was deposed in lawsuits about his company, he took the Fifth 75 times. Meaning, 75 times, Scott refused to answer questions because \u2013 if he had \u2013 he might admit to committing a crime.\"\nThe ad launched June 17, 2014, and is airing in West Palm Beach and Orlando, as well as Tampa Bay, which is home turf for Democratic front runner Charlie Crist.\nEarlier this year, we fact-checked a similar claim by the Democrats about the $1.7 billion fine, rating it Mostly True. Here we will fact-check whether Scott took the Fifth Amendment 75 times. It\u2019s not a new topic, for Scott or for us. We fact-checked similar claims during Scott\u2019s first race in 2010.\nColumbia/HCA\nScott started Columbia in 1987 by purchasing two El Paso, Texas, hospitals. He quickly grew the company into one of the country\u2019s largest publicly traded hospital chains, and in 1994, merged Columbia with Tennessee-headquartered HCA and its 100 hospitals.\nIn early 1997, federal agents revealed they were investigating the Columbia/HCA chain for, among other things, Medicare and Medicaid fraud. Allegations included that Columbia/HCA billed Medicare and Medicaid for tests that were not necessary or ordered by physicians, and that the hospital chain would perform one type of medical test but bill the federal government for a more expensive test or procedure. Agents seized records from facilities across the country including in Florida.\nScott resigned in July 1997. Scott said he wanted to fight the federal government accusations, but the corporate board of Columbia/HCA wanted to settle. In 2000, the company pleaded guilty to at least 14 corporate felonies and agreed to pay $840 million in criminal fines and civil damages and penalties.\nThe government settled a second series of similar claims with Columbia/HCA in 2002 for an additional $881 million. The total for the two fines was $1.7 billion.\nScott\u2019s deposition\nScott gave a deposition in 2000 in which he invoked the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution 75 times. The amendment reads in part that no one \"shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\"\nBut that deposition was not part of the criminal fraud case being pursued by the federal government. In fact, Scott was never officially questioned during the federal criminal investigation.\nThe deposition was part of a civil case in which Nevada Communications Corp. alleged that Columbia/HCA breached the terms of a communications contract.\nScott gave the deposition at his offices in Stamford, Conn., on July 27, 2000, months before the settlement with the federal government. (The records of Scott\u2019s deposition were distributed to reporters by Scott\u2019s Republican primary opponent Bill McCollum in 2010.)\nThe deposition shows that Scott repeatedly refused to answer questions. Scott's lawyer first interjected after an opposing lawyer began the deposition by asking simply if Scott was employed.\n\"Under normal circumstances, Mr. Scott would be pleased to answer that question and other questions that you pose today,\" Scott's lawyer, Steven Steinbach, said. \"Unfortunately because of the pendency of a number of criminal investigations relating to Columbia around the country, he's going to follow my advice, out of prudence, to assert his constitutional privilege against giving testimony against himself.\"\nScott then went on to read the same answer, even when asked if Scott is a current or former employee of Columbia/HCA -- \"Upon advice of counsel, I respectfully decline to answer the questions by asserting my rights and privileges under the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 23, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBiden invested the entire family fortune in Ukraine gas and oil.

However, Scott\u2019s reason for invoking the Fifth Amendment was as a result of the criminal investigations, his lawyer said.\nWhat about other depositions?\nThe Democrats\u2019 ad makes a reference to multiple lawsuits: \"And when Scott was deposed in lawsuits about his company, he took the Fifth 75 times.\"\n\"The Nevada Communications Corp. case is the only lawsuit where Scott took the Fifth 75 times,\" Florida Democratic Party spokesman Joshua Karp told PolitiFact Florida. (The ad includes video footage of Scott from a 1995 case -- not the 2000 case which is the focus of the ad.)\nKarp pointed to a 2010 Miami Herald/Tampa Bay Times article which stated that Scott gave \"murky testimony\" in a series of depositions.\nAn example: In a 1997 deposition when he was asked about an apparent agreement he made with a Texas doctor, Scott said: \"I don't know what your definition or anybody's definition of an \u2018agreement\u2019 is, or an \u2018offer\u2019 is, or \u2018promise\u2019 is.''\nWhat he \u2018might\u2019 admit to if he had testified\nThe ad states that \"Scott refused to answer questions because, if he had, he might admit to committing a crime.\" We can\u2019t fact-check what Scott might or might not have admitted, but it\u2019s worth noting a few things about the Fifth Amendment.\nThe Fifth Amendment cannot be used in a criminal court to suggest guilt, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1956.\nIn a civil case, things get a little murkier, and judges or juries can infer what they want from \u00a0a person using the Fifth Amendment.\n\"The bottom line is that in a civil case, the judge and jury are free to draw the inference that 'a truthful answer to the questions that he was asked would incriminate him,' \" George R. Dekle, Sr., a professor of law at the University of Florida, told PolitiFact Florida in 2010. \"However, there can be myriads of reasons other than guilt which prompt a person to claim a Fifth Amendment privilege, and it might be just as reasonable to infer that the witness refused to answer for some other reason.\"\nScott\u2019s response\nDuring the Univision debate in October 2010, Scott was asked about the deposition:\n\"With regard to that deposition, that was years after I left HCA. It was just, you know, all the same trial lawyers that are supporting my opponent, they were doing a fishing expedition, and they sat there, you know, it was a case I knew nothing about, I was not involved, I was not a defendant. So to stop the fishing expedition I just didn't do it.\"\nAs for the case itself, Scott told the Tampa Bay Times in 2010, \"There's no question that mistakes were made and as CEO, I have to accept responsibility for those mistakes. I was focused on lowering costs and making the hospitals more efficient. I could have had more internal and external controls. I learned hard lessons, and I've taken that lesson and it's helped me become a better business person and a better leader.\"\nOur ruling\nThe Florida Democratic Party\u2019s TV ad states that when Rick Scott \"was deposed in lawsuits about his company, he took the Fifth 75 times.\"\nWe have two quibbles with the ad: the Democrats don't specify that the deposition was from a civil business case -- not the federal government\u2019s criminal fraud investigation into Columbia/HCA. However, Scott used the Fifth Amendment due to that federal investigation.\nAlso, the ad refers to multiple lawsuits -- Scott was deposed in separate lawsuits, but he took the Fifth Amendment 75 times in only one of them.\nWe rate this claim Mostly True.\n Share the Facts 2018-11-03 19:47:10 UTC   PolitiFact    5 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly True  When Rick Scott \"was deposed in lawsuits about his company, he took the Fifth 75 times.\"    Florida Democratic Party state political party    a TV ad Tuesday, June 17, 2014 2014-06-17    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07731"}
