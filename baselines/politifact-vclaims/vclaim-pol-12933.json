That\u2019s 130 buckets of cucumbers, $1 per bucket.\"\n\nUp to $18 an hour? That\u2019s more lucrative than flipping burgers or greeting customers at Walmart. Suddenly, picking cucumbers seemed like a viable Plan B.\n\nIf Black is right, farm labor could be a neat answer to Georgia\u2019s joblessness problems. Unemployment remains high at 9.9 percent. GA DOL \u00a0Farmers complain their immigrant labor force is leaving the state to avoid racial and ethnic profiling, harassment, or deportation they think will result from House Bill 87, Georgia\u2019s Arizona-style immigration crackdown.\n\nHB 87 requires that certain employers check their new workers\u2019 immigration status and gives law enforcement officers more leeway to check a suspect\u2019s immigration status. Gov. Nathan Deal signed the bill May 13, but it\u2019s being challenged in federal court.\n\nFarmers report they\u2019ve already lost thousands of dollars because they can\u2019t find enough laborers.\n\nBlack and others told us that field worker wages are often based on production. The more you harvest, the more money you get.\n\n\"They range from minimum wage to as high as $18,\" Black told PolitiFact Georgia. He cited instances where farmers told him solid workers could make even more.\n\nBut can job seekers reasonably expect to make $12 to $18 an hour?\n\nFirst, a note about harvesting jobs. A lot of them are temporary, and hours vary depending on Mother Nature. Laborers may have to work for 12 hours or more to pick a crop before it rots.\n\nReporters for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution interviewed workers and farmers who said pickers earned about $100 a day. One worker said she expected to work about 12 hours for that amount.\n\nThe most recent Georgia Department of Labor data date from the summer of 2010. The state tallied wage and employee numbers from farms with 10 or more employees who are covered by regular unemployment insurance. Such employers are required to report their numbers to the state.\n\nFor 13 weeks during July, August and September, 10,600 or so workers in Georgia were involved in \"crop production,\" or worked in farms, orchards, groves, greenhouses and nurseries that grow crops or plants. This group can include supervisors.\n\nThey made an average of $367 per week, the data show.\n\nPay varied depending on the crop. For instance, some 3,100 vegetable and melon workers made an average of $311 a week; about 1,000 blueberry and other non-strawberry crop workers made about $268; soybean crop workers (there were only 17) made about $666.\n\nThe state Department of Labor did not determine an average hourly wage, so we did our own rough calculation. Although field workers often work 12-hour days, we based our figures on a 40-hour workweek to be conservative.\n\nWe found that crop workers make about $9.18 an hour. Vegetable and melon workers were near $7.78.\u00a0 Blueberry workers made about $6.70 an hour. The soybean rate is $16.65, but that is for workers operating complex farm machinery, a relatively small number of workers.\n\nThese numbers were lower than Black\u2019s figures, so we turned to the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s farm labor data for additional verification. They calculate regional wage rates for \"field workers,\" or employees who plant, tend or harvest crops.\n\nWe looked at spring and summer wages for the Southeast, which includes Georgia, Alabama and South Carolina. Field workers made $8.86 per hour during the week of April 11 through 17, 2010. They made $9.12 an hour July 11 through 17, 2010.\n\nThe federal figures were also lower than Black\u2019s, so we consulted another source: former field worker Andrea Hinojosa, who opposes the immigration crackdown. She is director of Southeast Georgia Communities Project Inc., which provides health, education and other services to farm laborers.\n\nThe onion pickers Hinojosa serves generally make 38 cents for each bucket, she said. Fast, experienced workers can make $9.50 or $10 an hour.\n\nIt may be possible to make $12 an hour picking onions, Hinojosa said, but it\u2019s rare. $18 an hour is far-fetched.\n\n\"I\u2019ve got to tell you, I\u2019ve never seen, never heard of someone making $18 an hour,\" Hinojosa said. \u00a0\n\nIn sum, it is possible to make $12 to $18 an hour, as Black said, but those amounts are far higher than a typical wage. Information from state and federal agencies, the director of a farmworker aid group, and AJC reporters shows wages are closer to $10 an hour or less.\n\nBlack\u2019s statement is accurate on its face. Some farm workers \"can\" earn $12 to $18 an hour. Most, however, do not. His statement leaves out key details and takes things out of context.\n\nThis is our definition of Half True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-12933"}
