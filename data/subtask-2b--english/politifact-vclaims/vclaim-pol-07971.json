They are not living in poverty nor are they earning a wage that is responsible for sustaining a family.\"\nThat part of the statement caught our attention.\nAre typical minimum wage earners \"teenagers living with their parents in middle-class families\"?\nManley told us he relied on statistics published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and research by various think tanks on the living situations of young workers. We examined those and other information sources, and interviewed three economics researchers.\nThe age question\nIt\u2019s clear that teenagers make up a significant chunk of those whose wage tops out at the current federal minimum wage of $7.25.\nTeens (defined as those 16 to 19) made up 31 percent of the 1.5 million workers who were right at that wage in 2013.\nResearchers often include in their calculations workers whose hourly wage is less than the minimum. Examples are tipped employees such as restaurant workers, and salespeople under certain circumstances.\nUnder this approach, there are another 1.8 million minimum wage workers, bringing the total to 3.3 million, of which teenagers make up 24.1 percent.\nWe heard pros and cons about both methods. The official scorekeeper, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, presents both numbers and the total of 3.3 million.\nUnder the broader approach, teenagers are the second-largest category next to 20 to 24 year olds (26.2 percent).\nBut in the narrower method, teenagers are the largest category of the 12 age groupings the federal government uses to report the data for 16 and up (there are 111,000 minimum-wage workers 65 and older).\nManley says the plurality figure under the narrower approach backs up the group\u2019s claim that teenagers are the \"typical\" minimum-wage worker.\nHe even cited a definition (we found it in Dictionary.com) of \"typical\" that includes the phrase \"representative\" of a group.\nIn other dictionaries we consulted, \"typical\" is defined as a characteristic that is \"normal and expected\" (YourDictionary.com) or captures \"the overall sense of a thing\" (AllWords.com).\nSo, can \"typical\" be accurate if about 7 in 10 minimum-wage workers are not teenagers?\nManley cited research by James Sherk, a senior policy analyst in labor economics who researches minimum wage issues for the conservative Heritage Foundation.\nBut Sherk comes at it from a still different perspective -- a wider group of teenagers and young adults under 25.\nSherk told us \u00a0it would be accurate if the WMC had said that \u00a0\"teenagers or college students\" are typical. The combination of teenagers and college students and other young adults under 25, Sherk notes in his \u00a0research, accounts for just over 50 percent of minimum wage workers. Many work part-time.\nSherk defines minimum wage workers as those at or below the minimum.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Godlewski\n\n\nstated on January 9, 2021 in Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all women that lost jobs (in the December jobs report), it was mostly Black and Latina women. In fact, white women gained employment.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Nusaiba Mizan \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe also sought the view of Keith Hall, a former top White House economics adviser named by President George W. Bush as commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Like Sherk, Hall has warned against an increase in the minimum wage.\n\"Typical to my mind means over half,\" said Hall, now a senior fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. \"But that\u2019s just me,\" he added, saying the term might strike others differently.\nFinally, we asked David Cooper, an economic analyst at the liberal Economic Policy Institute, which is funded primarily by labor unions and foundations.\nCooper said the \"typical\" teenage claim struck him as false because the median age of workers right at the minimum wage is 23, and the average age is 29.8, according to his review of census data. In the context of the current debate over $10.10, the average age of workers who would benefit from that increase is 35, according to research by Cooper. Only 12 percent who would benefit are teenagers, that study showed.\nBottom line, there\u2019s some room to argue that teenagers are \"typical\" minimum wage workers, in that the group is by one measure the most-common category in reports breaking down the age of these employees.\nBut even researchers who are sympathetic with WMC\u2019s overall argument thought \"typical\" overshot the mark.\nLife with the parents\nThe WMC claim, of course, went further, saying that teenagers \"living with their parents in middle class families\" are the typical minimum wage earners.\nWe don\u2019t need research to know that there are teenage workers in such settings.\nBut quantifying how many of those teens living with parents are in \"middle class families\" proved elusive.\nOn this, WMC\u2019s Manley pointed us to the research by the Heritage Foundation.\nHeritage reported that \"minimum-wage workers under 25 are typically not their family\u2019s sole breadwinners. Rather, they tend to live in middle-class households that do not rely on their earnings.\"\nJust over 50 percent are not their family\u2019s sole earner, Sherk told us. As for the how many are in middle-class families, Sherk referred us to another organization\u2019s research, but it focused on minimum-wage workers aged 33 to 50, so it seems off point. And, as noted, the Heritage analysis itself is broader than just teenagers.\nOther voices say many live in less financially secure settings.\nCooper, at the Economic Policy Institute, did not have data on living arrangements, but said that 54 percent of all workers at the minimum wage live in households with total family incomes less than $40,000.\n\"It\u2019s going to depend on how you want to define \"middle class\" families, but clearly the majority of these workers are in relatively low-income families,\" Cooper told us.\nWe didn\u2019t find data directly on point to \"living with parents.\" But another research organization, the Employment Policies Institute, crunched census data in 2009 and found that 39 percent of workers helped by the move to $7.25 were living with parents or other relatives.\nHow many were teenagers?\n\"Unfortunately, I don\u2019t have great data on the how many of the \"living with parents/other family\" category are teenagers,\" Employment Policies Institute \u00a0research director Michael Saltsman told us. \"We know there\u2019s considerable overlap...\"\nThe institute, which has a website advocating against a wage increase, receives support from foundations, individuals and businesses including restaurants, Saltsman said. The New York Times reported that the nonprofit institute is run by a public relations firm that also represents the restaurant industry.\nOur rating\nWisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce stated that \"the typical minimum wage earners in America are teenagers living with their parents in middle class families.\"\nBy one definition of minimum-wage workers, teenagers make up the largest sub-group compared with other age groupings.\nBut teenagers are less than a third of minimum wage workers by any measure, and hard data is scarce on how many live in middle-class families.\nThree experts -- two sympathetic to stopping a wage increase -- thought the statistical reality fell short of making the teenage cohort \"typical\" of the minimum wage pool.\nWe rate the WMC claim Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07971"}
