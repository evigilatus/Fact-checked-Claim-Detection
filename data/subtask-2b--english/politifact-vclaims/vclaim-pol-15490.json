Taking a page from the same playbook, the House Republican Conference has created\n\na similar list\n\nfor the new health care bill that will be coming to the House floor in the next few weeks.\n\n\nYou can read\n\nour fact-check of the Republican analysis\n\nin its entirety. Here, we're looking only at the statement, \"Page 110 - Section 222(e) requires the use of federal dollars to fund abortions through the government-run health plan.\"\n\n\nWe should emphasize that the House bill has yet to be voted on, and Democratic leaders have said they might consider new language on how the bill handles abortion. The Senate is expected to consider its own bill with details that diverge somewhat from the House.\n\n\nThe latest version of the House bill incorporates an amendment proposed by Rep. Lois Capps, a Democrat from California. Her proposal sought to create a compromise on abortion, especially in regards to the public option, a basic insurance plan run by the government and offered as a choice on the health insurance exchange.\n\n\nThe public option could offer abortion services, but if it does, those services would be paid for with segregated patient premiums, not public subsidies. We looked at\n\nthe Capps amendment\n\nis some detail previously. We concluded that the Capps amendment would stop tax dollars from subsidizing abortion.\n\n\nThe sticking point in the new Republican claim, though, is the term \"federal dollars.\"\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

Our previous coverage has more detail on\n\nabortion and health care reform\n\n, and how it has been handled in the Senate.\n\n\nThe House Republican Conference said that health reform \"requires the use of federal dollars to fund abortions through the government-run health plan.\" We find this depends on how a person defines the somewhat vague term \"federal dollars.\" We rate the statement Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-15490"}
