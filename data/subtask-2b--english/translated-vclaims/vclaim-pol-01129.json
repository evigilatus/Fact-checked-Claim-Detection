He was Minister for Foreign Affairs and National Security Adviser and served under the chairmanship of two Presidents. It is also believed that \"Donald Trump is a phenomenon that foreign countries have never seen before,\" according to the Facebook publication of 16 September. \"Ex-Minister for Foreign Affairs Henry Kissinger gives us a new understanding of President Donald Trump's foreign policy and predicts its success,\" and he follows the article before Kissinger quotes again: \"The liberals and all those who prefer Hillary Clinton will never admit it. They'll never admit he's the only real leader. He does as much as he did not do before he did all of this nation's people. After eight years of tyranny, we finally see a difference.\" The article attributes more data to Kissinger, including: \"Trap puts America and its people first. That's why people love him, and that's why he's gonna be in charge for so long. There's nothing wrong with him and people need to open their eyes.\" \"Trump is the only true leader in world affairs and he's forced to change the politics that put America in the first place!\" It's later written. This article, in which more than 81,000 times participated, was referred to as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation in the broadcast of the news. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We contacted the Facebook account for more information on Kissinger's quotations but did not receive an immediate response. However, the supposed voices appeared elsewhere on the Internet. Facebook, mentioned on January 11, 2021 in Nancy Belusi's newspaper, is no longer the Speaker of the House of Representatives by Samantha Buterman on January 12, 2021. True, during an interview on December 18, 2016 in the face of the nation, Kissinger said that \"Donald Trump is a phenomenon that foreign countries have not seen. But Facebook releases come out of the text afterwards. \"It's a shocking experience for them that he came to office, at the same time, an extraordinary opportunity,\" said the host nation at that time - John Dickerson's face, according to the CBS version of the news. \"I believe he has the potential to fall in history as a very large president, because every country now has two things to consider. First, they thought that the former President or outgoing President had basically withdrawn America from international politics, so that they had to make their own assessment of their necessities, and secondly, here, the new President, who asked many unusual questions. Because of the combination of microspace and new questions, one can imagine something wonderful and new coming out of it. I'm not saying that. I'm saying it's an extraordinary opportunity.\" Kissinger did not call Trump the only true leader, or described Obama's presidency as \"eight years of tyranny.\" While speaking positively of the new President, he did not claim that \"there is nothing wrong with him and that people need to open their eyes.\" We value this wrong mail. Correction, January 17: The date of Henry Kissinger &apos; s interview with the nation was 18 December 2016.
