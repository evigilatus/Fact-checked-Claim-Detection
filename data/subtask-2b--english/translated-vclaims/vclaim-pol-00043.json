This allegation is the latest in the attacks by the Trump team against Hunter Biden, son of former Vice President Joe Biden, in 2020. In the face of an investigation into the isolation, the President has repeatedly accused, without evidence, that Sheikh Biden forced the main Ukrainian prosecutor to protect Hunter, who worked on the board of an Ukrainian company that was once the subject of an investigation. But while they accuse Hunter Biden of riding his family name into a fortune in Ukraine, Trump's children almost didn't stop their business deals abroad, as we found them. Several news outlets and government accountability groups have documented international business transactions conducted by Eric Trump and his brothers since Donald Trump took office. In some cases, Trump children themselves celebrated their activities abroad. Before his inauguration, Donald Trump announced that he would retain the ownership of Tramp, but that he would transfer day-to-day control to his eldest son, Eric and Donald Trump Jr. This step followed Trump's promise on Twitter following the elections, when he pledged that \"no new deals will take place during my term of office.\" This promise was elaborated in a white paper detailing the ethical rules that Tramp agreed to respect. According to the White Paper, Tramp will work like \"asset management company,\" seeking not to make new foreign transactions and donating all profits from foreign officials using Trump's property to the United States Treasury. (In February, China State stated that it delivered more than US$191,538 to cover foreign profits from 2018). But Trump continues to earn money from existing licensing and property transactions that have spread across more than 20 countries, according to the analysis of Tramp's foreign business interests from the Centre for Responsive Policy, a non-profit research group that tracks funds in politics. The Trump campaign referred to an article in the hill and directed our investigation to Tramp, which did not respond to multiple requests for comments. As stated by a number of news outlets, Tramp continued to operate abroad. Noah Bokpinder, Executive Director of Citizens Responsible for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said that he was a non-profit government observer following up on Trump's conflict of interest. \"Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. have traveled repeatedly internationally to run a business.\" In September, a local council in Scotland voted to allow the company to build 550 houses and a second golf course as an extension of a Trump-owned golf course in the region. Eric Trump described construction as a \"new stage of development\" in a celebratory tweet. Congratulations to our extraordinary team. A few minutes ago, we received full and complete approval for a new phase of development to include 500 homes, 50 huts, a sports centre, and more and more. We also received approval to build a second golf course! So proud of them! Pico.twitter.com/odVxomGdmf Bullgers verified the famous facts on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn appointing the Vice President.\" By Samantha Butterman (January 11, 2012) * Eric Trump@Erictromp (September 26, 2019), Trump recently obtained approval for the construction of 53 new houses and dance halls at the seaside golf course in Ireland, according to the Washington Post. In addition to the existing property management and licences, the Trump brothers built deals that were already in the works or were mobilized before Trump became president, and in some cases they returned and gave new life to old projects that had previously appeared abandoned. Anna Masoglia, a researcher at the Centre for Responsive Policy, said: \"Some foreign projects marked with tramp were announced only after the Trump elections and others expanded considerably.\" \"Projects that appeared to be forgotten long ago or inactive have also been reconsidered after the Trump elections.\" In 2017, for example, Eric Trump went to the Dominican Republic to revive a deal from 2007. Trump's lawyers then argued that the transaction had never ended, and therefore the new foreign transaction that the company promised to avoid was no longer the type of foreign transaction. But according to Associated Press, there are no new projects there that have been built or announced within a decade. In 2018, Donald Trump, Jr., travelled to sell apartments in highlands in India, where Tramp licensed five projects on pre-election deals. In 2017, the Wall Street Journal stated that the promotional material for one of these projects says that buyers could be associated with \"Celebrity and POTUS Donald Trump,\" a movement that Trump blamed a broker. In August, Trump Jr. travelled to Indonesia to promote two unbuilt Trump resorts. \u2219 Bookbinder noted that in an internal presentation, the Indonesian company that is building those properties said that the Trump International portfolio had an \"ongoing global aggressive expansion,\" with \"many projects under preparation.\" Similarly, Tramp participated in projects in Canada, the United Arab Emirates and Uruguay, and Scott Amy, General Adviser to the Government Supervision Project, a non-profit government oversight group. My mother referred to articles in Pol\u00edtico, the Daily Monster and Washington Post describing how protecting the secret service of the Trump brothers on their business trips cost taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars. \"Let's not forget that every year President Trump includes many international projects in his financial disclosure records,\" my mother said, adding that Eric Trump's claim was \"uncorrect.\" The brothers also sold many of Tramp's real estate properties, according to Forbes. In January 2018, they unloaded a $3.2 million plot of land in the Dominican Republic, a movement called Forbes, \"the most obvious violation of their father's pledge not to make new foreign deals.\" Ivanka Trump and Jared Kouchner Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kouchner, who have served as White House consultants, have benefited from foreign trade relations since Trump took office. Ivanka Trump kept her international fashion work for 18 months after her father's election. In the midst of trade talks with China last year, she received a number of brands from the country relating to a variety of her fashion products. She added more this year, too. \"Sure, applying for trademarks in an international country will be considered international business,\" said Jessica Tillman, Assistant Dean and Professor of Law at George Washington University Law School. Kochner is still partly the owner of his family's real estate company, but according to The New York Times, he has inventoryed some assets into a mother-controlled credit. Last year, his company entered into a nearly $1 billion rescue deal with Brookfield Asset Management, which is partly owned by the Government of Qatar, to save New York's failed property. The Governor, Eric Trump, said, \"When my father became the leader of this country, we came out of all international business.\" Trump said it would not make new foreign deals during Donald Trump's presidency. But the Trump brothers have travelled across the world, running property and taking action on transactions they say occurred or are under business before Trump took office. Regardless of whether these movements should be regarded as new foreign transactions, it is absurd to claim that the children of the Trump family stopped all international business after their father was elected.
