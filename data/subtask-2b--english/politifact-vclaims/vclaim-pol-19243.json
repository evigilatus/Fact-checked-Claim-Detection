It was scheduled to be the \"largest deployment of U.S.-based forces to Europe in more than 25 years with 20,000 soldiers deployed directly from the U.S. to Europe.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe exercise was meant to demonstrate the U.S.\u2019s commitment to NATO and \"to build strategic readiness by deploying a combat credible force to Europe\" according to the U.S. European Command.\nBy March, however, the Army announced that the exercise would be modified \"in size and scope\" because of growing concerns about the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus.\nAll movement of troops and equipment from the U.S. to Europe was stopped, the Army said in its press release.
