The Virginia Democratic Party says his claim is false. The strong Chairman of the Appropriations Committee of the Budget Writing Board, Jones, airs a 30-second announcement that he presents as a pharmacist. \"Chris Jones opened Bennett Pharmacy in Creek, and provided good and affordable health care.\" \"That's why he led the battle to expand Medicaid and improve our mental health system.\" The ad turns into L.D. Britt, surgeon and professor at the School of Medicine in Eastern Virginia. \"Chris Jones - for expansion, this is the main achievement,\" says. \"Chris Jones beat Midcaid to 400,000 Virgins.\" On August 20, the State Democratic Party denounced Jones' announcement as \"an eager attempt to mislead its voters.\" The Democrats said that Jones had spent years \"fighting teeth and nails to deny thousands of people in his society access to affordable health care.\" So we checked Jones' claims that he led the battle for expansion and found that its accuracy varied according to the year. Jones was a man of compromise between the two parties in 2018, which allowed Medicaid to cover more than 400,000 more low-income Virgins. However, his announcement does not say that from 2013 to 2017, he played a leading role in blocking it. The roles played by Jones and other legislators in the expansion of Medicaid can be a major issue this autumn when all 140 seats of the General Assembly are on the ballot papers. :: Democrats must turn one seat in the Senate and two seats in the House of Representatives to control the two houses for the first time since 1999. ................................................................................................................. The redrawing of the maps ordered by the Court by six Republican members - including Jones and Speaker Kirk Cox of the Colony Heights - has been placed in newly formed provinces with the majority of democratic voters. The old Jones District, elected 11 times, was 56% Republicans, 44% Democratic, according to Virginia's non-partisan public access project. His new area is 43% red and 57% blue. Jones is being challenged by Clint Jenkins, a real estate broker and a local democratic activist. Let's take a closer look at Jones' record of Medicaid expansion, starting from the early years. Jones, 2013-2017, offered states the option of extending their medical aid programmes to households earning up to 138 per cent of the poverty line, effective 1 January 2014. The Affordable Care Act - or Obama's Care Program - promised the federal government to pay all the costs of expansion initially, not less than 90 per cent. Republican leaders - including the outgoing government. Bob McDonnell and Speaker Bill Howell announced their opposition in early 2013, saying that they did not trust the federal pledge to collect most of the costs of expansion and that Virginia's program was too inefficient to allow growth. The cost of State medical assistance has increased over the past decade by an average of 9 per cent annually, according to the Joint Subcommittee on Health and Human Resources. Jones was in a team of budget negotiators that year, which established a committee to create efficiency in the Virginia programme that might open the door to future expansion. The Democrat Terry Makulev became governor in 2014 and made the expansion of Medicaid a top priority, accusing the Republicans of rejecting an unexpected federal profit. Jones told journalists that January: \"I see no possibility of expanding this meeting,\" and Mantra repeated his first reforms. Jones offended McCullivi's efforts to expand the State budget and opposed it in a party vote in the Hall. :: During a speech on 20 February 2014 in the basement, he said that the expansion should include the work requirements of the beneficiaries of the Medicaid programme for adults who were able to work. The Washington Post, in an article on June 23, 2014, defined Jones as \"a leader in the battle against Medicaid expansion.\" Makulev once again tried to expand Medeked during the last three years of his tenure. Each time, Jones and his appropriation committee strip her of the budget. \"He knows we won't give him that,\" said Jones in December 16, 2016. In an article on April 6, 2017, the Richmond Times - Dispatch - stated that Jones was in a team of five Republican budget negotiators for the house who \"were firmly opposed to the expansion of Medicaid.\" Check the facts (Kirk Cox) was mentioned on January 13, 2021 in a speech. Virginia ranked lowest third of the states in the management of the COVID-19 vaccine. \u2022 January 20, 2012, at that time, the Republicans held 66 of the 100 seats in the House of Representatives. But it was shaken in the 2017 elections when the Democrats received 15 seats and reduced the majority of the People &apos; s Democratic Party to one vote. Speaker Howell, a strong opposition to expansion, did not stand for re-election. Ralph Northam was elected Governor by the Democratic Party. In the changing political landscape, legislators were willing to deal. Johns, 2018 with the blessing of Cox, the new speaker, Jones offered the Republicans home with the budget option to expand Medicaid. It won with sufficient support to pass the house with strong democratic support. The agreement had two main components: * Work requirement for physically capable adults in the Medicaid programme. On January 11, 2018, the Trump Administration announced that it would allow states to establish such programs, thereby eliminating the uncertainty between the Republicans in Virginia. * Hospitals pay for the expansion of the State through a new tax on service providers, an idea proposed by Makulev in 2015 and endorsed on terms that year by Virginia Hospital and the Health Care Association. The hospitals concluded that even with taxes, they would progress because the expansion would reduce their losses in the treatment of uninsured patients. The hospital tax on the federal government has alleviated its fears that if the federal government reduces its financial commitment to expansion, the state will be stuck with a large bill. Jones was also able to refer to a report showing that the Efficiency Committee had reduced government medical assistance costs by $43 million per year. Jones has aligned the deal with Sean, Emmett Hanger, R Augusta, co-chair of the Senate Finance Committee. Hanger was very critical of the majority leader of the senate, Tommy Normint, from R. James, and he got some critical Republican votes. The final deal was passed by the House of Representatives in 68-30 votes to approve the budget, with 21 of the 50 Republicans in support. The Senate, 23-17, approved four of the 21 Republicans in support. During the 7 June celebration of the Capitol steps, Northham signed the state budget that expands Medicaid. Three Republicans were recognized: Jones, Kux and Hanger. Northam said that he would keep a signature pen for Jones, who did not attend the event because of the work. According to Jones, unlike many of his Republican colleagues, he did not take a firm stand against expansion. He always said he'd be open to expansion if Virginia Medicaid was simplified for the first time, and that's what happened. The hospital tax was also the key, \"The question was always how to pay for this,\" he said during the 23 August interview. Jones defended his campaign announcement. \"I have been the chief architect of Medicaid expansion as it is today,\" he also gives credit to Hanger and the management of Northham. \"I was the most important person in this. I got if it's from the ground.\" In addressing the Democratic Party's criticism of his announcement, Jones said: \"Maybe they would have preferred me to say: \"The battle has led to the responsible expansion of Medicaid.\" Jones played a tremendous role in the 2018s of expansion. He was a professional man in building a compromise between the two parties on a case that divided Democrats and Republicans for years. (Joff) Northam, a democracy, recognized the role of Jones. However, the battle to expand the Medicaid programme began in 2013, and during the first four years Jones led the resistance of the Republican majority. He objected to an expansion in a vote on the floor. In his capacity as Chairman of the Board &apos; s Appropriations Committee, he has repeatedly helped to strip the expansion of the proposed mandate budgets. Jones says he never closed the door to expansion and helped achieve Medicked's efficiency, which made expansion easier for the other Republicans. But it can also be said that Jones helped to deny health insurance to 400,000 Virginians for four years. Twenty-nine states expanded their coverage before Virginia. Jones &apos; advertising claim deals with half a complex story. So we're doing it half right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00178"}
