The post is not based in fact.\nFirst, a relatively minor point: The article referred to Pelosi, D-Calif., as the Senate majority leader when she is actually the House minority leader.\nThe reported \"revelations\" are salacious but made up, saying Pelosi is accused of \"unwanted advances\" toward several staffers.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\n stated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe article claims that Senate insiders told military publication Army Times that there may soon be an opening for a new Minority Leader because of the suggested allegations. However, we didn\u2019t find any articles from the Army Times regarding this information.\nAccording to the fake news article, the allegations consist of at least five men and one woman complaining about Pelosi previously making unwanted advances that got swept under the rug.\nNrtOnline cited the right-wing publication Breitbart for breaking this news, but we found no reports by Breitbart regarding this story, either.\nThe story includes more fictional details about cash payments and promotions, but they aren\u2019t worth repeating.\nWe found no evidence by credible news outlets or other sources regarding the truth behind this story. Pelosi\u2019s office also confirmed that she is\u00a0not resigning and that nothing in the story is accurate.\nWe rate this Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02148"}
