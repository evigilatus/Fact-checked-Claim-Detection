The amendment\u2019s approval would allow a new graduated rate structure to take effect in 2021, raising taxes for those earning more than $250,000.\nCorporations that do business in Illinois would also see their flat-rate income tax rate increase from 7% to 7.99% under the plan. But most businesses, especially small ones, don\u2019t pay the corporate tax. Instead, they operate as pass-through entities, which means their profits flow directly to the people who own them and get taxed as individual income.\nJust 3% of Illinois taxpayers overall earn enough to see an increase under the plan, according to the Illinois Department of Revenue. We wondered how different the picture could be for small businesses and their owners.\nSome \u2014 not all \u2014 businesses would pay more\nBased on the way the tax plan is written, the ad is correct that corporations and at least some small businesses operating as pass-through entities would be affected, said Carol Portman, president of the nonpartisan Taxpayers\u2019 Federation of Illinois.\n\"But who exactly is going to be impacted by that tax increase is where the rub is,\" Portman said. \"It's not an across the board increase on all small businesses. It's not an across the board increase on all farmers.\"\nPublicly available federal data isn\u2019t specific enough to show how many small businesses would be affected, experts said. And state data analyzed by Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker\u2019s administration has its own limitations.\nThe data does suggest only a small share of Illinois\u2019 1.2 million small businesses would be affected by the tax plan, for the same reason most individuals wouldn\u2019t see an increase: only those earning more than $250,000 would pay the plan\u2019s higher rates. That\u2019s 189,000 taxpayers overall, according to state data published by the Center for Tax and Budget Accountability,\u00a0which supports the plan.\u00a0\nData suggests most small businesses would not be affected\nA spokeswoman for the coalition pointed to individual income tax data from the Internal Revenue Service for upper-income tax returns reporting different kinds of business income.\n\"Based on IRS data, there are more than 100,000 small businesses in our state, including sole proprietorships, partnerships and S Corporations, that would be impacted by the proposed rates,\" spokeswoman Lissa Druss wrote in an email.\nDruss explained the coalition reached that figure by adding up the number of upper-income tax returns for different categories of pass-through income, then making reductions to account for data limitations. For instance, the IRS doesn\u2019t have an income bracket beginning at $250,000. Instead, its upper-income brackets begin at $200,000, which makes it difficult to determine which taxpayers would be affected.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperts suggested an even bigger problem with the published IRS data.\n\"The table doesn\u2019t tell you anything about small businesses,\" said Eric Toder, co-director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center and a former director of research at the IRS. \"It tells you about the number of tax filers who have some business income.\"\nThe dataset doesn\u2019t show how many separate filers have income from the same business, from how many separate businesses individual filers are drawing income, or how much of those filers\u2019 income is coming from other sources such as wages, Toder said. Filers may also have multiple kinds of business income, so adding up the categories risks counting the same taxpayer twice.\nPritzker has led the push to switch Illinois to a graduated income tax. So we also reached out to his administration to ask for its numbers.\nCameron Mock, chief of staff for the Governor\u2019s Office of Management and Budget, shared an analysis he conducted for the governor\u2019s team based on 2016 data from the state\u2019s Department of Revenue.\nThat analysis estimated at least 95% of small businesses in the state will see no increase under the plan based on the number of them reporting less than $250,000 in net income, along with an assumption that a small share of owners whose businesses net less still make enough from other sources to push them over that threshold. But here too the numbers are not an exact match.\nMock only counted the nearly half million Illinois businesses that file with the state as either partnerships or S-Corporations, which are businesses that pass along their incomes \u2014 and most of their tax bills \u2014 to shareholders. He did not count sole proprietors, because the state does not have data identifying them. S-corporations and partnerships may also have multiple owners splitting up the profits, but the analysis assumed just one individual was paying taxes for each because state data does not show how many separate taxpayers derive income from them, Mock said.\nJ. Fred Giertz, an economist with the Institute of Government & Public Affairs at the University of Illinois, said the fact small business income is largely taxed at the individual level means it doesn\u2019t matter that available data can\u2019t tell us exactly how many would be affected.\n\"There's no particular reason why you should say, \u2018I really feel sorry for the small business owner who's making a million dollars but I don't feel sorry for the opthamologist or the corporate lawyer who's making the same amount of money,\u2019\" Giertz said. \"If you think the tax is good then they should be paying the tax. If you don't think that people above $250,000 should be paying the higher tax, it should not apply to anyone.\"\nOur ruling\nThe coalition\u2019s ad says approving the amendment \"would let the politicians immediately implement their plan to increase taxes on small businesses, farmers and large employers.\"\nCorporations will see an increase in their flat-rate income tax under the plan that takes effect if the amendment is approved. But only a wealthy subset of small businesses, which generally pass their profits to shareholders, would be affected \u2014 and data suggests that portion would be small.\nWe rate this claim Half True.\n\nHALF TRUE \u2013 The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18605"}
