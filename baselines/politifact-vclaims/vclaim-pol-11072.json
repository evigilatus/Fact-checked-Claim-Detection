But do taxpayers foot the bill for MARTA to that great of an extent?\n\nFirst, let\u2019s look at what MARTA\u2019s ridership pays into the system.\n\nMARTA has one of the highest fare rates in the nation following a fare hike from $2 to $2.50 per ride last fall. Helped by a recent fare increase, the agency projects fare revenue this year of $130.3 million \u2013 31 percent of its operating costs. Last year, fares covered 29 percent of operating costs.\n\nSimple math says Bittner\u2019s figures are askew. If riders are paying almost a third, taxpayers can\u2019t be subsidizing 80 percent.\n\n\"Our Libertarian friend is dead wrong,\" MARTA spokesman Lyle Harris concluded.\n\nBut how far off is he? Let\u2019s look at the taxpayer side of the MARTA coin.\n\nThe largest part of MARTA\u2019s current $413.8 million in transit costs is paid by local sales tax. MARTA gets $201.2 million from the penny tax collected in Fulton and DeKalb counties and the city of Atlanta. \n\nOn top of this, the federal government kicks in $37.8 million. A sore point for MARTA backers is that the state of Georgia makes no direct contribution to operate the city\u2019s transit service.\nIn all, MARTA is paying for bus, rail and other services with $239 million in local and federal taxpayer money.\n\nThe service rounds out its revenue pie with some other sources of income. Advertising on buses, parking fees and land leases bring the non-taxpayer funds to $152.1 million.\nMARTA tapped its reserve fund to plug a $22.7 million hole in its operating budget. Officials say the reserve fund is \"mixed\" with taxes and other revenue, but they said the money pulled for this year\u2019s operating budget comes from the sale of real estate decades ago and some other non-tax sources. If the deficit persists, MARTA may end up pulling more tax money out of reserves to fund transit in coming years. \n\nWith figures in hand, the rest is just math: Taxpayers subsidize 57.8 percent of MARTA\u2019s operating costs.\n\nTen years ago, fares made up more than a third of MARTA\u2019s budget, and while ridership is down from 2002, that\u2019s not why taxpayers are being asked to foot more of the bill. Fares increased 13 percent in actual dollars from 2002 to 2011, but the service\u2019s operating expenses increased 38 percent. That gap has to be made up somewhere, and Bittner is right about where, even if the exact percentage is off.\n\n\"I only looked at the cost per trip and the fare per trip. I didn\u2019t use the ancillary figures in the budget,\" he said. \"We\u2019re still subsidizing over half as taxpayers, especially those of us who live and work in Fulton and DeKalb.\"\n\nIn rebuttal, Harris points out every mode of transportation \u2013 including road building \u2013 is subsidized by taxes to some extent.\n\nThat argument aside, Bittner was significantly off in assigning 80 percent of the costs of a MARTA trip to the taxpayer, even if he stands by the larger point.\n\nWe rate his claim as Mostly False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVernon Jones\n\n\nstated on June 3, 2010 in a candidate forum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Four years as a congressman, he [U.S. Rep.
