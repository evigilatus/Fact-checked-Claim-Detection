In more recent years, Kyrillos also has supported some measures labeled by his own Republican colleagues as \"tax increases.\"\n\nFirst, we\u2019ll talk about that tax increase on smokers.\n\nAbout a month after then-Gov. Christine Whitman won re-election, the Republican-controlled Legislature on Dec. 18, 1997 approved Assembly bill A-2157. That legislation doubled the cigarette tax from 40 cents to 80 cents per pack, and the tobacco products wholesale tax from 24 percent to 48 percent of the wholesale price.\n\nAccording to the minutes of that day\u2019s proceedings, Kyrillos was one of 33 senators to vote for the bill. The next day, Whitman signed the bill into law.\n\nAlso, in 1998, Kyrillos was a co-sponsor of a bill to increase the gas tax, but since the measure never made it to the Senate floor, Kyrillos didn't get a chance to vote on it.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the 2017 tax law, \u201cpeople who make under $75,000 will have their taxes raised in 2021 and every 2 years after that until 2027.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s good enough to prove Kyrillos\u2019 claim is wrong, but let\u2019s also look at his votes on what his own Republican colleagues have referred to as \"tax increases.\"\n\nOver the last several years, the Democrat-led Legislature has approved numerous tax and fee increases -- a subject that Republican legislators frequently criticize. In October, we fact-checked a claim by Senate Minority Leader Tom Kean Jr. that Democrats had increased taxes more than 115 times.\n\nCalling them all \"tax increases,\" a Senate Republican spokesman sent us a list of tax increases, fee hikes and tax policy changes between fiscal years 2003 and 2010.\n\nKyrillos voted against most of those bills, but not all of them. Here are a couple of examples where -- by his own party\u2019s measure -- Kyrillos supported tax increases:\n\nIn January 2008, Kyrillos supported a bill that increased fees and penalties related to handling explosives. In June 2009, Kyrillos voted for legislation that, in part, allowed certain municipalities to impose a tax on car rentals.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Kyrillos has rejected certain major tax increases in recent years.\n\nFor example, when the Legislature agreed in July 2006 to increase the sales tax to 7 percent and expand it to various transactions, Kyrillos said no. Kyrillos also rejected a measure in June 2009 to temporarily increase certain state income tax rates.\n\nIn response to our findings, Kyrillos spokeswoman Meaghan Cronin pointed to the senator\u2019s record of opposing \"broad-based tax increases, such as increases in income, sales and business taxes.\"\n\nCronin cited four of Kyrillos\u2019 specific votes against new or increased taxes. Those measures included the sales tax increase in 2006; a hotel tax in 2003; a business tax increase in 2002; and a tax against health insurers in 2005.\n\n\"Most recently, Senator Kyrillos supported Governor Chris Christie\u2019s local 2 percent property tax and spending cap,\" Cronin said in an e-mail, referring to a July 2010 vote in favor of the cap.\n\nOur ruling\n\nIn an April 17 message on his campaign website, Kyrillos offered this biographical note: \"In my years in the State Legislature, I have never voted for a tax increase.\"\n\nKyrillos has voted against certain major tax hikes -- such as increasing sales and income taxes -- but the senator is wrong to claim he \"never voted for a tax increase.\"\n\nIn December 1997, Kyrillos voted to double the tax rates on cigarettes and tobacco products. More recently, Kyrillos has supported some measures labeled by his own Republican colleagues as \"tax increases.\"\n\nWe rate the statement False.\n\nTo comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11191"}
