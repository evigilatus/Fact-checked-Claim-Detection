Santorum, who has repeatedly called climate change \"a hoax,\" shot back by arguing that there really isn\u2019t scientific consensus.\n\"I\u2019m not alone,\" Santorum said on Maher\u2019s Aug. 28 HBO show. \"The most recent survey of climate scientists said about 57 percent don\u2019t agree with the idea that 95 percent of the change in the climate is caused by CO2.\"\nSantorum, pressed by an incredulous Maher, repeated the claim: \"There was a survey done of 1,800 scientists, and 57 percent said they don\u2019t buy off on the idea that CO2 is the knob that\u2019s turning the climate. There\u2019s hundreds of reasons the climate\u2019s changed.\"\n\"Rick, I don\u2019t know what ass you\u2019re pulling that out of,\" Maher retorted.\n\"I\u2019m not! I\u2019ll send you the survey,\" Santorum promised.\nSeveral readers wrote to us asking about Santorum\u2019s numbers, so we asked his campaign to send us the survey as well. They didn\u2019t get back to us, but we did find the figure. \u00a0\nIn short, Santorum\u2019s claim commits \"two orders of mischaracterization,\" said Anthony Leiserowitz, who studies climate change public opinion at Yale University. He not only uses a\u00a0flawed statistic, but also misstates what it\u2019s allegedly disapproving.\nSantorum\u2019s sloppy reading\nTo begin with, Santorum inaccurately describes the \"idea\" that he says 57 percent of scientists \"don\u2019t agree with.\"\nWhat he\u2019s referring to is a finding by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in its fifth report.\nThe IPCC has said it is \"extremely likely\" (meaning a 95 percent confidence level) that humans are causing climate change. The IPCC also said it is \"very likely\" (meaning a 90 percent confidence level) that greenhouses gases are the driver.\nSantorum restated IPCC points wrong. They never said 95 percent of the change in the climate is caused by CO2.\nIn fact, no one has ever made that statement, according to Leiserowitz.\n\"There are several other greenhouse gases, including methane, nitrous oxide, and water vapor, as a amplifier. CO2 is the most important of these and others, but no one to my knowledge has ever claimed that CO2 caused 95 percent of the warming,\" he said.\nThe closest IPCC comes to what Santorum claimed is saying that there\u2019s a 90 percent chance that greenhouse gases are driving climate. That\u2019s a far cry from what Santorum actually said.\nEven still, the 57 percent figure doesn\u2019t hold up.\nFuzzy math\nThe figure likely comes from the blog Fabius Maximus (and repeated by the prominent climate change skeptic Joanne Nova), which re-analyzed the findings of a 2014 survey by the Dutch environmental research agency PBL.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Fabius Maximus editor Larry Kummer, the survey\u2019s findings disprove the IPCC's confidence level finding. He walked us through how he got the 57 percent:\n1. About 65.9 percent of scientists said they agreed that greenhouse gases were the main driver of climate change.\n2. Of those scientists, 65.2 percent reported \"virtually certain\" or it was \"extremely likely\" that their estimate was correct (corresponding to a 95 percent or higher confidence level).\n3. That means, according to Kummer, about 43 percent (65.2 percent of 65.9 percent) were extremely confident that greenhouse gases were the main driver of climate change. In other words, 57 percent weren\u2019t 95 percent confident.\nWe ran Kummer\u2019s analysis by a few experts, including the survey authors themselves, who said his interpretation is flat-out wrong.\nThe survey\u2019s lead author, Bart Verheggen, told us that Kummer \u2014 and, by extension, Santorum \u2014 made a few mistakes.\nFirst, 22 percent of climate scientists surveyed didn\u2019t directly answer a question as to what extent greenhouse gases were causing climate change, says Verheggen. Verheggen said it would be more accurate to consider only those who answered the question. (He goes into more detail in a blog post.)\nSecond, Kummer only counts scientists who were 95 percent or more confident that greenhouse gases drive climate change, when the actual IPCC statement reports a 90 percent certainty, Verheggen pointed out.\n\"Basically, Santorum\u2019s claim is not consistent with the results from our survey,\" Verheggen concluded.\n\"This is like something out of that book, How to Lie With Statistics,\" said Stephen Farnsworth, who studies climate change and political communication at the University of Mary Washington. \"What we\u2019re talking about here is extraordinary cherry-picking. You\u2019re only counting one question in one survey, and you\u2019re talking about a very high (confidence level). Once you start stacking up numbers like this, you\u2019re really distorting the real finding of this research.\"\nWhat the survey (and others) actually say\nThe real finding of the survey actually backs the idea of scientific consensus on climate change, despite varying levels of confidence, said Verheggen.\n\"It is clear from our survey that a strong majority of scientists agree that greenhouse gases originating from human activity are the dominant cause of recent warming,\" he said.\nThat\u2019s consistent with most of the literature on scientific opinion about climate change, experts agreed.\n\"You don't get anywhere near 57 percent when surveying the broad earth science community, and you get very close to full consensus when you ask the experts in climate science,\" said Peter Doran, a professor of earth science at Louisiana State University.\nNational Science Board member James Powell surveyed what\u2019s actually published in scientific journals, finding that the consensus in the literature is about 99.9 percent. And multiple independent studies have \"asked scientists directly\"\u00a0and found consensus levels of around 97 percent, said William Anderegg, who studies climate change at Princeton University. \u00a0\n\"Those studies were rigorously peer-reviewed and thus should be considered more credible than a blog post that misreads an institute report,\" he said.\nOur ruling\nSantorum said, \"The most recent survey of climate scientists said about 57 percent don\u2019t agree with the idea that 95 percent of the change in the climate is caused by CO2.\"\nHe\u2019s not pulling the numbers out of thin air, as Maher suggests more bluntly, but the claim is inaccurate and misleading. Essentially, Santorum garbles a blog\u2019s textbook misinterpretation of a survey. In reality, the survey actually supports the idea of scientific consensus on climate change, the lead author told us.\nWe rate Santorum\u2019s claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06012"}
