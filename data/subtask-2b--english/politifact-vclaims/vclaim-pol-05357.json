But the data is from 1980, part of a paper that talks about drug dealing and legitimate self-employment.\nThe campaign also had fresher data in mind, however, including a USA Today analysis of arrest rates around the country\u00a0in the wake of the racial unrest in Ferguson, Mo. In at least 1,581 of 3,538 police departments, the paper found, blacks were even more likely to be arrested than in Ferguson. Only 173 departments \"arrested black people at a rate equal to or lower than other racial groups,\" the paper reported.\nThe Bureau of Justice Statistics periodically surveys the public to study police-citizen interactions. Its most recent report in 2008 found that white, black and Hispanic drivers were stopped at similar rates by police. However, black drivers were about three times as likely as white drivers to be searched during a traffic stop. (When a search occurred, evidence was found in only 8.4 percent of the cases, but the report doesn't break that down by race.)\nThe Sentencing Project, an advocacy group, has looked at that breakdown using 2013 profiling data posted in 2014 by Missouri's attorney general's office. It found that when a white driver was stopped in Ferguson, there was a 7 percent chance the car would be searched and a 34 percent chance that something would be found. But when a black driver was stopped, the search rate was significantly higher \u2014 12 percent \u2014 and the odds of actually finding contraband were significantly lower (22 percent).\nNot only that, blacks were twice as likely as whites to be arrested during a traffic stop.\nIn a spot check, we found similar patterns in Jefferson City. \nIt's not just traffic stops. According to a National Research Council report, drug arrest rates have long been higher for blacks, even though data show that blacks are generally no more likely to use drugs than whites and there's little evidence that they sell drugs more often than whites.\n\nWhat surveys have shown \"is that the levels of self-reported drug sales are about the same for blacks and whites, especially under age 20,\" said Michael Tonry, professor of law at the University of Minnesota. \"But the big differences are that whites are more likely to sell to people they know, and they much more often sell behind closed doors. Blacks sell to people they don't know and in public, which makes them vastly easier to arrest.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSentencing\nThere is also evidence for Clinton\u2019s statement that blacks are more likely to get a stiffer sentence than a white person who has been convicted of the same crime and has the same criminal history.\nStudies have shown, for instance, that when prosecutors are deciding on what charges to file against suspects, they tend to select more severe charges for blacks and to use habitual offender laws against blacks more than whites under similar circumstances, particularly when it comes to drug and property crimes, according to a Florida study reported in the journal Criminology.\nA 2013 study in the Yale Law Journal reported that black men were nearly twice as likely to be charged with an offense that carried a mandatory minimum sentence than white men facing similar circumstances. When judges have discretion over how long a sentence should be for a specific crime, they tend to select longer sentences for blacks even if they have the same criminal history.\nAfter controlling for the arrest offense, a person's criminal history and other characteristics, sentences for black males were about 10 percent higher than for whites, the study found.\nThe problem is that as cases work their way through the various steps of the criminal justice system, the degree of the disparity \"accumulates at each level,\" said Nazgol Ghandnoosh, a research analyst at the Sentencing Project.\n\"You're a little bit more likely to get arrested if you're a person of color than if you're white. You're a little bit more likely to have a higher bail amount to be released. That's going to make it harder for you to get released. You're a little more likely to get a worse plea deal offer,\" she said. \"As you go through the system, each individual stage makes some small contribution to the overall disparity that we see. But it's going to be significant as you go through the stages.\"\nTonry of the University of Minnesota agreed that sentences are longer for blacks generally, but \"it depends hugely on what crime you're talking about.\n\"If it's a drug crime that's affected by mandatory minimums, it's vastly longer,\" Tonry said. \"If you're talking about things not subject to mandatory minimums, on average, across the board, blacks probably get sentences that are 5 percent or 10 percent longer than whites do.\" \u00a0\nHow much of this is due to racism is a matter of debate. The experts say poverty may play a major role, but it can be hard to separate the two. The best studies try to adjust for the fact that minorities tend to be concentrated in poorer areas, where crime tends to be higher and there's a greater demand for police. That can skew the numbers.\nAnd sentences can be longer for poor people under pressure to cop a plea because they can't afford bail or a good lawyer.\nOur ruling\nClinton said, \"African-Americans are more likely to be arrested by police and sentenced to longer prison terms for doing the same thing that whites do.\"\nThe research suggests that when you compare what happens to black and whites who are engaging in the same illegal activity and have the same criminal history, African Americans are more likely to be arrested, more likely to face tougher charges, and more likely to receive longer sentences than their caucasian counterparts.\nWe rate the claim as True.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShare The Facts\n\n\nHillary Clinton\nPresidential candidate\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\"African-Americans are more likely to be arrested by police and sentenced to longer prison terms for doing the same thing that whites do.\"\n\u00a0\nIn a TV ad \u2013 Tuesday, February 23, 2016\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEmbed\n\n\n\nShare\nRead more", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05357"}
