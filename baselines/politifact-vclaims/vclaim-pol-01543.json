Rick Scott's attack on Sen. Bill Nelson for skipping security hearings", "text": "Gov. Rick Scott portrays U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson as an \"empty chair\" who often skips meetings on the important topic of security.\n\"Nelson skipped 45 percent of the hearings on national security,\" said a TV ad from Scott\u2019s campaign. \"National security! Bill Nelson doesn\u2019t write laws \u2014 he doesn\u2019t even show up.\"\nThe ad refers to Nelson\u2019s tenure on the Senate Armed Services Committee. Nelson is defending his seat in a close battle with Scott.\nAttacks for missed hearings are common. But these attacks omit several caveats about committee attendance.\n\"I have never been one that put much stock in the \u2018attendance\u2019 statistics to measure a senator's work\" on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said Arnold Punaro, who served as the committee's Democratic staff director from 1983 to 1997.\nSenate Armed Committee meetings\nScott\u2019s campaign published a spreadsheet showing that between 2001 and 2018, Nelson missed 45 percent (or 284 out of 636) of Senate Armed Service Committee hearings. (He wasn\u2019t on the committee in 2011-12.) The campaign said it counted full committee hearings and subcommittees on which Nelson served and was expected to attend.\nNelson\u2019s attendance varied with each two-year congressional session, ranging from 44 percent in 2005-06 to 76 percent for the current 2017-18 session.\nScott\u2019s campaign pulled attendance records from the Senate Armed Services Committee website and the Government Printing Office. However, attendance isn\u2019t published for closed or classified hearings.\nSince there aren\u2019t public attendance records for all types of hearings, that means we don\u2019t get the full picture of Nelson\u2019s service on the committee.\nDan McLaughlin, Nelson\u2019s spokesman, said by his count Nelson attended 104 of 126 Armed Services hearings, informal meetings, sessions and briefings \u2014 including more than two dozen that were closed or classified \u2014 in 2017-18.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJake Tapper\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in remarks in a CNN broadcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second presidential impeachment of Donald Trump was \u201cthe most bipartisan impeachment in American history.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolitiFact can\u2019t verify the Nelson campaign\u2019s figures since that includes meetings that lack a public attendance record.\nThe limits of sheer attendance\nExperts on Congress agreed that a straight-up attendance record doesn\u2019t tell us much.\n\"A hearing about a national security threat, for example, is much more significant than routine budget hearings the (committee) holds every fiscal year,\" said Georgetown University professor Joshua Huder, who studies Congress.\nIt is common for senators, who serve on multiple committees and subcommittees, to miss hearings. Sometimes, multiple committees will hold hearings at the same time, forcing the senator to split their time or prioritize one hearing over another.\nRoll Call, a Washington publication that regularly covers Congress, wrote in 2014 that unless the senator wields the gavel, he or she may only show up for five minutes, or when it is their turn to ask questions\n\"The results include guffaw-inducing scenes where even senior lawmakers enter the wrong hearing room, misidentify a witness and question the wrong person on the other side of the dais,\" Roll Call wrote.\nOur ruling\nScott said Nelson \"skipped 45 percent of the hearings on national security.\"\nThe Scott campaign\u2019s data for Nelson\u2019s 16 years on the Senate Armed Services Committee shows he missed 284 hearings out of 636.\nHowever, this omits that for some types of hearings there is no publicly available attendance record. This count is not perfect.\nWe rate this statement Mostly True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9c661c02-d2f0-4053-bc63-1148f4d45ed4", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01543"}
