Current wars have been funded almost entirely by borrowing, according to the nonprofit, nonpartisan Cost of War Project housed at Brown University.\n\n\nWe found various sources that have studied war costs. Some factor in future benefit costs and debt repayment; others include only funds that have been spent and approved by Congress.\n\n\nTwo recent studies, both published this year, estimate the cost of the two wars has reached $4 trillion. The first, published in March by Harvard professor Linda Bilmes, found that the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts will be the most expensive wars in U.S. history, totaling between $4 trillion and $6 trillion. Along with traditional war costs such as weapons and equipment, Bilmes\u2019 study included long-term medical and disability costs for service members and their families.\n\n\nThe second study, by the Cost of War Project, lists current spending, including interest paid on war debt, through fiscal 2013 at $3.1 trillion. Add in future veterans\u2019 obligations, and the amount reaches about $4 trillion. The amount could rise much higher based on future interest payments.\n\n\nCensus data reports almost 115 million households existed in the country from 2007-2011, according to the most recent data.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMitch McConnell\n\n\nstated on February 27, 2009 in a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In just one month, the Democrats have spent more than President Bush spent in seven years on the war in Iraq, the war in Afghanistan and Hurricane Katrina combined.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Alexander Lane \u2022 March 3, 2009\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt $4 trillion, each of the 115 million households would be responsible for just under $35,000 of the war costs. At $6 trillion, the household responsibility would rise to around $52,000.\n\n\nRoberts\u2019 claim initially seemed a bit high, but is in the range of estimates based on the most recent studies, said Christopher A. Preble, vice president for defense and foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.\n\n\n\"I think it\u2019s essential to give a full picture of costs (including debt service and future veterans\u2019 benefits and expenses),\" Preble said. \"Don\u2019t assume the cost of war ends when the shooting stops.\"\n\n\nOther studies don\u2019t factor in these long-term costs.\n\n\nThe National Priorities Project operates the Cost of War website, which keeps a running total of the costs for both the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. This past week, the constantly increasing total had reached over $1.4 trillion. Based on that figure, each of the country\u2019s households would be responsible for around $12,300 in war costs thus far. Data from the Congressional Budget Office also shows that about $1.4 trillion has been approved for the wars, including some funds for veterans\u2019 benefits and services.\n\n\nNational Priorities, a nonprofit organization that analyzes the federal budget, includes only funds that have been appropriated by the government that can be found in appropriations documents. The site makes no attempt to project future costs, such as veterans\u2019 benefits and medical costs.\n\n\n\"There are a lot of people who think that is a component,\" said Chris Hellman, a senior research analyst with National Priorities. \"We acknowledge that this is a growing edge of what our nation\u2019s commitment is, but we look only at the narrowly construed combat operations and related support costs of the wars.\"\n\n\nA website feature provides the amount of the $1.4 trillion that taxpayers in each state, county and major city have paid toward the wars, and also provides a list of services that could have been provided for the same amount of money. (For example, Georgia taxpayers have contributed $35.6 billion, which could have also funded 721,000 police officers, or 4.8 million Head Start slots, or 4.7 million college scholarships, etc., for one year.)\n\n\nSo, do Roberts\u2019 numbers add up?\n\n\nHer claim that the Iraq and Afghanistan wars have cost each U.S. household $45,000 would mean that war spending -- including future veterans\u2019 benefits and debt service costs -- would have to be about $5.2 trillion.\n\n\nThe most recent studies that include these long-term costs report war spending between $4 trillion and $6 trillion. Studies that do not include the long-term costs list war costs at $1.4 trillion thus far in funds that have been approved by Congress.\n\n\nAssuming Roberts\u2019 claim factored in future expenses, her claim would fall in the appropriate range of estimated spending. But leave those out, and she comes up short.\n\n\nHer claim is partially accurate, but needs a lot of context to be fully understood.\n\n\nWe rate Roberts\u2019 claim Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09342"}
