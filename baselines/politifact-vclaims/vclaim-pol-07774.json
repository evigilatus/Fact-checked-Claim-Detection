Asked later to repeat himself, Martinez said in a voice-mail message: \"I think we\u2019ve had four Latinos in the designated \u2018gentlemen\u2019s agreement\u2019 seat\" on the council,\" plus, he said, another council member who says he was Latino, the late Robert Barnstone.\n\"That would be five total,\" Martinez said, adding he speculated at the event that up to five Hispanic residents could be elevated to the council all at once in the November elections.\nFor the first time, voters are poised to fill 10 council seats from within geographic districts with the mayor\u2019s job filled, as before, by citywide balloting.\nAnd has Austin, which was incorporated in 1839, only had a few Hispanic council members?\nNews organizations including the Austin American-Statesman have noted the \"gentlemen\u2019s agreement\" mentioned by Martinez as explaining why the seven-member council, elected citywide, has rarely had more than a black and an Hispanic member. Under the so-called agreement, certain seats on the council were seen among many as reserved for members of those minority groups to seek.\nThe results: A \"Milestones\" web page created by the city says John Trevi\u00f1o was the first Hispanic citizen elected to the council; he won Place 5 on May 3, 1975. Voters had made Beryl Handcox the council\u2019s first African American in May 1971, according to the page.\nAn Aug. 20, 2010, Statesman news feature story on local Mexican American pioneers called Trevi\u00f1o the first Hispanic on the council and further said Gus Garcia, a former Austin school board trustee, later won election to the council before winning election in 2000 as mayor.\nGarcia, who like Trevi\u00f1o initially won Place 5 on the council, said Trevi\u00f1o and Richard Moya, the first Mexican American elected to the Travis County Commissioners Court, were \"young Turks\" who sought to break free from a long-standing system in which a handful of Hispanic leaders and businessmen had access to Anglo leaders, the story said. \"We wanted to make it more democratic,\" Garcia said then. \"None of us thought about doing this so we could be recognized. We did it because there was a need in the (Mexican American) community.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 22, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden \u201chas issued more executive fiats than anyone in such a short period of time, ever, more than Obama, more than Trump, more than anyone.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo our request for detail, city spokeswoman Alicia Dean guided us to the Austin History Center where researcher Jeff Carrillo pointed out city election results through history, posted online. This enabled us to build a chart indicating four Spanish-surnamed winners of council seats.\nIn 2000, environmental activist Raul Alvarez won election to Place 2 on the council, to which Garcia didn\u2019t seek re-election, our chart indicates. Alvarez was re-elected in 2003 but didn\u2019t seek another term in 2006, when Martinez initially won the seat.\nThis leaves Barnstone, who succeeded Trevi\u00f1o in Place 5 in 1988.\nGarcia, asked for his recollections, told us by email that in Austin\u2019s Mexican-American community, Barnstone wasn\u2019t considered \"one of us.\"\nSeparately, the center\u2019s Molly Hults pointed out Barnstone\u2019s June 25, 2008, Statesman paid obituary stating Barnstone grew up in Laredo as part of a \"legendary Texas and Mexican family.\" At the time, the Statesman\u2019s front-page news story on Barnstone\u2019s passing described him as a charismatic developer and \"campaigner who never failed to use his fluent Spanish on the trail - his mother, born in Veracruz, Mexico, raised him; his Anglo father died before Barnstone was born.\"\nOur ruling\nMartinez said there have been four or maybe five Hispanic council members.\nWe'd say five.
