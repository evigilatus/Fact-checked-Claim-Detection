We checked.\n\nGender pay data\n\nKaine\u2019s statement was based on two reports, according to Lily Adams, a campaign spokeswoman.\n\nBoth the National Women\u2019s Law Center and the National Partnership for Women and Families, supporters of the Fairness Act, created fact sheets on wage disparity in each state.\n\nThe organizations relied on data from the U.S. Census Bureau, which tracks annual wages in its Current Population Survey. \u00a0In 2010, the statistics and showed women made 77 cents for every dollar men earned across the country. President Barack Obama and other Democrats used the \u00a0figure to urge passage of the Paycheck Fairness Act.\n\nThe Census Bureau also reports state figures in its American Community Survey. They show in Virginia, women earned 79 cents for every dollar men made in 2010.\n\nBut the annual wage comparisons does not take into consideration those who work less than full-time and less than year-round.\n\nThe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics looks at weekly wages instead of annual pay. The national median pay for women was $669 a week in 2010, or 81 percent of men\u2019s median weekly pay of $824. The weekly wage data does not include the pay of self-employed people. But it does factor those who do not work year-round, such as teachers, some construction workers and seasonal workers. And, as with the annual figures, men tend to work more hours.\n\nIn Virginia, BLS figures show women in 2010 earned a median $719 a week, or 75.2 percent of men\u2019s median weekly pay of $956. So while using weekly figures narrows the gender wage gap nationally, it broadens the disparity in Virginia. \u00a0\n\nThe national gender gap shrinks for workers paid hourly rates. Women are paid 86 percent of the median hourly wages of men, according to the BLS data for 2010. This data includes those who work part-time, a status women seek more than men, according to a Pew Research Center survey. In 2010, 27 percent of women worked part-time compared to 13 percent of men did in 2010.\n\nState-specific data is not available for hourly wages.\n\nWhich numbers are the best?\n\nExperts disagree on the best way to measure pay disparity and why women make less than men.\n\n\"Hourly wage ratios are better than annual or weekly but none of them get to the important reasons for wage differentials,\" said June O\u2019Neill, director of the Center for the Study of Business and Government at Baruch College at the City University of New York.\n\nShe added, \"The underlying reason for the various differentials have been spelled out by me and other economists -- namely that women's greater ties to child care limit their choices of occupations and type of work.\"\n\nO\u2019Neill\u2019s research shows that single, childless women make about the same as single, childless men in the same education in the same occupations.\n\nAn 2009 analysis by the nonpartisan CONSAD Research Corp. in Pittsburgh also concluded that the wage gap is not simply a product of sexism. CONSAD found that three-fourths of the disparity can be explained by other trends common to women: they tend to choose occupations that have relatively low wages; they tend have degrees leading to lower-paying occupations than men; they tend to have a shorter work history and take more time off from work for childbirth and child care.\n\nCONSAD said these factors, when considered, reduce the pay gap to between 4 to 7 percent, which could be result of discrimination.\n\n\"As a result, it is not possible now, and doubtless will never be possible, to determine reliably whether any portion of the observed gender wage gap is not attributable to factors that compensate women and men different on socially acceptable bases, and hence can confidently be attributed to overt discrimination against women,\" the report said.\n\nBut where CONSAD concluded that adjusting for variables reduces the likelihood of discrimination, others disagree.\n\nAriane Hegewisch, study director at the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research in Washington, said bias is not limited to the walls of the workplace. She said society expects women to work fewer hours than men so they can care for children.\n\n\"The focus on saying, \u2018Is it direct discrimination?\u2019 neglects that only part of this is direct discrimination,\" she said in an interview. \"Really the rest is that women are more likely to take time out when they have children, but the question is whether you think that\u2019s right when men and women have children but women are taking time off?\"\n\nShe said the data that shows a 21-cent gap in Virginia has been used the longest and \"provides the best reference for change over time.\" And the full-time, year-round employees the annual data includes are the \"most committed\" to work.\n\n\"Whichever way you measure a wage gap, a wage gap remains,\" Hegewisch said.\n\nOur ruling\n\nTim Kaine said women earn 79 cents to each dollar that men earn in Virginia.\n\nOf the two databases that measure pay for men and women in each state, Kaine used the one with the smaller earning gap in Virginia and described its finding accurately.\n\nBut gender pay is a complicated subject and there are many reasons -- in addition to discrimination -- why a gap exists: women tend to work fewer hours than men; they tend to choose lower paying professions than men; they tend to take more time off than men to tend to children.\n\nKaine\u2019s statement lacks this context. It creates an impression that men are being paid much more than women when their qualifications, occupations and work hours are the same. So we rate his statement Mostly True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Boysko\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in a committee debate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe United States is the only industrialized, modernized country that does not already have a paid family medical leave program in place.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 28, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10919"}
