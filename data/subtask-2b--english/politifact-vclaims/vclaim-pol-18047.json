Joe Biden in 1975 \u2014 passionate speech defending segregation,\" stated a March 2 Facebook post.\nThe accompanying side-by-side photos show Sanders being arrested and Biden from decades ago. The post has been circulating at least since June 2019, around the time that Biden\u2019s past statements on busing became a hot topic in the Democratic primary.\nWe found that the post is accurate about Sanders\u2019 arrest, but it doesn\u2019t tell the full story about Biden\u2019s record on segregation.\u00a0\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nSanders\u2019 1963 arrest protesting segregation\nWe previously fact-checked a separate Facebook post that stemmed from Sanders\u2019 1963 arrest in Chicago.\nThe Chicago Tribune wrote a story in February 2016 about the photo and confirmed with Sanders\u2019 campaign that it was him.\nSanders, who at the time was a 21-year-old student at the University of Chicago, was arrested in August 1963 at a South Side protest over school segregation. Sanders was charged with resisting arrest, found guilty and fined $25, according to the Tribune\u2019s reporting.\nThe protests that led to the arrest were over mobile classrooms dubbed \"Willis Wagons,\" named for then-Chicago Schools Superintendent Benjamin Willis. Black children were kept in the trailers rather than being allowed in white schools.\nA January 1964 Tribune story on the court cases of those who had been arrested mentioned a Bernard Sanders.\nBiden\u2019s statements on segregation and busing\nRELATED: Joe Biden oversimplifies his school busing record in Miami debate\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Facebook post doesn\u2019t cite a particular speech by Biden, then a Delaware U.S. senator, in 1975, but it likely refers to his statements opposing busing.\nBiden won his Senate seat in 1972 on a platform of integration, but once in office, he faced white constituents who overwhelmingly opposed busing to achieve integration. A Gallup poll in 1973 found that while a majority of Americans supported school integration, only 5% supported busing.\u00a0\nA federal court order in 1974 to integrate Wilmington, Del., schools brought the issue home for Biden. In the Senate, he began supporting much of the anti-busing legislation.\nIn 1975, Biden supported an amendment by Sen. Jesse Helms, a North Carolina conservative who opposed civil rights, while stating he didn\u2019t share all the views of those who opposed busing.\nThe amendment, which Helms called an \"anti-busing amendment\" was intended to ban schools from using federal funds to classify teachers or students based on race..\n\"I have become convinced that busing is a bankrupt concept that, in fact, does not bear any of the fruit for which it was designed,\" Biden said on the Senate floor Sept. 17, 1975. \"If anything, it obfuscates the real issue today, which is whether or not there is equal opportunity within the educational field for all people within the United States.\"\u00a0\nBiden said that rather than busing, the Senate should focus on all areas of opportunity in housing, education, equal credit and voting rights to provide minorities with equal access.\nWhen the Helms amendment was defeated, Biden himself proposed measures to oppose busing as a segregation remedy.\u00a0\nBut that same year, Biden co-sponsored a 10-year extension of the Voting Rights Act, sponsored legislation to prohibit creditors from discriminating on the basis of race and opposed the nomination of Ben Blackburn, who had voted against civil rights bills in Congress, to the federal bench.\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post said \"Bernie Sanders in 1963 \u2014 arrested protesting segregation. Joe Biden in 1975 \u2014 passionate speech defending segregation.\"\nThe post is correct about Sanders \u2014 he was arrested in Chicago in 1963 for protesting school segregation. But the text attacks Biden too broadly when it states that he was \"defending segregation.\"\nBiden did oppose court-ordered busing in 1975, a program intended to achieve school integration. But he supported other legislation that aimed to fight segregation in housing and expand voting rights.\nWe rate this statement Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18047"}
