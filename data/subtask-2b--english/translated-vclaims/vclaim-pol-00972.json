In January, a picture of feet coming out of a bathtub was mistakenly described as a naked photograph of a member of the Democratic Congress from New York. The bloggers attributed false quotations to her in a clear attempt to make her look stupid. Now what appears to be Photoshop's image is used to discredit Okasio Cortez. The picture, which was posted on Facebook on February 15, shows a man carrying a woman from her arms while holding her legs open in the air. Looks like Okasio Cortez is laughing. While there are many pictures on the Internet of her laughter, this picture is very similar to this one taken after she won the democratic primary in June. We have not been able to find any reliable sources of image, or news coverage that confirms that it is Okasio Cortez, a normal number in media reports. It's very close to the picture, showing a different woman with the same man who carries it, which was shared several years ago.

Some people commented that the picture looked fake, but the calculation doubled: \"I have been drawn to the point that some have been insulted by this article, so let me make it clear: this is not a joke to laugh at, but a serious look at the character of Congresswoman. I had thought of \"disturbing\" parts of the picture, but this would provoke (as is the case) the appearance of Photoshop, so I chose to publish the original, unmodified image. This is a picture of Congresswoman acting like Miley Cyrus, and if you feel insulted, make sure: us too.\" The Ocacio Cortez office did not respond to an e-mail from Polyte Fact on the authenticity of the photo. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 January 11, 2012, let us reflect closely on the picture. ............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Google suggests \"crazy girl\" as a possible related research. The search for the opposite image of a man or a boy, it is difficult to know his age, shows a picture that has existed for at least many years. An article about four years ago entitled \"Nuclear fart\" was posted on the MemeCenter website. A photo in the comments section shows the same picture that appears on Facebook with the face of Okasio Cortez. Just this picture shows the face of a different woman, sticking her tongue out. The photo was also published by Google Plus on 29 December 2014. On television after the husband, then President George W. Bush was addressing the nation from New Orleans on 15 September 2005, in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. Okasio Cortez was born on October 13, 1989. This means that unless they see a recording of Bush's speech after years, she's supposed to be 15 years old in the picture. But the so-called picture of Okasio Cortez seems contemporary.
