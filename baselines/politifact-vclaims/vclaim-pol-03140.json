Pete Olson said in a June 9, 2017, interview on the Houston-based Sam Malone Show.\nConspiracy theories have abounded since Foster\u2019s body was found in 1993--all of a part with unsubstantiated tales alleging the Clintons share a sordid history of sidelining people. Over the years, debunkists at Snopes.com\u00a0and for\u00a0The Washington Post\u2019s Fact Checker each\u00a0found no basis to claims about fishiness in Foster's death.\nOlson, R-Sugar Land, initially said in his radio interview that it was \"awfully strange\" for Bill Clinton to bump into then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch on an Arizona airport tarmac at a time in 2016 when Hillary Clinton\u2019s handling of email\u00a0was under Justice Department review.\n\"I guarantee you,\" Olson said, \"they had the conversation where he basically said, \u2018Mrs. Lynch, call your attack dog off. We\u2019ve killed people. We killed Vince Foster. We destroyed Webb Hubbell. We will destroy you.\u2019 And then what happens to things?,\" Olson said. \"All of a sudden--well, she did it, yeah, it was all terrible, don\u2019t know who got the information, very classified. But no indictment.\"\nOlson was correct about about a few points.\nBill Clinton on June 27, 2016, met privately with Lynch in a plane on the tarmac of Phoenix\u2019s airport. Also, Hillary Clinton was not indicted for how she handled confidential emails. By authoritative accounts, too, Foster, an Arkansas lawyer close to the Clintons, suffered from depression affected by what he felt to be his own personal failings in handling White House events including the Travelgate and Whitewater matters before he was found dead with a gun in his hand in a Washington-area park.\nBut we identified no evidence for Olson\u2019s claim that Bill Clinton told Lynch the Clintons killed Foster.\nLynch insisted at the time that the airplane\u00a0conversation centered on topics such as Clinton\u2019s grandchildren. Our search of the Nexis news database turned up no Bill Clinton accounts of what was discussed.\nA delayed backpedal\nOlson himself backed off after his account was brought to light by Right Wing Watch, a project of a liberal group, People for the American Way, 11 days after the radio interview. In a written statement made available the same day, Olson said in part that \"in my discussion about Loretta Lynch and Vince Foster, I took the accusations a step too far. I regret my choice of words.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in remarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn June 23, 2017, we asked Olson after he spoke at a Capitol Hill conference on civility in public life if he\u2019d intended his radio comment about Bill Clinton to be factual. Olson replied: \"That was a little out of bounds. It was over the top. I regret it and I apologized for it.\"\nInvestigations\nA series of investigations of Foster\u2019s death include the July 1994 finding of a special counsel, Robert B. Fiske Jr., that Foster\u2019s death in the area\u2019s Fort Marcy Park in July 1993 was a suicide influenced by Foster\u2019s depression associated with episodes involving his legal work for the Clinton White House. Fiske concluded that \"Foster's death was a personal collapse, not a White House scandal,\" The Washington Post said in a news story at the time.\n\"The Fiske investigation involved four lawyers, five physicians, seven FBI agents, approximately 125 witnesses; also DNA tests, microscopes and lasers,\" the newspaper reported.\nIn October 1997, an investigation by the office of Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr reaffirmed that Foster committed suicide, the Post then reported.\n\"The report concludes that Foster was severely depressed about his work at the White House, took a revolver from a closet in his home, placed it in an oven mitt, and on the afternoon of July 20, 1993, drove to a Virginia park and shot himself,\" the story said. \"And it contains new forensic details that refute the conspiracy theories that have long surrounded his death \u2013 that Foster was a victim of foul play, or that his body was moved to Fort Marcy Park after his death at another location, perhaps the White House,\" the story said.\nThe report itself states in its closing summary: \"The available evidence points clearly to suicide as the manner of death.\" The summary also quoted Dr. Alan L. Berman, an expert suicidologist, saying: \"No plausible evidence has been presented to support any other conclusion.\"\nPreviously, the story said, Fiske and two bipartisan congressional panels similarly concluded that Foster took his own life.\nBy email, we\u00a0connected with Berman, who said of Olson\u2019s claim: \"There is not a scintilla of fact in this statement \u2013 it is a blatant falsehood, unsupported and unsupportable. There were four investigations into Foster\u2019s death, all arriving at the same conclusion.\"\nOur ruling\nOlson said Bill Clinton said \"we killed\" Foster.\nThere\u2019s no evidence of Clinton saying as much nor a factual basis for anyone to say the Clintons killed Foster. This claim, which Olson backed off after it became widely known, adds up to a baseless accusation.\nPants on Fire!\n\nPANTS ON FIRE \u2013 The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.
