And it's a terrible thing, but I think the investigation and all the speculation that's happened over the past two years has had a much harsher impact on our democracy than a couple of Facebook ads.\"\nKushner\u2019s entitled to his opinion on impact, but his characterization of Russia\u2019s activity during the 2016 political season is wrong. \"Buying some Facebook ads to try and sow dissent\" is starkly at odds with the U.S. government\u2019s description of the Kremlin\u2019s \"active measures\" campaign, which officials concluded was carried out to help Trump and hurt Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.\nRussia sought to help Trump win the White House\nUltimately, Mueller did not establish there was an illegal relationship between the Trump campaign and Russia. But the notion that Moscow\u2019s efforts amounted to \"a couple of Facebook ads\" is belied by the factual record Mueller compiled, as well as the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s assessment.\nRussia\u2019s active measures campaign comprised two major efforts. The first was a multi-platform social media campaign, which Kushner downplayed as the purchase of \"a couple of Facebook ads.\" The second was the hacking and disseminating of Democratic materials to harm Clinton\u2019s electoral chances.\n\"The investigation established that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome,\" Mueller\u2019s report notes.\nMueller\u2019s conclusion came after the U.S. intelligence community publicly announced a similar conclusion after the 2016 vote.\n\"We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump,\" the Jan. 2017 U.S. intelligence assessment states. \"When it appeared to Moscow that Secretary Clinton was likely to win the election, the Russian influence campaign then focused on undermining her expected presidency.\"\nRussia\u2019s social media campaign\nThe scope of Russia\u2019s social media campaign went vastly further than Kushner\u2019s claim of \"a couple of Facebook ads.\"\nA Kremlin-backed entity called the Internet Research Agency, or IRA, ran the social media campaign out of St. Petersburg, Russia. Mueller found that by the end of the 2016 U.S. election, \"the IRA had the ability to reach millions of U.S. persons through their social media accounts.\"\nThe IRA purchased over 3,500 Facebook advertisements and spent some\u00a0$100,000 on the political ads, the report states. The group also\u00a0controlled multiple Facebook groups and Instagram accounts that \"had hundreds of thousands of U.S. participants,\" Mueller said.\nAbout a year after the election, a Facebook executive told Congress that the IRA controlled some 470 accounts that generated 80,000 posts between January 2015 and August 2017.\nBut the biggest statistic concerns the length of its reach.\n\"Facebook estimated the IRA reached as many as 126 million persons through its Facebook accounts,\" the Mueller report states.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL. Lin Wood\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in an interview with the Patriotically Correct Radio Show\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"China was behind the interference and the effort to overthrow our government and the election, election fraud.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Daniel Funke \u2022 January 19, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheir effort went well beyond Facebook. Additionally, the IRA controlled Twitter accounts with \"tens of thousands of followers,\" Mueller said, adding that among the followers were \"multiple U.S. political figures who retweeted IRA-created content.\"\nTwitter later revealed the IRA controlled more than 3,800 accounts, and likely reached nearly 1.5 million Twitter users.\nRussia\u2019s hack-and-dump operation\nKushner\u2019s description also ignored the Russian intelligence operation to steal and release documents.\nTo help Trump\u2019s odds, Russian hackers controlled by the GRU, Russia's military intelligence service,\u00a0stole emails belonging to Democratic organizations and Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and relayed them to several publishers, including WikiLeaks, Mueller concluded.\nTwo WikiLeaks dumps of damaging Clinton material came at pivotal moments during the campaign.\nIn late July 2016, Democrats selected Clinton as their presidential nominee at the Democratic National Convention. But days before the nominating convention, a ceremony meant to foster party unity, WikiLeaks began publishing stolen Democratic Party emails.\nThe first tranche \u2014 nearly 20,000 emails \u2014 revealed an embarrassing glimpse at internal deliberations among the Democratic National Committee. The correspondence appeared to show the party apparatus conspiring to boost Clinton and undermine her rival Bernie Sanders.\nThe emails sparked Democratic infighting just as the party sought to coalesce support for Clinton.\nThe next big WikiLeaks dump of damaging Clinton information came the month before the election, on Oct. 7.\nThat afternoon, the Washington Post published video of a 2005 interview with Access Hollywood in which Trump boasted that his celebrity status enabled him to grope women.\nLess than an hour after the Trump tape went public, WikiLeaks revealed it had received 50,000 of Podesta\u2019s emails. It released an initial dump of around 2,000 of the Clinton campaign chairman\u2019s messages.\nThe timing of the Podesta email release fueled suspicions that WikiLeaks wanted to distract from the Access Hollywood news. Nearly all of the Mueller report\u2019s findings about WikiLeaks\u2019 role is redacted.\nOur ruling\nKushner said Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election amounted to \"a couple of Facebook ads.\"\nThis claim grossly mischaracterizes Russia\u2019s active measures campaign, which comprised both social media efforts to help Trump\u2019s candidacy and a hack-and-dump operation aimed at hampering Democrats\u2019 electoral chances.\nOn Facebook specifically, the tech company estimates Kremlin-controlled accounts reached as many as 126 million people around the election.\nWe rate this Pants on Fire.\n Share the Facts 2019-04-24 17:19:36 UTC   PolitiFact    1 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Pants on Fire  Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election amounted to \"a couple of Facebook ads.\"    Jared Kushner Senior Adviser to the President https://twitter.com/TIME/status/1120702516814123020?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1120702516814123020&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.npr.org%2F2019%2F04%2F24%2F716374421%2Ffact-check-russian-interference-went-far-beyond-facebook-ads-kushner-described   in an interview Tuesday, April 23, 2019 2019-04-23    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00725"}
