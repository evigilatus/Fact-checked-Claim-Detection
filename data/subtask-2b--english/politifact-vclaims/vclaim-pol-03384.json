Ron Kind, D-La Crosse, said Feb. 16, 2017 on Wisconsin Public Radio. \"To build a wall now would be locking them in this country.\"\nAre there really more illegal Mexican immigrants going than coming?\nResearch backs up claim\nThere are no perfect statistics when it comes to illegal immigration \u2014 it\u2019s inherently impossible to track accurately. But U.S. and Mexican government data analyzed by the Pew Research Center shows the immigration trend reversed in the last decade.\nThe estimated number of Mexicans in the United States illegally rose steadily for many years, from 2.9 million in 1995 to a peak of 6.9 million in 2007. But the number began dropping in 2008 and has fallen more since, reaching 5.8 million in 2014, the latest year for which Pew analyzed data.\nIf the number is falling, that means more illegal Mexican immigrants are leaving the United States than entering it. The numbers include both immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally and those who overstayed their visas.\nAccording to Pew, key factors in the decline are the Great Recession, which meant U.S. job losses in construction and other sectors where Mexican immigrants are likely to work; a rising number of deportations; and increasing numbers of U.S. Border Patrol agents.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImmigration experts from a variety of think tanks said Pew\u2019s research on illegal immigration is well respected and saw no reason to doubt its methodology.\nThe change in migration patterns is also reflected in the number of apprehensions on the Mexican border by the U.S. Border Patrol. About 191,000 Mexicans were apprehended along the southern border in the 2016 fiscal year. At the peak of Mexican immigration in 2007, the Border Patrol apprehended 809,000 Mexicans.\nOverall, illegal immigration was largely static from 2009 to 2014, as the drop in Mexican immigration was mostly offset by an increase from other areas, such as Central America and Asia. (In 2014 the two regions combined for an estimated 3.2 million illegal immigrants, just over half the total from Mexico.)\nThe overall number of illegal immigrants in the United States \u2014 from all countries of origin \u2014 held steady from 2009 to 2014 at around 11 million, Pew estimates.\nIn 2014, the Border Patrol apprehended more non-Mexicans than Mexicans for the first time in at least 60 years, Pew reported. Mexicans still accounted for about 52% of illegal immigration in 2014, though.\nOur rating\nKind said more unauthorized Mexican immigrants are returning to Mexico than coming into the U.S.\nImmigration data gathered by a respected group shows that is an accurate synopsis of the trend since 2007.\nWe rate Kind\u2019s statement True.
