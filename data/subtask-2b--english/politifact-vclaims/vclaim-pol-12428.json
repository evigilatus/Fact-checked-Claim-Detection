Isakson claims competition driving cost for Medicare prescription drug benefit down", "text": "Free-market believers hold the concept as dearly as an article of faith: Competition brings down prices.\n\nSo when U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson, a Republican, declared that competition worked to bring down costs in Medicare\u2019s prescription drug program, he was reciting chapter and verse from the free-market canon.\n\nProgram premiums served as Isakson\u2019s evidence.\n\n\"The premium has gone down almost every year since it was put in place,\" Isakson said in a speech before the Greater North Fulton Chamber of Commerce on Aug. 23.\n\nAlmost every year? We wondered how this was possible. What about all of those complaints about the rising costs of prescription drugs?\n\nMedicare Part D, which started in 2006, is Medicare\u2019s program to help seniors pay for prescription drugs. Policymakers designed it to make private companies compete against one another for customers. They hoped this would pressure plans to keep prices low. \u00a0\n\nIsakson voted to create Medicare Part D in 2003, while he served in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nThis item does not address whether competition caused changes in the program\u2019s premiums. \u00a0Instead, we\u2019ll focus on whether premiums went down.\n\nNow, hold on to your hat. This gets complicated.\n\nWe contacted Isakson\u2019s office for proof that the premium has fallen almost every year.\n\nIsakson press secretary Lauren Culbertson replied with a March 2011 report from the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, or MedPac. It advises the U.S. Congress on issues affecting the Medicare program. She also included information from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, the federal agency that administers the Medicare program.\n\nThese documents contain data for what\u2019s called Medicare Part D\u2019s \"base beneficiary premium.\"\n\nThe \"base beneficiary premium\" is a complicated number. It\u2019s not the actual monthly amount that seniors pay to get basic coverage under the prescription drug program. Those amounts vary widely and seldom equal this figure, the CMS report notes. \u00a0\n\nMedicare calculates the base beneficiary premium using a formula that takes many factors into account. One of them is how much each insurance company bids to provide drug coverage. Another is how many people use each plan. \u00a0\n\nThe data Isakson\u2019s own staff sent us show that the base beneficiary premium actually increased almost every year, with the exceptions of 2007 and projections for 2012.\n\nIn 2006, it was $32.20. In 2007, $27.35; \u00a0in 2008, $27.93; in 2009, $30.36; in 2010, $31.94; in 2011, $32.34. In 2012, it\u2019s projected to be $31.08.\n\nBoston University health care economist Wesley Yin called Isakson\u2019s claim that the premiums mostly fell \"patently wrong.\"\n\nCulbertson, in an email, told us why Isakson made this claim. She said that the senator\u2019s comments were based on the fact that for every year except 2011, the base beneficiary premium was lower than it was in 2006.\n\nThat\u2019s not quite what we think Isakson said, but to give him the benefit of the doubt, we took a closer look.\n\nAs it turns out, this claim is flawed as well. Since 2007, the federal government has adjusted the base beneficiary premium based on how many participants enroll in each plan. This means that a plan with a $20 premium that has 1,000 members would have much more influence on the average than, say, a $200 plan with one member.\n\nIn 2006, the program was brand-new. That year\u2019s figure could not be weighted by enrollment. The MedPac report given to us by Isakson\u2019s office as well as a report from the Congressional Research Service confirmed that these plans were, for the most part, weighted equally.\n\nThis pushed the 2006 figure artificially high, noted Jack Hoadley, a Georgetown University health policy analyst whose research on Medicare Part D is widely used by economists. Since few people picked the higher-price plans, the base beneficiary premium dropped in 2007.\n\nNow, as you\u2019ll recall, the base beneficiary premium does not represent how much money seniors actually pay each month. Hoadley and a team from the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation calculated this amount and found that premiums rose each year. In 2006, it was $25.93. In 2010, the latest year for which data is available, it was $36.90.\n\nThat\u2019s an increase of 42 percent.\n\nWhy did prices creep upward? Hoadley, MedPac and others cite a couple of reasons. Seniors typically stay in their plans, even if they become more expensive. Switching is complicated and the plans are hard to understand, so there\u2019s not as much pressure on health insurers to keep prices down. Also, some of the more popular plans have seen the largest jumps in premiums.\n\nHowever, CMS actually expects base beneficiary premiums to drop in 2012. That\u2019s in part because extremely popular drugs will be available as less-expensive generics. Some have also suggested this is because of competition.\n\nThis means that no matter how you cut it, Isakson\u2019s claim that Medicare Part D\u2019s premium \"has gone down almost every year since it was put in place\" is incorrect. The average cost of premiums that seniors actually pay has risen, as has the base beneficiary premium that Isakson\u2019s staff provided.\n\nFurthermore, using the 2006 base beneficiary premium to assess other years\u2019 figures amounts to comparing apples to oranges. That year, it was not possible to adjust the figure to account for which plans seniors actually chose.\n\nWe presented our evidence to Isakson\u2019s spokeswoman, who reiterated that he based his statement on federal government sources. That might be true, but the senator\u2019s take on the numbers is not.\n\nIsakson earns a False.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-12428"}
