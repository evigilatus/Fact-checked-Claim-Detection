Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., repeated a false claim that 40 percent of guns are sold without a background checks.\n\"We have to end the absurdity of the gun show loophole,\" Sanders said Feb. 18 on NBC\u2019s\u00a0Meet the Press. \"Forty percent of the guns in this country are sold without any background checks.\"\nThree years after we first debunked this statistic, it\u2019s still not true. The statistic comes from a 20-year-old study by the National Institute of Justice that looked at gun owners\u2019 responses to a 1994 national survey asking how they got their weapons.\nThe study found that 30 percent to 40 percent of all gun transactions were made through an \"off-the-books\" transfer in which a background check wasn\u2019t required.\nThe finding has been cited widely by gun control advocates. Former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe earned a Mostly False when he used it, and a Florida gun control advocate earned a False in 2017 after the finding was diminished by new research.\nThe latest research\u00a0suggests the percentage is almost half of what Sanders cited.\nThe sample size of the 1997 study was very small, with just 251 participants. Furthermore, the statistic stems from survey data that included firearms given as gifts or inheritances, not just sales. This is an important point.\nWhen the authors of the NIJ study \u2014 Jens Ludwig of the University of Chicago and Philip Cook of Duke University \u2014 adjusted the results to include only the guns sold (not given), the number sold without background checks declined to between 14 percent and 22 percent.\nThat statistic more closely resembles the new findings in a relatively new 2017 study.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharlie Crist\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2010 in a news release\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Speaker Rubio supported gun restrictions that included background checks and waiting periods.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Lee Logan \u2022 February 26, 2010\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearchers Matthew Miller, Lisa Hepburn, and Deborah Azrael published a study in the January 2017 edition of the journal Annals of Internal Medicine that was specifically undertaken to update the 1994 data.\nThe researchers asked 1,613 adult gun owners where and when they acquired their last firearm, including whether it was purchased, and whether they had either a background check or were asked to show a firearm license or permit.\nThe answer: 22 percent obtained their gun without a background check. That\u2019s about half of the 40 percent figure that has gained wide currency for more than two decades.\nIn fact, Cook wrote an accompanying editorial in the journal, headlined, \"At last, a good estimate of the magnitude of the private-sale loophole for firearms.\"\nIn it, he wrote, \"Even though I bear some credit (or blame) for the earlier estimate, I could not be more pleased to be done with it, given that it is based on data from a survey done more than 20 years ago and that, in any event, never directly asked participants about background checks.\"\n\"It appears the number he cited may be outdated,\" Sanders spokesman Josh Miller-Lewis told PolitiFact Florida in an email. \"But whether it\u2019s 40 percent or 22 percent of guns being acquired without a background check, millions of Americans still obtain guns without background checks. That's absurd. No one should be allowed to purchase a gun without a vigorous background check.\"\nOur ruling\nSanders said, \"Forty percent of the guns in this country are sold without any background checks.\"\nThat statistic is outdated. It stems from \u00a0a 20-year-old survey that has been overtaken by another study that shows that 22 percent of gun buyers obtained their weapons without background checks. That\u2019s just over half the percentage in the zombie claim Sanders cited.\nWe rate this claim False.\n Share the Facts 2018-02-20 22:10:09 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  \"Forty percent of the guns in this country are sold without any background checks.\"    Bernie Sanders U.S. Senator https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/full-sanders-interview-obama-was-in-a-difficult-position-on-russia-1164410435646   in a statement on \"Meet the Press\" Sunday, February 18, 2018 2018-02-18    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02386"}
