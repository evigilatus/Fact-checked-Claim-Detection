One in the country for overdoses of opiates per person. But what about the idea that a single federal seizure of Fentanyl could have killed every West Virginia 32 times? We've had a good look. We told Miller's office that they were referring to 254 pounds of fentanyl seized in late January by customs and border protection at the port of Nogales to enter Arizona. The drugs -- which were \"hiding in a private ground room from a trailer that was loaded with options,\" according to the Agency -- represented the biggest seizure of Fentanyl in the history of the Agency. We also briefed Miller's office on the mathematics they used to get to. The seizure of 254 pounds is 115.2 kg. In contrast, 115.212 kg is 115.212 million mg. Miller's office said that it used 2 milligrams as a lethal dose of fentanyl, citing information from the DEA that 2 milligrams was a \"lethal dose to most people.\" At the same time, 115.212 million milligrams are operated to 57.606 million lethal doses of 2 milligrams each. On January 14, 2021, Chuck Grasley stated in a tweet that insulin prices had \"lost the RoOOF for patients/taxpayers bc from the manufacturer, a health plan and PBM Biz practices.\" By Madison Black: 2 February 2021 West Virginia in 2018, the population of Virginia was 1,805,832. If you divide 57.606 million lethal doses by 1,836,843, that means that the amount of fentanyl can theoretically kill every West Virginia 31.8 times. We're close. This works with 32 times Miller's cited. To ensure that the threshold of 2 milligrams was intact, we checked with Timothy J. Beaver, Director of the Forensic Laboratory of the State Police of New Hampshire, an expert in Fentanyl and his lethality. \"Based on research, toxicology reports and information from other agencies, 2 to 3 milligrams of fentanyl in its purest form can be fatal.\" However, technical details made a difference. For one reason, if you use the threshold of 3 milligrams instead, the Nogales spell would be enough to kill every West Virginia about 21 times more, not 32. There will also be a difference in killing depending on the age, size and health of the individual concerned. In addition, Beaver added that \"it is not clear whether 254 pounds are ventanyl or pure fentanyl that has already been reduced for sale or distribution on the street.\" The average degree of purity would make a difference in his death. Last point: Miller used statistics to support the cause of building a wall on the border between the United States and Mexico. However, fentanyl was seized at one of the ports of entry. The wall will not prevent this type of smuggling through existing checkpoints. Our judgment Miller said, \"Only two weeks ago, customs and border protection took over enough fentanyl to kill everyone in West Virginia 32 times.\" If you consider 2 milligrams a lethal dose -- and that the DEA is doing -- Miller's estimate is very close to correcting it. The only warning is that differences in purity and the potential health and size of the victim can make a difference. However, there is no doubt that the fentanyl of seizure, which has spread equally and effectively across the population, could have killed every resident in West Virginia many times. We're mostly evaluating the statement right.
