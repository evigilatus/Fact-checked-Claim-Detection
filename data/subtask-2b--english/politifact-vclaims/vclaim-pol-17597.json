Roy Cooper had vetoed the GOP-controlled legislature\u2019s budget proposal. On most days, Republicans in the legislature have enough votes for a simple majority \u2014 but not the supermajority needed to override a veto.\u00a0\nBut on the morning of Sept. 11, many Democrats were absent. So House Speaker Tim Moore called a vote and the veto override passed.\nThis is where Rep. Deb Butler comes in. The Wilmington Democrat gained recognition for trying to stop the vote, which she considered improper. (She famously yelled \"I will not yield\" and \"shame on you, Mr. Speaker\" while on the vote was happening.)\nFast forward to January, when the legislature was scheduled to reconvene.\nIn a Jan. 5 tweet, Butler said she\u2019s calling on Senate leader Phil Berger \"who expressed disdain for the ambush vote in the House\" to negotiate with Cooper rather than try to override his veto.\nBerger, like Speaker Moore, is a Republican. It\u2019s uncommon for the two Republican leaders to publicly criticize each other.\nSo we wondered whether Butler was right. Did Berger \"express disdain\" for how Moore executed the veto override?\nLack of evidence\nWe asked Butler where she saw or heard Berger\u2019s supposed disdain.\u00a0\n\"I can\u2019t remember exactly where I read it, but it was in the context of the Senate rules requiring 24 hours notice of a veto override vote and then he said something to the effect that, besides he didn\u2019t like the approach used by the Speaker,\" Butler said. \"I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t remember precisely where.\"\nWe also reached out to Berger\u2019s office and asked whether Berger holds disdain for how the House overrode Cooper\u2019s veto, or whether he ever expressed negative feelings about how it happened.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm not aware of him ever saying anything like that,\" Berger spokesman Pat Ryan said.\nPolitiFact and WRAL reporters could find no specific examples of Berger saying anything negative about the House budget override.\u00a0\nA press conference\nThe closest Berger came to criticizing Moore and the House was during an Oct. 1 press conference. Even then, he didn\u2019t mention Moore specifically or say the House did anything wrong.\nWRAL recorded the press conference. Around the 2:30 mark of the video, Berger talked about his preference for finding a budget solution.\n\"I\u2019d rather have a broad, bipartisan vote \u2014 just like you saw on redistricting \u2014 than a veto override that squeaks through,\" Berger said.\nThen, around the 3:40 mark of the video, Berger explains the logistics of how the Senate must conduct a veto override vote.\n\"Before I take your questions, I\u2019ll answer what\u2019s probably at least one of the questions, maybe the top question: Senate rules require 24 hours\u2019 notice before calendaring a veto override. We will adhere to the rules,\" Berger said. \"I\u2019ll be glad to take your questions.\"\nBerger also said he\u2019d seize an opportunity to pass the budget. If could be argued that promise alone proves he didn\u2019t show disdain for the House vote.\u00a0\nTo disdain something means to feel like it\u2019s \"not good enough to deserve your respect or attention,\" according to the Oxford dictionary. Merriam-Webster says it means to treat something as \"beneath one\u2019s notice or dignity.\"\nOur ruling\nButler said Berger \"expressed disdain\" for how fellow Republicans in the NC House voted to override Cooper\u2019s budget veto. She presented no evidence for her claim and PolitiFact could find no evidence of Berger making any overtly negative comments about the House vote.\nWe rate her claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17597"}
