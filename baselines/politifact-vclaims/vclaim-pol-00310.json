(Think of your son/daughter marrying your cousin's daughter/son.)\n\n\nGiuliani at different points labeled the family connection as \"second cousins once removed\" and \"third cousins,\" before he was corrected, according to news reports.\nIn a 1993 memo for his mayoral campaign, a Giuliani strategist noted the \"weirdness\" factor of the marriage, according to a copy posted on the Smoking Gun Web site. But such a marriage is completely legal. In New York, even first cousins can wed.\nRobin Bennett, senior genetic counselor at the University of Washington, said little scientific research exists about the risk of developmental difficulties for the offspring of second cousins. But she said, \"for second cousins, the risks are likely similar to the risks of couples from the same ethnic population who also may have common ancestors.\"\n\n\nGiuliani and Peruggi did not have any children, and the marriage ended after 14 years.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00310"}
