Trump since his campaigning days \"has flagrantly displayed an anti-Latino, particularly anti-Mexican discriminatory animus,\" Schneiderman said on MSNBC\u2019s The Rachel Maddow Show.\n\"This is a massively successful program. There is no good reason to shut it down. There's no legitimate reason to shut it down. No court has held it unconstitutional,\" Schneiderman said Sept. 6.\nWe\u2019ve heard lots of competing claims from lawmakers, pundits and others that walk the line between fact and opinion regarding the constitutionality of DACA.\nSchneiderman\u2019s claim is clearly stated as a fact. We found that he is right: DACA\u2019s constitutionality has not been determined by courts.\nDACA created by 2012 DHS\u00a0memo\nDACA is based on a June 2012 memorandum issued by Janet Napolitano, then-Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.\nNapolitano\u2019s memo outlined prosecutorial discretion so that resources would be used to remove immigrants who met the department\u2019s priorities and protect from deportation young immigrants who met specific criteria.\nNapolitano said immigration laws were \"not designed to be blindly enforced\" without considering individual cases and circumstances. \"Nor are they designed to remove productive young people to countries where they may not have lived or even speak the language. Indeed, many of these young people have already contributed to our country in significant ways. Prosecutorial discretion, which is used in so many other areas, is especially justified here,\" Napolitano wrote.\nDACA is a policy, but it is not a law. It also does not grant legal immigration status to the approximately 800,000 people who were approved for the program.\nMany have argued that creating DACA through the executive brach, rather than through the legislative process is an overreach of executive power.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo court ruling on constitutionality of DACA\nThere\u2019s debate among experts on whether DACA is constitutional or not, but there is agreement that a court ruling on the constitutionality of the program has not been issued.\n\"There has been no court decision holding that DACA itself is unconstitutional,\" Anil Kalhan, an associate professor of law at Drexel University.\nA lawsuit to challenge the 2012 DACA was dismissed for lack of standing, and that decision was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, Kalhan said. \"So there was never any adjudication on the merits,\" he said.\n\"To my knowledge, no court has ruled DACA 2012 as unconstitutional and the one to even reach the court was dismissed on jurisdictional grounds,\" concurred Shoba Sivaprasad Wadhia, a law professor and director of the Center for Immigrants\u2019 Rights Clinic at Pennsylvania State University. Wadhia and more than 100 other immigration law professors and scholars wrote a letter to Trump providing legal analysis on the executive branch\u2019s legal authority to implement DACA.\nOther experts from the University of California also told us courts have not stricken down DACA as unconstitutional.\n\"It's a straightforward fact that no court has declared DACA unconstitutional and that the one appellate court that considered a related program declined to address the issue,\" said Amy Spitalnick, spokeswoman for Schneiderman.\nTexas and 25 other states won a lawsuit against the Obama administration by having a federal district judge block the implementation of an expanded version of the 2012 DACA and of another deportation reprieve program, Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA). An appeals court upheld the ruling, and in 2016 the Supreme Court ruled 4-4 on the case, leaving in place the lower court's ruling.\nBut when those programs were temporarily enjoined by the district court in Texas, it was not on constitutional grounds, Kalhan said, \"but rather based on a conclusion that Obama administration should have instituted the policy using notice and comment rule-making, rather than using the more informal guidance document that it issued.\"\nA final, binding precedent even on that basis was not set either, since it was only a preliminary injunction and the Supreme Court deadlocked, Kalhan said.\n\"And even then, some aspects of DAPA and the DACA expansion may be different from DACA in relevant ways that bear on legality\u2014it has never been fully established the two programs stand on identical legal footing,\" Kalhan said.\nOur ruling\nSchneiderman said, \"No court has held (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) unconstitutional.\"\nWhile there is debate on the constitutionality of DACA, that has not been determined by courts.\nWe rate Schneiderman\u2019s statement True.\n Share the Facts 2017-09-11 15:03:31 UTC   PolitiFact    6 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: True  https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow/watch/schneiderman-suing-trump-over-daca-cites-discriminatory-animus-1040994371897 \"No court has held (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) unconstitutional.\"     Eric Schneiderman New York Attorney General   in an interview on The Rachel Maddow Show Wednesday, September 6, 2017 2017-09-06    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02921"}
