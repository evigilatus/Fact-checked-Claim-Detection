Do you support the president\u2019s decision to now put 50 special ops forces in Syria and leave 10,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan?\"\nCarson: \"Well, putting the special ops people in there is better than not having them there, because they \u2014 that\u2019s why they\u2019re called special ops, they\u2019re actually able to guide some of the other things that we\u2019re doing there.\n\"And what we have to recognize is that Putin is trying to really spread his influence throughout the Middle East. This is going to be his base. And we have to oppose him there in an effective way.\n\"We also must recognize that it\u2019s a very complex place. You know, the Chinese are there, as well as the Russians, and you have all kinds of factions there.\"\nWe were curious about Carson\u2019s assertion that the \"Chinese are there\" in Syria. According to the White House, China and experts, they are not. But before we dive into that issue, let\u2019s sort out some semantics.\nWhat Carson meant \u00a0\nMultiple media outlets, including our friends at the Washington Post\u2019s Fact Checker, took Carson\u2019s remarks to mean that Chinese troops are in Syria. But the Carson camp forwarded us a statement refuting that interpretation.\nRather, his actual point was that China is providing \"various military weapons and equipment that Syria is using in the current conflict,\" according to the statement which also included several links to articles on that point.\n\"Dr. Carson does not believe that China is currently fighting in or deploying troops to Syria, and contrary to press reports, he has never made that assertion,\" the statement reads. \"Regardless, Dr. Carson's claim that China is exerting its influence and has in the ongoing Syrian conflict is well-supported by evidence, even if it is not evidence commonly available to or easily accessible by journalists without the requisite language skills or knowledge about Chinese.\"\nHowever, Carson seems to be backtracking.\nOn Nov. 11, the day after the debate, a top Carson adviser spoke specifically about \"Chinese military advisers\" in Syria when defending Carson\u2019s remarks.\n\"During Dr. Carson\u2019s conversations with military operatives and people in Iraq, in that part of the world, (they) discussed with him multiple reports that Chinese military advisers are on the ground in Syria operating with Russia (sic) special-operations personnel,\" the adviser told Business Insider.\nA Carson spokesperson also referred the Washington Post\u2019s Fact Checker to a few blog posts speculating explicitly about Chinese military personnel in Syra.\nWe also ran Carson\u2019s statement by an expert on political campaign rhetoric.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Saying \u2018the Chinese are there\u2019 means the Chinese are there, not just that their weapons are there,\" said Kathleen Kendall, a communications professor at the University of Maryland.\n\"He is making a clear, firm assertion. Had he made a more nuanced statement, such as \u2018there is a Chinese influence there,\u2019 there would be some room for debate on his meaning.\"\nNo Chinese in Syria\nWhat\u2019s the source of the idea that China is in Syria? The posts Carson\u2019s spokesperson sent to the Washington Post all link back to a Sept. 27 report from the Lebanon-based news site Al-Masdar Al-\u2019Arabi. According to the news site, a senior officer in the Syrian Arab Army said Chinese military personnel would join Russian marines in the Syria in the next six weeks.\nThe story then got picked up by Russian state media, and the overseas media attention led China's Foreign Ministry to officially deny China\u2019s presence in Syria in mid October, while its state-run media characterized the reports as \"speculative nonsense,\" according to Reuters.\nCarson\u2019s statement also prompted responses from the White House. Press secretary Josh Earnest said he was \"speechless\" over Carson\u2019s claim that he has better intelligence than the administration.\n\"I really can\u2019t speak to what he was referring to, but unless you\u2019re talking about having a diplomatic presence, I\u2019m not sure what he was referencing,\" National Security Adviser Susan Rice said at a press conference. \"I have not seen evidence of Chinese military involvement in Syria.\"\nExperts told us it would be very uncharacteristic for China \u2014 a country with a longstanding, though gradually changing policy of nonintervention \u2014 to send troops abroad, especially to the Middle East.\n\"The Chinese have been very, very clear from day one that Syria is not something they want to take responsibility for,\" said Ian Bremmer, the president of the Eurasia Group, a global consulting firm. \u00a0\"It would go against absolutely everything we know about China. And Syria is the world's worst morass. ... The Chinese want no part of this.\"\n\"There is no possibility that China is planning on sending troops into Syria,\" said Bonnie Glaser, director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"China doesn't send troops abroad except for peacekeeping purposes. China isn't interested in taking on the role of global policeman.\"\nBoth Bremmer and Glaser noted that official Chinese statements on Syria are vague comments promoting peace and self-rule.\n\"China opposes easy interference in other countries' domestic affairs. China supports Syria's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, as well as its approach to find its own path of development that is consistent with its national circumstances,\" China\u2019s Foreign Minister Wang Yi told a visiting Syrian official in mid October.\nThe same sentiment is expressed in a five-point proposal for the Syrian conflict put forward by China during the United Nations\u2019 Geneva II peace conference in 2014, as well as the four-step initiative it offered at the Syria peace talks in Vienna at the end of October 2015.\nThat came as news to Bremmer, who noted he\u2019s not surprised that the neurosurgeon flubbed a statement about foreign policy. Is it possible that some Chinese officials are in Syria discreetly?\n\"There are 1.3 billion Chinese, they're in a lot of places. China\u2019s got an economic interest in Syria obviously, so would I be stunned that there were a couple of Chinese intelligence guys on the ground? No, but they're not playing a military role,\" Bremmer said.\nOur ruling\nCarson said the Chinese have a presence in Syria.\nIn context, Carson\u2019s comments suggested a military presence. That claim appears to be lifted from unconfirmed blog posts and a news report by a Lebanese news site. China and the White House have denied that Chinese troops are in Syria, and experts told us there\u2019s no evidence to the contrary. Even if Carson meant something less than a military presence, China seems to be taking a hands-off approach to the conflict in Syria.\nWe rate Carson\u2019s claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05730"}
