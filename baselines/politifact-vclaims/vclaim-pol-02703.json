But it\u2019s not.\nThe Last Line of Defense published an article on Nov. 4 with the headline, \"UPDATE: Malia Obama among 10 arrested In racist Antifa attack.\" Another fake news site, Info Media, published an identical article that cites The Last Line of Defense as a source at the bottom.\nPopular News Today published a fake article on Nov. 6 that added a plot twist to the original fake news story: \"BREAKING: Cop who arrested Malia Obama found dead under suspicious circumstances.\"\nNone of this is true. The Last Line of Defense is a satirical site that tries to fool conservatives into clicking on false headlines. The author\u2019s work, which we\u2019ve debunked before, often ends up on other fake news sites.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeyond the site\u2019s disclaimer, there are many other ways to show the story is fake.\nThe article says that Malia Obama, and nine other Harvard students, attacked an elderly woman. The Cambridge Police Department daily log, an overview of the department's daily calls for service, does not mention an attack involving 10 assailants, Antifa or any of the names listed in the fake news article.\nThe department\u2019s News & Alerts page also does not have a post announcing the death of an Officer Patrick Farley, Malia\u2019s fake arresting officer.\nThe photo of the police officer used in the Popular News Today fake news article is not a photo of a person named Farley but a photo of Brad Miller, a former police officer in Arlington, Texas. Miller was in the news last year for shooting an unarmed teenager.\nWe rate this narrative Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02703"}
