The article cited data collected by National Education Association, a prominent teachers\u00a0union.\nWe were able to find a more recent figure from the NEA, covering 2017, and by then, West Virginia\u2019s ranking had grown even worse. It fell for the second year in a row, to 49th.\nMeanwhile, we located data from earlier NEA surveys and found that West Virginia hasn\u2019t ranked higher than 44th since 2004.\n\nHowever, we weren\u2019t able to find NEA data online prior to 2003, so we turned instead to data collected by the federal Education Department. This data set goes back to the late 1960s.\nHere\u2019s a chart comparing West Virginia and national teacher salaries at various intervals since the 1969-70 school year. It shows that West Virginia pay has trailed national pay by a fairly consistent margin since at least 2000. It also shows that teacher pay hasn\u2019t kept up with inflation during the last decade.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs for West Virginia\u2019s ranking nationally, it fell precipitously between about 1970 and 1990, then spiked upward before starting to decline again around 2000.\n\n\u00a0\nThis tracks with contemporary news coverage of the 1990 West Virginia teachers\u2019 strike, which came when teacher pay was almost at the bottom of the rankings, according to Education Week.\nIn the 1989-90 school year, the period of the previous strike, West Virginia ranked 48th. To find the state rating roughly 30th in the nation, you have to go back all the way to the late 1960s.\nSo Espinosa has a point that West Virginia teacher pay had sunk to a couple places from the bottom by 2015 \u2014 but he\u2019s exaggerated the heights from which it fell.\nAre the Democrats to blame?\nThis is more of a mixed picture than Espinosa lets on.\nFirst off, the time period is cherry-picked. The legislature had been controlled by the Democrats for decades until the GOP won control in the 2014 elections. By ending his time frame at 2015, Espinosa \u00a0overlooks the period when the GOP controlled the Legislature -- a period in which the state\u2019s teacher pay ranking has fallen, according to the annual NEA data.\nIn addition, the 1990-to-2015 time frame cuts out the governorship of Republican Arch Moore (who served three non-consecutive terms, from 1969 to 1977 and from 1985 to 1989). It also cuts out the current governorship of Jim Justice, who was elected as a Democrat but later switched to the GOP. Currently, Republicans control the governorship as well as both chambers of the legislature.\nAs it happens, the greatest increase in the teacher pay rankings during the period Espinosa cited came between about 1990 and 2000. During most of that period, the state had a Democratic governor, Gaston Caperton. A couple years of that time span were under a Republican governor, Cecil Underwood.\nUltimately, then, the partisan blame does not accrue exclusively to the Democrats.\nOur ruling\nEspinosa said, \"From 1990 to 2015 under (Democratic) control, W. Va. teacher pay rank plummeted from 30th in the nation to 48th.\"\nThere\u2019s no question that West Virginia teacher pay currently ranks near the bottom of the 50 states, but he exaggerated how far those rankings had fallen since 1990. In addition, the biggest rise in pay during that period came during the tenure of a Democratic governor, which undercuts the argument that the Democrats are entirely to blame.\nWe rate the statement Mostly False.\n Share the Facts 2018-12-07 17:34:32 UTC   PolitiFact    3 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly False  \"From 1990 to 2015 under (Democratic) control, W.
