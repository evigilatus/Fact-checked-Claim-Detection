But the soft plastic tank was used by researchers from the National Institute of Agricultural Technology to collect the cow\u2019s burps in order to study the effect its diet had on the production of methane.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 25, 2021 in a video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Bill Gates said \u201cat least 3 billion people need to die\u201d from the planet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Daniel Funke \u2022 January 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, while it is certainly related to the fight against climate change, the bags in the photo were not attached in order to eliminate bovine methane emissions from the atmosphere, but to study the cow\u2019s digestive system and measure the impact of its emissions.\nThen, in 2013, the same researchers used the bags as a collection system to transform and convert the methane into renewable biofuels. One of the project\u2019s technicians, Ricardo Bualo, said in the institute\u2019s report that the purified and compressed biomethane could be used to generate caloric, light and motor energy: \"A cow emits about 300 liters of methane per day, which can be used to operate a 100-liter refrigerator at a temperature between two and six degrees for a full day,\" he says.\nAccording to the Environmental Protection Agency, human activities are responsible for almost all of the increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere over the last 150 years. In 2017, about 9% of U.S. emissions came from the agriculture sector, the agency says.\nSo, yes, scientists are attaching backpacks to cows in order to collect their gas \u2060\u2014 burps, not flatulence \u2060\u2014 and transform it into renewable energy in an attempt to hamper the levels of methane that the animals release.\u00a0\nBut the Facebook post doesn\u2019t explain any of the details of the studies, including the methane\u2019s conversion, and it incorrectly pegs scientists and researchers as \"fringe leftists.\"\u00a0\nThe post contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.
