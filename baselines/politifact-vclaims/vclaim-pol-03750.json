And it was an extraordinary poll.\"\nSo, is he right? We took a closer look.\nWhen we contacted the White House, they told us that the poll in question was the Politico/Morning Consult poll released on Jan. 25, five days after the inauguration. The poll surveyed 1,922 registered voters, with a sampling margin of error of plus or minus two percentage points.\nThe relevant question was, \"Based on what you have seen, read or heard recently about Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration speech, would you say it was excellent, good, only fair or poor?\" The question was only asked of the 1,762 people who said they watched the address, which the pollster said was \"a sample that\u2019s slightly more Republican than the overall poll, although (it) still skews Democratic.\"\nThe results? A plurality -- 49 percent -- thought Trump\u2019s speech was \"excellent\" or \"good.\" By comparison, 39 percent thought the speech was either fair or poor.\nSo, Trump has a point: In isolation, at least, that\u2019s a pretty good score. It\u2019s also a similar result to another poll that asked essentially the same question.\nGallup asked, \"Based on what you have heard or read, how would you rate Donald Trump's inauguration speech? Would you rate it as -- excellent, good, just okay, poor or terrible?\" Gallup surveyed 508 adults, with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus five percentage points.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe poll found that 53 percent thought the speech was \"excellent\" or \"good,\" while 42 percent thought it was \"just okay,\" \"poor,\" or \"terrible.\"\nSo both surveys found positive responses outpacing negative responses by about 10 percentage points, with positive responses accounting for either a majority or nearly a majority.\nThe one caveat we\u2019ll mention is that Trump\u2019s showing wasn\u2019t as positive as that of other recent presidents.\nGallup has asked this question for the previous three inaugural addresses -- George W. Bush\u2019s in 2005 and Barack Obama\u2019s in 2009 and 2013.\nTrump\u2019s \"excellent plus good\" score of 53 percent trailed all three. The score for Bush in 2005 was 62 percent, while Obama received 81 percent in 2009 and 65 percent in 2013. In addition, Trump got the worst-ever \"terrible\" score -- 14 percent, which was twice as high as the previous record, for Obama\u2019s second inaugural speech.\nOur ruling\nTrump said, \"A poll just came out on my inauguration speech. \u2026 People loved it. Loved and liked.\"\nHe has a point that in both the Politico/Morning Consult poll and the Gallup poll, favorable opinions outpaced unfavorable opinions by double-digit margins. However, it\u2019s worth noting that Trump\u2019s positive score in the Gallup poll was between 9 and 28 points lower than the scores in the previous three inaugural addresses.
