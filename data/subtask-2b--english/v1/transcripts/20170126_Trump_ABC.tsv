0001	David Muir	Mr. President, I know you're only five days in.
0002	David Muir	Has it changed you?
0003	Donald Trump	I don't want to change too much.
0004	Donald Trump	I've had a wonderful life and wonderful success.
0005	Donald Trump	I want to make this a great success for the American people and for the people that put me in this position.
0006	Donald Trump	So I don't want to change too much.
0007	Donald Trump	I can be the most presidential person ever, other than possibly the great Abe Lincoln, all right?
0008	Donald Trump	But I can be the most presidential person.
0009	Donald Trump	But I may not be able to do the job nearly as well if I do that.
0010	David Muir	Your predecessor used to talk often about finishing the day to get to his family upstairs  the stairwell's right over here  to have dinner with them.
0011	David Muir	And I know that the first lady, Melania, has a big job back in New York taking care of Barron.
0012	Donald Trump	She does, yes.
0013	David Muir	Does it make it a lonely place for you at the end of the day?
0014	Donald Trump	No, because I end up working longer.
0015	Donald Trump	And that's OK.
0016	Donald Trump	I  I mean, I'm working long hours.
0017	Donald Trump	I mean, the country has a lot of problems.
0018	SYSTEM	[Voiceover]
0019	Donald Trump	He says a lot of problems, and President Trump tonight on the controversial moves he's made already.
0020	David Muir	Mr. President, I want to start  we're five days in.
0021	David Muir	And your campaign promises, I know today you plan on signing the order to build the wall.
0022	Donald Trump	Correct.
0023	David Muir	Are you going to direct U.S. funds to pay for this wall?
0024	David Muir	Will American taxpayers pay for the wall?
0025	Donald Trump	Ultimately, it'll come out of what's happening with Mexico.
0026	Donald Trump	We're going to be starting those negotiations relatively soon.
0027	Donald Trump	And we will be in a form reimbursed by Mexico, which I've always said...
0028	David Muir	So they'll pay us back?
0029	Donald Trump	Yeah, absolutely, 100 percent, yes.
0030	David Muir	So the American taxpayer will pay for the wall at first?
0031	Donald Trump	All it is, is we'll be reimbursed at a later date from whatever transaction we make from Mexico.
0032	Donald Trump	Now, I could wait a year and I could hold off the wall.
0033	Donald Trump	But I want to build the wall.
0034	Donald Trump	We have to build the wall.
0035	Donald Trump	We have to stop drugs from pouring in.
0036	Donald Trump	We have to stop people from just pouring into our country.
0037	Donald Trump	We have no idea where they're from.
0038	Donald Trump	And I campaigned on the wall.
0039	Donald Trump	And it's very important.
0040	Donald Trump	But that wall will cost us nothing.
0041	David Muir	But you talked often about Mexico paying for the wall.
0042	David Muir	And you, again, say they'll pay us back.
0043	David Muir	Mexico's president said in recent days that Mexico absolutely will not pay, adding that, It goes against our dignity as a country and our dignity as Mexicans."
0044	David Muir	He says
0045	Donald Trump	Well, I think he has  David, I think he has to say that.
0046	Donald Trump	He has to say that.
0047	Donald Trump	But I'm just telling you, there will be a payment.
0048	Donald Trump	It will be in a form, perhaps a complicated form.
0049	Donald Trump	And you have to understand, what I'm doing is good for the United States.
0050	Donald Trump	It's also going to be good for Mexico.
0051	David Muir	What are you going to say to some of your supporters who might say, Wait a minute
0052	Donald Trump	Well, I'd say very simply that they are going to pay for it.
0053	Donald Trump	I never said they're going to pay from the start.
0054	Donald Trump	I said Mexico will pay for the wall.
0055	David Muir	When does construction begin?
0056	Donald Trump	As soon as we can.
0057	Donald Trump	As soon as we can physically do it, we're  we're...
0058	David Muir	Within months?
0059	Donald Trump	I would say in months, yeah.
0060	Donald Trump	I would say in months.
0061	Donald Trump	Certainly, planning is starting immediately.
0062	David Muir	I want to ask about undocumented immigrants who are here in this country.
0063	David Muir	Right now, they're protected as socalled Dreamers, the children who were brought here, as you know, by their parents.
0064	David Muir	Should they be worried that they could be deported?
0065	David Muir	And is there anything you can say to assure them right now that they'll be allowed to stay?
0066	Donald Trump	They shouldn't be very worried.
0067	Donald Trump	They are here illegally.
0068	Donald Trump	They shouldn't be very worried.
0069	Donald Trump	I do have a big heart.
0070	Donald Trump	We're going to take care of everybody.
0071	Donald Trump	We're going to have a very strong border.
0072	Donald Trump	We're going to have a very solid border.
0073	Donald Trump	Where you have great people that are here that have done a good job, they should be far less worried.
0074	Donald Trump	We'll be coming out with policy on that over the next period of four weeks.
0075	David Muir	So, Mr. President, will they be allowed to stay?
0076	Donald Trump	I'm going to tell you over the next four weeks.
0077	David Muir	I want to ask you about something you said this week right here at the White House.
0078	David Muir	You brought in congressional leaders to the White House.
0079	David Muir	You spoke at length about the presidential election with them, telling them that you lost the popular vote because of millions of illegal votes, 3 million to 5 million illegal votes.
0080	David Muir	That would be the biggest electoral fraud in American history.
0081	David Muir	Where is the evidence of that?
0082	Donald Trump	So, let me tell you, first of all, it was so misrepresented.
0083	Donald Trump	That was supposed to be a confidential meeting.
0084	Donald Trump	And you weren't supposed to go out and talk to the press as soon as you  but the Democrats viewed it not as a confidential meeting.
0085	SYSTEM	[Crosstalk]
0086	David Muir	But you have tweeted about the millions of illegal...
0087	Donald Trump	Let me  sure.
0088	Donald Trump	And I do  and I'm very  and I mean it.
0089	Donald Trump	But just so you know, it was supposed to be a confidential meeting.
0090	Donald Trump	They turned it into not a  number two, the conversation lasted for about a minute.
0091	Donald Trump	They made it  somebody said it was, like, 25 percent of the  it wasn't.
0092	Donald Trump	It was hardly even discussed.
0093	Donald Trump	I said it.
0094	Donald Trump	And I said it strongly, because what's going on with voter fraud is horrible.
0095	Donald Trump	That's number one.
0096	Donald Trump	Number two, I would've won the popular vote if I was campaigning for the popular vote.
0097	Donald Trump	I would've gone to California, where I didn't go at all.
0098	Donald Trump	I would've gone to New York, where I didn't campaign at all.
0099	Donald Trump	I would've gone to a couple of places that I didn't go to.
0100	Donald Trump	And I would've won that much easier than winning the Electoral College.
0101	Donald Trump	But as you know, the Electoral College is all that matters.
0102	Donald Trump	It doesn't make any difference.
0103	Donald Trump	With that being said, if you look at voter registration, you look at the dead people that are registered to vote who vote, you look at people that are registered in two states, you look at all of these different things that are happening with registration, you take a look at those registration for  you're going to find  and we're going to do an investigation on it...
0104	David Muir	But three to five million illegal votes?
0105	Donald Trump	Well, we're going to find out.
0106	Donald Trump	But it could very well be that much.
0107	Donald Trump	You have people that are registered who are dead, who are illegals, who are in two states.
0108	Donald Trump	You have people registered in two states.
0109	Donald Trump	They're registered in a New York and a New Jersey.
0110	Donald Trump	They vote twice.
0111	Donald Trump	There are millions of votes, in my opinion.
0112	Donald Trump	Now...
0113	MUIR	But again...
0114	Donald Trump	I'm going to do an investigation.
0115	Donald Trump	Now, David, David...
0116	David Muir	You're now president of the United States.
0117	Donald Trump	I'm  well, of course.
0118	Donald Trump	I want the voting process to be legitimate.
0119	David Muir	But what I'm asking  what I'm asking...
0120	Donald Trump	People that...
0121	David Muir	When you say in your opinion millions of illegal votes, that is something that is extremely fundamental to our functioning democracy, a fair and free election.
0122	Donald Trump	Sure.
0123	Donald Trump	Sure.
0124	Donald Trump	Sure.
0125	David Muir	You say you're going to launch an investigation.
0126	Donald Trump	Sure.
0127	Donald Trump	Done.
0128	David Muir	What you have presented so far has been debunked.
0129	David Muir	It's been called false.
0130	Donald Trump	No, it hasn't.
0131	Donald Trump	Take a look at the Pew reports.
0132	David Muir	I called the author of the Pew report last night.
0133	David Muir	And he told me that they found no evidence of voter fraud.
0134	Donald Trump	Really?
0135	Donald Trump	Then why did he write the report?
0136	David Muir	He said no evidence of voter fraud.
0137	Donald Trump	Excuse me.
0138	Donald Trump	Then why did he write the report?
0139	David Muir	So I guess I'm...
0140	Donald Trump	According to Pew report.
0141	Donald Trump	Then he's  then he's groveling again.
0142	Donald Trump	You know, I always talk about the reporters that grovel when they want to write something that you want to hear, but not necessarily millions of people want to hear, or have to hear.
0143	Donald Trump	This is...
0144	David Muir	So you've launched an investigation?
0145	Donald Trump	We're going to launch an investigation to find out.
0146	Donald Trump	And then the next time  and  and I will say this.
0147	Donald Trump	Of those votes cast, none of them come to me.
0148	Donald Trump	None of them come to me.
0149	Donald Trump	They would all be for the other side.
0150	Donald Trump	None of them come to me.
0151	Donald Trump	But when you look at the people that are registered dead, illegal, and two states.
0152	Donald Trump	And some cases, maybe three states?
0153	Donald Trump	We have a lot to look into.
0154	David Muir	House Speaker Paul Ryan has said, I have seen no evidence.
0155	David Muir	I have made this very
0156	Donald Trump	There's nothing bigger.
0157	Donald Trump	There's nothing bigger.
0158	David Muir	But it is important, because you have...
0159	Donald Trump	Well, let me just tell you, you know what's important?
0160	Donald Trump	Millions of people agree with me when I say that.
0161	Donald Trump	If you would have looked on one of the other networks and all of the people that were calling in, they're saying, We agree with Mr. Trump.
0162	Donald Trump	We agree."
0163	Donald Trump	They're very smart people.
0164	Donald Trump	ell
0165	David Muir	Let me just ask you, you did win.
0166	David Muir	You're the president.
0167	David Muir	You're sitting across from me right now.
0168	Donald Trump	That's true.
0169	Donald Trump	That's true.
0170	David Muir	Do you think that your words matter more now?
0171	Donald Trump	Yes, very much.
0172	David Muir	Do you think that  that talking about millions of illegal votes is dangerous to this country...
0173	Donald Trump	No, not at all.
0174	David Muir	... without presenting the evidence?
0175	Donald Trump	Not at all.
0176	Donald Trump	Because many people feel the same way that I do.
0177	Donald Trump	And...
0178	David Muir	You don't think it undermines your credibility if there's no evidence?
0179	Donald Trump	No, not at all.
0180	Donald Trump	Because they wouldn't  they didn't come to me, believe me.
0181	Donald Trump	Those were Hillary votes.
0182	David Muir	Mr. President, I just have one more question on this.
0183	Donald Trump	Yes.
0184	David Muir	And it's  it's  it's bigger picture.
0185	David Muir	You  you took some heat  after your visit to the CIA, in front of that hallowed wall, 117 stars  of those lost at the CIA, you talked about other things, but you also talked about crowd size at the inauguration, about the size of your rallies, about covers on Time magazine.
0186	David Muir	And I just want to ask you, when does all of that matter just a little less?
0187	David Muir	When do you let it roll off your back now that you're the president?
0188	Donald Trump	OK, so I'm glad you asked.
0189	Donald Trump	So I went to the CIA, my first stop.
0190	Donald Trump	I have great respect for the people in intelligence and CIA.
0191	Donald Trump	I don't have a lot of respect for in particular one of the leaders.
0192	Donald Trump	But that's OK.
0193	Donald Trump	But I have a lot of respect for the people in the CIA.
0194	Donald Trump	That speech was a homerun.
0195	Donald Trump	That speech, if you look at Fox, OK, I'll mention your network  read  see what Fox said.
0196	Donald Trump	They said it was one of the great speeches.
0197	Donald Trump	They showed the people applauding and screaming and  and they were all CIA.
0198	Donald Trump	There was nobody  somebody was asking Sean, Well
0199	David Muir	And you would give the same speech if you went back?
0200	Donald Trump	Absolutely.
0201	David Muir	In front of that wall?
0202	Donald Trump	It was great.
0203	Donald Trump	People loved it.
0204	Donald Trump	They loved it.
0205	Donald Trump	They gave me a standing ovation for a long period of time.
0206	Donald Trump	They never even sat down, most of them, during the speech.
0207	Donald Trump	There was love in the room.
0208	Donald Trump	You and other networks covered it very inaccurately.
0209	Donald Trump	I hate to say this to you, and you probably won't put it on, but turn on Fox and see how it was covered and see how people respond to that speech.
0210	Donald Trump	That speech was a good speech.
0211	Donald Trump	And you and a couple of other networks tried to downplay that speech.
0212	Donald Trump	And it was very, very unfortunate that you did.
0213	David Muir	I am curious about the first full day here at the White House, choosing to send the press secretary out into the briefing room, summoning reporters to talk about the inaugural crowd size.
0214	David Muir	Does that send a message to the American people that that's  that's more important than some of the very pressing issues?
0215	Donald Trump	Part of my whole victory was that the men and women of this country who have been forgotten will never be forgotten again.
0216	Donald Trump	Part of that is when they try and demean me unfairly  because we had a massive crowd of people  we  we had a crowd  I looked over that sea of people and I said to myself, Wow."
0217	Donald Trump	And I've seen crowds before.
0218	Donald Trump	Big
0219	Donald Trump	When I looked at the numbers that happened to come in from all of the various sources, we had the biggest audience in the history of inaugural speeches.
0220	Donald Trump	I said, the men and women that I was talking to who came out and voted will never be forgotten again.
0221	Donald Trump	Therefore, I won't allow you or other people like you to demean that crowd and to demean the people that came to Washington, D.C., from faraway places because they like me.
0222	Donald Trump	But more importantly, they like what I'm saying.
0223	SYSTEM	[Voiceover]
0224	Donald Trump	When we come back, what the president revealed to us about torture and waterboarding.
0225	David Muir	You're now the president.
0226	David Muir	Do you want waterboarding?
0227	SYSTEM	[Voiceover]
0228	David Muir	What President Trump is now saying tonight, already generating headlines.
0229	David Muir	And our walk through the White House.
0230	David Muir	What it was like being handed the nuclear codes.
0231	David Muir	And his new office.
0232	David Muir	So we're in the Oval Office.
0233	Donald Trump	This is the Oval Office.
0234	SYSTEM	[Voiceover]
0235	Donald Trump	What he shows us, and a letter President Obama left for President Trump, when we come back.
0236	SYSTEM	[Commercial Break]
0237	David Muir	Mr. Trump, let's talk about many of the things that have happened this week.
0238	David Muir	Chicago, last night, you tweeted about the murder rate in Chicago, saying, If Chicago doesn't fix the horrible carnage going on
0239	Donald Trump	Right.
0240	David Muir	You will send in the feds.
0241	David Muir	What do you mean by that?
0242	Donald Trump	It's carnage.
0243	Donald Trump	You know, in my speech, I got tremendous  from certain people, the word carnage.
0244	Donald Trump	It is carnage.
0245	Donald Trump	It's horrible carnage.
0246	Donald Trump	This is  Afghanistan is not like what's happening in Chicago.
0247	Donald Trump	People are being shot left and right.
0248	Donald Trump	Thousands of people over a period  over a short period of time.
0249	Donald Trump	This year, which has just started, is worse than last year, which was a catastrophe.
0250	Donald Trump	They're not doing the job.
0251	Donald Trump	Now, if they want help, I would love to help them.
0252	Donald Trump	I will send in what we have to send in.
0253	Donald Trump	Maybe they're not going to have to be so politically correct.
0254	Donald Trump	Maybe they're being overly political correct?
0255	Donald Trump	Maybe there's something going on?
0256	Donald Trump	But you can't have those killings going on in Chicago.
0257	Donald Trump	Chicago is like a warzone.
0258	Donald Trump	Chicago is worse than some of the people that you report, in some of the places that you report about every night, in the Middle East.
0259	David Muir	So I will  you mention federal assistance.
0260	David Muir	There's federal assistance, and then there's sending in the feds.
0261	David Muir	I'm just curious, will you take action on your own?
0262	Donald Trump	I want them to fix the problem.
0263	Donald Trump	You can't have thousands of people being shot in a city, in a country that I happen to be president of.
0264	Donald Trump	Maybe it's OK if somebody else is president.
0265	Donald Trump	I want them to fix the problem.
0266	Donald Trump	They have a problem that's very easily fixable.
0267	Donald Trump	They're going to have to get tougher and stronger and smarter, but they got to fix the problem.
0268	Donald Trump	I don't want to have thousands of people shot in a city where, essentially, I'm the president.
0269	Donald Trump	I love Chicago.
0270	Donald Trump	I know Chicago.
0271	Donald Trump	And Chicago is a great city.
0272	Donald Trump	It can be a great city.
0273	Donald Trump	It can't be a great city if people are shot walking down the street for a loaf of bread.
0274	Donald Trump	It can't be a great city.
0275	David Muir	And if they are unable to fix it, that's when you would send in the feds?
0276	Donald Trump	Well, so far they have been unable  it's been going on for years.
0277	Donald Trump	And I wasn't president.
0278	Donald Trump	What's going on?
0279	Donald Trump	So all I'm saying is, to the mayor, who came up to my office recently, I say, you have to smarten up and you have to toughen up.
0280	Donald Trump	Because you can't let that happen.
0281	Donald Trump	That's a warzone.
0282	David Muir	This is a warning.
0283	Donald Trump	I want them to straighten out the problem.
0284	Donald Trump	It's a big problem.
0285	David Muir	Let me ask you about a new report that you are poised to lift a ban on socalled CIA black sites, prisons around the world that have been used in the past.
0286	David Muir	Is that true?
0287	Donald Trump	Well, I'll be talking about that in about two hours.
0288	David Muir	Are you going to lift the ban?
0289	Donald Trump	You're going to see in about two hours.
0290	SYSTEM	[Voiceover]
0291	Donald Trump	Tonight, we are still waiting for word from the Trump White House on any decision involving those socalled black sites.
0292	David Muir	The last president, President Obama, said the U.S. does not torture.
0293	David Muir	Will you say that?
0294	Donald Trump	Well, I have a general who I have great respect for, General Mattis, who said  I was a little surprised  who said he's not a believer in torture.
0295	Donald Trump	As you know, Mr. Pompeo was just approved, affirmed by the Senate.
0296	Donald Trump	He's a fantastic guy.
0297	Donald Trump	He's going to be the head of the CIA.
0298	Donald Trump	And you will have somebody fabulous, as opposed to the character that just got out who didn't  was not fabulous at all.
0299	Donald Trump	And he will, I think, do a great job.
0300	Donald Trump	And he is, you know  I haven't gone into great detail, but I will tell you, I have spoken to others in intelligence and they are big believers in, as an example, waterboarding.
0301	David Muir	You did tell me...
0302	Donald Trump	Because they say it does work.
0303	Donald Trump	It does work.
0304	David Muir	Mr. President...
0305	Donald Trump	Now, personally...
0306	David Muir	Mr. President, you told me during one of the debates that you would bring back waterboarding and a hell of a lot worse, in your words.
0307	Donald Trump	Yeah.
0308	Donald Trump	I would do  what I would do  I want to keep our country safe.
0309	Donald Trump	I want to keep our country safe.
0310	David Muir	What does that mean?
0311	Donald Trump	When they're shooting, when they're chopping off the heads of our people and other people, when they are chopping off the heads of people because they happen to be a Christian in the Middle East, when ISIS is doing things that nobody has ever heard of since medieval times, would I feel strongly about waterboarding?
0312	Donald Trump	As far as I'm concerned, we have to fight fire with fire.
0313	Donald Trump	Now, with that being said, I'm going with General Mattis.
0314	Donald Trump	I'm going with my secretary, because I think Pompeo is going to be phenomenon.
0315	Donald Trump	I'm going to go with what they say.
0316	Donald Trump	But I have spoken, as recently as 24 hours ago, with people at the highest level of intelligence, and I asked them the question.
0317	Donald Trump	Does it work?
0318	Donald Trump	Does torture work?
0319	Donald Trump	And the answer was Yes, absolutely.
0320	David Muir	You're now the president.
0321	David Muir	Do you want waterboarding?
0322	Donald Trump	I don't want people to chop off the citizens' or anybody's heads in the Middle East, OK?
0323	Donald Trump	Because they're Christian or Muslim or anything else.
0324	Donald Trump	I don't want  look, you are old enough to have seen a time that was much different.
0325	Donald Trump	You never saw heads chopped off until a few years ago.
0326	Donald Trump	Now they chop them off, and they put them on camera, and they send them all over the world.
0327	Donald Trump	So we have that.
0328	Donald Trump	And we're not allowed to do anything.
0329	Donald Trump	We're not playing on an even field.
0330	Donald Trump	I will say this.
0331	Donald Trump	I will rely on Pompeo and Mattis and my group.
0332	Donald Trump	And if they don't want to do, that's fine.
0333	Donald Trump	If they do want to do, then I will work toward that end.
0334	Donald Trump	I want to do everything within the bounds of what you're allowed to do legally.
0335	Donald Trump	But do I feel it works?
0336	Donald Trump	Absolutely, I feel it works.
0337	David Muir	So you'd be OK with that as president?
0338	Donald Trump	I want to keep  no, I want to  no, I will rely on General Mattis, and I am going to rely on those two people and others.
0339	Donald Trump	And if they don't want to do it, it's 100 percent OK with me.
0340	Donald Trump	Do I think it works?
0341	Donald Trump	Absolutely.
0342	SYSTEM	[Voiceover]
0343	Donald Trump	We head outside to the colonnade where we discussed what happened shortly after President Trump took the oath of office.
0344	David Muir	This is the famous walk you've seen so many presidents...
0345	Donald Trump	Right, so many.
0346	Donald Trump	It's amazing.
0347	David Muir	Let me ask you.
0348	David Muir	Right after the oath of office, they give you the nuclear codes, the biscuit."
0349	David Muir	Sobering moment?
0350	David Muir	et me ask you.
0351	David Muir	Right after the"
0352	Donald Trump	When they explained what it represents and the kind of destruction that you're talking about, it is a very sobering moment, yes.
0353	Donald Trump	It's very, very  very scary, in a sense.
0354	David Muir	Does it keep you up at night?
0355	Donald Trump	No.
0356	Donald Trump	But it's  confident that I'll do the right thing.
0357	Donald Trump	The right job.
0358	Donald Trump	But it's a very, very scary thing.
0359	David Muir	Every president does get asked, though, what keeps them awake, what's unsettling.
0360	David Muir	What has been most unsettling for you now that you're five days in?
0361	Donald Trump	Well, I think I see a tremendous amount of waste.
0362	Donald Trump	I see a tremendous amount of job opportunities that have been let go for many years, and I'm not just talking about President Obama.
0363	Donald Trump	I'm talking about for many, many years.
0364	Donald Trump	And I was a big, big fan of Ronald Reagan, but I was a never big fan on trade with respect to Ronald Reagan.
0365	David Muir	So the economy...
0366	Donald Trump	I just think we've had years and years of allowing our jobs to be dissipated in this country, and there's no reason for it.
0367	David Muir	So the economy keeps you up more than terrorism and homeland security?
0368	Donald Trump	I view it all the same.
0369	David Muir	You do?
0370	David Muir	Donald Trump
0371	SYSTEM	[Voiceover]
0372	David Muir	When we come back, what the president says about plans for sweeping executive action suspending immigration from certain countries.
0373	David Muir	Is this the Muslim ban?
0374	SYSTEM	[Voiceover]
0375	David Muir	And here at home, we ask the president about the millions of Americans who are concerned they could lose their health care if Obamacare is repealed.
0376	David Muir	Can you assure those Americans watching this right now that they will not lose their health insurance or end up with anything less?
0377	SYSTEM	[Voiceover]
0378	David Muir	And the March, the more than a million protesters, women, men, children, across this country, we ask what the president would say to them tonight.
0379	SYSTEM	[Commercial Break]
0380	David Muir	Mr. President, I want to ask you about refugees.
0381	David Muir	You're about to sign a sweeping executive action to suspend immigration to this country.
0382	Donald Trump	Right.
0383	David Muir	Who are we talking about?
0384	David Muir	Is this the Muslim ban?
0385	Donald Trump	We're talking about  no, it's not the Muslim ban, but it's countries that have tremendous terror.
0386	Donald Trump	And it's countries that people are going to come in and cause us tremendous problems.
0387	Donald Trump	Our country has enough problems without allowing people to come in, who in many cases, or in some cases, are looking to do tremendous destruction.
0388	David Muir	Which countries are we talking about?
0389	Donald Trump	You look at what's happened  I have a whole list.
0390	Donald Trump	You will be very thrilled.
0391	Donald Trump	You're looking at people that come in, in many cases, in some cases with evil intentions.
0392	Donald Trump	I don't want that.
0393	Donald Trump	They're ISIS.
0394	Donald Trump	They're coming under false pretense.
0395	Donald Trump	I don't want that.
0396	Donald Trump	I'm going to be the president of a safe country.
0397	Donald Trump	We have enough problems.
0398	Donald Trump	Now, I'll absolutely do safe zones in Syria for the people.
0399	Donald Trump	I think that Europe has made a tremendous mistake by allowing these millions of people to go into Germany and various other countries.
0400	Donald Trump	And all you have to do is take a look.
0401	Donald Trump	It's  it's a disaster what's happening over there.
0402	Donald Trump	I don't want that to happen here.
0403	Donald Trump	Now, with that being said, President Obama and Hillary Clinton have a  and Kerry  have allowed tens of thousands of people into our country.
0404	Donald Trump	The FBI is now investigating more people than ever before having to do with terror.
0405	Donald Trump	They  and it's from the group of people that came in.
0406	Donald Trump	So, look, look, our country has a lot of problems, believe me.
0407	Donald Trump	I know what the problems are even better than you do.
0408	Donald Trump	They're deep problems.
0409	Donald Trump	They're serious problems.
0410	Donald Trump	We don't need more. Let me ask you about some of the countries that won't be on the list Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia...
0411	SYSTEM	[Crosstalk]
0412	Donald Trump	You're going to see.
0413	Donald Trump	You're going to see.
0414	Donald Trump	We're going to have extreme vetting in all cases.
0415	Donald Trump	And I mean extreme.
0416	Donald Trump	And we're not letting people in if we think there's even a little chance of some problem.
0417	David Muir	Are you at all...
0418	Donald Trump	Because we are  we are excluding certain countries, but for other countries, we're going to have extreme vetting.
0419	Donald Trump	It's going to be very hard to come in.
0420	Donald Trump	Right now, it's very easy to come in.
0421	Donald Trump	It's going to be very, very hard.
0422	Donald Trump	I don't want terror in this country.
0423	Donald Trump	You look at what happened in San Bernardino.
0424	Donald Trump	You look at what happened all over.
0425	Donald Trump	You look at what happened in the World Trade Center, OK?
0426	Donald Trump	I mean, take that as an example.
0427	Donald Trump	People don't even bring that up.
0428	David Muir	Are you at all concerned  are you at all concerned it's going to cause more anger among Muslims around the world?
0429	Donald Trump	Anger?
0430	Donald Trump	There's plenty of anger right now.
0431	Donald Trump	How can you have more?
0432	David Muir	You don't think it will exacerbate the problem?
0433	Donald Trump	Look, look, David, David, I mean, I know you're a sophisticated guy.
0434	Donald Trump	The world is a mess.
0435	Donald Trump	The world is as angry as it gets.
0436	Donald Trump	What, you think this is going to cause a little more anger?
0437	Donald Trump	The world is an angry place.
0438	Donald Trump	All of this has happened.
0439	Donald Trump	We went into Iraq.
0440	Donald Trump	We shouldn't have gone into Iraq.
0441	Donald Trump	We shouldn't have gotten out the way we got out.
0442	Donald Trump	The world is a total mess.
0443	Donald Trump	The world is a mess, David.
0444	David Muir	You brought up Iraq and something you said that could affect American troops in recent days.
0445	David Muir	You said, We should have kept the oil
0446	Donald Trump	Well, we should have kept the oil when we got out.
0447	Donald Trump	And you know, it's very interesting.
0448	Donald Trump	Had we taken the oil, you wouldn't have ISIS, because they fuel themselves with the oil.
0449	Donald Trump	That's where they got the money.
0450	David Muir	So you believe we can go in and take the oil?
0451	Donald Trump	We should have taken the oil.
0452	Donald Trump	You wouldn't have ISIS if we took the oil.
0453	David Muir	You've heard the critics who say that would break all international law, taking the oil.
0454	David Muir	But I want to get to the words that you said...
0455	Donald Trump	Can you believe that?
0456	Donald Trump	Wait a minute.
0457	Donald Trump	Can you believe that?
0458	Donald Trump	Who are the critics that say that?
0459	Donald Trump	Fools.
0460	Donald Trump	I don't call them critics.
0461	Donald Trump	I call them fools.
0462	David Muir	Let me talk about your words...
0463	Donald Trump	We should have kept  excuse me.
0464	Donald Trump	We should have taken the oil.
0465	Donald Trump	And if we took the oil, you wouldn't have ISIS, and we would have had wealth.
0466	Donald Trump	We have spent, right now, $6 trillion in the Middle East, and our country is falling apart.
0467	Donald Trump	It's not right.
0468	David Muir	What got my attention, Mr. President, was when you said maybe we'll have another chance.
0469	Donald Trump	Well, don't let it get your attention too much, because we'll see what happens.
0470	Donald Trump	I mean, we're going to see what happens.
0471	Donald Trump	You know, I told you and I told everybody else that wants to talk, when it comes to the military, I don't want to discuss things.
0472	Donald Trump	I want to let  I want to let the action take place before the talk takes place.
0473	Donald Trump	I watched in Mosul, when  a number of months ago, generals and politicians would get up and say, we're going into Mosul in four months.
0474	Donald Trump	Then they'd say we're going in, in three months, two months, one month, we're going in next week.
0475	Donald Trump	OK. And I kept saying to myself, gee, why do they have to keep talking about going in?
0476	Donald Trump	All right.
0477	Donald Trump	So now they go in, and it is tough, because they've given the enemy all this time to prepare.
0478	Donald Trump	I don't want to do a lot of talking on the military.
0479	Donald Trump	I want to talk after it's finished, not before it starts.
0480	SYSTEM	[Voiceover]
0481	Donald Trump	When we come back, the millions of Americans who want to know what the replacement will be for Obamacare.
0482	David Muir	I'm just asking about the people who are nervous and watching you for reassurance.
0483	Donald Trump	We  here's what I can assure you.
0484	SYSTEM	[Voiceover]
0485	Donald Trump	And later, the moment in the Oval Office, President Trump revealing the conversation with President Obama, as they got into the motorcade, sharing that ride to the Capitol.
0486	David Muir	What was that car ride like to the Capitol?
0487	SYSTEM	[Voiceover]
0488	David Muir	When we come back.
0489	SYSTEM	[Commercial Break]
0490	David Muir	Let me ask you, Mr. President, about another promise involving Obamacare, to repeal it.
0491	David Muir	And you told the Washington Post that your plan to replace Obamacare will include insurance for everybody.
0492	David Muir	That sounds an awful lot like universal coverage.
0493	Donald Trump	It's going to be  what my plan is, is that I want to take care of everybody.
0494	Donald Trump	I'm not going to leave the lower 20 percent that can't afford insurance.
0495	Donald Trump	Just so you understand, people talk about Obamacare, and I told the Republicans this.
0496	Donald Trump	The best thing we can do is nothing for two years, let it explode, and then we'll go in and we'll do a new plan and the Democrats will vote for it, believe me.
0497	Donald Trump	Because this year, you'll have 150 percent increases.
0498	Donald Trump	Last year, in Arizona, 116 percent increase.
0499	Donald Trump	Minnesota, sixty some odd percent increase.
0500	Donald Trump	And I told them  except for one problem.
0501	Donald Trump	I want to get it fixed.
0502	Donald Trump	The best thing I could do as the leader of this country, but as wanting to get something approved with support of the Democrats, if I didn't do anything for two years, they'd be begging me to do something.
0503	Donald Trump	But I don't want to do that.
0504	Donald Trump	So just so you  Obamacare is a disaster.
0505	Donald Trump	It's too expensive.
0506	Donald Trump	It's horrible health care.
0507	Donald Trump	It doesn't cover what you have to cover.
0508	Donald Trump	It's a disaster.
0509	Donald Trump	I said to the Republican folks, and they're terrific folks, Mitch and Paul Ryan.
0510	Donald Trump	I said, look, if you go fast  and I'm OK in doing it, because it's the right thing to do  we want to get good coverage at much less cost  I said, if you go fast, we then own Obamacare.
0511	Donald Trump	They're going to put it on us.
0512	Donald Trump	And Obamacare is a disaster waiting to explode.
0513	Donald Trump	If you sit back and let it explode, it's going to be much easier.
0514	Donald Trump	That's the thing to do.
0515	Donald Trump	But the right thing to do is to get something done now.
0516	Donald Trump	I want to make sure that nobody's dying on the streets when I'm president.
0517	David Muir	You've seen the estimate that 18 million Americans could lose their health insurance if Obamacare is repealed and there is no replacement.
0518	David Muir	Can you assure those Americans watching this right now that they will not lose their health insurance or end up with anything less?
0519	Donald Trump	So nobody ever deducts all the people that have already lost their health insurance that liked it.
0520	Donald Trump	You had millions of people that liked their health insurance and their healthcare and their doctor and where they went.
0521	Donald Trump	You had millions of people that now aren't insured anymore.
0522	David Muir	I'm just asking about the people who are nervous and watching you for reassurance.
0523	Donald Trump	No, no, we  here's what I can assure you.
0524	Donald Trump	We are going to have a better plan, much better health care, much better service treatment, a plan where you can have access to the doctor that you want and the plan that you want.
0525	Donald Trump	We're going to have a much better health care plan at much less money.
0526	Donald Trump	We're going to have an explosion.
0527	Donald Trump	And to do it right, sit back, let it explode, and let the Democrats come begging us to help them, because it's on them.
0528	Donald Trump	But I don't want to do that.
0529	Donald Trump	I want to give great health care at a much lower cost.
0530	David Muir	So no one who has this health insurance through Obamacare will lose it or end up with anything less?
0531	Donald Trump	Well, you know, when you say no one, I think no one.
0532	Donald Trump	Ideally, in the real world, you're talking about millions of people  will no one?
0533	Donald Trump	And then, you know, knowing ABC, you'll have this one person on television saying how they were hurt.
0534	Donald Trump	OK. We want no one.
0535	Donald Trump	We want the answer to be no one.
0536	Donald Trump	But I will say Millions of people will be happy.
0537	Donald Trump	Right now, you have millions and millions and millions of people that are unhappy.
0538	SYSTEM	[Voiceover]
0539	Donald Trump	And as we walked through the White House, we asked the president about the voices, just outside in Washington, D.C., and across the country, the more than a million women, men and children who marched the day after the inauguration.
0540	David Muir	Let me just ask you while we're standing outside.
0541	David Muir	Could you hear the voices from the women's march here in Washington?
0542	David Muir	We know there were more than a million people who turned out.
0543	David Muir	And you are their president now, too.
0544	Donald Trump	It's true.
0545	David Muir	Could you hear them from the White House?
0546	Donald Trump	No, I couldn't hear them.
0547	Donald Trump	But the crowds were large, but you're going to have a large crowd on Friday, too, which is mostly prolife people.
0548	Donald Trump	You're going to have a lot of people coming on Friday.
0549	Donald Trump	And I will say this  and I didn't realize this, but I was told  you will have a very large crowd of people.
0550	Donald Trump	I don't know, as large or larger.
0551	Donald Trump	Some people say it's going to be larger, prolife people, and they say the press doesn't cover them.
0552	David Muir	I don't want to compare crowd sizes again.
0553	Donald Trump	No, you shouldn't.
0554	Donald Trump	But let me just say, what they do say is that the press doesn't cover them.
0555	David Muir	We saw the marches around the country.
0556	David Muir	And you are their president now.
0557	David Muir	Do you sense the responsibility to reach out now and to unite them?
0558	David Muir	And for those women, men, children who marched who are watching this, what would you say to them?
0559	Donald Trump	Well, I do, but I have to also say We just had an election a few weeks ago.
0560	Donald Trump	And they voted, in many cases, and some cases, they didn't vote, I imagine.
0561	Donald Trump	And we did have an election.
0562	Donald Trump	With that being said, absolutely I have responsibility to everybody, including people that didn't vote for  Trump.
0563	Donald Trump	Totally.
0564	Donald Trump	This is the Oval Office.
0565	SYSTEM	[Voiceover]
0566	Donald Trump	When we come back, President Trump takes us into the Oval Office.
0567	David Muir	What moves you the most about this room?
0568	SYSTEM	[Voiceover]
0569	David Muir	The president on what he's changed already here.
0570	David Muir	And the letter left by President Obama and the phone call after reading it, when we come back.
0571	SYSTEM	[Commercial Break]
0572	David Muir	So we're in the Oval Office.
0573	Donald Trump	This is the Oval Office.
0574	Donald Trump	This is truly one of the great spaces.
0575	Donald Trump	And I bring people in from General Motors and from Ford and the biggest people, and I bring in the labor leaders, and the people that are in the labor movement.
0576	Donald Trump	And they walk into this room, and they just want to take it in.
0577	Donald Trump	They could stand here for an hour just taking it in.
0578	David Muir	What moves you the most about this room?
0579	Donald Trump	Just the history of it.
0580	Donald Trump	The importance of it.
0581	Donald Trump	What's happened here.
0582	Donald Trump	I actually put some pictures up that I thought would be great.
0583	Donald Trump	Some of the paintings that I thought would be really appropriate, George Washington, Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Jackson, who a lot of people, they compare the campaign of Trump with, the campaign of  you have to go back to 1828, but that seems to be a comparison for, you know, certain obvious reasons.
0584	Donald Trump	But we put some of these up.
0585	David Muir	And we're standing on  we're standing on Ronald Reagan's rug?
0586	Donald Trump	This was Ronald Reagan's.
0587	Donald Trump	And you have a choice, you know, when you come in.
0588	Donald Trump	They have eight or nine carpets.
0589	Donald Trump	They have different furniture.
0590	Donald Trump	The desk is...
0591	David Muir	The resolute desk.
0592	Donald Trump	Yes.
0593	Donald Trump	Yes.
0594	Donald Trump	It's the resolute desk.
0595	Donald Trump	This is actually very nice.
0596	Donald Trump	This is actually a couple of things that are interesting.
0597	Donald Trump	This was given to me by one of the combatants that I fought to get here, and Adams versus Jefferson, and this book, they say this was the most vicious campaign ever fought for president until this.
0598	David Muir	Who gave this to you?
0599	Donald Trump	Somebody.
0600	Donald Trump	A combatant.
0601	Donald Trump	And this was the letter given to me by President Obama.
0602	David Muir	We saw that image of him the final morning that he was here putting the letter on the desk.
0603	Donald Trump	Which was  I won't show it to you or read it to you.
0604	Donald Trump	But a  just a beautiful letter.
0605	David Muir	Is there a line you can share that struck you most?
0606	Donald Trump	There were numerous lines.
0607	Donald Trump	So wellwritten.
0608	Donald Trump	So thoughtful.
0609	Donald Trump	So thoughtful.
0610	Donald Trump	And in the drawer, you know, put in the drawer, which is a custom, but I doubt too many of them were written in this manner.
0611	Donald Trump	He really  in fact, I called him and thanked him for the thought that was put into that letter.
0612	David Muir	I have to say, I have looked at a lot of those presidential letters that they have left for the next president.
0613	David Muir	That one looks a lot longer than the ones that I have seen.
0614	Donald Trump	It was long, it was complex, it was thoughtful, and it took time to do it, and I appreciated it.
0615	Donald Trump	And I called him and thanked him.
0616	David Muir	Was there something he said in that letter that surprised you?
0617	Donald Trump	Well, I think nothing that surprised me, but it was stated beautifully.
0618	Donald Trump	But  and I'm representing a lot of people, and I'm carrying on a very important tradition, and just do a great job.
0619	Donald Trump	He wants me to do a great job.
0620	Donald Trump	He said something that was very interesting to me.
0621	Donald Trump	He said, you know, if I thought your health care plan was going to be better than his plan, Obamacare, I would support it, and I believe he would.
0622	Donald Trump	I believe he would.
0623	David Muir	What was that car ride like to the Capitol, when you got into the car with the president who was about to leave, and you were about to...
0624	Donald Trump	The amazing thing to me  and he may say differently  is that we I think have sort of a great relationship, and yet it was a vicious campaign, and vicious things were said by him and by me about each other.
0625	Donald Trump	I mean, he said that, you know, I would never represent the Republican Party.
0626	Donald Trump	Then, I won, that I will never win.
0627	Donald Trump	And I said vicious things about him.
0628	Donald Trump	It was a very  you know, you talk about Jefferson and Adams.
0629	Donald Trump	This was rough.
0630	Donald Trump	And Hillary had a great asset on her side, him and Michelle, who is a phenomenal person.
0631	Donald Trump	But Hillary had these two people that were really campaigning, big league.
0632	Donald Trump	In fact, I was going out and campaigning  you know, really complaining about it.
0633	Donald Trump	I was saying, not really fair.
0634	Donald Trump	But to have that kind of vitriol, to have that kind of stuff going on, and then we're riding in a car together up Pennsylvania Avenue, and I'm saying to myself  I actually said to him, This is a little weird
0635	Donald Trump	But we really  we didn't discuss the negative.
0636	Donald Trump	We only discussed the future and the positive.
0637	Donald Trump	And we really got along well.
0638	Donald Trump	Now, again, he may say differently, but I don't think he would.
0639	Donald Trump	We really got along well.
0640	David Muir	Mr. President, you bring up Hillary Clinton.
0641	David Muir	You had her stand up at Statuary Hall and said some very kind things about her.
0642	Donald Trump	She fought hard.
0643	Donald Trump	She fought hard.
0644	David Muir	Do you think America is done hearing about investigations into Hillary Clinton?
0645	Donald Trump	I just don't know.
0646	Donald Trump	I mean, I hope so.
0647	Donald Trump	From my standpoint, we want to move onto the future.
0648	Donald Trump	So I hope so.
0649	Donald Trump	I don't know what the status of that is.
0650	Donald Trump	I know it's a lot of very serious stuff, but I certainly hope so.
0651	David Muir	We have seen the amount of action at this desk already this week.
0652	Donald Trump	Right.
0653	David Muir	The Dow hit 20,000 today.
0654	Donald Trump	Right.
0655	Donald Trump	I'm very proud of that.
0656	Donald Trump	Very proud of that.
0657	Donald Trump	The business community and the labor community, you saw that with the labor leaders that came out.
0658	Donald Trump	One of them said it was the single greatest meeting I've ever had with anybody, it's the highlight of my life.
0659	Donald Trump	And the Dow on top of it just hit 20,000.
0660	Donald Trump	First time in history.
0661	Donald Trump	I'm very proud of that.
0662	Donald Trump	Now, we have to go up, up, up.
0663	Donald Trump	We don't want it to stay there.
0664	David Muir	That's the challenge, Mr. President.
0665	Donald Trump	That's going to be the challenge, but it's gone up a lot since I won.
0666	Donald Trump	Don't forget, when I won, people thought, oh, maybe it will go down.
0667	Donald Trump	But the business world doesn't think that.
0668	Donald Trump	The business world knows me.
0669	Donald Trump	They don't think that.
0670	Donald Trump	And it was a steady climb.
0671	Donald Trump	And now we just hit a record and a number that's never been hit before.
0672	Donald Trump	So I was very honored by that.
0673	SYSTEM	[Voiceover]
0674	Donald Trump	The president then takes us through the West Wing to show us the photos they already have on the walls.
0675	Donald Trump	Now, these are some of the pictures that were taken.
0676	Donald Trump	This is the swearing in and the first dance with Melania.
0677	Donald Trump	Here's a picture of the event.
0678	Donald Trump	Here's a picture of the crowd.
0679	Donald Trump	Now, the audience was the biggest ever.
0680	Donald Trump	But this crowd was massive.
0681	Donald Trump	Look how far back it goes.
0682	Donald Trump	This crowd was massive.
0683	Donald Trump	And I would actually take that camera and take your time, if you want to know the truth.
0684	David Muir	I do want to ask you, Mr. President, about this photo right here.
0685	David Muir	I saw this moment on Inauguration Day.
0686	David Muir	I saw you put your hand on President Obama's back there, as he boarded Executive One, no longer Marine One.
0687	David Muir	What did you say to him?
0688	David Muir	I saw you smiling.
0689	Donald Trump	There is a warmth  look, if you see that picture, there is a warmth there.
0690	Donald Trump	But that was an incredibly beautiful moment.
0691	Donald Trump	And I've seen it over the years.
0692	Donald Trump	I've seen the good and the bad.
0693	Donald Trump	But the scene of that great machine turning on and lifting off, it was really something special.

0695	Donald Trump	He points to an image of his daughter, Ivanka, and his soninlaw, Jared Kushner, now a senior adviser to the president.
0696	David Muir	Is there any chance Ivanka might have an office right here in the White House?
0697	Donald Trump	Well, right now, she is just getting settled, moved to Washington.
0698	Donald Trump	Her husband, Jared, very, very smart.
0699	Donald Trump	Good guy.
0700	David Muir	We know he'll have a role.
0701	David Muir	He has an office.
0702	Donald Trump	Right, he does.
0703	Donald Trump	And he has an office.
0704	Donald Trump	We'll have to see what happens.
0705	Donald Trump	She is a special person.
0706	David Muir	You're not ruling it out?
0707	Donald Trump	She's smart and she's got every quality you could possibly have.
0708	Donald Trump	I don't rule out anything.
0709	Donald Trump	No, there's certainly a possibility.
0710	Donald Trump	And Jared has been here, and he's doing a great job.
0711	SYSTEM	[Voiceover]
0712	Donald Trump	And just before we leave, the president tells us he wants to show us just one more image.
0713	Donald Trump	One thing this shows is how far over they go here.
0714	Donald Trump	Look.
0715	Donald Trump	Look how far this is.
0716	Donald Trump	This goes all the way down here.
0717	Donald Trump	All the way down.
0718	Donald Trump	Nobody sees that.
0719	Donald Trump	You don't see that in the pictures.
0720	Donald Trump	But when you look at this tremendous sea of love  I call it a sea of love.
0721	Donald Trump	It's really something special, that all these people traveled here from all parts of the country, maybe the world, but all parts of the country.
0722	Donald Trump	Hard for them to get here.
0723	Donald Trump	Many of these people were the forgotten men and women, many of them.
0724	Donald Trump	And they loved what I had to say.
0725	Donald Trump	More importantly, they're going to love the result.
0726	David Muir	Mr. President.
0727	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.
0728	Donald Trump	Thank you, David.
0729	David Muir	Thank you.
