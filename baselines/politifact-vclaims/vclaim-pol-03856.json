Gov. Bruce Rauner and business groups say the state\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation system is unfairly biased against employers and has led, in the most recent national report, to Illinois having the eighth highest workers\u2019 compensation insurance rates in the nation.\nTwo dominant themes have emerged in the workers\u2019 compensation debate. One is that Indiana has been a magnet for Illinois business relocations because it has very low workers\u2019 compensation insurance rates.\nThe other is that Illinois has high rates because of the state\u2019s \"no-fault\" workers\u2019 compensation system. Any injury \"arising out of and in the course of employment\" is compensable with workers\u2019 compensation benefits, including medical care and paid time off for recovery. In legal terms, Illinois has no-fault standard of \"causation.\" Thus, a pre-existing condition that is aggravated in the course of work is covered under workers\u2019 compensation.\nGiven all this, a statement made during an Illinois House committee hearing on a workers\u2019 compensation reform bill might have struck an odd chord.\n\"The causation standard in Indiana is exactly the same as it is in Illinois,\" said David Menchetti, a labor attorney with the Chicago firm Cullen Haskins Nicholson Menchetti. Menchetti testified at the hearing in opposition to the bill, which would change Illinois\u2019 causation standard to the one described in Rauner\u2019s reform agenda.\nIf Indiana is attracting businesses away from Illinois because of its low workers\u2019 compensation insurance premiums, and if Illinois\u2019 no-fault causation standard is the cause of its high insurance rates, could Indiana really have the same legal standard as Illinois? We decided to check.\nTurnaround\nRauner\u2019s Turnaround Agenda contains a section devoted solely to enhancing the state\u2019s causation standard, and he has spoken extensively about the need to switch to a standard in which workers\u2019 compensation benefits aren\u2019t granted unless the workplace is \"more than 50 percent responsible for the injury compared to all other causes.\"\nHe\u2019s also been vocal about Illinois losing jobs and businesses to Indiana because of, among other things, Illinois\u2019 high workers\u2019 compensation insurance premiums.\n\"We should be kickin\u2019 tails, and look what\u2019s happening to us,\" Rauner said in a speech in August at the Illinois State Fair. \"Our jobs are going to Indiana. Come on. They\u2019re going to Indiana. They ain\u2019t going there for the weather.\"\nRauner is not the first to invoke the state\u2019s causation standard as problematic for businesses.\nIn a 2012 brief, Attorney General Lisa Madigan wrote, \"To protect taxpayer dollars, the legislature must address and change the causation standard that is currently applied by the IWCC and the courts.\" The attorney general\u2019s office, however, has never advocated for a specific standard and has not issued an official opinion on Rauner\u2019s proposal.\n\"From our perspective, there ought to be reasonable ways to change the standard that would not damage the purpose of workers\u2019 compensation to ensure that employees who are injured on the job can fully recover,\" Madigan\u2019s chief of staff, Anne Spillane, told Politifact Illinois in September.\nThe codes\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBruce Rauner\n\n\nstated on June 1, 2016 in a press conference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have lower family incomes in Illinois today than we had 17 years ago in Illinois ...\u00a0because of the control of (House) Speaker (Michael) Madigan and his Democrats.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Matt Dietrich \u2022 July 13, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Illinois Workers\u2019 Compensation Act invokes the term \"arising from and in the course of\" employment seven times in defining injuries subject to workers\u2019 compensation. Likewise, the Indiana Workers\u2019 Compensation code (ICC 22-3-6-1-[e]) defines \"injury by accident arising out of and in the course of the employment\" as compensable under the state\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation system.\nBy contrast, Florida -- whose causation standard Rauner wants to replicate in Illinois -- adds a conditional clause in its code: \"If an injury arising out of and in the course of employment combines with a preexisting disease or condition to cause or prolong disability or need for treatment, the employer must pay compensation or benefits required by this chapter only to the extent that the injury arising out of and in the course of employment is and remains more than 50 percent responsible for the injury as compared to all other causes combined and thereafter remains the major contributing cause of the disability or need for treatment. Major contributing cause must be demonstrated by medical evidence only.\" (440.09 [b])\nBut if Indiana and Illinois have identical causation standards in their workers\u2019 compensation statutes, why are Indiana\u2019s insurance premiums so much cheaper than those paid by businesses in Illinois?\nMenchetti cites two primary reasons. One is that Indiana pays significantly lower workers\u2019 compensation benefits. The other, he says, is that employers in Indiana, not injured employees, have first choice in medical treatment.\nA national compilation of workers\u2019 compensation laws by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Research Institute confirms that the initial choice of treating physician in Indiana lies with the employer, while in Illinois the choice is the employee. A 2015 report by nonprofit, investigative journalism website ProPublica shows that, on benefits for permanent partial disability, Illinois consistently paid more than the national average while Indiana generally was close to average. (Compensation for loss of an arm in Illinois, for example, is $439,858. The national average is $169,878, and Indiana pays $202,050.)\nMore than just causation\nWhile the statutes in Indiana and Illinois may use the same definition for causation, how the law is interpreted and applied makes the difference on cost, says Michael Lucci, who has studied workers\u2019 compensation and written extensively about it for the libertarian Illinois Policy Institute, which favors Rauner\u2019s reform agenda.\n\"I think the difference you\u2019ll find is largely subject to judicial interpretation and arbitration rulings,\" Lucci says. \"Causation is a difficult issue. We haven\u2019t engaged particularly hard on this issue.\"\nIn a recent analysis, Lucci offered a seven-point plan for reducing Illinois\u2019 workers\u2019 compensation insurance premiums. Changing the causation standard was not among them. The difference between eighth-most-expensive Illinois and second-least-expensive Indiana for workers\u2019 compensation insurance, Lucci says, can\u2019t be bridged by changing the causation wording alone.\n\"Their arbitrators have a narrower view of what constitutes a workplace injury,\" Lucci says.\nOur ruling\nAttorney David Menchetti testified before the Illinois House Labor and Commerce Committee that, \"The causation standard in Indiana is exactly the same as it is in Illinois.\"\nState workers\u2019 compensation statutes in both states confirm that Indiana and Illinois both are \"no-fault\" states in which an injury need only happen in the workplace to be covered by workers\u2019 compensation. Both define qualifying injuries as those as those arising from employment with no other conditions.\nAs noted in statements from Menchetti and Lucci -- who are on opposite sides of the larger workers\u2019 compensation reform issue -- the causation standard\u2019s effect on workers\u2019 compensation insurance rates is open to debate. The standard itself in Illinois and Indiana statutes is not.\nWe rate this statement True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03856"}
