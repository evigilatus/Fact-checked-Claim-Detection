You can\u2019t have incentives to be healthier. That makes no sense.\"\nDoes Obamacare (officially the Affordable Care Act), really prohibit incentives that would charge less to healthier people?\n\"Like Bill Clinton would say, it depends on what \u2018you\u2019 means,\" said Soeren Mattke, managing director of Health Advisory Services for the nonpartisan Rand Corp. think tank.\nA tale of two interpretations\nIndeed, insurance companies under the Affordable Care Act cannot require different rates based on a person\u2019s health and lifestyle. The HealthCare.gov website even expressly states companies \"can\u2019t take your current health or medical history into account\" when setting premiums.\nThe one caveat lies in the definition of health history.\nThe ACA allows five factors to be considered in setting premiums: location, age, plan category, whether dependents are covered and tobacco use. Tobacco use could fall into the health \"behavior\" category Ryan referenced, though smoking wasn\u2019t among the unhealthy vices he laid out for the hypothetical neighbor.\nBut Ryan\u2019s claim doesn\u2019t specify insurance companies. And if the \"you\" is interpreted as referring also to employers \u2014 that\u2019s how many of the experts we consulted read it \u2014 the claim gets dicier. \u00a0\n\"The Affordable Care Act allows employers to vary premiums by up to 30 percent to be able to reward employees not only for participating in wellness programs but to achieve specific metrics of health,\" said Meena Seshamani, director of the Office of Health Reform at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\nThe law even increased the maximum reward for involvement in a wellness program from 20 percent to 30 percent of the premium, also boosting the max to 50 percent for those in a smoking cessation program.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin LeMahieu\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a TV interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It takes quite a while on Election Day to load those ballots, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome 49 percent of Americans are insured through their employer, according to the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation. But not all employers have such programs, and then only a portion tie in financial incentives.\nKaiser\u2019s 2014 employer survey found 74 percent of firms offering health insurance have some kind of wellness program. Among those with programs, 36 percent of large firms and 18 percent of small firms offer financial incentives for participation.\nRyan\u2019s office didn\u2019t respond to our inquiries seeking clarity on who he was referencing or evidence to support his statement.\nWellness programs in dispute\nDespite the Affordable Care Act language, wellness programs remain a gray area of health care law \u2014 and a moving target.\nThe U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has sued some companies over wellness programs they believed went too far with incentives or disincentives. Wellness programs are typically a combination of screening activities (questionnaires and/or clinical tests) and interventions to specifically address risks such as weight, smoking, fitness and drug use.\nOne such case stemmed from the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin, where the EEOC alleged Flambeau, Inc., a plastics manufacturer based in Baraboo, violated the Americans with Disabilities Act by requiring employees to participate in a wellness program in order to get company health insurance. Judge Barbara Crabb dismissed the case in December 2015, however, agreeing with the company that the program fell under an exception allowing for activities related to administering an insurance plan.\nThe EEOC is appealing the ruling, even as it issued a new rule in mid-May attempting to clarify how wellness programs can comply with the ACA, the disabilities act and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).\nThis and similar EEOC lawsuits elsewhere are making employers hesitant to implement wellness plans that require certain benchmarks, said Tom Miller, resident fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute think tank.\n\"It\u2019s one thing to participate and be rewarded for it, it\u2019s another set of hurdles if you start requiring people to succeed at achieving certain goals,\" Miller said. \"It doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t do it, but there\u2019s a lot of smoke in the air that discourages employers from going that far as a general rule.\"\nOur rating\nRyan said, \"Under (Obamacare), you can\u2019t reward a person for better behavior. You can\u2019t have incentives to be healthier.\"\nRyan is largely on point if the \"you\" refers only to insurance companies, but there\u2019s nothing in the context to justify such a narrow interpretation. The claim was broad and implied a ban on incentives. That\u2019s not the case.\nWellness programs, while not available to everyone, are specifically authorized by the Affordable Care Act as a means for employers to raise or lower premiums by up to 30 percent based on employees\u2019 health-related behavior.\nFor a statement that is partly accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, our rating is Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04861"}
