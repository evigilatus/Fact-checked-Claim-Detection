A shared picture on Facebook repeats the claims of March 2019 that Harris \"has submitted an invoice to prevent a police officer from withdrawing his weapon without the permission of their supervisor.\" The post also states that \"the police officer cannot respond to the shooting without first notifying his supervisor and obtaining permission.\" The article brought together dozens of angry shares and comments about Harris being \"Moron\" to make such a suggestion. A user named Bill \"Paul--\" and we have to agree. There is no such bill. This article was referred to as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The \"second chance\" bill is the ironic source of the original information that has been traced by several fact-checkers to a sarcastic website called the Blue News Network. Facebook articles were published on January 11, 2021 in the Facebook newspaper Nancy Belusi, who was no longer the Speaker of the House of Representatives by Samantha Buterman: January 12, 2021, written by \"Mickey Cobb.\" His r\u00e9sum\u00e9 says that the pieces he writes for the blue news network are \"cheerful and funny when people don't know it.\" Another gift is the web page about us, which assures readers that its content \"is more nonsense...\" Just to make sure Harris didn't really offer a \"second chance\" of legislation (as the website said), we checked the official Congress website. Of all the 184 bills presented by Harris in 2019, no such bill was submitted in 2019. The story continues to revive the story, originally published by the Blue News Network, According to our friends in Factcheck.org, the story was published on numerous blogs and other media, including the Ben Ferguson Show, a conservative radio talk show in the United States. Although this story has been dismantled by several organizations verifying the facts, it continues to be disseminated to the social media, as well as to other forums and sites. Without a sarcastic acquittal, people think it's real. Our claim that Harris tried to make officers ask permission to release their weapons lost all his malignant marks while travelling through social media. The prosecution is ridiculous, so we evaluate it with pants on fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00744"}
