The red bars indicate the tenure of Republican presidents George W. Bush and Trump, while the blue bars indicate the tenure of President Barack Obama, a Democrat.\n\nTrump\u2019s first problem is a straightforward factual inaccuracy. He said that \"right now,\" growth was 3.2 percent. However, the most recent growth number, for the first quarter of 2018, wasn\u2019t 3.2 percent. It was considerably lower, at 2.0 percent. (The next growth number, for the second quarter of 2018, won\u2019t be available for several more weeks.)\nOn Trump\u2019s watch, the U.S. did see one quarter of 3.2 percent growth -- the third quarter of 2017. By now, that data point is three quarters old.\nArguably, the bigger problem with Trump\u2019s assertion is the idea that \"nobody thought that was possible.\" Here, Trump is confusing 3 percent growth during a single quarter with 3 percent growth sustained over an entire year.\nDue to normal variations in the economy, meeting the 3 percent threshold for a quarter is not uncommon. But it has been almost a decade and a half since the U.S. economy grew at a 3 percent pace over an entire year.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the chart shows, the last time the economy as a whole grew at 3 percent for an entire year was in 2005, when it grew at 3.3 percent.\n\"Economists do not expect a consistent 3 percent annual growth from the U.S. economy given our demographics and our current productivity numbers,\" said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist. (Read our more detailed explanation of economists\u2019 reasoning.)\nBy contrast, quarterly increases of 3 percent are not rare -- in fact, they happened eight times under Obama, including levels Trump has not yet reached, such as 4.6 percent (twice) and 5.2 percent (once).\nThe one caveat to keep in mind is that Trump\u2019s task in expanding GDP rapidly is harder than it was for Obama, said Gary Burtless, a Brookings Institution economist. That\u2019s because the recovery has been going for so long -- since June 2009 -- that the economy has less \"slack\" in it that could feed quick growth.\n\"Experience shows that it is easier to see quarters with relatively rapid real GDP growth when the economy can grow both because of a growing working-age population and rising productivity and because many of the involuntarily unemployed are finding jobs,\" Burtless said.\nOur ruling\nTrump said, \"Watch those GDP numbers. We started off at a very low number, and right now we hit a 3.2 (percent). Nobody thought that was possible.\"\nThis is inaccurate two ways. First, the most recent saw GDP growth of 2.0 percent, not 3.2 percent. And second, exceeding 3 percent GDP growth in a quarter is not an unusual achievement -- Obama accomplished it eight times. The real achievement would be a full year at 3 percent, which hasn\u2019t happened under Trump yet.\nWe rate the statement False.\n Share the Facts 2018-07-02 16:48:49 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  \"Watch those GDP numbers.
