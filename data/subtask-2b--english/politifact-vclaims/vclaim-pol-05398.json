Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential bid is no exception.\nIn a Feb. 12 Medium post, Clinton wrote, \"As president, I will work to raise the federal minimum wage back to the highest level it\u2019s ever been\u200a \u2014 \u200a$12 an hour in today\u2019s dollars \u200a\u2014\u200a and support state and local efforts to go even further.\"\nHere we\u2019re checking if Clinton\u2019s proposal to raise the minimum wage to $12 an hour would bring the minimum wage \"back to the highest level it\u2019s ever been.\"\nWe began by looking at the history of the inflation-adjusted minimum wage and found that the highest-ever inflation-adjusted value was $10.69 an hour in February 1968. The second-highest was $9.69 an hour in February 1967. You can see the data here and in the following graph.\n\nSo Clinton\u2019s $12 minimum wage actually would go beyond restoring, or bringing back, the minimum wage to its highest level ever. It would be $1.31 an hour higher in purchasing power than the previous record -- or 12 percent higher.\nWhat\u2019s going on?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we asked the Clinton campaign for an explanation, they pointed to a paper by the Economic Policy Institute, a left-of-center think tank. This paper looked at how the minimum wage compared to the median wage at the time.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the paper, in 1968, the minimum wage was about half as high as the median wage at the time -- 52.1 percent. By 2014, that had fallen to 37.1 percent, meaning that wages overall had risen while the minimum wage failed to keep up.\nLooking ahead to a proposed $12 minimum wage, the paper estimated that raising the minimum wage that high would bring the ratio back up to between 49.9 percent and 54.1 percent, or roughly what it was in 1968. And it found similar results when using a different benchmark -- the average hourly earnings of nonsupervisory production workers.\nEconomists we checked with thought this was a credible standard for Clinton to use, and using this statistic supports her overall point. Indeed, Clinton would have been correct if she\u2019d said she would work to raise the federal minimum wage back to where it was in comparison to the median wage at its historical record.\nBut outside the economics department lounge, that\u2019s a much bigger mouthful than saying she\u2019d bring the minimum wage \"back to the highest level it\u2019s ever been\u200a\u2014\u200a$12 an hour in today\u2019s dollars.\"\nThe problem for Clinton\u2019s streamlined phrasing is that it oversimplifies in a way that could give readers a misleading impression. The term \"today\u2019s dollars\" usually means \"inflation-adjusted,\" and using the inflation-adjusted minimum wage, she\u2019s wrong that a $12 minimum wage has historical precedent.\nOur ruling\nClinton said she will \"work to raise the federal minimum wage back to the highest level it\u2019s ever been\u200a\u2014\u200a$12 an hour in today\u2019s dollars.\"\nThe minimum wage has never previously been \"$12 an hour in today\u2019s dollars\" -- it\u2019s gone as high as $10.69 an hour. However, Clinton has a point using other economic data. The data suggests that a $12 minimum wage would be similar to the 1968 wage when compared to median wages at the time.\nClinton\u2019s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05398"}
