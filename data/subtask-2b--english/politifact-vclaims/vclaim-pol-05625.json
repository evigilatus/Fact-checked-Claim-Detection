This is lower than any other state, it says.\nThe news release qualifies certain limitations of the data, referring to the data as a \"snapshot\" and saying that the number does not reflect who is eligible for HUDs homeless assistance grants programs.\nIt says the \"point-in-time count only captures those persons sleeping in sheltered and unsheltered locations on the night of the count.\"\nSo the count reflects all homeless veterans in unsheltered locations that night?\n\"It\u2019s not an exact science,\" acknowledges HUD spokeswoman Rhonda Siciliano. \"Obviously, going out and counting people on the street you\u2019re not going to be 100 percent accurate.\"\nSiciliano told PolitiFact that HUD\u2019s counting method would probably generate two different numbers if it was done on two nights instead of one.\n\"It\u2019s a very fluid situation,\" she said. \"People go in and out of homelessness.\"\nErik Wallin, executive director of Operation Stand Down Rhode Island, is among critics who say the methodology of the assessment significantly minimizes the actual number in this case.\nWallin argues that many homeless veterans are unlikely to acknowledge their background when approached in a shelter or on the street. Some veterans known to the Veterans Administration are not known to HUD, he said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChain email\n\n\nstated on December 20, 2010 in a message via the Internet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnemployment and the housing and auto industry crises can be fixed by giving a million dollars to every worker over age 50 to retire.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy C. Eugene Emery Jr. \u2022 December 22, 2010\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWallin\u2019s organization served 57 veterans who were homeless when they approached Operation Stand Down for help in January of 2015. Wallin says that homeless veterans who aren\u2019t in shelters aren\u2019t likely to hang out where other homeless people congregate.\nWallin talks about one veteran who chose to live in his van as Operation Stand Down worked with him to find housing.\nEric L. Hirsch, a Providence College sociology professor who coordinated the count, said he believes the assessment, which was conducted in the wintertime, did not miss a lot of homeless people who were living outside.\n\"If someone feels we did, they needed to document that,\" he said. \"If they had documented it and there was evidence of it, then they would have been included in the count.\"\nThe nature of homelessness -- a condition that many people cycle in and cycle out of -- can make it very hard to quantify the homeless over the course of a full year, especially in warmer climates where homeless people live outside year round.\nBut for the same reason, the point in time approach might give the impression that fewer numbers of people are affected by homelessness.\n\"The point in time count is really a snapshot and shouldn\u2019t be interpreted as a prevalence measure,\" says Dr. Thomas O\u2019Toole, a physician who cares for Rhode Island veterans and also directs the Veteran Administration\u2019s National Center for Homelessness Among Veterans.\nHUD\u2019s definition of homelessness also affects the count.\nSome critics, including Wallin and Hirsch, also say the definition doesn\u2019t include individuals who are forced to live with a friend or with a relative because they don\u2019t have resources for their own home.\nHirsch said he estimates there could be hundreds of homeless veterans living under such circumstances but HUD doesn\u2019t count this segment of the homeless population due to concerns about who is voluntarily living with someone else and who is forced to do so.\nHirsch provided one other piece of info to consider when evaluating HUD\u2019s claim of 107 homeless veterans in Rhode Island on a night in January 2015.\nRhode Island\u2019s Point In Time count was conducted on Feb. 25, 2015. That\u2019s not a night in January.\nOur ruling\nSome vocal critics, who are knowledgeable about the extent of homelessness in Rhode Island\u2019s veteran population, question the usefulness and accuracy of HUD\u2019s point in time count.\nThey weren\u2019t able to provide hard evidence, for example an alternative count based on logs or records, of more than 107 homeless veterans in Rhode Island in January of 2015.\nBut while HUD\u2019s press release describes how the point-in-time count works, calling it a \"snapshot,\" it could say more about the possibility that the count missed homeless veterans who might not have been in shelters.\nThe claim is partially accurate but it leaves out important details. For that reason, the ruling is Half True.\nIf you have a claim you\u2019d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, email us at [email\u00a0protected]videncejournal.com.
