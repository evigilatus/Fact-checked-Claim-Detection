During the discussion of the proposal, Betancourt stressed the urgency of the resolution, noting that the Senate must respond quickly to what he described as a worsening situation on the border. \"194,000 foreign criminals detained in Texas prisons from 2011 to 2019 were charged with more than 299,000 criminal offences,\" text of the decision. The Bentcourt figures come from State data on people here illegally and are accurate. However, the experts say that the numbers are out of context and do not provide an accurate picture of any possible relationship between immigration status and criminal activity. The data of the Texas Police Service refer to the charges and convictions of Christy Ingram, a staff member of the Bentcourt Court, that the data contained in the decision came from the Texas Public Safety Department, which illegally follows the crime statistics of persons in the country. The latest data on the Agency &apos; s website shows that between 1 June 2011 and 31 March 2019, there were 194,000 people classified as \"illegal aliens\" detained in local prisons in Texas. In total, these 194,000 persons were charged with \"more than 303,000 criminal offences\" resulting in \"more than 123,000 convictions\" for murder, assault, burglary and other charges. Ingram Bettencour and his associates said \"to stand behind the data\" and used figures from the entire eight-year period because this is the time available from the state. She had not responded to the request for comment, wondering why the decision considered charges in criminal cases rather than convictions. The figures in the Bentcourt decision are the same as those published by the State, but experts said that the implication of the decision that people here commit a disproportionate number of crimes or increase the crime rate is misleading. Graham Osei, Professor of Sociology at William and Mary College, who studies criminology, said that the illegal count of all criminal charges against people here does not accurately describe the society as a whole. One of the main shortcomings of the State data was that the figures reflected only the criminal offences recorded for individuals already in prison. \"If you go to any prison system and choose 194,000 people over eight years and add all those crimes, you are likely to get very large numbers,\" said Osi. \"You choose yourself over the inhabitants of criminals in their conduct.\" Note that previous criminology research found that a small percentage of the population was responsible for \"a disproportionate share of the crimes committed.\" \"A report like this, or a study that selects a sample that is (detained), they interfere with that upper crime, a smaller sub-group,\" he said. \"So, of course, the crimes that will appear will be greater.\" But these figures try to combine two things that are not necessarily linked - criminal activity and immigration status. \"It's like saying, \"Hello, there are all these crimes committed by people who have been arrested, then tied or tied to foreign criminals,\" added Osi. \"It is clear that cherry is chosen in a way that tries to create a relationship between immigrant status and behaviour.\" According to the SDP website, the information it publishes does not \"try to claim that foreign nationals in the country commit more crimes than other groups illegally.\" On January 27, 2021, Marco Rubio says in his remarks: \"Only in the Third World you do not see this routine use of the trials of former leaders.\" It is true that \"if the perpetrator and the victim are not in the same place at the same time, the crime does not occur,\" but removing that one criminal (or a population) will not end the crime. \"The only way to get rid of crime together is to get rid of all people,\" he said. Alex Nowaraste, an immigration policy analyst at the Liberal Cato Institute, agreed and said that the state's argument was \"insensitive statistical terms.\" \"What matters is not the total number of crimes, but the crime rate,\" he said. \"This tells you how you are threatened by criminals.\" :: Crime rate versus total. Noracet conducted research on the rates of illegal arrest and conviction of persons here and locally born Americans using data from 2015, the most up-to-date and complete information available at the time of his study. It was found that immigrants are less likely to be imprisoned than persons born in the United States and that \"illegal immigrants have lower prison rates throughout the country and in the state of Texas for Americans born at home.\" He also found that in Texas, \"illegal immigrants have a 50 per cent lower criminal conviction rate than Americans born in the country.\" Noraste researched these rates within each sub-group, which means he looked at things like the rate of death convictions among unauthorized immigrants. Michael Light, Professor of Sociology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said that the totals of charges or convictions, such as the number presented in the Bentcourt decision, were not well considered, but did not provide much insight into public safety or behaviour. \"imagining that I was claiming that women are less violent than men, which is closer to our social reality in criminology,\" he said in an e-mail. One had to say that this was not true because in 2015 more than 78,000 women were arrested for violent crimes, and about 1,000 were arrested for murder according to FBI records. These statistics are in no way inconsistent with the original statement that men tend to be more violent.\" If data showed that the rate of violent crime among men was higher than that of women, the elimination of women meant that the rate of violent crime for the entire population would be the rate of violent crime among men. \"In other words, our chance to be victims of violence would be much higher if the population were removed from women, even though they committed tens of thousands of crimes,\" he said. \"The same logic holds for the deportation of immigrants.\" Lyatt &apos; s research has shown that crime rates in immigrant communities are low, compared to Americans born in the country of origin, and that areas with high numbers of migrants tend to have lower overall crime rates than those with fewer numbers of migrants. He said: \"These statements are not inconsistent with the number of crimes committed by immigrants.\" \"194,000 foreign criminals detained in Texas prisons from 2011-2019 were charged with more than 299,000 criminal offences.\" These figures come from data published by the Department of Statistics. His numbers are true, but she doesn't tell the whole story. We're mostly assessing this claim right. In fact, this statement is accurate but requires further clarification or information.
