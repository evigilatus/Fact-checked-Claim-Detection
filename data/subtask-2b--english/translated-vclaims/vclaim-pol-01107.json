The air travel of Belauce recently referred to the headlines, but not for the reason Woolery referred to. The Speaker of the House of Representatives was planning to travel to Belgium and Afghanistan on military aircraft, when President Donald Trump cancelled her flight and asked her to stay in Washington to negotiate an end to the government closure. Wallerie deployed a tweet on the same day Trump refused to use Pelosi's military aircraft. \"Nancy Belucci's liquor bill for her trips from Washington to San Fran every week?\" We're paying for it, \"Woolery Gridd Jean 17. \"100 bucks. On average 52,000 bucks, a year for Boze. Taxier's money.\" We found no evidence to support this claim Moreover, the Belucci office said that Congresswoman did not drink. There was no evidence that Woolery &apos; s claim seemed to be surprisingly similar to an earlier statement we had verified in 2010, when Michelle Bachman, the presidential candidate, once accused Belusi of spending $100,000 on liquor flights - which we valued as pants on fire. The original source of Bachmann &apos; s claim was a large collection of documents obtained by the Judicial Supervision Authority through the Freedom of Information Act, a conservative group prosecuting public corruption and other matters. A Woolery spokesman sent us the same set of documents when we asked for evidence. However, in no case do they support the assertions of the speakers. On January 13, 2021, in a press statement summarizing the findings, the Judicial Monitoring Board wrote that \"the travel of the military spokesman cost the United States Air Force $2,100,744.59 over a two-year period - $101,429.14 to cover the expenses of aviation, including food and alcohol.\" (This covers both domestic and international travel). In the case of Bachmann, I mentioned a figure of alcohol expenditure that was close to a much larger number - $101,429 - for all non-aircraft costs for the trip. It is unclear how Walleri reached his annual figure of $25,000. Neither is it true. In 2010, the Belucci office told us - and reaffirmed this check - that it \"don't drink alcohol.\" One assistant added that she was no longer carrying out weekly flights through military aircraft, a practice that had been common since then and had been phased out. She's now traveling an ad between Washington and California. Our judge, Wollery, said, \"Nancy Belucci's liquor bill for her trips from Washington to San Fran every week?\" We're paying for it. A thousand dollars. On average 52,000 bucks, a year for Boze. Taxier's money.\" We were unable to find any evidence to support Woolery &apos; s claim, which was remarkably similar to the slander about the Pilosi tape of the year 2010, in which we evaluated the pants on fire. In addition, her office says she doesn't drink alcohol. We value these pants on fire. Update: This report was completed shortly after publication to include a response from the Woolery spokesman.
