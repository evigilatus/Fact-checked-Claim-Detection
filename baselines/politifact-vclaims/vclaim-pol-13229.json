John Kasich says new state labor law doesn't cut worker pay, pension or health care", "text": "Opponents and supporters of Ohio\u2019s new collective bargaining law are preparing for a possible referendum in November that would decide whether the controversial measure stays on the books.\n\nSo it\u2019s no surprise Republican Gov. John Kasich, a proponent of Senate Bill 5, immediately began defending the law after he signed it on the last day of March.\n\nThe law will sharply reduce public workers\u2019 collective bargaining rights.\n\nUnions have declared the law an attack on Ohio\u2019s middle class. Kasich rejects the argument that it will damage public workers\u2019 livelihoods.\n\n\"In this bill that I\u2019ve just signed, we don\u2019t cut anybody\u2019s salary. We don\u2019t take away their pension. And we don\u2019t destroy their health care,\" Kasich said March 31 in a interview with Sean Hannity on the Fox News Network.\n\nCampaigns for and against SB 5 are expected to spend tens of millions of dollars to sway voters should opponents of the new law collect enough signatures to put the referendum on the ballot. Kasich himself sent an e-mail to supporters promoting passage of SB 5 and seeking campaign donations.\n\nWith such a passionate debate on the horizon, PolitiFact Ohio decided to check out Kasich\u2019s characterization of SB 5.\n\nBefore we get into the specifics of Kasich\u2019s claim, it is important to remember a few things:\n\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSB 5 does not alter any existing contracts.\n\n\n\nThe law will not take effect until after the fall election if enough signatures are gathered by a June 30 deadline to put the referendum on the ballot.\n\n\n\nIf that deadline passes and signatures are short of the required 231,147, the law takes effect in July.\n\n\n\n\nNow let\u2019s begin.\n\nWe\u2019ll break this down into thirds, examining how SB 5 affects pensions, health care and worker salaries. We relied on interviews and an analysis of the 444-page bill by the nonpartisan Ohio Legislative Service Commission to reach our conclusions.\n\n Impact on pensions\n\nKasich was correct when he said the bill does not take away worker pensions. The new law could affect amount employees contribute toward their pension plans. It does not change pension benefits in any way, nor does it grant management new authority to do so.\n\nMany public workers contribute 10 percent of their salary toward their pension while the employer contributes 14 percent of the a worker\u2019s salary. Some unions, however, have negotiated deals where the employer pays a portion of the employee contribution. If an employer agreed to pay 2 percent of the worker share, for example, it would pay 16 percent of the worker\u2019s salary and the worker would pay 8 percent.\n\nSenate Bill 5 prohibits the practice, known as a \"pension pick-up.\" So Kasich is correct to say the bill does not \"take away\" any worker\u2019s pension. Some workers who benefited from pension pick-ups, however, would have to pay more of their pension contributions under SB 5.\n\nImpact on health care\n\nKasich says the bill does not \"destroy\" workers\u2019 health care. The governor is correct here too because the bill does not change health care benefits. It limits the share of the premiums that the public employer can pay toward those benefits.\n\nThe new law bars public employers from paying more than 85 percent of health care coverage costs. That leaves at least 15 percent to employees. State workers currently pay 15 percent of their health care costs, but many other public workers pay less. While SB 5 will shift health care costs onto some workers, it does not \"destroy\" benefits.\n\nImpact on wages\n\nThe shifts in pension and health care contributions could have a direct effect on wages. If the new law shifts a bigger share of retirement and health care costs onto workers, they\u2019ll want higher wages to make up the difference so their take home pay remains intact.\n\nKasich said \"we don\u2019t cut anybody\u2019s salary.\"\n\nIn a literal sense, he is correct. SB 5 does not set new salaries for public workers. But the new law effectively wipes out salary schedules in past labor contracts and directs cities and unions to agree to new salary structures that assign pay raises based on job performance.\n\nKasich other supporters often tout the leverage the new law provides local governments to control labor costs. Management gains a new edge under SB 5 through the reduction of public workers\u2019 collective bargaining rights, a ban on striking and a new system to resolve labor disputes that favors employers.\n\nSo while Kasich has said the bill does not cut workers\u2019 pay, he also has promoted SB 5 as a tool to control labor costs.\n\nWhich is it? Critics say the answer is obvious.\n\n\"Something has to give somewhere,\" said Dennis Willard, a spokesman for We Are Ohio, an anti-SB 5 group collecting signatures to put the bill on the fall ballot. \"The only possible way for these local governments to save money is to eliminate jobs or reduce wages. There\u2019s no other way.\"\n\nKasich spokesman Rob Nichols insisted the bill \"doesn\u2019t prescribe wages,\" so it is inaccurate to conclude SB 5 cuts workers pay. But reduced pay is a near certainty in some communities.\n\nKasich says the bill \"didn\u2019t cut anybody\u2019s wages,\" but some key points are missing from that statement:\n\u00a0\n\n\nWorkers who have to pick up an increased portion of their health care and pension premiums will see less take-home pay in their checks unless their public employer raises wages to cover the heightened premiums -- a doubtful proposition if the new law is truely a tool to control labor costs.\n\n\n\nCities across the state are looking to cut costs \u2013 and SB 5 gives mayors and school boards the leverage to cut pay as they negotiate with their workers in the future.\n\n\nThose are important pieces of information needed to put Kasich\u2019s statement in proper context.
