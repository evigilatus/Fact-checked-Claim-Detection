He can\u2019t be president.\"\nConstitutional provision\nThat comment would have been of a piece with inaccurate \"birther\" charges about the Democratic president, who was born in Honolulu, Hawaii in August 1961 to an American mother and Kenyan father.\nAt issue is the constitutional provision requiring any president to be a \"natural born citizen\" of the United States--meaning the person must be a citizen at birth, most legal experts concur. The candidate also must be 35 years of age and a U.S. resident for 14 years.\nWhat does it mean to be a \"natural born citizen\"? Most legal experts contend it means someone is a citizen from birth and doesn\u2019t have to go through a naturalization process to become one. And if that\u2019s the definition, then Cruz is a natural born citizen by being born to an American mother and having her citizenship at birth. (See a full rundown of Cruz\u2019s eligibility in this updated PolitiFact story.)\nCruz flip-flop?\nThe Facebook post, making the case for Cruz\u2019s flip-flop, says Cruz said March 23, 2015, the day he announced his presidential candidacy: \"All you need to know about my parentage is my mother was a citizen. My father and place of birth are irrelevant.\"\nHypocrite!\nNo confirmation of either comment\nExcept, ahem, an extensive search of the Nexis news database and online news sources yields no sign of Cruz, a Houston lawyer elected to the Senate in 2012, making either statement. Our searches led us only to a March 26, 2015, web post on Debunkr.net saying the same; Cruz hasn\u2019t made these comments.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe asked Cruz\u2019s campaign if Cruz had ever said Obama couldn\u2019t be president for anything connected to his birthplace. He \"has not,\" Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier emailed.\nIn news stories dating from 2013 to the present, Dallas Morning News reporter Todd J. Gillman, who heads that paper\u2019s Washington, D.C., bureau, has detailed Cruz\u2019s citizenship actions including a decision to legally end his dual U.S.-Canada citizenship in June 2014. At the time, Cruz made his birth certificate available to reporters:\n\nSOURCE: Email, Catherine Frazier, then-press secretary, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, to Jonathan Tilove, chief political writer, Austin American-Statesman, Aug. 19, 2013\nPreviously, Gillman took note of a Mother Jones magazine article stating Cruz\u2019s father, Dallas-area pastor Rafael Cruz, had made a comment while stumping for his son that suggested Obama be sent back to Kenya.\nIn September 2012, the elder Cruz spoke of sending Obama \"back to Kenya.\" That's the land of birth for Obama's father, the News noted in a Nov. 1, 2013, news story, though the 44th president was born in Hawaii, \"making him a natural-born American two ways -- by birth on American soil and because his mother was from Kansas.\"\n\"We have our work cut out for us,\" the elder Cruz told a North Texas Tea Party gathering Sept. 12, 2012, as later revealed by Mother Jones. \"We need to send Barack Obama back to Chicago. I'd like to send him back to Kenya, back to Indonesia.\"\nAt the time, Frazier said the pastor did not speak for his son. Ted Cruz subsequently said his father made an \"ill-advised joke,\" the News reported.\nOur ruling\nA Facebook meme indicates Ted Cruz has conveniently flip-flopped on whether the president must be U.S.-born.\nWe found no evidence Cruz made the presented comments or that he\u2019s changed his position about the \"natural born citizen\" provision. While he\u2019s spoken occasionally about his own birth and citizenship, he appears not to have made declarations about Obama\u2019s origins.\nThis makes the Facebook post factually unsupported and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!\n\nPANTS ON FIRE \u2013 The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9fb7e53e-44be-41dc-a91b-15f4bed19831", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06578"}
