Warner cited two \"our truth\" as evidence. \"Ed Gillespie... attacks Mark Warner with false ads calling misguided, completely artificial,\" says the novelist from the ad. While these words are spoken, the words \"Simbly False\" and \"Mileding\" appear on the screen with citations from the PoliticsFact this year - the first of September 28 and the second of April 25. Let's take a look at what we've already said about the glespie that Warner claims he owes. The first case concerns a miscalculation given to Gillespie &apos; s recent announcement that our colleagues at Polly Fact National gave Warner the \"Lee of the Year\" award in 2013 to promise four years ago that he would not vote for health-care reform that took away people &apos; s love insurance schemes. We used the words \"simply false\" in the governor's summary. She never mentioned the story of Poletti Fruitte, who declared her lie to Year Warner. She focused on President Barack Obama's repeated promises that under the Affordable Care Act, \"If you want insurance, you can keep it.\" Obama made this promise at least 37 times over the years and maintained it long after it had enacted regulations to ensure that some people would lose those plans because of the minimum coverage requirements of the Anti-Corruption Act. The second citations by Warner relate to the verification of the facts we made on a statement by the Virginia Republican Party that Warner voted with President \"97 percent of the time.\" But far from rebutting the claim -- which became essential in Gilsby's speeches and announcements -- we were evaluating it correctly. Check the facts (Kirk Cox) was mentioned on January 13, 2021 in a speech. Virginia ranked lowest third of the states in the management of the COVID-19 vaccine. \u2022 On 20 January 2021, we referred to a few issues with statistics, collected by CQ Weekly, a non-partisan news service in Washington that was once known as Congressional Quarterly. First of all, Obama took a position only 28% of the bills Warner voted on, and more than half of them were to confirm the President's appointment. The Democrats of the Senate generally supported the President with 95.4 per cent of the time during the Warner term. Warner significantly supported the President when I voted for Obamaker in 2010. The President repelled the vote against the regulation of offensive weapons and against the delay in starting automatic budget cuts in 2013. Warner says that the assessment of presidential support ignores his efforts to work across the corridor with the Republicans, especially in an attempt to develop the two-party debt reduction plan. He has correctly observed that many of the congressmen classified him among the most conservative Democrats in the Senate. Did we call the statistics misleading? No. But a political scientist we quoted did so. Stephen Farnsworth of the University of Mary Washington said, \"We imagine that Warner voting like a member of Parliament to the President would be misleading.\" Our announcement of Warner's TV says that Poletti Fuckett Virginia rejected two negative claims that were broadcast in Gillespie's ads. Warner's right, which we described as \"simply false,\" is a reference in one of Gilsby's ads to Warner's \"comrade of the Year\" being obtained by our colleagues in PoliticFact National. But the senator is wrong to suggest that we call it \"rogue\" another attack by his opponent -- that Warner voted with the president 97 percent of the time. In fact, we evaluated the right statistics. In the article, we quoted a political scientist who said it would be \"a mistake\" to conclude from statistics that Warner is a man who agrees with the President. Warner tries to walk on a fine line on the ad by having the moderator say \"experts call\" the ads are misleading. But the bold letters on the screen that say \"PORTIFACT VERGIANIA\" put the words in Manna. In one case, this is true; in one case, it is not.
