The fight against the Ebola virus is custom-made for such speculations and conservative radio host Glenn Beck raised them in full during the Oct. 15 broadcast of his radio show.\nBeck envisioned fearful Americans avoiding trips to the mall, leading to a downward spiral in consumer spending. Although to date, the virus has only been known to be transmitted by contact with the bodily fluids of one infected person, Beck said that would change.\n\"Think of this America, please think of this,\" Beck said. \"Every time somebody new gets the Ebola virus, it mutates. It's going to go aerosol.\"\nTo go \"aerosol\" would mean water droplets from a sneeze or a cough could transmit the disease. There is no recorded case of this occurring with Ebola; one study positively asserts that the virus does not spread this way.\nStill, Beck argued that the 8,000 victims of Ebola in West Africa represent 8,000 \"different combinations\" of Ebola.\nAround PunditFact, we say there\u2019s no way to check a prediction, but what we can do is dig deeper into Beck\u2019s claim that the Ebola virus mutates with each new person it infects.\nWe contacted Beck\u2019s producers and they added some nuance that Beck left out.\n\"Many of those mutations mean nothing, but some of them might be able to change the way the virus behaves inside the human body,\" the producers said in an email.\nAccording to two top\u00a0infectious disease researchers, Beck is correct that the virus mutates, but left out what his producers later noted -- namely that not\u00a0every mutation does anything to make Ebola more deadly or more difficult to treat.\nThe explanation why can get technical, but you can break down what happens as a series of steps that reduce the impact of these genetic changes. By the way, both researchers also said that the virus doesn\u2019t need a new victim to mutate. It mutates inside its host, even if it is never passed on.\nMost mutations hurt the virus\nYou need to understand a basic fact about Ebola. As of now, there is no \"cure,\" as in there are no drugs that kill Ebola. Doctors treat the symptoms of Ebola while the body fights the virus. In that respect, it\u2019s like the flu.\nAdam Lauring is an assistant professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases and Department of Microbiology and Immunology at the University of Michigan Medical School. Lauring explained that because Ebola is an RNA virus, each time it replicates in a person\u2019s body, there\u2019s a good chance that small changes will take place. But Lauring emphasized that most changes do not strengthen the virus or make it more resistant to human defenses. In fact, the typical mutation has the opposite effect.\n\"The available data consistently show that most newly generated mutations in RNA viruses reduce fitness,\" Lauring said. \"That is, most mutations are made and then lost from the population. They do not take hold.\"\nPut simply, the virus might mutate but it doesn\u2019t really matter.\nLauring said we should keep in mind that the Ebola virus largely works through the proteins it produces. The virus\u2019 genes make the proteins and then the proteins help the virus infect more parts of the body. Lauring\u2019s point is that with most mutations, the genes produce a protein that doesn\u2019t do what the virus needs and that copy of the virus dies.\nMost mutations don\u2019t change anything\nWith the virus replicating itself billions of times in a single victim, some genetic drift will take hold. But in this group, there are two basic types: synonymous and non-synonymous. The difference is in how they affect proteins.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Synonymous mutations don\u2019t change the protein sequence,\" Lauring said.\nRemember, the proteins determine how the virus works. If the proteins remain the same, so does the virus, for all practical purposes. (This is cellular biology so things are more complicated.)\nSince non-synonymous mutations change proteins, we\u2019d want to know how often they happen in Ebola. Fortunately, a large team of researchers published a paper that goes directly to that point.\nStephen Gire, a researcher at the Sabeti Lab at Harvard University, was one of the authors. Gire and his colleagues recently took samples from 78 patients in Sierra Leone over a three-week period. When they drilled down into the virus\u2019 genome, they found 40 mutations that had taken place in \"protein coding regions.\"\nAbout a third were non-synonymous. Put another way, 14 were able to change the proteins in the virus. The other 26 left the virus functionally as it had been before.\nOf that group of 14, eight occurred in regions that Gire called functionally interesting. But Gire emphasized, \"that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that these mutations changed or helped the virus.\"\nWithout more research, Gire said it\u2019s impossible to know if these mutations actually made the virus more successful as an organism, and more able to move from one person to the next.\nMutations might not be passed on\nGire and his colleagues found that even those mutations that propagated in a victim\u2019s bloodstream might go nowhere.\n\"We have many instances where we see a mutation pop up, but then there are no transmissions from that patient and so that mutation potentially dies off,\" Gire said.\nThis gets back to the central topic in Beck\u2019s statement. It isn\u2019t a question of whether the virus mutates, but whether it adapts to new environments and spreads out in a new form.\n\"Mutation is not evolution,\" said Lauring.\nA solemn reminder\nThis isn\u2019t to say Ebola is not a serious threat. Gire and his co-authors wrote that \"continued progression of this epidemic could afford an opportunity for viral adaptation, underscoring the need for rapid containment.\"\nAt the very end of the article, there is this dedication:\n\"Tragically, five co-authors, who contributed greatly to public health and research efforts in Sierra Leone, contracted EVD (Ebola) and lost their battle with the disease before this manuscript could be published: Mohamed Fullah, Mbalu Fonnie, Alex Moigboi, Alice Kovoma, and S. Humarr Khan. We wish to honor their memory.\"\nOur ruling\nBeck warned that every time someone new gets the Ebola virus, it mutates. First, mutation and replication go hand in hand and infecting a new person doesn\u2019t change that. But the much larger point is that Beck is painting mutations with a broad brush.\nMost of them hurt the virus and are automatic dead-ends. Of those that don\u2019t actually hurt it, about two-thirds don\u2019t change how Ebola functions. Of those that change how the virus functions, there\u2019s no data to say whether the functional changes matter. However, the most recent study in West Africa found that many new varieties are not passed on to new victims.\nBeck\u2019s statement about Ebola mutations is partially accurate but leaves out important details.
