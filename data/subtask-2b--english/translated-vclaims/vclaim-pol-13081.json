Bush.", "text": "On May 16, 2011, an interview with Bloomberg TV, the minority leader of the house Nancy Belusi D-Calif. She commended President Barack Obama &apos; s career record while shooting former President George W. Bush. \"We went into this situation where we had tax cuts for the richest people in our country, which didn't create jobs,\" she said. \"In the first year of Obama's administration, more jobs were created in the private sector than in the eight years of the Bush administration, with all the tax cuts that President Bush was.\" According to the Bureau of Labour Statistics, the economy left approximately 4.2 million jobs in the private sector during the first year of the Obama administration - January 2009 to January 2010. In the meantime, in eight years under Bush, the economy has acquired a net of 188,000 jobs in the private sector. Thus, while the growth of jobs in the Bush era was poor by historical standards, it was still better than 4.2 million jobs lost in the Obama era. That means Belusi was wrong. Nadim al-Shami, spokesman for Belusi, Politi Fakt, told him that Belusi had simply missed a point of dialogue that I had used many times before. In one of the differences provided by her Office, Pelosi sent out a news release, in part, which said, \"Americans received 12 consecutive months of private sector employment gains totalling 1.5 million jobs. These are more jobs in the private sector than were added in the eight years of the Bush administration.\" But when we verified an expression similar to this talking point, we only gave it half right -- technically correct, but misleading because of cherry picking. Pelosi was right that the economy created 847,000 jobs during the period to which she referred. But it would have been wrong if it had mentioned total employment rather than private sector employment. She chose the dates of her start and end in a way that was very Obama-friendly and not Bush-friendly. Pelosi began counting from a low point of employment and only the number of the upward portion of the trend line, while Bush was denied the same method. This time, speaking with Bloomberg TV, Belusi didn't even get the technically correct statistics. So we assess it wrong. On January 13, 2021, the distinguished fact-finding bloggers announced in a story in which General David H. Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for the use of marines for inaugural security, saying, \"We are not working for you.\"", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13081"}
