The manager of Fox Trump Neil Cavoto asked about his proposal to prevent Syrian refugees and others from entering the United States. Trump shook events around the world, including in Indonesia and France, and said that migration could be \"a great Trojan horse.\" \"When I looked at immigration, when I looked at the line... where are the women?\" Trump said. There are only a few women. Very few children. Strong men. Strong men. -Yeah. -Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. People look at this and say, \" What's going on?'\" Trump made a similar allegation in October. It was fake at the time, and it's fake now. We asked about Trump's campaign to get more information about his claim, but we didn't hear a response. However, there are two databases that track the movements of migrants in Europe and Syrian refugees. He does not align himself with his statement. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees registers and tracks Syrian refugees in camps in several States, including Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and North African countries. According to figures as at 31 December 2015, the total is over 4.6 million. Of these 4.6 million, 50.7 per cent are female and 51.8 per cent are children (boys and girls) aged 17 or under. So the majority of refugees are 1. Women; distinguished bloggers for fact-finding were mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Trump Act of Insurgencies - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 January 11, 2012 17 years or younger. In total, only 22.7 per cent of United Nations refugees throughout the Middle East and North Africa are men over the age of 18. Looking at the migration crisis on a wider scale helps little in the case of Trump. The United Nations is also tracking so-called \"marine access,\" refugees and migrants crossing the Mediterranean Sea into continental Europe. The number of people who have crossed into Europe since the beginning of 2015 is just over 1 million, with approximately 3,800 dying during the journey. The United Nations divides these migrants into three categories: adult men, 49 per cent; adult women, 19 per cent; and children, 31 per cent. Our Governor Trump said that among Syrian refugees and immigrants coming to Europe, \"there are very few women. Very few children.\" The data do not in any way support that claim. More than 4.6 million Syrian refugees entering Europe are women and children aged 17 or under. Among migrants arriving by sea - about 1 million people - 31 per cent of children and 19 per cent of women. We're assessing this statement wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05552"}
