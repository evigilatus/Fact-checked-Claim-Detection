Rick Scott to tout the unemployment rate as a sign of success. Buckhorn later told us he used the unemployment rate as a yardstick because \"it shows we are emerging out of this recession. I think it\u2019s progress.\"\n\nWe wanted to know if unemployment is declining faster in Tampa than anywhere else in the nation.\n\nBuckhorn\u2019s evidence was a short article in the Tampa Bay Times that said that \"Tampa Bay tied for the second-largest drop in unemployment over the past year among major metro areas.\"\n\nWe turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the government agency that tracks employment data, for more details. We first looked at the latest data Buckhorn had available to him when he spoke on Tuesday.\n\nThe agency, it turns out, doesn\u2019t measure unemployment in \"Tampa\" as Buckhorn described but rather the metro area of Tampa, St. Petersburg and Clearwater. The unemployment rate in the Tampa metro area dropped 2.2 percentage points from June 2011 through June 2012, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That tied for thesecond-largest decline among 49 metro areas with a population of at least 1 million people.\n\n(New data released Wednesday changed the 12-month decline in unemployment from 11.3 percent to 9.4 percent for the year ending in July. At a difference of 1.9 percentage points, it is the highest of all major metro areas.)\n\nEven though construction jobs continued to languish, the area posted notable over-the-year gains in leisure and hospitality, and professional and business services, according to the Tampa Hillsborough Economic Development Corp.\n\nSo the statistic is largely accurate, though Buckhorn shorthanded the Tampa/St. Petersburg metro area as Tampa and used a figure that only compares major metropolitan areas.\n\nThere\u2019s another thing to note.\n\nThe unemployment rate in the Tampa area remains higher than the national and state averages. Also, the unemployment rate does not account for Florida\u2019s contracted labor force, which is smaller now because people have given up on finding work. The Florida Legislature\u2019s economic research agency found that nearly 70 percent of the drop in Florida\u2019s unemployment rate can be attributed to a shrinking workforce, not new jobs. The unemployment rate would be much higher had the workforce held steady, stated the August 2012 report.\n\n\"I would say nationally and statewide we want the unemployment rate to come down, but not because the labor force is shrinking,\" said Sean Snaith, a University of Central Florida economist.\n\nEconomists say an increased unemployment rate actually could be a better economic indicator because it may signal that discouraged workers are coming back to the labor force.\n\nStill, Snaith said, \"there's some real growth in (the Tampa area), granted we know it's not been everything that it should be or could be.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nBuckhorn said that the unemployment rate is declining faster in Tampa \"than almost anywhere else.\"\n\nWe have a few quibbles with that. Buckhorn could have more clear that he was referring to a part of the Tampa Bay area and that the statistic only measures metropolitan areas.\n\nAlso, the real story behind a declining rate isn\u2019t always so cheery. It doesn\u2019t account for discouraged workers, which are the biggest drivers behind Florida\u2019s falling rate.\n\nOn the flip side, he gives himself some cover with use of the word \"almost,\" and the metro area has seen a significant dip in the unemployment rate.\n\nOn balance, we rate this claim Mostly True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolitiFact Florida is partnering with 10 News for the election.
