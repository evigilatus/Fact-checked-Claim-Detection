Terrorists have been apprehended at the U.S. southern border, and immigrant incarceration rates are significant, she said.\n\"You also look at the criminal justice system. One in four inmates are illegal immigrants,\" Boothe said July 26 on Fox News\u2019 The O\u2019Reilly Factor. She was reacting to an earlier interview about border security O\u2019Reilly had with Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., during the second night of the Democratic National Convention.\nWe wondered if 25 percent of inmates are people who are in the country illegally.\nBoothe told us her comment was based on a Heritage Foundation analysis\u00a0about\u00a0illegal immigration and border security. Citing a U.S. Government Accountability Office, the foundation noted that \"one of every four inmates in federal prisons is an illegal immigrant.\"\nThe Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, referred to a March 2011 GAO report on incarcerations, arrests and costs of criminal immigrants.\nThat report says that \"in fiscal year 2005, the criminal alien population in federal prisons was around 27 percent of the total inmate population, and from fiscal years 2006 through 2010 remained consistently around 25 percent.\"\nBut the report\u2019s definition of \"alien\" is broad and includes people here legally. It defines criminal aliens as \"noncitizens who are residing in the United States legally or illegally and are convicted of a crime.\"\nSo, about one in four inmates in federal prison is not a U.S. citizen, but not necessarily with an illegal immigration status.\nThe accurate number is likely less than one in four, but precise data on the immigration status of inmates is hard to come by. Related data is collected differently by federal agencies and not inclusive of all facilities.\nA U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman told us her agency does not have data on the number of inmates who are in the country illegally. The Federal Bureau of Prisons also told us it does not track data on immigration status of its inmates.\nBut it does have statistics on inmate citizenship. About 22 percent of the bureau\u2019s inmates are not U.S. citizens, based on information updated\u00a0June 25, 2016. Its count of noncitizen inmates includes people who may be deported.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs for state facilities, a Bureau of Justice Statistics report published in September 2015 said that by year-end 2014, there were about 1.56 million prisoners in both state and federal correctional facilities. About 69,000 of them \u2014 or 4 percent \u2014 were not U.S. citizens. But it didn\u2019t break down the noncitizen category by legal or illegal immigration status.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\nThat data excludes noncitizen inmates in local jails under jurisdiction of state or federal correctional authorities and noncitizens in privately contracted facilities. The private facilities house deportable immigrants serving federal sentences and once they finish their sentences, they are turned over to ICE.\nOverall, there doesn\u2019t appear to be an\u00a0absolute number of incarcerated undocumented immigrants.\n\"There is no definitive source that reports legal status of those arrested or incarcerated,\" said Anne Morrison Piehl, a professor of economics and criminal justice at Rutgers University, who has researched the relationship between immigration and crime.\nUnlike race, age and gender, the immigration status of an inmate isn\u2019t often asked, said Ramiro Martinez, a professor of sociology and criminology at Northeastern University.\nMost inmates are native-born\u00a0and most states have a small foreign-born population, so immigration status is not relevant to most of the prisoner population, Martinez said.\nAnd most immigrants in state and federal prisons are in for property or immigration offenses, Martinez added.\nStudies by Piehl and a colleague also have found that immigrants have much lower incarceration rates than\u00a0the native-born population. \"There is no reason to think that immigration in general presents a particular crime threat,\" they concluded.\nOur ruling\nRepublican strategist Lisa Boothe said on Fox News\u2019 The O\u2019Reilly Factor \"one in four inmates is an illegal immigrant.\"\nThe data Boothe cited included immigrants who were here legally and illegally. So it\u2019s likely that number is at least somewhat inflated.\nFederal agencies say they don\u2019t track data on inmates in the country illegally, and several immigration experts told us there\u2019s no definitive source for that specific number.\nWe rate Boothe\u2019s statement Mostly False.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2b111d18-9eae-40c2-9430-4a50717931e1", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04476"}
