{"url": "/factchecks/2016/jul/19/rudy-giuliani/rudy-giuliani-wrongly-says-hillary-clinton-open-bo/", "speaker": "Rudy Giuliani", "vclaim": "\"Hillary Clinton Open Boundaries\"", "truth_label": "false", "date": "stated on July 18, 2016 in a speech at the Republican convention\u201d:", "title": "Rudy Giuliani misstated Hillary Clinton for open borders.", "text": "The former Mayor of New York City, Rudy Giuliani, defended Donald Trump's plan to secure the border and said that Hillary Clinton would follow the opposite approach. \"You know Donald Trump will secure our borders,\" said Giuliani at the 18th Congress of July. His competition had a chance to do this and failed. Hillary Clinton's open border.\" The claim that Clinton will establish \"open borders\" suggests that it will allow undocumented migrants to travel freely or with very few restrictions between two countries. That's not what Clinton suggested. In 2013, Clinton supported legislation that included a path to citizenship (on conditions) and enhanced border security. However, some experts argue that \"open borders\" do not necessarily mean any enforcement at all, but rather make it much easier for undocumented migrants to stay here. Clinton wants to make it easier for many undocumented migrants, but this is not the same as getting rid of enforcement or letting people into and out of the United States without border controls. We couldn't locate Giuliani's spokesman on Monday night. The Clinton and Trump proposals took two very different approaches to migration, although they said they preferred safe borders. During this campaign, Clinton called for addressing immigration laws, including the path to citizenship within the first 100 days of her life. However, it also called for border protection and the deportation of criminals or those who pose a threat. \"We have to secure our borders. I agreed, voted in his favour, and I believe in him, and we need to deal with the families, the workers here, who made contributions, and their children,\" as she said in November. \"We can do more to secure our borders, and we have to do more to deal with 11 or 12 million people who are here, getting them out of the shadows.\" This is perfectly consistent with her view as a New York Senator and Secretary of State. On February 1, 2021, Tom Cotton mentioned in an interview with Fox and friends \"Many of these arriving immigrants, we have no way of checking their background for either health or security.\" By Miriam Valverdi, in her 2014 book, 3 February 2021, Clinton commended the 2013 Immigration Bill, co-sponsored by a group of two-party senators, including Marco Rubio of Florida. The bill included billions of dollars for border law enforcement over a decade in respect of new surveillance equipment and fencing along the Mexican border, as well as the addition of 20,000 border personnel. This bill was passed by the Senate, but it did not reach a vote in the House of Representatives. The Clinton Immigration Platform does not constitute an open border, Alex Nowaraste, immigration expert at the Liberal Cato Institute, who has already told Politi Fact Florida when we have verified the fact of a similar claim by Trump that we have mistakenly assessed it. The open borders existed before 1875, when there were no federal restrictions on migration to the country. The United States has immigration restrictions from 1875 to 1924 without a border patrol, established in 1924. It was wrong to confuse \"open borders\" with anything less than full enforcement of immigration laws. It is also wrong to \"call on Clinton to be open borders, while also supporting massive increases in border security in order to better enforce our restrictive immigration laws.\" However, Clinton said that it wanted to limit deportations to violent criminals, not to expel children, to end raids and visits, and to go beyond President Barack Obama for Darim and their parents if legally possible - although that was in a legal impasse after the United States Supreme Court had reached an impasse. This expands considerably that can avoid deportation in the White House of Clinton. These policies are less applied to supporters of low migration, including Mark Crecorian, Executive Director of the Centre for Migration Studies, and Roy Beck, Executive Director of the United States of America. Beck told Bolivi Vac that the term \"open borders\" was inaccurate. However, if undocumented migrants \"can survive unless a violent crime is committed, this is very close to opening the border. You don't have to grant pardon -- you can't have a threat of deportation, and it allows people to stay.\" The Governor, Julian, said, \"Hilary Clinton to the open border.\" Clinton supported the 2013 bill that would have invested billions of dollars in border security in addition to the path to citizenship. As a presidential candidate, she called for securing borders and targeting criminals and those who posed a security threat. While its plan will make it easier for many undocumented migrants to avoid deportation, this is not the same as allowing everyone &apos; s freedom at the border and ending enforcement. We value this allegation wrong. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/cbe27e82-8435-4872-8e49-12f87464cb98", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04675"}
