The compensation package for CEO Mike Morris rose 22 percent to $8.7 million in 2010.\"", "truth_label": "true", "date": "stated on March 31, 2011 in a Twitter post.:", "title": "Ward Armstrong says Appalachian Power wants a 10 percent rate hike", "text": "House Minority Leader Ward Armstrong has been fighting Appalachian Power Company for two years.\n\nApco won the last round in January, when Republicans in the House of Delegates squashed two Armstrong bills aimed at returning Virginia to its old system of electric utility regulation. Energy lobbyists and the company, alongside Dominion Virginia Power, argued that most of Apco\u2019s price increases in recent years would still have been permitted under the old system and that no change was needed.\n\nArmstrong\u2019s latest salvo came March 31, the same day Apco announced it was seeking a series of rate increases in Virginia. He took to Twitter to vent his frustration.\n\n\"Apco wants another 10% rate increase. The compensation package for CEO Mike Morris rose 22% to $8.7 million in 2010,\" Armstrong wrote.\n\nArmstrong has botched up the facts in past attacks on Apco, so we took a look at his latest claims.\n\nApco announced in a March 31 press release it was seeking to raise rates by \"about 10 percent\" for 2012 through a series of rate filings. The actual increase, if granted in full by the State Corporation Commission, which oversees utility regulation in Virginia, would be 9.6 percent. Under the new rate, Apco says, customers would pay $104.99 per 1,000 kilowatt-hours.\n\nThe company has discussed its proposed rate hikes with Armstrong and other politicians representing Apco customers. \u00a0Del. Anne Crockett-Stark, R-Wytheville, told The Roanoke Times that she and other lawmakers on both sides of the aisle will oppose the company\u2019s rate request when the SCC holds its hearings. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nUnder Virginia\u2019s utility regulations, companies can adjust the \"base rate\" they charge customers every two years. But they also can can also file separate \"rate adjustment cases,\" or \"RACs\" at any time. RACs are designed to cover certain changes in costs, such as a sudden increase in fuel prices -- primarily coal in Apco\u2019s case -- or changes in the cost of meeting environmental regulations.\n\nThe company requested and received a hefty rate increase for environmental costs about two years ago. In January hearings on Armstrong\u2019s bill, Apco executives said the money was needed to meet stricter air pollution mandates from the Environmental Protection Agency. The utility was adding new air \"scrubbers\" that reduced the amount of pollution, especially sulfur dioxide, released by its coal-fired plants.\n\nApco customers complained that between the biennial base rate increases and RAC changes, they never knew what they would be charged month to month. The company said it has decided to bundle the base rate case and three RACs together this year to avoid that problem, with the aim of altering rates once and then leaving them in place for an extended period of time.\n\nIn the current request, the firm wants to boost its base rate by about 6.3 percent, then tack on a 3.2 percent increase for environmental costs and a 0.5 percent increase to meet voluntary standards on renewable energy investments. After a slight decrease in generation rates, the requested increase comes to 9.6 percent.\n\nSo Armstrong\u2019s right about the size of Apco\u2019s requested increase, but what about the CEO\u2019s salary?\n\nFirst, we should note that Michael Morris is not the CEO of Apco, as Armstrong implies. Morris is the CEO of American Electric Power, Apco\u2019s parent company. AEP serves about 5.3 million customers in 11 states, including Virginia, West Virginia and Tennessee. The company operates through several different subsidiaries; Apco serves AEP\u2019s customers in Virginia and West Virginia.\n\nArmstrong took the salary information from an article by The Associated Press, which reported that Morris received total compensation of $8.7 million in 2010. The AP said that was a 22 percent increase from 2009.\n\nThe AP\u2019s salary calculations are based on a company\u2019s annual proxy filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The calculation includes any salary, bonuses and perks, as well as the estimated value of stock options given to the executive in a given year. The AP does not include the change in value of an executive\u2019s pension. That figure is usually included in an executive\u2019s reported salary.\n\nAccording to AEP\u2019s 2010 proxy, Morris was paid $9 million in 2010, up from $7.5 million in 2009. That\u2019s an increase of 20 percent. Morris made $10 million in 2008.\n\nAEP does not disclose the salary for Charles Patton, Apco\u2019s CEO.\n\nLet\u2019s review our findings.\n\nArmstrong\u2019s right that Apco has requested a roughly 10 percent rate increase. The actual request is for a 9.6 percent jump, but even the utility said \"about 10 percent\" in its press release. \u00a0\n\nReaders could easily conclude from his message that Mike Morris is Apco\u2019s CEO. That\u2019s not the case; Morris is actually CEO of American Electric Power, Apco\u2019s parent company. But Armstrong does cite Morris\u2019s 2010 salary, and the increase from 2009, accurately. The salary figures for Apco CEO Charles Patton are not available.\n\nWe rate this statement True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13228"}
