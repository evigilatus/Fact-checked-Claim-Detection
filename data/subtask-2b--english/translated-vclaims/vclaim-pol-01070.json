The live broadcast of the space shuttle crashes and lands in the air. Children throughout the United States witnessed the event from the classroom, where they sat in front of televisions, ready to celebrate the first \"Space Master\" in NASA, Christa McCullough. :: Scooby, Michael J. Smith, Ronald McInner, Alison Onizuka, Judith Resnick, Gregory Jarvis, and Makulev, New Hampshire teacher, who was selected to fly through NASA's \"Teacher in Space\" programme. President Ronald Reagan quickly addressed an amazing nation from the Oval Office, calling it \"a national loss.\" Unfortunately, conspiracy theorists are making a mockery of large-scale tragic events. The same seems to be the case with the Challenger disaster. One of the articles, on Facebook, participated in the thirty-third anniversary of the incident, claiming that the whole event was a bluff, and that the crew were alive and well today. The article says: \"They didn't die in 1986. I found Astro-Nut Judith Resnick by searching Yale a few moments ago.\" The images of the crew are accompanied by side comparisons with the so-called \"Dublegangers.\" This conspiracy - which claims that people like crew members with identical or similar names still live their lives around the United States - has been roaming the Internet since at least 2015, when it was dismantled by other fact-checkers. The Facebook site also links YouTube video from 2016 highlighting the two partners while playing the song \"Twilight Zone.\" The article was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This is an example of conspiracy theories that combine a few aspects of a proposal in an attempt to prove that a large and well-documented event has been forged. To say that the evidence is inconclusive would be an underestimation. Why not add to this rumour the only evidence is that at least six of the seven crew members (except Gregory Jarvis) have suspicions of identical or similar names about the approximate ages that crew members may have if they are alive today. There are some problems in this thinking. First, most of these couples had very different backgrounds and were in very different locations, professional roles, and institutions than the crew before the disaster. For example, Judith Resnick, who publishes Facebook in particular. \"I just found Astro-Nut Judith Resnick by searching Yale's website a few moments ago.\" But Judith Resnick at Yale University was studying law at school (and the University of Southern California) in the 1970s and 1980s at the same time as the astronaut Judith Resnick was studying and working in electrical engineering, eventually with NASA. On January 12, 2021, he wrote in an Instagram article saying that Joe Biden remained silent about the violence in Black Lives-Mite protests. \u2022 16 January 2021, in 1985, Professor of Law Resnick wrote papers for Law Review magazines. In 1984, astronaut Resnick was on a space flight, making her the second American woman to go into space. Women themselves cannot have worked in different jobs, at different geographic locations, at the same time. This can also be applied to Richard Skopje, Sharon (Krista), Makuliv and Michael Smith. Second, the two so-called villages of Onizuka and McNeir are respectively the brothers of the actual astronauts, Claude Onizuka and Karl McNear. These are both real people and not supposed identities. Karl McInner, interviewed his brother, including at the Legion of Stories, on the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Challenger explosion in 2011. Over the years, Claude Onizuka has paid tribute to his brother for hosting Onizuka Science Day for school children in indigenous Hawaii. Third, some similarities do not actually resemble crew members, with different structures and characteristics of the face, and they seem to have been chosen to simply try to help prove the conspiracy. Finally, for a major national conspiracy that NASA is supposed to have planned, it is highly unlikely that the crew will live openly, under the same names and without physical disguise in place. We also found four crew members - Skopje, Smith, Onizuka and McKinner - in the social security mortality index, which is not exhaustive, because the database covers most, not all, of the people who have died since 1935. \"The absence of a certain person in SSDI is not proof that this person is alive. In addition, there is a possibility that false death records have been entered into the DMF, \"Ancistry.com says a site. But these four matched the birth and death dates of the crew members, and the states where their social security cards were issued. Our social media announcement claims that the crew of the Challenger Space Shuttle in 1986 is alive and well, and the tragedy was a hoax organized by NASA. The suggestion that NASA organized deaths, for no particular reason, and then allowed the crew to live their lives in public without changing the name or physical disguise is highly unlikely. Also, for something very open, it was not observed until almost 30 years later. Furthermore, death certificates and \"like\" backgrounds directly conflict with the essence of conspiracy theory. This false rumor is a disgrace to the legacy of the crew and is based on assumptions that are loosely linked to each other. This is the pants on fire!\" Sharing the facts 2019-02-01 21:50:51 UTC Politics Fact 2 1 7 PoliticFact Dating: Facing that the 1986 Challenger Space Shuttle disaster was a bluff and that the crew did not die and is still alive today.
