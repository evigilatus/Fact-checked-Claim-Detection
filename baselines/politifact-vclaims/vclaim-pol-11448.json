We wondered if Johnson got his numbers right.\n\nSuper PACs became legal after a 2010 U.S. Supreme Court decision. They are an object of ire for those who think they can be used to buy elections and help donors obscure their identities. \u00a0\n\nA Johnson spokesman said the congressman got his data from articles in Politico and Roll Call. The stories, which ran Feb. 8, lay out the findings of \"Auctioning Democracy: The Rise of Super PACs & the 2012 Election.\"\n\nThe report was authored by left-leaning policy and advocacy group Demos and U.S. Public Interest Research Group, or U.S. PIRG, a consumer advocacy group. It argued that super PACs skew American politics by giving outsize influence to wealthy donors who hold views that do not represent those held by the broader public.\n\nJohnson\u2019s account matched both news accounts\u2019 descriptions of the \"Auctioning Democracy\" report. One of these descriptions could have been more precise, but they were not unreasonable.\n\nFrom the advent of super PACs to the end of 2011, donors have contributed a total of $181 million in what are called \"itemized individual contributions\" to super PACs, the report states. These are contributions from donors who give more than $200. Super PACs must report donor names once their contributions pass this threshold.\n\nThe report did not tally contributions by small donors, said Adam Lioz, a Demos official and an author of the report.\n\nDemos and U.S. PIRG found that 196 people donated $100,000 or more to super PACs, which is just shy of 200 individuals. Calling them \"super-rich\" is polarizing, but it\u2019s reasonable to assume that people who can afford to make a $100,000 donation have unusually high incomes.\n\nWe used the report\u2019s findings to calculate that donations of the \"super-rich\" amounted to about 43 percent of total contributions. This is some 7 percentage points lower than the \"roughly half\" figure that Johnson used.\n\nFor-profit businesses contributed 17 percent of itemized donations, the report states. This is just shy of the 20 percent Johnson cited.\n\nWe checked with the Sunlight Foundation, a nonpartisan organization that advocates for more transparency in government. It is the source of much of the data used in the report, so we wanted to get the organization\u2019s take on the numbers. A spokesman said they found no problems with the conclusions of \"Auctioning Democracy.\"\n\nBut for the sake of due diligence, we compared the report\u2019s numbers to data published by the Center for Responsive Politics, which keeps a rolling tally of super PAC contributions on its website OpenSecrets.org.\n\nThe data from the CRP and the \"Auctioning Democracy\" report are not easy to compare. They track contributions over different time periods, and the CRP tallies a broader pool of contributions.\n\nHowever, we felt an analysis of the CRP data would give us a rough sense of whether Demos and U.S. PIRG overstated their results to make their case.\n\nFirst, we looked at the CRP\u2019s count of total super PAC donations.\n\nFrom 2010 to late February, about $215 million had been donated to super PACs, according to the CRP data. This is about $35 million -- or 20 percent -- more than the data published in \"Auctioning Democracy,\" but this difference did not signal major flaws.\n\nThe CRP\u2019s number should be significantly higher than the figures in \"Auctioning Democracy.\" The report excludes donations of $200 or less as well as contributions for the 2012 calendar year. The CRP includes them.\n\nNext, we looked at whether \"roughly half\" of super PAC donations came from 200 \"super-rich\" people. The CRP publishes a list of the top 100 super PAC donors for the 2012 election cycle on its website. We found they donated about $74 million so far, or 57 percent of the cycle\u2019s $130 million total.\n\nThe count in \"Auctioning Democracy\" was lower, which suggests that Demos and U.S. PIRG did not overstate the significance of donations from the \"super-rich.\"\n\nWe had difficulty using the CRP\u2019s data to check corporate or business donations. The CRP\u2019s Web page lists too few organizations, and does not distinguish between for-profit businesses and groups such as labor unions or advocacy organizations.\n\nOur ruling\n\nJohnson wrote that \"[i]n the last two years, super PACs raised more than $180 million -- with roughly half of it coming from fewer than 200 super-rich people and roughly 20 percent from corporations.\"\n\nOn balance, Johnson\u2019s claim reflects the findings of a report by two advocacy groups that are critical of super PACs. The statistics Johnson uses also make sense in light of data published by a separate group.\n\nWe give Johnson a True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden canceled the Keystone pipeline because Warren Buffett \u201cdonated $58 million\u201d to his campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 29, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11448"}
