Nathan Deal, President of the Republic, says his efforts to cultivate jobs and the economy have been paid to schools. The educational track record also includes the adoption of an amendment to the 2012 Charter School and the conclusion of a bi-party agreement to support HOPE-funded scholarships and pre-education programmes. Jason Carter from Atlanta, his challenger, the democratic state, says the deal changed Georgia's kids. It is the most critical of the $1 billion annual austerity cuts in education recommended by the Agreement in the first three of the four state budgets. Carter, who voted in favour of these three budgets, promises that if elected, spending on education will increase through a three-pronged approach involving economic growth, reducing waste of government and seeking tax fraud. The last proposal culminated in the attention of our fact-checkers. We contacted Carter to obtain evidence to support the candidate's claim. His spokesman, Brian Thomas, referred to a January report by the United States Department of Audit and Accounts, which showed about $4.4 billion in outstanding State taxes. The authors of the report estimate that $1.9 billion out of $4.4 billion has not been collected. But Thomas said strong leadership would better raise that money. \"I put the power of the Governor's office behind it,\" Thomas said the Augusta Cronicle newspaper earlier this month. At a press conference on August 27, Carter told journalists: \"There is $2.5 billion not collected there from people who betray their taxes, and against whom we do not enforce the law.\" The Auditor &apos; s report indicates that approximately $815 million out of $2.5 billion is at least 15 years old - making it more difficult to collect. Of course, that leaves two thirds of the money there apparently to take, right? The Georgian Institute of Budgets and Policies left is not sure that the plan is applicable. Executive Director Alan Essig indicates that once you count people and businesses that lack means of payment, you are left with people who deliberately evade their responsibilities. Even when they are arrested, they are unlikely to disfigure in the full amount due to them. To raise the level of implementation will give more money, but only how unclear it is, he said. \"Are we talking about 3 million, 30 million, 300 million?\" Esig said so. \"I don't know what the dollar is, and I don't think anyone knows it.\" The Carter proposal to track down deviant taxpayers is not new. Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" By Haley Bimeler: 26 January 2021, Georgia was probably the largest push to go after tax fraud when Sonny Birdo was governor and Bart Graham was revenue commissioner. We withdrew a report showing that Graham identified 420,693 taxpayers owed $1.6 billion in September 2003. Some of these debts date back to 1988. Graham chased money on several fronts. For example, $23 million came when the State refused to renew liquor licences for businesses with outstanding taxes. The last $18.6 million came when the state began to expose them by posting their names on the Internet. It was just said that the strong enforcement campaign undertaken by the State over two years raised $172.5 million - only 11 per cent of what was due. \"This is a much more chaotic process than Carter suggests,\" said Barbara Nobby, Professor of Political Science at the Kensau State University, which specializes in public budgeting and public finance. \"There's no automatic money that comes when the messages come out.\" This is because the collection will be addressed through regulatory enforcement. The same laws that gave State agencies broad tax enforcement powers gave people the right to appeal. The hearing may take months and years, especially if the offenders employ enforcement lawyers. There is also the question that some deviant taxpayers may have legitimate reasons for not paying them - and therefore they are not already indebted, as Nobby said. The Chairman of the Council of State Appropriations Committee Terry England, R-O'Bourne, said that there were complications, even if the State could collect the amount from the late taxes claimed by Carter. \"No one disputes their position in education,\" said England. But this is one-time money. The question is: What about next year? He said. We went back to Thomas on some of the concerns expressed. Thomas said: \"Son Carter never said that this is the only way to pay for the educational investments we need.\" \"I have defined it as one of several ways to invest in our schools.\" Thomas said that other efforts, such as reducing waste and improving efficiency in government, would provide sustainable funding for schools. So where does this leave us? Carter said he thought the state could raise a lot of money to help education by pursuing deviant taxpayers. State experience - and a report from government auditors - suggests that this may be more challenging than suggested. Carter has a point. But there are many missing contexts from his proposal.
