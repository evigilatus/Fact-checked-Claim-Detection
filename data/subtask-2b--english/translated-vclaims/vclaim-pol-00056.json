We have heard a lot of discussions about what medical care can ultimately cost everyone, but these specific figures have been new for us. The health plan of Sin Bernie Sanders, also supported by Sen Elizabeth Warren, leaves many details that still have to be painted. We were curious where these figures came from, and how they could be extracted. So we decided to dig. The figures we called in the Paiden campaign, which told us that the figure was derived from a 4% rounding of income tax, plus a 7.5% salary tax - the funding mechanisms that Sanders proposed. When you do the math, it indicates that the family that makes $60,000 will see the tax increase that Paden's expecting. But these mathematics are problematic at many levels. For example, the Sanders Bill does not in fact propose funding for medical care for all through combined income tax of 4% and salary tax of 7.5%. The draft law does not contain any funding mechanism at all. In a separate document, Sanders speaks of different ways of paying for the system - these are two examples of paying wages. But they're not the only ones, and Saunders is filming this list as \"a number of options to start a discussion.\" On January 14, 2021, Chuck Grasley stated in a tweet that insulin prices had \"lost the RoOOF for patients/taxpayers bc from the manufacturer, a health plan and PBM Biz practices.\" By Madison Black: 2 February 2021, so the suggestion that medical care for all would specifically increase taxes is an inaccurate reflection of the bill. Another issue is that there is no good sense of what this health plan will cost, and therefore any estimate of the tax burden it will bear is in fact just a guess. Gerard Anderson, Professor of Health Policy at Johns Hopkins University, said, \"There are so many unknown that you can't say anything decisive.\" He added what Bayden said \"can be true,\" but \"there is no evidence of either case.\" Taxes for costs and another issue, as Elaine Meera said, is a health economist at Dartmouth College. In other words, highlighting the potential tax burden of medical care for all without discussing the overall costs is misleading, as she said. Meera referred to the research carried out by the Kaiser Family Foundation, which concluded that the average family-care plan of $20,000 by the employer was for premiums. This, as economists say, leads to lower wages for employees. Many argue that if employers are exempted from this cost, this will translate into people earning far higher wages than their own. Meera said: \"A tax of $5,000, or $6,000, is very small compared to the monetary wages that middle-class families give to obtain employer-sponsored coverage.\" Our rule, Payden, used an unusual level of specificity to describe how medical care for all would affect families that earn between $50,000 and $75,000 a year. These numbers do not come out of thin air, but rely on too many assumptions to be relied upon. It does not accurately reflect what we know about the cost of this plan, or to what extent specific new taxes are proposed. This allegation contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts and assumes more than the evidence justifies. We mostly rate it wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00056"}
