Media reports raised questions about Carson's version of being violent when he was a child and whether he had been offered a scholarship in West Point. So a retired neurosurgeon has a question about his resume in November 10. \"Are you worried about your campaign -- which I've always said, sir, older than you -- The discussant of the Fox Commercial Network asked Neal Cafoto. Carson changed the subject to call Hillary Clinton a liar for her comments as Foreign Minister about the attack in Benghazi. \"When I look at someone like Hillary Clinton, who sits there and says her daughter and a government official that no, this was a terrorist attack, \"Wherever I come from, they call this a lie.\" We have decided to verify the truth of Carson's account of the conflicting statements made by Clinton and whether that indicates that she is lying. Carson has a point that Clinton told some people that the attacks were a terrorist act. But it's not accurate when he says she told \"everyone\" it was a video. Her general remarks were more than Carson suggested. What Clinton said about Benghazi has built up the verification of the facts of the Benghazi attacks on news stories, government press releases and congressional investigations, as well as the information we received from the Carson and Clinton campaigns. As we mentioned earlier, there was initial confusion about the cause of the attack at the time it occurred. One of the key questions was whether Ambassador Susan Rice to the United Nations deliberately underestimated the idea that it was a terrorist attack when she spoke in five talk shows on Sundays after the incident, instead suggesting that it should be an spontaneous reaction to a film mocking Islam. That film provoked protests around the Middle East at about the same time as the Benghazi attack. These are Clinton's main comments: September 11, 2012: attack on an American diplomatic compound begins at 3.40 p.m. At 9.40 a.m. in Benghazi, the attack on the CIA mission facility begins at 6 p.m. ............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Four Americans died in the attacks. 11 September 2012: during a telephone call with Libyan President Mohammed Maghrif at approximately 2000 hours. Clinton stated that she understood the supporters of Sharia, a group affiliated with Al-Qaida, who claimed responsibility for the attacks, according to observations from that conversation documented in an e-mail to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. However, supporters of Sharia quickly retracted their claim. Clinton issued a public statement at 10:08 p.m. that made no mention of a reason for the attack, but said: \"Some have sought to justify this brutal behaviour in response to incitements published on the Internet. \"At 11:12 p.m., Clinton sent an e-mail to her daughter Chelsea saying: \"Two of our officers were killed in Benghazi by a kida-like group. The ambassador you took and a young communications officer on a temporary assignment, wife and two young children. A very difficult day and I fear more than the same.\" September 12, 2012: In a conversation with Egyptian Prime Minister Hisham Kandale, Clinton said: \"We know that the attack in Libya has nothing to do with the film. It was a planned attack - not a protest. On the basis of the information we have seen today, we believe that the group that claimed responsibility for this was linked to Al-Qaida.\" On January 13, 2021, in a story written by General David H. Berger, the commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for the use of marines for security, and told her, \"We are not working for you.\" On January 17, 2021 Butterman, on September 13, 2012: in public remarks with Moroccan Foreign Minister Saaduddin Al-Othman, she condemned the video, saying, \"I also want to take a moment to address the online video that led to these protests in a number of countries.\" Clinton did not, however, say that the video triggered the attack in Benghazi. 14 September 2012: At a ceremony, Clinton said: \"This has been a difficult week for the Foreign Ministry and our country. We have witnessed a severe attack on our position in Benghazi, which has claimed the lives of these brave men. We have seen the anger and violence directed at American embassies on a shocking video on the Internet that has nothing to do with us. The people of Egypt, Libya, Yemen and Tunisia did not exchange the tyranny of the dictator of the mob.\" So I mentioned Benghazi in one sentence and then more broadly \"American Embassies\" in the next sentence. September 20, 2012: At a press conference Clinton spoke of \"protests in several countries around the world,\" and he said, \"As I said, the video that triggered these protests is disgusting and humiliating, and of course, the United States Government had nothing to do with them.\" Clinton Benghazi was not identified in these comments. 21 September 2012: Clinton spoke at a press conference on protests in several cities in Pakistan and said: \"We found the video that lies at the heart of this series of humiliating, disgusting and repulsive events. But that does not provide a justification for violence, and it is therefore important that responsible leaders, but responsible people everywhere, stand up and speak out against violence, especially against those who exploit this difficult moment to advance their extremist ideologies. Yesterday afternoon, when I briefed Congress, I made it clear that keeping our people everywhere in the world safe was our highest priority. What happened in Benghazi was a terrorist attack, and we will not rest until we track down and bring to justice the terrorists who killed four Americans.\" The listener can collect comments on the video and Benghazi, but if you look closely at her statement, she does not. She blames the video on protests in Pakistan, but when she talks about Benghazi later a few sentences, she blames terrorism. Further note: Charles Woods, Tae Woods' father who died in the attack, shared his memoirs after the Clinton meeting on 14 September 2012, for the Fox News report, which was released on 23 October 2015. Woods was in Washington for her testimony on Benghazi and had already testified before the House Committee in 2013. \"I hugged Hillary and shook her hand.\" She said we'd arrest the director responsible for my son's death. In the past, Woods had listed the same conversation to the media beginning in 2012. Our referee Carson said that Clinton told her daughter and a government official that Benghazi was a terrorist attack. However, it oversimplifies many of the statements made by Clinton during the month of the attacks. He has the point that Clinton told her daughter that terrorists had attacked Benghazi and told the Libyan President that a terrorist group had taken responsibility. But those were special comments after hours of attack. Carson got lost when he said she told everyone it was a video. The day after the attack, I told the Egyptian Prime Minister that he had nothing to do with the film. At other times, Clinton spoke of the video but did not say that it caused the attacks. At other times, she blamed the video more widely for protests in different places. One of the victims' family members said that Clinton blamed him for his son's death, but we didn't find the same feeling expressed in any of his public comments. Carson is oversimplification and distortion of Clinton's comments to portray a complex situation in the worst possible light. We're mostly assessing his statement wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05745"}
