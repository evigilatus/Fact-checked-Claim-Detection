Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., really mean no more Medicare for senior citizens?\nIt\u2019s an attack on Baldwin made by Leah Vukmir, her Republican challenger \u00a0\u2014 who even goes so far as to say the bill would \"literally throw grandma off the cliff.\"\nThat\u2019s a reference to PolitiFact National\u2019s Lie of the Year for 2011 \u2014 a false claim that Republicans had -- via a plan from Wisconsin Republican Paul Ryan -- to end Medicare. (A web video produced by a liberal group showed a Ryan look-alike pushing an old woman in a wheelchair off a cliff.)\nVukmir is essentially repeating a claim President Donald Trump made in an opinion article he wrote for USA Today. \u00a0\nLet\u2019s dig into what she said.\n\n\n\n\nAll our Tammy Baldwin and Leah Vukmir fact checks in the U.S. Senate race.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nVukmir\u2019s claim\nIn the third and final debate before the Nov. 6, 2018 election, Vukmir turned a discussion about pre-existing medical conditions to Medicare for All.\nIn the Oct. 19, 2018 debate in Milwaukee, she said:\nSenator Baldwin wants to talk about going backwards. Going backwards is telling seniors that you no longer have your Medicare and your Medicare Advantage. I can\u2019t believe that Senator Baldwin wants to literally throw grandma off the cliff. That\u2019s exactly what she\u2019s doing. This would create chaos of epic proportions. She doesn\u2019t understand her own bill.\n\n\n\n\nAll our Tony Evers and Scott Walker fact checks in the governor\u2019s race.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nSo, what Vukmir is claiming is that the Medicare for All plan supported by Baldwin means senior citizens would \"no longer have\" Medicare.\nWhat is Medicare for All?\nMedicare is the federal government\u2019s health insurance program that is primarily for people age 65 and over older, but also for some younger people with disabilities.\nAs PolitiFact National reported in a recent explainer about Medicare, the financially stressed $600 billion-a-year program serves 58 million people -- almost one out of six Americans.\nSanders, the independent U.S. Senator from Vermont who ran for president as a Democrat in 2016, introduced his Medicare for All bill in September 2017. It\u2019s been referred to a Senate committee, but nothing more has been done with it.\n\n\n\n\nLike us on Facebook.

Patients would be allowed to go to any provider, not be limited by a network.\nSo, that\u2019s enhanced coverage for seniors -- not taking coverage away.\nVukmir\u2019s evidence\nTo back Vukmir\u2019s claim, her campaign cited an opinion column in the New York Post published three days before the debate.\nThe column is by Betsy McCaughey, a senior fellow at the conservative London Center for Policy Research and a former lieutenant governor of New York state. (She earned a Pants on Fire for making a statement that was part of PolitiFact\u2019s 2009 Lie of the Year on \"death panels.\")\nMcCaughey writes that Sanders\u2019 Medicare for All \"abolishes Medicare,\" a point Vukmir has trumpeted. She argues that the program would not be financially viable, saying:\nOn paper, the new program guarantees hospital care, doctors\u2019 visits, even dental, vision and long-term care, all paid for by Uncle Sam. Here\u2019s the hitch: Hospitals will be forced to operate under conditions of extreme scarcity, with too little revenue and more patients than ever.\n\nRight now, Medicare shortchanges hospitals, paying them less than the full cost of caring for seniors. But hospitals accept the low payments, because they can shift the unmet costs to younger patients who have private insurance that pays more.\n\nBut in the new scheme, hospitals will be paid at Medicare rates for all their patients, not just seniors (Sec. 611). With everyone on Medicare for All, no cost-shifting will be possible.\nWhat would ultimately happen if Medicare for All ever became law, of course, is unknown, though there are plenty of questions.\nFor example, health care policy expert Robert Moffit at the conservative Heritage Foundation, told us that with Medicare, \"the addition of new benefits, procedures and the availability of new medical technologies has traditionally lagged behind private (insurance) plans.\"\nBut as proposed -- as even the expert cited by Vukmir acknowledges -- Medicare for All would offer senior citizens more coverage.\nOur rating\nVukmir says Baldwin\u2019s \"Medicare for All\" means senior citizens would \"no longer have\" Medicare.\nMedicare, along with other government and private health insurance programs, would be replaced if Medicare for All ever became law.\nBut it\u2019s not as though senior citizens would lose Medicare and be left with nothing. In fact, as proposed, Medicare for All would provide them more benefits than they get with current Medicare.\nVukmir\u2019s statement has an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression \u2014 our definition of Mostly False.
