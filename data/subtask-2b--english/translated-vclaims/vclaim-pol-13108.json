The former Congressman of Georgia made it official in the campaign video on his website, as he had pointed out earlier in the week. Rog Jingrik qualified by listing achievements during his four years as Speaker of the House of Representatives, which began in January 1995 and ended in January 1999. These achievements included the reduction of unemployment, which stood at 9 per cent in April 2011 and one of the biggest problems in the country. \"The unemployment fell from 5.6 per cent to less than 4,\" said Jingerick, the Republican who now lives in Virginia, in the video. Given that Republican candidates are likely to attack President Barack Obama because of the unemployment rate as the presidential race heats up, Jingrik &apos; s claim may seem to have a solution to the problem or at least be able to argue that he is capable of doing better than the Democratic President. In this context, we wanted to check Jingrich's numbers. In January 1995, the country &apos; s unemployment rate was 5.6 per cent in the month that Gangrich took the hammer as a speaker. The unemployment rate fell to 4.4 per cent by December 1998, the month Jingrik announced that he would resign as a speaker. The rate declined by 10 percentage points by January 1999, when Jingrik resigned. Every ten percentage points at that time equals about 50,000 unemployed Americans. The unemployment rate had not fallen to less than 4 per cent by September 2000, 21 months later. In April 1998, the unemployment rate was 4.3 per cent. An e-mail to a Gingerik spokesman was not received immediately late on Wednesday. Jingrik was right about the unemployment rate when he became the Speaker of the House of Representatives and it was true that it had not fallen, but he was wrong to say that it had fallen to 4 percent during his term as Speaker. The lowest rate of beatings during his speaking time was 4.3 per cent. He could easily have looked for it and fixed it. We're assessing his claim as wrong. On January 13, 2021, the distinguished fact-finding bloggers announced in a story in which General David H. Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for the use of marines for inaugural security, saying, \"We are not working for you.\"", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13108"}
