Our original fact-check, based \u00a0largely on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, found that a claim by the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence was Mostly True. However, readers brought significant new information to light that we thought warranted a new analysis -- and ultimately a new ruling. We are committed to finding the facts even if they emerge after we\u2019ve published.\nIn the wake of the Reynolds High School shooting in Troutdale that left two students dead June 10, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, one of the nation\u2019s leading gun control advocacy groups, has once again been urging parents to lock up guns and ammunition in separate gun lockers.\nThe claim:\nAt a June 17, 2014, rally in Vancouver, Brady Campaign representatives claimed that, on average, nine children across the U.S. die every day from gunshot wounds. The group set up a display showing nine pairs of children\u2019s shoes and a chalkboard that read: \"9 kids every day will never have another birthday.\"\nWere Emilio Hoffman, the victim at Reynolds, and Jared Padgett, the shooter, just two of nine children who die from gun violence on any given day? PolitiFact Oregon wanted to find out.\nThe analysis:\nIn an email, Brady Campaign spokeswoman Jennifer Fuson said the number is based on a five-year average of government data recording children who died from gunshot wounds. The ages range from infants to 19.\nUsing the same age range, we obtained the same numbers from an online database maintained by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. From 2007 to 2011, the most recent data available, 14,258 children died as a result of gunshot wounds.\nThe circumstances range widely: accidental shootings by adults, kids who gained access to unsecured guns, gang violence, suicide and planned shootings like the incident at Reynolds High School on June 10, 2014.\nThe numbers work out to 7.81 deaths a day, about one fewer than the Brady Campaign claimed.\nWe presented this information to Heidi Yewman, a member of the national Brady Campaign board, who organized the rally. She acknowledged that the number presented at the rally was incorrect.\nA volunteer accidentally wrote the wrong number on the chalkboard display, she said. Nine children are unintentionally shot and survive every day, she said, but those children are in addition to the eight who are shot \u2014 intentionally and unintentionally \u2014 and die.\n\"It\u2019s really important we don\u2019t exaggerate the number, because it undermines what we\u2019re saying,\" Yewman said in a phone interview. \"That was unfortunate and somewhat misleading.\"\nShe added: \"Certainly there was no conspiracy to mislead the public.\"\nThe national Brady Campaign spokeswoman confirmed the figure. \"It is correct to say that 8 children and teens die from gun violence every day,\" Fuson said in an email. \"It is also correct to say that 9 children and teens are shot unintentionally.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe checked the nonfatal number as well and found that 8.86 children are unintentionally shot each day and survive, according to the CDC\u2019s nonfatal injuries database.\nBut those two numbers \u2014\u00a0eight gun-related deaths and nine injuries per day \u2014 do not show the whole picture.\nPolitiFact Oregon obtained a breakdown by age from the CDC\u2019s online database and found that about half of all youth gun deaths \u2014 7,223 of 14,258 \u2014 are 18- and 19-year-olds. The same goes for unintentional injuries, roughly 46 percent of which \u2014 7,479 of 16,172 \u2014 are 18- and 19-year-olds.\nRemove those two years from the calculation, and there are an average of 4.76 unintentional injuries each day and 3.85 deaths.\nThat is significant given the use of the word \"children\" in the Brady Campaign\u2019s display, along with a chalkboard and shoes suited to children younger than 12. In addition, people 18 and older are legally considered adults. They are allowed to buy guns and ammunition without parental consent, and are solely responsible for crimes they commit using those weapons.\nWe asked Fuson, the Brady Campaign spokeswoman, to find out why the campaign includes 18- and 19-year-olds in its calculation. In an email, she said the campaign used the CDC\u2019s own metrics for measuring unintentional injuries. She pointed us to a report published by the center examining childhood injuries from 2000-06.\nThe CDC did use data for ages 0-19, including injuries. The center uses the same age range in The National Action Plan for Child Injury Prevention. \u00a0\nThe CDC is the nation\u2019s leading authority on mortality and injury statistics. The federal database includes information on thousands of death and emergency room records, and is regularly cited by lawmakers and activist groups. Data is categorized by four-year age ranges \u2014 15-19 year olds, for example \u2014 in addition to many other metrics such as year, race and sex of victims. Users can also search the CDC website for statistics by any age or range.\nIt is important to note, however, that the CDC says its data for unintentional gun injuries among children 16 and younger is shaky because the samples sizes are small.\nAnother wrinkle: The agency has been caught in political cross-fire, with right-wing critics saying it collects and presents data in a way that supports gun-control efforts. Liberal supporters, meanwhile, say that criticism has had a chilling effect on CDC research into gun injuries and deaths. In short, not everyone agrees CDC data are unassailable.\nLast year, President Barack Obama ordered the CDC, in the wake of the Newtown, Connecticut, shootings, to begin studying the causes of gun violence. That information is not yet available.\nThe ruling:\nAt a rally in Vancouver, Brady Campaign representatives claimed that, on average, nine children across the U.S. die every day from gunshot wounds. The group set up a display showing nine pairs of children\u2019s shoes and a chalkboard that read: \"9 kids every day will never have another birthday.\"\nPolitiFact Oregon checked that claim against government data using the Brady Campaign\u2019s age range of 0-19, and found that about 7.81 children and teens die each day from gun violence, based on the most recent five-year average available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Heidi Yewman, who organized the rally in Vancouver, said the incorrect number was a volunteer\u2019s mistake.\nWe found the difference between eight and nine not hugely significant. It\u2019s horrible that children are dying of gunshot wounds, of course, but the difference in the two numbers is unlikely to materially change the debate about gun control.\nBut including 18- and 19-year-olds, who are not \"children\" under legal and other definitions, significantly skews the numbers, making the problem seem much worse than it is. Because the group\u2019s claim contained an element of truth but ignored critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.\nReturn to OregonLive.com/politics to comment on this article.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07677"}
