Here\u2019s the full text:\n\u00a0\n\nVoiceover (VO): Kitzhaber failed Oregon because his answer is always the same.\n\nJohn Kitzhaber: I have probably had more tax increases attached to my name -- proposals I oughta say \u00a0-- than any other governor. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nVO: Now he\u2019s at it again.\n\nJohn Kitzhaber: Obviously, a retail sales tax is one of the options.\n\nVO: Even worse, Kitzhaber says we need a sales tax so people without jobs pay taxes.\n\nVO: Taxing the unemployed? \u00a0We need jobs, not more taxes.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Boysko\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in a committee debate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe United States is the only industrialized, modernized country that does not already have a paid family medical leave program in place.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVO: John Kitzhaber, even his new ideas are old. \u00a0It\u2019s time for a new direction.\n\nIn the ad, the Dudley campaign pulls this from an Oct. 8 Portland Tribune article:\n\n\"Kitzhaber did not hesitate to use the \u2018sales tax\u2019 term.... As incomes shrink and the number of jobless remains high, he said, it illustrates more clearly why Oregon needs to stop depending so much on personal income ....\" \u00a0(Dudley emphasis)\n\n\nSqueezing taxes from the unemployed to prop up state spending? How mean!\n\nBut take a look at the words from the story left out of the ad: \"Kitzhaber did not hesitate to use the \"sales tax\" term, though he said it\u2019s just one of the options that should be under discussion so the state is not so reliant on income taxes. \u00a0As incomes shrink and the number of jobless remains high, he said, it illustrates more clearly why Oregon needs to stop depending so much on personal income taxes to pay for the bulk of its general fund budget.\" (our emphasis)\n\nVery sneaky.\n\nKitzhaber has long advocated for a sales tax to help stabilize Oregon\u2019s roller-coaster reliance on personal and corporate income taxes. The Portland Tribune article clearly shows that Kitzhaber was not advocating a sales tax as a means to get more money out of the out-of-work, but to increase the diversity of Oregon\u2019s tax base. An August 2010 study by The Tax Foundation confirmed Oregon\u2019s heavy reliance on individual income taxes, ranking the state No. 2, just after Maryland.\n\nBut before handing down a ruling, PolitiFact Oregon wanted to check out tax burdens in Washington and in Oregon, just to see how a sales tax would affect the poor, which presumably includes many folks out of work. Oregon taxes income -- including unemployment compensation, as does the federal government -- but not sales. Washington does not tax income, but assesses a base 6.5 percent tax on goods. In Seattle, the sales tax is 9.5 percent.\n\nWe found an interesting study by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a liberal think tank out of Washington, D.C. Its November 2009 report found that Washington was the most regressive state in the country, where households in the lowest 20 percent spend about 17.3 percent of their income on taxes. In Oregon, the figure for that income group is 8.7 percent. The average among states is 10.9 percent. Clearly, it\u2019s a burden to be poor in Washington.\n\nKitzhaber never said anything about implementing a sales tax to make sure the unemployed pay into Oregon\u2019s tax base. We rate this Pants on Fire: The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.\n\n\u00a0\n\nComment on this item.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-14166"}
