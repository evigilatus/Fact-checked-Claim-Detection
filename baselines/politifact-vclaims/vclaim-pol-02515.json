And as late as 2025, the center projected, 25.3 percent of the benefits would flow to the top 1 percent.\nThe main reason: By 2027, a number of key tax provisions that benefit middle-income taxpayers will have expired unless Congress extends them. In addition, the new tax law changed how inflation was calculated, in a way that will be less generous to taxpayers as time goes on.\n\"How much of the benefit of the tax bill goes to the top 1 percent income group greatly depends on what year you are looking at,\" said Joseph Rosenberg, a senior research associate at the Tax Policy Center.\nOur ruling\nThe DNC said that the Republicans \"passed a tax bill that gave 80 percent of its benefits to the top 1 percent.\"\nThat\u2019s the case by 2027, due to the expiration of several important middle-income tax cuts and a change in how inflation is calculated. However, through 2025, the share of benefits going to the top 1 percent is much smaller, at roughly 20 percent to 25 percent. The DNC is cherry-picking by focusing on the tax bill\u2019s impact by 2027, rather than the impact for the nearly a decade leading up to then.\nWe rate the statement Half True.\n Share the Facts 2018-01-16 22:36:09 UTC   PolitiFact    4 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Half True  The Republicans and President Donald Trump \"passed a tax bill that gave 80 percent of its benefits to the top 1 percent.\"    Democratic National Committee national Democratic organization https://medium.com/@TheDemocrats/trump-at-one-year-president-for-the-1-92d19feb4996   a Medium post Tuesday, January 16, 2018 2018-01-16    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02515"}
