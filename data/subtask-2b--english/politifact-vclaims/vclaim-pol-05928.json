Bush 'created a dynamic effect of high growth'", "text": "During his 2016 Republican presidential bid, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush has periodically had to answer for the record of his brother, George W. Bush, and he had to do it again on a recent edition of Fox News Sunday.\nHost Chris Wallace asked Bush, \"Whether it was Ronald Reagan's tax cuts or your brother's tax cuts, they did add greatly to the deficit.\"\nBush responded, \"They didn't (add to the deficit) as greatly as the static thinkers on the left think. They created a dynamic effect of high growth. And that's what we need.\"\nWe didn\u2019t recall rapid economic growth under Bush, so we thought we\u2019d look at the past five presidents\u2019 records in order to gauge Jeb Bush\u2019s comments.\nWe\u2019ll start by noting that boiling down a president\u2019s policies over one or two terms is tricky. For instance, in Reagan\u2019s case, he is generally thought of as an aggressive tax-cutter, and it\u2019s certainly true that he cut taxes sharply early in his term. But he also raised taxes. We gave a Mostly True rating to a recent claim by TV host Stephen Colbert that Reagan \"raised taxes when revenues did not match the expectations.\"\nFor this reason, we\u2019ll focus here on the most straightforward measure -- overall growth rates under each president.\nA look at the numbers\nWe chose three measurements for comparing the five presidents. The most important statistic is the broadest one: the average annual increase in inflation-adjusted gross domestic product. Here\u2019s a rundown of how the past five presidents have done on that score:\n\n\n\n\nRank\n\n\nPresident\n\n\nAverage annual GDP increase, inflation-adjusted\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nClinton\n\n\n3.9\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nReagan\n\n\n3.5\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nGeorge H.W.

Bush ranks second to last, undercutting Bush\u2019s argument.\nWhat about the other yardsticks we checked? Bush did a bit better on these, though generally in the middle of the pack.\nHere\u2019s how the presidents compare when measured by their single best year of inflation-adjusted GDP growth:\n\n\n\n\nRank\n\n\nPresident\n\n\nBest year of inflation-adjusted GDP growth\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nReagan\n\n\n7.3\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nClinton\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.7\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nGeorge W.

Bush\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nObama\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nSo Bush fares better on these other two measurements, but he still trails the two clear frontrunners in economic growth, Clinton and Reagan.\nComparing Bush and Obama\nWe should note that George W. Bush\u2019s record on GDP growth does outpace Obama\u2019s on each score, so to the extent that Jeb Bush was using Obama -- the president Bush hopes to succeed -- as a foil, he has a point. Still, it\u2019s an exaggeration to tout George W. Bush\u2019s economic record as one of \"high growth\" when compared to the records of Clinton and Reagan, and even to Bush\u2019s father.\nAs for Obama\u2019s record, we\u2019ll note that -- as low as it is on our rankings -- it\u2019s still a work in progress.\nTo calculate Obama\u2019s record, we included the first two quarters of 2015. (Data for the third quarter is set to be released in October.) Given that Obama came into office in the midst of the Great Recession and that the recovery on his watch has been accelerating since 2010 -- albeit slowly -- Obama may ultimately overtake Bush when his final tally is available. Second-quarter growth for 2015 was 3.9 percent, which could suggest continued economic improvement in the months ahead.\nThe Bush campaign\u2019s response\nWhen we checked with Jeb Bush\u2019s campaign, they made the point that because Wallace\u2019s question referred to both Reagan and George W. Bush, Jeb Bush\u2019s response was intended to refer to both presidents. But Reagan\u2019s record on tax cuts was far more mixed than Bush\u2019s; Reagan signed off on several significant tax increases.\nThe Bush campaign also told PolitiFact that George W. Bush\u2019s record is hampered by beginning with the economic impact of the 9/11 attacks and the bursting of the dot-com bubble. However, the same argument could be made -- and made even more strongly -- with the Great Recession inherited by Obama.\nAllocating credit and blame\nFinally, we will raise an issue that\u2019s always relevant when comparing presidents on economic growth: It\u2019s hard to determine credit or blame for economic performance on a president\u2019s watch, because factors outside their control, from energy-price shocks to technological changes to pure luck, can have a significant impact. In addition, it\u2019s unclear how much a president can influence the broader economy during their first year or two in office; for that early period, the legacy of their predecessor may have a greater impact.\n\"The economics research is mixed as to how much federal tax policies can affect economic growth,\" said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist and chief economist at the jobs site Indeed.\nOur ruling\nJeb Bush said the tax policies of George W. Bush \"created a dynamic effect of high growth.\"\nThe definition of \"high,\" of course, is relative, but if you look at the most directly comparable examples -- the past five presidents\u2019 records in average, annual, inflation-adjusted growth in gross domestic product -- George W. Bush ranked fourth among the five presidents, and trailed the two strongest presidents in this regard, Clinton and Reagan, by a particularly wide margin. (Reagan\u2019s policies included both tax cuts and tax increases.)\nBush has so far maintained a lead over Obama, although Obama\u2019s tenure is not finished yet. Still, it\u2019s always worth noting that a president\u2019s impact on the economy is not all-encompassing.\nOverall, though, the evidence doesn\u2019t show that high growth occurred in the wake of the Bush tax cuts. We rate the claim Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05928"}
