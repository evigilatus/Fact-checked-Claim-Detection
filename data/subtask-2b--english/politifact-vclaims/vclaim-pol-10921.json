Paul Broun, R-Athens, has not authored any legislation that has been adopted by Congress, according to an article in The Walton Tribune.\n\n\"Nothing he has introduced has ever passed,\" Simpson, who will face off with Broun in the Republican Party primary on July 31, told PolitiFact Georgia. \"That\u2019s a statement of fact.\"\n\nNot true, Broun\u2019s office said. \n\nPolitiFact Georgia wondered who was correct here?\n\nBroun has successfully added several amendments to bills that his office says could have been done as separate legislation. The congressman\u2019s representatives also say those amendments have an impact. Simpson said amendments are added to bills in Congress like sugar in coffee. Broun\u2019s amendments, Simpson said, aren\u2019t that impressive.\n\nBroun was first elected to the House of Representatives in July 2007 in a special election after the death of Charlie Norwood. He has served three terms.\n\nSimpson\u2019s campaign website describes the challenger as a retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel who says he will be \"a patriot, not a politician.\"\n\n\"I think the message [Simpson is] trying to get across is Broun is ineffective,\" longtime University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock said.\n\nThe congressman has a near-perfect lifetime score of 99.2 on his voting record, as determined by the American Conservative Union, whose board consists of former GOP members of the George W. Bush administration and former Republican members of Congress. Broun\u2019s score was higher than U.S. House Speaker John Boehner.\n\nBroun has proposed resolutions to make 2010 the year of the Bible and pushed for a Ten Commandments week and authored such legislation. He also authored a resolution to amend the Constitution to allow for the castration of anyone convicted of raping a child under age 16. The resolution was referred to the House subcommittee on the Constitution, civil rights and civil liberties. He\u2019s been a vocal proponent of major cuts in federal spending.\n\nBullock said being ultraconservative may have helped Broun in his former district. Broun\u2019s new district has portions of metro Atlanta counties that are less rural and, perhaps, less conservative, Bullock said.\n\n\"Certainly, Broun is one of the most conservative members [of Congress],\" Bullock said.\n\nSimpson sent us a link to the website Open Congress, which tracks legislation. It says Broun sponsored 21 bills in the current congressional term and none passed. Georgia\u2019s 12 other House members have sponsored 157 pieces of legislation since January 2011. Only three have been made into law.\n\nPolitiFact Georgia reviewed each piece of legislation Broun has filed since 2007. Most of his bills were forwarded to various House committees. There were a handful of amendments to bills and resolutions that Broun sponsored that did pass. They included:\n\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJake Tapper\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in remarks in a CNN broadcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second presidential impeachment of Donald Trump was \u201cthe most bipartisan impeachment in American history.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHouse Amendment 353, which reduced the funding for the Office of the Under Secretary for Management in the State Department by $600,000 and applied the savings to the spending reduction account. It was agreed to by a voice vote on June 1, 2011, congressional records show. The amendment was to a continuing appropriations act that was introduced on May 26, 2011, for spending through October 2011.\n\n\n\n\nHouse Amendment 647, which reduced the operating budget of the Office of the Secretary of Energy by $2.5 million and applies the savings to the spending reduction account. It was agreed to by a voice vote July 13. The amendment was to an energy and water bill filed June 24.\n\n\n\nBroun\u2019s congressional office sent us other amendments that were approved by the House. Some, it said, are effectively legislation and as important as a standard bill. One agreed to in 2009 required that the Energy Department give Congress an annual report describing activities taken in the prior year, a strategic funding plan and other details. Other amendments reduced spending in the Office of the Secretary of Energy by $2.5 million, cutting funding by $181,500 from the Marine Mammal Commission and reducing $878,000 in spending by the Congressional Research Service.\n\nSimpson said the amendments are not comparable to standard resolutions because the amount of money involved is minute in comparison to the federal budget, which is more than $3 trillion.\n\n\"In the scheme of things, it\u2019s not that much money,\" Simpson said. \n\nKyle Kondik, who follows House races at the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics, noted that the House was under Democratic control during Broun\u2019s first three years in Congress. It\u2019s very difficult for a younger member of the minority party to get legislation passed, Kondik said. Broun\u2019s position on some issues to the right of GOP House leadership may not have endeared the congressman with those who have the power to shepherd his legislation into law, Kondik said.\n\nThe number of bills authored by Broun that have passed \"may or may not be a true measure of his performance as a congressman,\" Kondik said.\n\nBullock said there may be some reasons why the representative has not had more resolutions passed.\n\n\"He\u2019s not particularly [a senior member of Congress],\" Bullock said. \"He\u2019s not chair of a committee. He\u2019s not really in a position to enact legislation.\"\n\nBroun has authored some amendments that have been approved by the majority of his fellow House members. There have been a handful of resolutions that passed as well. The experts we spoke with offered some context that offers the congressman a defense, such as the difficulty of being a Republican attempting to get legislation passed when Democrats controlled Congress. With that context, we rate Simpson\u2019s claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10921"}
