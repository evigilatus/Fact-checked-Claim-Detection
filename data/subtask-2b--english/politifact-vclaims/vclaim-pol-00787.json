Kennedy Jr. didn\u2019t tout a Donald Trump presidency in George magazine", "text": "Conspiracy theories about the assassination of former president John F. Kennedy abound, but the 2010s have ushered in a new wave of claims, like one that President Donald Trump says a daily prayer to the old commander-in-chief. Other allegations center on Kennedy\u2019s son, John F. Kennedy\u00a0Jr. He died in a plane crash in July 1999. Depending on the source, though, he either faked his death or was killed to clear Hillary Clinton\u2019s political path. And \u2014 according to an April 1 Facebook post\u00a0\u2014 he once praised Trump as a formidable presidential candidate.\n\"If my dear friend Donald Trump ever decided to sacrifice his fabulous billionaire lifestyle to become president he would be an unstoppable force for ultimate justice that Democrats and Republicans alike would celebrate,\" reads the text above a photo of Trump and Kennedy posted to Facebook on April 1. The quote is attributed to Kennedy and includes a citation: George magazine, June 1999.\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) That\u2019s probably because Kennedy never said that in that issue of George, or ever, as far as we can tell.\nLiam Neeson appeared on the cover that month, and the issue includes stories featuring the actor, Ariana Huffington and tobacco lawyers. Ann Coulter wrote a column about Washington D.C.\u2019s dating scene. But Trump isn\u2019t mentioned in the magazine\u2019s pages.\nKennedy was the president and editor-in-chief of George, and he wrote an editor\u2019s letter that skips from Star Wars to then-Sen. John McCain to campaign finance reform.\nWe wondered if Kennedy made the statement about Trump elsewhere, but we couldn\u2019t find it when we looked for news coverage online. The closest match was a November 2016 New York Post story that says Kennedy\u2019s former business partner, Michael Berman, recalled a moment in 1996 when Kennedy flew a group of advertisers to Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the story:\n\n\"As frequently happened to Kennedy at his events, talk soon turned to whether he could envision himself running for president. Trying to deflect the presidential chatter, Kennedy noted that the Trump estate was far more glamorous than a Kennedy family compound a few miles away. \u2018I think you should be asking those questions of Donald,'\u00a0Kennedy said, according to Berman.\u00a0\u2018He\u2019d clearly have the most extravagant winter White House.\u2019\"\n\nWe also searched the Nexis database of U.S. publications for any mentions of John F. Kennedy Jr. and Donald Trump in June 1999. There were two results. The first, a June 24 New York Post story comprised of smaller news items, mentions both men but not in connection to one another. The second, a similar June 9 New York Daily News story, also mentions both, but not together.\n\"John F. Kennedy Jr. is due to spend a few months in a cast after breaking his ankle on Martha\u2019s Vineyard,\" the piece says. \"Friends say he is going slightly stir-crazy.\"\nOur ruling\nKennedy and Trump were not strangers. The photo that appears in the Facebook post is authentic, a shot from March 1999, when the two men watched a New York Knicks game. And while an associate of Kennedy\u2019s said that he once complimented Mar-a-Lago and punted questions about a presidential run to Trump, Kennedy\u00a0didn\u2019t make the fawning statement the Facebook post claims, nor did he say it in his June 1999 magazine.\nWe rate this post as False.\n Share the Facts 2019-04-08 19:55:46 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  John F.
