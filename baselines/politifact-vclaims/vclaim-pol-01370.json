That study showed that 9th District residents making between $50,000 and $75,000 saved $1,337, on average, from the tax cut in 2018.\nCiting a Money Magazine report, Vicenzi explained that FreedomWorks pulled from the $50,000 to $75,000 income bracket to reflect a \"real income\" of about $52,000 that the magazine calculated based on the state\u2019s median household income of $47,830.\nBut Zelenak said the ad\u2019s claim that the tax cuts save \"you\" $1,300 is misleading, since only people with average incomes between $50,000 to $75,000 have actually experienced that amount of savings.\nAccording to the same Tax Foundation analysis, district residents earning $25,000 to $50,000 collected an average of $1,009 in savings, and those with average incomes between $10,000 and $25,000 brought in an average of $156.\nBy contrast, those with yearly incomes higher than $200,000 saved a whopping $24,137. This disparity is not reflected in the ad\u2019s claim.\n\"For a voter in the $10,000 to $25,000 income range, it would be more accurate to say, \u2018McCready wants to repeal tax cuts that save you $156 while saving the average high-income taxpayer in your district over $24,000,\u2019\" Zelenak said.\nZelenak also noted that the ad says nothing about the tax cuts being deficit-financed, which could mean more savings now but higher costs in the future.\n\"Deficits have to be paid for eventually, so that in the long run the tax cuts imply tax increases on \u2018your\u2019 children and grandchildren,\" he said.\n\"But one doesn\u2019t really expect a political ad to raise that point,\" he added.\nOur ruling\nIn an ad seen on Facebook, FreedomWorks said \"Dan McCready wants to repeal tax cuts that saves you $1,300\" or more per year.\nThe $1,300 figure is an accurate average for district residents earning yearly incomes between $50,000 and $75,000, but those with higher or lower incomes will likely receive substantially different tax cuts, ranging from a measly $156 to a whopping $24,000.\nPlus, McCready has repeatedly indicated that while he wants to make serious changes to the Trump tax plan, he does not want to get rid of the tax cuts, especially for the middle class.\nOverall, the ad contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.
