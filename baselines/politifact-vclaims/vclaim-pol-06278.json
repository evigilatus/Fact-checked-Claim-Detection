Scott Walker is touting his record on veterans as he tours the country preparing to make a presidential bid. \u00a0\nAt a \"Politics and Pies\" event May 30, 2015 in New Hampshire, Walker boasted of the success veterans have had finding jobs in Wisconsin.\n\"Nationally the unemployment rate for veterans is far greater than the national unemployment rate,\" Walker said, adding Wisconsin is \"one of those rare examples where unemployment is actually lower for veterans than it is for the population as a whole and certainly lower than it is nationally.\" \u00a0\u00a0\nAre Wisconsin veterans doing that well in the Wisconsin job market? \u00a0\nTo support his claim, Walker's team sent a report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics about veteran and non-veteran employment. This is the best way to make the comparison, as opposed to measuring veterans vs the overall workforce.\nLet\u2019s see how it breaks down.\nThe national picture: Walker said \"nationally, the unemployment rate for veterans is far greater than the national unemployment rate.\" \u00a0\nBut the national unemployment rate for veterans is actually lower than the rate for non-veterans. For veterans, the rate was 5.3 percent, compared to 6 percent for non-veterans. That's true historically as well. \u00a0\nA report from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs shows that from 2000 to 2013, veterans had lower unemployment rates than non-veterans.\nThe Wisconsin picture: Walker also said in Wisconsin \"unemployment is actually lower for veterans than it is for the population.\" \u00a0\nWisconsin's rate for veterans was 4.1 percent while the rate for non-veterans was 5.4 percent. So, the state's veterans are employed at higher rates than their civilian counterparts.\nHow rare is it? In his claim, Walker said Wisconsin\u2019s situation was a \"rare\" one. But 32 other states also had veteran unemployment rates lower than non-veterans. That\u2019s not all that rare.\nWisconsin vs. national: Finally, Walker said Wisconsin's veteran unemployment rate was \"certainly lower than it is nationally.\" \u00a0Federal data confirms this aspect of the claim, with Wisconsin's veteran unemployment rate at 4.1 percent, while nationally the rate was 5.3 percent.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, the data he provided supported two of the four aspects to his claim.\nMore about the data\nComparing the fraction of vets who are unemployed in the state to the fraction of unemployed vets nationally makes sense, said Steven Deller, a professor of economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\nBut unemployment rates don\u2019t necessarily show the whole picture.\nThe data takes an average from the last year\u2019s monthly Current Population Survey of 60,000 households conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau for the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nPeople who have worked at a regular job in the previous week are considered employed, while people who are jobless, looking for a job and available for work are considered unemployed.\nBut the approach doesn\u2019t account for workers who are underemployed or employed outside their field, and doesn\u2019t take into account discouraged workers who stopped looking for a job.\nBLS does calculate other unemployment rates, though they are not often cited by politicians or the media.\nOne is known as the U-6, which takes the total of the unemployed, all persons marginally attached to the labor force and involuntary part-time workers. A rule of thumb puts the U-6 rate as double the conventional unemployment rate.\nThe U-6 rate for Wisconsin is 12.1, while the national rate is 13.8.\nBLS economist Steve Hipple calculated an estimated U-6 rate for veterans nationally at 9.7 percent. BLS doesn\u2019t publish state U-6 rates specifically for veterans, .\nOur rating\nWalker said \"Nationally, the unemployment rate for veterans is far greater than the national unemployment rate,\" and Wisconsin is \"one of those rare examples where unemployment is actually lower for veterans than it is for the population as a whole and certainly lower than it is nationally.\" \u00a0\nData from BLS supported two of the four aspects of his claim and experts cautioned about use of raw statistics.\nOur definition for Half True is a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. That fits here.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06278"}
