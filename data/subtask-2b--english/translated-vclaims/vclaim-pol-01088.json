Data don't agree.", "text": "(Joff) Phil Scott is determined to reverse the decline in the labour force in Vermont. The demographic problems facing the staff group in Vermont were the focus of Scott's opening speech two weeks ago and again at the front and centre during this week's budget address. \"As I have said many times, I think our greatest threat is the decline in our workforce. It is the origin of every problem we face. \"The Governor said to the members of the House of Representatives and the Senate gathered in the Council of State on Thursday. Scott confirmed his point, and he said the whole state is in pain. \"To put this in perspective: Each province, with the exception of Shendon, has seen a decrease in the number of people employed. Each province, including Chitenden, had fewer people available to work.\" The Governor &apos; s observation seems to challenge traditional wisdom that the province of Chitenden, home to the largest city of Vermont and 26 per cent of the total population of the state, is somewhat immune to the demographic conflicts facing the rest of the state. But is the governor right? We have decided to analyse the data ourselves to see how difficult it is to hit the province of Chitenden as a result of the demographic contraction felt elsewhere (for example, Essex has experienced a 20 per cent decline in its workforce). Rebecca Kelly, spokesman for the Governor, said that the source of the claim was the economy of the Department of Labor in Vermont. \"As our Ministry of Economic Labour advised, 'dead people' refer to the technical term 'work force',\" in an e-mail. So we moved on to the Ministry of Labour's latest data, released on January 18. (After publication of this article, Kelly said that the calculations using these data were premature - although there was no indication that the data were provisional. She said that the figures would be finalized in March.) Until this year, the high point for the labour force in the province of Chitenden was 95,835 persons in 2012, according to the Ministry &apos; s annual averages. As of July 2012, the number was 95,869. On January 16, 2021, Jordan Rachel stated in Tweedda that the minimum wage of $15 per hour would raise the price of taco bill burrito to $38. By Bill McCarthy: 20 January 2021, this figure fell for the following year, then rose slightly in 2014, and then declined again to the lowest level on the average of 95 181 in January 2016. But since then, she's been recovering. In mid-2018, for the first time ever, the Chitenden County Labour Force dismantled 96,000 people. The high point was 96,191 in June. There was a decline in the second half of 2018, but seasonal changes in the labour force make data from one month to one month meaningless as an indicator of trends. If Scott had filed the claim during his budget speech last year, he would have been on hard ground: the average labour force in 2017 was about 190 people below the 2012 figures. (We suspect that the Governor was using old data, based on the data table sent by Kelly) but even then, the statement will be missing some critical context. For two consecutive years, the labour force in Chitenden Province has been rising steadily. There has been a sharp upward trend since 2000, when the labour force was only 85,086 on average. This does not mean that Vermont is not facing a serious decline in its workforce. In 10 of the 14 state districts, there is a clear downward trend in the labour force (Washington, Franklin and Grand Island). Our rule: The Governor may have relied on old information when he said that the province of Shendon had fewer people available for work today than in the past. But if we could find the right data, his employees might have done the same thing. The most recent report of the Ministry of Labour - which was issued prior to his budget speech - shows that the workforce in the province of Chitenden reached its highest level in 2018. We appreciate that the governor's claim is wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01088"}
