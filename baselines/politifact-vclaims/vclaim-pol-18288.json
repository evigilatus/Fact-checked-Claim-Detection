The CDC recommends all children receive the vaccine at ages 11-12, though it can be used as early as age 9 and up to age 26.\u00a0\nThe vaccine can prevent cancer-causing HPV infections.\u00a0\nShipley said in the interview he wanted to raise a point that young people have less risk of becoming seriously ill from COVID-19 than older adults. He said young people should return to work, though public health experts say it isn\u2019t safe for them to do so yet.\u00a0\n\"What I\u2019ve seen is a lot of young people are voicing that they\u2019d much rather stay on welfare or unemployment than go back to work, and now they\u2019re kind of complaining that they have to go to work, and they\u2019re saying they don\u2019t feel safe,\" Shipley said. \"I was really upset and kind of angry. And they say they are unsafe, but there\u2019s really no data to support that.\"\u00a0\nWhile older adults are most at risk of dying from COVID-19, young people are not immune. In Iowa, 2 percent of deaths from COVID-19 have been individuals under the age of 40.\u00a0\nIn the U.S, at least 325 people under the age of 35 have died of COVID-19 as of May 6, according to the CDC, though this accounts for less than 1 percent of COVID-19 deaths nationwide.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData from the World Health Organizations indicates that in studies of the HPV vaccine, the rate of serious adverse events was no higher in those who received the vaccine than those who received a placebo injection.\u00a0\nChristine Petersen, director of the Center for Emerging Infectious Disease at the University of Iowa, said in a phone interview the risk of dying of COVID-19 is higher, given that no deaths have ever been linked to the HPV vaccine.\nThe HPV vaccine prevents the most common types of human papillomavirus strains, which can cause cervical and other cancers.\u00a0\n\"Roughly, for every 100,000 people in the state of Iowa, there are five who have had cervical cancer, there\u2019s been zero that have died from the vaccine. We know that across the Iowa population, 7.27 people out of 100,000 have died of coronavirus,\" Peterson said.\u00a0\nShipley said he believes people who are most at risk should be social distancing, while younger adults can return to work.\u00a0\n\"There\u2019s a lot of ways we can protect ourselves and enforce social distancing between myself and my parents and my grandparents or whoever it is,\" Shipley said. \"Just because there are people at risk, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean we all need to stay home, collect government checks, and not go to work.\"\u00a0\nPetersen warned that separating those at-risk from those who are not is not an easy task.\u00a0\n\"I would caution that it\u2019s not so easy to target at risk or not at-risk people,\" Petersen said. \"You can be undiagnosed with a disease that can cause you to be impressively immune compromised and not even know it yourself yet, or you can not want to declare it to the rest of the world.\"\u00a0\nPetersen said COVID-19 still has a reproductive rate of 2 in Iowa, meaning on average, each positive case will spread the virus to two others.\u00a0\n\"Those people may not show symptoms for at least a day, maybe two, so taking precautions isn\u2019t just to protect yourself, it\u2019s to protect those at risk people,\" Petersen said.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nShipley wrote that young people are more at risk from the HPV vaccine than COVID-19. Both the CDC and the WHO have concluded that no deaths have been caused by the HPV vaccine, while young people have died from COVID-19 in the U.S and in Iowa.\u00a0\nWhile young people are less at risk from the coronavirus than older people, adhering to social distancing protects people at risk of having greater complications from the coronavirus \u2013\u00a0including those who might not yet know they are at a higher risk. Moreover, Shipley conceded that he made the statement in order to start a discussion, not to give accurate information that could be taken literally. We rated Shipley\u2019s claim as Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18288"}
