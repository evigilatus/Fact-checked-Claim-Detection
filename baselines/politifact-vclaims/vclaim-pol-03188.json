A Republican district in Georgia that Trump won by 20+ points. Let\u2019s hang on to some perspective, folks.\"\nIt's GEORGIA. A Republican district in Georgia that Trump won by 20+ points. Let's hang on to some perspective, folks. https://t.co/zeis02pRPj\u2014 Joy Reid (@JoyAnnReid) June 21, 2017\n\nReid is right that the district is historically Republican; Republicans have held it for decades, most recently by Tom Price, whose elevation to Health and Human Services secretary by President Donald Trump prompted the special election in the first place.\nHowever, Trump didn\u2019t win the district by more than 20 points \u2014 not by a long shot. (Reid did later tweet\u00a0back to a follower who suggested that Trump won by a point or two,\u00a0\"Ah ok. I could have that one wrong. Thanks!\")\nAccording to the forthcoming Almanac of American Politics 2018, Trump defeated Clinton in the district by 160,029 votes to 155,087, or a 48 percent to 47 percent margin. That\u2019s roughly a 1 percentage-point margin. (Full disclosure: The author of this article is also the senior author of that book.)\nAnother source of presidential results by congressional district, Daily Kos Elections, had a similar number, putting the Trump margin of victory at 1.5 percentage points.\nLike a number of other traditionally Republican suburban congressional districts across the country, Georgia\u2019s 6th District moved toward the Democrats in the 2016 presidential election. Political analysts credited Clinton\u2019s gains in such districts to demographic patterns in each of the candidates\u2019 bases of support. Hillary Clinton tended to do better than Trump did among voters with high educational attainment, who are disproportionately numerous in suburban districts like Georgia\u2019s 6th.\nIn some such districts, Clinton won outright over Trump. These included Texas\u2019 23rd District, held by GOP Rep. Will Hurd, and no fewer than seven Republican-held House districts in California.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeorgia\u2019s 6th District didn\u2019t quite give Clinton the victory, but Trump notched only a narrow win in the district.\nThe 2016 presidential result in the district was far worse for the Republicans than in previous elections. In 2012, according to the Almanac of American Politics, Mitt Romney won the district, 61 percent to 37 percent, a 24 percentage-point margin.\nThat margin is more along the lines of what Reid was talking about. But 2016 was a very different election year from 2012 in the district. Georgia\u2019s 6th District had already moved substantially in the Democrats\u2019 direction by last November. Clinton won some 40,000 more votes in the district than President Barack Obama did in 2012, while Trump won almost 27,000 votes fewer than Mitt Romney did in 2012.\nWorth noting: Even as Trump was faring poorly in the district, Price won his seat by a margin similar to what Reid tweeted. In 2016, Price, a longtime incumbent first elected in 2004, defeated his little-known Democratic opponent, 62 percent to 38 percent, a 24-point margin.\nStill, Reid was wrong in her initial tweet. (She did not respond to an inquiry by Twitter.)\nOur ruling\nReid's original tweet said\u00a0that in Georgia\u2019s 6th district, \"Trump won by 20+ points.\"\nRomney won by that wide a margin margin in 2012, and Price did, too, as recently as last November. But Trump was nowhere near as popular in the district as Reid\u2019s tweet indicates. He won by a point or two -- far worse than Republican candidates have traditionally fared in the 6th.\nWe rate the statement False.\nEDITOR'S NOTE,\u00a0June 21, 12:55 p.m.: Shortly after this article was posted, a reader informed us that Reid had replied to a follower on Twitter that she may have gotten the statistic wrong. We have now included that in the article.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03188"}
