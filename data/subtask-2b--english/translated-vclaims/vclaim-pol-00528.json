Brian Kolvaji, president and founder of the Wall Building Company, called New Mexico in a series of tweets this month. \"Did you know the state of New Mexico gives all the illegal emergency care, not an operation like the Americans going through. He delivered a 100-dollar EBT, plus $200 for the kid paid every month until their court date after 5-6 years. @GovMLG has a crisis and it costs Americans.\" Kolvaji wrote on Twitter on 9 June. \"\"ALERT TM New Mexico and possibly other illegal states EBT cards are issued with 1K per month + $200 per child, for at least five more years until they see the judge. The illegals ask the customers 'when to get my money. Source: Border Agents. He tweeted June 10. On June 11, he tweeted a video of people rushing from one side of the fence; he described it as a \"continent invasion\" and said about 1,000 people who crossed that site, \"All access to free emergency care from New Mexico!\" Does New Mexico grant migrants in the country illegal electronic transfer cards carrying $1,000 per month for at least five years? Not so, according to Judy McGinnes Porter, speaking on behalf of the New Mexico Human Services Department. \"No one of these tweets is accurate,\" said Porter. \"It is simply unreasonable for Mr. Kolvaji to spread blatant lies. New Mexico is fully compliant with federal regulations and only issues interest to eligible beneficiaries.\" Kolvaji states that the information comes from border patrol personnel Kolvaji told Poletti Fakt that his claim was based on what border patrol personnel said to him on the ground. Kolvaji said: \"The clients have said that it's called emergency social care and that it goes beyond all the rules.\" Migrants received benefits for five to six years \"because this was the backlog of immigration cases in court cases,\" but if they saw the immigration judge in one month, they would receive benefits only for one month. Kolvaji said that the clients he spoke to were not willing to speak to Polyte Fact because they were not authorized to do so by customs and border protection. The Agency &apos; s press office refused to comment. On 9 June, Kolvaj also tweeted in connection with a publication in April of Brettbart, composed of the former Foreign Minister of Kansas Chris Kobach. \"United States law allows those who already receive asylum to qualify for federal social welfare benefits, but it now appears that many asylum-seekers may also receive them,\" said the Kobach article. He also wrote that \"it appears\" that many of the migrants released in the country receive EBT cards before their qualifying period. His article does not specifically mention New Mexico and does not relate to the data in support of his claim. The Supplementary Food Assistance Programme is a federally funded programme to help eligible low-income families buy food. Interest is provided through EBT cards that can be used in grocery stores. The programme is overseen by the United States Department of Agriculture at the federal level and administered by the states in accordance with the federal eligibility guidelines. On February 1, 2021, Tom Cotton mentioned in an interview with Fox and friends \"Many of these arriving immigrants, we have no way of checking their background for either health or security.\" \u2022 3 February 2021 (\"SNAP exit\" is an emergency programme for very low-income families and migrant or seasonal agricultural workers; eligible applicants are allowed to obtain EBT within seven days). We asked the U.S. Department of Agriculture whether it is true that in New Mexico and other states, \"unlegal social welfare cards are issued in emergency situations\" at $1,000 a month plus $200 per child, for at least five years, until they see the judge, as Kolvaji has been tweeted. \"The United States of America has no EBT program like you described,\" said Mike Elenberg, the spokesman for the Federal Agency. In general, immigrants in the country are not legally eligible for EBT card and therefore cannot obtain it, and many immigration law experts have informed PolityFact. Regardless of United States citizens, \"qualified\" migrants may be eligible to benefit from the South Pacific National Action Programme; some of them must meet additional criteria. \"Eligible\" migrants include persons who are legally allowed to enter the country as refugees, persons granted asylum by the immigration judge, and persons who are conditionally released in the United States for at least one year. (The Ministry of Foreign Affairs states that parole is \"an unusual procedure\" that is used in a few ways.) The Kolvaji formulation that EBT cards are issued to immigrants indicates that they see a judge as including asylum-seekers whose cases are decided by immigration judges. However, the only procedure for applying for asylum does not make a person eligible for the South Pacific National Action Programme. They are entitled to asylum once they have been granted asylum. Some states provide state-funded food assistance to qualified migrants who are not eligible to benefit from the South Pacific National Action Programme. However, Kolvagi is tweeting about EBT cards that are part of a federal program. Our judgment, Kolvaj, said that in New Mexico, \"unlegal social welfare cards are issued in case of emergency at $1 a month + $200 per child, for at least five years until they see the judge.\" Federal food assistance benefits are distributed to eligible participants through EBT cards. According to the New Mexico Department of Human Services, which runs the Federal SNAP program, Kolvaji's claim is inaccurate. The U.S. Department of Agriculture said it didn't have a program like the one that Kolvaji mentioned. Persons granted asylum are eligible for the social security programme, but immigration protection alone is not granted eligibility for the food programme.
