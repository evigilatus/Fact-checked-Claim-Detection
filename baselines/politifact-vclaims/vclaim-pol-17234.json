That didn\u2019t happen.\nBut now President Donald Trump is raising the matter again amid a flurry of other baseless voter fraud claims.\nTrump took aim at the Wisconsin system \u2014 built by Republicans \u2014 in a Dec. 2, 2020, speech, including this callback to the contested cleanup of the Wisconsin voter rolls:\n\"In Wisconsin, the state\u2019s Board of Elections could not confirm the residency of more than 100,000 people, but repeatedly refused to remove those names from its voter rolls before the election,\" Trump said. \"They knew why, nobody else did. I knew why. They were illegal voters.\"\nTrump raises a new issue here, going so far as calling the people on this list illegal voters.\nSo let\u2019s look back at what we know.\nAnd why that description is wrong.\nThe background\nThis controversy dates to October 2019, when the Wisconsin Elections Commission sent mailers to 232,000 people saying it believed they may have moved, asking them to update their voter registration or confirm if they lived at the same address. The commission planned to remove people from the roll in 2021 if the resident took no action.\nBut three voters \u2014 represented by Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty \u2014 filed a lawsuit in November 2019 arguing the state had to remove the names from the rolls faster. Ozaukee County Judge Paul Malloy agreed and ordered the names be stricken from the voter rolls.\u00a0\nAn appeals court later ruled against Malloy, keeping names on the rolls, and an appeal of that is pending before the state Supreme Court.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Steineke\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembly Republicans \u201chave come to the table\u201d and were part of \u201cgive and take\u201d compromise on a coronavirus bill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRELATED:\u00a0Are dead people among the names in Wisconsin voter roll purge?\nIn the meantime, the list shrunk \u2014 both from people updating their addresses and from thousands confirming they were wrongly listed as having moved. As of May, about 4,700 voters who were flagged as moving reported they were actually still at their same address.\u00a0\nThe list of potential movers was down to 129,000 as of early 2020.\nNot \"illegal voters\"\nThat brings us to the core of Trump\u2019s claim: That those remaining on the list at the time of the Nov. 3 election were \"illegal voters.\"\nThis is simply wrong.\nNo officials ever asserted these people were unqualified to vote. Even if they had been removed from the list, these voters could have cast a ballot in November by simply re-registering at the polls or anytime before.\nAnd we know from voting records that most people in this group were regulars at the polls. Records show 72% of the original 232,000 on the movers list had voted in the 2016 presidential election, and 89% had voted in at least one election since 2006.\nWe have seen no evidence that people included on the list voted improperly in the Nov. 3 election.\nAmong those left on the list prior to the election, those who moved would have been able to register and vote at their new address. And those who hadn\u2019t moved would have been able to vote at their usual polling place, since they remained registered there.\nOur ruling\nTrump said in a speech that residents the Election Commission suspected of moving are \"illegal voters.\"\nBut there\u2019s absolutely no factual or logical basis to this claim.\nMost people on this list have been regular voters, and nothing about being on the list makes them ineligible to vote.\u00a0 It was just an effort to clarify where voters lived.\nWe rate this False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17234"}
