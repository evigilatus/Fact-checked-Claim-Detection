On August 10, Trump spoke to thousands of supporters in the Broward district arena, pledging to \"batter Hell outside ISIS\" before pointing fingers at Democrats. He said: \"Dash honored President Obama.\" \"He's the founder of ISIS. He's the founder of ISIS, okay? He's the founder. He founded ISIS. I would like to say that the founder will be crooked by Hillary Clinton.\" Trump made similar comments for several months and repeated his last point of dialogue in an interview with Republican Radio Host Hugh Hewitt the day after Broward's speech. In fact, when Hewitt proposed a more cautious explanation for his assertion - Obama and Clinton \"created the vacuum\" in the region and thus \"lost the peace\" to ISIL - Trump rejected that wording, sticking to the more literal version of \"founder\" and \"co-founder.\" \"No, I meant he's the founder of ISIS,\" said Trump Hewitt. \"I do. He was the most valuable player. I'm giving him the most valuable player prize. I'm also giving it, by the way, Hillary Clinton.\" Hewitt replied, \"But he's not sympathetic to them. He hates them. He's trying to kill them.\" Trump again refused to say: \"I don't care. He was the founder. The way he got out of Iraq was, that was the foundation of ISIS, okay? After hours of broadcasting the Hoyt interview, Trump tripled the attack in a speech to the National Assembly of Housebuilders at Miami Beach, accusing them of being the founder and founder of ISIS. Trump was incorrect when Clinton said \"invent\" ISIS with its \"stupid politics,\" as he did a few weeks ago. He is now taking another step in the \"jointly founded\" attack. Let us be clear: It is highly inaccurate to say Obama or Clinton \"co-founder\" ISIS. The establishment of ISIL experts has repeatedly informed us that ISIL sources are complex and interrelated. But Trump's provocative comment obscures all these details. At the outset, the terrorist group had its roots ahead of Obama's presidency and Clinton's role as Secretary of State. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant has used several names since 2004, when Sunni extremists long ago founded Al-Qaida in Iraq, also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and, more recently, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, according to the National Centre for Combating Terrorism. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" By Samantha Butterman - January 11, 2012, after being killed in an American air raid in 2006, the group became the Islamic State of Iraq. In 2013, the group was referred to as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, and later as the Islamic State in 2014. Abubakar al-Baghdadi was the most prominent leader of the group we now call the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, which became the leader in 2010. Democrats often blame President George W. Bush for the establishment of ISIS, because Al-Qaida flourished after Saddam Hussein was overthrown. But you can also argue that Obama &apos; s decision to leave Iraq after 2011 contributed to the security vacuum that gave ISIS the opportunity to root out and regroup. The Trump campaign sent us links to articles on how the Obama administration dealt with the situation in the Middle East, which affected the rise of ISIS. As for Clinton, the Trump campaign had previously indicated that it had voted as a senator to authorize the use of force in Iraq in 2002. She later regretted that vote. While Clinton bears some responsibility for the Iraq war, which gave the Islamic State an opening, it is not solely responsible: the vast majority of senators - from both sides - joined it in supporting the intervention called for by Bush. \"So yes, Hillary's vote for President Bush's misguided policy of building democracy in Iraq directly helped the Republican decision that opened the door to radicalizing Iraq and destabilizing the Levant,\" said Joshua Landis, director of the Centre for Middle East Studies at Oklahoma University, in July when Trump Clinton attacked. \"The destruction of Bush by the Iraqi army and the Iraqi State is the only most important decision that led to the expansion of Al-Qaida in the region and the subsequent emergence of ISIS.\" The Republicans blamed Obama for not keeping 10,000 soldiers in Iraq, which they say could have prevented Fatah ISIL. However, Obama inherited a timetable for leaving Iraq from Bush, and this did not include an agreement to leave much power behind. The Trump campaign also referred to Clinton &apos; s positions on Syria and Libya as evidence that ISIS was allowed to grow. As Foreign Minister in 2011, she reiterated Obama's support for regime change in Syria and said that Assad needed \"to get out of the way.\" \"The enthusiasm of Clinton for regime change in Libya in 2011, supported by Obama, led to the collapse of the regime there, which was exploited by ISIS and others, Christopher Bribel, defense expert at the Liberal Cato Institute, who had already told Politi Fakt. \"This is a fair criticism, in my opinion.\" In recent years, the United States has targeted ISIS militarily, with some signs of progress and some setbacks. After a terrorist attack by ISIL in Brussels, Obama said that the destruction of the group was a \"high priority.\" (It is worth it that Clinton itself supported the support of the Syrian rebels but Obama revoked it.) It also called for a moderate presence of troops in Iraq beyond 2011). As Hewitt suggested in the interview, it can be said that the withdrawal of the administration from Iraq, its lack of support for the anti-Assad rebels in Syria and its decision to intervene in Libya contributed to the ISIL force. These concerns follow what we have heard from foreign policy experts. But this more limited criticism of Clinton's record is what Hoyt showed Trump on his radio show, and the candidate strongly rejected him twice. The Governor Trump said Obama founded ISIS. I'd say the Founder's gonna be crooked with Hillary Clinton. There is credible criticism that Obama &apos; s and Clinton &apos; s foreign and military policy decisions have helped create a space in which ISIL can operate and expand. But Trump expressly rejected this wording, saying that it literally means Obama is the \"founder of ISIS\" and Clinton is the \"founder.\" In fact, ISIS's founder was a terrorist. It is run by terrorists. Obama said that the destruction of ISIS was his top priority. And all of this makes Trump's statement a ridiculous description. He tripled it and quadrupled it in different places, and confirmed that it was meant to take his words literally. We evaluate it with pants on fire.
