Jackson Jr. International Terminal is one of the largest in the country, and it takes advantage of expected growth in international travel at the world\u2019s busiest airport. Passengers will receive the best in service inside its glistening corridors, they say.\n\nWhen city leaders announced its opening date, they could not contain their enthusiasm.\n\n\"I am . . . pleased to announce today that the Maynard H. Jackson International Terminal will open for global business and travel on Wednesday, May 16, on time and on budget,\" Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed said during a speech in the weeks before the terminal\u2019s opening.\n\nThe audience applauded. PolitiFact Georgia grew concerned.\n\n\"On time and on budget\"?\n\nPolitiFact Georgia recently gave airport spokesman John Kennedy a Pants on Fire rating after he said the terminal was completed \"within budget.\"\n\nSo what about the mayor\u2019s \"on time and on budget\" claim?\n\nWe found that airport boosters have made a habit of describing what was a daytime drama as a fairy tale.\n\nAs we\u2019ve said before, planning for the international terminal began more than a decade ago, well before Reed took office as mayor in January 2010. Leaders hoped to double the size of the international complex.\n\nStories printed in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in November 2000 pegged the cost at $719 million.\n\nLeaders said it could be finished as early as 2004, according to AJC stories.\n\nThose plans soon went awry. Construction prices rose, and after the Sept. 11 terror attacks, so did the price of security measures.\n\nDelta Air Lines went into bankruptcy, and the terminal\u2019s original design team was fired because the then-general manager of the airport said its plans would bust the proposed $700 million budget.\n\nBy May 2006, auditors concluded that at an estimated cost of $1 billion, the international terminal\u2019s price tag was spiraling out of control. A year later, the expected price was as high as $1.5 billion, even though it would be 400,000 square feet smaller than planned.\n\nNow on to Reed\u2019s \"on time and on budget\" claim.\n\nReed spokeswoman Sonji Jacobs argued that the mayor\u2019s statement is accurate because the terminal met goals established during his time in office.\n\n\"Mayor Reed\u2019s statement is true and accurate in that it reflects the city\u2019s management of the \u00a0international terminal since his inauguration on Jan. 4, 2010,\" Jacobs said. \u00a0\n\nOne month after he took office, the airlines set a budget of about $1.413 billion, an amount Jacobs said was the only true budget for the terminal. \u00a0\n\nIf Reed specified that the terminal met a budget goal set while he was mayor, Jacobs would have a point. But that\u2019s not what he said.\n\nFurthermore, when top leaders say in public that they expect an airport terminal to cost $700 million, taxpayers expect it to cost $700 million -- regardless of the technicalities.\n\nNow let\u2019s consider whether the terminal opened on time. The following account of airport delays comes from years of stories published in the AJC:\n\nThe Atlanta City Council voted to name the terminal after former Atlanta Mayor Maynard H. Jackson in 2003, soon after his death. That year, it was expected to open in 2006.\n\nIn May 2005, airport officials said that costs were rising for the new terminal, and its opening would be delayed until 2009.\n\nAfter the design team was fired, the terminal opening was delayed until 2010.\n\nBut by 2009, planners projected an early 2012 opening. This date was just about right. The airport opened May 16.\n\nReed\u2019s claim that the terminal opened on time was correct because it began operating as the mayor promised, Jacobs said.\n\n\"Mayor Reed and his administration never veered from saying that under our leadership, the international terminal would open in spring 2012. We did so,\" Jacobs said.\n\nIt\u2019s true that the delays did not take place under Reed\u2019s watch, but no matter how you slice it, the terminal opened years later than originally planned. If officials say it will open in 2006, taxpayers expect it to open in 2006.\n\nReed doesn\u2019t deserve blame for the delays, or the cost overruns.\n\nBut the mayor is accountable for the highly inaccurate claim that the terminal was finished \"on time and on budget.\"\n\nReed earns our lowest rating on this one, Pants on Fire.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVernon Jones\n\n\nstated on June 3, 2010 in a candidate forum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Four years as a congressman, he [U.S. Rep.
