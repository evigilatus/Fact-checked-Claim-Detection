Some are accurate, some are not.\n\"15 days left to vote BUT if you are voting by mail, you need to vote TODAY,\" reads one popular Instagram post. \"USPS says it needs a 14 day roundtrip to be counted on election day.\" reads.\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\u00a0\nThe post is a screenshot of an Oct. 19 tweet by singer-songwriter Finneas Baird O'Connell, brother of singer Billie Eilish. Finneas\u2019 Twitter profile photo is of the Biden/Harris campaign logo, but he has no official role with the campaign.\nThe post wrongly creates the impression that there is a national deadline to vote by mail. It\u2019s also a confusing message: the first sentence says voters must send it mail ballots 15 days ahead of time while the second sentence says the post office needs a 14-day roundtrip, suggesting that a voter can mail it in seven days ahead of time.\nHere\u2019s what you should know:\nThe Postal Service did recommend in a national postcard in September that voters request the mail-in ballot at least 15 days before Election Day, Nov. 3, and return it at least seven days before Election Day. But this Instagram post omits the fact that states set their own laws about deadlines for receiving mail ballots. What\u2019s more, many states have options for voters to bypass the mail to return their ballots in an official ballot drop box or drop off site.\nSince the deadlines to return mail ballots vary by state, the best advice for voters is to check in with their local elections officials for information about when they must return their ballot, and their options for how to return it.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.

USPS says it needs a 14 day roundtrip to be counted on election day.\"\nThe post is unclear and omits important context. USPS said in a postcard in September that voters who want to have their ballots counted in the Nov. 3 general election should request the mail-in ballot at least 15 days before Election Day and return it at least seven days before Election Day. But states set deadlines for receiving mail ballots, and many jurisdictions allow voters to bypass the mail and return ballots in official ballot drop boxes or drop off sites.\nIt\u2019s a good idea to return a ballot as soon as you can, but if you want to know the actual deadline for your state, check in with your state or local elections office. If you want to find out if your city or county has a place where you can drop it off, check in with your local elections office which typically posts that information on their website.\nWe rate this statement Half True.\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections FactChat #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click\u00a0here, for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18733"}
