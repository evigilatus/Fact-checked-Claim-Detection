It's close.", "text": "Add to the list of Elizabeth Warren &apos; s plans to improve rural broadband. In an article in the Washington Post, Warren wrote that more than 21 million Americans lack access to high-speed broadband. It blamed leading Internet service providers, such as Verizon, Comcast, AAT&T and the Charter, for their profit at the expense of rural communities and others. \"We lag behind many other developed countries in communication and speed, while also paying more for that service,\" Warren. We decided to see where the United States stood compared to its peers. But Warren's comments are broad enough for experts to say they're generally accurate. The United States is already lagging behind other States by taking some measures, but rarely among the worst performers, and has gained progress in recent years when it comes to its high-speed introductions. Warren cited the latest figures from the Federal Communications Commission. The Agency is looking at the speed, price and scope of broadband in 26 countries, in addition to the United States. The list includes Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Some things that can be observed in international comparisons: the United States is less densely populated than Europe, increasing costs here. The fixed broadband and mobile broadband are measured separately, and the grades can vary. The figure of 21 million Warren mentioned in her claim refers to those who have no fixed connection to the ground. The Director of the Advanced Institute of Communication Law and Policy at the New York School of Law, Santorelli, urged caution when comparing States on the subject. \"The broadband market in each country is very unique, having been shaped by factors such as the regulatory system, population density, income and consumer demand, among many others.\" With that in mind, here are some of the findings of the Fair Competition Commission based on 2016 figures. For the fixed broadband, the United States ranked 10th on the download speed. Luxembourg &apos; s small country was far ahead with an average download speed of 358 MB per second. After Luxembourg, the speed drops rapidly. No. Iceland has deployed 96 MB speed. The United States was in a narrow group within 55 megabytes, with Spain and Denmark a little faster, Norway and Portugal a little slower. Classifications are always a little suspicious, because sometimes small differences in speed put a country above another. The professor of law at the University of Pennsylvania, Christopher Yoo, specializing in communications and information technology matters, noted that the United States had made progress over the years. In 2012, the United States ranked twenty-fifth in relation to the fixed broadband. \"Looks like we're in the top half and we're getting better,\" said U. On January 17, 2021, President Donald Trump stated in an interview with Fox News that \"he can't say anything (about the riots in the American Capitol Building) because the platforms removed it.\" By Bill McCarthy on January 18, 2021, on a scale similar to that of the mobile broadband, the US ranked 24th. At a speed of about 41 MB, the Netherlands was the winner. The United States experienced about 19 MB under Portugal, Italy and the Czech Republic. The Fair Competition Commission has three ways of arriving at comparable prices among all countries. It uses average prices, two other approaches that are instrumental in service value as well as variables such as population size and density. The results of different methods vary considerably: when it comes to average price, the United States ranks 18th. However, when measured using the most accurate methods of the Committee, it is ranked seventh in fixed and tenth in mobile communication. The professor of telecommunications in Pennsylvania, Rob Frieden, generally agrees with Warren's summary, but says that the big picture can hide that some American agents do better than their foreign counterparts. \"For so-called frequency-band pigs that flow a lot and a lot of video, the United States offers some of the lowest cost per MMP transmission speed and MMP delivery data,\" Frieden said. A British company called Cable, as appropriate, also collects information on broadband prices worldwide. In its 2011 survey, based on the average monthly cost, the United States ranked 23th among the list of countries that are similar to, but not identical to, the FTC list. This is the area in which the report of the Fair Competition Commission gives more mixed signals. In general, the United States ranks tenth in the percentage of the population reached by its fixed broadband networks. For rural areas, the country ranks ninth. However, the Fair Competition Commission does not have a breakdown by country of the mobile broadband. Instead, the study compares the United States with a group of 21 European countries. In the light of this, the United States generally has better performance, but especially in rural areas: 98 per cent of rural households in the United States have high-speed services. For the 21 States of the European Union, this fraction is reduced to 83 per cent. However, using this image of the Financial Coordination Committee as evidence, we do not have a clear picture of how the United States population using broadband is accumulating against countries that are not mentioned in this section of the report. Our Governor, Warren, said that the United States was lagging behind many other developed countries in communication and speed, while also paying more for that service. Her words are broad enough to fit in with the government report I mentioned, but the figures show that the United States is generally in the middle of the group for speed, price and access. While, in many cases, the most performing States may emerge, minor differences in values determine their place in the order. Warren's statement is generally accurate, but it needs context. We're mostly assessing this claim right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00220"}
