The retired Colonel Ralph Peters, who repeatedly appeared on Fox News as the \"strategic analyst\" of the network, said that it was done through design. But not for what you might think. \"You think today's time for these strikes is important. Why? Bill Hammer of Fox News Peters asked about the American News Room on September 24th. \"Well, it's really, really important,\" said Peters. \"I believe that the media were so surprised by dramatic footage of the launch of cruise missiles and their previous and subsequent images that they missed the basic point: Obama had restrictions on this air operation not only to reduce civilians (victims), but to minimize terrorist casualties. \"He didn't want to spill blood, so he attacked us in the middle of the night. Now the only reason you attack in the middle of the night is if there's a restricted air defence complex and you're worried about it -- there were no air defences in the areas we attacked. The Syrians certainly wouldn't have done anything to them. ISIL doesn't have them. You could have gone there safely in a suspended plane. But instead we went in the middle of the night. Why? Because the buildings were empty.\" Did America really target terrorist strongholds only at night as a way to avoid killing terrorists? We found that there were a lot of possible explanations for Lily's attack. Peters stood up, in an interview with Bondet Fuckett, along with his comments. \"In the past we attacked at night to limit the ability of enemy air defence systems to target our aircraft,\" he said. \"In this case, there was no threat of air defence in the areas controlled by the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL). The spokesman for the United States Central Command was reluctant to discuss operations in Syria, referring to the goal of destroying terrorist infrastructure - access to oil refineries, financial centres, radio dishes, transport corridors, training sites, etc. That made Syria a \"safe haven\" for terrorism, as Obama said. The strikes against the Islamic State and Khorsan were along the northern Turkish border and the headquarters of Es Raqqah. CentCom launched videos of the attacks near the Tubokah, a refinery, and the ISIS vehicle storage site. The night attacks are normal procedures, and the desert storm, permanent freedom and Iraqi freedom have all started in a similar way, as the retired Air Force General, General David Deptola, said, is the main planner of the attack in Operation Desert Storm and the commander of the Joint Air Operations Centre for Operation Enduring Freedom. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \"The bottom line is, if you go back and look historically, we usually strike first at night because there is a sudden factor, and people don't expect it,\" said Debutula, Dean of the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies, a Washington-based research group founded by the Air Force Union. Michael O &apos; Hanlon, Senior Fellow of the Brookings Institution and Co-Director of the Security and Intelligence Centre for the 21st Century, agreed with Deptola &apos; s view that a night attack would hide the visual gift and prevent terrorists from using cell phones to spread the word of the air threat that is on the horizon. \"I think this is a more credible theory than Ralph's in this case,\" said O'Hanlon. While there is little doubt that the Ministry of Defence is trying to minimize civilian casualties, \"I do not agree with the point of desire to minimize terrorist casualties,\" said retired Air Force Colonel Mark G\u00fcnsinger, who works at the Centre for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments. \"In fact, I find this kind of a weird comment.\" Another reason for the night attack, the experts told us, is that U.S. aircraft have the greatest advantage when they fly at night, and they're going to fly at night. Peters often correctly described the air defence capabilities of Syria and the Islamic State, as the experts said. In view of Syria &apos; s mutual problem with the Islamic State, it is unlikely that the Syrian Integrated Air Defence System will threaten United States warplanes on their way to the ISIL targets, as said by Christopher Harmer, an institute for the study of war, a senior maritime analyst with the Middle East security project. The ISIS air defence was essential and included some large-calibre anti-aircraft guns. \"These primitive air defence systems are completely ineffective at night,\" said Harmor. \"Though it is not a major threat, night flight also reduces the risk.\" Our rule, Peters, said that the United States had launched air strikes against terrorist targets at night to reduce the number of victims of terrorism. The only reason for the night attack was to hit empty buildings. One of the principles of Bondet Vac is that persons making factual claims are responsible for their words and should be able to provide evidence to support them. In this case, Peter's evidence seems to depend on his knowledge of previous air attacks. However, several experts provided details of other reasons why the United States should strike at night. The ultimate motives are unknown, but the lack of information casts great shadows on Peter's claim. We're mostly assessing his statement wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07247"}
