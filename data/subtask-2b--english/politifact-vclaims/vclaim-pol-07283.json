Even the Old Dominion University researchers whose work was cited as support for the connection said it was wrong.\nBut by then it was too late to correct the record.\nThe claim has found new life amid cable news coverage of former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice and Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson. Morning Joe host Mika Brzezinski used it to support her argument that there is a connection between violence at home and aggressive play on the football field on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe.\n\"You look at Super Bowl Sunday. Super Bowl Sunday has the highest rate of domestic violence,\" she said Sept. 16. \"There\u2019s something about the game!\"\nMinutes later, she said, \"This is a violent game. And domestic violence on Super Bowl Sunday. We've seen the numbers. Why is that?\"\nThe truth is that Super Bowl Sunday is not a unique day for domestic violence, says Callie Rennison, a University of Colorado Denver public affairs professor who studies domestic violence.\n\"This is not to be confused with there being no violence or a lower amount of violence on Super Bowl Sunday,\" Rennison said. \"It happens on holidays, it happens on weekends, and it happens on weekdays.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRennison sent us a 2007 study published in Human Organization, the journal of the Society for Applied Anthropology, which concluded that the belief that domestic violence crisis calls increase during drink holidays in general, including the Super Bowl, is unsubstantiated.\nPress coverage of the original news conference 20 years ago said a California Women\u2019s Law Center official cited research to bolster her comments. The lawyer, Sheila Kuehl, was reported as citing an academic study that found a 40 percent uptick in police reports of beatings and hospital admissions after Washington Redskins victories between 1988-89.\nBut \"that\u2019s not what we found at all,\" Janet Katz, the Old Dominion University criminology professor who worked on the study, told the Washington Post.\nKatz said her \"tentative findings\" did not correlate an increase in ER admissions of women with football games in general or with men upset by a team loss.\nA spokeswoman for MSNBC did not offer comment by deadline.\nOur ruling\nBrzezinski invoked a widely debunked claim that Super Bowl Sunday has the highest rate of domestic violence on Morning Joe.\nIt\u2019s no more true now than 20 years ago. Experts say this myth persists in spite of long-lasting academic rebuke.\nWe rate it Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07283"}
