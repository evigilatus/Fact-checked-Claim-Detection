Intelligence officials feared Page was a potential Russian agent, or the target of Moscow's\u00a0recruiting efforts.\nOn Twitter, Trump\u00a0claimed the surveillance application proves the Steele dossier launched the Russia probe.\n\"So we now find out that it was indeed the unverified and Fake Dirty Dossier, that was paid for by Crooked Hillary Clinton and the DNC, that was knowingly & falsely submitted to FISA and which was responsible for starting the totally conflicted and discredited Mueller Witch Hunt!\" Trump tweeted July 23.\nSo we now find out that it was indeed the unverified and Fake Dirty Dossier, that was paid for by Crooked Hillary Clinton and the DNC, that was knowingly & falsely submitted to FISA and which was responsible for starting the totally conflicted and discredited Mueller Witch Hunt!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 23, 2018 \nPut simply, Trump is wrong about the triggering event. The Steele dossier did not launch the FBI\u2019s investigation into links between the Trump campaign and Russia.\nThe dossier was used, to some extent, to persuade a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court to authorize surveillance of Page. But it was the actions of another Trump campaign adviser \u2014 George Papadopoulos \u2014 that actually started the investigation.\nTrump adviser George Papadopoulos triggered investigation\nThe federal government started looking into Russian election involvement in July 2016 based on information from Papadopoulos. This was confirmed by Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee.\n\"The Papadopoulos information triggered the opening of an FBI counterintelligence investigation in late July 2016 by FBI agent Pete Strzok,\" the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s GOP members wrote in a Feb. 2 memo.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Republicans confirmed in an April report it was Papadopoulos who set the FBI investigation in motion.\nSo, what was the \"Papadopoulos information\"?\nAccording to the New York Times, Papadopoulos told a high-ranking Australian diplomat at an upscale London bar in May 2016 that Moscow had \"political dirt\" on Hillary Clinton. Australian officials relayed this information to their American counterparts.\nMueller appointed later\nTrump also confused the timeline of Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s involvement.\nThe Papadopoulos discussion of Clinton dirt that triggered the investigation took place in May 2016. Yet an entire year would pass before Mueller entered the picture.\nThe Justice Department did not appoint Mueller to take over the FBI investigation until May 2017, roughly a week after Trump fired FBI director James Comey.\nOur ruling\nTrump said the Steele dossier \"was responsible for starting\" Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into links between the Trump campaign and Russia.\nThe Steele dossier did not trigger Mueller\u2019s investigation. It was information from Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos that set the probe in motion. Also, Mueller did not take up the investigation until roughly a year after the triggering event.\nWe rate this False.\n Share the Facts 2018-07-23 15:44:27 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  Says the newly released documents underlying the FBI\u2019s surveillance of former campaign adviser Carter Page show the Steele dossier \"was responsible for starting\" Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into links between the Trump campaign and Russia.
