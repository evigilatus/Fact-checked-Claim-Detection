Steny Hoyer claims there were more job losses in Bush's last three months than last three under Obama", "text": "In a spirited exchange on the House floor the other day, Republican Rep. Mike Pence used a popular GOP talking point about the economic stimulus package. \u201cWhere are the jobs?\u201d he asked.   Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 Democrat in the House, responded by saying job losses were worse under President George W. Bush.   \u201cWe have lost 200,000 less jobs per month than Bush lost in his last three months in office, over the last three months.\u201d His syntax was a bit spotty, but the point was clear \u2014 that the scale of job losses was greater during the end of the Bush administration than it has been over the past few months under President Barack Obama.\nWe turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the government agency that keeps employment data, to sort this out. When we asked how the bureau would go about checking Hoyer's math, Gary Steinberg, a BLS press officer, told us to look at the monthly changes in seasonally adjusted, nonfarm payrolls.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

Between October and November, 597,000 jobs were lost; between November and December, 681,000 were lost; and between December and January, 741,000 were lost.\nFor the most recent three months under Obama: 519,000 jobs were lost between March and April, 322,000 from April to May, and 467,000 May to June.   There are two ways to look at these numbers. While Hoyer\u2019s language leaves some room for interpretation about what he meant, the most reasonable measurement may be to average the three months for each president and then compare the result. Calculated this way, the average job losses under Bush\u2019s three months were 673,000, versus 436,000 for Obama. Subtract Obama\u2019s number from Bush\u2019s and you find that Obama had, on average, 237,000 fewer monthly job losses \u2014 meaning that Hoyer was correct. In fact, he understated the difference.   Another way to look at it would be to see if any single month-to-month comparison netted a difference smaller than 200,000. Looking at all nine possible month-to-month comparisons, it turns out that six of the nine comparisons, or two-thirds, match or exceed Hoyer\u2019s benchmark difference of 200,000. So by this measure, Hoyer isn\u2019t perfect, but he\u2019s right more often than he\u2019s not.   We used the above methodology to calculate the numbers after we spoke with two economists \u2014 Gary Burtless, an economist with the moderate-to-liberal Brookings Institution and a former economist with the Labor Department, and Anna Turner, a research assistant with the liberal Economic Policy Institute. They agreed with the BLS spokesman about using the change in nonfarm payrolls.   But there is another way to slice and dice BLS\u2019 statistics. When we asked the Employment Policies Institute, a think tank funded by businesses, how it would sift the numbers, a spokeswoman suggested looking at month-to-month changes in unemployment, rather than employment. The employment figures come from a payroll survey of 400,000 work sites, whereas unemployment figures come from a survey of 60,000 households.   Lo and behold, using this measurement dramatically changes the outcome.  \u00a0  The monthly increases in unemployment during Bush\u2019s final three months were 255,000 from October to November, 632,000 from November to December, and 508,000 from December to January. Averaged out, that\u2019s an increase of 465,000 unemployed Americans per month under Bush.   By contrast, under Obama, the nation lost 563,000 jobs between March and April, 787,000 between April and May and 218,000 between May and June. On average, the changes in unemployment were 523,000 per month under Obama \u2014 a number that\u2019s actually higher than what it was under Bush. So using these figures, Hoyer would be wrong.   We asked a cross-section of economists whether one measure was inherently better than the other. On this question, the conservatives and liberals we spoke to agreed: Charting employment by using the payroll survey, as Hoyer appears to have done, is indeed the economist's preferred way of doing it.   \u201cUsing payroll employment is the way to go \u2014 looking at unemployment levels is messy because the labor force is always changing,\u201d said Heidi Shierholz, an economist with the liberal Economic Policy Institute. \u201cA general rule of thumb: Look at payroll employment changes, or unemployment rate changes.\u201d   J.D. Foster of the conservative Heritage Foundation agreed. \u201cIf you\u2019re not employed, you get into various issues of why you\u2019re not employed,\u201d he said. \u201cDid you retire? Are you leaving because you\u2019re discouraged about finding a job?\u201d By contrast, he said, \u201cif you\u2019re employed, you\u2019re employed.\u201d  \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0  So Hoyer\u2019s figures mostly hold up under scrutiny. He's right if you calculate an average, but he's only right six of nine times when you look at the monthly changes. So we rate his statement Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-15674"}
