The two, along with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show to announce a $100 million donation from Zuckerberg to be put toward public education in the city.\nFast forward three years. Booker\u2019s in the middle of a U.S. Senate race and a super PAC called American Commitment made a website called BookerFail to highlight criticism of him.\n\"Three years after getting the $100 million, less than two-thirds of students in Cory Booker's Newark graduate,\" said a BookerFail video criticizing Booker for his inability to improve Newark public schools.\nWe\u2019ll look at how Newark schools have done since Zuckerberg\u2019s donation, but first we\u2019ll explain how his donation was made and to whom.\nGrant specifics\nZuckerberg donated $100 million nearly three years ago to start a foundation for education called the Foundation for Newark\u2019s Future. The money is a matching grant, so the foundation only spends as many dollars as other donors also contribute. The money must be used by 2015, said Kim McLain, the foundation\u2019s president and CEO.\nThe foundation divides grant funds into six categories, with \"teacher quality and principal leadership\" getting by far the largest chunk of money so far. That money goes toward funding merit pay, a controversial system of paying higher salaries to teachers whose students earn high test scores.\nMore than $75 million has been allotted to the different causes in total,\u00a0the foundation reported. McClain declined to say how much money has been matched so far, so it's unclear how much of Zuckerberg's donation has been spent.\nHow big is this contribution, really? It amounts to little more than pocket change for a school district of Newark\u2019s size, as it turns out. For perspective, consider that Newark\u2019s entire yearly education budget is roughly $1 billion, so that\u2019s $5 billion over the period of time when Zuckerberg\u2019s money can be spent.\n\"It\u2019s not a game-changer,\" said Paul Tractenberg, founder of the Institute on Education Law and Policy at Rutgers University-Newark. \"If you use the money tactically, it\u2019s enough money to do some interesting things.\"\nIt\u2019s also key that this money and the matching funds went directly to the foundation, not the city of Newark.\nWhen it comes to Newark schools, Booker doesn\u2019t have any legal say in his role as mayor, and neither does any other city government official under his watch. The state has controlled the district\u2019s schools for almost 20 years. The state appellate court ruled in July that the district isn\u2019t yet ready for autonomy, based on its test scores and graduation rates.\n\"Whatever role he has, it\u2019s a secondary, indirect role,\" Tractenberg said. \"My impression is Cory Booker has backed off a lot from his early more direct engagements in education reform.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mayor does sit on the foundation\u2019s board of directors, his most direct involvement with the Zuckerberg funds. The mayor\u2019s primary role has been helping find funders to match Zuckerberg\u2019s donation.\nBecause Booker legally must let the state make education decisions in his city, it\u2019s not as if any successes or failures the district has can be traced back to him or his staff. Just because Booker is on the board doesn\u2019t mean he has full authority in spending the funds.\nMaking the grade\nAside from the question of Booker\u2019s control over the district, the other key part of the ad is whether or not \"less than two-thirds of students\" graduate.\nThe graduation rate for 2012 graduates was 68.72 percent, which is just a tad over two-thirds of students. The video, posted earlier this month, references 2011 numbers, according to an email source list sent by Stephen Manfredi, spokesman for American Commitment. In 2011 the graduation rate was 61.26 percent, which is under two-thirds.\nSo the video features a graduation rate that does, by experts\u2019 standards, indeed leave lots of room for improvement. We won\u2019t go back further than 2011 to check the change in graduation rate over time, because that\u2019s when the methodology used to calculate those numbers, was last changed.\nWhat the video doesn\u2019t mention is that the graduation rate has recently improved. Between 2011 and 2012, the graduation rate increased nearly 7 percentage points. That represents the largest growth out of all of New Jersey\u2019s urban districts, Booker for Senate spokeswoman Silvia Alvarez wrote in an email. That\u2019s not for nothing.\nStill, placing too much importance on good or bad graduation numbers isn\u2019t a holistic way of evaluating schools\u2019 performances, said Eden Kyse, director of the Center for Research and Evaluation on Education and Human Services at Montclair State University.\n\"It doesn\u2019t tell the whole story,\" Kyse said. \"It\u2019s an indicator.\"\nAs the Foundation for Newark\u2019s Future spends Zuckerberg\u2019s money, they know improving education isn\u2019t something that\u2019s solved with a few years\u2019 worth of graduation statistics, McLain said.\n\"Newark public schools need to be improved and provide for better educational outcomes for kids,\" McLain said. \"We believe our work and our effort will assist that. It\u2019s not going to happen overnight.\"\nOur ruling\nA super PAC\u2019s ad criticized Mayor Booker for Newark\u2019s low graduation rate three years after Zuckerberg donated $100 million to improving the city\u2019s education. Newark does have a graduation rate right around two-thirds -- it's actually a touch higher than that -- but there\u2019s more to the picture.\nDespite the ad\u2019s implications, the city\u2019s graduation rate is on the rise. The ad\u2019s phrasing also implies that Booker is the official responsible for schools even though he\u2019s not in charge of them. The money is only a small sliver of the school district's overall budget, and it hasn't all been spent yet, so it's not clear if it's had time to make an impact.\nBecause the ad omits necessary context about the grant money and Newark\u2019s improving graduation rate, in addition to implying that Booker is to blame, we rate this claim Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08952"}
