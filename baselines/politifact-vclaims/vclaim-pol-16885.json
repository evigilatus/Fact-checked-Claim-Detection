Not true", "text": "Amid the pandemonium of an off-again, on-again Wisconsin election in the middle of a pandemic, claims have been circulating online that voters can have a ballot emailed to them instead of waiting in line.\nPosts across Facebook and Twitter echoed this claim.\u00a0\nPerhaps most notably, so did a tweet from Ben Wikler, chairman of the state Democratic Party. Here\u2019s what he sent out Monday, April 6, 2020:\n\"If you have requested an absentee ballot and it hasn\u2019t arrived yet \u2014 like thousands of other Wisconsinites \u2014 then you call your clerk and as for a ballot to be emailed to you. You then find a safe way to print it out, fill it in and drop it off. Clerk then copies it to official paper.\"\nThat\u2019s not true. And Wikler has since deleted the tweet.\nHere are the details:\nDeadline for email ballots has passed\nWisconsin Elections Commission spokesman Reid Magney said the deadline for emailed ballots was Friday, April 3, 2020 \u2014 four days before the election.\nUntil that cut-off date, voters could request a mail or email ballot by email, fax or through the commission\u2019s website.\nThe only way for residents to get a ballot after that \u2014 even those who requested an absentee ballot but didn\u2019t receive it \u2014 is by going to their local polling place in person on Election Day, April 7, 2020.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin LeMahieu\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a TV interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It takes quite a while on Election Day to load those ballots, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWikler did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nMagney said the commission was aware of the tweet.\n\"He was wrong,\" Magney said.\nAnd later in the day, so was state Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, who made a nearly identical claim to a reporter while working as an election inspector.\nHis staff later admitted the error. Spokeswoman Kit Beyer confirmed\u00a0Vos was mistaken, saying the elections commission \"had guidance recently on that fact, which staff hadn\u2019t briefed him on.\"\nHere's Wisconsin Speaker @SpeakerVos saying that people who didn't receive ballots they requested can still request e-mailed ballots from their clerk? I... don't think that's true? Maybe I'm wrong, though? pic.twitter.com/jiRxLvwRK0\u2014 Parker Molloy (@ParkerMolloy) April 7, 2020 \nOur ruling\nWikler, like many others on social media, claimed voters could get a ballot sent to them by email right up to Election Day.\nState officials say that is not the case \u2014 the deadline passed the week before. And Wikler has since deleted his tweet.\nWe rate this claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16885"}
