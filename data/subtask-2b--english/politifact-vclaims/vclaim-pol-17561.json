Saudi terrorists has killed more Americans on our soil than any other nation.\n2. They rent the entire 45th floor of Trump Tower, And pay him in cash.\nThose are facts.\"\nThe role of Saudi Arabian terrorists as part of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks is fairly well known (and we\u2019ll recap it below). But we were intrigued by the second part of the claim about the happenings on the 45th floor of Trump Tower. We found that part of the story misleading.\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

(One was Egyptian, one Lebanese and two were from the United Arab Emirates.)\nSaudis bought the 45th floor\nIn June 2001 (more than 15 years before he\u2019d become president, and months before the 9/11 attacks), Trump sold \u2014 not rented \u2014 the entire 45th floor of Trump World Tower in New York City to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, according to multiple reports. The transaction earned Trump $4.5 million, according to the New York Daily News.\u00a0\nSo, that\u2019s a cash payment \u2014 but not, as the post suggests, handing over actual currency every month. And certainly not in the present tense.\nThe apartments, located near the United Nations headquarters, were converted in 2008 into part of the Saudi Mission to the UN.\nOur ruling\nFifteen of the 19 hijackers in the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the worst-ever on American soil, were Saudi.\u00a0\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, not Saudi terrorists, bought the 45th floor of Trump World Tower, in 2001. The country is not paying rent currently.\nThis post contains an element of truth but distorts the facts. We rate it Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17561"}
