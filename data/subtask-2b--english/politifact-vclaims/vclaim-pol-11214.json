Chris Christie unveiled a proposal to cut income taxes by 10 percent, saying property taxes are more of a burden for New Jersey residents.\n\nAssembly Speaker Sheila Oliver (D-Essex) reiterated that point during a recent radio interview.\n\n\"In New Jersey our constituents want to see the Legislature and the governor focus on cutting the property taxes. The average New Jerseyan pays close to $8,000 a year and that is just average,\" Oliver told Steve Adubato Jr. on WOR-AM on April 19.\n\n\"The proposal to cut income taxes by 10 percent, if you took a family with an average income of $50,000 -- which, by the way, $57,000 is the mean in our state -- that would provide $80 over a three-year period in the pockets of a New Jersey family. That is not anything of significance. We say that won't buy a bag of groceries for a working-class family,\" Oliver said.\n\nWe previously checked a statement about potential savings from the governor\u2019s income tax cut proposal. It\u2019s true a couple with a taxable income of $50,000 would pay about $80 less in income taxes under Christie\u2019s plan.\n\nBut is Oliver right that the average family in New Jersey lives on $57,000 a year?\n\nWe should note that economists generally prefer median income to mean income, since the mean income can be skewed by extremes, such as very high-income earners.\n\nRobert Bernstein, a spokesman for the U.S. Census Bureau, said since the mean can be distorted \"it's not a good reflection of the situation there. Median is better.\"\n\nThe median income is the amount in the middle when a series of numbers are ordered smallest to largest.\n\nBy either measure, Oliver is wrong.\n\nThe mean family income in New Jersey was $106,125 in 2010, according to the most recent data available from the American Community Survey, a yearly national assessment conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. The median family income, according to the same survey, was $82,427.\n\nTom Hester Jr., a spokesman for the Assembly Democrats, told us Oliver meant to refer to the annual average wage in New Jersey, not the average family income.\n\nThere\u2019s a significant difference between the two.\n\nThe annual average wage is calculated by determining the total amount of wages paid out in a year and dividing by all the workers covered by the state\u2019s unemployment insurance system who got a paycheck.\n\nThe figure is \"based on workers employed at New Jersey companies, those workers may or may not be New Jersey residents,\" Brian Murray, a spokesman for the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development, said in an e-mail.\n\nAccording to a state labor department report released in 2011, the annual average wage in New Jersey was $56,385 in 2010.\n\nOur ruling\n\nOliver said, \"$57,000 is the mean [income] in our state\" for a family.\n\nThat\u2019s not true. The mean family income in New Jersey in 2010 was $106,125 and the median income, a measure less influenced by very high-income earners, was $82,427.\n\nWe rate Oliver\u2019s statement False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Boysko\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in a committee debate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe United States is the only industrialized, modernized country that does not already have a paid family medical leave program in place.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo comment on this story, go to NJ.com.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11214"}
