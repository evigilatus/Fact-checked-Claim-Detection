(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe viral post does contain a kernel of truth: The industry became more commercially driven during this era. But while health care did go from a mostly nonprofit venture to one that was more lucrative as a result of the law, it\u2019s an overstatement to say profit-making was illegal prior to the Nixon era.\nThe HMO Act of 1973\nThe definition of what an HMO is has morphed a bit over time. But essentially it\u2019s a company that blends insurance functions and health care functions, said Daniel Polsky, a health economics professor at Johns Hopkins University.\n\"The HMO act of 1973 promoted the development of HMOs,\" Polsky said. \"After the act, these types of organizations became easier to form and operate.\"\nThe early prepaid group practice plans \u2014 the prototypes for HMOs \u2014 were all nonprofit. But the 1973 legislation unleashed the development of for-profit HMOs, said Paul Starr, a sociology professor at Princeton University.\n\"Many of the early HMOs were subsequently bought by for-profit insurers,\" said Starr, who authored a Pulitzer Prize-winning book about the history of American health care. \"So the industry as a whole has changed quite dramatically.\"\nIt\u2019s worth noting the post also claims that Nixon pushed the federal HMO Act as a kickback to his political backer Edgar Kaiser.\n\"In 1973, Nixon did a personal favor for his friend and campaign financier, Edgar Kaiser, then president and chairman of Kaiser Permanente,\" the post states, adding that the company \"got the first taste of federal subsidies\" as a result of the law.\nOur friends at Snopes noted this element of the claim \u2014 which it calls the post's \"primary emotional hook\" \u2014 is false.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fact-checking outlet cited a Kaiser Permanente fact sheet, which notes that due to legislative tweaks, the bill Nixon signed into law \"had been so diluted by the political process ... that Kaiser Permanente, a central model at the outset, did not qualify as an HMO until the act was amended four years later.\"\nProfiting off health care was legal prior to 1973\nWhile the legislation scrambled the economics of health care, it did not have as dramatic an impact on American law. In short, it was legal to profit off health care before the act \u2014 but there\u2019s an important wrinkle to the legal dimension.\nAllison K. Hoffman, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania who studies health care, told us the law can be seen as \"part of the tide of the corporatization of medicine that is now fully turned.\"\n\"The HMO act did bring the idea of competition into the spotlight in health care,\" Hoffman said. \"But it neither began this trend nor transformed it from illegal to legal, for the most part.\"\nHoffman hedged somewhat on that last point \u2014 no legal transformation \"for the most part\" \u2014 because the Nixon-era act did rejigger the relationship between HMOs and state legislatures.\nSpecifically, the 1973 act made HMOs exempt from state laws that kept medical decisions in the hands of doctors. As a result, the medical practice was subject to more corporate influence.\n\"That could be characterized as making profiteering legal in health care,\" she said. \"But, even with these laws in place, MDs and hospitals had profit motives well before the HMO Act came to be.\"\nHoffman added, \"There was clearly profit in health care \u2014 and profit motive \u2014 before 1973.\"\nSome U.S. health care stakeholders \u2014 from insurers to hospital chains \u2014 have operated for profit since the 1950s and 1960s \u2014 prior to the act\u2019s passage. Others have done so for their entire existence, said Katherine Hempstead, a senior advisor at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.\n\"The drug and device industries have always been for profit,\" she said.\nOur ruling\nInternet bloggers said that \"before 1973 it was illegal in the U.S. to profit off of health care.\"\nThe legislation did make the industry more commercially driven, but it\u2019s wrong to say profit-making in the U.S. health care sector was illegal prior to Nixon\u2019s signing of the HMO Act of 1973. Insurers and hospital chains generated profits decades earlier, and drug companies and medical device makers have always operated for profit.\nWe rate this False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00685"}
