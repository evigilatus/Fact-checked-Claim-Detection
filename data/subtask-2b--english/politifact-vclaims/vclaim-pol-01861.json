Read more about our partnership with Facebook.\nThe story mischaracterizes what the New York Times magazine wrote about Trump in 1984 in an article headlined \"The expanding empire of Donald Trump.\"\nAt the time Trump, was the 37-year-old owner of the New Jersey Generals, a franchise in the upstart United States Football League. He was also the owner of many other businesses and properties.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Times wrote: \"Donald J. Trump is the man of the hour. Turn on the television or open a newspaper almost any day of the week and there he is, snatching some star form the National Football League, announcing some preposterously lavish project he wants to build. Public-relations firms call him, offering to handle his account for nothing, so that they might take credit for the torrential hoopla.\"\nNothing in the article declared that Trump would be the best president. The article did include a line that Trump said he didn\u2019t want to be president:\n\"He is constantly asked about his interest in running for elective office. Absolutely not, he answers,\" the Times wrote. \"All of the false smiles and the red tape. It is too difficult to really do anything. He dislikes meetings and paperwork and is in the enviable position of being able to avoid both.\"\nBling News drew its report from another website, 100percentfedup. That website posted this update and correction following an article by Factcheck.org:\n\"We like to think our readers can think subjectively and \u2018get\u2019 our nuanced titles once they read the article. We give you credit for understanding where we\u2019re coming from. Factcheck.org has claimed that the New York Times didn\u2019t say Trump would be our BEST president. To clarify, if you read the intro paragraph of the article we hope you\u2019ll think subjectively and understand what we said about the article. We believe that the New York Times INADVERTENTLY DESCRIBED HOW TRUMP WOULD BE A PERFECT FIT FOR THIS TIME IN AMERICA, therefore, THE BEST PRESIDENT \u2018FOR THIS TIME IN AMERICA.\u2019\"\nWe found no contact information on Bling News\u2019 website. The New York Times magazine story in 1984 didn\u2019t say that Trump would be our best president; instead, it was an in-depth profile of Trump the businessman. We rate this statement Pants on Fire.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/40fb00a7-5c8a-4dbc-918a-b6103424f6af", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01861"}
