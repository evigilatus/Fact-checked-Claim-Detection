(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nThe story with that headline was posted on Big League Politics on Sept. 7.\n\"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is warning parents that their children may be kept from their parents overnight due to COVID-19 concerns, as states set up COVID-19 shelters where infected individuals could be forcibly quarantined,\" the story says.\u00a0\nBut the CDC advisory the website links to as evidence says nothing of the sort.\u00a0\nThe advisory is titled: \"Easy as ABC: Three steps to protect your child during emergencies in the school day.\" It concerns recommendations for how to care for children during disasters such as severe weather events that may cause children to be temporarily separated from families.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 25, 2021 in a blog post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWHO now saying you do not need to wear a mask.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe advisory doesn\u2019t mention COVID-19 or the coronavirus. Rather, it suggests bringing \"extra medicines, special food, or supplies your child would need if you were separated overnight\" and filling out a \"backpack card\" that lists the names and contact information of parents, guardians or caregivers.\u00a0\n\"An emergency might require a sleepover,\" the advisory says. \"Tell school administrators about any extra supplies your child may need to safely make it through a night away from home.\"\nThe Big League Politics story also cites an unrelated Aug. 31 order from the director of Ohio\u2019s health department to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The director ordered the use of shelters for people who need to quarantine or isolate themselves and can\u2019t do so safely in their own homes. The order says nothing about separating students from their parents.\u00a0\nDuring a press conference on Sept. 8, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine called online rumors about the state creating FEMA camps and separating families \"garbage,\" according to the Plain Dealer newspaper.\n\"There\u2019s just absolutely no truth in this,\" he said. \"There\u2019s no substance behind it.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nFEMA money has reimbursed the state for the costs of housing some hospital workers in hotels so they wouldn\u2019t expose vulnerable family members to COVID-19, DeWine said. But claims that families would be forcibly separated because of the coronavirus are \"absolutely ridiculous,\" he said. \"There is no intention to separate children.\"\nWe rate this Instagram post Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18901"}
