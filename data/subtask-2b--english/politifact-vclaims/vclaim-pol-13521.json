More states, including Rhode Island, are weighing changes this year, provoking protests and legal challenges from public employee unions.\n\nState General Treasurer Gina Raimondo, who has been sounding the alarm about Rhode Island\u2019s $5 billion unfunded pension liability, was questioned about the issue Feb. 18 on WRNI\u2019s \"Political Roundtable\" show. One exchange caught our attention:\n \nDo state employees have a \"property right\" to their pensions? she was asked.\n\n\"I don\u2019t believe so,\" Raimondo said. \"That hasn\u2019t been established in law and I don\u2019t believe they do.\"\n\nRaimondo reiterated her position Feb. 25 on Channel 12 \"Newsmakers.\" Asked about property rights for state pensions, she said, \"this is an unsettled area of law. So in Rhode Island, our pension benefits are put out in statute, they\u2019re not put out in a contract, as they are in some states. They\u2019re not put out in the Constitution. It\u2019s put out in statute. So it\u2019s still an unsettled area of law.\"\n\nThe point Raimondo was making is critical. In the radio interview she said that in 10 years \u00a0Rhode Island will need $1 billion to cover its pension obligations and the state won\u2019t be able to afford that. The entire pension system has to change, she said.\n\nAny ruling that public employees have property rights to their pensions could make it much more difficult to change the system, because both the federal and state Constitutions prohibit the taking of private property for public uses without compensation.\n\nSo was Raimondo right when she said that workers\u2019 \"property rights\" to their pensions hadn\u2019t been established in law? We decided to check.\n\nThere is a lawsuit pending against the state, filed by state employee unions to reverse cutbacks in their pensions that were made in 2009 and 2010 by the General Assembly. That lawsuit contends that the pension changes violated their contracts and also constituted a \"takings\" of the employees\u2019 property without \"just compensation.\"\n\nThe 2009 and 2010 pension cutbacks included increasing the minimum retirement age, reducing the percentage of pay on which pensions are based, and limits on cost of living increases. They are expected to save taxpayers $59.4 million in the current fiscal year.\n\nKey people on both sides of the lawsuit were reluctant to discuss the property-rights issue last week. Ken DeLorenzo, executive director of the union, would say only: \"We believe the government can\u2019t take away your life or your property.\"\n\nAttorney Lynette Labinger, the unions\u2019 lead lawyer, said that the case is still in its early stages and a long way from settled.\n\nAttorney John Tarantino, who is representing the state in the case, also declined to say much about the litigation, but added, \"I can say this, we intend to dispute the union\u2019s allegations\" concerning property rights over worker pensions.\n\nWe asked Raimondo\u2019s spokeswoman, Joy Fox, what Raimondo based her statement on. She \u00a0said that Raimondo, a lawyer, \u00a0was referring to \"case law,\" specifically an April 13, 2010, decision by U.S. District Court Judge William E. Smith.\n\nSmith\u2019s ruling came in a lawsuit filed in Providence by Council 94, the state\u2019s largest public employee union, to block changes the legislature made to health benefits for some of its members.\n\nSmith rejected all of the union arguments, including one that the reduction in health benefits violated state and federal \"takings clauses\u2019\u2019 that forbid the taking of private property for public use without just compensation. While he cited other cases involving pension benefits, Smith\u2019s ruling was specifically about health-care benefits.\n\nSo we sought other guidance. We contacted attorney Daniel K. Kinder, a labor lawyer with 30 years of experience, mostly representing management. Kinder was one of two lawyers who testified in 2008 before a special Rhode Island House commission studying the state\u2019s pension system.\n\nHe said he\u2019s certain that Raimondo\u2019s statement is correct. No court, he said, has established property rights to Rhode Island state employee pensions.\n\n(The other lawyer who testified, Gerard Cobleigh, who often represents the state employee unions, couldn\u2019t be reached.)\n\nIn their 2008 testimony, Kinder and Cobleigh said state employees pensions are protected by contracts and by statutes. They described a sliding scale of legal risk to the state if it makes changes to \u00a0the pension benefits, with the least risk for new employees to the most risk for those retired.\n\nFinally, we reached out to Roger Williams University School of Law, where we talked to Professor Bruce Kogan. He said property rights to public-sector pensions could be determined by statute or judicial decision, but he was unaware of either happening in Rhode Island.\n\nThat opinion was seconded by Michael Yelnosky, a professor of labor and employment law at Roger Williams. He said he has not seen any case in state or local federal courts that establishes property rights for pensions.\n\nSo where are we?\n\n* Raimondo\u2019s spokeswoman cited a federal court ruling to back up her claim that public workers don\u2019t have an established property right to their pensions. That ruling provides some support to her statement; a separate state case that raises the issue is unresolved.\n\n* A prominent labor lawyer and two law professors agree that, as Raimondo suggests, the issue has yet to be resolved in Rhode Island.\n\nSo until a court rules otherwise, Raimondo\u2019s statement is True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13521"}
