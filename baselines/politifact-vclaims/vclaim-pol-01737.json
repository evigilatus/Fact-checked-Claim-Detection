They\u2019ve backed us up with North Korea. They are a good trading partner, even though they\u2019ve not acted so well with our elections. They\u2019ve tampered with our elections quite a bit,\" Denham said in the July 24, 2018 interview.\n\nDenham makes his claim at the 15:00 minute mark in the video above.\u00a0\nRussia, not China, has been the focus of a U.S. investigation into election meddling since 2016.\nThe Russian government, according to U.S. intelligence agencies, interfered in the 2016 presidential election through a widespread hacking and misinformation campaign. In their January 2017 report, the agencies said:\n\"We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election. Russia\u2019s goals were to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump. We have high confidence in these judgments.\"\nRussia\u2019s interference remains the focus of U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s ongoing investigation.\nBut we wanted to know whether there\u2019s evidence showing China has \"tampered with our elections quite a bit,\" as Denham claimed.\nWe decided to fact-check that very specific and serious charge.\nBackground on Denham\nDenham is seeking his fifth term\u00a0representing California\u2019s 10th Congressional District. He is being challenged by Democrat Josh Harder, a college instructor and businessman. The race is considered one of four toss ups in California by the Cook Political Report.\nDenham sits on House committees\u00a0on transportation, agriculture and natural resources, but doesn\u2019t sit on any panels that would regularly discuss elections or foreign interference. His office did not say the claim comes from classified information.\nSimilar claim rated False\nDenham\u2019s statement that China has interfered in U.S. elections isn\u2019t common.\nBut there was one high-profile allegation fact-checked last year by PolitiFact Wisconsin.\nIn July 2017, then White House chief-of-staff Reince Priebus said on \"Fox News Sunday\" that \"It\u2019s an absolute fact\" that China and North Korea \"have consistently over many, many years\" meddled in U.S. elections.\nTo assess that, PolitiFact Wisconsin contacted a dozen Asian studies and international affairs experts who either said they were unaware of any evidence to back Priebus\u2019 claim or only aware of one example from two decades ago.\nPolitiFact Wisconsin rated Priebus\u2019 claim False, a rating we\u2019ll keep in mind.\nStill no evidence\nWe contacted several of the same experts to find out whether any new information about China had come to light over the past year, since the recent fact check.\nFour experts responded and said there\u2019s still nothing to support the claim that China has consistently interfered in U.S. elections. Like many other countries, China does try to influence the American political process, particularly through lobbying. That\u2019s not the same, the experts said, as the pervasive Russian meddling in elections.\n\"I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s any evidence of China as a government acting to interfere in the elections in order to either disrupt the process or to tip the election one way or the other,\" said Yoshiko Herrera, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who has studied Russian election interference.\nHerrera is the former director of the school\u2019s Center for Russia, East Europe and Central Asia.\n\"I see no indication from U.S. officials, from intelligence officials, that suggests China has been meddling in U.S. elections,\" added Robert Ross, political science professor at Boston College and associate at the Center for Chinese Studies at Harvard University.\nThere\u2019s little doubt that China has the technological ability to interfere in U.S. elections, Ross said. But its government is likely showing restraint in this arena, he said, because such action would draw negative attention from the U.S. and distract from China\u2019s other goals, such as its military buildup in the South China Sea.\n\"I know of no evidence that China has tampered with US elections,\" Susan Shirk, a UC San Diego research professor and chair of the 21st Century China Center at the school, wrote in an email. \"China is increasing its efforts at public diplomacy/propaganda, to get people to have a positive view of China, but there are no reports of campaign contributions or meddling with the online information environment similar to those made about Russia.\"\nDenham\u2019s response\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 28, 2021 in a blog\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook tried to \u201cshut down\u201d the campaign to recall California Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Chris Nichols \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsked to support the statement, Denham\u2019s spokeswoman Emily Carlin wrote in an email that China\u2019s tampering in U.S. elections was \"commonly accepted facts.\"\nShe then rephrased what the congressman said, writing, \"As far as Chinese efforts to influence our political process, there has been increasing evidence of this.\"\nShe provided links to news articles from NPR, CNBC and CBS SF Bay Area, along with a U.S. intelligence report to support the claim. And while that material shows China poses a cyber and espionage threat and has run disinformation campaigns in Taiwan and Austrailia, it includes no claims China has interfered or tampered with U.S. elections.\nAlleged Chinese spy\nIn her response, Denham\u2019s spokeswoman cited news reports that a staffer who once worked for U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein had a connection to Chinese spying.\nVictor Shih, an associate professor at the School of International Relations and Pacific Studies at UC San Diego, said, however, there\u2019s no indication the staffer had any role in election interference.\nShih said another matter from the 1990s, and not cited by Denham\u2019s office, does show one \"clear case of China trying to influence elections.\"\nIn 1996, Johnny Chung, a Taiwanese-born California businessman, pleaded guilty to illegally funneling money from China to President Bill Clinton and the Democratic National Committee during Clinton\u2019s re-election campaign.\nChung later testified before Congress that the donations included $35,000 from the head of China's military intelligence agency to Clinton\u2019s successful reelection effort.\nThe FBI even warned six members of Congress at the time: \"We have reason to believe that the government of China may try to make contributions to members of Congress through Asian donors.\"\nShih and the other experts we contacted said, however, the Chung matter does not represent a widespread, persistent effort by China to interfere in U.S. elections. China is suspected, he added, of conducting a recent and broad political influence campaign in Australia.\n\"Meddling, of course, there are some cases of it (by China in the United States),\" Shih said. \"But to say that it\u2019s pervasive or everywhere, I think it\u2019s a bit of a stretch.\"\nCiting Denham\u2019s words, Herrera added that \"Tamper suggests \u2026 breaking into something or inappropriately changing something. It doesn\u2019t just suggest buying influence, for example.\"\nOur ruling\nCongressman Jeff Denham recently claimed China has \"tampered with our elections quite a bit.\" Last year, PolitiFact Wisconsin surveyed a dozen international affairs experts to examine a similar claim and found no evidence China has conducted widespread election interference.\nIt found one case in 1996 of illegal campaign contributions by a Taiwanese-born California businessman to Bill Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign. The example, however, was not part of a sustained, pervasive election interference. Experts said they consider it an example of buying influence, but not comprehensive election tampering.\nWe reached four experts to ask whether any information over the past year had changed their assessment. They told us there\u2019s still nothing to support the charge that China has \"tampered with our elections quite a bit.\"\nThey added that China, like many countries, does attempt to influence America\u2019s political process, mainly through lobbying, but does not have a record of election meddling anywhere approaching Russia\u2019s.\nWe rate\u00a0Denham\u2019s claim False.\n\nFALSE\u00a0\u2013\u00a0The statement is not accurate.\nClick here for\u00a0more\u00a0on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.\nUPDATE:\u00a0\nAfter we published our fact check, Denham\u2019s office provided additional news reports, contending \"there is significantly more of a case\" for the congressman\u2019s claim than we showed in our fact check.\nThe articles, which center on China\u2019s alleged hacking of the Obama and McCain presidential campaigns in 2008, were not part of the congressman\u2019s initial response. But we reviewed them and consulted several experts on China to evaluate whether they, in fact, make more of a case for Denham\u2019s statement.\nDenham\u2019s office pointed mainly to an NBC News investigation published in June 2013. It quoted Dennis Blair, President Obama\u2019s director of national intelligence in 2009 and 2010, as saying: \"Based on everything I know, this was a case of political cyberespionage by the Chinese government against the two American political parties. They were looking for positions on China, surprises that might be rolled out by campaigns against China.\"\nThe NBC report added: \"The goal of the campaign intrusion, according to (U.S. Intelligence) officials: to export massive amounts of internal data from both campaigns\u2014including internal position papers and private emails of key advisers in both camps.\"\nRobert Ross of the Center for Chinese Studies at Harvard University told us in an email the 2008 hacking case \"does not show evidence of tampering in elections, but rather of an espionage campaign aimed at collecting intelligence on the likely US policies of US presidential candidates.\"\n\"In this respect,\" he added, \"it is no different from any other intelligence collection effort. This was not tampering, but rather collection. There is a difference between such operations that must not be overlooked.\"\nRoss said the difference is that tampering aims to influence political outcomes in the United States, while intelligence collection \"aims to improve the foreign policies of the state collecting the intelligence.\"\nAdditional experts said even if the 2008 case was considered \"tampering,\" they would still take issue with Denham\u2019s characterization of China tampering with U.S. elections \"quite a bit.\"\n\"Folks from the government may know more, but I have not seen any pervasive patterns,\" wrote Victor Shih, associate professor at the School of International Relations and Pacific Studies at UC San Diego.\nThe additional information from Denham\u2019s office supports the idea that China has conducted widespread intelligence collection to influence America\u2019s political process.\nBut that\u2019s not the same as tampering, which we and the experts we spoke with interpreted as attempting to alter election results, such as Russia\u2019s effort in 2016. Even if it did fit that category, it would not be \"quite a bit.\"\nOur rating on Denham\u2019s claim remains the same: False.\n Share the Facts 2018-08-14 21:15:30 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  China has \"not acted so well with our elections.
