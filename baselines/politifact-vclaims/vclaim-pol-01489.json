Jack Posobiec, who is credited with planting the sign, also heavily promoted the debunked Pizzagate conspiracy theory and helped organize the DeploraBall, an informal inauguration party marked by clashes between Trump\u2019s supporters and protesters.\nThe photo was posted more recently by Joshua Feuerstein, a former pastor who uses social media to promote his vision of evangelical Christianity. Feuerstein notably made headlines in 2015 for his viral video attacking Starbucks over its holiday cups.\nThe reposted 2016 photo shows someone in a crowd of people holding a sign that says \"Rape Melania.\"\n\"This is the tolerant left #MeToo movement ... suggesting a sexual assault against the First Lady!!!
