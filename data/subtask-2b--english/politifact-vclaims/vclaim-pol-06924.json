Bogus, a Fox Business host claimed recently.\nIn a discussion about waning personal freedom in the free world, pundit John Stossel went off about the onslaught of government rules and regulations telling Americans what they can do and when, where and how they can do it.\nHe used cigarette-smoking as an example, arguing that business owners should have the right to allow smoking in their bars or restaurants even where ordinances or laws ban the practice.\n\"Yeah, they kill smokers,\" Stossel said on Fox & Friends of cigarettes. \"But there is no good data showing secondhand smoke kills people.\"\nA Fox spokeswoman did not return our inquiry, and Stossel, who has long questioned the lethal nature of secondhand smoke, did not reply to emails and tweets. (The exchange in question was a follow-up to a Dec. 4 segment on his Thursday show, when he said, \"the secondhand smoke scare turns out to be bunk. But the smokers still take it.\")\nStossel\u2019s definition of \"good\" might be different than ours, but there is plenty of scientific research and consensus that secondhand smoke does indeed kill people.\nSecondhand smoke is a mixture of smoke emitted from the burning end of a cigarette or other tobacco products and what\u2019s exhaled by smokers. It\u2019s regarded as a cancer-causing agent, a \"known human carcinogen\" (a healthful classification, that is not).\nThe government has campaigned for tough anti-smoking policies in public places and workplaces as a way to protect Americans from secondhand smoke, saying there is no safe level of exposure. Reports from the country\u2019s top doctors say these laws are reducing risk.\nThe U.S. surgeon general has released 31 reports about the effects of smoking since 1964. These reports are extremely detailed, summarizing the latest research on smoking and peer-reviewed by dozens of the nation\u2019s top scientists.\nConsensus on secondhand smoke really began to form in the 1980s, even as the tobacco industry\u2019s\"doubt-creation machine\" spun opposing talking points, said Dr. Jonathan Samet, senior scientific editor of the 2014 surgeon general report and director of the University of Southern California\u2019s Institute for Global Health.\nThe surgeon general\u2019s 2006 report stated rather bluntly that inhaling secondhand smoke \"causes lung cancer and coronary heart disease in nonsmoking adults.\" Involuntary exposure to tobacco smoke killed more than 49,000 nonsmokers in 2005, plus 430 newborns who died of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, the report said.\nIn 2014,\u00a0the acting surgeon general released a new report, one that factored in input from more than 80 contributing authors and 150 reviewers who are experts in medicine and public health.\u00a0Secondhand smoke can also increase risk of stroke, the new report found. Beyond that, involuntary exposure poses significant problems for children, worsening asthma and leading to other respiratory conditions.\nSince 1964, the report said, 2.46 million non-smokers have died from exposure to secondhand smoke.\nHow does the government calculate its numbers?\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScientists don\u2019t keep a count of deaths by secondhand smoke as recorded in death certificates. (Death certificates don\u2019t list \"secondhand smoke\" as a cause of death.) Instead, they rely on statistical methods used by epidemiologists, who are experts in disease patterns within populations. To figure out lung cancer deaths from secondhand smoke, for instance, the individual risk of lung cancer is analyzed next to the proportion of people exposed to secondhand smoke.\nIt\u2019s a complicated statistical analysis (page 659 explains more), one with which Stossel obviously finds fault. But it\u2019s not unusual. The same method is used to attribute the number of deaths from obesity through diabetes, for example, Samet said.\n\"This is the basic way to use to understand how the disease is exposed to this risk,\" Samet said. \"We understand that there are uncertainties that go with this, but this is a very basic tool. ... The approach here is embedded in science and policy and understanding how much a disease is caused by something.\"\nThe surgeon general is not alone in major scientific organizations linking secondhand smoke with deadly diseases. There\u2019s also the World Health Organization\u2019s International Center for Research on Cancer, the Environmental Protection Agency, the American Cancer Society, and the National Academy of Sciences.\n\"At this point, the evidence is firm and very powerful, and important conclusions have been reached,\" Samet said.\nYou can quibble over specific numbers since they\u2019re approximations, said Gary Giovino, a professor of health behavior at the University at Buffalo, State University of New York. But not that secondhand smoke kills, he said.\n\"Chronic exposure produces disease and death,\" Giovino said.\nHow do folks such as Stossel respond?\nThe libertarian Cato Institute published a response to the 2006 surgeon general\u2019s report on secondhand smoke that highlighted testimony before a committee of the British Parliament by Oxford epidemiologist Richard Peto. Peto, who has studied the causes of cancer and the effects of smoking, testified that he could not quantify deaths from secondhand smoke because \"these hazards cannot be directly measured.\" (The story was written by Gio Gori, an epidemiologist who wrote publications on behalf of the industry-backed Tobacco Institute refuting studies about nicotine\u2019s harmful effects.)\nConversely, some scientists say the government is actually undercounting secondhand smoke-related deaths.\n\"The criticism \u2026 is not that they overestimate the risk, it\u2019s that they\u2019re underestimating it,\" \u00a0said Stanton Glantz, a University of California San Francisco medicine professor and director of the Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education.\nAnd dog lovers, beware: New evidence shows secondhand smoke can also kill pets, including lung and nasal cancer in dogs and malignant lymphoma in cats.\nOur ruling\nStossel said \"there is no good data showing secondhand smoke kills people.\"\nHis definition of good obviously differs with the vast majority of scientists and researchers studying the effects of secondhand smoke. They say the data does show that secondhand smoke kills people. And that the data is indeed solid.\nStossel\u2019s claim rates False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06924"}
