We don't even calculate according to the U.S.,\" said eBay spokeswoman Deanna Monestero. \"I don't want to say it's wrong, but I can't trace it.\"\n\n\nThe latest figures for the U.S. date back to 2005, when an A.C. Nielsen study revealed 724,000 Americans used eBay to make some money. But the survey didn't break down the number to figure out how many were just making a few bucks compared with the number making a living on eBay.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

But once again, the survey didn't break down the \"all\" and \"some\" income numbers.\n\n\nThat same year, Jim Griffith, who is eBay's so-called \"dean of education\" (who knew there was one?), was quoted in a Colorado newspaper as saying, \"More than 20,000 people earn their living selling on eBay in the United States.\"\n\n\nBut a company spokeswoman couldn't say where that number came from, either.\n\n\nThese days, the company only keeps track of eBay entrepreneurs worldwide. That number, based on a 2006 Nielsen study, is estimated at 1.3-million. But again, it doesn't distinguish between full-time and part-time on-line auctioneers.\n\n\nThe bottom line: Lots of people make money on eBay, but how many depend on it to pay their bills remains unclear.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16579"}
