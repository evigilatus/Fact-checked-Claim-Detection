We reached out to Judicial Watch, which denied any affiliation with the post.\n\"Not ours,\" said Jill Farrell, a Judicial Watch spokesperson. \"Just some random person misinterpreting.\"\nFarrell suggested the post may have been a botched interpretation of a lawsuit Judicial Watch brought against the state of California and Los Angeles County.\nThe litigation centers on California\u2019s handling of state voter rolls, which contain a large number of voters who are considered \"inactive.\" Registered voters may be rendered inactive if official election materials like a mail ballot or voter guide are sent and returned as undeliverable.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.

What\u2019s key here is that the Facebook post misses the critical distinction between inactive voters and fraudulent votes.\nJudicial Watch argues that retaining inactive voters on the rolls poses a voting fraud risk. The group does not claim more than a million fraudulent votes were cast in California, as this Facebook post states. At the time the post was circulated, the votes had not even been tallied yet.\u00a0\nWe rate this Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01289"}
