You haven't broken the GOP voting record \u2018by millions\u2019 ... yet", "text": "During a campaign speech in Sacramento on Wednesday, Donald Trump repeated claims about how many votes he\u2019s received in the Republican presidential primary.\n\"We\u2019ve broken the all-time record in the history of the Republican Party\" for votes in a primary election, the presumptive GOP nominee said. \"We\u2019ve broken it by millions.\"\nThis is not the first time Trump has repeated the \"all-time record\" claim while in California. He said it on April 29 at the state\u2019s Republican Party Convention when he was on pace to break the record but was still short at the time. We rated it \"False \u2026 for now.\" He appears to have secured that record now.\nTrump\u2019s victory in the Washington primary nearly a month later, on May 24, put him over the top, said Eric Ostermeier, a political science professor at the University of Minnesota and founder of the number-crunching blog Smart Politics.\nBut we wondered about the second part of Trump\u2019s latest statement: \"We\u2019ve broken it by millions.\"\nHad Trump made a correct claim in one breath only to mangle the truth in the next? We set out on a fact check.\n\nPresumed GOP presidential nominee\u00a0Donald Trump campaigned in Sacramento on June 1, 2016 ahead of California's primary election.\u00a0Jae C. Hong / AP\nOur research \nOstermeier told us Wednesday night that Trump got ahead of himself, once again.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 28, 2021 in a blog\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook tried to \u201cshut down\u201d the campaign to recall California Gov.

Bush\u2019s previous mark set in 2000, which tallied 11.54 million direct primary and caucus votes.\"\nTrump\u2019s campaign had not responded to a request for comment as of Wednesday night.\nThe remaining contests include California, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico and South Dakota, all on June 7.\nOstermeier is not the only one tracking vote tallies. RealClearPolitics.com shows Trump at 11.53 million popular votes -- slightly behind Bush\u2019s 2000 vote total, certainly not \"millions\" ahead.\nTrump\u2019s 2016 vote count has benefitted, Ostermeier said, from a larger national population, a more competitive race and from lasting nearly two months longer than Bush\u2019s contest against Arizona Sen. John McCain. Ostermeier added that Trump also \"lost votes\" to this year\u2019s crowded field of GOP candidates.\nOur ruling\nTrump said he\u2019s broken \"by millions\" the record for GOP\u00a0presidential primary votes.\nWith victories on June 7th, including in California, he may well smash the record. \u00a0But he\u2019s not there yet.\nWe rate Trump\u2019s claim False again \u2026 for now.\n\nFALSE\u00a0\u2013\u00a0The statement is not accurate.\nClick here for\u00a0more\u00a0on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/5e69aa63-1805-4e12-87c5-4c8a5f49be9a", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04889"}
