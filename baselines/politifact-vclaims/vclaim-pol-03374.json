Hedtke transmitted the live video, we confirmed,\u00a0despite the panel\u2019s chairman, Rep. Byron Cook, announcing at the hearing\u2019s outset that anyone making a recording who lacked media credentials would be asked to leave.\nAccording to a March 22, 2017, Texas Department of Public Safety statement provided by the agency at our inquiry, Hedtke, 42, was removed \"after she ignored repeated requests by the House Sergeant-at-Arms to stop recording/live video streaming during the meeting. Signs posted in the meeting room prohibit such action without proper media credentials.\"\nAnthony Holm of Austin, who brought Hedtke's removal\u00a0to our attention, noted an April 2017 news report about Hedtke by WFAA-TV, Channel 8 in Dallas. Hedtke\u2019s removal was reported earlier by the Waxahachie Daily Light.\nHolm asked that we look into whether officials had the authority to act against someone simply taping a hearing as the open-meetings law permits. Our initial inquiries led us to the House's legal explanation in a letter from a House leader, Rep. Charlie Geren, R-Fort Worth, to the TV station that essentially said House rules in keeping with a state constitutional provision let members rule their proceedings regardless of conflicting laws.\nAnd is that accurate?\nA House chairman's explanation\nHedtke\u2019s video plus video shot by another person show her refusing requests that she stop taping and being carried by troopers to a DPS sedan. By phone, Hedtke later told us\u00a0that she was then taken to the Travis County Jail where she was charged with criminal trespass for failing to depart when asked; a court hearing, she said, is scheduled for May 2017.\nHedtke\u2019s video from the hearing shows Hedtke telling an unidentified House aide: \"State law says that open meetings, you cannot prohibit attendees from recording.\" The aide replies: \"The rules of the House have precedence over that \u2014 the Constitution, as well.\"\nGeren, chairman of the powerful House Administration Committee, said\u00a0the same in his April 11, 2017, letter\u00a0to the TV station, which we fielded\u00a0by email after asking Jason Embry, a spokesman for House Speaker Joe Straus, why Hedtke was stopped from recording and carried out.\nGeren's letter\u00a0 says the station\u2019s news account mistakenly indicated the law allowing individuals to record government meetings prevails over House rules giving members control of its proceedings.\nConstitutional provision and House rules\nArticle III, section 11 of the Texas Constitution, Geren wrote, \"authorizes each house of the legislature to determine the rules of its own proceedings.\"\nIn its entirety, the section says: \"Each House may determine the rules of its own proceedings, punish members for disorderly conduct, and, with the consent of two-thirds, expel a member, but not a second time for the same offense.\"\nGeren,\u00a0chairman of the House Administration Committee, further wrote that\u00a0the House\u2019s 2017 rules deem those\u00a0rules to be \"the only requirements binding\" on the 150-member body.\nCorrect: House rules adopted by members at the start of the 2017 legislative session open:\n\"Pursuant to and under the authority of Section 11, Article III, Texas Constitution, and notwithstanding any provision of statute, the House of Representatives adopts the following rules to govern its operations and procedures. The provisions of these rules shall be deemed the only requirements binding on the House of Representatives under Section 11, Article III, Texas Constitution, notwithstanding any other requirements expressed in statute.\"\nWe asked Geren if he wished to elaborate on his letter, which WFAA-TV subsequently excerpted in a note preceding a web version of\u00a0its story; he did not.\nIn the latest House rules themselves, meantime, we didn\u2019t spot any provision that a House member can obviate the open-meetings law including its provision that people can record meetings. Otherwise, the rules require the House to post video of public meetings and specify that permission to make live or recorded television, radio, or Internet broadcasts in or from the House chamber when the House is in session may be granted only by the administration committee.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo shows man upset because he was added to the no-fly list for storming the Capitol.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMurky?\nSection 551.023 of Texas\u2019s government code, part of the open-meetings law that came to be in 1973, says: \"A person in attendance may record all or any part of an open meeting of a governmental body by means of a recorder, video camera or other means of aural or visual reproduction.\" But, the law says, a governmental body \"may adopt reasonable rules to maintain order at a meeting, including\" rules relating to the location of recording equipment and how the recording is made. The law also says those rules \"may not prevent or unreasonably impair a person from\" recording during a meeting.\nSo, what gives?\nAngling to sort this out, and with help from Kelley Shannon of the Freedom of Information Foundation of Texas, we queried Austin attorneys steeped in Texas open government laws.\nEach one agreed that no court has ruled on the ability of the House or Senate to invoke the constitutional provision about the bodies setting\u00a0internal rules to bypass the permission spelled out in the Texas Open Meetings Act for people to record meetings. Likewise, we found no sign of any such\u00a0court interpretation when we reviewed materials available\u00a0at the Texas State Law Library.\nThe lawyers diverged, though, on whether Geren\u2019s explanation holds up.\n\"It gets murky,\" said David Donaldson of Austin, a retired lawyer whose past clients include the Austin American-Statesman, one of the newspapers that sponsors PolitiFact Texas. By phone, Donaldson added: \"The answer may be that we don\u2019t know the answer yet.\" Over the course of a couple days, Donaldson told us, he was swayed by conflicting arguments both for and against a person being able to record a legislative meeting.\nBob Heath, who has advised lawmakers in the past, and Buck Wood, who helped write the open-meetings law, each said the constitution\u2019s language supports what Geren told the station. To his chagrin, Wood said by phone, House members reinforced such a stance by adopting the provision leading its rules stating\u00a0the body\u2019s rules shall be deemed the \"only\" requirements binding on the House, regardless of state laws.\nIn contrast, attorneys Bill Aleshire and Jennifer Riggs each suggested a portion of the open-meetings law signals an overarching legislative commitment to complying with the open-meetings law. Section 551.003 of the state\u2019s Government Code states: \"In this chapter, the legislature is exercising its powers to adopt rules to prohibit secret meetings of the legislature, committees of the legislature, and other bodies associated with the legislature, except as specifically permitted in the constitution.\"\nBy email, Aleshire maintained that the section protects the open-meetings law from being preempted by lawmakers any which way. He noted also that the Constitution doesn\u2019t say the Legislature has the power to outlaw recordings.\nAnother hearing, another approach\nWhile checking this claim, we noticed that days after troopers carried Hedtke out, a different House chairman, Rep. Phil King, R-Weatherford, let people at a hearing, including Hedtke, take pictures and shoot video.\nAccording to House-posted video, just after the start of the March 28, 2017, meeting of the Homeland Security & Public Safety panel, King said: \"We want to talk a little bit about cameras and things like that. I\u2019m going to be a little flexible there.\" King directed anyone taking photos to do so from the back of the Capitol hearing room. \"The rule of the day,\" he said, \"is don\u2019t disturb other people when you do it.\"\nHedtke told us, and King confirmed, that she later got King\u2019s permission to move her camera closer to the front of the room; intermittent noise from the hallway was marring her recording from the back.\nKing, asked why he laid out guidelines for people to record the meeting, told us he recognized before the hearing that people following issues before the panel wanted to record or livestream.\nBy phone, King said he\u2019s aware of the\u00a0law that says anyone can record a government meeting. Yet, he said, his decision to let people take photos or video was based on his discretion under House rules to run the hearing as the committee\u2019s chairman. King said it\u2019s the duty of any chair \"to make sure the meeting is smooth, efficient and not disrupted.\"\nHow did the permission to record affect the hearing? \"It was fine,\" King told us. \"Everybody behaved themselves.\"\nOur ruling\nGeren wrote that House rules authorized by the Texas Constitution supersede the state law permitting anyone to record an open government meeting.\nWe find that a\u00a0constitutional provision plus sweeping House-adopted language that arguably lets the body operate without regard to any law support the chairman's statement. But it's also worth clarifying that the rub with the 1973 law allowing anyone to record a government meeting has yet to be dissected\u00a0by a court.\nWe rate the claim Mostly True.\n\nMOSTLY TRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

See the Austin American-Statesman's news story on the ruling here. This action wouldn't bear on our past rating of Geren's statement in that the judge acted after Geren made his claim.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03374"}
