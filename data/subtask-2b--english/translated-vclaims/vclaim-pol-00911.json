The claim requires clarification but is mostly accurate. \"Eating capacity: 76416\" said the text at the top of the picture of a football field. A sign in the picture that says \"heads,\" refers to the football team from Kansas City, Mo. In February alone there were enough illegal immigrants who crossed the border to fill this stadium. The March 11 article was announced as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in the broadcast of the news. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Kansas City Presidents play at the Arrowhead Stadium, which can fit 76,416 people, according to the records and facts of NFL 2018. \u2219 (Gennis's crowd noise record is also carried, found by Polyte Vac Messouri.) So this part of the claim is accurate. Did 76,416 people illegally cross the border in February? That's close. Facebook does not specify that it speaks of the south-west border, but it probably refers to immigration data on the south-west border published monthly by United States Customs and Border Protection. Facebook was published on January 22, 2021 in a Facebook article on Hank Aaron's death due to a COVID-19 vaccine. \u2022 January 26, 2012, in February, the Border Patrol carried out 66,450 arrests on the south-west border. Fear data are usually used as a measure of illegal migration. The figure indicates concerns between ports of entry. Customs and border protection also issue monthly data on the number of persons who wish to enter the United States legally but who have been deported by border officers. The absence of appropriate travel documents is one of the reasons why a person is denied entry. This part is classified as \"not allowed.\" In February, 9,653 persons were declared inadmissible after having presented themselves at ports of entry along the south-west border. In addition to the number of persons arrested for illegal entry and the number of persons who wanted to enter legally but were denied entry, this results in 76,103 persons. (It is unclear whether there is an overlap in the figures; for example, if a person subsequently refuses legal entry, he or she tries to enter illegally. The article indicates that it is mainly Mexicans who cross the border illegally by highlighting the Mexican flag in the middle of the stadium. Most of the migrants currently detained at the border are from Central America, not Mexico. Recent observation on the use of mail for \"illegal immigrants:\" many people crossing the border seek protection from asylum. In order to seek asylum, immigrants must be present in the United States. Federal and international laws allow migrants to seek asylum whether they have arrived here legally or illegally. With those warnings, we assess the claim mostly true.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00911"}
