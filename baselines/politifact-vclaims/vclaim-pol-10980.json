Spokesman Ryan Williams pointed us to Massachusetts\u2019 median household incomes from 2002, the last year before Romney became governor, through 2006, the final full year he was in office. Here are the figures:\n\n2002: $49,855\n2003: $50,955\n2004: $52,019\n2005: $56,017\n2006: $55,330\n\nSo the hard numbers are accurate. The median income in Massachusetts rose $5,475 from 2002 to 2006.\n\nRomney\u2019s influence\n\nWhen rating claims such as these, PolitiFact weighs not only whether the claim is numerically correct but also whether it\u2019s appropriate for the speaker to assign credit or blame.\n\nSaid Fred Bayles, a former reporter who covered Romney\u2019s administration: \"Any set of numbers related to the economy is kind of like reporting on the tides and ascribing an individual responsibility to a force of nature.\"\n\nBarry Bluestone, dean of the school of Public Policy and Urban Affairs at Northeastern University, said that \"governors, in general, have little direct impact on employment or income in the short run. They can set the stage for future growth in jobs and income if they invest heavily in education and in infrastructure, but this did not occur during Romney\u2019s term in office.\"\n\nHe also noted that the census income figures are not adjusted for inflation, a point echoed by Andrew Bagley, director of research and public affairs for the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation.\n\nBagley crunched the numbers for us taking inflation into account. Using data from Moody\u2019s Analytics, the median household income in Massachusetts increased by roughly 2.8 percent annual growth during Romney\u2019s term, Bagley said. The nationwide consumer price index (CPI), which shows how much inflation grew during the same period, was 2.9 percent per year.\n\n\"So, the answer provided by Gillespie appears accurate. But, if someone said that \u2018real\u2019 Massachusetts median household income fell during Gov. Romney\u2019s four years in office from 2002 Q4 to 2006 Q4, that would also be accurate because the average annual growth of 2.8 percent was below the inflation rate of 2.9 percent, so real incomes actually declined,\" Bagley wrote in an email.\n\nWhen you factor that in with slow job growth -- Massachusetts private-sector employment grew by just 0.79 percent during Romney\u2019s term -- Bluestone said the outcome is not surprising.\n\n\"There really was nothing that Romney accomplished as governor that would have increased jobs or income,\" he said. Bluestone has donated $700 to Obama's campaign since 2011.\n\nBayles, who now directs the Boston University Statehouse Program, also added that Massachusetts\u2019 income gains lagged behind the national average, 11 percent compared with 14.2 percent.\n\n\"Does that mean Romney could be criticized for Massachusetts underperforming the national average? Probably not.\"\n\nHe said outside economic forces made the biggest difference.\n\n\"The Massachusetts economy took a slightly bigger hit when the tech bubble burst and was a bit slower in recovering. There were forces much larger than a four-year term that impacted all these numbers,\" Bayles said.\n\nJeffrey Berry, a political scientist at Tufts University, summed it up this way: \"The macroeconomic changes instituted by the Romney administration were far too modest to be responsible for a change in average income of this magnitude. It's far more likely that most of the change in Massachusetts were a reflection of national policies and trends.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nGillespie\u2019s statement that median family incomes in Massachusetts grew by $5,500 during Romney\u2019s term is numerically accurate.\n\nHowever, that dollar figure is not adjusted for inflation, and two experts told us that after inflation is taken into account, real incomes in Massachusetts actually declined slightly. What\u2019s more, governors in general have little impact on immediate-term gains in jobs and incomes.\n\nGillespie\u2019s statement leaves out those important details, leaving the inaccurate impression that Massachusetts families were significantly better off under Romney. We rate it Half True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H.
