A few moments later, he criticized Obama for voting for the 2005 energy bill, which McCain said was full of unnecessary spending.\n\n\n\"It was festooned with Christmas tree ornaments,\" McCain said. \"It had all kinds of breaks for the oil companies, I mean, billions of dollars worth. I voted against it; Sen. Obama voted for it.\"\n\n\n\"John, you want to give oil companies another $4-billion,\" Obama retorted.\n\n\nWe've checked the controversy over\n\nObama's energy vote previously\n\n. We found the bill, which did become law, included both incentives for clean energy and tax breaks for oil companies. Obama\n\nhas said\n\nhe felt the good in the bill outweighed the bad.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

Specifically, they cite a study from the left-leaning Center for American Progress Action Fund. That group analyzed financial statements from the Securities and Exchange Commission for the five largest oil companies\u00a0and calculated current and deferred taxes paid in 2007 to the federal government for income earned from U.S. operations. They then calculated how much less those companies would pay if the corporate tax rate were dropped from 35 percent to 25 percent. The total savings to the five oil companies, $3.8-billion; $1.2-billion Exxon Mobil alone.\n\n\nIn our previous look at this $4-billion claim, Obama didn't mention McCain's\u00a0position on cutting corporate taxes for all companies.\u00a0We concluded that Obama was cherry-picking by singling out oil companies. That led us to rule his statement Barley True.\n\n\nBut at the debate, the two candidates had just discussed McCain's position on corporate taxes and were talking about how overarching policy could affect tax breaks for oil companies. The context of the exchange explained McCain's overall policy on corporate taxes. As a result, when Obama made the claim in the debate, it was True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-15958"}
