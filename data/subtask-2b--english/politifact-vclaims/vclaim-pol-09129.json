Among them is Ohio.\n\n\nFreedomOhio, an advocacy group pushing to overturn Ohio's ban, said the high court's decisions add momentumto its effort to get the issue on the November 2014 ballot.\n\n\nCitizens for Community Values, a Cincinnati-based conservative group that championed the 2004 constitutional ban, said it was ready to fight measures that would bring same-sex marriage to the state.\n\n\nPhil Burress, president of the group, was quoted sayingin March that legalizing same-sex marriage in Ohio is unlikely: \"I can't look into the future, but I just don't ever see it happening. This nation was founded on Judeo-Christian principles, and, like Judeo-Christian beliefs, every major religion is opposed to same-sex marriage. You can't allow same-sex marriage until you destroy all religions.\"\n\n\nWhile his last sentence is matter of opinion that PolitiFact Ohio can't rate, we wondered about the accuracy of his statement about religious opposition.\n\n\nThe Supreme Court decisions affected the legal recognition of marriage under civil law. They do not extend to religious recognition.\n\n\nBut what do religions say about same-sex marriage?\n\n\nCitizens for Community Valuestold us it stands behind the statement by Burress, which was also cited in a Plain Dealer story last month, and added: \"The mainstream, conservative and orthodox majorities of the primary religions in America, that is Judaism, Christianity and Islam, oppose same-sex marriage.\"\n\n\nThey referred us to a comprehensive survey of the U.S. religious landscapeby the nonpartisan Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life. It details the country's current religious makeup and changes in religious affiliation.\n\n\nPew also presents an overview of official positions on same-sex marriageamong major religions in the United States. These are the findings, summarized alphabetically:\n\n\n\n\nAmerican Baptist Churches USA has affirmed that \"God's design for sexual intimacy places it within the context of marriage between one man and one woman.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuddhism has no universal position on same-sex marriage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops opposes same-sex marriage, affirming that \"marriage is a faithful, exclusive and lifelong union between one man and one woman.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints does not endorse same-sex marriage; Mormon theology says that \"marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on February 7, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Satan flashed in the halftime Super Bowl satanic ritual.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 February 8, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe General Convention of the Episcopal Church last year approved a liturgy for blessing same-sex relationships. \"Each Episcopal bishop will decide whether to allow churches in his or her jurisdiction to use the new liturgy to bless same-sex unions,\" Pew reports. \"And in those dioceses where blessing same-sex relationships is permissible, no Episcopal priest will be required to perform the blessing ceremony.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvangelical Lutheran Church in America defines marriage as \"a lifelong covenant of faithfulness between a man and a woman,\" but allowed congregations to recognize and bless same-sex unions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHinduism has no official position on same-sex marriage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIslamic law forbids homosexuality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Judaism, the Reform and Reconstructionist Jewish movements support gay and lesbian rights, including same-sex marriage. The Conservative Jewish movement has a ceremony to allow same-sex couples to marry.
