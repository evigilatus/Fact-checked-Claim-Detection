Ted Cruz that Trump was in favour of the United States helping the deposed Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. Trump said, \"He said I'm in Libya's favor,\" and Trump said, \"He seems confused. \"I never discussed this subject.\" I was in favour of Libya? We'd be better off if Qadhafi was in charge now.\" Trump discussed it. And thanks to Bazvid, we have the video. (All advice hats to Andrew Kazinsky.) It comes from 2011 on Trump's video blog. Trump said, \"I can't believe what our country is doing,\" according to a copy of Bazved. \"Radafi in Libya kills thousands of people, no one knows how bad it is, and we sit around and we have all soldiers in the Middle East, and we don't bring them to stop this terrible massacre and that's what it is: it's a massacre.\" Keep going, Trump. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" By Samantha Butterman: January 11, 2021 \"You're talking about things that happened in history; it could be one of the worst,\" said Trump. \"Now we have to go in, we have to stop this guy, which will be so easy and so fast. We can do it surgically, prevent it from doing it, and save these lives. This is completely insane. We don't want to get involved and you'll end up with something you've never seen before.\" Then Trump said, \"But we have to go save these lives; these people are slaughtered like animals.\" \"It's terrible what's going on, it has to be stopped. We must do on a humanitarian basis, immediately go to Libya, beat this man out very quickly, very surgically, very effective, and save lives.\" The United States army, working with NATO, spent about $2 billion and several months supporting the Libyan revolution against Gaddafi, which had been in control of power for decades. The intifada - part of the Arab Spring - was overthrown in August 2011 and killed by rebel forces in the following October. Trump tried to claim during Houston's debate that he never discussed support for United States intervention in Libya. This is clearly inaccurate, as Trump's own words show. This prosecution appreciates pants on fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05364"}
