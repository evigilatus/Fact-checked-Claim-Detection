At the end of September, the Public Prosecutor of California, Javier Picera, had filed or joined 60 proceedings against the Trump administration. His office also submitted notes to the Friends of the Court in several additional cases against the Administration. But California really \"wins\" in court, Capesera and Goff. Gavin Newsome claims so confidently? \"We win. \"Newsome said at a press conference on September 16, in the capital. Bessera was equally confident: \"Every time we go to court, we often win,\" Bessera claimed at a press conference in late August when one of the 14 immigration lawsuits in California was announced since the President took office. This case seeks to impede the operation of the rules of the Trump administration, which may detain migrant children and their families indefinitely. \"If I were a baseball player, my rate of beating would be envy of MLB,\" he blabbed in the Mercury News article in May. \"We prove that no one is above the law, including the President of the United States.\" We began to verify Becerra's claim: \"Every time we go to court, we often win.\" We researched CalMatters, a non-profit news organization, along with a professor of political science at the University of Marquette, which separately followed California's suits against the Trump administration. The records obtained from Becerra's claim generally support the fact that the State wins in court, at least in cases where judgements have been handed down so far, although they also show that the majority of judicial proceedings are pending a final decision. The Calmutter database of 60 lawsuits showed that the State had won 16 completed cases and had lost 2 cases, while 38 were pending and 4 were pending, until late September. California has made some clear victories. In July, he prevailed in his efforts to prevent the Trump administration from adding citizenship to the 2020 census after the United States Supreme Court had ruled against this move and Trump had abandoned his plan. The State also won a case against the Administration &apos; s attempt in 2017 to cut off some federal funds from \"inventory\" jurisdictions. A local court ruled that the transfer was unconstitutional. (California) filed a second lawsuit against the administration last year after withholding money for similar reasons. The state has also won several cases in which an action has been brought to ensure the implementation of federal regulations on energy and the environment. In February, the state was dealt with one of its few defeats following a lawsuit to prevent the Trump administration from relinquishing environmental laws to accelerate the construction of the California border wall. :: Judgement of a federal district judge, followed by an appellate body in favour of Trump. The State also lost a case in which it joined in opposing the Tramp travel ban from several predominantly Muslim countries. The first version of the prohibition was abolished by a lower court, while a second version partially entered into force but expired thereafter. A third version was confirmed by the Supreme Court in June 2018. Earlier in the easy news conference in August, the Attorney General presented a more accurate and complete version of his statement about California's victory in court. \"Unfortunately, almost 60 times now this administration has taken actions that would harm the people of California. In most of the cases we have brought, we have so far won the verdicts we secured, \"I told Becerra the journalists. A spokesman for Becerra provided a list of cases brought by the State against the Trump administration, together with information on their respective cases, although there was no explicit breakdown of profit/loss. \"Some have been deduced, but many continue,\" wrote the speaker in an e-mail. \"California has been a great success in court,\" Paul Nolet, Professor of Political Science Marchett, tracking all multi-state lawsuits against the Trump administration. His database contains the majority of cases brought by California against the Administration, although there are no 13 individual cases brought by the State against him. In mid-September, Noelette said that California had succeeded in at least 90 per cent of the multi-state lawsuits that had received a preliminary judgement, although he warned that most cases were still awaiting a final judgement. Devin Nunes reported on January 10, 2021 in an interview on \"The Republicans have no means of communication\" after the Barler tech companies were cut off. By Amy Sherman on January 13, 2021 \"California has had great success in court against Trump's administration, considering both completed cases, as well as other cases that are still on their way through the system,\" Nulet said. \u2022 The State is involved in 53 multi-state lawsuits against the Trump administration. Of these, 21 cases have been completed and 32 are pending final judgement. Two of them were voluntarily rejected and said that California &apos; s record in multi-state pending cases was also good. \"In cases where there was a type of court or court judgement, California is 10 and 0. Some of these cases may still be on appeal. So, they could still lose,\" he said. \"But, I think if you bring each of these together (suspended and completed cases), that's a lot of winning: really 26 clear wins in these cases, for only three losses.\" Individual California cases such as multistate cases, California has achieved some early success in cases that it independently filed against the Trump administration. The Attorney General's Office described 13 of the 60 lawsuits against the Trump administration as \"cases only for California.\" Among those cited by the Attorney General &apos; s Office, the State achieved two clear wins and one loss, according to a review by Polyte Fact California. Nine of these cases are still pending, while one case seeking conflict of interest documents from the former EPA Director Scott Prewitt was settled with the Environmental Protection Agency, which issues the documents when Prewitt resigned last year without confessing guilt. The U.C. Davis Law School has agreed with Dean Kevin Johnson that California has a successful court record so far. \"I generally think it's a fair statement,\" he says California is \"win.\" \"It's not as easy as saying whether a team won a football game, though. Some of these cases are far from complete. For example, in cases challenging the President &apos; s executive order on the punishment of the asylum authorities and the cancellation of their funding, the case has not yet been concluded.\" The White House did not respond to the request for comment. The Attorney General of California, Javier Pisera, claimed at a press conference in August, \"Every time we go to court,\" against the Trump administration, \"mostly, we win.\" There is a professor of political science, Marquette and Calmaters, a non-profit news organization, who pursues lawsuits separately in California. Their respective records show that the State has won the vast majority of cases that have received at least a preliminary or final judgement. However, this does not mean that California has won \"every time we go to court,\" as Becerra said, even with recognition as \"most often.\" Most cases are still on their way to the courts, and they still have to receive final judgements, some of which may be against California. This important warning is not reflected in Becerra &apos; s claim. However, Becerra makes a more complete statement earlier than the press conference, saying, \"In most of the cases we have submitted, we have so far won the judgements we have received.\" Given this context and California &apos; s early success in court, the Becerra allegation is generally accurate. We assess his claim mostly true. In fact, this statement is accurate but requires further clarification or information.
