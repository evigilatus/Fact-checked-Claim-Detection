Tony Evers\u2019 State of the State address.\nHe celebrated the state\u2019s identity as America\u2019s Dairyland. He bemoaned the loss of family farms in recent years. And he called for a special session of the Legislature to consider a package of agricultural bills.\nAll of which one Republican leader claimed was disingenuous.\n\"Governor Evers\u2019 sudden concern for rural Wisconsin and our agriculture industry is ironic given that just a year ago he proposed raising taxes on the agriculture industry to pay for expanded welfare programs,\" state Rep. John Nygren, chairman of the powerful Joint Finance Committee, said Jan. 22, 2020 on Twitter and in a later news release. \"No amount of rhetoric can cover his failed record of putting rural Wisconsin and our farmer(s) behind liberal special interests.\"\nThe budget claims from the Marinette Republican caught our eye.\u00a0\nDid Evers really try to raise taxes on agriculture to fund welfare?\nAgriculture affected, but not directly\nDefending Nygren\u2019s claim, his chief of staff Nathan Schwanz pointed to proposed changes to the Manufacturing and Agriculture Tax Credit.\nEvers\u2019 budget explicitly changed only half of that credit. He proposed limiting the credit for manufacturing to $300,000 per tax year. But the budget added, \"The Governor also recommends leaving the agricultural portion of the credit unchanged compared to current law.\"\nThe changes would have reduced the tax credit \u2014 i.e. raised taxes \u2014 by a total of $289 million in 2020 and $237 million in 2021.\nSchwanz said the proposed cut still would have been a blow to agriculture, however, pointing to a Legislative Fiscal Bureau memo from February 2019.\nThe nonpartisan agency, responding to a request from Nygren, found about 25% of the manufacturing and agriculture tax credits in 2018-19 went to manufacturers \"where agricultural products are the primary input.\" Those were manufacturers of food, beverages, tobacco and basic chemicals.\nSo Evers didn\u2019t propose any direct tax increases to agriculture, but his proposed changes for manufacturers would have reduced their income.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNygren\u2019s argument is that would have then affected agricultural producers by limiting the amount of product manufacturers took in.\u00a0\nBudget dynamics a factor in claim\nNygren also connected these cuts to welfare.\nEvers\u2019 proposed budget increased spending for welfare programs, so Schwanz said the proposed cuts to the manufacturing and agriculture credit were among the changes needed to offset that.\nHe summed up the logic this way:\n\"There is no doubt that the Governor\u2019s budget increased General Fund taxes. There is no doubt that his budget expanded welfare and that these tax increases were needed to pay for it.\"\nSo there\u2019s no direct link between the manufacturing tax credit and welfare. That is, Evers didn\u2019t propose earmarking the credit savings for a welfare program.\nBut broadly speaking, a cut in one area does affect the ability to increase spending in another. The manufacturing tax credit is paid from the General Fund, which is used for all manner of welfare programs.\nIt\u2019s an approach to budgeting that is used by fiscal bureau analysts and others, including Evers.\nFor example, in his 2017 annual education address, Evers, then the schools superintendent, said, \"Every dollar we shift from the state coffers to pay for roads, and increasingly, to simply pay for debt, is a dollar we move out of the classroom of a child,\" the Wisconsin State Journal reported in a Sept. 22, 2017 article.\nOur ruling\nNygren said the governor proposed raising taxes on the agricultural industry to expand welfare programs.\nIt\u2019s not unreasonable to connect tax changes to welfare programs, since both tie into the General Fund and were part of the same proposed budget. Of course, that budget contained a multitude of other changes as well.\nBut Nygren is off base saying Evers proposed raising taxes on agriculture. Evers explicitly left the agriculture side of a tax credit alone, though some agriculture operations could have been indirectly affected since their products are used by manufacturers.\nThat leaves us with a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.\nWe rate Nygren\u2019s claim Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17393"}
