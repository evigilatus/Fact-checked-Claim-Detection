SOMEONE WAS AT THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME WITH A CAMERA. IT WAS REPORTED THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS FURIOUS THAT HE WAS CAUGHT ON CAMERA AND IT WAS PUBLISHED AND TRIED TO BLOCK IT. The name of the book Obama is holding is called: The Post-American World, and it was written by a fellow Muslim.\u00a0 (Fareed Zakaria) \"Post\" America means: The World \"After\" America! If each person sends this to a minimum of twenty people on their address list, in three days, all people in the United States of America would have the message. I believe this is the one photo that really should be passed around.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThere is no evidence and no credible news reports that supports the claim that President Obama was \"furious\" that the photo was taken. The photographer was a known member of the press and wasn\u2019t secretly \"in the right place at the right time.\".\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBesides authoring several books, Fareed Zakaria hosts the show \"Fareed Zakaria GPS\" for CNN Worldwide, and he is a columnist for the Washington Post and a contributing editor for The Atlantic, according to his website.\u00a0\nWhile Zakaria is Muslim-born, he has said in previous interviews that he does not consider himself a \"religious guy.\" The post also make the false claim that Obama is Muslim when it describes Zakaria as a \"fellow\" Muslim.\nThe characterization of the book is also wrong. \"The Post American World\" is not a Muslim\u2019s perspective on a future world with a toppled America, but is about \"the rise of the rest\" with the growth of countries like China and India.\u00a0\nIn the first chapter, Zakaria writes: \"This is a book not about the decline of America but rather about the rise of everyone else. It is about the great transformation taking place around the world, a transformation that, though often discussed, remains poorly understood.\"\nA Publishers Weekly review of the book called it \"a stimulating, largely optimistic forecast of where the 21st century is heading,\" saying that Zakaria \"predicts that despite its record of recent blunders at home and abroad, America will stay strong, buoyed by a stellar educational system and the influx of young immigrants, who give the U.S. a more youthful demographic than Europe and much of Asia whose workers support an increasing population of unproductive elderly.\"\nThe New York Times Sunday Book Review said the book is \"a relentlessly intelligent book that eschews simple-minded projections from crisis to collapse \u2026 Zakaria\u2019s is not another exercise in declinism. His point is not the demise of Gulliver, but the \u2018rise of the rest.\u2019\"\u00a0\nWe rate this post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16759"}
