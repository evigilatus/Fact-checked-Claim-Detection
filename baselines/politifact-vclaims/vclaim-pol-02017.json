Here's why that's overstated", "text": "Florida House Republicans are playing mythbusters on claims of stagnant school spending.\nThe House Majority Office, which is overseen by Speaker Richard Corcoran, released a five-minute video May 17 that takes aim at teachers\u2019 unions and state educators (and unnamed \"media allies\") who say the 2018-19 education budget isn\u2019t enough to cover the costs of running a school district.\nBack in March, superintendents of some of Florida\u2019s largest districts wrote a column saying, \"The 47 cents per student increase in the base student allocation \u2014 the only funds school districts can use for student programs, teacher salaries and other costs \u2014 will force us to make cuts in critical areas of our operations.\"\nThe House Republicans\u2019 released their video on the same day 35 Democrats called on the Legislature to hold a special session to reconsider education funding for the next school year (a motion that failed).\nIt offers a defense of education spending (using phrases like \"sparsity supplement\" and \"millage compression\") to argue that approved spending is really closer to $100 per student, at least.\n\"Have you heard the \u201847 cents\u2019 myth?\" the Florida House asked in the description of the video. \"The rumor goes \u2018per-student funding only rose by $0.47 this year.\u2019 Nothing could be further from the truth.\"\nThe number isn\u2019t a myth; it just isn\u2019t the number that House Republicans want to highlight as inaccurate.\nHouse leaders and district officials are using two different ways to measure per-student funding, based on different funding sources. There\u2019s some truth to both claims, but using either amount requires more context. Calling one a \"myth\" is too dismissive.\nWhat\u00a0to know about the House Majority argument\nThe House Majority Office argues that per-pupil spending increased by $101, not 47 cents. The $101 figure is accurate if you consider every facet of education funding.\nThe state\u2019s 2018-19 education budget increased public school spending by more than $485 million. In 2017-18, per-pupil funding was $7,307. In 2018-19, it increased slightly to $7,408 per student (an increase of $101.50).\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the $101 increase is an average of what school districts will receive, so the actual amount of per-pupil funding really depends on the county.\nFor example, it\u2019s possible that the largest districts won\u2019t receive all of the $101 after taking into account new state mandates and an expected student decrease. According to the Florida Department of Education documents, total per-pupil funding will\u00a0increase by $65 in Miami-Dade; $52 in Broward County; $73 in Pinellas County; and $85 in Hillsborough County.\nThat said, other counties, particularly smaller ones\u00a0like Calhoun County, will receive $263.\nMore importantly, the $101 increase in student spending includes every source of education funding. Some sources of funding have to be used for specific purposes.\nTo name a few, there\u2019s the Exceptional Student Education allocation reserved for people who are disabled or gifted; the Teacher Classroom Supply Assistance Program, which allows teachers to purchase materials and supplies for the public school students assigned to them; and the digital classroom allocation, which provides money for devices.\nIt also includes the money set aside to hire additional school resource officers and money to increase mental health facilities.\nSo, while it\u2019s accurate to say per-student funding rose by $101, it\u2019s important to know that school districts don\u2019t have a lot of flexibility in how that money can be used.\nThat\u2019s why state educators and unions have used the increase in the base student allocation (47 cents) to demonstrate how little money is left for districts to pay for day-to-day operating costs.\nTracing the origins of 47 cents\nLabeling the 47-cent claim \"a myth\" is misleading. After all, it appears in the Florida Department of Education\u2019s own 2018-19 document about education financing.\nThis amount refers to the budget\u2019s base student allocation, the amount of money allocated for each student. The money is unrestricted, which means districts have the most freedom in how that portion of the education budget is used.\nThe base student allocation is one of the\u00a0only pieces of the budget that goes toward teachers\u2019 salaries and raises, electricity, fuel for buses, health care for faculty and administrators, and other operational costs.\nIn 2017-18, the base student allocation was $4,203.95. In 2018-19, it increased slightly to $4,204.42 per student (an increase of 47 cents, if you haven\u2019t caught on by now).\nThe base student allocation fell during the recession from 2007 to 2012. Funding has increased each year starting in 2012-13, though those year-over-year hikes have been bigger than in this year\u2019s budget.\n\n\n\n\nFiscal year\n\n\nBase Student Allocation\n\n\n\n\n2007-08\n\n\n$4,079.74\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2008-09\n\n\n$3,886.14\n\n\n\n\n2009-10\n\n\n$3,630.62\n\n\n\n\n2010-11\n\n\n$3,623.76\n\n\n\n\n2011-12\n\n\n$3,479.22\n\n\n\n\n2012-13\n\n\n$3,582.98 (+$103)\n\n\n\n\n2013-14\n\n\n$3,752.30 (+$169.32)\n\n\n\n\n2014-15\n\n\n$4,031.77 (+279.47)\n\n\n\n\n2015-16\n\n\n$4,154.45 (+$122.68)\n\n\n\n\n2016-17\n\n\n$4,160.71 (+$6.26)\n\n\n\n\n2017-18\n\n\n$4,203.95 (+$43.24)\n\n\n\n\n2018-19\n\n\n$4,204.42 (+$0.47)\n\n\n\n\nThe 47-cent increase wasn\u2019t always the plan. In January, before the Parkland shooting, the House\u2019s original education budget included increasing the base student allocation by $75.\nSchool districts receive more than just the base student allocation for education-related expenses. But the issue is that a good chunk of the overall funding is tied to specific purposes.\nFor example, more than $161 billion of the $500 million increase is for the safe school allocation and can only be used on certain purposes such as paying for school resource officers. Another good chunk \u2014 $69 million \u2014 has to go toward mental health services.\nIn both of those cases, the money is restricted and can only be used for its intended purpose. So, unlike the base student allocation, it can\u2019t be used on teacher raises.\n\"While money has been poured into special legislative projects such as best and brightest, safe schools and mental health, it is the core funding beginning with the base student allocation that enables districts to do the vast majority of the work they do with students throughout the year,\" said Tracey Pierce, the Duval schools chief of public relations and marketing.\nOur ruling\nThe Florida House Majority Office said that it\u2019s \"a myth\" that per-student funding only rose by 47 cents this year.\nThe claim that per-student funding only rose by 47 cents definitely needs context. But calling it a myth goes too far, as does the Republicans\u2019 claim that per-pupil spending is really closer to $100. Moreover, not every district will get that per-pupil amount.\nAn amount that high is only possible once you factor in all education-related spending. That includes a good chunk of money that has to be spent on specific purposes like school security and mental health. The increase in the base student allocation (47 cents) represents the amount of money left over for flexible spending, which districts can use for student programs, teacher salaries and other operational costs.\nThe office's statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.
