Yes, though he later said it was a joke.\nThe original source of this claim was a tweet Trump sent on Nov. 6, 2012, as we noted in a January 2016 fact-check of a similar claim by Clinton\u2019s Democratic opponent, Bernie Sanders.\nTrump\u2019s tweet said, \"The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.\"\n\nSo Clinton certainly has evidence to support her claim. But we should also note that Trump backed off his claim after Sanders noted them in January on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, calling the Chinese link a \"joke.\"\nOn Jan. 18, after Sanders had attacked Trump\u2019s climate change views in the Democratic debate, Trump told Fox & Friends, \"Well, I think the climate change is just a very, very expensive form of tax. A lot of people are making a lot of money. I know much about climate change. I'd be \u2014 received environmental awards. And I often joke that this is done for the benefit of China. Obviously, I joke. But this is done for the benefit of China, because China does not do anything to help climate change. They burn everything you could burn; they couldn't care less. They have very \u2014 you know, their standards are nothing. But they \u2014 in the meantime, they can undercut us on price. So it's very hard on our business.\"\nTrump may call the mention of China\u2019s role a joke, but he certainly has a lengthy record of using the word \"hoax\" to describe climate change. (For the record, in 2014 we rated the claim that climate change is a \"hoax\" Pants on Fire.)\nOn Dec. 30, 2015, Trump told the crowd at a rally in Hilton Head, S.C., \"Obama's talking about all of this with the global warming and \u2026 a lot of it's a hoax. It's a hoax. I mean, it's a money-making industry, okay? It's a hoax, a lot of it.\"\nThat\u2019s three times using \"hoax\" in one sentence. Trump has also used the word on Twitter since his 2012 tweet.\nOn Jan. 25, 2014, Trump tweeted, \"NBC News just called it the great freeze \u2014 coldest weather in years. Is our country still spending money on the GLOBAL WARMING HOAX?\"\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Jan. 29, 2014, Trump tweeted: \"Snowing in Texas and Louisiana, record setting freezing temperatures throughout the country and beyond. Global warming is an expensive hoax!\"\n\nThat same day, he tweeted, \"Give me clean, beautiful and healthy air - not the same old climate change (global warming) bullshit! I am tired of hearing this nonsense.\"\n\nTrump also called climate change a \"hoax\" on the\u00a0Jan. 6, 2014, edition of Fox & Friends.\nIn addition, he said on the Sept. 24, 2015, edition of CNN\u2019s New Day, \"I don\u2019t believe in climate change.\"\nAnd on Jan. 18, 2016, Trump said that climate change \"is done for the benefit of China, because China does not do anything to help climate change.\"\nWe didn\u2019t find Trump using the word \"hoax\" in the months since our previous fact-check, but he hasn\u2019t backed off his aggressive skepticism of climate change and policies designed to alleviate it. In fact, he\u2019s enshrined opposition to climate change efforts as a key part of his platform.\nIn a high-profile speech on energy policy in North Dakota on May 26, 2016, Trump attacked \"draconian climate rules.\" He advocated rescinding \"all the job-destroying Obama executive actions, including the Climate Action Plan\" and said he would \"cancel the Paris Climate Agreement and stop all payments of U.S. tax dollars to U.N. global warming programs.\"\n\"President Obama entered the United States into the Paris Climate Accords unilaterally and without the permission of Congress,\" Trump said. \"This agreement gives foreign bureaucrats control over how much energy we use right here in America.\"\nOur ruling\nClinton said, \"Donald Trump says climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese.\"\nTrump did tweet that view in 2012, though he made efforts earlier this year to describe that remark as a \"joke.\"\nHowever, Trump has repeatedly called climate change a \"hoax\" in speeches, tweets and media appearances, and while he hasn\u2019t necessarily repeated the charge that China \"invented\" climate change, he has said as recently as Jan. 18, 2016, that action on climate change \"is done for the benefit of China.\"\nWe rate the claim Mostly True.\n Share the Facts   Politifact    2 7  Politifact Rating: Mostly True  Says \"Donald Trump says climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese.\"    Hillary Clinton Democratic presidential candidate   In a national security address Thursday, June 2, 2016 06/02/2016    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04880"}
