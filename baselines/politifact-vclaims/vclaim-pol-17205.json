Mandela Barnes, after police shooting of Jacob Blake, \"did not call for peace. They did not encourage calm.", "truth_label": "barely-true", "date": "stated on August 25, 2020 in News release:", "title": "Claim that Evers, Barnes did not call for peace, calm after Blake shooting goes too far", "text": "The national protests over police brutality that started in Minnesota after a Minneapolis police officer killed George Floyd by kneeling for nearly nine minutes on his neck have now focused squarely on Wisconsin.\nOn Sunday August 23, 2020, a Kenosha police officer shot Jacob Blake in the back multiple times at close range as Blake tried to get into a small SUV. Protests re-ignited across the country, including in Madison and, of course, Kenosha, where buildings were vandalized and burned, windows smashed out and stores looted.\u00a0\nState Sen. Howard Marklein, R-Spring Green, decried the destruction in an August 25, 2020, news release and Facebook post.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"There is absolutely no justification for the vandalism, destruction, rioting and looting that took place at the State Capitol, in the City of Madison or the City of Kenosha last night,\" Marklein posted on Facebook.\nThen he took aim at the state\u2019s Democratic leaders.\n\"We need leadership in this state to take a stand, protect our citizens and call for peace, rather than capitulating to violent mobs. Governor Tony Evers and Lieutenant Governor Mandela Barnes made irresponsible comments about the incident in Kenosha before having all of the facts. They did not call for peace. They did not encourage calm.\"\u00a0\nThe statement came before a night of chaos involving protesters and armed militia members left two men dead and a third man injured. Kyle Rittenhouse, 17, of Antioch, Ill., is charged with shooting the men. Rittenhouse is a self-described militia member.\nWe\u2019ll focus on the last part of Marklein\u2019s claim.\u00a0\nDid Evers and Barnes \"not call for peace\" and \"not encourage calm\" in the wake of the Blake shooting?\nThe evidence\nWhen asked to provide backup for the statement, Katy Prange, Marklein\u2019s chief of staff, focused on the timing and context of statements made by Evers and Barnes.\nLet\u2019s look at the sequence.\n\u00a0Here is the complete August 23, 2020 news release from the governor\u2019s office, hours after the incident:\nMADISON \u2014 Gov. Evers tonight released the following statement regarding the officer-involved shooting that critically injured a Black man in Kenosha.\n\"Tonight, Jacob Blake was shot in the back multiple times, in broad daylight, in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Kathy and I join his family, friends, and neighbors in hoping earnestly that he will not succumb to his injuries. While we do not have all of the details yet, what we know for certain is that he is not the first Black man or person to have been shot or injured or mercilessly killed at the hands of individuals in law enforcement in our state or our country.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe stand with all those who have and continue to demand justice, equity, and accountability for Black lives in our country\u2014lives like those of George Floyd, of Breonna Taylor, Tony Robinson, Dontre Hamilton, Ernest Lacy, and Sylville Smith. And we stand against excessive use of force and immediate escalation when engaging with Black Wisconsinites.\nI have said all along that although we must offer our empathy, equally important is our action. In the coming days, we will demand just that of elected officials in our state who have failed to recognize the racism in our state and our country for far too long.\"\nThere was no call for peace or calm in the statement.\nThe following morning, Evers\u2019s office issued a video message:\u00a0\nIn the video address, neither Evers nor Barnes mentioned the violence or damage from the previous night, but they did ask that those protesting \"do so peacefully.\"\u00a0\nMarklein\u2019s statement was posted on Facebook at 11:06 a.m. the next day, August 25. So, that\u2019s our starting point for the accuracy of the claim.\nWe also looked at Barnes\u2019 tweets and Facebook posts, but did not find any reference to calling for peace or calm prior to Marklein\u2019s post.\nIn a news release later that day, Evers said: \"Tonight, and in the days ahead, if you are going to protest, please do so peacefully and safely. Please do not allow the actions of a few distract us from the work we must do together to demand justice, equity, and accountability.\"\u00a0\nSo, clearly, that statement from Evers -- his strongest on the question of peace and calm -- came after Marklein\u2019s claim.\nBritt Cudaback, Evers\u2019 deputy communications director, argued Evers had called for a peaceful protest the day before Marklein\u2019s claim, citing the video message\nBarnes\u2019 communications director Chet Agni, said Marklein was making \"broad claims.\"\u00a0\n\"Our administration has been calling for people to exercise their First Amendment rights peacefully and safely since before Sen. Marklein released his statement, just as our administration did during the unrest following the murder of George Floyd months ago,\" he said in an email.\nThat said, our research, and the information provided by the offices of Evers and Barnes, shows a single reference to \"peacefully\" before the Marklein statement was made.\nOur ruling\nMarklein claimed that Evers and Barnes, \u00a0after the police shooting of Jacob Blake, \"did not call for peace. They did not encourage calm.\"\nThe governor did not call for peace and calm in his statement hours after the incident. But in a video statement posted the next day, Evers urged people planning to protest to \"do so peacefully.\"\nThat said, his most direct comments -- saying the Kenosha protests went too far -- didn\u2019t come until after Marklein\u2019s statement.\u00a0\nWe rate Marklein\u2019s claim Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17205"}
