Chris Christie recently suggested a winning debate performance this week could propel the Republican presidential candidate to victory in November.\nJust like the 1980 debate took Ronald Reagan from trailing in the polls to winning 40 states on Election Day, the governor said.\nThe New Jersey governor offered that history lesson last week as Romney and President Barack Obama gear up for their first debate Wednesday. Obama has been leading Romney in most national polls.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Ask Ronald Reagan if he were around, you know, who was behind in the polls in 1980 going into the debate with Jimmy Carter and then turned around 10 days later and won 40 states,\" Christie, a Republican, said at a Sept. 24 news conference. \"These debates matter. They\u2019re very important.\"\n\nIt\u2019s true that Reagan won 44 states in the 1980 election, but it\u2019s not entirely accurate for Christie to say Reagan \"was behind in the polls\" going into the debate with Carter.\n\nLeading up to that Oct. 28, 1980 debate -- a week before Election Day -- some polls showed Carter with a slight advantage over Reagan, but other polls had Reagan ahead of the president. Still, given the margins of error attached to the polls, the race appeared too close to call, according to various news articles.\n\nThe governor\u2019s office did not respond to two e-mails seeking comment.\n\nLet\u2019s review some of those poll results.\n\nIn a Gallup poll released the day before the debate, Carter was leading Reagan by three percentage points, 45 percent to 42 percent. That poll was based on a sample of 1,100 registered voters, including 800 likely voters.\n\nAnother poll done for ABC News and released around the same time offered the exact opposite results: Reagan stood at 45 percent and Carter at 42 percent among likely voters.\n\nBut news articles said that because of the margins of error for those two polls, the \"race is essentially even\" and a \"virtual dead heat.\"\n\nAn Associated Press-NBC News poll around the same time showed Reagan with a greater lead over Carter. Among likely voters, 42 percent supported Reagan and 36 percent backed Carter. That poll still had a margin of error of three percent.\n\n\"Generally, comparable results from all these polls fall within the error margins of such surveys, meaning the race is really too close to call,\" the Associated Press wrote.\n\nThe week before the debate, a CBS News/New York Times poll showed Carter leading Reagan, 43 percent to 41 percent among undecided voters. But given that poll\u2019s sampling error, \"Mr. Carter\u2019s lead thus was highly uncertain, and it is quite possible that Mr. Reagan may actually be somewhat ahead,\" according to a New York Times article.\n\nStill, Reagan\u2019s debate performance has been considered a deciding factor in his ultimate victory.\n\n\"It is my contention that there was significant change in presidential preference by the public starting with the Carter/Reagan debate that accelerated through election day,\" Warren J. Mitofsky, a pollster for CBS News, later wrote.\n\nHowever, leading up to Election Day, polls failed to capture the scope of Reagan's landslide win. As Mitofsky noted, all of the major published polls \"seriously understated\" Reagan\u2019s margin of victory over Carter.\n\nIn terms of the popular vote, Reagan received about 51.6 percent, beating Carter\u2019s roughly 41.7 percent. The 1980 presidential race also included Independent candidate John B. Anderson, who received about 6.7 percent of the popular vote.\n\nOur ruling\n\nAt a news conference, Christie claimed Ronald Reagan \"was behind in the polls in 1980 going into the debate with Jimmy Carter and then turned around 10 days later and won 40 states.\"\n\nReagan went on to win 44 states, but it was not necessarily the comeback victory described by Christie. Reagan was behind in some polls and ahead of Carter in others. Given the margins of error for the polls, the race was \"too close to call\" and a \"virtual dead heat,\" articles show.\n\nWe rate the statement Half True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/d6c098aa-df49-433a-b170-7f608ecd3b96\nTo comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10279"}
