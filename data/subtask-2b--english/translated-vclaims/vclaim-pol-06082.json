The former Chief Executive (Hewlett Packard) (Carly Fiorina) sought to highlight this during the first presidential presidential debate. When Trump was asked about his first position in the polls, Fiorina explained that Trump was linked to a project frustration. \"Whatever your problem is, your case, the growing problem you were hoping to solve, the political class has failed you,\" said Fiorena. \"This is a fact, and this is what Donald Trump uses. I would also like to say this only. Since he changed his mind about amnesty, health care and abortion, I would just like to ask, what principles would he rule by?\" In this verification of the truth, we assess whether Trump has changed his mind about abortion. It appears that Fiorina &apos; s staff were certain that, after a day of discussion, this would appear to have posted a page on their campaign website containing supporting information. They cited articles from the Washington Post and the National Journal, which documented Trump's shift from being pro-choice to being pro-life now. To flirt with Trump with a presidential bid, he was recorded at different moments in a few election cycles. In 1999, he appeared on NBC in a meeting with the press, when he was thinking about running a third party. \"I'm very supportive of choice,\" said Trump. \"I hate the concept of abortion. I hate it. I hate everything that stands for it. \"I care when I hear people talk about it.\" When pressure was put on whether to prevent a procedure called \"partial birth\" by the enemies of abortion, Trump said, \"No. I won't. I'm pro-choice in all respects as much as it goes, but I just hate it.\" In his 2000 book \"The America we deserve,\" Trump confirmed his basic position, but he reversed his position on that particular procedure. \"There are some issues that I don't want to say much about. I support women's right to choose, for example, but I am uncomfortable with these procedures. When Tim Rossert asked me about the press interview if I would prevent partial abortion if I was president, my pro-choice instincts led me to refuse. After the presentation, I consulted with two doctors I respected, and having learned more about this procedure, I concluded that I would actually support the ban.\" Therefore, as of 2000, Trump has \"satisfactory instincts.\" \"I am pro-life\" in mid-February 2011, with Trump again feeding speculation that he will run for president, speaking at the annual meeting of the conservative political action committee. In his 14-minute speech, he made this simple announcement: \"I am pro-life.\" A few months later in April, he sat with the political reporter of the Christian Broadcasting Network, who asked him whether he would really stand by his new faith. That's what Trump said: The distinguished fact-finding bloggers wrote on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" By Samantha Butterman \u2022 January 11, 2012: One thing about me, I am a very honorable man. I'm pro-life, but I changed my mind a few years ago. One of the reasons why I'm changing is why a friend of mine, his wife, was pregnant, in this case married. She was pregnant, and... he didn't really want the baby. And he was telling me the story. He's crying as he tells me. They ended up for some reason, amazingly, by luck because they didn't have the right time, they ended up having the baby, and the baby is the eye apple. He said it was the greatest thing that ever happened to him. And here's the kid who's not gonna get into life. I've heard this, and some other stories, and I'm pro-life.\" Therefore, by 2011, Trump refused to have an abortion. These days, he often tells the story of his unplanned boyfriend's child. In a January interview with Mark Halperin of Bloomberg News, Trump explained his position on abortion. Trump said that the only exceptions to the prohibition of abortion were to protect the life of the mother or in cases of incest or rape. But we noted this shift in that short debate: Trump: \"With warnings, mother's life, incest and rape. That's my position. So I'm pro-life, but with warnings. It's a mother's life, very important, incest and rape.\" Halperin: \"This is how a woman says that she is pregnant and not in any of those exceptional categories and that she chooses to have an abortion, if she --\" Trump: \"Less on when, it depends on when. Depends on when.\" Halperin: \"Well let's say early pregnancy.\" Trump: \"Excuse me. If it's not in any of these -- it's pro-life. Learn it's very simple. \"Prosecution of life.\" Trump interrupted Halperin to say, \"That depends on when.\" We contacted the Trump campaign and asked about his intention. We didn't hear a reply. The ruling Fiorina said that Trump changed his mind about abortion, which is true of Trump's own confession. In late 2000, he wrote that he was pro-choice. By 2011, he said he was pro-life. He recently pointed out that he believed that exceptions to maternal life, incest and rape were appropriate. We find some voodoo in its repetition of \"dependent on when,\" but that doesn't change the basic result. We're assessing this claim right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06082"}
