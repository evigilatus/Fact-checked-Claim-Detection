Early voting began in late April.\n\nLeague volunteer Nan Clayton, a former member of Austin\u2019s school board, told us by phone that the debt warning reflects what league members heard in the community, though she said she couldn\u2019t recall precisely who aired the claim.\n\nWe identified a basic methodology that supports the doubling statement, though district officials said a doubling might not occur--or, if it does, the threshold would be crossed no sooner than 2018.\n\nBond opponent Roger Falk of Austin, a member of the Travis County Taxpayers Union, pointed us to figures posted online by the Texas Bond Review Board indicating that as of Aug. 31, 2012, the district owed $750.6 million in outstanding principal with plans to pay $372 million in related interest.\n\nIf voters OK the sought bonds, Falk said, the district\u2019s outstanding principal would more than double.\n\nSchool district officials said it\u2019s not that simple.\n\nBy email, spokesman Antonio Lujan said the district believes its debt load will not double.\n\n\"Yes, it would be the case if the district issued debt all at once for the $892.2 million\" before voters, Lujan wrote, attributing his reply to unidentified financial advisers. \"However, the estimate does not take into account the amount of debt that is retired annually by the district each year. The district uses a layering approach that allows the district to manage its debt load based on its cash-flow needs. For the purposes of estimating the tax impact, the district assumed an aggressive schedule for bond issuance of 5 years with a maximum projected outstanding debt load of $1.5 billion in 2018.\"\n\nLujan added that the bonds, if authorized, might end up being issued over seven to eight years, which also would affect the district\u2019s outstanding debt load. By email, he noted that another $242 million in bonds authorized by voters in 2004 and 2008 also would be issued in the time window.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Tony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeo Lopez, the district\u2019s executive director of finance, elaborated, saying by phone that the district\u2019s approach to financing projects--a mix of short-term commercial paper and occasional bond sales--keeps its debt lower than if it sold bonds alone. The use of short-term loans saves money, he said, with the current interest rate on such paper 0.18 percent. Also, he said, the district makes regular repayments; for instance, the plan is to repay $46.6 million in principal and $30.2 million in interest in August 2013.\n\nThe pace of the proposed bonds being issued would be driven by factors including the speed of construction projects, Lopez said. \"We\u2019re not going to go and issue bonds when we don\u2019t need the money,\" he said.\n\nLopez didn\u2019t quibble, however, when we said it still looks like the prospective district debt of $1.5 billion in 2018 would amount to double the district\u2019s outstanding principal, as of Aug. 31, 2012, of about $750 million.\n\nA financial analyst for the bond review board, Rob Latsha, said by phone that it\u2019s reasonable to make that comparison, though he cautioned that he hadn\u2019t personally confirmed the district\u2019s aired $1.5 billion figure.\n\nLatsha said it\u2019s helpful to keep in mind that a district definitely owes its outstanding principal, while anticipated interest amounts can change depending on how the body pays it off.\n\nLatsha also said it makes sense that the district would build its outstanding principal over several years. It would take the Austin district \"a while to digest this new issuance,\" he said.\n\nIndeed, Latsha said, the district currently plans to have its outstanding principal knocked down to $444 million as of Aug. 31, 2018, though that assumes no debt is issued in the meantime and the district sticking to its current repayment schedule, he said.\n\nLopez, the district official, summed up by email: \"In general we agree with the statement that the debt load would not double, but if it did, that would not occur until 2018, However, it is fair to say that there are a lot of events that have to transpire in order for the 5-year issuance schedule to occur, and there are lot of assumptions about construction spending, property value growth, and facilities needs built into the \u2018peak debt\u2019 year of 2018. Austin ISD may never see $1.5 billion in outstanding principal all at once, due to construction delays, defeasance (early payoff) of existing bonds, shifts in enrollment, etc.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nAccording to the league, opponents of the district\u2019s bond package say voter approval would double the district\u2019s debt load.\n\nThe district\u2019s outstanding principal could total $1.5 billion by 2018, compared with $750 million as of the end of August 2012, though the district says it might take up to three years more. Then again, the district says, the doubling might not even occur depending on construction schedules and repayment/financing terms to be determined as time passes.\n\nDoubling isn\u2019t a certainty. We rate the claim as Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09382"}
