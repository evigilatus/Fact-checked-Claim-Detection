The comments do not change the rating.\u00a0\nSparring over health care during the Nevada Democratic presidential primary debate, former Vice President Joe Biden took issue with former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg\u2019s record on the Affordable Care Act.\n\"From the moment we passed that signature legislation, Mike called it a disgrace,\" Biden said, a claim he repeated another time during the debate.\u00a0\nBloomberg sought to refute that charge, arguing that he defended the law and believed it should be expanded.\nIt was a heated moment. Both candidates are trying to tie themselves to former President Barack Obama, who spearheaded the 2010 legislation. So we decided to dig in.\nWe reached out to both campaigns for comment. The Biden campaign sent a CNN article, which cited a speech Bloomberg gave at the Dartmouth Presidential Lecture in July 2010 \u2014 just a few months after the health care legislation was passed in March. In the speech, Bloomberg called the Affordable Care Act \"a disgrace.\"\u00a0Bloomberg\u2019s campaign directed us to statements he put out in the lead up to the law\u2019s passage, calling for inclusion of a public health insurance option people could buy into.\u00a0\nThe remarks\u00a0\nWe found a video of the speech on YouTube. In the video, Bloomberg was unsparing.\u00a0\n\"We passed a health care bill that does absolutely nothing to fix the big health care problems in this country. It is just a disgrace,\" he said. \"The president, in all fairness, started out by pointing out what the big problems were, but then turned it over to Congress, which didn't pay any attention to any of those big problems and just created another program that's going to cost a lot of money.\"\nThose aren\u2019t standalone remarks. As recently as 2014, Bloomberg called the law \"really dysfunctional\" during a talk he gave at the annual meeting of SIFMA, one of the financial industry\u2019s trade groups.\u00a0\nBoth times, Bloomberg was still a registered Independent \u2014 he didn\u2019t become a Democrat until 2018.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSteve Scalise\n\n\nstated on February 2, 2021 in an interview on Fox News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNow (Biden) is saying that people who came here illegally can jump ahead of other Americans who have been waiting to get the vaccine.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Victoria Knight \u2022 February 8, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that Bloomberg wasn\u2019t espousing a minority view. The ACA\u2019s approval rating was underwater until 2017, according to polling by the Kaiser Family Foundation. (KHN is an editorially independent program of the Foundation.)\nBloomberg\u2019s response\nOn the debate stage, Bloomberg sought distance from those remarks, saying he is a \"fan of Obamacare.\"\n\"I wrote something supporting it either in the New York Post or the Daily News,\" he said.\u00a0\nBloomberg\u2019s campaign pointed us to a 2009 New York Daily News op-ed that called for a public option, along with other statements. But those weren\u2019t his only writings on the law.\u00a0\nA\u00a0March 27, 2017,\u00a0New York Post\u00a0piece, for instance, also talks about the ACA. But it comes years after Bloomberg\u2019s mayorship ended. And while words like \"disgrace\" don\u2019t appear, calling the piece a \"defense\" of the law isn\u2019t entirely fair.\nIn it, Bloomberg noted some key shortcomings \u2014 for instance, the health law left 30 million people uninsured. He also argued in support of some ideas more popular with Republicans, such as high-risk insurance pools, as a way to bring down costs.\n\"It\u2019s regrettable that none of these ideas was seriously considered in the rush to repeal ObamaCare,\" Bloomberg wrote at the time.\nIt is worth noting that Bloomberg\u2019s current health care plan would build on the ACA, largely by increasing subsidies for people buying private insurance on the exchanges, and by installing a Medicare-like public option. (That plan is quite similar to what\u2019s been touted by Biden himself, as well as by candidates like former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg.)\nOur ruling\nBiden said that Bloomberg called the ACA \"a disgrace.\"\nEvidence supports that. And it\u2019s not the only time Bloomberg took issue with the law \u2014 even if it is a core component of his current proposal for health reform.\u00a0\nWe rate this claim True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17425"}
