Jeff Denham (R-Turlock) to Donald Trump\u2019s extremist views on immigration, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee recently claimed: Denham \"has agreed all illegal immigrants should be detained, arrested and deported.\"\nThe statement by the DCCC, the political campaign arm of House Democrats, caught our attention because Denham is considered a moderate on immigration reform within the GOP. He\u2019s rejected hard-line views and even co-sponsored a comprehensive immigration reform package introduced by Democrats.\nHouse\u00a0Democrats have long coveted Denham\u2019s seat, a potential swing district in California\u2019s diverse Central Valley, and they\u2019re targeting him once again this year.\nWe decided to check whether Denham, a three-term incumbent, truly has agreed with this hard-line immigration stance \u2014 either recently or somewhere in his past.\nWe also wondered whether the DCCC distorted Denham\u2019s stance, in an effort to weaken his re-election chances.\nOur research\nThe DCCC\u00a0made its claim in a March 17 press release\u00a0titled \"The Denham and The Donald Line Up Again Against Immigrant Families.\" It includes a photo of the two Republicans\u00a0standing next to each other.\nThe DCCC has labeled Denham \"vulnerable\" to a Democratic challenger. The committee is backing Democrat Michael Eggman, a Central Valley beekeeper. Denham and Eggman will face each other in the June primary election and likely again in November. They squared off in 2014, with Denham defeating Eggman and retaining his heavily Latino district that includes Manteca, Modesto and Turlock.\nWe asked the DCCC for evidence proving Denham has agreed unauthorized immigrants should be rounded up. A spokeswoman pointed to audio from a 2010 Republican primary debate between Denham and other candidates for Congress. She did not provide any more recent evidence.\n\nIn the audio above from the 2010 debate, the immigration question is asked at the 11:55 minute mark. Denham's response is at the 16:15 minute mark.\nDenham\u2019s campaign spokesman did not respond to interview requests.\nDuring the 2010 debate, the candidates are asked: \"Do you believe that anyone who is here (in the United States) right now as an illegal immigrant should be detained, arrested and deported?\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 28, 2021 in a blog\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook tried to \u201cshut down\u201d the campaign to recall California Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Chris Nichols \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDenham, who was serving in the California Legislature at the time, responded: \"The simple answer is: Yes, we\u2019ve got to uphold the laws of our state, the laws of our nation. But as a state senator, one of the calls that I get frequently are those families that came here legally, that are working here legally and somehow lost their immigration status to no fault of their own.\"\nFrom that both-sides-of-the-fence response, it\u2019s a stretch to call Denham an extremist on immigration, said UC San Diego Political Science Professor Gary Jacobson.\n\"It\u2019s not clear what (Denham\u2019s) opinion is from that, really,\" added Jacobson, who studies Congress. He surmised the DCCC \"may have cherry picked\" the statement.\u00a0\n\u2018As far as rounding people up\u2019\nA response from Denham to a question later in that same 2010 debate adds some clarity. He\u2019s asked how the nation should pay for increased immigration enforcement. His answer stops well short of agreeing that \"all illegal immigrants\" should be deported, as the DCCC attributes to him.\n\"First, absolutely, we\u2019ve got to make sure we\u2019ve got a secure border. But as far as rounding people up, again, you\u2019ve got to look at how they came here in the first place,\" Denham said. \"Did they come here illegally? Or did they come here legally and just have their citizenship expire?\"\nJack Pitney, an expert on Republicans in Congress, said the DCCC claim doesn\u2019t sound like something Denham has or would agree with.\u00a0\n\"Nobody\u2019s ever going to mistake Jeff Denham for\u00a0Donald Trump,\" added Pitney, who teaches at Claremont McKenna College.\nOur ruling\u00a0\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee claimed GOP Rep. Jeff Denham \"has agreed all illegal immigrants should be detained, arrested and deported.\"\u00a0\nIt pointed to a response by Denham in a\u00a02010 Republican primary debate, in which the congressman said: \"The simple answer is: Yes, we\u2019ve got to uphold the laws of our state, the laws of our nation.\"\u00a0\nIn this response, Denham makes no effort to explicitly disagree with the moderator\u2019s statement. But it\u2019s a far stretch to say his answer shows Denham wanted to detain, arrest and deport\u00a0all\u00a0unauthorized immigrants.\nA later response from Denham in the same debate shows the congressman believed immigration enforcement should be judicious. He stopped well short of the idea of rounding up all unauthorized immigrants, saying some may be undocumented to no fault of their own.\u00a0\nThe claim by the DCCC \u2014 which is backing Denham\u2019s opponent in the June primary \u2014 contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.\nWe rate it Mostly False.\n\nClick here for\u00a0more\u00a0on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05202"}
