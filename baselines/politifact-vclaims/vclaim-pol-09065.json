The city came in at No. 5 in a 2010 industry analysis of the nation\u2019s 50 most populous cities, and rates have more than doubled since 2001.\n\nNaturally, this leads to some frustration from ratepayers. A couple years back, a group of Portlanders filed a lawsuit asking a Multnomah County judge to declare that the city improperly spent millions of dollars in ratepayer money on projects such as the Rose Festival Foundation headquarters and the Water House in east Portland.\n\nNow the man behind that lawsuit, Kent Craford, is launching another effort to tamp down on increases. He\u2019s formed a group called Portlanders for Water Reform, which aims to get a measure on the 2014 ballot with the goal of wresting oversight of water and sewer utilities from the Portland City Council and giving it to an independently elected board.\n\nThe group explained its motivation in an\u00a0e-mail\u00a0looking for donations on the day it launched the campaign:\n\n\"As you know, Portland water and sewer rates are out of control and sadly they aren\u2019t going to get any better. According to the Portland Water Bureau\u2019s own numbers, water rates will increase 66 percent in the next five years. Portland\u2019s water rates are higher than those in Phoenix, Arizona! This is unacceptable.\n\n\"What is even more unacceptable is the reasoning behind the high rates. All kinds of \u2019pet projects\u2019 unrelated to the core function of the water and sewer bureaus has (sic) been funded in the bureaus\u2019 budgets at the direction of the City Council. Ratepayers have sued the City over these expenditures. By the City\u2019s own account, the projects identified in this lawsuit total over $127 million.\"\n\nThese are excerpts from a e-mail sent to select donors by a fundraising agency on behalf of Portlanders for Water Reform and then published by the Portland Mercury. Craford wouldn\u2019t give The Oregonian a copy but he did confirm the letter\u2019s authenticity.\n\nPolitiFact Oregon couldn\u2019t help wonder whether these pet projects were really the reason for the growing rates. We decided to look into the matter for ourselves.\n\nFirst we spoke with the city attorney\u2019s office to double check that the $127 million cited in the e-mail was accurate. It is. There are two things to keep in mind here, though. That $127 million figure is the high-end estimate. And the bill was wracked up over a time period of between four and 10 years.\n\nThe figure includes line items like the financing of political campaigns, the Portland Loo Project, the Rose Festival Headquarters (which has since been paid through other funds), the Dodge Park master plan, park arborists and the acquisition of Centennial Mills.\n\nNow that all adds up -- and it\u2019s not just the group filing this ballot measure that has been closely watching the spending. So has The Oregonian, both in news articles and editorials. Still, as City Hall reporter Brad Schmidt has been careful to point out in his coverage, these projects are a relative drop in the bucket when shown against overall bureau spending.\n\nTogether, those bureaus spend about $440 million a year while the millions mentioned in the lawsuit have been dispersed over a number of years, at least as far back as 2008 according the lawsuit itself. That means the \"pet projects\" spending -- and folks at the city don\u2019t believe everything in the lawsuit is unrelated to the bureaus\u2019 missions -- accounts for about 7 percent of what the water and environmental services spent over the past four years.\n\nNow, we also spoke with people from each of the bureaus.\n\nDavid Shaff, the Water Bureau\u2019s administrator, pointed out that the bureau is expecting to spend about $300 million alone on federally mandated reservoir changes. \"The Water House or the loo or the Rose Festival headquarters are a tiny fraction of that,\" Shaff said.\n\nSimilarly, over at the Bureau of Environmental Services, which takes care of sewers, money is being spent. Take, for instance, the Big Pipe. That project cost the city $1.4 billion and its debt is still being paid off. What\u2019s more, to keep the city\u2019s century-old system in working order, that bureau plans on spending $139 million over the next five years in one repair program alone.\n\nWe called Craford to get his take on all of this.\n\n\"It's a one page letter,\" he said. \"They need to be quick, they need to get people's attention and conclude with the request \u2026 it's not intended to be a book report.\"\n\nWe understand that, of course, but the way the e-mail reads it\u2019s the pet projects that are driving the increasing water and sewer rates. Certainly, ending those projects would help curb the increases, but that wouldn\u2019t end them -- not by a long shot.\n\n\"Of course these are not the only contributors to rates,\" Craford said. He then cited $300 million worth of spending on reservoirs he doesn\u2019t believe we need -- though that has been mandated by the federal government -- and \"all sorts of projects that are \u2018mission related\u2019 that are unnecessary.\"\n\nIn a letter looking for donations, Portlanders for Water Reform clearly draws a link between the city\u2019s high water and sewer rates and \"all kinds of \u2018pet projects\u2019 unrelated to the core function of the bureaus.\" The e-mail clearly states that those projects are \"the reasoning\" for the high rates, leaving the impression that they\u2019re the main cause, if not the only one.\n\nA closer look reveals they are a relatively small part the rising rates, shadowed by much larger projects.\n\nThe statement contains some element of truth in that these project contribute to increased rates, but it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, particularly larger projects like the $1.4 billion Big Pipe.\n\nWe rate this claim Mostly False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmanda Fritz\n\n\nstated on October 3, 2011 in in campaign literature\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that \"In 2009, I saved ratepayers around $500 million by persuading the Council to pursue a less expensive compliance mechanism if the City is required to treat Bull Run drinking water.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Janie Har \u2022 October 11, 2011", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09065"}
