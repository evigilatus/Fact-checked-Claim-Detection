The program requires developers of new residential projects to either set aside a share of units at below-market rates or pay into a special fund to support less pricey housing elsewhere.\n\"The Affordable Requirements Ordinance \u2014 ARO \u2014 is really challenged because, my understanding is, in the last 12 years, despite the tremendous amounts of money that have gone into it, only 400 family units have been created. Four hundred in 12 years,\" Preckwinkle said. \"Clearly, 400 family units in 12 years does not constitute success.\"\nThe ARO has faced no shortage of criticism from affordable housing advocates who question whether it\u2019s too full of loopholes to be effective.\nThat said, the 400-unit figure tossed out by Preckwinkle sounded exceedingly low. So we decided to check her math.\nHousing built by developers\nThe ARO has gone through several iterations over the years, but today it applies to developers of residential buildings with 10 or more units who want to build downtown or ask the city for zoning changes, land or financial support. Those developers must offer 10 percent of their project's total number of units at below-market rates or, in the alternative, offer fewer than 10 percent but then pay a per-unit fee to compensate for the shortfall.\nDaniel Hertz, a housing expert with the Chicago-based Center for Tax and Budget Accountability, said policies like the ARO can help address racial and economic segregation, but face inherent limitations in producing a large volume of affordable units.\n\"It\u2019s a policy that has the particular advantage of putting affordable units potentially in higher income neighborhoods,\" Hertz said. \"But it\u2019s not ever going to deliver on the scale of the (housing shortage) problem in Chicago or elsewhere.\"\nThat said, Preckwinkle\u2019s claim significantly lowballs the modest number of units in new projects that the ARO has required developers to offer at lower rates.\nThe city\u2019s Department of Planning and Development reports that from 2008 through September 2018, developers agreed to include nearly 800 affordable units in projects that have been built or are still underway.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChris Kennedy\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2018 in an interview with the Chicago Sun-Times\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There was no requirement to put in affordable housing.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Kiannah Sepeda-Miller \u2022 February 6, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we asked the Preckwinkle campaign for the source of her number, a spokesman sent us a letter to the editor in the Chicago Sun-Times from the director of a local housing group who cited an online list of affordable housing developments the city offers as a tool for prospective renters.\nBut Justin Root, the department\u2019s project coordinator for inclusionary housing, told us that list is incomplete. \"It gives you a good idea of what\u2019s available but it\u2019s not necessarily in real time and it\u2019s not necessarily the entire amount of projects that have come online and have had or continue to have units available,\" he said.\nHousing supported by ARO funds\nPreckwinkle\u2019s critique of the ARO\u2019s performance misses the mark in another way as well. Department records show its affordable housing fund has received more than $158 million since the program\u2019s inception in 2003, with much of it coming since 2007. Preckwinkle complained that large sum had created just a handful of units.\nWhat she didn\u2019t explain is that those funds are dispersed to promote affordable housing in a variety of ways beyond what is spent by private developers themselves to offer a share of the units they build at affordable rates.\nFor instance, ARO funds just last year were used to underwrite rental subsidies at more than 1,400 units for residents making less than 30 percent of the area median income, department records show.\nExperts said that while those funds aren\u2019t being spent in ways that diversify housing in pricier parts of town, the other programs they do support are critical to helping the city\u2019s low-income residents access affordable housing.\n\"This program is not the main way that the city creates affordable housing,\" said Rachel Johnston of the Chicago Rehab Network.\nOur ruling\nPreckwinkle said that \"despite the tremendous amounts of money that have gone into it, only 400 family units have been created\" in the last 12 years through Chicago\u2019s Affordable Requirements Ordinance.\nCity records show that developers have either promised or produced nearly 800 units under the ARO to date. That doesn\u2019t go very far toward achieving the program\u2019s aim to create more affordable housing in pricier areas of the city or closing the city\u2019s affordable housing gap, so there\u2019s some truth to Preckwinkle\u2019s broader argument.\nBut her figure of 400 units is far from credible. And her claim also ignores how the millions of dollars in fees collected from developers who opt out of building affordable units under the ordinance support rent subsidies and other affordable housing programs throughout the city.\nWe rate it Mostly False.\n\nMOSTLY FALSE\u00a0\u2013 The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.\nClick here\u00a0for more\u00a0on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.\n Share the Facts 2019-03-18 19:50:39 UTC   PolitiFact    3 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly False  Says that \"despite the tremendous amounts of money that have gone into it, only 400 family (housing) units have been created\" in the last 12 years through Chicago\u2019s Affordable Requirements Ordinance.
