Former Gov. Rick Perry and others pointed to low taxes, light regulations and a pro-business attitude in describing the \"Texas Miracle\" \u2014 a catchphrase that emerged in the Perry era to explain the state\u2019s booming economy.\nWhile Perry has faded from mainstream politics after two failed presidential bids, the principles set forth under the Texas Miracle banner have not. U.S. Rep. Roger Williams, R-Austin, continued that line of reasoning in a tweet last Sunday10/18 that praised the state\u2019s economic fortunes.\n\"Texas is the embodiment of freedom with lower taxes and less regulations than anywhere else in the U.S. \u2014 and because of these principles, we\u2019re home to millions of skilled craftsmen and innovators that strengthen our economy every day,\" Williams wrote.\nIt\u2019s true that state Republicans continue to pride themselves on keeping taxes low and regulations light. But claiming that Texas has fewer regulations and lower taxes than any other state stands on shaky ground.\n\u2018Less regulations\u2019\nMeasuring and ranking states\u2019 regulatory rules has never been straightforward. There are various methods that policy analysts have used to quantify government regulations.\nSome have taken a simplistic approach by counting words or pages in a government\u2019s regulatory code. Take for instance President Donald Trump who, in 2017, stood next to a stack of 180,000 pages meant to represent the federal government\u2019s burdensome regulatory code and his administration\u2019s deregulatory agenda. With 17 million words, Texas ranks as the seventh-most regulated state by simple word count.\nOther measurements narrowly analyze a specific area of regulations, or regulations that pertain to a certain industry group. For instance, the Institute of Justice, a libertarian public interest firm, releases an annual report that measures states\u2019 occupational licensing requirements, where Texas is ranked 10th-least burdensome.\nAnd others take more anecdotal approaches by using public surveys or surveys of industry stakeholders that measure perceptions of a state\u2019s regulatory framework. For instance, Texas ranks around 28th for the number of people who believe that stricter environmental laws and regulations cost too many jobs and hurt the economy, according to a Pew Research Center survey.\nIn any case, Texas has never ranked as having \"less regulations than anywhere else in the U.S.\" as Williams asserts.\n\"The regulatory thicket in Texas is dense,\" said Brandon Rottinghaus, a political science professor at the University of Houston.\n\"Generally speaking, it\u2019s a state that has a lot of regulation because of a sizable health care community, the massive chemical manufacturing industry, and a host of occupational licensing restrictions,\" Rottinghaus said.\nPerhaps the most advanced method for quantifying and ranking states\u2019 entire regulatory framework comes from the Mercatus Center, a free-market think tank associated with George Mason University. In 2019, the Mercatus Center developed State RegData, a tool that uses text analysis and machine learning algorithms to quantify the administrative codes of 46 states and the District of Columbia.\nInstead of looking at word or page counts of state codes, a method that has been criticized as being too simplistic and arbitrary, State RegData counts the number of times a code uses restrictive or directive terminology, words like \"shall,\" \"must,\" \"may not,\" \"required,\" and \"prohibited.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparing state codes this way, Texas ranks as the fifth most regulated state with about 263,000 regulatory restrictions in its text. California topped that list, followed by New York, Ohio and Illinois.\n\"Just on the basis of, is (Williams\u2019) claim true or not, I would say it\u2019s not true, at least by our measure,\" said James Broughel, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center who helped develop State RegData.\nRottinghaus and Broughel agree that there is a positive correlation between the size of a state\u2019s population or economy and the volume of its regulations. Last month, Broughel and the Mercatus Center released a study on the relationship between regulatory volume and population size, which hypothesized that larger economies demand more regulations due to the diversity and size of their industries.\nBut even if calculating states\u2019 regulatory volume per population, Texas would still not rank as the least-regulated state in the U.S. According to Broughel\u2019s calculations, Texas has about nine restrictions for every 1,000 residents, which is the fourth lowest in the U.S. after Michigan, Florida and Arizona.\nCalculating state restrictions per million dollars of gross state product, Texas is the second least restrictive state bested only by California \u2014 Texas Republicans\u2019 favorite heel.\n\u2018Lower taxes\u2019\nWilliams\u2019 other claim, that Texas has \"lower taxes\" than any other state, also is dubious. Texas is one of nine states without an income tax, \"but the overall tax burden is still high,\" said Rottinghaus.\n\"Texas has a bunch of other taxes, like the franchise (business) tax, gas tax, and \u2018sin\u2019 taxes,\" the taxes levied on alcohol, tobacco and gambling, Rottinghaus said. \"These also add up, and in most cases Texas is not ranked the lowest.\"\nAccording to a 2020 report by the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan Washington D.C. think tank, Texas has the fifth lowest overall tax burden per capita, with an average resident paying about 7.6% of their income toward state and local taxes.\nAnother study by the personal finance website WalletHub, found that Texas has the 19th lowest overall tax burden per capita with an average resident paying about 8.2% of their income to property and sales taxes.\nOur ruling\nWilliams said that Texas has \"lower taxes and less regulations than anywhere else in the U.S.\"\nTexas is a big state with a large population and a diverse array of industries that demand a variety of regulations. There are various ways to quantify and compare Texas\u2019 regulatory volume to other states, yet none rank Texas as having the fewest regulations in the U.S. Williams\u2019 office did not respond to multiple inquiries asking how he figured his statement.\nStudies also show that despite having no state income tax, its overall per capita tax burden does not rank as the lowest in the U.S.\nWe rate this claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18768"}
