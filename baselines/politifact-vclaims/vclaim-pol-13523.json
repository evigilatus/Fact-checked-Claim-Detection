Jeff Wentworth says Texas universities don't have bars on campus because it's against the law", "text": "State Sen. Jeff Wentworth, R-San Antonio, played hardball with MSNBC\u2019s Chris Matthews last week, when the pair scuffled over whether suds are allowed on college campuses.\n\nWentworth, discussing his legislation that would allow concealed handguns on college campuses, balked when Matthews wondered whether \"booze and guns\" are a healthy combination.\n\n\"We don\u2019t have bars on campus in Texas,\" Wentworth said on the Feb. 22 segment.\n\nMatthews: \"You don\u2019t?\"\n\nWentworth: \"It\u2019s against the law in Texas. That\u2019s exactly right.\"\n\nMatthews: \"It is?\"\n\nWentworth: \"Yes, sir. No alcohol allowed.\"\n\nWentworth went on to clarify that he was limiting his characterization to public colleges and universities. When Matthews said he knew a lot of colleges that have campus bars, Wentworth said: \"They don\u2019t in Texas. We\u2019re talking about Texas.\"\n\nWe decided to check whether bars and alcohol are allowed on college campuses in Texas.\n\nWhen we asked Wentworth for backup, he pointed us to a section in the state\u2019s Alcoholic Beverage Code about alcohol sales near schools. According to the code, a county commissioners court or the governing body of an incorporated city or town can prohibit the sale of alcoholic beverages within 300 of a private or public school or within 1,000 feet of a public school at the school district\u2019s request.\n\nCarolyn Beck, a spokeswoman for the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission, told us that the code doesn\u2019t specifically define \"public school\" so \"there are some cities that interpret schools to include colleges and universities.\"\n\nThe Alcoholic Beverage Code also cites a section of the Education Code, which requires a school district\u2019s board of trustees to prohibit alcoholic beverages at \"school-related or school-sanctioned activity on or off private property.\"\n\nYet Andy Kesling, a spokesman for the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, told us that the words \"school district\" in the Education Code indicate that the provision is limited to public schools through high school. Debbie Ratcliffe, a spokeswoman for the Texas Education Agency, later agreed that the law does not apply to higher education.\n\nNext, we contacted some Texas universities to gauge whether they have campus bars.\n\nRhonda Weldon, a spokeswoman for the University of Texas at Austin, told us the university\u2019s Texas Union building houses both the Cactus Cafe, which has a liquor license, and the Underground, which is licensed to serve beer and wine. She said other campus venues where alcohol can be served, such as the Frank Erwin Center and the AT&T Executive and Education Conference Center, are run by contractors who are licensed to sell alcohol.\n\nWentworth called UT-Austin an exception. He said too that alcohol was prohibited on campus when he attended the Texas Tech University School of Law. Wentworth earned his law degree there in 1971.\n\nTexas Tech spokesman Chris Cook confirmed that students aren\u2019t allowed to have alcohol on campus and no campus establishments serve alcohol. But, Cook said, alcohol is sold in suites and club areas where university donors often sit in the football stadium and basketball arena, and is available during special events, such as receptions.\n\nNext we tried Wentworth\u2019s undergraduate alma mater, Texas A&M University. Spokesman Jason Cook said: \"We don\u2019t have bars on campus, in the common term, but alcohol is allowed on campus and is served on campus under special circumstances.\" The University Club, a campus dining facility, hosts a happy hour; the 21-and-older crowd can enjoy a $2 scotch or $3 sangria, among drink specials, from 4-7 p.m. Wednesday through Friday, according to A&M\u2019s web page about the club.\n\nCook said too that the Zone Club, an exclusive seating area in the football stadium, serves alcohol. According to A&M\u2019s athletic department\u2019s website, the Club includes a full-service bar.\n\nIn San Marcos,Texas State University spokesman Jayme Blaschke told us that George\u2019s, in the student center, serves beer. When we asked whether George\u2019s is a bar, he said it\u2019s \"an establishment that serves alcohol\" that isn\u2019t a full-service restaurant.\n\nNext, we looked north, learning that The Pub on the University of Texas at Dallas campus serves wine and beer during certain hours Monday through Friday \u2014 with a limit of two drinks per person, according to the university\u2019s website.\n\nJohn Walls, a UT-Dallas spokesman, said the university doesn\u2019t consider The Pub to be a bar because it has a full food menu.\n\nLastly, we looked for a legal definition of a bar. Beck told us that as far as she knows, none exists in state law.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, the online Merriam-Webster dictionary slaps the \"bar\" label on \"a counter at which food or especially alcoholic beverages are served.\"\n\nTime to close our tab. We found two Texas universities that have bars on campus while other schools we contacted routinely serve alcohol in campus facilities.\n\nWentworth\u2019s claim appears to have no legal or on-the-town grounding. It\u2019s not just wrong \u2014 it\u2019s Pants on Fire.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13523"}
