Harry Reid, D-Nev., a longtime ally, and received praise from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., a frequent opponent, over the deal.\nSo where do the leading Democratic presidential candidates stand on the Trans-Pacific Partnership?\nSanders sides with other members of the Senate\u2019s progressive caucus in vehemently opposing the deal. In January 2014, he said he\u2019s against it primarily because it will allow corporations to move jobs overseas.\nClinton\u2019s position on the proposal is complicated by her time as secretary of state, and she\u2019s been careful as a presidential candidate not to express a firm position.\nThere\u2019s evidence to suggest Clinton was deeply involved in the deal\u2019s formation and promotion as the country\u2019s lead diplomat. In 2011, she told a congressional committee that even though the State Department was not in charge of the negotiations, \"we work closely with the U.S. (Trade Representative).\" Leaked diplomatic cables show Clinton\u2019s deputies specifically discussed the TPP with foreign heads of state.\nClinton openly pushed for the deal at least 45 times during her tenure as secretary of state, according to CNN\u2019s tally.\nIn 2012, she touted the trade deal, also called TPP, to a group of American and Australian officials as a way to \"lower trade barriers, raise labor and environmental standards, and drive growth across the region.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut since entering the race for president, Clinton has distanced herself from those remarks.\n\"I did not work on TPP,\" she told reporters in July, saying the deal was \"the responsibility of the United States Trade Representative.\"\nAt times, Clinton has echoed Sanders\u2019 concerns about outsourcing.\n\"Any trade deal has to produce jobs and raise wages and increase prosperity and protect our security,\" she told a reporter from MSNBC in April. \"We have to do our part in making sure we have the capabilities and the skills to be competitive. It's got to be really a partnership between our business, our government, our workforce, the intellectual property that comes out of our universities, and we have to get back to a much more focused effort in my opinion to try to produce those capacities here at home so that we can be competitive in a global economy.\"\nHopeful comments about job creation and increased wages do not signal a clear position on the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\nClinton\u2019s campaign website lists no official position on the deal.\nOur ruling\nThe graphic claims Bernie Sanders opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and Hillary Clinton supports it.\nSanders has said on multiple occasions that he would oppose the trade deal. Clinton supported it as secretary of state, and there\u2019s even evidence to suggest she was an advocate for the deal\u00a0within the Obama administration. But she has taken a neutral stance on the deal during her campaign for the presidency, voicing some of Sanders\u2019 same concerns yet refusing to explicitly criticize the proposal.\nClinton spoke often in support of the Trans-Pacific Partnership \u2014 until that backing irritated parts of her Democratic base.\nWe rate the post\u2019s claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06008"}
