That hasn't happened in 17 years,\" he said on June 25.\nObama\u2019s point is that employers have been spending more and more on health care, so they couldn\u2019t increase wages. Now, he says, health care costs are reined in, which means workers can get more in their paychecks. We wanted to know if Obama was right that this was the first time this has happened since 1998.\nThe White House told us Obama got his numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 Employment Cost Index, which measures changes in employee compensation over time.\nThe data shows that, in the past 17 years, wages grew faster than health care in just one 12-month period, and it was recently: from March 2014 to March 2015. Health care costs grew by 2.5 percent, compared to a\u00a02.6 percent rise in wages.\n\nObama\u2019s claim was specific in looking at the growth in employer health care costs from year to year. Other measures have found similar trends when looking at changes over longer periods of times and employee share of the insurance tab.\nBloomberg, for example, bookended a 25-year period and found that health costs for business almost quadrupled from 1987 to 2012, while wages doubled. According to a report from the health care think tank the Commonwealth Fund, between 2003 and 2013, average family premiums jumped 73 percent, while median family income increased by 16 percent.\nWhile Obama\u2019s numbers are accurate, experts had a few words of caution.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n \n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, it\u2019s too early to tell how big of a role Obamacare played in curbing health care costs. Beyond legislation, experts also count the recession and a slowdown in medical advancements as potential reasons.\n\"I don't think people know the exact relationship between health care costs and Obamacare,\" said Janet Currie, a professor of labor and health economics at Princeton University. \"I think (the claim) is true now. Whether it'll be true next quarter is another matter.\"\nSecond, because wages and health benefits are typically a zero-sum game, Obama\u2019s purported impact on paychecks could go both ways.\n\"Because of the (law\u2019s) increasing binding tax or penalty on the \u2018Cadillac\u2019 insurance plans, some employers may scale back on the generosity of plans and shift compensation towards wages,\" said Jeffrey Clemens, a professor of health economics at the University of California San Diego. Small firms may be pushed the other way, he said:\u00a0\"If their insurance packages fall short, firms in that position would need to increase benefits and maybe take from wages.\"\nThird, less expensive health care isn\u2019t necessarily something to cheer about. It could reflect more bang for your buck and a more efficient system, but if the price reflects the quality of care or access to it, cheaper doesn\u2019t mean better, said Clemens.\nOur ruling\nObama said, \"by one leading measure, what business owners pay out in wages and salaries is now finally growing faster than what they spend on health insurance\" for the first time in 17 years, and he credited the Affordable Care Act.\nHis claim is backed by numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that compare change in costs over a 12-month period: Wages grew faster than health care costs for the first time since 1998 between March 2014 and March 2015. Experts say Obama used the BLS data accurately and reasonably. They did caution that the law's role in this dynamic is still uncertain, and more data may show different results.\nWe rate his claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06250"}
