Only 168 have been revoked. That's 0.006 percent.\"\nTrump\u2019s statement isn\u2019t exactly right because he is only citing a certain category of revocations. A Trump spokeswoman didn\u2019t respond for this fact-check.\nNumber of Florida revocations\nFlorida\u2019s concealed weapon permit program started in 1987. Florida is a \"shall issue\" state, which means it's easier to get a gun permit here than in some other states, and Florida also grants permits to out-of-state residents.\nAs Trump said, 3 million permits had been issued in Florida over the last three decades -- 3.1 million, to be more exact. As of April, about 1.6 million people in Florida currently have the permits.\nBut Trump got his facts wrong about revocations, because he only cited a slice of them.\nBetween October 1987 and April 2016, Florida revoked 10,841 concealed weapon or firearm license permits, according to a summary provided by the state\u2019s division of licensing within the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. The 168 figure that Trump cited is the number of those revoked for misuse of a firearm.\nThere are various reasons that someone can have his or her gun permit revoked, according to state law. That includes permit holders who are convicted of certain crimes including felonies, those convicted of disorderly intoxication three times in a year, those committed to a mental institution, or those who due to physical problems can no longer safely use a gun.\nIn 2011, the state stopped providing a breakdown for the reasons that permits have been revoked and by law now only track the number of revocations.\nWhat experts say about the revocations\nRevocation data alone doesn\u2019t tell the full story about whether nearly all gun permit holders are law-abiding.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharlie Crist\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2010 in a news release\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Speaker Rubio supported gun restrictions that included background checks and waiting periods.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Lee Logan \u2022 February 26, 2010\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2006, the state Legislature made the names of gun permit holders private, making it difficult for the public or journalists to examine whether there are questionable permit holders. That means we found little research about the topic in Florida, and much of it outdated.\nA Sun Sentinel\u00a0investigation of those licensed to carry guns in the first half of 2006 found that permit holders included:\n\n\nMore than 1,400 people who pleaded guilty or no contest to felonies but qualified because of a loophole in the law that allows them to carry guns three years after they complete their sentences if a judge withheld adjudication;\n\n\n216 people with outstanding warrants, including a Tampa pizza delivery man wanted in the fatal shooting of a teenager over a stolen order of chicken wings;\n\n\n28 people with active domestic-violence injunctions against them; and,\n\n\nSix registered sex offenders.\n\n\nThe low number of revocations isn\u2019t a surprise because the applicants had to meet criteria to get the permit in the first place, some experts said.\n\"Revocations are relatively rare largely because the permit-holder population was already \u2018pre-selected\u2019 to be relatively law-abiding by virtue of the requirement that applicants pass a background check to get a permit in the first place,\" said Gary Kleck, a criminologist at Florida State University.\nDaniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy & Research, said that, as a group, concealed-carry permit holders have a below average rate of arrests and convictions.\n\"But the policy question is are Florida and the other states who have made it so easy for nearly anyone to legally carry a loaded gun in public safer as a result? The research indicates that they are not,\" Webster said.\u00a0\"The best-case scenario is that these laws don\u2019t affect violent crime, but the most rigorous research on the subject indicates that when states expand concealed carry of firearms, assaults with guns increase.\"\nOur ruling\nTrump said Florida has \"issued more than 3 million conceal carry permits in the past 30 years. Only 168 have been revoked.\"\nTrump cited the number of permits issued since 1987 but exaggerated how few had been revoked. Florida revoked 10,841 permits, including 168 for misuse of a firearm. We don\u2019t know the full picture about who has a gun permit -- or had it revoked -- because the identities of permit holders in Florida are private.\nWe rate this claim Half True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/b3c0c6f4-ce79-49f2-bba0-8002483e163e", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04887"}
