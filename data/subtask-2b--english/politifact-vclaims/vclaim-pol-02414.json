There is no evidence that Obama is poised to be indicted or that he wiretapped Trump.\nA similar, shorter version of this story appeared on freedomnewscenter.com in September and follows a pattern of fake news stories over the past year that said that Obama wiretapped Trump\u2019s phones during the election. Some photos included a doctored photo of Obama in handcuffs in court.\nOn March 4, 2017, Trump tweeted that Obama ordered surveillance on him during the election.\nAs we explained following his tweets, it\u2019s possible the Trump White House is privy to investigative activities that aren\u2019t in the public record. However, it appeared more likely that Trump took several media reports about legitimate intelligence investigations into his associates\u2019 possible Russia ties and wove them into a new, unsubstantiated theory that Obama himself did something illegal.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on February 8, 2021 in a Newsmax TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOnly one person died on that day\u201d during the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 February 9, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe New York Times and Washington Post reported \u2014 based on anonymous sources \u2014 that FBI Director James Comey asked the Justice Department to publicly refute Trump\u2019s tweets because they wrongly imply the FBI broke the law.\nAdditionally, an Obama spokesman has categorically denied that the Obama White House ordered any wiretapping.\nThe Global Headlines story focused on comments by former CIA analyst and retired Army Lt. Col. Tony Shaffer, who was interviewed following Trump\u2019s tweets. Shaffer, who is frequently interviewed on Fox News and works for the conservative London Center for Policy Research, told Newsweek in 2016 that the incoming Trump administration asked him to apply for a job.\nThe Global Headlines mentioned a \"recent\" interview by Shaffer on the radio show \"Trending Today USA,\" but that interview was actually 11 months ago.\nThe interviewer asked Shaffer if Obama should be arrested:\n\"This could be first time a former president could be indicted for a felony, because I think that it\u2019s very possible that he acted outside the scope of his duties, responsibilities and authorities to turn the resources of a nation\u2019s state on a candidate,\" he said\u00a0in a clip of the interview. \"This is, as I said before, Soviet dictator-level wrongdoing.\"\nThere is no evidence that Obama himself ordered wiretapping to spy on Trump during the election and is now headed toward an indictment. Trump tweeted in 2017 that Obama had ordered surveillance on him. While there have been media reports about intelligence investigations into Trump\u2019s associates\u2019 possible Russia ties, there is no proof that Obama himself ordered wiretapping of Trump.\nWe rate this story False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2b39ee85-d506-4016-b9e3-0204b49c9656", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02414"}
