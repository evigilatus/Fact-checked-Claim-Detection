The raw percentages are eye-popping, but they also mirror a trend that could be seen nationally and in cities around the country.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

His assertion that the national decline in crime \"would be fairly small\" if not for the improvements in New York just isn't true.\n\n\nFrom 1993-2001 -- the time frame the Giuliani campaign uses for its crime stats -- the number of violent crimes nationwide fell by about 25 percent. If you factor out the crimes that occurred in New York during that same period, the nationwide drop would still have been 23 percent.\n\n\nThe difference in the decline for property crimes would have been even smaller.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00317"}
