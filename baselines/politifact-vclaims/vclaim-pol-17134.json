That\u2019s a winning margin for Trump of 10,704 votes.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Gateway Pundit\n\n\nstated on February 5, 2021 in an article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNewly discovered video shows late night deliveries of tens of thousands of illegal ballots 8 hours after deadline.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Clara Hendrickson \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMichigan has 83 counties, of which Clinton won only eight. Trump won as much as 74% of the vote in Missaukee County, about 50 miles southeast of Traverse City, where just 7,000 people voted. For her part, Clinton\u2019s best performance was in Washtenaw County, which includes the university town of Ann Arbor, with almost 68% of the roughly 188,000 votes cast.\nBut on average, dividing 10,704 votes by 4,810 precincts leaves 2.23 votes per precinct.\nAs it happened, each of three third party candidates \u2014 Gary Johnson, Jill Stein, and Darrell L. Castle \u2014 also won more votes than Trump\u2019s margin over Clinton.\nOverall, Obama won 20 counties in Michigan, while Clinton won only eight; she lost 12 counties Barack Obama had won in 2012 while he was winning the state as a whole. A crucial shift came in working-class Macomb County, which Obama won by four points but Trump won by 11. Trump\u2019s margin of victory in Macomb County was easily enough to hand the state to Trump by itself.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nObama said, \"In one of the states that determined the outcome\" of the 2016 presidential race, \"the winning margin averaged out to just two votes per precinct \u2014 two votes.\"\nIn Michigan, Trump\u2019s winning margin averaged out to just over two votes per precinct.
