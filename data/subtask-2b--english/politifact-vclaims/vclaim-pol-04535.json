Because China needs oil. We were driving them both crazy, they formed -- and from the time I was a young guy I always learned, don\u2019t ever let China and Russia get together,\" Trump said. \"We forced them together, Obama forced them together ... because you didn\u2019t get along with either and then eventually China came in and said, \u2018Let\u2019s make a deal on oil.\u2019 They\u2019re together. In fact they\u2019re doing naval exercises together someplace.\"\nFor this fact-check, we\u2019re evaluating Trump\u2019s claim that Russia and China are \"doing naval exercises together,\" and that Obama \"forced them together.\"\nAs neighbors, China and Russia have a complicated relationship. Relations were certainly cold while Russia was part of the Soviet Union, and a small skirmish broke out between the two war powers in 1969.\nThe relationship improved dramatically when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.\nTheir symbiosis since the early 1990s has been largely weapons-related -- with China buying advanced Russian weaponry.\nThe calculation changed in 2014, when Russia seized control of Crimea in Ukraine. The action led to crippling sanctions organized by the United States, European Union and Canada that led a buckling of the Russian economy and a need for Russia to advance its relationship with China.\nJoint naval exercises following the sanctions have \"a new level of seriousness,\" according to Lyle J. Goldstein, associate professor at the U.S. Naval War College in Newport, R.I.. A 2014 exercise in the East China Sea choreographed two submarines and 14 surface ships. A year later in the Black Sea, nine ships practiced anti-submarine warfare.\n\"Russia is trying to prove to the United States, and to the EU as well, that they have other options, that they can go to their other friend and make serious deals,\" said Laicie Heeley, an expert from the Stimson Center, a defense policy think tank.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeremy \"Spike\" Cohen\n\n\nstated on January 22, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays the Biden administration labeled Libertarians terrorists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Czopek \u2022 January 22, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis includes deals on oil, as Trump said. Russia shipped 4.65 million tons of oil to China last March, and such exports have more than doubled over the last five years. This, too, has to do with the sanctions that have limited Russia\u2019s exporting options.\n\"Unfortunately for Russia, the partnership is much more political than economic,\" Heeley said. \"China still represents a rather small portion of their exports, and they haven\u2019t really been able to make the big deals or encourage the private investments that would really help their economy. They haven\u2019t been able to come to the kind of partnership that, rhetorically, they\u2019d like to be able to say they have.\"\nIn July, a tribunal in the Hague issued a rebuke of China, siding with the Philippines in the country\u2019s dispute over territory in the South China Sea. China is salty over the ruling, and diplomatic leaders anticipated some response. But China\u2019s naval drills with Russia are nothing more than fist-shaking, said Heeley.\n\"China is trying to demonstrate that they are a responsible country, and they\u2019re not just going and conducting military drills with Russia to make everyone angry,\" Heeley said. \"This is a measured and careful response by the country. They could be doing something much more to truly anger the international community, but instead they\u2019re not.\"\nOur ruling\nTrump was correct in his claim that Russia and China are \"doing naval exercises together someplace.\"\nHe was right, too, that the countries have increased their oil trading, though not because \"China needs oil,\" as Trump said. It\u2019s more because Russia needs another oil buyer, due to limitations from sanctions.\nFinally, Obama did not single-handedly force Russia and China together. Both the sanctions against Russia and the tribunal\u2019s decision against China are the result of multinational diplomatic efforts.\nWe rate this claim Mostly True.\n\u00a0\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/247efef5-6d83-45b8-86c0-a0b92c358541", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04535"}
