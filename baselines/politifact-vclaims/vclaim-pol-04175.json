Next, you see Hurd, talking on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe, saying: \"A wall absolutely makes sense.\" Text under the snippet says: \"Rep. Hurd Talks Trump\u2019s Idea to Build A Wall.\"\nHold on there. Far as we can tell, Hurd has stopped far short of saluting Trump\u2019s championed border-long wall.\nIn a March 2016 interview with the San Antonio Express-News, Hurd said: \"Building a wall is the most expensive, least effective way to do border security.\"\nWhen we asked Gallego\u2019s campaign for factual backup of the idea that Hurd is aboard with Trump on a border-long wall, campaign spokeswoman Lyndsey Rodriguez initially declared by email that Gallego \"never said that Rep. Hurd backs Trump\u2019s border wall.\" Rather, she wrote, \"our ad states that they share many of the same bad ideas.\"\nBy phone, Rodriguez later said: \"What we are saying in the ad is they both support some form of the wall.\"\nRodriguez also provided a web link to a video excerpt from the MSNBC interview in which Hurd talked about a wall. The 10-second excerpt shows Joe Scarborough, a host of the Morning Joe show, saying: \"Why do they all resort to that?\"\n\"Well, you need a wall in some places, all right,\" Hurd replied. \"In heavily populated places, a wall absolutely makes sense.\"\nWe took our own look at the full Sept. 8, 2015 Morning Joe interview of Hurd, which was pointed out to us by Hunter.\nHeadlined \"Texas congressman refutes Trump\u2019s wall idea,\" MSNBC's five-minute video shows Hurd endorsing a border wall in heavily populated places. But he otherwise was clear about a border-long wall not making sense--meaning Gallego\u2019s ad misrepresented Hurd\u2019s declared view.\nOur transcript below begins with Scarborough asking Hurd about how much of the border with Mexico is in the 23rd Congressional District he represents:\nSCARBOROUGH: \"I want to start with Donald Trump\u2019s wall. So (addressing Hurd) you have, what, 800 miles--\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHURD: \"Over 800 miles--\"\nSCARBOROUGH: \"--bordering Mexico.\"\nHURD: \"Right.\"\nSCARBOROUGH: \"So tell me what you think when you hear Donald Trump and other people talking about building a giant wall.\"\nHURD: \"You can\u2019t build a wall from sea to shining sea, it just doesn\u2019t work. It\u2019s the most expensive way to do border security and it\u2019s the least effective.\"\nA moment later, Hurd said: \"What we need to do is we need to allow the men and women in Border Patrol to adjust their tactics, techniques and procedures as they see fit. You can\u2019t have a one-size-fits-all solution in San Diego. It\u2019s not going to necessarily work in Tucson and you need something different in El Paso.\"\nSCARBOROUGH: \"Right, so why is it, though, that Republican candidates always--remember, John McCain turned to the cameras and said, \u2018Build the dang wall.\u2019 Why do they all resort to that?\"\nHURD: \"Well, you need a wall in some places, all right. In heavily populated places, a wall absolutely makes sense. A wall is just one more tool in your toolkit in order to solve the problem.\" Hurd went on to stress his support for closer collaboration with \"some of our Mexican partners on the other side.\" Hurd also said the U.S. needs to make countering the drug cartels and human smuggling efforts a national priority.\nOur ruling\nIn an ad, Gallego accuses Will Hurd of declaring that a border-long U.S.-Mexico wall \"absolutely makes sense.\"\nIn fact, Hurd has twice spurned Trump\u2019s idea. Still, he told MSNBC a wall makes sense in heavily populated places.\nWe rate Gallego\u2019s claim Mostly False.\n\nMOSTLY FALSE \u2013 The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.
