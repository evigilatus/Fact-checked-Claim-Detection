Indeed, the annual cost of free tax credits alone paid to illegal immigrants quadrupled to $4.2 billion in 2011.\"\nThe $4.2 billion figure caught our eye. Though Trump\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t get back to us, we found a 2011 audit by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration that corroborates his claim. Nonetheless, Trump confuses a few points.\nIn 2009 (not, as Trump says, in 2011), \"individuals who are not authorized to work in the United States were paid $4.2 billion in refundable credits, according to the report. That\u2019s indeed more than four times the amount in 2005 ($924 million).\nHow did this happen?\nAlthough undocumented immigrants can\u2019t get a Social Security Number, they can file taxes with a different nine-digit number, the Individual Taxpayer Identification Number or ITIN.\nExperts told us that illegal immigrants make up the vast majority of ITIN filers, though there\u2019s no way of knowing just how many. The group also includes legal immigrants (refugees, asylum seekers, spouses), foreign workers (professors, technology workers, people who own businesses in America but live abroad), and dependents of both citizens and immigrants.\nRegardless of immigration status, ITIN filers are not eligible for Social Security. According to the Social Security Administration, undocumented immigrants doled out an estimated $12 billion in payroll taxes but will never get the benefits. Also, ITIN filers can\u2019t get the Earned Income Tax Credit, due to a provision in a 1996 law.\nITIN filers, however, can receive the Additional Child Tax Credit, a refund given to people who owed less in taxes than deductions they could receive through the Child Tax Credit (up to $1,000 per child).\nThe credit as it stands today was established in the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, one of the tax cuts passed under President George W. Bush. Unlike in 1996, Congress did not write a provision barring ITIN filers from claiming the refund.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a result, claims for the additional child credit have increased significantly since 2001, according to the Treasury Inspector General audit. By 2009, 2.3 million ITIN filers received $4.2 billion through the additional child credit, a four-fold increase over\u00a02005. Here\u2019s a chart from the audit:\n\nUnder this current system for ITIN filers, \"the government isn\u2019t losing out,\" according to Bob Greenstein, president of\u00a0the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. It gets more money in revenues than it gives out in credits.\nHowever, Greenstein told us it\u2019s slightly misleading to say that the recipients of the child credit are illegal immigrants.\n\"The vast majority of that $4.2 billion, the filer may be undocumented, but you have to have a child to receive it. And the children are overwhelmingly U.S. citizens,\" he said.\nIn other words, the $4.2 billion in tax credits largely benefits American-born children, whose parents are admittedly undocumented immigrants.\nTrump\u2019s immigration plan actually addresses this potential issue: He calls for an end to birthright citizenship.\n\"So his position is pretty consistent,\" pointed out Greenstein.\nOur ruling\nTrump said, \"The annual cost of free tax credits alone paid to illegal immigrants quadrupled to $4.2 billion in 2011.\"\nBased on an audit by the Treasury Inspector General, the claim leaves out some context.\u00a0Trump conflates \"illegal immigrants\" with \"unauthorized workers,\" a group composed largely of undocumented immigrants but also legal immigrants and others. The $4.2 billion refers to the amount given in tax credit refunds for children, the large majority of whom are U.S. citizens. And the actual year is 2009, not 2011 (that was the year the report was published).\nAlso, it's important to note that illegal immigrants pay\u00a0an estimated\u00a0$12 billion in payroll taxes\u00a0to Social Security and don't receive benefits. So Trump is leaving out a significant part of the picture when it comes to taxes and undocumented workers.\u00a0\nOverall, we rate his claim Half\u00a0True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06064"}
