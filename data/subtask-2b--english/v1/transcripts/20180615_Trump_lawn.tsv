0001	Steve Doocy	You've got some excitement out on your lawn today.
0002	Steve Doocy	Hello, Mr. President.
0003	Donald Trump	A little excitement.
0004	Steve Doocy	What brings you here?
0005	Donald Trump	Are we on already?
0006	Steve Doocy	We're on.
0007	Steve Doocy	We're live.
0008	Donald Trump	Wow, wow.
0009	Donald Trump	That's good.
0010	Steve Doocy	We're actually  we're on every channel.
0011	Donald Trump	We had a very exciting trip over here, I have to say.
0012	Steve Doocy	No kidding.
0013	Donald Trump	I was good.
0014	Donald Trump	It was good.
0015	Donald Trump	How are you?
0016	Steve Doocy	I'm doing OK.
0017	Steve Doocy	I was here for the baseball game.
0018	Steve Doocy	How about Steve Scalise last night?
0019	Donald Trump	I think he's great.
0020	Donald Trump	How about that play?
0021	Donald Trump	The first play of the game.
0022	Steve Doocy	Unbelievable.
0023	Donald Trump	He's a great guy.
0024	Donald Trump	Courageous.
0025	Steve Doocy	He couldn't...
0026	Donald Trump	Courageous.
0027	Steve Doocy	Right.
0028	Donald Trump	Like you.
0029	Steve Doocy	Yes, sure.
0030	Steve Doocy	Having you stop by live.
0031	Steve Doocy	I got some questions.
0032	Donald Trump	I was mugged by the media.
0033	Steve Doocy	They've got questions for you.
0034	Steve Doocy	I'm hoping I can ask a lot of the questions.
0035	Steve Doocy	They've got...
0036	Donald Trump	Very nice people.
0037	Steve Doocy	You know, the I.G.
0038	Steve Doocy	report came out yesterday.
0039	Steve Doocy	The FBI looked bad.
0040	Donald Trump	Very bad.
0041	Steve Doocy	Your FBI.
0042	Donald Trump	Well, no.
0043	Donald Trump	It was Comey having to do  talking about Comey, not my FBI.
0044	Donald Trump	It was Comey.
0045	Donald Trump	The people in the FBI are incredible.
0046	Donald Trump	I would bet if you took a poll in the FBI, I would win that poll by more than anybody's ever won a poll.
0047	Donald Trump	But the top people were horrible.
0048	Donald Trump	You look at what happened They were plotting against my election.
0049	Donald Trump	Probably has never happened like that in terms of intelligence, in terms of anything else.
0050	Donald Trump	But they were actually plotting against my election.
0051	Steve Doocy	The headline right now...
0052	Donald Trump	I'm actually proud, because I beat the Clinton dynasty...
0053	Steve Doocy	Right.
0054	Donald Trump	...I beat Bush dynasty, and now I guess hopefully I'm in the process of beating very dishonest intelligence.
0055	Donald Trump	Because what they did was incredible and a real insult to millions of people that voted in that election on both sides.
0056	Steve Doocy	The headline right now from the Wall Street Journal, "DOJ Clinton Report Blasts Comey And Agents But Finds No Bias In Conclusion."
0057	Donald Trump	Well, the end result was wrong.
0058	Donald Trump	I mean, there was total bias.
0059	Donald Trump	I mean, when you look at Peter Strzok and what he said about me, when you look at Comey all his moves.
0060	Donald Trump	So I guess  you know it's interesting it was a pretty good report, and then I say that the I.G.
0061	Donald Trump	blew it at the very end with that statement, because when you read the report it was almost like Comey.
0062	Donald Trump	He goes point after point about how guilty Hillary is and then he said, "But we're not going to do anything about it."
0063	Donald Trump	The report  the I.G.
0064	Donald Trump	report was a horror show.
0065	Donald Trump	I thought that one sentence of conclusion was ridiculous.
0066	Steve Doocy	What about, apparently, the love birds talking about you, "We will stop it"?
0067	Donald Trump	Yeah, they said they will stop me.
0068	Donald Trump	While in the meantime the economy hit an alltime high this morning.
0069	Donald Trump	Never been better.
0070	Donald Trump	Jobless rate the lowest  the best in 44 years, just came out.
0071	Donald Trump	We're going to have some incredible things.
0072	Donald Trump	We're just announcing very big tariffs today on China because China has been  look he's my friend, President Xi.
0073	Donald Trump	He's a great man.
0074	Donald Trump	He's a wonderful guy.
0075	Donald Trump	But at some point we have to straighten it out.
0076	Donald Trump	We lost $500 billion in trade deficits last year.
0077	Donald Trump	We can't do that.
0078	Steve Doocy	Is the new tariff something like 25 percent on...
0079	Donald Trump	It's being announced right now as I speak.
0080	Steve Doocy	OK. You can announce it.
0081	Donald Trump	Maybe you have the first announcement.
0082	Donald Trump	You may...
0083	Steve Doocy	What do you know about your tariffs?
0084	Donald Trump	You might beat the Wall Street Journal, all right.
0085	Donald Trump	You just beat the Wall Street Journal by a lot.
0086	Donald Trump	Well, we're just going to do $50 billion on $50 billion of hightechnology equipment and other things coming into the country, because so much of our secrets  you know, we have the great brain power in Silicon Valley, and China and others steal those secrets.
0087	Donald Trump	And we're going protect those secrets.
0088	Donald Trump	Those are crown jewels for this country.
0089	Donald Trump	And, you know, you read so much about China, you read so much about other countries, we have the great brainpower right in this country, I'm proud to say.
0090	Donald Trump	And you're certainly a member of that group.
0091	Steve Doocy	I'm an America.
0092	Steve Doocy	What about the fact that there are a lot of people that say, "What's he doing?
0093	Steve Doocy	He's going to start a trade war?
0094	Steve Doocy	If he slaps 25 percent on $50 billion for China that's going to be bad for Americans"?
0095	Donald Trump	No, the trade war was started many years ago by them and the United States lost.
0096	Donald Trump	There's no trade war...
0097	Steve Doocy	So you're saying we're on the losing end of it?
0098	Donald Trump	Well, no.
0099	Donald Trump	There is no trade war.
0100	Donald Trump	They've taken so much.
0101	Donald Trump	So last year $375 billion in trade deficit.
0102	Donald Trump	We had a 300  with China.
0103	Donald Trump	We had overall over $800 billion over a period of years  each year close to $800 billion in losses on trade.
0104	Donald Trump	Not going to happen anymore.
0105	Donald Trump	It's not going to happen.
0106	Donald Trump	Can't happen.
0107	Steve Doocy	A week ago you were up in  up in Canada and you met with the G7 people.
0108	Donald Trump	I was.
0109	Steve Doocy	That didn't end so well.
0110	Donald Trump	Oh, it ended well.
0111	Donald Trump	For the United States, it ended well.
0112	Steve Doocy	Well, the world community thinks the United States is turning our back on them.
0113	Donald Trump	No, no.
0114	Steve Doocy	But your opinion is that it's you got elected to represent America and America needs help.
0115	Donald Trump	We need protection.
0116	Donald Trump	Everybody's taking advantage of us.
0117	Donald Trump	The European Union made $151 billion on us last year.
0118	Donald Trump	The  if you look at  I told you about China.
0119	Donald Trump	You look at Japan, you look at South Korea, you look at so many  and we help these countries militarily on top of everything else.
0120	Donald Trump	I mean, you know, at what point does it stop?
0121	Donald Trump	And when I left China, it was absolutely a fantastic meeting.
0122	Donald Trump	We left, we hugged, we kissed.
0123	Donald Trump	Everybody was leaving, and then I get onto Air Force One and the prime minister up there, Trudeau, didn't think, I guess, that we have any televisions on Air Force One.
0124	Donald Trump	But they have, I think, 21 televisions or some ridiculous number...
0125	Steve Doocy	And so, you saw it and you hit the roof.
0126	Donald Trump	Well, you have to understand, we're hugging, we're saying goodbye, everybody's happy.
0127	Donald Trump	I made changes to the agreement because I wanted it to be much better for the United States.
0128	Donald Trump	I made changes.
0129	Donald Trump	We're all happy.
0130	Donald Trump	And then he got up and started saying that he doesn't want to be pushed around by the United States.
0131	Donald Trump	Well, they charge us almost 300 percent on dairy products.
0132	Steve Doocy	Right.
0133	Donald Trump	So, we can't do that.
0134	Steve Doocy	Have you heard from any of the G7...
0135	Donald Trump	Yeah.
0136	Donald Trump	They all called me to wish me happy birthday yesterday.
0137	Steve Doocy	Really?
0138	Steve Doocy	And how was that?
0139	Donald Trump	It was very...
0140	Steve Doocy	Not your birthday, but the message from the other side.
0141	Donald Trump	I took it very well.
0142	Steve Doocy	Right.
0143	Donald Trump	No, they all called.
0144	Donald Trump	I mean, I have great friendships.
0145	Donald Trump	The new prime minister of Italy is great.
0146	Donald Trump	Got to meet him.
0147	Donald Trump	Very  very strong on immigration...
0148	Steve Doocy	Right.
0149	Donald Trump	...like I am, by the way.
0150	Donald Trump	It seems that strong on immigration wins now.
0151	Steve Doocy	Sure.
0152	Steve Doocy	But this is...
0153	Donald Trump	But the Democrats, by the way, are very weak on immigration.
0154	Donald Trump	If you notice when I came over, they were all saying about separating the families and that's a Democrat bill.
0155	Donald Trump	That's Democrats wanting to do that, and they could solve it very easily by getting together.
0156	Donald Trump	But they think it's a good election point.
0157	Donald Trump	I think it's a horrible election point for them.
0158	Steve Doocy	Ultimately Congress has got to change the laws...
0159	Donald Trump	They got to change the law.
0160	Steve Doocy	...but at the same time, Mr. President, people say, "Look, you rip these families apart.
0161	Steve Doocy	Even though it is the law, it's heartless."
0162	Donald Trump	But that's the law.
0163	Donald Trump	And that's what the Democrats gave us.
0164	Donald Trump	And we're willing to change it today if they want to get in and negotiate, but the just don't want to negotiate.
0165	Donald Trump	They're afraid of  they're afraid of security for our country.
0166	Donald Trump	They're afraid of a wall.
0167	Donald Trump	Although I must tell you, most people now really  they want the wall, they want to stop the drugs, they want to stop a lot of people from coming in that shouldn't be here, like MS13.
0168	Steve Doocy	Right.
0169	Steve Doocy	A lot of  I was up on Capitol Hill yesterday with Steve Scalise.
0170	Steve Doocy	They were having a leadership meeting.
0171	Steve Doocy	It sounds like they were going to take a vote on a couple of different bills on immigration probably next week.
0172	Donald Trump	Yeah.
0173	Steve Doocy	One of them the Goodlatte bill, the other is something more moderate.
0174	Steve Doocy	Would you sign either one of those?
0175	Donald Trump	I'm looking at both of them.
0176	Donald Trump	I certainly wouldn't sign the more moderate one.
0177	Steve Doocy	What does the bill have to have in it?
0178	Donald Trump	I  I need a bill that gives this country tremendous border security.
0179	Donald Trump	I have to have that.
0180	Donald Trump	We have to get rid of catchandrelease.
0181	Steve Doocy	Got to have the wall?
0182	Steve Doocy	Does that mean the wall?
0183	Donald Trump	We have to have the wall.
0184	Donald Trump	If we don't have the wall, there's no bill.
0185	Donald Trump	We have to have catchandrelease.
0186	Donald Trump	We catch a criminal, a real criminal, a rough tough criminal, we take his name and then we release him.
0187	Donald Trump	And we say, "Please show up to court in a couple of months."
0188	Donald Trump	You know what the chances of getting him to court are?
0189	Donald Trump	Like zero.
0190	Donald Trump	OK.
0191	Donald Trump	It's crazy.
0192	Donald Trump	Then we have the lottery program, right?
0193	Donald Trump	It's called lottervisery.
0194	Steve Doocy	Diversity Lottery Program.
0195	Donald Trump	Yes, well, the lottery visa.
0196	Steve Doocy	OK. One of the...
0197	Donald Trump	OK, whatever.
0198	Donald Trump	They have fifty names.
0199	Donald Trump	Still  everyone of them has lottery.
0200	Donald Trump	Do you know what lottery is?
0201	Donald Trump	That's when you pick names to come into the country.
0202	Donald Trump	Well, when a country gives names, they're not giving us their finest.
0203	Donald Trump	So we're picking people, it's not good.
0204	Donald Trump	We have to end that.
0205	Donald Trump	We have to end a couple of them and we are going to be so secure as a country.
0206	Donald Trump	Now, with all of that being said, we're doing a great job.
0207	Donald Trump	ICE  we're getting MS13 out by the thousands.
0208	Donald Trump	But we shouldn't have to be going into towns in Long Island and other places and getting them out.
0209	Donald Trump	You know, it's almost like we're liberating towns.
0210	Donald Trump	It's incredible.
0211	Steve Doocy	You mentioned court.
0212	Steve Doocy	Regarding a legal proceeding, you got Robert  the  the Mueller investigation.
0213	Steve Doocy	I know we, kind of, touched on that a little while ago.
0214	Steve Doocy	Rudy Giuliani is out this morning.
0215	Steve Doocy	He said the investigation should go away.
0216	Steve Doocy	Time to fold up the tent.
0217	Steve Doocy	Or it's time to investigate the investigators.
0218	Steve Doocy	Are you on the same page...
0219	Donald Trump	Look, we have 13 angry Democrats.
0220	Donald Trump	There are  I call them 13 angry Democrats, and others worked for Obama for eight years.
0221	Donald Trump	I mean, they have no Republicans, you have no  it's a very unfair situation.
0222	Donald Trump	But the I.G.
0223	Donald Trump	report totally exonerates  I mean, if you look at the results and if you look at the head investigator is saying, "We have to stop Trump from becoming president," well, Trump became president and we have the best economy today we've ever had.
0224	Steve Doocy	Right.
0225	Donald Trump	We have much greater border security than we ever would have had.
0226	Steve Doocy	Right.
0227	Donald Trump	And when we do it  when we have the laws changed, it'll be like perfecto.
0228	Steve Doocy	Rudy says that you should not talk to a lawyer.
0229	Donald Trump	A lot of people say that.
0230	Donald Trump	Look...
0231	Steve Doocy	Getting the I.G.
0232	Steve Doocy	report and stuff that's going on.
0233	Donald Trump	They're getting people who say something a little bit off.
0234	Donald Trump	Is it a nice day?
0235	Donald Trump	Well, you know, no, it's not a great day.
0236	Donald Trump	Oops, you lied.
0237	Donald Trump	He goes  you know, got problems.
0238	Steve Doocy	What...
0239	Donald Trump	People are afraid of that.
0240	Donald Trump	And I would like to talk, but it seems to be very biased.
0241	Steve Doocy	One of  some of the texts  and we're not going to quote them  were very...
0242	Donald Trump	Vicious.
0243	Steve Doocy	...vicious regarding people who support you.
0244	Donald Trump	Vicious.
0245	Donald Trump	I have the greatest supporters in the world.
0246	Donald Trump	By the way, they're the smartest.
0247	Donald Trump	They're the hardest working.
0248	Donald Trump	They pay taxes.
0249	Donald Trump	They're incredible.
0250	Donald Trump	They're loyal.
0251	Donald Trump	I have the bikers.
0252	Donald Trump	I have the  the construction workers.
0253	Steve Doocy	Right.
0254	Donald Trump	I have them all.
0255	Donald Trump	I have  by the way, I have the FBI.
0256	Donald Trump	You go into the FBI and take a poll of the real FBI, not the scum on top, not Comey and that group of people that are total thieves...
0257	Steve Doocy	Most of those are gone.
0258	Donald Trump	Well, I don't know how Peter Strzok is still working there, to be honest with you, OK.
0259	Steve Doocy	He's working in H.R.
0260	Steve Doocy	This is...
0261	Donald Trump	That's even worse.
0262	Steve Doocy	Mr. President, this is your FBI.
0263	Donald Trump	I know.
0264	Donald Trump	But do you know what I've done?
0265	Donald Trump	And you know this.
0266	Donald Trump	I've told you this.
0267	Donald Trump	I'm so involved.
0268	Donald Trump	Great new secretary of state.
0269	Steve Doocy	Right.
0270	Donald Trump	Just  I have a fantastic relationship now with North Korea.
0271	Donald Trump	You know, there were missiles being thrown about.
0272	Steve Doocy	Yeah.
0273	Donald Trump	People aren't thinking about it anymore.
0274	Donald Trump	I said on the Department of Justice, I would stay uninvolved.
0275	Donald Trump	Now, I may get involved at some point if it gets worse.
0276	Donald Trump	I say I'm staying uninvolved.
0277	Donald Trump	I'm letting this report go through.
0278	Donald Trump	I did nothing wrong.
0279	Donald Trump	There was no collusion.
0280	Donald Trump	There was no obstruction.
0281	Donald Trump	There was no one...
0282	Steve Doocy	But, Mr. President, I was on Capitol Hill yesterday, and there are a number of congressional Republicans who are  you know, they're trying to get some documents from your Department of Justice, your FBI.
0283	Donald Trump	I tried to stay involved.
0284	Donald Trump	I may not stay involved, again  uninvolved.
0285	Donald Trump	Because they have to get the documents.
0286	Donald Trump	Look, I think everybody...
0287	Steve Doocy	But your FBI is stonewalling.
0288	Donald Trump	I think that Road  Rog...
0289	Steve Doocy	Rosenstein.
0290	Donald Trump	...Rosenstein thinks that you have to get the documents.
0291	Donald Trump	I really believe that.
0292	Donald Trump	I saw him yesterday.
0293	Donald Trump	He gave me a briefing.
0294	Donald Trump	It think that he believes you have to get the documents.
0295	Steve Doocy	What did he say regarding the I.G.
0296	Steve Doocy	report?
0297	Donald Trump	Well, he wasn't thrilled about it.
0298	Donald Trump	I mean, you know, you can't be if you're in there now.
0299	Donald Trump	But it really was talking about the past.
0300	Donald Trump	It's not talking about us.
0301	Donald Trump	It's talking about before us.
0302	Donald Trump	And it's talking about the election.
0303	Donald Trump	What they did during the election was a disgrace.
0304	Donald Trump	It's probably never happened in our country before.
0305	Donald Trump	And that's just the tip of the iceberg.
0306	Donald Trump	What's going to happen when we go further?
0307	Donald Trump	And there was total bias.
0308	Donald Trump	I mean, total bias.
0309	Steve Doocy	From what you've seen so far, should James Comey be locked up?
0310	Donald Trump	Well, look, I would never want to get involved in that.
0311	Donald Trump	Certainly he  they just seem like very criminal acts to me.
0312	Donald Trump	What he did was criminal.
0313	Donald Trump	What he did was a terrible thing to people.
0314	Donald Trump	What he did was so bad in terms of our Constitution, in terms of the wellbeing of our country.
0315	Donald Trump	What he did was horrible.
0316	Donald Trump	Should he be locked up?
0317	Donald Trump	Let somebody make a determination.
0318	Donald Trump	Look at all the dishonest things that crooked Hillary did.
0319	Donald Trump	Look at  look at what  what's gone on.
0320	Donald Trump	It's very sad.
0321	Steve Doocy	Sounds like he was using a private email, too.
0322	Donald Trump	He had a private email.
0323	Donald Trump	That was  of all the things, that wasn't to me maybe the most interesting, but it was probably the funniest.
0324	Steve Doocy	Because she got in big trouble for her private email.
0325	Steve Doocy	Oh, James Comey's using one, too.
0326	Donald Trump	That was a little bit of a surprise, I have to say.
0327	Steve Doocy	Yeah.
0328	Steve Doocy	From what we've seen, though, regarding the I.G.
0329	Steve Doocy	report, it  it sounds like Comey made some bad judgments but nothing criminal.
0330	Donald Trump	Well, if you look at what happened  and don't forget all of these people like Strzok, what he did was criminal, Strzok and so many others.
0331	Donald Trump	McCabe is now...
0332	Steve Doocy	Do you mean biased the analysts?
0333	Donald Trump	Oh, they all work for Comey.
0334	Donald Trump	And Comey knew everything that was going on.
0335	Donald Trump	You think McCabe didn't tell him everything?
0336	Donald Trump	McCabe told him everything, and McCabe is up for criminal right now.
0337	Donald Trump	And most people...
0338	Steve Doocy	And now he's suing the Department of Justice.
0339	Donald Trump	And he's now suing.
0340	Donald Trump	And it's a total mess.
0341	Donald Trump	They're all going against each other.
0342	Donald Trump	No, I  I think Comey was the ringleader of this whole, you know, den of thieves.
0343	Donald Trump	It was a den of thieves.
0344	Steve Doocy	Are you confident that, either through the congressional investigators or the I.G.
0345	Steve Doocy	report or new management at the  at the FBI, things are going to work out..
0346	Donald Trump	I think so.
0347	Donald Trump	I think so.
0348	Steve Doocy	...things are cleaning up and we'll get to the bottom of all that stuff?
0349	Donald Trump	I do believe so.
0350	Donald Trump	I think its happening.
0351	Donald Trump	It's happening slowly, but it's happening.
0352	Donald Trump	I think Christopher Wray's a  very different from Comey.
0353	Donald Trump	Which is what you need, you need different.
0354	Donald Trump	You need, like, the opposite.
0355	Donald Trump	And he's moving step by step.
0356	Donald Trump	And you're going to see a whole new, very proud FBI.
0357	Donald Trump	I think that the Justice Department will end up being great.
0358	Donald Trump	It's all going to happen.
0359	Donald Trump	It's all going to work out.
0360	Donald Trump	But I tried to stay as much uninvolved as I can.
0361	Steve Doocy	You were very involved in going to Singapore, negotiating with Kim Jongun.
0362	Donald Trump	Right.
0363	Steve Doocy	When you finally met him and sat across the table from  you know, we've heard a lot of bad things about little rocket man.
0364	Steve Doocy	And suddenly you guys seem to be best friends.
0365	Donald Trump	We got along very well.
0366	Donald Trump	We had a good chemistry.
0367	Donald Trump	I don't know if that's supposed to be popular or politically correct to say.
0368	Donald Trump	But we really did.
0369	Donald Trump	We had good chemistry.
0370	Donald Trump	You haven't had any rockets shot up in the air for seven months.
0371	Donald Trump	You haven't had any research.
0372	Donald Trump	They just blew up their test site.
0373	Donald Trump	They're blowing up their engine test site for ballistic missiles.
0374	Donald Trump	He's giving us back our great heroes who died, as you know.
0375	Steve Doocy	Right.
0376	Donald Trump	We're getting their remains back.
0377	Donald Trump	And I've had so many people, so many parents, so many fathers and daughters and sons asking me, "Please, please."
0378	Steve Doocy	Right.
0379	Donald Trump	This is during the campaign and after.
0380	Donald Trump	I say, I don't have exactly a good relationship.
0381	Donald Trump	Anyway, during the meeting  and we really did hit it off.
0382	Donald Trump	During the  you know, good chemistry.
0383	Steve Doocy	You  you have since used some very friendly words regarding him.
0384	Steve Doocy	And you're taking some heat for that.
0385	Donald Trump	Yes.
0386	Donald Trump	I mean, that's what it is.
0387	Donald Trump	I take heat.
0388	Donald Trump	But what am supposed to do, walk out and say "terrible"?
0389	Donald Trump	I mean, I  I got along with him very well.
0390	Donald Trump	We have good chemistry.
0391	Donald Trump	I asked him, "The remains I'd like to get them."
0392	Steve Doocy	Right
0393	Donald Trump	He said, "Yes, we will do that."
0394	Donald Trump	They are already starting to produce the remains of these great young soldiers who were left in North Korea.
0395	Steve Doocy	Right.
0396	Donald Trump	We're getting the remains, and nobody thought that was possible.
0397	Steve Doocy	The way you have described things, it sounds like you feel that he's on the road to denuking.
0398	Donald Trump	Oh, absolutely.
0399	Donald Trump	It's in the agreement It says he will denuclearize.
0400	Steve Doocy	Right.
0401	Steve Doocy	I know it's, kind of, broad...
0402	Donald Trump	You know, it's funny  it's funny when you see the fake news, because  and you guys aren't fake.
0403	Donald Trump	But I signed an agreement where we get everything.
0404	Donald Trump	Everything.
0405	Donald Trump	But they say "Trump lost because he agreed to meet.
0406	Donald Trump	Trump agreed to meet."
0407	Steve Doocy	Got the picture.
0408	Donald Trump	No, it's a funny thing.
0409	Donald Trump	You got to watch CNN.
0410	Donald Trump	I mean, what  what a fraud it is.
0411	Donald Trump	They go, "Trump is..."
0412	Steve Doocy	They're listening.
0413	Steve Doocy	They're right behind you, right there.
0414	Donald Trump	That's fine.
0415	Donald Trump	Do you hear me?
0416	Donald Trump	Trump agreed to meet.
0417	Donald Trump	I say I agreed to meet.
0418	Donald Trump	Of course you got to agree to meet.
0419	Donald Trump	If you don't agree to meet, you know what you're going to have?
0420	Donald Trump	You're going to have nuclear war, that's what you're going to have.
0421	Donald Trump	I have a great relationship.
0422	Donald Trump	He gave us back our hostages.
0423	Donald Trump	I didn't pay $1.8 billion.
0424	Donald Trump	I paid nothing.
0425	Steve Doocy	Right.
0426	Donald Trump	But it was very smart that he did it.
0427	Donald Trump	He gave us back our hostages.
0428	Donald Trump	He's giving us back the remains of probably 7,500 soldiers.
0429	Steve Doocy	Really?
0430	Donald Trump	Yeah.
0431	Donald Trump	There's a tremendous number of soldiers.
0432	Donald Trump	Tremendous number of MIAs, you know, folks that just never  they've never been found.
0433	Steve Doocy	It sounds like...
0434	Donald Trump	And they  and by the way, they know where many of these bodies are.
0435	Steve Doocy	What  what is the stage of the meetings now?
0436	Steve Doocy	I know, you know...
0437	Donald Trump	It's great.
0438	Donald Trump	Mike Pompeo is just leaving there.
0439	Donald Trump	He was in South Korea. Any developments
0440	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]
0441	Donald Trump	?
0442	Donald Trump	We're getting along great with South Korea.
0443	Donald Trump	We're getting along great with China.
0444	Donald Trump	Probably until this morning, because we just did a tariff in China.
0445	Donald Trump	But that's OK, because I have a wonderful relationship with President Xi.
0446	Donald Trump	We'll all work it out.
0447	Donald Trump	He understands it's unfair.
0448	Steve Doocy	Right.
0449	Donald Trump	They can't believe they got away with it for so long, Steve.
0450	Steve Doocy	Right.
0451	Donald Trump	They can't believe it.
0452	Donald Trump	I mean, they got away with it for 25 years.
0453	Donald Trump	I'm not just blaming Obama.
0454	Donald Trump	I'm blaming many presidents and leaders.
0455	Steve Doocy	At what point...
0456	Donald Trump	It should have never happened.
0457	Steve Doocy	At what point do the sanctions come off of North Korea?
0458	Donald Trump	When we can be sure there will be no more nuclear.
0459	Steve Doocy	How close are we to that?
0460	Donald Trump	Very close.
0461	Donald Trump	We're very close to getting it started.
0462	Donald Trump	He wants to do it.
0463	Donald Trump	He wants to do something great with his country.
0464	Donald Trump	He wants to make his country great.
0465	Steve Doocy	So, you are saying that you'll relieve the sanctions once whatever he's going to do...
0466	Donald Trump	Once we know...
0467	Steve Doocy	...is completely  that stuff doesn't work anymore.
0468	Donald Trump	Once we know that it can't happen.
0469	Steve Doocy	Right.
0470	Donald Trump	And I'm telling you right now, with the relationship I have, it's not going to happen.
0471	Donald Trump	Hey, you haven't had a rocket test in seven months.
0472	Steve Doocy	Right.
0473	Donald Trump	I was with Prime Minister Abe, another good friend of mine from Japan.
0474	Donald Trump	I said, "When's the last time you had a rocket flying over Japan?"
0475	Donald Trump	He said, "It has not happened."
0476	Donald Trump	I said, "It won't happen.
0477	Donald Trump	Don't worry about."
0478	Steve Doocy	Right.
0479	Steve Doocy	Are we close to seeing Mr. Kim here at the White House?
0480	Donald Trump	It could happen.
0481	Donald Trump	I mean, yeah, I would have him. Did they talk about that...
0482	SYSTEM	[Crosstalk]
0483	Donald Trump	Yeah.
0484	Donald Trump	I think it's something that could happen.
0485	Donald Trump	Yeah.
0486	Donald Trump	Hey, he's the head of a country.
0487	Donald Trump	And I mean he is the strong head.
0488	Donald Trump	Don't let anyone think anything different.
0489	Steve Doocy	Right.
0490	Donald Trump	He speaks and his people sit up at attention.
0491	Donald Trump	I want my people to do the same.
0492	Steve Doocy	Well, just before you met with him, he cleaned house.
0493	Steve Doocy	Three of his top generals, some of the hardliners he fired.
0494	Donald Trump	Yeah, that's what I hear.
0495	Steve Doocy	Then you go over there.
0496	Steve Doocy	And you got  you took some heat over saluting one of the generals.
0497	Donald Trump	I think he fired at least, OK, when you say he fired.
0498	Steve Doocy	Three that we know of.
0499	Donald Trump	I think maybe fired at least.
0500	Donald Trump	Fired may be a nice word.
0501	Donald Trump	That's right, I met a general.
0502	Donald Trump	He saluted me, I saluted him back.
0503	Donald Trump	And I guess their using that as another sound bite.
0504	Donald Trump	I mean, you know, I think I'm being respectful to the general.
0505	Donald Trump	We are  we have a very good relationship with North Korea.
0506	Steve Doocy	Right.
0507	Donald Trump	When I was talking to President Obama, he essentially was ready to go to war with North Korea.
0508	Donald Trump	He felt you had to almost go to war.
0509	Donald Trump	And I did ask him "Have you spoken to him?"
0510	Donald Trump	He goes, "No."
0511	Donald Trump	I said, "Do you think it would be a good thing to speak to him maybe?"
0512	Steve Doocy	Right.
0513	Donald Trump	OK. Because if you go to war there, you're not talking about 100,000 lives, which is a lot.
0514	Steve Doocy	Right.
0515	Donald Trump	You're talking about 30, 40, 50 million lives.
0516	Steve Doocy	Sure.
0517	Donald Trump	Seoul is 30 miles off the border.
0518	Donald Trump	They don't even need nuclear weapons to take out Seoul.
0519	Donald Trump	They have thousands of cannons  they call them cannons they have big guns  thousands pointed right at Seoul.
0520	Donald Trump	We have a really great relationship for the first time ever.
0521	Donald Trump	No president's ever had this.
0522	Donald Trump	So I get hit by these fakes back here.
0523	Donald Trump	Not all of them.
0524	Donald Trump	Some are phenomenal.
0525	Donald Trump	But I get hit, because I went there, I gave him credibility.
0526	Donald Trump	I think it's great to give him credibility.
0527	Donald Trump	Here's what we got everything, point after point after point.
0528	Steve Doocy	One point, I think it was in the last week, 10 days, things are going faster in Washington, just saying.
0529	Steve Doocy	But...
0530	Donald Trump	We're having a lot of fun, right?
0531	Donald Trump	So supposing Hillary got elected instead of Trump, do you think it would be so exciting?
0532	Donald Trump	Your ratings would be way down.
0533	Donald Trump	Number one show in the morning, folks.
0534	Steve Doocy	Well, thank you.
0535	Steve Doocy	I've heard you say the others  in cable news.
0536	Steve Doocy	That's right.
0537	Steve Doocy	It was within the last...
0538	Donald Trump	Actually also beyond cable news you're doing pretty well.
0539	Steve Doocy	We're doing OK.
0540	Steve Doocy	Thanks for dropping by...
0541	Donald Trump	I like ratings. All the others
0542	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]
0543	Donald Trump	.
0544	Donald Trump	I study ratings, broadcasting.
0545	Steve Doocy	You had mentioned the NFL players and the  you know, some taking a knee.
0546	Steve Doocy	And you would like to hear some of the stories of people who you should pardon.
0547	Steve Doocy	And you mentioned professional athletes.
0548	Steve Doocy	Have you heard from any of them?
0549	Donald Trump	No.
0550	Donald Trump	I haven't heard.
0551	Donald Trump	You know, they were all saying, "Oh, it has nothing to do with the flag.
0552	Donald Trump	It's the way we've been treated," and in the meantime they're making $15 million a year.
0553	Donald Trump	Look, I'm all for the athletes.
0554	Donald Trump	I think it's great.
0555	Donald Trump	I love athletics.
0556	Donald Trump	I love sports.
0557	Donald Trump	But they shouldn't get the politics involved.
0558	Donald Trump	When you're in a stadium and they broadcast that national anthem, you got to stand, and you got to be proud, and you got to have your hand up, and you got to do everything that's right.
0559	Donald Trump	And then go out and play really tough football.
0560	Donald Trump	And once you leave that stadium, go and do whatever you want to do.
0561	Donald Trump	Run for office, or do whatever.
0562	Donald Trump	But I did say, you know, I have this tremendous power of pardon.
0563	Donald Trump	And Kim Kardashian came in, and the woman 22 years in jail
0564	Steve Doocy	People can't believe that you would be listening to Kim Kardashian.
0565	Donald Trump	Oh, I did.
0566	Donald Trump	I don't know her, and I met her and she was really nice, I have to say, and very capable.
0567	Donald Trump	But she came in and she said, "This is a very unfair situation."
0568	Donald Trump	I looked at her and I agreed.
0569	Donald Trump	Twenty  she's in there for 22 years, she's got another 20 years to serve, and you have drug dealers that are doing big stuff and they get a twomonth sentence, OK. You know, it was just unfair.
0570	Donald Trump	And I thought it was a beautiful scene when that woman left prison and ran over to  it looked like her grandkids, it was a couple of big strong guys.
0571	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]
0572	Donald Trump	.
0573	Donald Trump	Big strong guys, some wonderful women.
0574	Donald Trump	They were all hugging and kissing and everyone's crying.
0575	Donald Trump	To me that was a beautiful scene.
0576	Donald Trump	Well, she thanked me but, you know, thanked Kim, because I wouldn't have known about it.
0577	Steve Doocy	Yeah.
0578	Donald Trump	And I told the NFL players, I mean, indirectly  I said, "You have somebody that's aggrieved"  because they're saying people are aggrieved, OK. "Let me know about it.
0579	Donald Trump	I'll look at it.
0580	Donald Trump	If they're aggrieved, I will pardon them, I'll get them out."
0581	Steve Doocy	I'm shocked you haven't heard from a single one.
0582	Donald Trump	I don't think I've from one.
0583	Donald Trump	Now, maybe they've called the staff, but I have not personally heard from one.
0584	Steve Doocy	Yeah.
0585	Steve Doocy	Speaking of the staff...
0586	Donald Trump	Because I don't know if it's a real issue.
0587	Donald Trump	I don't think it's a real issue.
0588	Steve Doocy	Sarah Huckabee Sanders, your press secretary, she's  she took a lot of heat yesterday from the people behind you.
0589	Donald Trump	Oh, she did?
0590	Donald Trump	I didn't know that.
0591	Steve Doocy	Well, she did.
0592	Steve Doocy	There was some suggestion that maybe she'd be leaving the White House.
0593	Donald Trump	I don't think so.
0594	Donald Trump	You know, look at a certain point everyone, sort of, leaves.
0595	Donald Trump	You have to leave.
0596	Donald Trump	I'm, sort of, just standing  I'm like a ship, just keep going, bing, bing.
0597	Donald Trump	But Sarah loves this job and she's announced  not with me, I read that same report.
0598	Donald Trump	Somebody put it out, I think it was CBS  when she said it's a false report.
0599	Donald Trump	But it's fake news.
0600	Donald Trump	But at some point I'm sure she'll leave, like everybody leaves and we'll get somebody else.
0601	Donald Trump	But Sarah's done a fantastic job.
0602	Donald Trump	No, I don't think she's leaving.
0603	Steve Doocy	What do you make of the...
0604	Donald Trump	In fact, she was very insulted that they came out and said that.
0605	Steve Doocy	Right.
0606	Donald Trump	So I don't think she's leaving.
0607	Steve Doocy	What do you make of the backandforth between her and the press?
0608	Steve Doocy	Because sometimes it gets loud.
0609	Donald Trump	Well, I think the press  I think the press treats Sarah very unfairly.
0610	Donald Trump	That White House correspondent... But I think some of them feel she's not answering their questions, so they're going to ask it again and ask
0611	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]
0612	Donald Trump	.
0613	Donald Trump	Well, I gave a press conference in Singapore that was like an hour and a half, and that was like the biggest press group I've ever seen.
0614	Donald Trump	And I answered every single question.
0615	Donald Trump	I'd answer anybody's question.
0616	Donald Trump	I guess that's not supposed to be my job.
0617	Donald Trump	I'm here with you today, you're giving me a lot of...
0618	Steve Doocy	Well, thank you very much.
0619	Donald Trump	...lot of interesting questions.
0620	Donald Trump	But  but, Steve, I think Sarah is really a good person and a nice person, very capable.
0621	Donald Trump	She's got a lot of the father's genes, because her father is great.
0622	Steve Doocy	Mike.
0623	Steve Doocy	OK.
0624	Donald Trump	Don't forget he got up there on that debate stage and he said, "Nobody's going to beat Trump."
0625	Donald Trump	And I even decided to  he was running.
0626	Donald Trump	And I even decided to wear a Trump tie.
0627	Donald Trump	And I said, "I love that guy."
0628	Donald Trump	I loved him, OK. Mike, is a very talented guy and Sarah's a very talented person.
0629	Donald Trump	But they treat her very badly.
0630	Donald Trump	What they did Sarah at the White House Correspondents  now, the only difference I would have done, I would have walked out.
0631	Donald Trump	I thought she should have walked out instead of sitting there.
0632	Donald Trump	But, you know...
0633	Steve Doocy	She took a high road.
0634	Donald Trump	She took a very high road.
0635	Donald Trump	Sometimes...
0636	Steve Doocy	Yeah.
0637	Donald Trump	...you don't take such a high road.
0638	Steve Doocy	We had Stewart Varney on our air...
0639	Donald Trump	By the way, he is great.
0640	Donald Trump	I love Stewart.
0641	Steve Doocy	That little part, he's going to be running every day now.
0642	Donald Trump	No, I love him.
0643	Donald Trump	And he's right.
0644	Donald Trump	He knows what he's talking about.
0645	Steve Doocy	Well, he suggested that the next quarter GDP could be 4 percent.
0646	Donald Trump	Well, they're predicting  you know, the Atlanta Fed predicted 4.8 percent.
0647	Donald Trump	I think, you know, that's a lot.
0648	Donald Trump	Don't forget, then I got elected, I took this thing over, it was 1.2 and each point is $3 trillion and 10 million jobs.
0649	Donald Trump	You know, a point  people will say at home, "Oh, it's a point, what difference does it make?"
0650	Donald Trump	Well, it was 1.2 and it was going down.
0651	Donald Trump	You probably saw this morning I put out, they would have raised your taxes instead of cut your taxes, and they were going to put on more regulations.
0652	Donald Trump	The last thing we need is regulations.
0653	Donald Trump	I actually think my regulation cutting had more of an impact on the economy than the tax cuts.
0654	Steve Doocy	When you were running, you said, "For every regulation we enact, I will cut two."
0655	Donald Trump	Right.
0656	Steve Doocy	But you didn't cut two, you're cutting a much bigger number.
0657	Donald Trump	Right.
0658	Donald Trump	22, it turned out.
0659	Donald Trump	22.
0660	Donald Trump	And  and by the way, you need regulation.
0661	Donald Trump	I want the cleanest water in the world, I want the cleanest air in the world, I want that air to be so perfect.
0662	Donald Trump	And our air now is better than it was two years ago, with all of the talk and the nonsense.
0663	Donald Trump	Clean  crystal clean water, clean air.
0664	Donald Trump	But I also want our companies to be competitive so they can go around the world and compete.
0665	Donald Trump	And we were shutting down companies over the environment and they weren't doing anything wrong.
0666	Donald Trump	And that's jobs.
0667	Steve Doocy	Right.
0668	Steve Doocy	But there are some who say, "Look the EPA is relaxing a lot of rules that are out there to protect people."
0669	Donald Trump	Only rules that don't mean anything or rules that are duplicative.
0670	Donald Trump	You know, rules where you have...
0671	Steve Doocy	There's a lot of those.
0672	Donald Trump	Well, not only that, I mean, some of them you have nine different times you have to get the same thing approved by different agencies.
0673	Steve Doocy	Right.
0674	Donald Trump	To build a highway in this country takes 19 years of approvals.
0675	Donald Trump	I have it down to two years.
0676	Donald Trump	And you'll get rejected if it's wrong, if it's environmentally bad.
0677	Steve Doocy	Right.
0678	Donald Trump	But I have it down to two years.
0679	Donald Trump	I want to get it down to one year.
0680	Donald Trump	And that's indicative of everything else, too.
0681	Donald Trump	A company comes in from China, from Japan they want to spend a tremendous amount of money on building a plant or something, right?
0682	Donald Trump	It takes them seven years to get a permit, and they don't do it because it's too long.
0683	Steve Doocy	Right.
0684	Donald Trump	I have it down to one year and even faster.
0685	Donald Trump	Now, if they're wrong, we know immediately.
0686	Steve Doocy	Right.
0687	Donald Trump	You know, you don't have to wait seven years.
0688	Donald Trump	How about going through the process seven years and getting rejected?
0689	Donald Trump	How about a highway that spends 19 years getting approved and then in the last vote they get a threetotwo vote no?
0690	Steve Doocy	Right.
0691	Donald Trump	That happens oftentimes and they spend hundreds of millions of dollars on the approval.
0692	Donald Trump	Not going to happen anymore.
0693	Steve Doocy	I saw a headline on Drudge, I think this morning, unemployment at a 44year low.
0694	Donald Trump	Yeah, yeah.
0695	Donald Trump	Drudge is great, by the way.
0696	Donald Trump	Matt Drudge is a great gentleman who  who really  I don't know, he's got an ability to capture the stories that people want to see.
0697	Donald Trump	But that was the number one story on Drudge.
0698	Donald Trump	Fortyfour year low unemployment, and  and I saw that in very big letters actually...
0699	Steve Doocy	Right.
0700	Donald Trump	...and I said "That makes me very proud."
0701	Steve Doocy	Another story out there was  this past week is, while you did meet with Kim Jongun, it sounds like you and Mr. Putin may be sitting down sometime soon.
0702	Steve Doocy	What  what can you tell us about that?
0703	Donald Trump	We may.
0704	Donald Trump	And  and it started because a reporter shouted to me, "Should Putin be in the G7?"
0705	Donald Trump	I said, "No, he should be in the G8."
0706	Donald Trump	It used to be the G8 a few years ago, and I think President Obama didn't like him or  even though they gave advance notice about the election to Obama...
0707	Steve Doocy	Right.
0708	Donald Trump	...people forget about that.
0709	Donald Trump	You know, Obama was told by the CIA or somebody, FBI, about Russia.
0710	Donald Trump	He didn't do anything about it.
0711	Donald Trump	How come he never gets blamed?
0712	Steve Doocy	Right.
0713	Donald Trump	In September, just before the election, my election, he should have done it, because maybe I would have won by more.
0714	Steve Doocy	Right.
0715	Steve Doocy	Yesterday, a big day.
0716	Steve Doocy	Not only did the A.G. report come out, but it was your birthday.
0717	Donald Trump	That's right.
0718	Steve Doocy	Get any good presents?
0719	Donald Trump	I got a lot of good kisses.
0720	Donald Trump	I got a lot of phone calls from people that I would never have gotten phone calls from.
0721	Donald Trump	I got phone calls from...
0722	Steve Doocy	Who'd you get the kisses from?
0723	Donald Trump	From my beautiful wife...
0724	Steve Doocy	OK.
0725	Donald Trump	...who's really doing great, she's doing great.
0726	Donald Trump	But  and my kids.
0727	Steve Doocy	Oh, speaking of your wife...
0728	Donald Trump	Yeah?
0729	Steve Doocy	...you know, we saw a story  I think as you were heading to the chopper you said, you know, she can't fly for a month.
0730	Donald Trump	One month.
0731	Donald Trump	Well, the doctor said, "Don't fly for a month," but she'll be able to very shortly.
0732	Steve Doocy	Because she's on the mend?
0733	Donald Trump	Oh, she's in great shape.
0734	Donald Trump	She's like perfect.
0735	Steve Doocy	Right.
0736	Donald Trump	She  somebody said, "Did she have a face lift?"
0737	Donald Trump	No.
0738	Donald Trump	Did she have this?
0739	Donald Trump	Did she have that?
0740	Donald Trump	I mean, the speculation, even after the doctors gave a full  and these are White House doctors.
0741	Donald Trump	They give  you know, they give really straight stuff.
0742	Donald Trump	But no, she's doing fantastically well.
0743	Steve Doocy	We had your son Don Jr. on our show, and he said he was not getting you anything for your birthday because you've got everything.
0744	Donald Trump	Well, I just want to have a successful country.
0745	Donald Trump	I'll be honest, I  this is so intensive.
0746	Donald Trump	We've done more  I don't say this in a bragging way, actually some of the haters actually say this.
0747	Donald Trump	We've done more in 500 days  so now it's 510 days  than any 500day president first term by far.
0748	Steve Doocy	Yeah.
0749	Donald Trump	And that's what I want to do.
0750	Donald Trump	I want to really  you know, I got elected to make America great again.
0751	Donald Trump	Very simple Make America great again.
0752	Donald Trump	That's what we're doing.
0753	Donald Trump	And we are respected around the world.
0754	Donald Trump	You take a look at Iran, they're not talking about Iran taking over the Middle East.
0755	Donald Trump	I took that crazy deal that Obama gave them away.
0756	Donald Trump	Iran is not looking to the Mediterranean anymore.
0757	Donald Trump	You know, they had to go through a lot of territory to get there.
0758	Steve Doocy	Right.
0759	Donald Trump	They're looking to survive.
0760	Donald Trump	But I will tell you, some day soon they're going to come back and they're going to want to negotiate a deal and we'll make a deal.
0761	Donald Trump	But they were nasty.
0762	Donald Trump	They were very, very nasty, and it had to be stopped.
0763	Donald Trump	I took away the deal, and I think they've been treating America with much more respect.
0764	Donald Trump	And I have to say that you don't see the little boats circling our boats anymore do you notice that?
0765	Donald Trump	Remember with Obama, you had this beautiful destroyer, you had this Annapolis captain on the boat, and he's sitting there, and you could see he's like a boiler waiting to explode, because he was giving orders.
0766	Donald Trump	And they were circling us with those boats, right?
0767	Donald Trump	And he wanted to shoot the hell out of them...
0768	Steve Doocy	Well, they were harassing  trying to engage...
0769	Donald Trump	He wanted to  they were harassing our  our guys.
0770	Donald Trump	And he wanted to shoot the hell out of them.
0771	Steve Doocy	Yeah.
0772	Donald Trump	And you don't see that stuff anymore.
0773	Donald Trump	By the way, when they captured our 10 sailors and made them get on their knees, you're not going to see that anymore.
0774	Steve Doocy	I hear the bells in the distance.
0775	Steve Doocy	We're coming up on 9 o'clock in the East.
0776	Steve Doocy	How're you going to celebrate Father's Day?
0777	Donald Trump	Work.
0778	Donald Trump	I'm going to work.
0779	Donald Trump	I'm going to actually be calling North Korea.
0780	Donald Trump	I'm going to be calling...
0781	Steve Doocy	What are you going to say to him?
0782	Donald Trump	I just had  right now I have a call from your friend from France, Emmanuel.
0783	Steve Doocy	What are you going to tell him?
0784	Donald Trump	I'm going to tell him, "You have to treat us better on trade."
0785	Donald Trump	European Union's not treating us well on trade.
0786	Donald Trump	I love trade.
0787	Donald Trump	You know, trades always been my thing.
0788	Donald Trump	Even 20 years ago when I'd be talking to you, trade was always my thing.
0789	Donald Trump	It's probably  I'm getting a lot of credit for what we're doing foreign, but I  I think my best thing is going to be trade.
0790	Donald Trump	We have to straighten out our trade.
0791	Donald Trump	You know, we're doing well despite our bad trade deals.
0792	Donald Trump	After we do our trade deals, what 'til you see the numbers.
0793	Steve Doocy	Right.
