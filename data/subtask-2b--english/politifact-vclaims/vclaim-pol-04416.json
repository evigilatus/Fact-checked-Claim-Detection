Reynolds. Its campaign says online and in radio ads that the measure \"cheats schools out of at least $600 million a year.\"\nThe industry attacks are not surprising. And they\u2019ll likely continue as opponents of the measure have raised more than $35 million, while supporters have collected about $17 million.\nWe wondered whether there\u2019s any truth to the claim that Prop 56 \u2018cheats\u2019 schools out of all that money.\nOur research\nNearly three decades ago, voters in California approved Proposition 98 requiring a minimum level of funding for public education. It requires the state to dedicate roughly 40 percent of new General Fund revenues to K-12 schools and community colleges.\nProp 56 would generate\u00a0up to $1.4 billion in tax revenue its first year.\nBut instead of sending that revenue to the General Fund, Prop 56 would place it in a special fund to help pay for Medi-Cal, which provides health coverage for millions of low-income Californians.\nWe asked the No on 56 campaign for evidence that the tobacco tax measure \u2018cheats\u2019 schools. A spokeswoman pointed to language in the measure that exempts Prop 56 from the school funding guarantee.\nThe campaign said this exemption is proof that the measure undermines the funding guarantee and \u2018cheats\u2019 schools.\nBut the experts we spoke with say there\u2019s nothing new about this proposal. Past tobacco taxes, in 1988 and 1998, also established special funds rather than sending money to the General Fund.\nOne of the experts said the opponents\u2019 claim is misleading.\n\"When I think of this claim that the schools are going to be cheated -- particularly that word \u2018cheated\u2019 out of this money -- that suggests something that\u2019s wrong or illegal. And this is not the case,\" said Steve Boilard, executive director of Sacramento State University\u2019s Center for California Studies. \"There\u2019s plenty of examples where new revenue is raised that is not subject to the Prop 98 funding guarantee.\"\nBoilard pointed to Proposition 63, a tax on wealthy Californians that funds mental health services.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurran Kelleher / Flickr\nOthers reject claim\nState Superintendent of Public Instruction Tom Torlakson rejected the claim that the new tax measure \u2018cheats\u2019 schools.\nIn a recent letter circulated by the Yes on 56 campaign, he wrote: \"Make no mistake, Proposition 56 will not divert a dime away from schools. Rather, it will raise revenues for school based tobacco prevention and intervention programs.\"\nA report by the Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office estimates Prop 56 will add $20 million for those school based programs.\nThe Sacramento Bee\u2019s fact-checking team, PoliGRAPH,\u00a0recently examined the same claim about Prop 56 \u2018cheating\u2019 schools.\nIt found that it \"isn\u2019t fair to say the measure 'cheats'\u00a0schools out of $600 million a year. Nothing in the measure reduces school funding. If the measure passes, the budget for schools does not decrease.\"\nOur ruling\nThe No on 56 campaign is running ads that say the proposed\u00a0tobacco tax \"cheats schools out of at least $600 million a year.\"\nThe measure includes an exemption from the state\u2019s school funding\u00a0guarantee. A portion of its revenues, estimated at up to $1.4 billion, could otherwise have been directed toward school funding.\nBut past tobacco taxes and a tax to fund mental health services have also legally avoided this guarantee. Those had exemptions allowing their revenues to fund health services.\nThis doesn't mean, however, that money will be taken from schools or community colleges under Prop 56. The measure, in fact, sends about $20 million to schools for tobacco prevention programs.\nThe claim that Prop 56 \"cheats\" schools goes too far. It might have been accurate to say the measure exempts most all revenue from going to schools.\nBut the term chosen by No on 56 is misleading.\nWe rate the claim Mostly False.\n\nMOSTLY FALSE\u00a0\u2013 The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.\nClick here for\u00a0more\u00a0on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/aabdc989-5155-4716-837a-cae1783eac21", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04416"}
