The term Scott Walker is \"four years of political battles, criminal convictions... and secret donations. Tax cuts for rich people are 10 times your size, job promises -- a break.\" In the middle of the story to the list of ills, there's an audio clip from a television news release -- \"Criminal convictions of six assistants or supporters of Walker...\" -- But a real bowel punch is a silent blow. On top of the photos, the ad highlights the main address of Milwaukee Journal Centinel: \"The prosecutors claim that Scott Walker is at the center of the criminal scheme.\" The Declaration refers to two separate criminal investigations: a closed investigation has now taken place in the trap of three senior assistants to Walker and three other assistants from his days as Executive Director of Milwaukee Province; and an ongoing search for whether his campaign was coordinated with non-profit groups during the 2012 elections. However, the announcement combines the two investigations - neither of which actually led to a false accusation of Walker - to give a false impression to the viewers. Let's untie the knot in the ad. The Prosecutor of Milwaukee John Chisholm District sought to conduct the investigations. Both used what was referred to in Wisconsin as the John Doe investigation, which allows prosecutors to force people to testify and produce documents and prevent them from publicly speaking about the investigation. Thus, they became known as John Doe 1 and John Doe 2. The first began in May 2010 and was actually generated by a request from the Walker District Office to Chesholm to investigate whether money had been stolen from Operation Freedom, an event run by Walker for military veterans. From there, the investigation went in several directions. At the time of the closure of the Tribunal in February 2013, there were five convictions on charges ranging from theft linked to the war veterans &apos; event to election campaigns at the time of the year and illegal contributions to the Walker campaign. A sixth person, a local partner to help Walker, was convicted of contributing to the delinquency of a child because of sexually explicit text exchanges with what was found to be a 17-year-old boy. Walker set up a criminal defense fund during the investigation. No charges were brought against him. Three of the convicts were in key positions in the Walker District Office, and the conduct under investigation dates back to 2010 and earlier. To return to the Declaration. On January 9, 2021, on Twitter, Sarah Goodlowski stated: \"Not all women lost jobs (in December's job report), most of them black and Latin women. In fact, white women got a job.\" More than a year after John Doe 1 stopped working. The story referred to a subsequent investigation, John Doe 2, concerning Walker &apos; s time as Governor, not an Executive Director of Milwaukee District. The prosecutors launched the John Doe II probe in August 2012 in Milwaukee District and extended it in 2013 to four other provinces. There is some overlap in the two topics of investigation, and sources have informed the Journal Sentinel that the second investigation originated from the evidence found by prosecutors in the first investigation. However, the probes are legally separate and cover different regions and time frames. In the second investigation, prosecutors consider whether Walker has illegally coordinated fund-raising among conservative groups to assist his campaign and that of Republican Senators facing repatriation elections during 2011 and 2012. One group sued the prosecutors, and the investigation was suspended by court decisions. In January 2014, Judge John de Gregory Peterson revoked the summonses issued in the investigation and ruled that he did not believe anything illegal had happened. The decision effectively closed the investigation. Subsequently, U.S. Judge Rudolf Randa in Milwaukee blocked the probe, but was set aside by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeal. Various appeals are pending. In the court documents that were closed in one case, prosecutors presented what they considered to be a widespread \"criminal scheme\" to override state election laws by Walker, his campaign and two senior Republican political activists. But it is important to note that this is their view of the case. The word \"league\" in the title is not linked to the charges, as the viewers may assume. None were submitted. Walker denied any error and accused Chisholm, a democracy, of having acted in a partisan manner. When asked to strengthen the link between the two declarations, the Burke campaign told us that it did not intend to confuse the two investigations. Instead, she said that the campaign believed that addressing multiple topics from four years of Walker &apos; s Declaration in a single 30-second declaration required intensifying references to criminal investigations. But the screen photos speak for themselves. Our website for Burke gives the impression that six convictions are linked to a prosecutor's claim. Scott Walker is in the center of a criminal scheme.\" The investigations marked the four years Walker had spent in office. The prosecution theory in one case put Walker at the centre of electoral violations, as the announcement indicates. However, no charges had been brought in that case, with a state judge dismissing the summonses requested from the prosecutors. The probe was disabled by various lawsuits. The Burke announcement compresses time and two separate investigations to suggest that prosecutors accused six persons in a case alleging that the Governor is in the position of misconduct. We're assessing the allegation wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07095"}
