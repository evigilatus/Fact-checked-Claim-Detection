The New Yorkers ended this practice in the state in 2014, and Sanders called for a nationwide ban during the 11 April march in Pinghamton. In contrast, Clinton is still on the side of the homeless, Sanders said in the NBC me the Press, when he launched a multifaceted attack on Clinton's positions on cracking, trade and campaign financing. \"Well, when you vote for almost every trade agreement that cost this country's workers millions of jobs, when you support and continue to support the breakup, despite our crisis in terms of clean water,\" he said on April 10, \"and basically, when you do, Was Saunders telling the truth? (We have studied Clinton's support for free trade in a separate verification of facts.) While Clinton &apos; s previous support for the break-up is well documented, its current position leaves a more volatile area than the Sanders Statement suggests. \"Chal Rog\" worldwide means that producers blow up compressed water, sand and chemicals in rocky underground miles to extract natural gas. The Environmental Protection Agency considers rock gas to be clean energy. However, some environmental scientists doubt that this is much better than coal or oil, given reports that fractures can cause methane leakage (green gas, which is much stronger than carbon dioxide), earthquakes and water fires. It is clear that Clinton supported this practice as Secretary of State. Her Special Envoy for International Energy launched the Global Chale Gas Initiative, which encourages other countries to explore rock as an energy source. An in-depth investigation by Mother Jones' progressive magazine said that Clinton's support for breaking up was \"part of a broader push to combat climate change, enhance global energy supply, and restrict the power of opponents like Russia who use their energy resources as a blow.\" We have found cases in which Clinton and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have taken place in Latin America, the European Union, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Bulgaria, Pakistan, China and India. \"The United States will encourage the use of rock gas. Now, I know that in some places it's controversial. But natural gas is the cleanest fossil fuel available for power generation today, and a number of countries in the Americas may have rock gas resources, as Clinton said in a 2009 address to the Inter-American Development Bank. After leaving the State Department in 2013, Clinton continued to support the cracking but repeatedly called for \"smart regulations\" in speeches and in her book, hard choices. If you compare Clinton with the unequivocal opposition of Sanders and the strong support of the Republicans, it has a more complex answer when it comes to cracking. It is mainly supported as long as there is environmental control and there is no domestic opposition. Here's how Clinton explained her position during the March 6 debate in Flint, Michigan: \"I don't support it when any position or State is against her, no. 1. I don't support it when there's a methane release or water pollution. - I don't support it. - No. 3. Unless we can ask anyone conducting the inspection to tell us exactly what chemicals they use. So by the time we get through all my terms, I don't think there's gonna be many places in America where the breakup will continue. And I think this is the best approach, because right now, there are places where cracking is being done that aren't organized enough.\" \"My answer is much shorter,\" Sanders replied. \"No, I don't support cracking.\" Clinton's spokesman, Josh Schorin, referred to the Clinton Plan \"to address the risks associated with the cracking people are worried about.\" The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \"This is particularly important because the federal government cannot say where the breakup is happening and where it is not, but can put new safeguards into effect,\" said Shurain. Katie Brown of Deep Energy, the research and educational arm of the American Independent Petroleum Association, told Polyte Fact that Sanders &apos; attitude was to ban all out-of-flow break-ups. \"Hilary Clinton, on the other hand, joins Democrats throughout the province, such as S. Chuck Schommer, and California Goff. Jerry Brown and Colorado Goff. John Hickenlooper said (but not limited to) that all of them had broken strong systems by the states and supported the cracking for their environmental and economic benefits.\" We referred Warren Ganls, Director of Sanders Policy, to an article by Reuters, in which breakers gave Clinton's comments as an address to the campaign, urging the opposition to stop warnings and ban them completely. But what exactly does Clinton's warnings mean to predators? A picture of the three conditions set by Clinton in the area of regulated extraction would support the existing ban and add new conditions to this mix. However, it will not amount to a global ban. The first condition leaves the domestic and state embargo in place, such as in Vermont, New York, and several dozen cities and districts throughout America. Its second condition will add dozens of sites containing CH4 emissions or water pollution. Natural gas is methane in the first place, so we're going to assume that Clinton is talking about \"future emissions\" or leakages. The estimates of fugitive emissions vary considerably, usually expressed as a percentage of total production. A series of studies through the Control Code reached estimates ranging from 0.6 per cent to 9 per cent (the threshold of 3.2 per cent cleaner coal). Various industries and independent research indicate that a large part of the leakage comes from a small number of \"supernatural phenomena\" (approximately one out of every 25 facilities, according to the University of Colorado study in 2015). Clinton had apparently been able to close these methane borettes, which include, for example, some 50 production sites in North Texas and four lift wells on the Gulf coast. According to a controversial study conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency in 2015, water pollution is not systematic, but it has identified 151 cases of fluid spill in 11 states from 2006 to 2012. Robert Huarth, a prominent critic of biogeological cracking and chemistry at Cornell University, estimates that at least 4 percent of the production wells are contaminated with water, but claims that the problem is widespread due to the large number of wells. In the case of Clinton, for example, cracking can be banned in at least 25 provinces in Pennsylvania and at least 12 provinces in Colorado, if not in all 11 states where leaks have been observed. The homeless are already meeting the third Clinton clause to some extent. At least 26 states have some rules on detecting chemicals in books, although most of Frackers' permission to protect \"commercial secrets,\" according to the American Chemical Society. In addition, the Obama Administration is now requesting drillers on federal and tribal lands to report the installation of their break-up fluid to Frac Fox, an industry-supported register of over 100,000 wells throughout America. (This is an example.) Environmentalists claim that these rules are almost inadequate. Hoarth told Poletti Fuckett that chemical additives are \"a small part of the problem.\" He said: \"Return fluids are filled with very bad materials as well as additives, and the nature of this toxic drink is rarely known.\" \"Clinton's focus on misleading additives.\" However, Clinton &apos; s case could prohibit the break-up in Virginia and Missouri, two mandates that are active in the break-up, but there are no rules for detection at the time of reporting. Here's a map of how Clinton's circumstances can affect America's fracture: Saunders our governor said that Clinton has supported and continues to \"support the breakup.\" As Secretary of State, Clinton supported and encouraged breaking up around the world. As a candidate in 2016, its support comes with conditions such as local selection, stronger environmental regulation and chemicals. Sanders &apos; claim is accurate but requires additional information. We're mostly assessing it right. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/dd01d743-dd9a-410f-9333-f165f160d951", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05109"}
