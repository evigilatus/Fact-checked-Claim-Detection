It stemmed from an unsettling ghoul-like figure known as \"Momo\" that reportedly appeared online and encouraged unsuspecting children to hurt themselves. Except it was a hoax \u2014 the \"Momo challenge\" isn\u2019t real.\nSo we wondered when we saw a warning about another Internet-based threat. What appears to be a screenshot of a Facebook post was shared on the social media platform on May 7 encouraging parents to \"take no chances.\"\n\"Warning to all parents with children that have any electronics devices,\" the Facebook post says in all caps. \"There is a site called Talking Angela, this site asks kids questions like: there (sic) names, where they go to school and also take pictures of their faces by pushing a heart on the bottom left corner without any notices. Please check your children\u2019s iPods and all to make sure they do not have this app!!! Please pass this message on to your friends and family members that have kids!!!!\"\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nWe\u2019ll cut to the chase: As far as we can tell, the app doesn\u2019t take users\u2019 photos and Angela can\u2019t ask questions unless she\u2019s repeating back a question you asked her. The app once included a chat feature that let users text with Angela and she could ask questions there, but that no longer seems to be an option.\nHere\u2019s what we know.\nTalking Angela is an app from Outfit7. The company\u2019s website invites users to join Angela, a white cat with blue eyes, \"in Paris \u2014 the city of love, style and magic.\"\n\"There are so many surprises, you better sit down. ;),\" the description says. \"Enjoy amazing gifts, pick the latest styles, and sip magical cocktails to experience special moments. And watch out for birds \u2014 you never know what might fly by.\" \u00a0\nOutfit7 didn\u2019t immediately respond to an email from PolitiFact asking about the Facebook post. But we downloaded the app to experience Talking Angela for ourselves. First, the app asks users for the year they were born and this writer confirmed that she is an adult. After allowing the app to access my microphone, Angela appears dressed in a blue, strapless dress. She\u2019s sitting at a cafe table, blinking and occasionally yawning. By touching the screen, I can make her giggle or reach for her tail with a shriek. Tap her nose and she sneezes. Because my microphone is enabled, Angela also repeats what I say.\nThere\u2019s a button that directs users to YouTube and four buttons on the bottom of the screen that let users buy gifts for Angela or summons birds to fly across the screen. There is a pink heart, like the Facebook post says, though it\u2019s in the bottom right corner. Clicking on the heart brings a dog dressed as a waiter onto the screen and he presents Angela with a chocolate that she opens. A fortune appears on the screen and users have the option to save it to their phone\u2019s photos. (\"Just because you don\u2019t have a prince, doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not a princess,\" one says.)\nAngela didn\u2019t ask me any questions unless she was repeating a question I asked her. But news coverage of the app in 2014 suggests parents then had valid reasons for concern.\nBack then there were rumors the app was a front for a pedohile ring. Writing for The Guardian, Stuart Dredge concluded that it was a hoax, but he noted that Outfit7 could improve the how children interact with the app.\nTalking Angela is for both adults and children but when Dredge wrote his story in 2014, there was a \"child mode\" setting (when we used the app, we couldn\u2019t find such a setting).\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you\u2019ve read about Angela asking kids for their names, ages or engaging in banter about clothes-swapping parties, none of this can happen if Child Mode is on,\" he wrote. \"The downside of this: it\u2019s far too easy to toggle it on and off.\"\nThere was also a camera feature, he said in the article, \"that encourages users to look into their device\u2019s camera and make specific gestures: nod, shake head, smile, yawn or stick your their tongue, so Angela can copy it.\" (This wasn\u2019t a feature when we used the app.) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nLastly, Dredge wrote, when \"child mode\" is turned off, users can chat with Angela using a text box at the bottom of the screen. She asked him questions like, \"How long have you been friends with your best friend?\" and \"I\u2019m 18. How old are you?\"\nWhen USA Today ran an article in 2014 about the pedophile ring hoax, Samo Login, Outfit7\u2019s cofounder, told the newspaper that the app is based on chatbot software and it isn\u2019t possible for a human to take over talking for Angela. The story goes on:\nWhen the text-chat feature is on, Angela asks the user for their name, age and personal preferences to determine conversation topics. Outfit 7 said the data from the app is \"anonymized\" and all personal information removed.\nIn 2013, Sophos, a security software company, called warnings that the app steals children\u2019s names and details of where they go to school and takes secret pictures of their faces \"bogus.\" A blog post about the rumors says:\nThe chain letter warning about the \"Talking Angela\" iOS app is being unwittingly spread by Facebook users, presumably with the thinking of \"better safe than sorry\" rather than \"maybe I should just check the facts before forwarding this scare onto my friends.\" The truth is \"talking Angela\" appears to be entirely benign, and there are no obvious privacy concerns that differentiate it from thousands of other iPhone apps.\nIt seems that now the app doesn\u2019t have a chatting option at all, regardless of the users\u2019 age. A Change.org petition from 2017 complains that even though rumors about the app were false, the option for adults to chat with Angela was removed. \u00a0\n\"The game is now a shell of its former self,\" the campaign creator wrote, \"but, with your support, we will tell Outfit7 we want it back!\"\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post claims that the Talking Angela\u00a0app asks children personal questions and takes their picture without warning.\nIt\u2019s true that the app once allowed users to text with Angela if the app was not in \"child mode,\" but that option appears to have been stripped of all versions, regardless of the user\u2019s age or settings.\nPushing the heart in the corner of the app also doesn\u2019t take a picture, as the Facebook post says. Rather, it generates a fortune with a picture of Angela that users can save to their photos on their phones.\nWe rate this Facebook post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00638"}
