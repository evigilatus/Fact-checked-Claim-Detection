It was a link to a story entitled \"2014 Federal Retax will be postponed until October 2015.\" That would be too big if it were true. Really? The short answer is no. It was found that the article was published in September 2014 on a website called the National Report. Here's part of the article: \"Well, when you raise your taxes, whatever money is due to you is paid quickly. The process of recovering your money has been faster in recent years through the use of the electronic file and the direct deposit of federal tax credits. However, starting in 2015, the recovery of federal taxes for fiscal year 2014 will take more time for Americans to receive. It's a lot longer. \"Your federal tax deadline will remain April 15th, but under new directives issued to the IRS, This means that first filers who usually receive refunds at the beginning of February will have to wait an additional seven months longer than usual to obtain the money due to them. \"The White House Press Minister (Josh Ernest) has defended the upcoming changes in tax refund policy for the Tax Service. \"It's a simple cost-saving measure initiated by the administration with the support of both parties,\" said Ernest. The recommendation to start this new recovery structure came from the Commission on Ways and Means, under the leadership of Congressman David Camp of the Republic. Surely zero dollars will be retained, which is due to hard-working Americans. All you see here is a change in policy that simplifies the way the IRS repays taxes. Americans who find this unacceptable can always choose to make their tax deductions more consistent with the actual taxes they will owe in the future. On January 10, 2021, the distinguished fact-checkers were mentioned in the story of \"The Rebel Act - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" By Samantha Buterman: January 11, 2021, the article was quoted by two Republican senators critical of the movement -- Rand Paul of Kentucky and John McCain of Arizona. It seems a lot of people believe that. The article has been published 647 000 times on Facebook since it was published. The writer of a tax column, Forbes Kelly Phillips Earp, was among those who noticed its widespread reach. There's only one problem with the prosecution: it comes from a fake news site. The last time we verified a false allegation from the national report, the site had an acquittal, stating that \"the views expressed by the book on this site are their own and do not reflect the good journalistic and editorial integrity of the national report.\" Since then, this acquittal has been removed from the site. Another clearer declaration of acquittal - also removed - was maintained through the urban survey site Snopes.com. The author stated: \"The national report is a news publication and a political journalist on the Internet, which may or may not use real names, often in semi-real or largely false ways. All the news articles in the national report are fictional and supposedly false news. Any resemblance to the truth is pure coincidence.\" We've contacted the IRS several times to see if we can get official clearance from the agency, but we haven't heard a reply. Our ruling e-mail for series \"A\" was circulated with a link to an article entitled \"2014 Federal Retax will be postponed until October 2015.\" However, the article comes from the national report, an ironic web site. It is not accurate and was never meant to be. We assess the claim for fire pants.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07132"}
