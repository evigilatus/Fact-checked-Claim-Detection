Bush in 2001 and 2003. The host said to Bohner, \"You're talking about job creation. When the taxes were reduced under the Bush era in 2001, unemployment in the country was 4.5 per cent. Today it's 9%, just less than 10%. So why does Bush's period of tax cuts create jobs? Bohner replied that tax cuts \"have created about 8 million jobs over the first 10 years of their existence. We lost about 5 million of those jobs during this recession.\" Several readers suggested that we examine Bohner's statistics. So we did. Bohanner's statement actually has several problems. One is the question of whether tax cuts have already caused job growth; more so later. First, we'll point out something more fundamental -- that Bohanner's timeline is canceled. The first tax reduction was approved in June 2001, so we have not reached a full 10 years since the first reduction was issued, and the second round of reductions is only eight years old. We will give Bohner the most generous possible criteria - from the signing of the first tax reduction in June 2001 to the peak of employment before the contraction, which came in January 2008. (When we called Bohner's office, they confirmed that this was the comparison he was thinking about.) We have moved to data from the Bureau of Labour Statistics - specifically, figures from the current series of employment statistics, calculated using a broad survey of employer salary data. The figures are as follows: June 2001: 132,047,000 people are employed in January 2008: 137,996,000 people work an increase over the six-and-a-half-year period: 5,949,000 people, or approximately 6 million jobs - well below 8 million Pohner mentioned. Let us now turn to jobs that were lost during the recession. Once again, we calculated the figures in the most favourable way for Bohner - from the peak of employment (January 2008) to the lowest point (February 2010). These figures are: January 2008: 137,996,000 people work in February 2010: 129,246,000 people work in decline during almost the biennium: 8,750,000 people have lost, equivalent to approximately 9 million jobs - almost double what Bohner said today. What's going on? When we arrived at Bohner's office, spokesperson Michael Steele presented a different set of numbers -- the numbers we identified were from a different set of BLS statistics, known as the current population survey. The figures from the data of the Community Statistics Service are the result of a smaller survey of individuals and families. It is best known for producing the widely followed national unemployment rate, but the data also include an estimate of the initial number of working Americans, which was used by Bohner. The figures for the same periods as those considered above are as follows: June 2001: 136,873,000 persons were employed in January 2008: 146,407,000 persons were employed over six and a half years: 9,534,000 persons were employed in January 2008: 146,407,000 persons were employed in February 2010: 138,698,000 persons were employed over a period of approximately two years: 7,709,000 people were reduced until Bohner, using company employment figures, de facto underestimated the value of jobs created after Bush &apos; s tax cuts, instead of overestimating them. The number of jobs lost during the recession was closer to the CPS number than the CES number. In other words, using one set of data, Bohner is moving away, and using another, it is closer. What's up? For the periods studied, it appears that the different data sets have resulted in significant differences in the number of jobs created and lost. While both statisticians have advantages and disadvantages, the standard statistical classification figures \"usually prefer when talking about job growth or loss,\" as Stacy Standish, a BLS spokesman, said. And there's this problem: what if we use Bohner's number ten years instead of increasing the number of jobs for six and a half years? Over the full 10 years, employment has actually declined by more than 1 million jobs using the figures for the central civil service and has risen by 2.8 million according to the figures for the civil service. In both cases, both figures are significantly lower than Bohner &apos; s career gains for the full 10-year period. On January 13, 2021, the distinguished fact-checkers announced in a story in which General David H. Berger, commander of the United States Navy, said that Nancy Belusi's request for the use of marines for security purposes, saying \"We're not working for you.\" By Samantha Butterman on January 17, 2021, there are other concerns that go beyond statistics. While J.D. Foster, a senior colleague of the Conservative Heritage Foundation, said that he felt that both CSC and his company were good measures, and wondered whether Bohner had an excessive cause and effect on the sale. Foster said: \"The real issue is to show that Bush's tax reduction is \"creation of these jobs.\" \"Did the economy create any jobs during this period but for tax cuts?\" Gary Portless, an economist at work with the Brookings Central Foundation to Liberalism, argues that \"the most fundamental point is that under either of the two job profit measures, the relative increase in employment in the Bush administration after its initial tax reduction was relatively small. Blartels put together a comparison between the growth of jobs in presidential administrations over two periods in the corresponding period -- 81 months beginning in June after the inauguration of the President. George W. Bush has achieved fewer job gains than most modern administrations regardless of the employment measure used. Employment under Bush grew by 4.5 per cent using CSS and 7 per cent using CBS, while employment was increased by two numbers under Presidents Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan, as well as under Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford together for eight years, who ended the state of Nixon after his resignation, and John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson. The growth of jobs was slower than in George W. Bush, and even then, the situation was only using one of the BLS statistics. (Unpaid job growth during George H.W.'s administration was not compared to unpaid job growth. Bush or Jimmy Carter because they served only one period each.) Where does all this leave us? First, under the most common labour measurement standard - CS data - Boehner &apos; s claim is significantly exaggerated. Second, while Bohner is closer when using a different statistical, it is more accurate if he uses a much different period of time than he mentioned in the interview. Third, his suggestion that tax cuts are primarily responsible for subsequent job growth is controversial at best (it indicates that job growth is modest compared to previous administrations). Therefore, the figures given by Bohner are only accurate with significant modifications. In sum, his statements are very flawed to give her a higher rating than wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13110"}
