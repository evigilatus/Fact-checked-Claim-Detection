Lindsey Graham flip-flops on filling a Supreme Court vacancy in an election year", "text": "President Donald Trump is moving quickly to fill the Supreme Court vacancy created by the death of Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\nTrump can count on Sen. Lindsay Graham, R-S.C., chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, to move the nomination process along.\u00a0\n\"I will support President Donald Trump in any effort to move forward regarding the recent vacancy created by the passing of Justice Ginsburg,\" Graham tweeted Sept. 19, the day after Ginsburg\u2019s death.\nIn light of these two events, I will support President @realDonaldTrump in any effort to move forward regarding the recent vacancy created by the passing of Justice Ginsburg. #3\u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) September 19, 2020 \nGraham said he was doing this because Senate Democrats had aimed to derail the confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who prevailed on a 50-48 vote.\u00a0\n\"Chuck Schumer and his friends in the liberal media conspired to destroy the life of Brett Kavanaugh and hold that Supreme Court seat open,\" Graham wrote.\u00a0\nHe also faulted former Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., as the first to allow a simple majority \u2014 as opposed to a 60 vote supermajority \u2014 for circuit court appointments. Reid\u2019s 2013 decision eliminated the need to win at least some support from the minority party.\nIn Senate circles, this is called the nuclear option, because it eliminates the power of the filibuster. Republicans deployed the nuclear option in 2017 to block a Democratic filibuster and secure Neil Gorsuch\u2019s rise to the high court.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.
