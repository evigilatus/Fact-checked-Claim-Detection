William died in 1984. They\u2019re trying to steal this election,\" stated a Facebook post\u00a0by Ryan Fournier, founder of Students for Trump.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nScreengrabs on social media showed a Detroit registered voter, William Bradley, with a date of birth in March 1902 and a date of death in June 1984. We entered his name in the state\u2019s voter information website and found that he was listed as a registered voter. The state website showed that a ballot was sent to Bradley in September and received back Oct. 2.\nA city official said that no ballot was cast on behalf of the dead voter.\nWilliam Bradley is a potentially common name. We found another William Bradley in the same zip code and spoke to him on the telephone Nov. 5.\nBradley told us that he shares the same name as his father who died in 1984, except he has the middle name of Tarnell. He told us that he lives in the same home where his father used to live.\u00a0\nBradley told us that he voted by mail due to the pandemic. He said that a ballot arrived for his dead father, but he threw that out.\n\"I didn\u2019t use it, because I didn\u2019t want to get it confused with mine,\" he said.\nBradley said that someone on Nov. 5 called him and told him there was a report all over the internet about this situation, so he called the city about it. A city official told him not to worry, because officials check for a matching signature and date of birth, he told us.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Gateway Pundit\n\n\nstated on February 5, 2021 in an article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNewly discovered video shows late night deliveries of tens of thousands of illegal ballots 8 hours after deadline.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Clara Hendrickson \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe put Bradley\u2019s name with his date of birth through the same state website. It showed that he is a registered voter and it showed his application for an absentee ballot was received in July, but it showed no ballot sent or received.\u00a0\nDaniel Baxter, a consultant for the Detroit Department of Elections, sent us a statement that explained what happened:\n\"No ballot for the 118-year-old Mr. Bradley was ever requested, received or counted. A man with a nearly identical name requested a ballot and voted properly in both the primary and general elections.\u00a0 When his ballot was initially logged, however, it was incorrectly attributed to the William Bradley born 118 years ago through a clerical error.\"\u00a0\nTracy Wimmer, spokesperson for Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, told us that on rare occasions a ballot can be recorded inaccurately if names are identical, creating the impression that a ballot was cast in a dead voter\u2019s name.\n\"This can be because of voters with similar names, where the ballot is accidentally recorded as voted by John Smith Sr when it was actually voted by John Smith Jr; or because of inaccurately recorded birth dates in the qualified voter file; for example, someone born in 1990 accidentally recorded as born in 1890,\" Wimmer said. \"In such scenarios, no one ineligible has actually voted, and there is no impact on the outcome of the election. Local clerks can correct the issue when it is brought to their attention.\"\nWe have fact-checked many misleading claims about dead people on the voter rolls this year including in Detroit, Michigan, Virginia, Nevada and Wisconsin.\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post said \"118-year-old William Bradley voted via an absentee ballot in Wayne County, Michigan this year. William died in 1984. They\u2019re trying to steal this election.\"\nA city elections official said that no ballot was cast for the now deceased Bradley. The official said that a man with a nearly identical name (Bradley\u2019s son) voted in the election; however, when his ballot was initially logged it was incorrectly attributed to the William Bradley born 118 years ago. This was a clerical error, not voter fraud.\nThis statement rates False.\nPolitiFact researcher Caryn Baird contributed to this report.\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections FactChat #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click here, for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18463"}
