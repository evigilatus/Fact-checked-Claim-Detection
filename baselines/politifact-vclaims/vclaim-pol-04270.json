Recently, Hassan accused Ayotte of siding with billionaires Charles and David Koch while representing New Hampshire in the Washington.\n\"During her first four years in Washington, Sen. Ayotte voted with the Koch brothers nearly 90 percent of the time,\" Hassan said at a recent Democratic unity breakfast.\nIt\u2019s a line straight from one her ads that aired earlier this month.\nPolitifact decided to take a look.\nThe Koch brothers have become well known-names in politics. The men own Koch Industries, the Wichita, Kan.-based parent company of several manufacturers and energy companies, like paper maker Georgia-Pacific and refinery Flint Hill Resources.\nBut they have also waded in politics. The brothers\u2019 financial backing helped to found Americans for Prosperity, an advocacy group that has spent millions backing Republican candidates in New Hampshire and other states.\nThe brothers have never been elected members of Congress, nor have they ever cast a vote on the bills that came before Ayotte, a first-term U.S. senator elected in 2010.\nBut the Koch Brothers know how to let their positions be known. Through a collection of organizations funded with their own money and contributions from donors, they wield massive political influence.\nTheir funding and influence rivals the official Republican Party itself, and their aim is to \"fundamentally reshape American public life around a libertarian-infused brand of conservatism,\" according to Politico.\nHassan\u2019s camp pointed us to the flagship of the Koch brothers political network, Americans for Prosperity, and the organization\u2019s scorecard, which ranks lawmakers votes \"for economic freedom\" each session.\nAFP favors limited government, low taxes and less regulation. It ranks senators votes according to those stated goals, and picks votes for its scorecard that relate to federal spending, energy, entitlements and taxes, among other issues.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin Nunes\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in an interview on Fox\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRepublicans have no way to communicate\u201d after tech companies cut off Parler.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Amy Sherman \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAyotte received a 89 percent score from AFP in the 2011-2012 session after voting for bills \"to reduce spending back to 2008 fiscal year levels\" and to approve the Keystone XL pipeline and against a bill increasing taxes on oil and gas companies, according to the scorecard.\nAyotte received a 90 percent score from AFP for the 2013-2014 session.\nAveraged together, those scores would come to 89.5 percent, or rounded up to 90 percent, which Hassan claims.\nHassan\u2019s camp left out Ayotte\u2019s most recent score, from the 2015-2016 session, in which the Republican received a 70 percent rating from AFP.\nEven so, the scorecard isn\u2019t a vote-by-vote grade. It\u2019s not like AFP tallied the results of 100 votes and agreed with Ayotte 90 percent of the time. The organization scored her and all Senators on a sampling of votes in line with its agenda.\nMany other votes Ayotte took never registered on the scorecard and could have run afoul of the opinions of either Charles or David Koch.\nSo is it fair to equate the scorecard rank to voting \"with the Koch brothers,\" as Hassan says?\nAFP\u2019s Luke Hilgemann works with the group\u2019s \"federal affairs team,\" led by AFP Vice President of Government Affairs Brent Gardner and his staff, to pick votes that are included in the scorecard. \"No other parties are involved in that process,\" said spokesman Levi Russell, director of public affairs. \"Charles and David Koch do not play a role in developing the AFP scorecard.\"\nOur ruling\nHassan said Ayotte voted with the Koch brothers \"90 percent of the time\" during her first four years in Washington.\nAyotte earned a 90 percent rating during those years from an organizations the Koch brothers helped to found, Americans for Prosperity. But, the men don\u2019t vote in the U.S. Senate and the organization said the brothers don\u2019t play a direct role in choosing the votes.\nFurther, Hassan only cited Ayotte\u2019s first four years in office, ignoring her most recent grade.\nWe rate the claim Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04270"}
