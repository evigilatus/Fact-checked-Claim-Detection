The ads vary a bit, sometimes doubling up the targets, but all follow the same theme.\n\n\"Do you refuse to get a job? Looking for a free ride?\" a narrator asks in one of the ads. \"Well, Jim Sullivan says, Come to Wisconsin. No job? No problem! Don\u2019t pay taxes? Don\u2019t worry about it!\"\n\nThen comes the punch line:\n\n\"Jim Sullivan\u2019s been working hard to raise taxes on Wisconsin workers by another $510 a month so freeloaders can get free state-run health care.\"\n\nWhoa.\n\nFor some workers, that\u2019s a car payment or two worth of higher taxes every month. And \"freeloaders\" is, well, a pretty loaded word.\n\nSo, let\u2019s see what Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce is talking about.\n\nThe ads cite votes by the four Democrats for Senate Bill 40, which was the Senate version of the 2007-\u201909 state budget and included \"Healthy Wisconsin.\" The proposal would have provided health coverage to nearly all state residents.\n\nSenate Bill 40 died after being approved by the Senate. It faced opposition from Assembly Republicans and Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle, who said at the time he had to live in the \"real world\" of ideas that could become law.\n\nLet\u2019s examine the two parts of the major claim in the ads:\n\nThe Senate Democrat\u2019s plan would have raised \"taxes on Wisconsin workers by another $510 a month ...\"\n\nThe proposal was to be funded through a payroll tax. The average monthly cost would have been $370 for employers and $140 for employees, or a total of $510, according to the Senate Democrats\u2019 summary of the plan.\n\nWhen asked why the ads claim the full tax would have been picked up by workers, WMC policy analyst R.J. Pirlot told PolitiFact Wisconsin: \"It ultimately comes out of the worker\u2019s pocket.\"\n\nThat\u2019s one view of it. But clearly $510 per month would not have been deducted from paychecks, as the ads suggest.\n\nNow the second part.\n\n\" ... so freeloaders can get free state-run health care.\"\n\n\"Freeloaders\" means people who don\u2019t work, said WMC spokesman Jim Pugh.\n\nIndeed, WMC\u2019s ad against Jauch -- unlike the ones against Sullivan, Lehman and Kreitlow -- is explicit on that point.\n\nThat ad says \"Healthy Wisconsin\" was \"like ObamaCare, only worse. It would cost us $510 a month, but it\u2019s free for people who move here and refuse to work.\"\n\nIs that right? Only to a point.\n\n\"Healthy Wisconsin\" would have covered state residents and out-of-state residents working in Wisconsin, except those already covered by plans such as Medicare, Medicaid and BadgerCare, according to the state Legislative Fiscal Bureau.\n\nUnemployed people would have been eligible for health care under the proposal. So would new unemployed residents, after living in Wisconsin for one year -- although that waiting period would have been waived for pregnant women. \u00a0\n\nLet\u2019s punch the clock on this item.\n\nWith a focus on key state Senate seats, Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce is airing ads against four Democrats for their votes on a failed universal health care plan. Citing a $510 a month cost, the ads overstate how much the plan would have raised payroll taxes on workers. As for the second half of the charge -- that \"freeloaders\" would get free care -- unemployed Wisconsin residents would have qualified, as long as they\u2019d been state residents for at least a year.\n\nWe rate the claim as Half True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-14083"}
