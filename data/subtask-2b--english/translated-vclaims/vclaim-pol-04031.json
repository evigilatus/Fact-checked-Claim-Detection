The Republican presidential candidate did so again during a rally in Springfield, Ohio, on October 27. Tramp said that \"half of African-American children under the age of 6 live in extreme poverty.\" The poverty rate among African-American youth has been found to be disproportionately high, but not as high as Trump suggests. While the Trump campaign did not respond to a query about this article, we doubt that it encountered statistics in the State of America in Action report published by the Liberal Institute for Economic Policy. A graph with the report said, \"45.8 per cent of young black children (under 6 years of age) live in poverty, compared with 14.5 per cent of white children.\" If that were statistical at the moment, Trump would be on very solid ground. But it's not. It is not clear from geographic information, but the State of Work in America report was published in 2012. The same data are now six years old. The full text of the report states: \"In 2010, nearly half (45.8%) of young black children (under 6 years of age) were in poverty, compared with 14.5% of white children.\" The problem is that 2010 was during and immediately after the Great Depression, and thus poverty rates were unusually high. To figure out what the rates are now, we have moved to data from the United States Census Bureau and the Labour Statistics Office. The latest data we found related to children under five years of age and covered the year 2015. This varies slightly, but census data on poverty levels among children at age 6 do not change the percentage significantly. For African Americans under five years of age, the poverty rate was 37.4 per cent. This is slightly less than the \"almost half\" of African-American children cited by Trump. The percentage is even lower if you give weight to Trump's use of the term \"extreme poverty\" and look at the poorest of the poor - those with an income of half the poverty level or less. For African Americans under 5 years of age, this half of poverty rate is 20.4 per cent. This is beyond \"almost half.\" It should be noted that poverty levels among African Americans are already high compared to other racial and ethnic groups. Here is a summary of children under the age of 5: a group of fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story \"Trap refers to the rebellion law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" By Samantha Buterman: 11 January 2021 per cent at the poverty level, 37.4 per cent at the poverty level of half of Afro-Americans, 20.4 per cent of Spanish 30.2 per cent white 12.8 per cent, 8.4 per cent Asian 11.9 per cent 5.0 per cent Poverty rates were high, as Tramp says, at the depth of the Great Depression, but since then they have subsided to between 20 per cent and 37 per cent, depending on the income threshold they use. However, the rates for African-American children are disproportionately high, so Trump has a point even if his statistics are too old and extremely poor in that age group. Anyway, we're evaluating the statement half right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04031"}
