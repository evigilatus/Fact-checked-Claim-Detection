He replied that Saddam had used them against the Kurds and had nuclear reactors in the early 1980s. Thompson added, \"The Iraq Study Group reported that (Saddam) had designs on reviving his nuclear program, which he had started once upon a time.\"\n\nThe Iraq Study Group was a bipartisan panel created by Congress to recommend a better U.S. strategy in Iraq. The panel was headed by former Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Lee Hamilton, a former member of Congress who chaired the House Foreign Affairs Committee.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharlie Kirk\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Joe Biden admits he is governing like a 'dictator.'\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Daniel Funke \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn December 2006, the group released its report,\n\nThe Way Forward: A New Approach,\n\nwhich recommended a new U.S. strategy. The 142-page report focused on the future of Iraq and did not address whether Saddam wanted to restart a nuclear program. So we find Thompson's claim to be False.\n\n\nIt's possible that Thompson was referring to the Iraq Survey Group, a CIA panel that was formed to investigate whether there were weapons of mass destruction or the intent to produce WMDs in Saddam Hussein's Iraq. The report found that Saddam did not produce or possess any weapons of mass destruction for more than a decade before the U.S.-led invasion, but that he \"aspired to develop a nuclear capability \u2014 in an incremental fashion, irrespective of international pressure and the resulting economic risks.\"", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16578"}
