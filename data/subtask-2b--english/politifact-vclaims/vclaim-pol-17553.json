But, according to Morning Consult polling for the third quarter of 2019, he is also the most unpopular senator in the country among voters in his state.\n\"Elaine Chao BUSTED Sending $97 Million Contract To Help Mitch McConnell Win Reelection,\" says the headline, which also appeared on other websites and social media.\nThe headline linked to a video from The Ring of Fire show on YouTube, which elaborated on the claim, primarily by referring to a Dec. 17 Politico expose.\nWhat we found:\u00a0\nChao did get busted in the conversational sense of the word \u2014 her actions providing unusual help to Kentucky were exposed and they also drew criticism from a federal watchdog agency.\u00a0\nBut the claim significantly overstates the amount of the grant (not a contract). And even though it certainly gave McConnell something to crow about in his campaign, the grant occurred more than two years before voters will go to the polls in November 2020.\u00a0\u00a0\nKentucky county won big grant\nIn June 2018, the U.S. Department of Transportation gave a $67 million interstate highway improvement grant \u2014 not a $97 million contract \u2014 to Boone County.\u00a0\nThe county, Politico reported, is \"a rapidly growing suburban district of political importance\" to McConnell.\u00a0\nThe county was one of 26 grant winners out of 258 initial applicants.\nGrant process questioned\nIn June 2019, the Government Accountability Office, a top federal watchdog, faulted DOT in a report for failing to document why Boone County and 41 other grant applicants that had initially submitted incomplete applications were allowed to revise them, while 55 other applicants were not.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It really invites skepticism, and it raises questions about the integrity of the process and ultimately the decisions that are made,\" Susan Fleming, director of GAO's physical infrastructure team, told Politico. \"Are these decisions driven by merit? Or are they driven by other factors?\"\nCounty had an in\nBoone County officials were in contact with Chao\u2019s aide, Todd Inman, during the grant application process.\u00a0\nInman is a former McConnell campaign staffer.\n\"Chao\u2019s alleged favoritism toward Kentucky has become a focus of scrutiny following revelations that she had designated Inman as a special point-of-contact for Kentucky officials,\" the Politico article says.\u00a0\nThe DOT said the Inman communication was coincidental and that Boone County\u2019s application was among those \"best aligned\" with the grant criteria. In a later Fox News Radio interview, Chao dismissed the claims of favoritism as mere politics.\u00a0\nGrant tied to re-election\nAn earlier Politico article, in June 2019, revealed that Chao had designated Inman to help with grant applications and other priorities from Kentucky, \"paving the way for grants totaling at least $78 million for favored projects as McConnell prepared to campaign for reelection.\" Inman had stated in an email to McConnell\u2019s Senate office that Chao had personally asked him to serve as an intermediary \"on grants with special significance for McConnell.\"\nMcConnell dismissed that report at the time, suggesting at a news conference that he had discussed federal projects with Chao and that she hadn\u2019t steered enough funds to his state. \"You know, I was complaining to her just last night: 169 projects, and Kentucky got only five. I hope we\u2019ll do a lot better next year,\" McConnell said.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that McConnell announced his re-election bid in August 2018 \u2014 two months after the grant was announced, but more than two years ahead of the 2020 election.\nOur ruling\nA social media post claimed: \"Elaine Chao BUSTED Sending $97 Million Contract To Help Mitch McConnell Win Reelection.\"\nChao\u2019s agency gave a Kentucky county a $67 million grant, not a $97 million contract, so the amount claimed is overstated by nearly half.\nChao was \"busted,\" in the colloquial sense of the word, in that it was revealed that the county had initially submitted an incomplete grant application, but eventually won the funds after consulting with an aide to Chao \u2014 who formerly worked on McConnell\u2019s campaign. The process also drew criticism from the Government Accountability Office.\nThe grant helped McConnell\u2019s re-election bid in that it is the largest transportation grant received in Kentucky during the Trump administration. Voters could view that favorably come Election Day.\nThe statement is partially accurate, our definition of Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17553"}
