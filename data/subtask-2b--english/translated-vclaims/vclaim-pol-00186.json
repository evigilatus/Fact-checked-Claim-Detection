Pic.twitter.com/Veft20cxd - Tom Reed (@RepTomRed) 20 August 2019 permanently reduced the corporate tax rate to 21% and introduced changes to business tax cuts. With regard to individual filers, the law has increased the standard discount and child credit with the abolition of personal exemptions, among other changes, such as a maximum State and local tax deduction of $10,000. It is true that the average wage of workers has increased and the unemployment rate is declining. But Red passed the tax cuts and jobs act. He's responsible for economic gain. We asked Reid's office about the link. Reed's spokesman didn't deny that he had such a relationship, nor did he provide proof of a connection between them. We wondered whether, as Red suggested, the Federal Tax Code was responsible for increasing the wages of American workers and reducing unemployment. The United States Bureau of Labour Statistics stated that the average wage of workers had risen by 3.7 per cent in July 2019 over the past year. When inflation was calculated, wage growth was 2 per cent during the same period. Will Rainerert, Red's spokesman, referred to these data, and the economists we talked to described it as the most reliable data on the subject. Many economists said that Red &apos; s claim about wage growth was true, although to obtain a true picture of the quality of wages that remained before inflation, inflation must be part of the calculation. But just because inflation is not taken into account, it does not make Reed's claim false, as Benjamin Paige, a senior colleague in the Centre for Tax Policy, a non-partisan think tank. With regard to unemployment, the United States Bureau of Labour Statistics reported as of 2 August that the unemployment rate in July 2019 was 3.7 per cent. Historical data from the Bureau of Labour Statistics show that the overall unemployment rate has declined since the 10 per cent rise in October 2009. Back in 1948, the unemployment rate was lower than the current 3.7 per cent in the late 1960s but also in the 1950s and 1948s. The effect of the tax code Reed Gridd: \"Our economy thrives after tax cuts.\" But is it booming because of tax cuts? On January 16, 2021, Jordan Rachel stated in Tweedda that the minimum wage of $15 per hour would raise the price of taco bill burrito to $38. \u2022 On January 20, 2012, in May, the Congressional Non-Party Research Department said that the effects were minimal. \"In general, the effects of growth tend to show a relatively small (if any) effect in the first year on the economy,\" by analysts. \"although the study of growth rates cannot indicate the effects of tax cuts on GDP, it tends to exclude very large effects in the near term.\" On wages, analysts found that \"regular workers have very little growth in wage rates.\" We also interviewed four economists about Red's allegations. The Centre for Tax Policy stated on the page that the tax law had had some impact, although unemployment and wage growth were consistent with historical trends. Since 2015, two years before the promulgation of the Act, average weekly income has been growing at an average rate of 3 per cent. He said, \"It's not something that happened all of a sudden.\" Leonard Borman, a professor at Syracuse University and former Deputy Assistant Minister for Tax Analysis of the Treasury, said that the tax law and the expenditure increases of Trump had mainly strengthened the economy by increasing household income, but economists \"cannot accurately measure the current effects of tax reduction compared with many other important factors.\" \"The main explanation for the statistics mentioned by Congressman Reed is that we are at the peak of the business cycle,\" said Borman. Neil Rao, an assistant professor at the Department of Economics at Buffalo University, said that Red's claims had \"a basis in fact,\" but \"not the whole story.\" Rao said that there was no strong evidence linking what was happening in the labour market to the Law on Tax Reductions and Jobs. As the data of the Bureau of Labour Statistics show, unemployment was in a downward trend prior to the entry into force of the tax reform package. Aparna Mathur, an economic policy scientist at the American Institute of Entrepreneurship, agreed that wages were rising nominally by 3 per cent per year and that unemployment rates were at historically low levels, but there was insufficient evidence that the tax reform package had anything to do with it. \"If you look at the trend in average wages and employment before and after December 2017, there is no indication that the Teaks and Jobs Cutting Act has had an impact on this trend,\" Mathur said. Both unemployment and wages had been \"smoothly ending\" well before the adoption of tax legislation. After tax cuts, Reid said, unemployment is at a record level, and the average wage of workers rises by more than 3 per cent. This is not controversial, with the warning that unemployment was lower in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s. But it points out that because of tax cuts, that's not the case, according to the non-partisan research department in Congress and the economists we talked to. This was the case before the enactment of the law in 2017. His statement is partially accurate. Economic gains have been made. But it takes things out of context when it fails to mention economists and a non-partisan Congressional research report indicates that tax cuts did not have much to do with it. We're assessing Reed's claim half right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00186"}
