The No on Prop 64 campaign was ordered to change claims similar to Feinstein\u2019s statement at the center of this fact check. Claims such as \"marijuana smoking ads will be legal on all broadcast primetime shows\" were dialed back to \"could be allowed.\" On the Yes on 64 side, however, the judge ruled there should be \"No change\" to that campaign\u2019s statement that \"Nothing in 64 makes it legal to show marijuana ads on TV. Federal law prohibits it!\" We continue to view Feinstein\u2019s claim that Prop 64 \"allows\" recreational marijuana ads on TV as misleading. Had the senator said Prop 64 could open the door, someday, to recreational marijuana ads on TV, that might have been accurate. We continue to rate her statement Mostly False.\nCalifornians will decide in November whether to legalize recreational marijuana through Proposition 64, a much-debated measure on the state\u2019s ballot.\nU.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein, D-CA, who opposes Prop 64, says a green light for the initiative could strip away advertising rules and dramatically change what\u2019s seen on TV.\nProp 64 \"allows marijuana smoking ads in prime time, on programs with millions of children and teenage viewers,\" Feinstein said on July 12, 2016, in a No On Prop. 64 campaign press release.\nWe know Prop 64 would allow Californians to legally smoke pot in their homes, yards and possibly in designated shops where it\u2019s sold and regulated.\nBut would it also lead to marijuana ads on \"prime time\" TV? Or is Feinstein blowing smoke? We decided to fact-check the senator\u2019s statement.\nHalf-baked claim?\nProp 64 is backed by Democratic California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom and the California Democratic Party. Recreational marijuana is already legal in Colorado, Washington, Alaska, Oregon and Washington D.C. Several states in addition to California are set to decide on legalizing pot in November.\nFeinstein\u2019s office did not expand on her statement. Instead, it referred us to the No On Prop. 64 campaign.\nThe campaign pointed us to Prop 64\u2019s chapter on advertising and marketing restrictions, specifically Section 26151.\nIt states: \"Any advertising or marketing placed in broadcast, cable, radio, print and digital communications shall only be displayed where at least 71.6 percent of the audience is reasonably expected to be 21 years of age or older, as determined by reliable, up-to-date audience composition data.\"\nWayne Johnson, spokesman for No On Prop. 64, said the 71.6 percent threshold is so low that only a few shows, such as Saturday morning cartoons, would be prohibited from airing marijuana ads.\n\"It\u2019s a ridiculous standard,\" Johnson said. \"It only applies to the tiniest handful of shows.\"\n\nIn this photo taken on Thursday, May 26, 2016, Sarah Seiter, curator of the exhibit \"Altered State: Marijuana in California\" handles a cannabis leaf with gloved hands at the Oakland Museum in Oakland, Calif. \u00a0Ben Margot / AP\nClaim ignores federal law\nTV and legal experts say Feinstein\u2019s statement ignores federal law, which classifies marijuana as an illegal drug and prohibits advertising it on television.\n\"If Prop 64 passes, nothing will change in terms of what radio and television stations can legally broadcast,\" said Joe Berry, president of the California Broadcasters Association. \"The federal government licenses the radio and TV stations in California. The federal government\u2019s position is that marijuana is an illegal substance. So, it\u2019s illegal to advertise that substance.\"\nBerry added: \"The stations themselves are federally licensed. So, there is a risk to the license for the station at license renewal.\"\nExperts said cable and satellite television services would likely be subject to similar restrictions.\nThey point to Section 843 of the Controlled Substances Act, which specifically prohibits using \"communications facilities\" to transmit advertisements for the sale of Schedule I drugs, which includes marijuana, heroin and ecstasy, among others. The law was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Nixon in 1970.\nIt defines \"communications facilities\" as any and all public and private instrumentalities used or useful in the transmission of writing, signs, signals, pictures, or sounds of all kinds and includes mail, telephone, wire, radio, and all other means of communication.\"\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin Nunes\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in an interview on Fox\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRepublicans have no way to communicate\u201d after tech companies cut off Parler.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Amy Sherman \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarijuana leaf (AP photo)\nLegality a cloudy issue\nOthers say the legality of advertising marijuana on television -- particularly in states that have legalized the drug -- remains cloudy, at best.\n\"There is no (Federal Communications Commission) rule that prohibits such advertisements in states with legalized cannabis,\" Kathleen Kirby, a media lawyer based in Washington D.C., told PolitiFact California in an email.\nA spokeswoman at the FCC could not point us to one, and declined to elaborate on the subject.\nKirby said several of her clients in states where pot is legal have been approached to run marijuana advertisements.\n\"I don\u2019t say no, but I counsel,\" regarding the lack of clarity, Kirby told the American Bar Association in an online article.\nKirby noted in the December 2015 article that all of her clients had decided to hold off on the ads.\nShe added in her email to PolitiFact California that federal law \"would need to change to make accepting such ads risk free. The feds have more or less signaled that they will look the other way, but you never know with changes in administration or even changes in federal prosecutors.\"\nNo TV ads in other states\nIn recent years, federal drug enforcement authorities have taken a \u2018hands-off\u2019 approach on the sale and cultivation of marijuana in states that have legalized and regulated the drug. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they\u2019ll look the other way on federal advertising rules, said Douglas Berman, a law professor at Ohio State University and editor of the Marijuana Law, Policy and Reform blog.\nA local TV station in Colorado had planned to run the nation\u2019s first marijuana TV advertisement in 2015, but backed away over concerns about federal rules.\nStations have yet to air any marijuana ads on television, Berman said.\nThose ads would be treated \"from a federal regulatory perspective as equivalent to if you were broadcasting (ads for) heroin,\" the law professor added.\nThe Yes on Proposition 64 campaign filed a lawsuit in Sacramento Superior Court in early August demanding what they described as \"false and/or misleading statements\" -- including the claim about marijuana ads on TV at the center of this fact check -- be removed from the official ballot arguments submitted by the measure\u2019s opponents.\nEfforts to change federal law are underway. But it\u2019s unclear if, when and how much the law will change.\nBerman said California\u2019s provisions, if approved through Prop 64, could pave the way for advertising on TV, but only if the federal rules change first.\n\"It ain\u2019t happening anytime soon,\" he said. \"Certainly, it\u2019s not something that\u2019s going to automatically happen based on how California votes this fall.\"\nOur ruling\nCalifornia Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein recently said the state\u2019s pot legalization initiative \"allows marijuana smoking ads in prime time, on programs with millions of children and teenage viewers.\"\nProposition 64 includes a provision that marijuana advertisements \"shall only be displayed where at least 71.6 percent of the audience is reasonably expected to be 21 years of age or older.\"\nIf Feinstein had said Prop 64 helps pave the way for marijuana ads on TV, that might have been accurate.\nBut experts say Feinstein\u2019s claim, as she stated it, is misleading. The federal Controlled Substances Act bans TV stations from advertising illegal substances, including marijuana.\nThere\u2019s an element of truth to Feinstein\u2019s statement: The FCC doesn\u2019t have a rule expressly prohibiting marijuana television ads in states that legalize the drug. And federal authorities could choose to ignore the Controlled Substances Act.\nStill, the experts we spoke with say California\u2019s Prop 64 will not lift the legal cloud of uncertainty by itself. Feinstein\u2019s statement goes too far.\nWe rate her claim\u00a0Mostly False.\n\nMOSTLY FALSE\u00a0\u2013 The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.\nClick here for\u00a0more\u00a0on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/1410625c-ab69-4d14-a425-bba2b4ac9a26", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04525"}
