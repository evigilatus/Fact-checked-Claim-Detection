One claim about North Carolina and Wisconsin is that the number of votes in each of those states was higher than the number of registered voters.\u00a0\nOne Facebook post says, \"How is this possible?\" with a chart showing that in North Carolina, 5,160,000 people are registered to vote and 5,387,496 people cast votes there, for a turnout rate of 104.41%; and in Wisconsin, 3,129,000 people are registered to vote and 3,240,275 people cast ballots there, for a turnout rate of 103.56%.\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.
