Biden answered a question from Mieke Haeck, who said she has an 8-year-old daughter who is transgender.\u00a0\nBiden does not state that he supports sex changes for children. He states opposition to transgender discrimination.\u00a0\nHaeck: \"The Trump administration has attacked the rights of transgender people, banning them from military service, weakening non-discrimination protections, and even removing the word transgender from some government websites. How will you, as president, reverse this dangerous and discriminatory agenda and ensure that the lives and rights of LGBTQ people are protected under U.S. law?\"\nBiden: \"I will flat out just change the law. Eliminate those executive orders, number one. ... My dad was a high school-educated, well-read man who was a really decent guy. And I was being dropped off to get an application in the center of our city, Wilmington, Delaware, the corporate capital of the world at the time. And these two men \u2014\u00a0 I\u2019m getting out to get an application to be a lifeguard in the African-American community, because there was a big swimming pool complex.\n\"And these two men, well-dressed, leaned up and hugged one another and kissed one another. I\u2019m getting out of the car at the light, and I turned to my dad. My dad looked at me. He said, \u2018Joey, it\u2019s simple. They love each other.\u2019 The idea that an 8-year-old child or a 10-year-old child decides, \u2018You know, I decided I want to be transgender. That\u2019s what I think I\u2019d like to be. It\u2019d make my life a lot easier.\u2019 There should be zero discrimination. And what\u2019s happening is too many transgender women of color are being murdered. They\u2019re being murdered. I think it\u2019s up to, now, 17. Don\u2019t hold me to that number, but it\u2019s higher now?\"\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlenn Grothman\n\n\nstated on September 28, 2012 in a news release\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Tammy Baldwin introduced a bill that would require doctors and other health care workers to ask patients, \"including young children, whether they are gay, lesbian, bisexual, or if they know their gender identity.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 October 23, 2012\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHaeck: \"Yeah.\"\nBiden: \"And that\u2019s just this year.

Your daughter, that your other daughter has a right to be and do. None. Zero. And by the way, my son Beau, who passed away, was the attorney general of the state of Delaware. He was the guy who got the first transgender law passed in the state of Delaware. And because of a young man who became a woman, who worked for him in the attorney general's office.\"\nAmerican Principles Project spokesman Paul Dupont argued to PolitiFact that \"implied in the assertion that there should be zero discrimination\" is that children should \"have access to any medical treatments that will facilitate\" a sex change. But Biden made no such statement.\nDupont also cited Biden\u2019s support of the federal Equality Act. But that measure would prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in employment, education and public accommodations.\nOn his campaign website, Biden criticizes the Trump administration\u2019s decision to block the ability of transgender individuals to openly serve in the military. That section does not mention children.\u00a0\nBiden\u2019s campaign did not reply to our requests for information.\nOur ruling\nAmerican Principles Project claimed: \"Joe Biden says he supports sex changes for kids.\"\nBiden has stated opposition to discrimination against transgender people, he has not said he supports for sex changes for children.\nWe rate the statement False.\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click\u00a0here, for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18781"}
