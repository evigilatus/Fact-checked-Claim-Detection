The quote cannot be found in any interviews or books and only appears to exist in the form of memes and social media posts. Other fact-checking websites have also been unable to locate the statement outside of social media.\nMary Anne Trump passed away in 2000, and if she had said such an inflammatory statement about her son, it would have likely come up in the news cycle during his 2016 presidential campaign.\u00a0\nThere is no credible evidence to suggest this quote is real.
