Hundreds of them.\nA now-deleted Instagram post by an account called \"Barstoolnewsnet\" featured what appears to be a screenshot of a news broadcast reporting \"BREAKING NEWS\" that Russia \"unleashed more than 500 lions on its streets to ensure that people are staying indoors during this pandemic outbreak.\"\u00a0\n\nBelow that a news ticker says, \"Vladmir (sic) Putin released around 500 lions to make people stay indoors.\" Several similar versions of the post have also been shared on Facebook.\u00a0\nBut none of it is true.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 25, 2021 in a blog post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWHO now saying you do not need to wear a mask.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

But Russian President Vladimir Putin hasn\u2019t threatened people with five years\u2019 jail time for violating stay-at-home orders, as some posts claim. And he hasn\u2019t released lions, tigers or bears to keep people home during the pandemic. The broadcast screenshot was made on a news generator website, and the photo of the lion is from a 2016 movie shoot in South Africa, not Russia.\nWe searched for the source of the image and came across the news generator website \"Break Your Own News,\" which allows people to create their own television chyrons. The generator\u2019s configuration is identical to the screenshot in the social media posts, and Check Your Fact reported it found the website\u2019s watermark on one of the postings.\nA reverse-image search showed that the photo of the lion is from an April 2016 movie shoot in Johannesburg. The lion (his name is Columbus) had reportedly been borrowed from a nearby lion park for the filming, and the area was fenced off.\u00a0\nLions have not been tapped by Russia to enforce stay-at-home recommendations.
