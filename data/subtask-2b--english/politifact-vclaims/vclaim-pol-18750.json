He and his wife, Jill, a teacher and professor, reported adjusted gross income of just under $400,000 on their joint tax return form in 2016.\nIn the years that followed, though, their adjusted gross income ballooned: to about $11 million in 2017, plus another $5.6 million over 2018 and 2019.\nThe change intrigued social media users. One Facebook post says, \"Joe & Jill Biden\u2019s income went from $396,456 in 2016, to $16,596,979 in 2017-2019. Anyone else want to know where that money is coming from?\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It\u2019s among several posts that have tried to raise questions about the sources of the Bidens\u2019 wealth.\nThe post compares a one-year income figure to a combined three years, inflating the difference somewhat. But the figures themselves are right on the money: The Bidens reported earning $396,456 in 2016 and a total of $16,596,979 from 2017 to 2019 \u2014 which includes $11,031,309 in 2017; $4,580,437 in 2018; and $985,233 in 2019.\nBut the big mystery postulated in the claim \u2014 \"Anyone else want to know where that money is coming from?\" \u2014 is not such a big mystery. Many of the answers are detailed in the tax documents the Bidens have made public, which make clear that their big income gain for those years came mostly from fees for speaking engagements and book deals.\nMost of Joe Biden\u2019s paid speeches from late 2017 through mid-2018 were part of a tour promoting his November 2017 book \"Promise Me, Dad,\" a New York Times bestseller about the loss of his son Beau to brain cancer.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiden\u2019s book-tour events brought income ranging from a low of $8,000 to one \"VIP experience\" that commanded nearly $235,000 and included preferential seating and a reception, according to his presidential financial disclosure form. Biden earned a total of $1.8 million from 30 book tour events, based on the disclosure. The book sold more than 300,000 copies, Forbes reported.\u00a0\n\"Promise Me, Dad\" was part of a deal Biden struck with Flatiron Books to write two non-fiction works as well as a third book with Jill Biden, according to Publishers Weekly, which reported that the three-book deal was worth $8 million.\nBesides his book tour, Biden participated in events such as the MPSF Speaker Series in California, where he delivered four speeches around the state for a total of about $500,000, according to the financial disclosure. From late 2017 through July 2019, he had 19 speaking engagements that earned him a total of $2.4 million, the disclosure says.\nThe Bidens\u2019 sources of income from 2017 through summer 2019 also included Jill Biden\u2019s speaking engagements, which brought in about $700,000, and Joe Biden\u2019s job as a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, which paid an annual salary of $540,484, according to the disclosure.\u00a0\nThe money the Bidens earned from book deals and speaking engagements was routed through two S corporations they formed, CelticCapri Corp. and Giacoppa Corp. In his 2019 presidential financial disclosure form, Joe Biden lists $425,000 in salary and $2.8 million in a distributive share from CelticCapri.\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post says Joe and Jill Biden\u2019s income jumped from $396,456 in 2016 to a combined $16,596,979 in 2017-2019, and asks \"Anyone else want to know where that money is coming from?\"\nThe suggestion that the Bidens\u2019 income sources are unknown is misleading. They are substantially explained on the tax returns and financial disclosures that the Bidens made public. Those documents show that the Bidens\u2019 increased income from 2017 to 2019 came mostly from speaking engagements and book deals.\nThis claim takes the Bidens\u2019 reported incomes from 2016-2019 out of context.
