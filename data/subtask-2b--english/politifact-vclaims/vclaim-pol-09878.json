We strapped on our hip boots, and waded on in.\n\nGreat Lakes experts are quick to point out that Lake Erie is particularly susceptible to pollution from farms, factories and humans because it is both the most shallow and most fish-filled of the five major lakes that that straddle the United States border with Canada.\n\nBut amid the various contaminants, what emerges as the biggest threat to the health of the lake?\n\nThe foremost expert on Lake Erie\u2019s water quality is David Baker, the director emeritus of the National Center for Water Quality Research at Heidelberg College in Tiffin, who has studied the waters of Lake Erie for nearly 40 years.\n\nThe biggest threat to the health of the lake has come from toxic blue green algae which has appeared in recent years \u2014 most noticeably in 2011\u2014 and can turn a thriving aquaculture into a marine dead zone, according to Baker.\n\n\"I would say that the blue green algae is the biggest problem that affects the Lake and the health of the water,\" Baker said. \"The bulk of the evidence\u2014and the widespread scientific assessment \u2014 is that the dissolved phosphorus from agricultural runoff is the primary source of the problem.\"\n\nAgricultural runoff is funneled into Lake Erie when it washes away after fierce storms, and comes more from the Maumee River near Toledo than any other place, Baker said.\n\nAnd while Detroit does have a massive \u2014 and somewhat antiquated \u2014 wastewater treatment plant serving 76 communities that dumps sewage into the Lake, Baker said the algae problems did not come from Michigan.\n\n\"We can look at pictures from satellite photos that show us this pretty clearly--we just don\u2019t see big blooms of algae moving down the Detroit River,\" Baker said.\n\nA particularly dry spring 2012 \u2014 just a year after the worst algae blooms on record in Lake Erie \u2014 further proved this point as the blue-green algae blooms were mostly absent with no agricultural runoff after storms to feed it, according to Baker.\n\n\"In a way, last year was a great experiment, and we got to see the Lake respond rather quickly to what the loading was from the agricultural watershed,\" Baker said. \"We just did not see the widespread blue green algae blooms problem in 2012.\"\n\nBaker said that problems with waste from Detroit being dumped into the Lake Erie were \"very minor\" because the phosphorus loads from wastewater remain relatively constant over time and are relatively diluted compared to the agricultural runoff that can funnel in after a storm. \"Things are always a little bit more complicated than what can be summarized by a governor,\" Baker said.\n\nLargely agreeing with Baker was Kristy Meyer, director of Agricultural and Clean Water Programs for the Ohio Environmental Council. Meyer said agricultural runoff is the top issue for Lake Erie, not waste from Michigan, because it accounts for nearly half the phosphorus dumped into the Lake.\n\n\"It\u2019s always nice to have a finger to point, and why not point the finger somewhere else?\" Meyer said. She did say that both are \"big problems\" in her view.\n\nBacking the governor\u2019s statement was Sandy Bihn, executive director of Lake Erie Waterkeeper Inc., a non-profit advocacy and education group focused on trying to improve Lake Erie\u2019s water quality.\n\nBihn said she agreed with the governor\u2019s characterization that Detroit sewage was a big problem noting that thousands of tons of sewage sludge were dumped into the Detroit and Rouge Rivers in recent years. \"What he said is a true statement,\" she said. \"When five percent of the phosphorous is coming from one place, that is something we need to be focused on.\"\n\nProblems with sewage being dumped into Lake Erie from Michigan grew worse in the last several years when equipment began to degrade and Detroit\u2019s government couldn\u2019t afford to fix or replace it, Bihn said. She credited the Kasich administration with pressing Michigan officials for action on the issue of the phosphorus flowing from the wastewater treatment plant in Detroit.\n\nSo where does that leave us?\n\nAs he was talking to reporters about improving water quality at Grand Lake St. Marys, Kasich praised farmers for doing more to limit agricultural runoff. Turning to Lake Erie, Kasich blamed Michigan for \"dumping sewage\" into the Lake that causes \"big problems.\"\n\nKasich\u2019s statement was partially accurate. Sewage from Detroit is being dumped into Lake Erie and it does certainly contribute to water quality problems in the Lake.\n\nBut there are important details needed to fully understand the claim.\n\nAgricultural runoff is the biggest problem facing the shallowest of the Great Lakes as it causes toxic algae blooms, according to the foremost Lake Erie water quality expert. He called the impact of Detroit\u2019s waste floating into the lake \"very minor.\" Other Lake Erie water experts, though, seemed a bit more concerned about the impact of the Detroit waste in the overall mix.\n\nBut by praising farmers for limiting pollution being dumped into waterways and then blaming Michigan in the next breath for wastewater from Detroit funneling into the Lake, Kasich\u2019s claim downplayed the impact of agricultural runoff in the lake. That impact is an important detail needed to put the governor\u2019s claim in context.\n\nOn the Truth-O-Meter, the governor\u2019s claim rates Half True. \u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09878"}
