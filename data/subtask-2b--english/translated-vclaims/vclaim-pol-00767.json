There are two bills submitted in the Councils of the States and the Senate that will impose new penalties on persons who illegally supply controlled substances to a person who has died as a result of taking them. The idea is controversial. Some believe that it would prevent people from calling 911 if someone they know was overdosed, and many local media reported it. However, the majority leader of the Senate, Harry Brown, a Republican of Jacksonville who co-sponsored a bill, promoted it on 9 April in the Senate Judicial Committee. \"North Carolina last year was the second in the nation in overdose deaths,\" Brown told the Committee in opening remarks. Overdose mortality rates have increased in recent years with the use of medical painkillers and street drugs by Americans, such as heroin. The states of Apalashian are among the most affected. According to the former North Carolina Polyte Fact, statistics have at one time shown that four North Carolinans die on average from an overdose every day. The PolicFact NC knows that there is a problem, and we will not rule on whether or not the bill is justified. However, we wondered whether Brown &apos; s claim regarding the North Carolina arrangement was correct. Turns out he's cut off. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a federal government agency, is the leading authority in the field of mortality in America. According to the latest data of the Centre for Disease Control, which analysed statistics in 2017, North Carolina is not even in the top 10 states with the highest drug overdose mortality rate. In that year, North Carolina had the 19 highest drug overdose mortality rates in the country and 10 highest overdose deaths. West Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and New Hampshire had the highest drug overdose mortality rates in the country. Pennsylvania, Ohio, Florida, California and New York were the highest drug overdose deaths. On January 26, 2021, in the North Carolina tweet, Secretary of State Ellen Marshall, Jenna Woodsworth stated, \"She has won state-wide races more than anyone else is likely to be alive.\" \u2022 1 February 2021: Kaiser Foundation for the Family, a health research organization, which uses data from the Centre for Disease Control and the National Centre for Health Statistics to track deaths with an overdose of opiates, specifically. Like the CDC, the latest information provided by Kaiser dates back to 2017. In that year, North Carolina was not among the 10 states with the highest mortality rates from opioids or the total number of overdose deaths. The Forum reported that North Carolina in 2017 had the highest Opiates overdose mortality rate in the country and the highest overdose rate of 20 of all drugs (not just opiates). What Brown, who Paulette Fuckett called, said was wrong to speak. He meant to say, \"In 2017, North Carolina was the second-highest excess mortality increase in the country,\" said in e-mail, with emphasis on increasing the word. Brown cited the story of the Charlotte-based WFAE radio station - \"Higher drug overdose mortality rate by NC the second highest rate in the United States\" - as its source. Various media outlets, including the News and Surveillance Bulletin, reported that the CDC predicted in August 2018 that data for 2017 would show North Carolina had the second highest increase in drug overdose deaths in that year. The CDC often reports provisional (or projected) data before finalizing the updated data. In the case of North Carolina this time, the predictions proved to be a little strange. The CDC report on the full figures for 2017 found that NC had the fourth highest increase in drug overdose deaths between the 2016-2017 calendar year. (The 2017 Caesar &apos; s review also found that NC had the fourth highest increase in drug overdose deaths, as well as deaths from opioid overdose). The latest data of the CDC paints a more kindergarten image of North Carolina. Again using limited data, the Agency reports that NC is not among the states that reported the highest overdose deaths or the largest increase in deaths between August 2017 and August 2018. The CDC web page, \"Number of deaths with a temporary drug overdose,\" shows the change in percentage (increase or decrease) in reported drug overdose deaths between August 2017 and August 2018. The report shows that Nebraska, Kansas, Louisiana, Delaware and Hawaii are the states with the largest increases in drug overdose deaths. To promote a controversial bill, Brown told North Carolina last year he was the second in the nation in overdose deaths. That's not true, Brown said he misspoked. But even what he meant to say - that NC was the second largest increase in total drug deaths - was based on an outdated situation. We assess his claim is wrong.
