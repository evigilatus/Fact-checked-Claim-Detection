Jordan in the role of 22-year-old Oscar Grant, who was shot and killed by a police officer on an Oakland train platform on Jan. 1, 2009. The photo from the movie shows Jordan sitting down with his hands raised.\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Hours after his resignation, protesters marched and rioters smashed storefronts in downtown Oakland while demanding the district attorney in Alameda County, where Oakland is the county seat, file a murder charge against Mehserle. The district attorney at the time was Tom Orloff, not Kamala Harris.\u00a0\nTwo weeks after the shooting, Orloff charged Mehserle with murder. His trial began in June 2010. David Stein was the prosecutor for the district attorney\u2019s office who tried the case.\u00a0\nOn July 8 of that year, the jury convicted Mehserle of involuntary manslaughter, suggesting that jurors believed Mehserle\u2019s defense that he intended to tase Grant, not shoot him. They also convicted him of \"intentionally\" firing a gun, though a judge later threw that conviction out. Mehserle was sentenced to a minimum of two years in custody but with credit for time served, he was eligible for release about seven months later.\nHarris isn\u2019t named in the Chronicle\u2019s story, which ran less than a month before she declared her candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination. As a high-profile U.S. senator, her connection to the case would draw attention in an article on the 10-year anniversary of Grant\u2019s death.\u00a0\nAccording to a biography of Harris on California\u2019s justice department website, she joined the Alameda County DA\u2019s office in 1990 after graduating from law school. She worked there until 1998, prosecuting child sexual assault, homicide and robbery cases, before leaving to work in the San Francisco district attorney\u2019s office.\u00a0\nIn 2004, she started her tenure as the first woman district attorney in San Francisco, according to the bio, a post she held until 2010. In January 2011, she became the 32nd attorney general of California.\nWe rate this Facebook post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17119"}
