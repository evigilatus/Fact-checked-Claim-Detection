The text above reads: \"Child dies in 3 countries of corona virus.\"\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nIt was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\n\nThe photo depicts Vitor Rafael Bastos Godinho, a 14-year-old Portuguese boy who died at the end of March after testing positive for the novel coronavirus. The Portuguese newspaper Record wrote about his death.\u00a0\nOther news outlets also reported on Godinho\u2019s death and correctly identified him, including the United Kingdom\u2019s Daily Mail, whose article appears in the center of the collage.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMasks have negative impacts on 68% of children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jon Greenberg \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Daily Express, another U.K. outlet in the collage, wrote about a 12-year-old girl who died from COVID-19 in Belgium. That story includes Godinho\u2019s photo, but not in connection with the girl. It includes his photo in a reference to another young person who died from the virus and correctly identifies him in the caption.\nLastly, an article by the U.K.\u2019s Daily Record that appears in the Facebook post didn\u2019t use Godinho\u2019s photo at all.\u00a0\nThat March 31 story covered the death of a 13-year-old boy, Ismail Mohaemd Abdulwahab, from the U.K. There is no photo of any child in the article.\nIt\u2019s unclear where the screenshot combining Godinho\u2019s photo and Abdulwahab\u2019s name originated. We couldn\u2019t find its source.\nGodinho\u2019s photo does turn up in image searches on the Abdulwahab story headline, but they link to accurate reports about Godinho\u2019s death.\nAll the articles referenced in the post correctly identify the boy in the photo and did not misuse his image.
