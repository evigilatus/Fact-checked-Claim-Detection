(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe claim appears to have originated on Twitter on Jan. 27, a couple of days before the cold blast hit the city. Still, that tweet has been retweeted more than 22,000 times.\nWe found one death reported in the Chicago area and related to the polar vortex, a man was struck and killed by a snowplow.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs of Jan. 31, there had\u00a0been at least seven other reported deaths connected to the extreme cold blast. All are tragic. But none of those deaths were of Chicago\u2019s homeless. And, in fact, they took place\u00a0in\u00a0multiple states. The fatalities include a couple who died in a car crash on a snowy road in Indiana; a man found in front of his neighbor\u2019s house in Michigan; the body of another man discovered in a Wisconsin garage; and a University of Iowa student found outside in the middle of the night.\nThe accompanying photograph was also not taken in Chicago and is not from this year.\nIn the picture, the homeless person is actually sleeping on a Toronto sidewalk on Jan. 22, 2013, when temperatures dipped to minus-25 degrees. It was featured in the Canadian outlet the National Post. A reverse-image search shows that the photo was later uploaded to other websites starting in February 2013.\nThe city of Chicago took measures to get people off the streets and converted schools, libraries and other buildings into warming centers. As temperatures plunged, one Chicago homeless shelter took in around 800 homeless men, women and children who sought refuge \u2014 surpassing its capacity more than triplefold, according to local news reports. And one anonymous donor offered to pay the hotel bills for roughly 70 homeless people.\nOur ruling\nA social media post says that 15 homeless people died in Chicago from the recent cold snap.\nWhile there have been multiple deaths connected to the weather event, none of those, so far, have been reported to be of any homeless persons from the Chicago area.\nAdditionally, the photo of the homeless person featured in the post is six years old and was taken in Canada.\nWe rate it False.\n Share the Facts 2019-02-01 16:30:35 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  Says \"15 homeless people have already been found frozen to death in Chicago.\"    Viral Image on the internet     Wednesday, January 30, 2019 2019-01-30    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01071"}
