It is not surprising, therefore, that in the first debate of the 2012 presidential campaign - held on 5 May 2011, in Greenville, S.C. At some point, Fox News commentator Juan Williams Gary Johnson -- the former Republican Governor of New Mexico and a powerful liberal -- asked about corporate taxes. \"Goff. ==History==Johnson, Williams said, \"The unemployment rate in the country is 8.8% and this week, the claims of the unemployed rose to their highest level in eight months. Among your proposals to make the private sector start employment are the abolition of the corporate income tax, the repeal of the Federal Minimum Wage Act and the suspension of the extension of unemployment benefits. Isn't that an unexpected gain for big business?\" Johnson answered, \"Well, certainly not. I think canceling, or getting rid of corporate income tax is simply returning us to what we were. And we have to understand that corporate income tax is a double tax -- that we all own companies, and when income is distributed to us, we pay the tax. So, we have the highest income tax for companies in the world now. Let's cancel it.\" We have considered the question of whether the United States has the \"highest income tax for companies in the world\" in the previous items, so we have thought of revisiting them now. There are two main ways to compare corporate tax burdens. The first is to compare the corporate legal tax rate -- the rate already in the books. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), a group of more than two dozen large industrial democracies, publishes its member countries' rates. The most recent data show that Japan is at the top at 39.54 per cent, compared with 39.21 per cent for the United States. Japan was to reduce its corporate tax rate to a lower level than the United States, but the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear catastrophe that paralysed parts of the country earlier this year left this in doubt. Another way to look at it is to measure what companies actually pay, once exceptions and other adjustments are taken into account. This tax rate is called \"effective.\" The World Bank has collected data from 183 countries and has made a series of statistical adjustments to make a full international comparison of effective tax rates. By this measure, the US rate is much lower than the published rate - 27.6 per cent. In comparison, however, this remains very high: of the larger international economies, only Japan, New Zealand and Thailand imposed a higher effective rate, according to the World Bank study. The World Bank also produces more extensive statistics. It covers not only the calculation of the corporate profit tax, but also a range of other taxes paid by businesses, including the cost of employee taxes borne by the employer. When the World Bank ranked countries from the lowest level of taxes to the highest level, the United States ranked 124th out of 183 - in the sense that corporate taxes were relatively high. A number of other large and/or democratic countries were higher, including Austria, Belgium, Brazil, China, France, Hungary, India, Italy, Spain and Sweden. This latter measure provides a broader overview of United States tax policy vis-\u00e0-vis business, but also creates some complexities. Considering that the employer &apos; s portion of labour taxes makes the corporate tax rate appear to be higher in countries that provide higher benefits such as pensions or health care through business taxes, while making the rate seem lower for countries that provide less generous benefits through tax law. Therefore, comparisons between apples and lollipops can be difficult. There's also a wider context that Johnson doesn't have in him. In a previous item, we noted that when all taxes, including personal income taxes and property taxes - not just corporate taxes - are taken into account and compared to GDP, the United States does not rank close to the top of the OECD scale in the total tax burden. However, Johnson &apos; s claim was more limited, dealing only with corporate taxes. To be more precise, Johnson had to say that the United States had the highest \"firm tax rate\" instead of the highest \"firm tax.\" Using the term \"firm taxes,\" Johnson opens the door to the broader World Bank number, which would put a number of other major countries above the United States in the order. This way of looking at it would underestimate Johnson's argument. On the other hand, it is about to be corrected in the use of the two most common criteria - legal tax rates (which are currently used only by Japan by the United States) and actual rates (where the United States only follows Japan, New Zealand and Thailand). In general, Johnson &apos; s statement is assessed as mostly true. On January 13, 2021, the distinguished fact-finding bloggers announced in a story in which General David H. Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for the use of marines for inaugural security, saying, \"We are not working for you.\"", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13137"}
