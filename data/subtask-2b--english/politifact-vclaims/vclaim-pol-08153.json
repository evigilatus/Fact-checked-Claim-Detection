K. Joseph Shekarchi, D-Warwick.\nThe bill would add language to the state law on employee rights stating that no employee in the state can be fired if the dismissal is against \"an explicit, well established public policy of the state\" or if the employee \"has an implied contractual right to employment.\"\nThose phrases are significant because, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, Rhode Island is one of only three states (Florida and Georgia are the other two) that are known as \"at-will\" employment states.\n\"\u2018At will\u2019 means an employee can be discharged at any time, for good reason, bad reason or no reason at all,\" said Michael J. Yelnosky, dean of the Roger Williams University Law School and an employment law specialist. He said the only limit on ability to fire is if the reason is explicitly against the law, such a racial discrimination.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said Shekarchi\u2019s bill wouldn\u2019t prevent an employer from firing an employee. What it would do, he said, is give a dismissed employee two possible arguments that could be used in a subsequent lawsuit to overturn the firing.\nAn employee might claim he was fired because he refused to do something that was against the law. Or, he might argue there was an implied contract, if, for example, the employer had repeatedly promised the employee he\u2019d always have a job, Yelnosky said.\nIn other words, the bill would make it easier for a fired employee to file a lawsuit to try to get his job back.\nWe contacted Block\u2019s campaign and they referred us to a Jan. 16 news release Block issued on Shekarchi\u2019s bill. In that statement, Block said if the bill passed \"it would give every terminated employee the opportunity to claim that he or she had an implied contractual right to keep the job.\"\nBlock campaign policy director Matthew Schweich said the March 2 \u00a0\"News Conference\" statement was \"a simplified version of the original statement.\"\nNot exactly. On \"News Conference,\" \u00a0Block said an employer would have to go to court to fire an employee. And that\u2019s just not true. Nothing in the bill prevents a firing or requires an employer to get preliminary judicial approval. If Block had stuck to his better-worded news release, he\u2019d have been right.\nWe rule Block\u2019s statement False.\n(Correction: Matthew Schweich is the policy director for the\u00a0Block campaign. The initial version of this item incorrectly identified him as the campaign manager.)", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08153"}
