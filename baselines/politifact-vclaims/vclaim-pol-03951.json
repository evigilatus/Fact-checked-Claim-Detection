You'll be shamed, comedian Amy Schumer says", "text": "Now that the election is over, according to comedian Amy Schumer, some Americans truly have something to fear.\nPublic shaming.\n\"People are going to know if you voted or not,\" Schumer intoned in a video posted online Nov. 3, 2016, five days before the historic presidential contest.\n\"Your voting history is public record. It doesn\u2019t say who you voted for, but it says if you voted at all. Anyone who knows you can just look that s*** up \u2026.\n\"Your decision to vote or not is obviously up to you,\" she added. \"But judging you for that decision could be up to the Internet. And everyone has access to that. Even our parents.\"\nSchumer ended the video (which showed up in the Facebook feed of more than one Wisconsinite) with a call to vote for the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, while making disparaging comments about the Republican nominee (and now president-elect) Donald Trump.\nSo, Schumer doesn\u2019t explicitly state that you can simply go online to see if someone voted.\nBut her just-look-it-up reference makes it sound easy.\nElections experts told us that, as Schumer stated, voter records generally are public records (except, of course, who you voted for). So, by and large, a person\u2019s voting history is generally available by request.\nBut not everywhere. And don\u2019t expect it to be as easy as typing a name onto a website.\nLet\u2019s start with Wisconsin, one of the states that, unexpectedly, helped carry Trump to victory.\nIn Wisconsin\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin LeMahieu\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a TV interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It takes quite a while on Election Day to load those ballots, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you know a voter\u2019s full name and date of birth, you can search that person\u2019s voting history on \u00a0a website maintained by the Wisconsin Elections Commission. It\u2019s super quick. But voter participation isn\u2019t instantly recorded. For the just-ended election, local election clerks have up to 45 days to record voter participation.\nAnd if you don\u2019t know a person\u2019s date of birth, the look-up is more difficult. You can still make a request of the state election commission -- or at the municipal clerk\u2019s office, if you know where the voter lives. The request can be made by mail, email, fax or in person and, depending on how busy an office is, the records are provided as quickly as possible, state elections commission spokesman Reid Magney told us.\nOther states\nIn other states, accessing voting histories can be more difficult -- or, in at least one state, not allowed.\nTo search online in Nevada, the state requires a date of birth plus either the voter\u2019s drivers license number or the last four digits of his or her Social Security number. Alabama doesn\u2019t offer an online search option. Secretary of State spokesman John Bennett told us that if you make the request in person, by email or via phone from his office, often the record can be provided the same day (for 1 cent per voter, a fee that can be rounded up to $1).\nIn Virginia, however, a voter\u2019s voting history is not a public record that is available to the general public, the Virginia Department of Elections told us. Individual voting histories are provided, for a fee, only to groups such as candidates or political groups.\nThat being said, it\u2019s possible to pull up a Virginia resident\u2019s voting history online -- but at the risk of violating the state\u2019s computer fraud law. You must click a box certifying that you are searching for your own voter record, or that you are authorized to search for someone else\u2019s record.\n(Schumer's publicist didn't respond to our requests for information.)\nOur rating\nSchumer said: \"Anyone who knows you can just\" look it up to \"see if you voted.\"\nGenerally speaking, an individual\u2019s voting history is a public record, though how easy it is to access can vary. Depending on the state, you might need information such as a date of birth to do an online search. And if you don\u2019t have such details, you might have to make a request from a state elections office.\nMoreover, an individual\u2019s voting history is not a public record in at least one state (Virginia).\nFor a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, our rating is Half True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/23001946-d8d0-4426-b34d-3209ac90ff47", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03951"}
