Those images are edited", "text": "After almost every major news event, rumors tend to circulate online that claim \"The Simpsons,\" somehow predicted whatever it was that happened.\nIt\u2019s not like the animated TV show has never predicted the future \u2014 it has \u2014 a number of times, including Donald Trump\u2019s election. But it didn\u2019t foretell what happened on Jan. 6 at the U.S. Capitol, as some social media posts claim.\n\"The Simpsons did it again,\" said one viral Facebook post that features an image of the show\u2019s character Groundskeeper Willie waving an American flag at the Capitol building dressed in the exact same horned garb as a costume donned by one of the Pro-Trump rioters who breached the building.\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Willie has never been seen in any horned helmet, tattoos or American flag. The image of Willie used in this post showing the character with his arm raised appears to come from the Simpsons Tapped Out mobile game, as many pointed out online. In it, his upper body shows no tattoos and his red hair is unfettered by any headdress.\nNo matter how badly you may have wanted this to be true, it\u2019s not.
