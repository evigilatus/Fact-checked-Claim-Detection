Brian Kemp\u2019s family. One of Kemp\u2019s daughters has called Deal her best friend.\nDeal\u2019s hometown newspaper, the Statesboro Herald, reported that Deal was killed after his vehicle was struck from behind on Interstate 16.\nBut conspiracy theories are swirling on social media, alleging without any evidence that Deal was murdered.
