What should we learn from Christian Christians? What should we learn from Christian Christians? They asked about Georgia &apos; s new immigration legislation and the response of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to recent historic hurricanes that had destroyed cities throughout the south-east of the country. One raised the most sensitive -- literally -- of all subjects: getting raised down at the airport. \"Are we gonna skip touch and steal?\" One of the attendees asked Napolitano. \"The machines that wipe bodies and so on? Is there any better way to do this?\" \"Well, actually, very, very, very, very few people get fucked,\" answered Napolitano. \"It is only under very limited circumstances. However, they get -- those who are cut off -- they tend to get YouTube.\" You made fun of me. \"Look, look, no one wants to see a six-year-old who's a mess. Even if it were done in accordance with the procedural protocol.\" In April, a video was posted on YouTube.com for a 6-year-old girl who was raised at New Orleans Airport. Just this week, pictures of a child being searched at Kansas City International Airport. Very, very, very few people? We wondered. This is too much, given the public yelling, Napoletano's estimates sent the writers of Polyte Fakt Georgia battling. We've asked TSA for more details. The Transport Security Agency is part of the Ministry of Internal Security and protects the country &apos; s transport systems. Last fall, the Transport Security Agency started using special scanners that showed pictures of passengers, including what was under their clothes. The critics called it \"the seeming strip search\" and said it was a major invasion. The TSA has offered wetting as an alternative, but these critics have also been frustrated. In October, the Agency announced that officers would implement \"enhanced\" survey procedures. Previously, examiners used the back of their hands to search sensitive areas. Now they use the front of their hands and do more in-depth research. Adults can also receive random inspections. Children receive \"modified\" mutations if they need additional examination. When the busy week of travel approached Thanksgiving, the passengers complained about touching their genitals and their breasts. A video appeared on YouTube.com for a little kid who cries during the moisturization process and screams for the screen to stop. Fathers were angry. The passengers threatened to stop flying, and some signed long security lines at the airport. The expected chaos never came true. In most cases, passengers went through the screening process without any fuss. \"Everything, people wanted to reach their destinations,\" said Christopher Bedwell, security expert with the international airport group. We asked the transport security agency how many of its wetting operations are taking place at the country's airports. The spokesman for the Transport Security Agency in Atlanta John Allen told us that during March, 3 per cent of air passengers were subject to an inspection. The TSA collects these data by monitoring \"data from selected airports throughout the year,\" written in an e-mail. This figure is \"compatible from previous periods of time.\" :: Polyte Fact Georgia investigated other data to see if other groups had verified the TSA numbers. Critics such as the American Civil Liberties Union and passenger rights groups did not do so. Not even the industry groups we've reached out to. We found a survey of Gallup conducted in November 19-21, which said that 15% of adults who travelled twice or more last year received a full test. The margin of error in the survey was 4 percentage points. On February 1, 2021, Tom Cotton mentioned in an interview with Fox and friends \"Many of these arriving immigrants, we have no way of checking their background for either health or security.\" \u2022 February 3, 2012, the 15 percent ratio does not conflict with the TSA figures. The more you pass from a security checkpoint, the more you get a patch. Therefore, Polyte Fact Georgia took the TSA numbers and made some calculations. Allen from the TSA said that \"on an average day, about 2 million people are screened at TSA checkpoints.\" Three percent of two million is 60,000 people. This means that about 1.8 million people receive assistance within a month. This is more than four times the population of Atlanta. This doesn't sound like \"very, very, very\" a few people to us. If Napolitano had said that \"a small percentage of passengers\" were promoted every month, she would have been right. But she talked about \"people.\" In addition, the word \"very\" has been used three times, although the TSA figures show that the number of passengers receiving a dung can be more than 1 million in one month.
