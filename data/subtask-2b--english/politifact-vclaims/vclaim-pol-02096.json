Tammy Baldwin did back a Department of Peace, but Kevin Nicholson's attack needs some context", "text": "While defending his criticism of military veterans who support Democrats, Kevin Nicholson also attacked Wisconsin U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin -- the Democrat whose job he wants.\nNicholson was interviewed May 4, 2018 by Dan O\u2019Donnell, who hosts a conservative talk show on WISN-AM in Milwaukee. Nicholson, a first-time candidate and former Marine, said:\nTammy Baldwin cosponsored legislation that wanted to establish the Department of Peace and Nonviolence. That\u2019s a fundamentally unserious answer to a serious question -- the question being, How do we keep the American people safe? She\u2019s going to have to answer for that in this election. I\u2019m going to make sure that she does.\nNicholson made essentially the same claim about Baldwin and the Department of Peace in another Milwaukee radio interview two days earlier.\nMoreover, both Nicholson and state Sen. Leah Vukmir -- the two Republicans vying in the August 2018 primary to challenge Baldwin three\u00a0months later -- are trying to portray Baldwin as extreme.\nSo is an outside group -- although we rated Mostly False its claim that Baldwin \"supported legislation allowing citizens to withhold funding for our troops.\"\nAs we\u2019ll see, Baldwin did back the Department of Peace legislation, which the Washington Post called the \"Hope Diamond of liberal ideas: pure, breathtaking and highly impractical in the real world.\"\nBut it\u2019s important to note that Baldwin\u2019s most recent cosponsorship was before she left the House for the Senate, and that as a senator she has backed certain national defense measures.\n\n\n\n\nLike us on Facebook.

It was introduced by then-U.S. Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio.\n(Baldwin for 14 years held the Madison-area House seat now held by Democrat Mark Pocan. She joined the Senate in 2013.)\nIn 2009, Kucinich introduced a similar measure, the Department of Peace Act. Baldwin cosponsored it and she cosponsored the 2011\u00a0version.\nThe 2012 Post article said that with the $10 billion-a-year Department of Peace:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.
