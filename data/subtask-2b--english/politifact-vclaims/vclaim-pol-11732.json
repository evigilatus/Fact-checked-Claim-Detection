The device solely fires steel BBs, Justin Biddle, a marketing manager at Umarex USA, told us in an interview.\n\nGonz\u00e1lez helped us isolate the federal law that regulates the appearance of imitation firearms, stipulating the 6-millimeter orange marking requirement for airsoft guns. Those guns shoot projectiles at a lower speed than pellet or BB guns, according to Jeffrey Welty, an assistant professor of public law and government at the University of North Carolina School of Government, who specializes in criminal law and procedure.\n\nBut the marking requirement does not apply to \"traditional BB, paint-ball, or pellet-firing air guns that expel a projectile through the force of air pressure,\" the law says.\n\nSo, the gun used in Brownsville was exempt from federal marking requirements.\n\nIn the wake of the shooting, the office of Rep. Rene Oliveira, D-Brownsville, also examined legal issues related to facsimile firearms, said J.J. Garza, Oliveira\u2019s chief of staff. Garza pointed us to another part of the U.S. Code, Section G, which states that federal provisions on imitation gun identification supersede such local or state laws and ordinances.\n\nBut are there state and local restrictions anyway? \u00a0\n\nMeagan Dorsch, a spokeswoman for the National Conference of State Legislatures, emailed us the organization\u2019s July 2011 list showing states with imitation firearm statutes: \u00a0Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, Tennessee and Wisconsin.\n\nWe wondered how any state statutes survive without conflicting with the superseding federal law. By addressing aspects not included in the federal provisions, advised David Kopel, an expert on firearms policy and research director at the Independence Institute, a free-market think tank in Colorado. For instance, he said by email, \"Louisiana\u2019s statutes only applies to guns that fire blanks, and those aren't covered by the federal law.\"\n\nSeparately, experts at the Texas Legislative Library said that some Texas cities, including Plano, Horseshoe Bay, Farmers Branch and Carrollton have local ordinances that regulate how people display facsimile firearms--no reckless displays of imitation guns in public places, for example--but these statutes don\u2019t regulate the appearance of the guns.\n\nOur ruling\n\nThere are no state-level regulations of the appearance of pellet/BB or airsoft guns sold in Texas, but federal law requires airsoft guns to have special markings -- a wrinkle Lucio did not clarify.\nWe rate his statement Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11732"}
