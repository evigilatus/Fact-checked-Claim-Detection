This time, the Sanders campaign said that it needed more support in the southern states, and generally to reach more minority voters. But Saunders said last week that this was not true for all ages, during a visit to the state that gave him his first major victory in 2016. \"This victory here in New Hampshire has led us to win win wins in 21 other states across the country, 13 million votes, more than 1,700 delegates to the Democratic Conference, and, more importantly to me, more votes from young people - black, white, Latin, Asian, Native American and Native American - from Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton together,\" said Sanders. Saunders made a similar allegation in CNN City Hall in late February when he said: \"We ended up winning among young people. More voices than those of young African Americans, Latin Americans, Asian Americans and Native Americans from Clinton and Trump combined.\" This seems to complicate a dominant account of Sanders &apos; failure to communicate with minority voters during the 2016 elections. This means that a growing group of voters went to him in a great way. We've decided to check if his demand carries water. The initial data for 2016 were analysed by VTDiger and reached polling experts throughout the country. We found that while Sanders received fewer votes than the 30th group of Clinton and Trump together, it is impossible to know -- for us and for Sanders -- whether the number of minority youth who voted for him is greater than the other candidates. While his quote in New Hampshire can be read as saying that young people of different races voted together for him in greater numbers than Trump and Clinton together, it is clear from CNN's quote that this claim also applies to each individual race. Ariana Jones, spokesman for the Sanders campaign, told us that the claim was based on a polling report for exit from the CIRCLE and a survey conducted by the University of Chicago Black Youth Project. The data collected by the Centre indicate that in all presidential pre-elections and rallies, Sanders received more than 2 million votes from young people - more than the estimated 1.6 million votes of Clinton and Trump. However, these figures are not disaggregated by race or ethnic origin. In the University of Chicago study, which required more than 1,750 people between the ages of 18 and 30 to support them, 60 per cent of African-American youth, 69 per cent of Asian-American youth, 68 per cent of Latino youth, and 59 per cent of white youth said that they supported Sanders. According to the June 2016 survey, 54 per cent of young African-Americans who said they had voted in the initial elections reported voting in favour of Sanders, but the survey does not provide additional information explaining how many people said they had voted in favour of Clinton or Trump. \"Our statements indicate that, contrary to the overwhelming support that Hillary Clinton received from older African-American voters, the majority of adult African-American voters supported Bernie Sanders in the 2016 Democratic Party's initial election,\" the study says. We contacted the University of Chicago and one speaker told us that researchers did not prove that these young people had already voted in primary school. \"They suggest that this issue be seen as one of the measures of support more than the actual votes,\" said the spokesperson. We asked Kei Kawashima-Jinsberg, director of CIRCLE at the University of Tufts, about Sanders &apos; claim. CIRCLE also said it has no way of knowing whether his statement is correct or wrong. He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. By Bill McCarthy: January 12, 2021, \"The basic data used to calculate the cumulative votes of young people in the initial 2016 elections - total voting and voting - do not allow us to break the estimates of youth voting by race,\" Kaushima-Ginsberg said. \"So we have no means of confirming or rejecting the assertion made by Sen. \"Sanders.\" The exit polls shed some light on the situation, particularly the black youth vote. An analysis of opinion polls in 25 major states conducted by NBC News shows that Sanders received 52 per cent of the voices of African Americans under 30 years of age, compared with 47 per cent of Clinton. Based on CNN exit polls from 27 states, 52 per cent of black women under 30 voted for Sanders while 47 per cent voted for Clinton. Among black men of the same age, 50 percent voted for Sanders and 48 percent for Clinton. CNN data show that 31 per cent of Latin voters voted less than 30 for Clinton, while 69 per cent voted for Sanders. We have not been able to find poll data that break Trump's youth vote on the basis of race or race. The Centre reported that Trump won the youth vote in only 11 states, based on polls conducted in the exit elections from the initial elections held in 21 states. The Centre estimates that Trump received more than 800,000 of the 2.3 million votes cast by young people in these Republican competitions. So while there are no data conclusively proving Saunders' health, we also didn't find anything proving him completely wrong. But the numbers on the voters' demographics from Tuesday gave us a pause. In Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Massachusetts, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont and Virginia, joint opinion polls to emerge from the democratic pre-elections found that 61 per cent of young black voters voted for Clinton while 36 per cent voted for Sanders. In those states, 60 per cent of Latino youth voters supported Sanders and 39 per cent supported Clinton. Saunders received a big push on Tuesday with white youth: 62 per cent of that demographic voted for him and 37 per cent voted for Clinton. The huge losses of Tuesday among young black voters could have been outweighed by large masses of those voters elsewhere. In New York, for example, 81 per cent of 18- to 24-year-olds voted for Sanders. So did Saunders specifically win the black vote for young people? Gary Langer, an opinion poll expert for ABC News, told us that he did not have the data to make a final decision as to whether the number of black youth who voted for Sanders was greater than the number who voted for Clinton and Trump. However, on whether Saunders won more young non-white voters than all other candidates, he said: \"It only seems possible, knowing that it is possible.\" Our rule, Sanders, said, \"He got more votes from young people - black, white, Latin, Asian, American and Native Americans - from Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton combined.\" It is true that Sanders received more votes from voters between the ages of 18 and 30 than Clinton and Trump together, but the claim that more young minorities voted for him is unclear based on current data. The campaign &apos; s reliance on a survey showing the support of young minorities for the Vermont senator is not the same as the voting data for those segments of the population. We're assessing this claim as mostly correct.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00883"}
