Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and four other members of the Democratic Senate took the extraordinary step of presenting a court-friendly note requesting the conservative judges to resist active right-wing pressure. The Democrats claimed that these groups were aimed at restructuring the judiciary to reflect the interests of their undeclared financiers, with regard to everything from expanding the scope of the second amendment to weakening trade unions and undermining voting rights. In order for the White House to influence the composition of the Court, he said that the combined $34 million of \"dark money\" went to obstruct Merrick Garland, President Barack Obama's Supreme Court candidate, and confirmed the two options chosen by President Donald Trump of the Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorso and Judge Brett Cavanaugh. In follow-up to the legal summary, White House described in a press article published on 6 September in the Washington Post: \"An unnamed donor gave $17 million to the Leonard Judicial Crisis Network to prevent the nomination of Judge Merrick Garland and support Gorch; then a donor - perhaps the same donor - provided another $17 million in support of Cavanaugh.\" It may be difficult to follow the course of unknown political spending accurately, and we wanted to know the factual basis of White House's claim. And the evidence we found about the source of the money, and where it went, supports it. The Judicial Crisis Network is one of several organizations consisting of a mysterious network of politically conservative non-profit organizations that, under IRS rules, are not required to disclose their donors. (Liberative groups also spend millions on Supreme Court battles, and which side spends more can be difficult to track). The White House is right that the Judicial Crisis Network received two donations of unknown supporters up to $17 million while the Supreme Court confirmation battles were under way. His office referred to an article by the MapLight Transparency Teams and the Centre for Responsive Policy, which linked public disclosure documents to the Judicial Crisis Network for the fiscal years 2016 and 2017. These documents showed a contribution of $17.9 million in 2016, followed by a contribution of $17.1 million next year. None of the donors were detected, so they could be the same person or group. How did the contribution to the public disclosure of the Judicial Crisis Network from FY2017 appear? The Judicial Crisis Network is among the many groups associated with the activist Leonard Leo, who advised President Donald Trump about his judicial choices - and whose name Whitehouse dropped in his article. Liu is the Executive Vice-President of the conservative and liberal Law Association of the Federal Assembly. However, the Washington Post investigation described Leo's influence in more comprehensive terms, referring to it as \"Maestro for a network of interlocking non-profit organizations,\" which \"impacted the non-profit state system to influence judicial appointments that will form the nation for decades.\" The Judicial Crisis Network and the Federal Assembly have not responded to our requests for comments. The tax returns since the establishment of the Judicial Crisis Network in 2005 (then called the Judicial Assurance Network) show that they were from Anne and Neil Corkery's home, described by the Washington Post as \"Leo's close allies,\" who served in various positions in other groups of their own. Among them is the Wellsbring Committee, which donated millions to the Judicial Crisis Network. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 On January 11, 2012, Neil and Anne Corkery were registered at different times as President of Wales. According to Maplight, Daniel Casey, Director of the Judicial Crisis Network, is the father of Wilsbring, Director Michael Casey. Like the Judicial Crisis Network, the Source Committee was established under section 501 (c) (4) of the Internal Revenue Act, which means that its donors can remain confidential. However, these organizations are required to disclose their grantees. Wellpring reported a $14.8 million grant to the Judicial Crisis Network during fiscal year 2017. Last year, Welsbring provided the group with $23.4 million. According to MapLight, between 2012 and 2015, Willsbring awarded the Judicial Crisis Network more than $15 million. (WellSpring in December 2018) Through the work of transparency groups such as Map Light and the Centre for Responsive Policy, more information has emerged on the relationship between Welsbring and the Judicial Crisis Network. \"while we were able to aggregate that Welspring has been the largest donor to the Judicial Crisis Network for many years, Welspring is also a group of \"dark money,\" so the final source of funding is still hidden,\" Anna Masoglya said of Paulette Fuckett's Responsive Policy Center. \"Well, Spring adds an additional layer of isolation between the judicial crisis network and donors or donors who finance the operation.\" The White House accurately described the role of the Judicial Crisis Network in the fight against two vacant seats in the Supreme Court. The group launched a seven-digit advertising campaign days after the death of Governor Antonin Skalia on February 13, 2016. Objective: To prevent the potential Obama candidate from replacing Skalia in the Supreme Court. \"Today, the Judicial Crisis Network is carrying out a publicity campaign \"Let People Decide,\" reading a statement from the Chairman of the Group, Cary Severino. \"In this first phase, we want to thank the United States. Members of the Senate who say that the American people must decide who chooses the next Supreme Court judge.\" The announcements paid tribute to Republican senators such as Chuck Grassley of Iowa, then Chairman of the Judicial Committee of the Senate, who opposed the holding of hearings to confirm the appointment of Judge Merrick Garland, who was eventually to be nominated by Obama, which eventually left the Skalya seat vacant in Trump &apos; s presidency. According to a press release issued by the Judicial Crisis Network, which has since been removed from its website, the group spent more than $7 million to prevent Garland's nomination. The organization subsequently pledged an additional $10 million to support the confirmation of the Trump Neil Gorso candidate, which was confirmed to the Tribunal on 7 April 2017. After Judge Anthony Kennedy, the swinging court voter, announced his retirement in late June 2018, the Judicial Crisis Network prepared again to start work. With the nomination of Judge Brett Cavanaugh by Trump the following month, the Group stated that it would spend at least $10 million on declarations in favour of Cavanaugh - the same amount that it had spent to support Gorch. Our Governor, White House, said: \"One unnamed donor has given $17 million to the legal crisis network associated with Leo to prevent the nomination of Judge Merrick Garland and support Gors; then he has given a donor - perhaps the same donor - another $17 million to support Cavanaugh.\" Public disclosure documents show that the Judicial Crisis Network received $17.9 million in 2016 and $17.1 million in the following year. Both came from an unknown source during the fights to confirm two vacant seats in the Supreme Court. (We were unable to determine whether it was from a single donor.) The media reports show a number of interlocking relationships and interests between the Judicial Crisis Network and the influential conservative activist Leonard Leo.
