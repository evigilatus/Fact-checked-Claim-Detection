That\u2019s why Illinois and other states across the nation are collectively spending hundreds of millions of dollars to make sure every eligible citizen is counted.\nIn an Oct. 13 tweet, Gov. J.B. Pritzker suggested Illinois leads the nation in that effort.\n\"Earlier today, my administration announced an additional $1M (million) in funding for Census outreach, on top of our historic & nation-leading $29M (million) investment,\" Pritzker tweeted.\nGiven that other, larger states share the same incentive for an accurate count, we decided to check out the claim.\nThe National Conference of State Legislatures, which tracks Census spending by state, publishes data showing Illinois ranks second among states in total spending at $31.5 million, below California at $187 million. The NCSL previously had New York above Illinois as well, at $60 million, but has since revised it down to $20 million.\nWhen asked why the governor said Illinois is \"nation-leading,\" his top spokeswoman, Jordan Abudayyeh, said her boss\u2019s tweet was referring not to total spending, but to spending per citizen, or per capita.\nBy that measure, Illinois\u2019 $2.40 per person in Census spending ranks third in the nation, behind New Mexico at $5.50 per person and California at $4.70 per person, based on NCSL\u2019s state spending figures and 2019 U.S. Census population estimates.\nAbudayyeh said the top-three ranking suffices to call Illinois \"nation leading.\"\n\"Illinois is in the top three of states, so we are \u2018nation-leading\u2019 in that regard,\" she said.\nIn the past, Pritzker\u2019s statements about Illinois\u2019 supremacy in Census spending have at times been less ambiguous. In a Dec. 4 statement, he left little doubt he thought Illinois ranked number one \u2014 a claim that has never been true.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMichele Bachmann\n\n\nstated on June 17, 2009 in a Washington Times interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays the Constitution only requires her to tell the census \"how many people are in our home.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Robert Farley \u2022 June 25, 2009\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have committed $29 million, as was mentioned earlier, to prepare and execute the Census,\" Pritzker announced. \"And that is by far, in the United States, the most on a per capita basis that\u2019s being spent in any state.\"\nWhen the governor made that announcement, California topped the list, according to a report by The Associated Press published a week earlier on Nov. 23.\nSeveral months later, New Mexico catapulted to the top of the per-capita spending list with an additional appropriation of $8 million.\u00a0\nDenice Ross, a senior fellow at the National Conference on Citizenship who worked for more data transparency on the Census, said that while the term \"nation-leading\" is not precise, it is fair given Illinois\u2019 level of spending compared to almost all other states.\n\"\u2018On top of our historic and top-three among states $29 million investment\u2019 would be technically more accurate,\" Ross said. \"Twitter of course makes it awkward.\"\nOur ruling\nPritzker said, \"Earlier today, my administration announced an additional $1M in funding for Census outreach, on top of our historic & nation-leading $29M investment.\"\nWhile Illinois did not spend the most on Census outreach, it did rank in the top three among all other states.\nWe rate Pritzker\u2019s claim as Mostly True.\n\nMOSTLY TRUE \u2014 The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18413"}
