John Kasich says federal workers have 'zippo, zero' ability to collectively bargain", "text": "Equity among workers is one of Republican Gov. John Kasich\u2019s most consistent arguments in favor of Ohio\u2019s new collective bargaining law.\n\nThe law, Senate Bill 5, will bring Ohio\u2019s public workers closer in line with private sector workers, who, on average, pay more for health care benefits and have weaker pensions, Kasich repeatedly has said.\n\nNow the governor is weaving collective bargaining for federal workers \u2013 or lack thereof \u2013 into his support for the law.\n\nEven though SB 5 restricts collective bargaining for the state\u2019s 360,000 public workers, they would still be better off than federal workers, Kasich recently told a Youngstown radio show.\n\n\"Two million federal workers negotiate zippo, zero,\" Kasich told radio host Dan Rivers on April 26 when discussing SB 5. \"There is no collective bargaining for federal employees.\"\n\nKasich has been among the most vocal supporters of SB 5, and likely will continue to fill that role if the law heads toward a voter referendum this fall.\n\nConsidering his influence and the widespread interest in SB 5, PolitiFact Ohio decided to check the governor\u2019s claim about collective bargaining for federal workers.\n\nWe did not have to dig deep to get started.\n\nOur colleagues at PolitiFact checked a similar statement Republican Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker made in late February, when his state, like Ohio, was in the middle of a controversial effort to pass legislation to limit collective bargaining for public workers.\n\nWalker told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press host David Gregory that \"most federal employees do not have collective bargaining for benefits, nor for pay.\"\n\nPolitiFact gave Walker\u2019s claim a True rating. So how does Kasich\u2019s similar claim hold up?\n\nFederal workers generally cannot collectively bargain pay and benefits, but they can negotiate working conditions, according to the Federal Labor Relations Authority, which administers the labor-management relations program for more than 1 million federal workers.\n\n\"Employees also have the right to engage in collective bargaining with respect to conditions of employment through representatives chosen by employees,\" the FLRA\u2019s program guide reads.\n\nThere are about 1.6 million non-postal federal workers. Of those, about 1.1 million are represented by more than 90 labor organizations. Some workers in agencies such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission can negotiate wages. Others in the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.S. Government Accountability Office and other departments do not engage in collective bargaining.\n\nFor the most part, however, federal workers only can negotiate working conditions, said Sarah Whittle Spooner, FLRA counsel for regulatory and external affairs.\n\nThe right to negotiate working conditions is significant, said Kate Bronfenbrenner, director of labor education research at Cornell University. (PolitiFact also interviewed Bronfenbrenner while checking Gov. Walker\u2019s claim. We interviewed her separately.)\n\nBronfenbrenner pointed to a recent union election among the Transportation Security Administration\u2019s 43,000 workers. They had three options: either of two unions vying to represent them or no union at all. More than 16,000 of the workers voted in favor of a union representation and about 3,000 voted for neither union. Because the vote between the two unions was so close, there will be a runoff election May 23 to June 21.\n\n\"Would they have organized a union if they didn\u2019t have the right to bargain?\" Bronfenbrenner asked. \"They wouldn\u2019t have gone through all this if there wasn\u2019t something at the end of the tunnel.\"\n\nSo what does it mean for federal workers who can negotiate working conditions?\n\nIt means they can negotiate discipline policies, hours of work, procedures for performance evaluations, safety, procedures for layoffs and more, according to the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal employees union, with about 625,000 members from about 75 federal agencies.\n\nKasich spokesman Rob Nichols acknowledged federal workers do have some ability to bargain collectively.\n\n\"The fact is most federal workers cannot collectively bargain for pay or benefits and the governor\u2019s point is that under Senate Bill 5, Ohio\u2019s public employees will have more collective bargaining rights than most federal employees,\" Nichols said.\n\nSo where does Kasich land on the Truth-O-Meter?\n\nIt would be easy to rate Kasich\u2019s statement False. Federal workers may have limited collective bargaining powers. But that isn't \"zippo\" and \"zero.\"\n\nBut the governor also is known to shoot from the hip, and ruling an off-the-cuff statement as False without looking at his underlying meaning would amount to a game of gotcha -- a game PolitiFact doesn\u2019t play.\n\nKasich long has advocated reigning in collective bargaining, arguing that schools and governments needed better ability to control labor costs. But he has not called for it\u2019s elimination.\n\nChanges approved in SB 5 would reduce the number of topics subject to union negotiations, ban public workers from striking, prohibit employers from paying more than 85 percent of workers\u2019 health insurance costs, and base pay raises on performance rather than length of service.\n\nBut public workers in Ohio would continue to have more collective bargaining powers than most federal workers, Kasich\u2019s underlying point.\n\nThat some federal workers can bargain over working conditions, rather than having \"zero\" collective bargaining ability, is a critical fact, though, that could give a listener a different impression.\n\nWe rate Kasich\u2019s statement Barely True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEditor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.
