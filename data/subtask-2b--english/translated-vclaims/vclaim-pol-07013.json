The plans include reform of the tax law, renewal of the fight against Obama's sponsorship, and approval of the Keystone XL pipeline, according to the Wall Street Journal opening by the Speaker of the House of Representatives John Bonner and the current minority leader of the Senate, Mitch McConnell. Fox and Friends mobilized the host and correspondent Anna Kuiman in the last initiative during a discussion after election day on the plans of the leaders of the Global Democratic Party. \"If I agree to the Keystone XL pipeline, there will be tens of thousands of jobs created,\" said Quayman Nov 6, addressing President Barack Obama. The argument regarding job creation behind the controversial pipeline is that one of the fact-checkers has reviewed it many times. To sum up: Keystone is not the huge job generator that some make it. The Trans Canada project, which mixes a heavy mixture of crude oil from western Canada to Steel City, Neb, has long been suspended pending review by Obama and the Department of Foreign Affairs, which has to determine whether it \"maintains the national interest\" because it crosses international borders. The pipeline will be linked to the existing southern phase opened in early 2014, which will deliver more than 800,000 barrels of oil to refineries on the Gulf coast. With regard to new posts, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs estimates that the operation of the pipeline will only result in the establishment of 35 full-time permanent posts and 15 temporary contractors. Full-time workers are \"required for annual operations, including routine inspection, maintenance and repair.\" Some work in Nebraska's field office. The lack of many full-time jobs is logical, as the project aims to build a pipeline so that tar sand can travel without the need for railways or ships. However, there are temporary posts that can be supported by the construction of the $8 billion pipeline over a year or two. Over a period of up to two years of construction, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs estimates a total of 42,100 posts \"to be supported by the construction of the proposed project.\" Some functions are directly linked to the pipeline and construction. The other jobs are simply the nature of how $8 billion is spent in the economy. More than 99 percent are temporary. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs states that construction will require approximately 10,400 seasonal workers for periods of either four or eight months. This work operates in 3,900 \"annual average\" jobs over one year of construction, or 1,950 jobs per year if it takes two years to complete the project. The construction works will be distributed to four states, Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska and Kansas, although most workers will be specialists and need to be brought from outside those states, the report notes. Trans Canada accounts for a slightly different direct job creation, with an estimated 9,000 public construction and manufacturing jobs. These amounts are measured not on an average annual basis, but on a general basis. Trans Canada argues that this is more logical because the nature of the construction work is that contractors move from one job to another, even if it does not last for one year at a time. \"We've always talked about attitudes because that's what we cut salaries for,\" said the spokesman for Trans Canada Sean Howard. He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. \u2022 January 12, 2012, with either estimate, the number of posts created directly in the pipeline does not amount to tens of thousands. To get there, it also needs to include indirect and induced \"external\" functions. Indirect jobs are the result of goods and services purchased by construction crews. Induced jobs are those created by workers who spend their wages in the economy. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs estimates that 26,100 indirect and induced jobs will be supported by the construction of the proposed project during the construction phase. The functions are to provide the supply chain to Keystone as well as staff spending on housing, food, recreation, health care, etc. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs calls these functions \"supported\" and not created because they include those that already exist. Put everything together and get very few permanent jobs, about 10,000 or more temporary construction positions and 26,000 additional temporary jobs that can be created or supported. There are two additional observations: According to the Canadian Globe & Mail, the cost of extending the pipeline increased from $5.4 billion to $8 billion. It is unclear, however, whether higher costs could be linked to more jobs, as Ian Goodman, Chairman of the Goodman Energy Group Limited and the Economic Consulting Company, said. :: Goodman co-authored the 2011 report, questioning the possibilities of working for the project. Increased cost factors in inflation and financing costs. \"The high costs now estimated by Trans Canada may pay more dollars for a similar amount of actual work and materials to build the project.\" There is as yet no news of when the Ministry of Foreign Affairs can make its recommendation on the project. \"We gave up guessing about it a while ago,\" Howard said, \"but the facts on the project have not changed.\" The governor, Quayman, said that the Keystone XL pipeline would create tens of thousands of jobs. A review by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs found that the project could support - rather than create - 42,100 jobs. However, this number needs to be explained in large measure and does not amount to tens of thousands of full-time jobs in the most common sense of employment. This figure represents the direct, indirect and induced functions of the project estimated over two years of construction, all of which are temporary, with the exception of 50 posts. The Department of Foreign Affairs and across Canada have different ways to account for jobs needed for the construction phase, but none is estimated at tens of thousands. Some of the remaining indirect and induced jobs supported by subcontractors and staff expenditure may already exist, and this is not exactly job creation as much as job promotion.
