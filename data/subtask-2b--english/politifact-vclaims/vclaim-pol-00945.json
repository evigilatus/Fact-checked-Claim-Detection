Above it were the words, \"Thailand police found this in a container vehicle. Dead bodies of children. Their organs where (sic) found removed.\"\nThe Feb. 28 post drew expressions of grief. One person wrote, \"Oh, my lord. So sad.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

An identical image appeared on a Syrian news website at that time. A United Nations inspection team found \"clear and convincing evidence\" that Sarin gas had killed more than 1,500 people.\nThe false tie between the dead children and organ harvesting goes back several years.

Obama had said previously that if Syria crossed a \"red line,\" it would pay the price. But Obama said Congress should approve the mission, and with Afghanistan and Iraq as the backdrop, Congress had no appetite for stepping into another conflict.\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post said a photo of rows of dead children showed the victims of organ trafficking.
