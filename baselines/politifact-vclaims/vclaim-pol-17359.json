Bloomberg then closes the letter with this line:\n\"P.S. North Carolina election law allows all registered voters, regardless of registration, to vote in the Democratic Primary.\"\nThe letter was first reported by The Richmond Observer.\nSo is it true that any registered voter can vote in any party\u2019s primary? No.\u00a0\nSemi-closed primary\nNorth Carolina has what\u2019s known as a \"semi-closed\" primary, according to the NC board of elections.\nThis means that anybody who is registered with a specific party can only vote in that party\u2019s primary.\nUnaffiliated voters can also participate in one party\u2019s primary election -- but only if that party opens its doors to those voters. In North Carolina, political parties aren\u2019t required to open their primaries.\nEach of North Carolina\u2019s recognized parties has until the first day of December to inform the NC elections board whether it wants to open its primary.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJenna Wadsworth\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth Carolina Secretary of State Elaine Marshall \"has won more statewide races than probably anyone else alive.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Paul Specht \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis year, the Democratic, Republican and Libertarian parties will have open primaries, according to the elections board. In other words: if you are registered as an unaffiliated voter in North Carolina, you can participate in one of their primaries.\nMeanwhile, the Constitution and Green parties are closed -- meaning you have to be registered with those parties to participate.\nA follow-up letter\nIt\u2019s unclear how many letters the Bloomberg campaign sent in North Carolina. LaToya Evans, a spokeswoman for Bloomberg, told us that the campaign is working to rectify the situation.\n\"Last week, the campaign sent a letter introducing Mike Bloomberg and his record targeted at Democrats and unaffiliated voters in North Carolina,\" Evans said in a Feb. 4 email.\u00a0\n\"These voters can show up on election day and vote in the Democratic primary. We are sending a follow up mailer to those who received the letter to clarify how they can participate in the upcoming primary. We regret any confusion this may have caused.\"\nIn the meantime, the NC elections board is hoping voters will rely only on official government communications for information.\n\"We always encourage people to rely on county and state elections boards and their materials for reliable information about elections,\" board spokesman Pat Gannon told PolitiFact.\nOur ruling\nBloomberg\u2019s letter said \"North Carolina election law allows all registered voters, regardless of registration, to vote in the Democratic Primary.\"\nThat\u2019s not true. North Carolina has a semi-closed primary.\n\u00a0If you\u2019re an unaffiliated voter, you can vote in one of the major party\u2019s primaries.\nIf you\u2019re registered with a certain party, you cannot participate in another party\u2019s primary like Bloomberg\u2019s letter implies.
