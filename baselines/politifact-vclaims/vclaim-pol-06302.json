When was the last time you saw a Chevrolet in Tokyo? It doesn't exist, folks. They beat us all the time.\"\nWe couldn\u2019t travel to Tokyo for this fact-check, but we did hear from Chevy and other sources to shed light on whether it\u2019s really true that Chevy \"doesn\u2019t exist\" in Tokyo.\nLiterally, it\u2019s not true. Chevy sells cars in Japan in four models: Sonic, Captiva, Camaro and Corvette. (Here's a screenshot of www.ChevroletJapan.com):\n\nBut Trump, in what we might describe as his Trumped-up speaking style, has a point in that Chevy\u2019s Japanese sales are a big struggle story.\nIn 2014, Chevrolet sold 597 cars in Japan. No, we are not forgetting any zeroes at the end of that figure.\n\"To be sure, if you visit Tokyo, chances are you won\u2019t see a single American brand car during your entire stay,\" said Hans Greimel, the Asia editor of Automotive News who has documented GM\u2019s troubles in Japan. \"They are incredibly rare here because their reputation is bad, and their sales are so low.\"\nStill, GM-owned Chevys and Cadillacs, plus Fords and Jeeps, are all actively sold, Greimel said. Import sales data show Chevrolet sold 367 vehicles in the first five months of 2015. Cadillac sold 358, Ford sold almost 2,000, and Jeep sold 2,756.\nJapanese automakers \u00a0\u2014 Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Suzuki, Mazda, Daihatsu, Subaru, Mitsubishi \u00a0\u2014 accounted for 92 percent of the 5.45 million vehicles sold in Japan in 2014, according to financial research group IHS Automotive.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne issue: In Japan, like in the United Kingdom, motorists drive on the left side of the road with the steering wheel on the right side. GM sells two Chevy cars with right-hand drive in Japan, Greimel reported, but not in Cadillac.\nGM spokesman Jim Cain calls GM\u2019s strategy in Asia \"a question of priorities.\" The Japanese market is tough for non-domestic manufacturers to crack.\n\"We\u2019re concentrating on markets and segments where we can be a successful and profitable growing enterprise,\" Cain said, \"and the reality is that the barriers to entry in Japan are very high for foreign automakers.\"\nGM is more aggressive in China, Singapore and South Korea. In 2014, Chevrolet sold 700,000 cars in China, according to its 2014 global sales report.\nA spokesperson for Trump did not return our email.\nOur ruling\nTrump said Chevrolet cars in Tokyo don\u2019t exist.\nLiterally, that\u2019s not true. Chevy sells cars in Japan.\nHowever, Chevy sales are more like a trickle compared to the flood of Japanese brands in the market. A journalist who covers the auto industry in Japan told us visitors would not likely see a Chevy during their stay in Japan.\nTrump has a point here, but he should have used different words to make it.
