(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Similar claims have been shared widely in liberal Facebook groups and pages.\n\n(Screenshot from Facebook)\nWe reached out to the original poster for their evidence, but we haven\u2019t heard back.\nWe previously fact-checked whether federal agents detaining protesters in Portland are actually employees from Academi, a private military company formerly known as Blackwater. We rated that claim False.\nBut what about ZTI? We took a closer look.\nThere is no evidence that employees from ZTI Solutions, a small Virginia-based IT company, are patrolling demonstrations in Portland. The patch in the post actually reads \"ZT1\" \u2014\u00a0a unique identifier aimed at keeping the U.S. Marshal in the photo anonymous.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortlanders have been protesting against police brutality since the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody in late May. The demonstrations have sometimes turned violent, but the crowds are largely peaceful.\nThe Department of Homeland Security sent federal agents to Portland as part of the federal government\u2019s response to ongoing protests over police brutality. The forces are part of new \"rapid deployment teams\" that Homeland Security formed in response to an executive order from Trump that instructs federal agencies to provide \"personnel to assist with the protection of federal monuments, memorials, statues, or property.\" The U.S. Marshals Service also has officials in Portland.\nThe image in the Facebook post shows a U.S. Marshal.

Instead what we have, though, is a personal identifier,\" he said. \"So we have that so we can identify, and we have each identifier associated with a specific name so we have all that information internally.\"\nThe example Morgan gave during the press conference was \"DZ1.\" He also tweeted what the patches look like.\nContrary to reports, @CBP personnel wear patches that identify them as:CBP \u2714\ufe0fBorder Patrol \u2714\ufe0fPolice \u2714\ufe0fUnique agent identifier \u2714\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/YFgDs2NEPQ\u2014 CBP Mark Morgan (@CBPMarkMorgan) July 20, 2020 \nWe reached out to the U.S. Marshals Service for a comment, but we haven\u2019t heard back.\nZTI Solutions, whose website appears to be down, is a small business founded in 1997 and based in Edinburg, Va.
