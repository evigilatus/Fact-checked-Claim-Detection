Starting to get the picture.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStalking\nThe campaign mail cites an article from NewsMaxTV Las Vegas, an online news site run by Republican political operative Rob Lauer. Lauer is known for an unsuccessful bid for Nevada secretary of state and having his home searched by police in 2015 as part of a wide-ranging extortion investigation into a Nevada Assemblyman.\nThe article claims Silberkraus was detained by police in handcuffs for \"stalking\" his primary opponent.\nBut Silberkraus was never charged with or convicted of stalking.\nLas Vegas police said they had no records on file for an arrest or any incident involving Silberkraus, and a search of national and local court document sites revealed nothing filed against Silberkraus. \u00a0\nThe stalking claim originates with three-time state Assembly candidate Amy Groves, who most recently lost a June 2016 Republican primary contest to Silberkraus by 253 votes.\nGroves told PolitiFact that she called police after seeing Silberkraus taking pictures of a home she owns outside the Assembly district where she had filed to run.\nSilberkraus said he was attempting to collect evidence that Groves lived in that home outside the district, which would disqualify her from running. A handful of legislative candidates have been removed from the ballot in recent years after their opponents were able to prove that they didn\u2019t live in the district.\nGroves said she felt threatened because as a realtor, she was often responsible for evicting residents or overseeing collections, and said she felt threatened enough to call the police.\n\"We really panicked because it\u2019s a real threat in my industry,\" she said.\nGroves\u2019 husband blocked in Silberkraus\u2019 vehicle with his own car, and police questioned him for several minutes before letting him go. Silberkraus said he never felt like he was being detained, and that the photo in the ad was cropped to make it look like he was handcuffed.\n\"I\u2019ve never been handcuffed in my life,\" he said.\nRegardless, police have no arrest record or any record of Silberkraus being detained, and Groves said she didn\u2019t keep copies of any paperwork she filed with police about the incident.\nOur ruling\nA campaign mailer in a competitive Nevada Assembly race accuses Silberkraus of appearing in a \"sexual fetish film\" and being detained for \"stalking.\"\nSilberkraus did appear briefly as an extra in a 2006 movie that centered around a myriad of sexual fetishes. He says he doesn\u2019t agree with the film\u2019s message.\nThe stalking allegation holds less water, stemming from a primary opponent who accused him of stalking her several years ago. No official record exists, and he was not arrested.\nThe claim contains an element of truth but distorts facts to create an inaccurate impression. We rate it Mostly False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a51c9421-8057-40d7-93e6-1b77fcca1f14", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04188"}
