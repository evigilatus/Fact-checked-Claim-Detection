The report focuses on municipal, state and federal spending in Rhode Island.\n\nThe authors say the booklet \u00a0\"exposes over 300 pork projects, bungled boondoggles, bad ideas and examples of abuse of power that have resulted in the waste, fraud and abuse of more than $600 million of the taxpayers\u2019 hard-earned money.\"\n\nWe can\u2019t check on every example. But we were intrigued by one, related to federal stimulus spending, that OSPRI executive director Mike Stenhouse cited when publicizing the report on an appearance on WHJJ-920 AM\u2019s \"The Helen Glover Show.\"\n\nThe report says: \"The stimulus\u2019 $2 billion price tag alone doesn\u2019t tell the whole story of how tax dollars were spent \u2013 and wasted \u2013 in Rhode Island. In order to see the pork projects and frivolous spending hidden in the state\u2019s stimulus spending, it is necessary to take a closer look.\"\n\nIncluded on a list of \"some of the more dubious taxpayer-funded stimulus projects\" is \"$250,000 to provide digital television to the state\u2019s inmate population.\"\n\nOur antennae perked up: Did the state channel stimulus funds to digital TV for prisoners?\n\nThe item in the report is footnoted and includes the first in a series of links that \u00a0bring you to an OSPRI Web page with what appears to be a list of Department of Corrections projects. It includes $250,000 \u00a0\"to convert digital television signal.\"\n\nWe inquired about the project at the state Office of Economic Recovery and Reinvestment, which administers spending under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) \u00a0-- the formal name of the stimulus program. Deputy director Laurie Petrone reviewed records and got back to us.\n\n\"Under ARRA, they are not receiving any funds for that,\" she said.\n\nSo we contacted the corrections department\n\n\"There were no ARRA funds used for the digital conversion project,\" said spokeswoman Tracey Zeckhausen.\n\nWhen we related this to Stenhouse, he sent an e-mail with an attached state document that he said was where \"the specific information was originally drawn from.\"\n\nThe document heading reads, \"Office of Economic Recovery and Reinvestment\" and beneath that it says \"submitted requests under review, state agencies and state university.\" Beneath that, in larger red type, the phrase \"submitted requests under review\" is repeated.\n\nPetrone said those headings reflect that the document was merely a list of projects that various state agencies and institutions proposed as possible candidates for stimulus funding. The state compiled the list as it prepared to apply for stimulus money, she said. Ultimately, many did not receive ARRA funds, including the requested $250,000 for digital TV conversion at the Adult Correctional Institutions, she said.\n\nThe corrections department did undertake the project, however, using $143,000 in capital funds and $31,000 from its general fund to pay for work that ended up costing $174,000, Zeckhausen said. The sources of those revenues were state taxpayer dollars, she said.\n\nThe project, completed in early 2009, prepared the Adult Correctional Institutions for the federally mandated deadline for full-power TV stations to switch from analog to digital broadcasts. After that date, June 13, 2009, the prisons\u2019 analog TVs -- the only kind available at that time -- would have been unable to receive over-the-air broadcasts without special converter boxes and antennae.\n\nAnd, Zeckhausen noted, \"They do not get cable.\"\n\nThe ACI\u2019s 3,200 inmates watch TV in common areas and in their cells. In minimum security, as many as eight inmates may live in the same dormitory room and share one television. Inmates in old maximum security, who have no cellmates, have the exclusive choice of what to watch.\n\nThe 2009 project involved improvements to the ACI\u2019s existing antenna system, including rewiring and installing new components for reception of over-the-air digital broadcasts, Zeckhausen said. TVs are connected to the antenna wiring via a cable plugged into a cell wall.\n\nToday, inmates can purchase converter boxes for their analog TVs for $69 or buy new 13-inch digital flat-screen TVs for $191 (with clear backs to prevent the hiding of contraband). The TVs can receive about two dozen \u00a0stations, \u00a0including NBC, CBS, ABC and PBS outlets in Providence and Boston.\n\nWhy should inmates get to watch TV at all?\n\n\"An idle inmate can present a security risk. Keeping prisoners occupied is critical, and the opportunity to watch TV is one way to do that,\" Corrections Director A. T. Wall said in a statement. He also said that TV \"keeps inmates...in tune with current events, another factor in preparing them for life beyond the walls.\"\n\nBut our mission here isn\u2019t to judge whether such spending is, or is not, \u00a0\"dubious.\" It\u2019s to check on the accuracy of the report\u2019s claim.\n\nHere\u2019s what we found:\n\nOSPRI got two things right. The project was \"taxpayer-funded\" and it did provide digital television to the state\u2019s inmates.\n\nBut it got two big things wrong. First, the project didn\u2019t cost $250,000. The actual price was $174,000.\n\nAnd more important, it is not a \"stimulus project.\" OSPRI should have heeded the cautionary note in big red type on the document it cited. A call to the Office of Economic Recovery and Reinvestment would have cleared that up.\n\nWhen we told Stenhouse what we learned, he downplayed the source of the project\u2019s funding. The main purpose of the Piglet book, he said, is \" to list federal, state, and local expenditures of taxpayer dollars in R.I.\"\n\nIsn\u2019t the purpose of a 38-page report with 412 footnotes to get the facts right?\n\nFurthermore, the OSPRI report pointedly described federal stimulus spending as a \"litany of pricey and preposterous handouts\" in highlighting 17 local projects it said benefited from the program.\n\nWhen we asked Petrone about those other items, she said only 2 of the 17 won funding through the state. We can\u2019t delve into those here, but we\u2019re checking into whether any secured stimulus funding through some other means, if they received any public funding at all, and whether the projects were actually undertaken. (Download the report, go to page 32 and let us know the ones you\u2019re interested in.)\n\nThe Piglet Book authors got a bit lucky on this one. The fact that the ACI completed the project without stimulus funding saved their bacon from the flames of a Pants on Fire ruling. We rate this one False\n\n(Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.
