He offered big-picture ideas, the staples of conservative politics \u2014 shrinking government spending and lowering taxes.\n\nOne specific tax goal he reaffirmed that June 1 was to eliminate Ohio\u2019s state income tax.\n\nIt\u2019s a goal Kasich had mentioned in earlier speeches in the run-up to that formal announcement. And he left no doubt where he stood that day.\n\n\"We\u2019ll march over time to destroy that income tax that has sucked the vitality out of this state,\" Kasich roared.\n\nBut as time has marched on, a funny thing happened. Kasich has stopped calling for an elimination of Ohio\u2019s income tax. \n\nIt is absent from his campaign website, where he argues spending cuts are needed so taxes can be lowered. And at a speaking event Aug. 4, Kasich talked nearly an hour without mentioning the income tax repeal once.\n\nWe decided to run his remarks through the Flip-O-Meter to see if he\u2019s done a full gainer on the issue.\n\nWhen he launched his campaign, Kasich\u2019s call to eliminate the state income tax \u00a0was emphatic. But he has never detailed how he would \u00a0eliminate a major tax that provides much of the state\u2019s operating money. \n\nHe repeatedly has dodged reporter\u2019s questions for details about his plan. Full of disdain, he often would brush aside questions, sometimes snapping that he would discuss specifics when he was good and ready. Each week Kasich delivers campaign speeches across Ohio and it\u2019s common now for him to not mention his cornerstone policy issue. \n\nPerhaps growing weary of the questions, Kasich lately has softened his retorts and taken pains to be less bombastic and more assuring that he has not abandoned his idea.\n\n\"Nothing\u2019s changed on that. I\u2019m for reducing taxes,\" Kasich said to reporters Aug. 4 after his speech in Columbus. \u00a0\"Nothing has changed. But this idea of reducing these taxes, as I told you from the beginning, takes time.\n\n\"There\u2019s no obfuscation there at all. . . Nothing\u2019s changed about any of my programs or my plans.\"\n\nKasich was essentially forced to distance himself from his own idea when Republican state Rep. John Adams, of Sidney, near Dayton, last winter introduced a bill that would phase out the state\u2019s income tax. Democrats, who control the House, happily linked Adams\u2019 bill to Kasich\u2019s idea and gave the bill a series of hotly promoted committee hearings.\n\nIn January, the Legislative Service Commission, an independent state agency, released an analysis of Adams\u2019 bill and predicted the plan would cost Ohio more than $800 million next year and as much as $12 billion by 2020. In all, eliminating the state\u2019s income tax could blow a 40 percent hole in the general revenue fund, which could in turn impact police, fire and local government appropriations.\n\nThose details make Kasich\u2019s plan all the more intriguing. He insists it can be done, even as he refuses to offer up details or talk about it on the campaign trail. Sure Kasich says he\u2019s standing by his plan to eliminate the state\u2019s income tax but his silence on the campaign trail about an issue he once was so boastful about speaks volumes.\n\nHis unwillingness to answer questions or provide details about how he would eliminate the tax makes it appear as if he wishes he never promised its demise so prominently. \n\nHe hasn\u2019t publicly gone that far, yet, so we rate his position a Half Flip.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-14603"}
