Two million Latinos live in poverty today more than it was when President Obama took an oath of office less than eight years ago. Another 14 million people have left the entire workforce. Household income has declined by more than $4,000 since 2000. This is 16 years ago.\" Here, we will focus on the latter part of that statement - that is, household income has declined by more than $4,000 since 2000. On the numbers, Trump's right. Once adjusted to inflation, the average household income fell from $57,724 in 2000 to $53,657 in 2014, the last full year for which data are available. This is a reduction of $4,067 - in line with Tramp's statement. This chart shows the trend since 2000. But it is worth noting one thing in the context. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" By Samantha Buterman on January 11, 2021, while this census came in the middle of a series of shots in President Barack Obama, the majority of the period that Trump indicated was under George W. Bush, a Republican. During the first eight years of the Trump period referred to -- 2000 to 2008 -- Bush was president. During the Bush State period, the average inflation-adjusted household income fell by $2,411, more than half of the total amount that declined between 2000 and 2014. Since Obama took office, it has been reduced by $1,656. This is not a great legacy, but it is worth remembering that cutting numbers in this way puts all the great recession on Obama's head while also denying Obama 2015, when recovery was slow but steady, because data are not available. Our governor, Trump, said, \"The house's income has fallen over $4,000 since 2000. He's on the right number. However, for a census rooted in a series of attacks on Obama, it overestimates the income trend under the current President. Most of the decline in real household income has already occurred since 2000 under the presidency of the President of the Republic. The statement is accurate but requires additional information, so we often appreciate it. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/dd9bd01f-4542-406b-b87e-313c218b1d3", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04629"}
