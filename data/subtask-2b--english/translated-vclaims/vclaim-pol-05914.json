On September 28, 2015, the media event, Trump described the unemployment rate within 5 percent as \"such a fake number.\" He said, \"The number doesn't reflect,\" he said. \"I've seen 24% numbers -- I've actually seen 42% unemployment. 42%.\" Follow up, 5.3% unemployment -- that's the biggest joke there is in this country. The unemployment rate is probably 20%, but I'll tell you, you have great economists, they'll tell you it's 30, 32. And the highest I've heard so far is 42 percent.\" We have previously assessed a false claim by Trump that \"our true hero is anywhere from 18 to 20 percent.\" If the 18 to 20 percent ratio is false, how can it be 42 percent? We've had a good look. We will begin by providing new information on how to calculate the official unemployment rate. The Bureau of Labour Statistics, a federal agency, uses surveys and statistical sampling to calculate the number of Americans who are or are not employed. In order to calculate the unemployment rate, the Agency divides the number of unemployed persons (which includes only those who have recently sought employment) among the total population seeking employment and workers. Persons who are not currently looking for work have not been taken into account in this calculation. This is the part of the population that tries to take alternative measures - such as those mentioned by Tramp - into account. In general, the proponents of these alternative measures argue that non-employment, regardless of cause, amounts to unemployment, and should be reflected as such in official measurements. The 42% account we asked the Trump campaign for a 42% source, but they didn't respond. However, the fact checker followed him to the David Stockman column, which was President Ronald Reagan &apos; s budget manager. Stockman calculated that there are currently 210 million Americans between the ages of 16 and 68 -- what he calls an \"impossible measure of potential workforce.\" If I assume that each of these people is able to maintain a full-time job, he writes, they will offer a total of 420 billion potential work hours. However, during 2014, Stockman noted that the Bureau of Labour Statistics had recorded only 240 billion hours of work. If you run the numbers, \"The real unemployment rate was 42.9%,\" Stockman wrote. The economists say that Stockman's way of looking at the question -- using actual working hours divided by the theoretical maximum that could have worked, rather than determining whether individuals are working or unemployed -- is provocative. But they say that this raw measure has serious flaws. In the column, Stockman himself admits that this number is incomplete, although his accent fluctuates when he does. \"Yes, we have to allow unemployed wives, students, disabled, early retirees and coupon scissors,\" books. \"We also have wanderers, crooks, social welfare frauds, bums and people in between jobs, enrolled in training programs, And apart from Snark, economists say this warning is crucial. According to Gary Bertellis, an economist at the Brookings Institution, the Stockman account, \"persons voluntarily working part-time hours are treated as partially unemployed, even if they have excellent reasons for wanting to take up a part-time job only, such as raising children, attending school or college, disability, or moving to retirement.\" \"Many of the shortage of full-time and part-time work is entirely reasonable, as is the worker's decision not to work or to seek paid employment at all.\" In other words, Trump's belief in the accuracy of 42 per cent is misplaced. Taking another blow to the figures all this highlights a long-term discussion between economists about whether there is a better way to calculate the unemployment rate than those traditionally used. Within the mainstream economy, the traditional method of producing 5.1 per cent is thought to be extremely limited, even if the more lenient calculation of 42 per cent is highly exaggerated. The Office of Labour Statistics itself provides a more extensive alternative measure of employment \"deficit employment\" called the U-6 rate. The U-6 rate includes both those who are officially \"unemployed\" and those who work part-time for economic reasons and those who are \"frequently associated\" with the labour force, which means that they want to work but have not sought employment recently enough to be considered active in the labour force. The unemployment rate currently stands at 10.3 per cent, double the official unemployment rate. For the sake of argument, we decided to see whether we could reach a percentage close to Trump 42 per cent. We started with 94 million Americans aged 16 and over who are not working, unemployed, (3) in the army, or (4) institutionally. We then put forward the number of people who have good reasons for not working or seeking work. Here's a summary on this subject. On January 9, 2021, on Twitter, Sarah Goodlowski stated: \"Not all women lost their jobs (in December's job report), most of them black and Latin women. In fact, white women got a job. If this is converted into a new type of unemployment rate, it goes up to 16.4 per cent. This is higher than the U-6 rate of 10.3 per cent, but only a small part of the 42 per cent claimed by Trump. As Bertellis told us earlier, most of those who suffer from being \"out-of-work\" can in fact be seen as benefiting from their membership in a rich and technologically advanced society. \"The fact that these adults are unemployed is not an indicator of economic failure - it is an indicator of a very prosperous society that can allow older persons and persons with disabilities to retire, which can invest in young adults so that they can improve their skills, which can keep some adults at home where they can take care of children or take care of other unpaid endeavours,\" he said. This isn't the first time Trump used 42%. In August, our friends in Washington's fact-checker gave a similar statement from Trump Four Pinocchios, the hardest classification of honesty in the column. Trump then repeated this at his tax plan press conference. Our judgement in Tramp continues to reiterate that the unemployment rate may be as high as 42 per cent. However, obtaining a percentage of this rise requires the belief that being a student in high school, college or graduate studies, a senior citizen, a parent residing at home, a participant in job training, or having a disability is no excuse for not keeping a job, or for work less than 40 hours a week. The highest alternative measure to the unemployment rate we can find, which had any credibility, was 16.4 per cent, and even this exaggerated figure is about one third of the road to 42 per cent in Trump. We assess his claim of pants on fire. Correction, February 11, 2016: We updated this story to reflect some changes in the statistics for students listed in the table. Our new account puts the highest \"employment\" rate we can produce at 16.4 per cent. The evaluation remains pants on fire. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/1b7360a0-5e27-41f2-a541-c0e4766632219", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05914"}
