Rick Perry, rating as Mostly True his claim that Texas had \"the fourth-lowest debt per capita of any state in the nation, and we are the lowest of any of the big states.\"\nHow does debt shake out at the local level?\nMedina, a tea-party favorite from Wharton, got 19 percent of the vote in the 2010 Republican gubernatorial primary against Gov. Rick Perry and Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison.\nThe Medina campaign told us via email that her Texas-New York comparison was based on a Sept. 26, 2012, report, \"Your Money and Local Debt,\" issued by the current state comptroller, Susan Combs.\nIn 2009, Texas had $7,983 in local debt per capita, the report said, placing Texas second among the 10 most populous states. New York was first with $8,744 in local debt per capita; California was third with $6,469 per capita.\nTexas comptroller report, \"Your Money and Local Debt,\" Sept. 26, 2012, based on 2009 data:\nThe report relied on 2009 U.S. Census Bureau data, which Combs spokesman R.J. DeSilva told us via email was drawn from the December 2011 annual report of the Texas Bond Review Board. That agency oversees the issuance of state bonds used to fund activities as varied as making housing loans to veterans and helping local governments finance water projects.\n\"State and local debt\" are defined in the bureau\u2019s July 2013 summary of 2011 data as \"all interest-bearing short-term credit obligations and all long-term obligations incurred in the name of the government and all its dependent agencies, whether used for public or private purposes.\"\nU.S. states divide local and state responsibilities in different ways. Texas spends little at the state level; local costs may be borne by hospital districts, school districts and the like in addition to city and county governments. The Census and Board both presented local debt estimates alongside state debt.\nWe next looked for comparisons using more recent data and all 50 states.\nThe Bond Review Board offers its own annual estimate of local debt in Texas. In the most recent report that was available when Medina\u2019s release was sent out, published in December 2012, the agency said Texas\u2019 local debt per capita was $7,507 in the fiscal year that ran through August 2011.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoard spokesman Robert Latsha told us by phone that, though he wasn\u2019t certain exactly what the Census included in its figures, it\u2019s likely the largest difference between the Census and board estimates comes from debt set up by quasi-governmental agencies such as local housing finance corporations or economic development corporations.\nOnly debt from bonds and shorter-term securities issued by local governments is reported to the board, Latsha said.\nHe said the board didn\u2019t calculate comparisons with all 50 states. Census Bureau spokesman Joseph Dalaker told us by phone that the bureau didn\u2019t either, but he helped us find data comparable to what the board probably used when comparing the 10 biggest states.\nUsing those Census estimates of local debt and state population -- from the most recent data sets available when Medina spoke in November 2013 -- we found Texas was third among all 50 states and, again, second among the 10 most populous.\nHighest local debt per capita among all 50 states:\n\nNew York\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 $10,204\nNevada \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 $8,520\nTexas\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 $8,431\nCalifornia\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 $7,075\nKansas\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 $7,011\nColorado\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 $6,911\nWashington\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 $6,660\nMinnesota\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 $6,295\nIllinois\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 $6,267\nKentucky\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 $6,259\n\nSources: U.S. Census Bureau population estimates, July 12, 2012, and local debt estimates, Dec. 6, 2012\nIn the board\u2019s December 2013 report, which came out after Medina made her statement, the state board updated local debt per capita in fiscal 2012 to $7,514 by its own estimation and $8,431 according to Census data, keeping Texas in second place among the 10 most populous states.\nMedina\u2019s claim referred to the debt burden falling on \"citizens.\" But state residents might not be directly on the hook for the whole amount.\nDalaker told us, \"You really have to tease out who\u2019s paying.\" For example, taxes on tourists can help pay for projects, he said.\nMoody\u2019s Investors Service spokesman David Jacobson told us by phone, \"What\u2019s more important is your ability to pay back that debt and how it is structured.\" Many Texas entities have good credit, he said.\nOur ruling\nMedina said, \"At present spending levels, only citizens of New York have a greater local debt burden than Texans,\" but without mentioning that her comparison was based on the 10 most-populated states.\nTexas is second among the big states and third among all 50 in recent estimates. We rate her statement as True.\n\nTRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate and there\u2019s nothing significant missing.\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08531"}
