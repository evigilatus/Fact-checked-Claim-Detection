Several said they suspected antifa activists were to blame.\nThe Douglas County Sheriff\u2019s Office has debunked the rumor that it arrested six antifa activists in connection with fires in the area, which is located south of Eugene, Ore.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Rumors spread just like wildfire and now our 9-1-1 dispatchers and professional staff are being overrun with requests for information and inquiries on an UNTRUE rumor that 6 Antifa members have been arrested for setting fires in DOUGLAS COUNTY, OREGON,\" the sheriff\u2019s office wrote in a Sept. 10 Facebook post. \"THIS IS NOT TRUE!\"\nWe asked Romero about the first claim in his tweet \u2014\u00a0that a \"pallet company\" in Oregon City, Ore., caught an \"antifa arsonist\" on camera. He said he couldn\u2019t remember the name of the company, but a source told him it was caught on video surveillance and \"they\u2019re withholding it.\"\nWe called the only pallet company listed in the Oregon City white pages. It moved to a nearby city several years ago and said it hasn\u2019t had a fire. A fire at a pallet company north of Oregon City did take place Sept. 8, but we could find no evidence it was caused by an antifa activist.\n\"This is not a conspiracy theory \u2014 this is a conspiracy,\" Romero said. \"This is obviously a planned and coordinated event.\"\nRELATED: Antifa activists did not start the West Coast wildfires\nThat claim, and Romero\u2019s tweet, has been amplified by supporters of the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory. The rumors have inspired some armed groups to patrol fire-prone areas in Oregon.\nBut multiple police departments and fire officials across the state say there\u2019s no evidence that the wildfires are part of a \"politically-driven arson campaign.\" All evidence points to a mix of drought, high winds, historic heat and fires set by an influx of people trying to enjoy the outdoors during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\"Many of the fires currently burning in Oregon are still under investigation so I don\u2019t have confirmation of cause,\" said Joy Krawczyk, a public affairs manager for the Oregon Department of Forestry. \"That being said, I haven\u2019t seen or heard anything that indicates that the statewide wildfires we\u2019re battling are the result of a coordinated, politically-driven arson campaign.\"\nRomero\u2019s tweet rates False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18912"}
