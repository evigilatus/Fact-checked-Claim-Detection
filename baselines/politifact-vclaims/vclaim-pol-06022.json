In a Sunday interview on ABC\u2019s This Week, however, host Martha Raddatz took the opportunity to ask the Vermont senator about an issue that isn\u2019t even included on his campaign website -- foreign policy.\nRaddatz asked Sanders to explain his vote against the 1991 Gulf war and his opposition to increased military action in Syria and Iraq, compared to his support for military action in Afghanistan after Sept. 11, 2011.\nSanders said he thought the United States could have forced Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait without invading, and that military action should be \"the last resort, not the first resort.\"\n\"The United States cannot do it alone,\" Sanders added. \"In the Middle East, Saudi Arabia has the third-largest military budget in the entire world. They're going to have to get in and take on ISIS as well as other countries in that region. The United States should be supportive. We should be working with other countries. But the United States cannot always be the only country involved in these wars.\"\nWe wondered about Sanders\u2019 claim that Saudi Arabia, with a population roughly the size of\u00a0Texas,\u00a0has the \"third-largest military budget in the entire world.\"\nSanders\u2019 campaign pointed us to the latest statistics from the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), widely cited as an authoritative source for international security statistics. We looked at IISS figures for a separate defense-related fact-check last year.\nAccording to estimates from the IISS, Saudi Arabia did have the world\u2019s third-largest military budget in 2014, at around $80.8 billion. Its budget was smaller than only those of China and the United States. \u00a0\n\nAnother reputable group, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), catalogues the security expenditures of 171 countries every year.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn that list, Saudi Arabia ranked fourth in 2014, behind the United States, China and Russia.\nWhy the difference? SIPRI estimates that Russia spent around $84 billion on defense in 2014, almost $14 billion more than the IISS estimates it budgeted.\nThe dataset\u2019s footnotes, however, make clear that Saudi Arabia likely spent much more than $80 billion on military-related activities in 2014. SIPRI says its numbers \"may not include billions of dollars of military aid for Lebanon and Egypt that was announced in 2013 and 2014.\"\nSaudi Arabia hasn\u2019t always spent this much on its military. Its defense budget has grown fourfold in the last 10 years, from around $20 billion in 2004 to $80 billion in 2014, an increase that reflects the intensification of the Saudis\u2019 military involvement in the rest of the Middle East.\nFor the record, SIPRI\u2019s best estimates for military expenditures in North Korea and Iran are significantly below the budget of Saudi Arabia\u2019s defense.\nOur ruling\nSanders said, \"Saudi Arabia has the third-largest military budget in the entire world.\"\nWhile there are a few different ways to calculate this statistic, both studies we looked at placed the size of Saudi Arabia\u2019s military budget at or near No. 3 in the world.\nWe rate Sanders\u2019 claim True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06022"}
