Her figures for California\u2019s per inmate costs were eye-opening.\n\"Let\u2019s look at the fact that there is an issue around how much we are paying \u2014 and again, this gets back to the economic cost \u2014 it costs us about $33,000 a year to lock somebody up. In California it costs about $75,000 a year,\" Harris said on July 18, 2017.\n\nHarris makes her claim at about the 16:50 minute mark in the video above.\nHarris made criminal justice reform a top priority during her time as California\u2019s attorney general and has done the same so far in the Senate. Recently, she teamed up with Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., to push bipartisan bail reform legislation that would prevent minor offenders from sitting in jail if they can\u2019t afford the cost of being released before trial.\nIn discussing prison costs, Harris said governments should place a greater focus on crime prevention and drug treatment given the high cost of incarceration.\nWe interpreted Harris's claim about per inmate expenses to mean the operational costs to house male and female inmates, including security, health care, facility upkeep and employee compensation.\nAdvocates for criminal justice reform often argue that just looking at the operational costs of running prisons ignores the social costs of incarcerating Americans.\nWe looked at those costs as well, but based our rating primarily on the evidence supporting the numbers Harris cited in her Women Unshackled appearance.\nOur research\nA spokesperson for Harris provided us with data on the cost of federal incarceration, from the independent Vera Institute of Justice, as well as numbers for California, based on Gov. Jerry Brown\u2019s spending plan for the 2017-18 fiscal year.\nIn its May 2017 report \"The Price of Prisons,\" the Vera Institute examined the cost to house inmates at prisons nationwide. It obtained data for 45 states and found the total cost per inmate averaged $33,274. The institute advocates for reducing inmate totals and improving conditions in prisons. It reported receiving about three-quarters of its funding from the federal government.\nThe study\u2019s findings support Harris\u2019 claim on the average cost of housing inmates nationally. But what about the California\u2019s per inmate price of $75,000?\nFor that figure, Harris\u2019 spokesman cited a June 2017 article by the Associated Press. It estimated the cost per inmate would reach a record $75,560 in the current fiscal year. The AP based its estimate on the money Gov. Brown set aside in this year\u2019s budget for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.\nTo verify this figure and put it in context, we examined the governor\u2019s 2017-18 budget and contacted the Brown Administration\u2019s corrections and finance departments, as well as the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office.\nThese sources pointed us to the projected $76,320 cost per inmate in Brown\u2019s 2017-18 budget. That qualifies as \"about $75,000\" as Harris put it.\nA spokeswoman for the state\u2019s corrections department told us California paid about $73,000 per inmate last fiscal year, also very close to Harris\u2019 number.\nCost in context\nWhile Harris\u2019 numbers are nearly spot on, we wanted to know what\u2019s driving this high cost to lock up prisoners in California.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in remarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe expense to house each inmate has doubled since 2005, even as court orders reduced the prison population by about a quarter, according to the Associated Press.\nSeveral reasons account for the dramatic increase. Viewed simply, fewer inmates combined with higher corrections spending equals a higher per capita cost.\nBut why are there fewer inmates and higher spending?\nCalifornia was forced to cut inmate levels after a 2011 U.S. Supreme Court decision found that overcrowding in prisons violated constitutional protections against cruel and unusual punishment.\nThe drop in inmates hasn\u2019t led to the closure of any prisons and hasn\u2019t led to a reduction of prison staffing that corresponds directly to the drop in inmates.\nJonathan Peterson, an analyst at the Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office, said that\u2019s because there are security requirements at the prisons that don\u2019t allow for the elimination of guards simply because there are fewer inmates.\n\"Regardless of how many inmates are in a particular unit, you still need the one guard to open and close the doors,\" Peterson said.\nThe governor\u2019s budget expects a nearly 2-to-1 inmate to prison staff ratio for the current fiscal year. That\u2019s down from a ratio of a 2.24-to-1 just two years ago.\nHigher employee costs\nJust as the inmate population started to drop, employee compensation in the prison system jumped significantly. The corrections department budget has gone up $1.2 billion since 2012 due to employee compensation and retirement costs, according to the Department of Finance. Of that increase, $436 million is directly tied to increased pension contributions by the state for prison employees.\nAdditionally, in July 2013, the state opened the California Health Care Facility providing 2,600 beds for inmates needing medical attention. The facility has cost $288 million since it opened, the finance department reported.\nCalifornia voters have contributed to the shrinking prison population in recent years by approving ballot measures that reclassify many felony drug and property crimes as misdemeanors and improving chances for parole for offenders classified as nonviolent.\nThese measures are expected to further reduce the prison population by thousands of inmates. If that happens and prison employee costs rise or stay stable, California\u2019s per capita inmate expense will continue to be higher than other states.\nOur ruling\nSen. Kamala Harris recently claimed \"it costs us about $33,000 a year (nationally) to lock somebody up. In California it costs about $75,000 a year.\"\nA recent study that examined costs in 45 states plus data from California\u2019s departments of corrections and finance support the senator\u2019s statement.\nDigging deeper, we found reducing inmates in California\u2019s prisons, which Harris supports, may actually increase the per capita costs she highlights.\nThat will be especially true if salary and pension costs continue to increase as inmate numbers drop. Harris doesn\u2019t make a specific claim about what\u2019s driving these costs.\nHer statement centers on the costs alone to house inmates nationally and in California.\nThe evidence supports the figures she cited.\nWe rate Harris' claim True.\n\nTRUE\u00a0\u2013 The statement is accurate and there\u2019s nothing significant missing.\nClick here for\u00a0more\u00a0on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.\nPolitiFact California intern Eli Flesch contributed research and writing to this fact check.\n Share the Facts 2017-08-10 00:40:57 UTC   PolitiFact    6 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: True  \"It costs us about $33,000 a year (on average nationally) to lock somebody up.
