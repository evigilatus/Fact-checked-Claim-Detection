We found that he overstated the degree to which the United States\u2019 military investments have gone toward restoring the military\u2019s equipment and capabilities.\nThe White House did not respond to requests for comment.\nTrump\u2019s number includes future 2020 spending\nExperts pointed us to the total defense budgets for the last four fiscal years, which run from October through September.\nIn the 2017 fiscal year, which began under President Barack Obama and extended into Trump\u2019s term, $606 billion was spent on defense. In the 2018 fiscal year, that number was $670.6 billion.\u00a0\nThe 2019 fiscal year saw $685 billion enacted for defense. And for the 2020 fiscal year, Trump signed a bill in December \u2014 three months after the fiscal year began \u2014 that authorized $738 billion for the Pentagon.\nSo, the total amount of money earmarked for defense under Trump comes out to nearly $2.7 trillion, which is slightly higher than his talking point.\nBut counter to Trump\u2019s framing, not all of that money has been spent. Trump lumped the $738 billion for 2020 that he approved in December into his $2.5 trillion cost estimate. At a little more than three months into the fiscal year, that money will take time to serve its purpose.\nRebuilding the military would also require new equipment that can take years to build and develop; it isn\u2019t likely that the funds just allocated for 2020 have already been used to assemble new ships, submarines, fighter jets and weapons, as Trump\u2019s claim suggested.\u00a0\u00a0\nPlus, only some of the money dedicated to defense has gone toward procurement, or buying and upgrading equipment. It hasn\u2019t all been put toward a complete overhaul.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Pentagon spent roughly $419 billion on procurement through the first three fiscal years of Trump\u2019s presidency, and Congress appropriated about $143.5 billion more in the spending bill Trump signed for the 2020 fiscal year, bringing that total to about $562.5 billion.\nThe rest of the defense dollars over the last four years have been directed toward research and development, military personnel, and operation and maintenance costs, among other things.\nExperts also noted that the bulk of the $2.5 trillion would have been spent anyway, regardless of who was president.\n\"Most of that money was going to be spent under Obama,\" said Michael O\u2019Hanlon, a senior fellow in foreign policy at the Brookings Institution. \"Trump\u2019s net increases have been about $100 billion each year, or $400 billion total compared with earlier expectations.\"\nThe administration\u2019s scaled-up defense spending has helped make troops and equipment more ready for combat, O\u2019Hanlon said. But overall, Trump\u2019s claim of a total rebuild is \"hyperbole.\"\u00a0\n\"Most weapons are the same as before,\" O\u2019Hanlon said. \"There is more continuity than change in defense policy from Obama to Trump.\"\nAccording to an index of the military\u2019s strength by the conservative Heritage Foundation, the military currently receives a grade of \"marginal.\"\n\"The active component of the U.S. military is two-thirds the size it should be, operates equipment that is older than should be the case, and is burdened by readiness levels that are problematic,\" the report concluded.\n\"The current U.S. military force is likely capable of meeting the demands of a single major regional conflict while also attending to various presence and engagement activities,\" it said. \"It would be very hard-pressed to do more.\"\nOur ruling\nTrump said, \"The American military has been completely rebuilt under my administration at a cost of $2.5 trillion.\"\nThe military is far from \"completely rebuilt.\" The Trump administration has made some strides in improving the military\u2019s operational readiness, but most weapons and infrastructure are the same as they were before Trump took office.\nThe element of truth is in Trump\u2019s $2.5 trillion number, which comes from the total defense budgets for the last four fiscal years.\u00a0\nStill, not all of that money has been spent, and not all of it has gone toward what would be considered a rebuild under any reasonable definition of the phrase.\nWe rate this statement Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17559"}
