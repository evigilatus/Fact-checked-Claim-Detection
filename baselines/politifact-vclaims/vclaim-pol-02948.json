Dworkin also posted the video on DailyKos.com.\nMost critics tended to especially focus on Pence\u2019s line, \"Congress must ensure that a catastrophe of nature does not become a catastrophe of debt for our children and grandchildren.\"\nDid Pence really cite the Bible while demanding that Congress not fund Katrina relief?\nConsidering cuts\nPence spoke in a one-minute speech on the House floor on Sept. 8, 2005, shortly after Katrina wreaked havoc on the Gulf Coast by making landfall near New Orleans on Aug. 29. The brevity of his remarks allows us to consider his statement in full:\n\n\"Mr. Speaker, Katrina breaks my heart. When I consider its tragic aftermath, the ancient parable comes to mind: \u2018And the rains descended and the flood came and the winds blew and beat against the house and it fell with a great crash.\u2019\n\"For most American families, when a tree falls on your house, you tend to the wounded, you rebuild, and then you figure out how you are going to pay for it. Later today Congress will continue the work of funding the relief and recovery from Hurricane Katrina, and well we should, by speeding more than $50 billion to FEMA and other agencies.\n\"But as we tend to the wounded, as we begin to rebuild, let us also do what every other American family would do, in like circumstances, and expects this Congress to do: let us figure out how we\u2019re going to pay for it.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin Nunes\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in an interview on Fox\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRepublicans have no way to communicate\u201d after tech companies cut off Parler.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Amy Sherman \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Congress must ensure that a catastrophe of nature does not become a catastrophe of debt for our children and grandchildren.\"\n\nThe parable to which he refers is a Bible verse, but it\u2019s actually Matthew 7:27, not 7:25 as the tweet said. (The wording is very similar.) In context, the parable is about believing in the true God in the face of temptation or suffering, although here Pence is clearly playing off the idea of building on stable ground.\nWhile the tweet that\u2019s been shared said Pence urged Congress not to approve Katrina aid, the video that accompanied the piece \u2014 and Pence\u2019s full remarks \u2014 actually support the opposite conclusion. Pence did not oppose any aid for Katrina victims. He said in his remarks that Congress should pay for relief efforts.\nPence joined the vast majority of lawmakers who voted later that same day in favor of a $51.8 billion relief package, which passed 410-11. The bill then passed the Senate 97-0 and was signed into law by President George W. Bush.\nWhat Pence was saying is that Congress should not go into debt to pay for the aid package, and find other solutions to offset costs.\nIt\u2019s no secret Pence is a fan of reducing government spending.\nAs chairman of the Republican Study Group, a collection of very conservative legislators, Pence did propose cutting or delaying spending on some projects to offset the costs of rebuilding the Gulf Coast. Their plan was even called \"Operation Offset.\" Among the group\u2019s targets were a prescription drug benefit for seniors and transportation projects.\nBut even as Pence and other congressional Republicans looked to find cuts to curtail a budget deficit, he did not propose holding up Katrina relief. He continued his cost-cutting rhetoric a couple of weeks later, when he discussed cutting \"big-ticket items\" from the budget to deal with Katrina spending.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nOur ruling\nBloggers said a video showed Pence quoting the Bible as justification for \"Congress not to fund Katrina relief effort.\"\nThey cited a short 2005 floor speech in which Pence said Katrina relief should pass, but then Congress should look to cut costs elsewhere. He did not hold the aid bill hostage, even while making cost-cutting a personal priority. (The tweet we\u2019re citing also was a bit off about which particular Bible verse he used.)\nCritics are misrepresenting Pence\u2019s comments, which are plain just from watching the video.
