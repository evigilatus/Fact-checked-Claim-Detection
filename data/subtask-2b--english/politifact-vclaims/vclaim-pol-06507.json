Its April 14, 2015 post quoted the \"same knowledgeable sources\" confirming another ISIS cell to the west of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, \u00a0targeting the New Mexico towns of Columbus and Deming.\nScary stuff if so.\nSimilar claims not substantiated\nWe\u2019ve found a lack of substance to similar claims.\nIn September 2014, PolitiFact in Washington, D.C. found no independent or law-enforcement corroboration of a statement that \"ISIS is present in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez.\" National security experts advised it\u2019s unlikely ISIS would operate in Mexico and stage an attack by crossing the border.\nThe next month, we rated Pants on Fire a congressman\u2019s claim that at least 10 ISIS fighters had been caught in Texas after coming across the border and there are \"dozens more that did not get caught by the Border Patrol.\" When we inquired, a Homeland Security spokeswoman, Marsha Catron, called the claim \"categorically false.\" By email, Catron said the department \"continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border.\"\nJudicial Watch: Identifying sources \u2018would get them killed\u2019\nFor this fact check, we asked Judicial Watch, an educational foundation that says it focuses on ensuring political and judicial officials do not abuse their powers, to elaborate on its post.\nBy phone, Christopher Farrell, its director of investigations and research, told us the web post did not identify the two key sources because neither one was authorized to speak on the record and identifying them \"would get them killed.\"\nOther authorities, government agencies see no fire\nSeparately, we asked security experts about the claim. Daniel Byman, a Georgetown University professor, emailed: \"It's hard for me to say there definitely isn't something there, though I'd be very surprised if this were true. You'd want someone from FBI or DHS to confirm/deny.\"\nWe tried that tack; agencies signaled skepticism.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHomeland Security\u2019s Catron referred us to the National Security Council whose spokesman, Alistair Baskey, said by email: \"There is no indication that this claim has any validity to it.\" Meantime, an FBI spokesman left a voice message with us responding to our inquiry. El Paso-based Michael Martinez said: \"As far as we\u2019re concerned, there is no credible information to support that.\"\nWe also called Mexico\u2019s embassy in Washington, D.C. By email, the embassy\u2019s press office provided a denial evidently prepared the day Judicial Watch made its post: \"The government of Mexico dismisses and categorically denies each of the statements made today by the organization Judicial Watch on the alleged presence of ISIS's operating cells throughout the border region, particularly at Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Chihuahua - El Paso, Texas.\" The embassy said \"relevant authorities operating in the region have also confirmed the nonexistence of these activities with their U.S. counterparts, with whom they will continue to work closely and to exchange information at our common border.\"\nTexas Department of Public Safety: 'No credible information'\nIn Texas, we reached Tom Vinger, spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety, who said by email the agency \"has no credible information to corroborate or validate this story.\"\nWe were struck by the reaction of Monica Varela, a public information officer for the El Paso County sheriff\u2019s office. After we summarized the Judicial Watch conclusion there\u2019s an ISIS camp in Mexico near El Paso, Varela said by phone: \"Holy Jesus Christ.\"\nLater, Chris Acosta, the department\u2019s public affairs director, said by email the department couldn\u2019t provide relevant information; after all, its deputies don\u2019t patrol the Mexico side of the border.\nAlso in El Paso, Victor Manjarrez, a former longtime U.S. Border Patrol official and associate director of the National Center for Border Security & Immigration at the University of Texas at El Paso, told us he didn\u2019t find the Judicial Watch item believable -- in part because the described location of the camp is a suburb of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez that\u2019s modern by Mexican standards. Generally, Manjarrez said by phone, the group\u2019s statement is \"really silly.\"\nJudical Watch stands by its post\nWe shared what we\u2019d gathered with Judicial Watch. By phone, Farrell said the center stands by its item. He questioned the credibility of Manjarrez, who he described as retiring from the Border Patrol under a cloud. \"He may not be the most authoritative expert,\" Farrell said. Manjarrez later said by phone he went to court in connection with his retirement to make sure he was fully paid for his service and ended up happy with the outcome; he said he also signed a nondisclosure agreement.\nOur ruling\nJudicial Watch said it confirmed ISIS has a camp in Mexico a few miles from El Paso.\nU.S., Mexico and Texas officials told us they had no information to validate or corroborate this bombshell. Lacking any on-the-record indication of the claim's accuracy, we rate it False.\n\nFALSE \u2013 The statement is not accurate.\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06507"}
