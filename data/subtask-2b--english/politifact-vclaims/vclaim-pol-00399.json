Now, she\u2019s under scrutiny for disrespecting the flag.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"This is Kelley O\u2019Hara,\" began a July 8 Facebook post with a photo of one of Rapinoe\u2019s teammates. \"She is the women\u2019s soccer player who rushed to rescue the American flag after it was thrown down on the field and stomped on by her idiot teammates. Kelli Ohara (sic) is the true face of real feminism. Lets (sic) make HER famous instead of the square jawed haters with the bad dye jobs dissing the flag for attention.\"\u00a0\nThe reference to bad dye jobs is an apparent dig at Rapinoe, whose blonde hair was purple during the World Cup matches.\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

(You can watch the clip here.)\n\"You should be disturbed by this unpatriotic narcissistic behavior,\" he wrote. \"@mPinoe is neither a hero or a role model.

She hands the trophy to Rapinoe and then drops the flag as she, Rapinoe and Morgan begin what looks like a choreographed move that ends with them throwing their hands in the air. Rapinoe\u2019s foot appears to come into contact with the flag as the players start shuffling forward but O\u2019Hara darts into the frame and Long picks the flag back up and hands it to her.\nThe incident received some news coverage, including from Fox News, which reported that \"Long came under fire for briefly dropping the American flag during her celebration with Golden Boot winner and outspoken Trump critic Megan Rapinoe.\"\nFox doesn\u2019t say that any of the players stomped on the flag. And here, we think words matter. While it\u2019s true that Long dropped the flag on the ground for a few seconds during the team\u2019s celebration, to say that players stomped on it suggests something more sinister than what took place.\u00a0\nBut more than that, it doesn\u2019t appear that anyone even stepped on the flag. After Rapinoe takes a step forward, Long is able to pick it up.\nIn the Facebook post\u2019s comments, some Facebook users cheered O\u2019Hara on. But others were skeptical of how the account had framed what happened on the field after the U.S. team beat the Netherlands 2-0.\u00a0\n\"Thank you for picking up our flag,\" one man said. \"I watched that video a couple times. I never saw any of those girls step on the flag. Kelley got it before they could. I won\u2019t pretend to see something to make liberals look bad. I don\u2019t have too (sic). They do enough obvious stuff.\"\nWe rate this Facebook post as False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00399"}
