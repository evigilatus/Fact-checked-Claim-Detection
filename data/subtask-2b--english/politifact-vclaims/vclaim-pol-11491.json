Her speech was on Feb. 15. Like any other State of the County address, Nash spoke proudly of Gwinnett\u2019s progress, including a list of achievements that sounded impressive.\n\nPolitiFact Georgia wondered whether two of these claims, particularly with all the talk about jobs and unemployment, were correct.\n\n\"[E]mployment in Gwinnett is up more than 3 percent over last year, and unemployment is the lowest of the five core metro counties,\" Nash told an audience of county leaders and boosters.\n\nFirst, we wondered which counties was Nash referring to in her speech. Her communications director, Joe Sorenson, said they are the counties with the five largest populations: Clayton, Cobb, DeKalb, Fulton and Gwinnett.\n\nThe Georgia Department of Labor keeps data that looks at employment and the unemployment rate in each one of the state\u2019s 159 counties. In December 2011, the most recent month available before Nash\u2019s speech, the unemployment rates were as follows in each county.\n\nClayton: 11.8\nFulton: 9.8\nDeKalb: 9.7\nCobb: 8.5\nGwinnett: 8.4\n\nWe\u2019ll note that Clayton\u2019s labor force, at 133,243, is one-third to one-quarter of the size of the other counties. The others have labor forces that range from 372, 274 in Cobb to the highest, 485,690, in Fulton.\n\nOn that point, Nash was right.\n\nAs for employment growth in Gwinnett, we had a problem with Nash\u2019s numbers. PolitiFact Georgia subtracted the number of people employed in Gwinnett in December 2010 from those in the workforce in December 2011. The increase was 2.2 percent by our count, not more than 3 percent as Nash said.\n\nSorenson said Nash\u2019s speechwriters made a mistake in the final draft of her address. They initially wrote that employment had risen by 2.3 percent, but they transposed the numbers and it read 3.2 percent. (Sorenson and his staff compared employment between June 2011 and June 2010 to come up with 2.3 percent. We used different months.) The communications staff ultimately changed it in the speech to \"more than 3 percent.\"\n\nNash\u2019s staff was unaware of the error until contacted by PolitiFact Georgia.\n\n\"It\u2019s one of those silly things that I hope doesn\u2019t reflect on a really good chair,\" Sorenson said.\n\nNash\u2019s first statement was accurate, but the second part was not because of the editing error. We rate her statement Mostly True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11491"}
