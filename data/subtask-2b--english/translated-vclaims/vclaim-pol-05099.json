Clinton addressed the issue during the April 14 debate in Brooklyn, N.Y., when she said she would only appoint a Supreme Court judge who believed that Roe v. Wade was a stable law. \"I want to say something about this, since we're talking about the Supreme Court and what's at stake. We've had eight discussions before, this is our ninth, \"Said Clinton. \"We didn't have one question about women's right to make their own decisions about reproductive health care, not one.\" The line got a big applause from the audience. But was it true? We found no direct questions about abortion in nine minutes for discussion, although sometimes the candidates raised the subject themselves. We looked for the words \"abortion,\" \"paternity planned\" and \"pro-choice\" in the debate minutes of the Washington Post: October 13, Las Vegas: \"Clanton said the Republicans \"there is no problem with having a large government to interfere with women's right to choose and try to eliminate family planning.\" November 14, De Moin: Clinton spoke of democratic candidates, and said, \"We all support family planning funding.\" December 19, New Hampshire: Clinton reported that a police officer had been killed in response to \"planned family crimes\" and said that the Republicans would abandon family planning. January 17, South Carolina: No mention. February 4, New Hampshire: Not to mention. 11 February, Milwaukee: No questions were raised regarding abortion. Saunders said he had a 100% pro-choice voting record, and Clinton endorsed it by the Family Planning Fund. March 6, Flint: No mention. 9 March Miami: Candidates were not asked about their views on abortion, but the moderator stated that the Supreme Court was considering \"the most important restrictions on abortion in a single generation.\" But the question was about the qualifications Clinton would be looking for in the Supreme Court. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 11 January, 2021, 14 April, New York: In the ninth debate, Clinton said that conservatives were trying to restrict women's rights and Donald Trump said that women should be punished for abortion.\" And they never asked about this.\" She said. \"To be full of my concern, Sun. Sanders says with respect to Trump was a distraction. I don't think it's a distraction. It concerns the heart of what we are like women, our rights, our autonomy, our ability to make our own decisions, and we need to talk about it and defend family planning from these heinous attacks.\" \"You look at the senator and former congressman who proudly has a 100 per cent pro-choice voting record, who will accept Republican governors who try to restrict women's right to choose.\" He called for expanded funding for family planning. Several news articles, including the Washington Post, MSNBC, Time, Vox, stated that during democratic discussions, the discussion managers had not asked about abortion. \"It is true that there was not a single question about abortion in any of the democratic debates,\" said James Owens, spokesman for NARAL Pro-Choice America. The organization called for democratic interlocutors to ask about abortion, including a Twitter campaign #AskAboutabortion. Before the debate in New York, NARAL sent a letter to CNN Director Wolfe Blazer urging him to ask about abortion. Ren\u00e9 Bryce Sherman, a member of the Governing Council of NAral, wrote a column on Glamour published on New York's day of discussion saying that although they supported abortion, there were questions to be asked about their positions: \"Will abortion be covered in Sanders' medical care plan for all? How will Clinton direct the Department of Justice to respond to the record number of attacks on service providers? Will their administration intervene to stop the prosecution of those who motivate themselves to abort? How will candidates prevent states from closing abortion clinics? Will their immigration policy ensure that undocumented persons have access to abortion care? How will they ensure that everyone is able to have access to safe and affordable abortion care in their community?\" However, there was a town hall, where the moderator spoke about abortion, and a spokesman for Clinton told us. In the Fox News Municipal Hall on March 7, the moderator asked Brett Bayer Sanders and Clinton questions about abortion. Pierre asked Saunders: \"Can you mention one circumstance at which stage of pregnancy you are satisfied that an abortion is illegal?\" Sanders replied: \"I happen to think it's wrong for the government to tell a woman what to do with her body.\" He then asked Clinton a similar question: \"Do you believe that a child should have any legal rights or protection before birth? Or do you think there should be no restrictions on any abortions at any stage of pregnancy?\" Clinton replied that it supported abortion rights. \"I've been registered in favour of a late pregnancy list that would have exceptions to the life and health of the mother,\" she said. Our referee (Clinton) says in nine democratic debates: \"We did not have one question about women's right to make their own decisions on reproductive health care, nor one question.\" We could not find any example of the moderator asking a direct question about abortion, but Clinton and Sanders raised the issue in multiple debates. We're assessing this claim right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05099"}
