(That turned out to be Pants on Fire-level inaccurate.)\nNow, a social media post roaming around the internet claims that a photo of the National Mall during Trump\u2019s Fourth of July \"Salute to America\" ceremony shows how few people attended, and asserts the webcam filming the celebration was purposely turned off because of it.\u00a0\nThe post, shared by the Other 98% Facebook page on July 4, features a picture of what appears to be a rainy, empty National Mall, with text below that reads:\u00a0\n\"The webcam of the National Mall was abruptly shut down without notice and has been removed from the whitehouse.gov site. Presumably to stop viewers from seeing the lack of attendees at the #TrumpParade. We are about to relive Trump\u2019s inauguration all over again.\"\nThe page also added this caption alongside the photo: \"Trump's parade was an unmitigated, absolute, outrageously expensive disaster. First of all, barely anyone showed up. The webcams on the National Mall have all been turned off without notice so no one will talk about Trump's 'crowd size'. DO NOT spread this photo around, we don't want to make our Great Leader angry.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nWe have no reason to disbelieve that the\u00a0photo used in the Facebook post\u00a0was taken during the \"Salute to America\"\u00a0event; it appears that it was first tweeted by an account called @SpinDr. However, the image captures only a small section of sidewalk that is not representative of the actual crowd during the event.\nA wide-shot photo by Getty photographer Susan Welsh shows hundreds, if not thousands, of spectators lined up with the following caption: \"US President Donald Trump speaks during the \u2018Salute to America\u2019 Fourth of July event at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, DC, July 4, 2019.\" Several images captured by Associated Press photographers also support a large number of attendees, as does a C-SPAN live stream of the event (particularly around the 29:00 minute mark).\nAlthough an official estimate of the event\u2019s crowd size has not been released, images and videos from numerous reputable sources paint a very different picture than the Facebook post\u2019s claim. While some Twitter users shared similar photos of empty sections of lawn, several news organizations and media outlets shared videos and photos of a congested event:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBREAKING: Massive crowd waiting for President Trump to speak at the #SaluteToAmerica in Washington D.C.#4thOfJuly - @BreakingNLive pic.twitter.com/xbPlTE7jvm\u2014 Breaking News Global (@BreakingNAlerts) July 4, 2019 \nThe view looking out into the crowd from the Lincoln Memorial.
