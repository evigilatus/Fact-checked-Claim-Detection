Ron Johnson said March 21, 2017 at a WisPolitics event in Washington, D.C. -- highlighting concerns over whether a top priority for Ryan and President Donald Trump can pass.\nAfterward, Johnson complained to a reporter about what he sees as a paradox:\nThe replacement, he said, would reduce subsidies that help lower-income people buy health insurance, but also \"expand the entitlement\" by giving subsidies to higher-income people \"that Obamacare never helped.\"\nLet\u2019s see if Johnson\u2019s right.\nNote: We\u2019re fact checking Johnson\u2019s claim based on the original GOP legislation, not on any changes that might have been made after his statement. The\u00a0expected House vote on March 23, 2017 was postponed a few hours after this fact check was posted.\nTax credits\nJohnson\u2019s claim alludes to what are known as refundable tax credits that help people who buy their own health insurance.\nHow they work: If a person has a federal tax bill of $2,500 and receives a $1,000 tax credit, the tax bill is reduced to $1,500. A refundable tax credit means that if the amount of the tax credit is greater than the amount of taxes owed, the taxpayer receives a refund for the difference.\nBoth Obamacare and the GOP plan, referred to by Democrats as \"Trumpcare,\" offer the credits. But, as Johnson indicated, they take different approaches.\nObamacare: Tax credits are based on a person\u2019s income and the cost of health insurance in the area where they live. The subsidies are available to people whose income is between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level (in 2017, 400 percent is about $47,000 per year for an individual). The subsidies are larger for people with lower incomes and for those who live in areas where health care costs are higher.\nGOP plan: The credits vary by age -- people in their 20s would get $2,000 a year, with credits rising to $4,000 for people in their 60s. The eligibility extends to individuals who earn up to $75,000 a year -- a significantly higher income than under Obamacare.\nSo, what\u2019s the upshot?\nThe effect on people\nAn expert nonprofit organization in health care, the Kaiser Family Foundation, summarizes the differences this way:\nUnder the GOP plan, lower-income people generally will get reduced tax credits compared to Obamacare -- especially those who are older and live in areas where health care costs more. Meanwhile, more people with higher incomes would become eligible for tax credits.\nHere are the average tax credits for a 40-year-old, according to Kaiser:\n\n\n\n\nAnnual income in 2020\n\n\nObamacare tax credits\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin LeMahieu\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a TV interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It takes quite a while on Election Day to load those ballots, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGOP plan tax credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$20,000\n\n\n$4,143\n\n\n$3,000\n\n\n\n\n$40,000*\n\n\n$1,021\n\n\n$3,000\n\n\n\n\n$75,000\n\n\n0\n\n\n$3,000\n\n\n\n\n$100,000\n\n\n0\n\n\n$500\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n(In Milwaukee, the estimate is that the credit would be $1,280 with Obamacare and $3,000 with the GOP plan.)\nOur rating\nJohnson says the GOP\u2019s Obamacare replacement would reduce subsidies that help lower-income people buy health insurance, but also \"expand the entitlement\" by giving subsidies to higher-income people \"that Obamacare never helped.\"\nThe Republican plan does offer subsidies, known as refundable tax credits, that are smaller for lower-income people than they are under Obamacare.
