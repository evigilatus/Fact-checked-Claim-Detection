The ad\u2019s narration features the words \"lied\" or \"lying\" no fewer than four times.\nIn the ad released July 17, the narrator said, \"Liberal lying Joe\u2019s got to go. Told Trump yes to tax cuts. He lied. Yes to repealing Obamacare. He lied. Now Manchin says he\u2019s pro-life but seems to only want a pro-abortion Supreme Court justice. Does Manchin back abortion on demand up to the day of birth? Liberal lying Joe\u2019s got to go.\"\nWATCH: @JoeManchinWV lied to the people of West Virginia and to @POTUS about how he would vote on issues that matter most to West Virginians. It\u2019s time for liberal lying Joe to go. #wvpol #WNSen pic.twitter.com/kBMDzhk0QU\u2014 The Senate Majority (@NRSC) July 17, 2018\n\n\nThe narration includes a lot of claims, but in this article we\u2019ll fact check one of them \u2014 that Manchin was \"yes to repealing Obamacare.\"\nAt best, the ad oversimplifies Manchin\u2019s record on Obamacare, officially known as the Affordable Care Act. The law, signed by President Barack Obama, overhauled the nation\u2019s health care insurance markets and provided other consumer protections.\nManchin has been open about not liking certain parts of the law, and has said that he\u2019d like to repeal those portions. But we were unable to find an example in which he supported a repeal of the entire law.\nManchin\u2019s comments from 2010\nHere are some of the instances of Manchin\u2019s comments in 2010, when he was the state\u2019s governor running in a tight special election for Senate. His Republican challenger, businessman John Raese, was accusing him of being a rubber stamp for Obama.\n\u2022 On Sept. 18, 2010, the Gazette-Mail reported, \"The governor recently told the Gazette-Mail that he backed only certain provisions (of the Affordable Care Act) \u2014 for instance, those that allow people with pre-existing conditions to get health care, or let young adults stay on their parents' health plans. \u2018I wouldn't have voted for the final version of that thing with the way that it came out,\u2019\" he said.\n\u2022 On Sept. 27, 2010, Real Clear Politics wrote that Manchin, previously a strong supporter of the law, now \"favored \u2018repealing the things that are bad in that bill.\u2019 He ticked off a list of reforms in the law that he supports and asserted there is broad agreement in both parties for many of them. \u2018Can't you keep that as a good base?\u2019 he said, adding, \u2018It's a great bill.\u2019 He emphasized that he's not calling for wholesale repeal and just wants to roll back parts of it\u2026 .\"\n\u2022 On Oct. 8, 2010, MSNBC\u2019s Hardball host Chris Matthews asked Manchin, \"Do you like the health care bill that Obama got through? Do you like it?\" Manchin responded, \"No, not the way it passed.\"\n\u2022 On Oct. 11, 2010, Manchin said on Fox And Friends that he\u2019s \"always been in favor of health reform\" but the law was \"far too reaching \u2026 . It needs to have a lot of it repealed.\"\n\u2022 On Oct. 24, 2010, Manchin was pressed on his stance by host Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday. Wallace asked, \"You're saying now that if you'd known what was really in the bill, although last March you said you'd have voted for it, you now say you would have voted against it?\"\u00a0Manchin responded, \"Correct. Now, knowing the existence as far as how reaching it had been, as far as an onerous, I would have.\" He added, however, \"There's a lot of good parts to it. Why won't we fix what's wrong with it and make it better?\"\n\u2022 Perhaps most notably, on Oct. 12, 2010, the Charleston Daily Mail quoted remarks by Manchin that had been reported previously in the Wheeling Intelligencer: \"They can absolutely be sure I will vote to repeal the whole thing unless we can find common ground and common sense.\" That's the closest example we could find of an affirmative vote to repeal, but we couldn't find it corroborated. The Daily Mail article added, \"The Daily Mail has made repeated unsuccessful efforts to talk directly to Manchin about his position on health care over the past couple of weeks.\"\nIt\u2019s clear that Manchin, facing a tough election, was walking a tightrope on the Affordable Care Act in 2010. Presented with the hypothetical question of whether he would have voted for the bill if he\u2019d been in Congress at the time, Manchin said \u2014 some of the time \u2014 that he would not have.\nBut that\u2019s not the same as saying \"yes to repealing Obamacare,\" as the ad asserts. In fact, his message in these comments was that he had some problems with the law, but he wanted to repeal the problematic portions, not the whole bill.\nManchin\u2019s 2014 comment\nMorrisey\u2019s campaign also pointed us to an article in the Register-Herald of Beckley, W.Va., on Feb 20, 2014. It\u2019s about a local town hall appearance by Manchin. Here\u2019s the relevant portion:\nBoth parties agree on many aspects of the ACA, such as pre-existing conditions not being excluded from coverage and no lifetime caps, but there are still many kinks that need to be fixed, Manchin said.\n\"I will vote tomorrow to repeal (the ACA), but I want to fix the problems in it.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said the ACA is essentially a product and the government needs to find a way to \"sell it\" and make their customers want to buy it.\nThe phrasing of the quote is odd, because there was no Obamacare repeal vote held the next day or the succeeding few days, according to Senate records.\nIndeed, Manchin\u2019s camp quickly sought to clarify the comments at the time.\nAfter the Hill, a Capitol Hill newspaper, reported the contents of the Register-Herald\u2019s article, Manchin\u2019s office provided a rebuttal that was added to the article:\nIn an email to The Hill, Manchin said that despite his comments, he does not support repealing the law.\n\"I have never supported repealing the Affordable Care Act because I came to Washington to find solutions to our country\u2019s problems,\" he said. ...\nStill, Manchin said the law has \"many flaws,\" and that those parts that can\u2019t be fixed and should be eliminated.\n\"We should be working together to identify which parts of the law are broken and need to be fixed,\" he continued. \"We may learn that some parts of the law can\u2019t be repaired, and we should eliminate those parts entirely. \u2026\"\nIt\u2019s incomplete to cite Manchin\u2019s words as reported in the local newspaper, since Manchin immediately sought to clarify what was reported.\nManchin\u2019s votes on repeal bills\nSince his election to the Senate, Manchin has voted consistently against repealing the Affordable Care Act wholesale.\nIn eight Senate repeal votes tracked by healthreformvotes.org, a website affiliated with the liberal-leaning group healthinsurance.org, Manchin spurned GOP-led repeal efforts and voted for the \"pro-consumer\" side on all eight occasions. Those eight votes included one in 2011, two in 2015, and five in 2017.\nManchin\u2019s more recent comments on the Affordable Care Act\nRecently, Manchin\u2019s message on the Affordable Care Act has been consistent: He strongly approves of many things in the bill, and wants to fix the bill\u2019s shortcomings rather than repealing it wholesale. Here\u2019s a sampling of comments since early 2017, when President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans sought to repeal the law:\n\u2022 In March 2017, he told reporters on Capitol Hill that in West Virginia, \"I got an older population, I got a poorer population, and I got an opiate issue we need to clean up. And now, talk about insult to injury. You\u2019ve got to have a moral compass inside of you.\"\n\u2022 Manchin said in May 2017 that \"if they can get rid of the word 'repeal,' Democrats can sit down,\" according to the Washington Examiner.\n\u2022 In July 2017, Manchin told WTOV-TV in Steubenville, Ohio, \"I'm not voting to repeal any of the votes (Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.) wants on repealing (Obamacare). I don't think you can throw the baby out with the bathwater thinking that you're going to save the baby when the baby might've needed a diaper change.\"\n\u2022 He also told the Intelligencer and the News-Register in Wheeling, W.Va., \"I don\u2019t think we should be repealing,\" Manchin said, adding, \"Come on guys, let\u2019s sit down and fix it.\"\nOur ruling\nMorrisey\u2019s ad said that Manchin said\u00a0\"yes to repealing Obamacare. He lied.\"\nDuring his tough initial Senate race in 2010, Manchin did rhetorically put some distance between himself and the law, which was passed before he was a senator. However, to the extent that he supported repeals, he was talking about repealing portions of the law he saw as problematic \u2014 not the whole law, much of which he said he supported.\nIndeed, Manchin has consistently voted against and criticized wholesale repeal efforts, saying that he favored reforming portions of the law instead.\nThe statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.\n Share the Facts 2018-07-24 19:25:38 UTC   PolitiFact    3 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly False  Says Joe Manchin said \"yes to repealing Obamacare.
