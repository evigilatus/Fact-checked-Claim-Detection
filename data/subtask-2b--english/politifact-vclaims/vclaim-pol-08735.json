Its president, Evan Feinberg, warned in an Oct. 1 commentary in The Providence Journal that people who sign up will become part of the Federal Data Services Hub, \"an enormous database of every participant\u2019s private medical records, tax and financial info, legal history, and other intimate information.\"\n\"Local law enforcement, insurance companies, and innumerable federal agencies and low-level bureaucrats will have access to the Data Hub\u2019s treasure trove of personal info,\" he said.\nIt's not surprising that some of these people would have access to the data. After all, low-level bureaucrats are processing the application and you are, after all, buying insurance from an insurance company. But the part about local law enforcement caught our eye.\nWould signing up for Obamacare really give our local police the ability to know how much money we make, the terms of our divorce and when our Viagra prescription is due for refill?\nPolitiFact National examined an element of the question last May when Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., received a Pants On Fire for saying the IRS is going to be \"in charge\" of \"a huge national database\" on health care that will include Americans\u2019 \"personal, intimate, most close-to-the-vest secrets.\" PolitiFact found that the IRS isn't in charge and it's not a health care database.\nThe hub pulls limited data from other agencies to verify eligibility and determine how much an individual will actually pay for an insurance plan on the exchanges. For example, the Social Security Administration is asked to verify a person's Social Security number. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is asked to verify immigration status. The IRS confirms financial data to see if a person is eligible for a subsidy.\nIt's the same system that allows Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program \"to query the government databases used today in the eligibility processes for many state and federal programs,\" said Brian Cook, a spokesman for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.\nWhat kind of data does it collect? Rhode Island's marketplace, HealthSource RI, sent us a copy of the application form.\nIt asks for a lot of financial information that, one would think, the data hub should be able to simply get from the IRS, such as how much money applicants have earned from investments, a pension or Social Security, or how much they are paying in alimony or student loans. (A shorter application is available for people who are not seeking a tax break to pay for their coverage.)\nThe system doesn't ask for -- and the database doesn't collect -- a person's medical records. The only medical information sought is whether an applicant is blind, disabled and, if pregnant, the due date.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe only legal history information is a question about whether applicants are in jail and, if so, when they expect to be released.\nSo the \"treasure trove\" of information isn't as rich as Feinberg asserts. (The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services even insists that it's not a database, but we'll leave that for another fact check.)\nBut the key question is whether local law enforcement would have access to the information.\nWhen we contacted Feinberg's office to ask for the source of that claim, spokesman David Pasch sent us to a section of the Federal Register that gives the government the right to release information to \"any state or local governmental agency ... that has the authority to investigate potential fraud, waste or abuse\" so such cases can be prosecuted.\nThe federal rules do not give local law enforcement unfettered access to the database.\nWhen we raised the issue with Pasch, he acknowledged that the regulations didn't say that local police would have free access to the database and argued that Feinberg \"did not say all contractors could look at whatever they want, whenever they want.\"\nWe disagree. Saying that law enforcement will have access to a \"treasure trove\" of personal information suggests that police would have broad access to that information, not just basic facts that the government would give to law enforcement to conduct a fraud investigation.\nPatti Unruh, a spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said, \"Local law enforcement would only receive access to personally identifiable information after submitting a specific request for such information to CMS and after CMS rigorously evaluated the request for information to ensure that it is legally permissible and is reasonably necessary to investigate, prosecute or combat fraud, waste or abuse.\"\nOur ruling\nEvan Feinberg of Generation Opportunity said, \u00a0\"Local law enforcement ... will have access to the Data Hub\u2019s treasure trove of personal info\" in a database with \"private medical records, tax and financial info, legal history, and other intimate information.\"\nNot only is he making a huge stretch when he says the treasure trove includes private medical records and legal history -- with financial data, not so much -- he is stretching further to suggest that local police will have anything close to routine access to the data in the Hub.\nThus, the contention that signing up for Obamacare will allow a prying police chief to view your latest mammogram is False.\n(If you have a claim you\u2019d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, e-mail us at [email\u00a0protected] And follow us on Twitter: @politifactri.)", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08735"}
