The new research says that drinking wine is more important than exercise to live in the 90-year-old,\" as Jean 21 said of the main titles of a publication on Overtherespectives.com. Destructive: Drink moderately; do not cancel the gym membership. The Opperspectives.com was highlighted as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misleading information in NewsFelle. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The story does not support the claim in the headline - nor does it mention anywhere that drinking wine is more important than exercising sport for a long life. It even contains lines on the importance of action. \"We strongly advise you to get one or two of your favorite wines during the day, but make sure you also go run or walk first,\" said the article. The story of \"Upper Horizons.com\" refers to a study on ageing and dementia, which focused on people aged 90 and over. The study began in 2003 and is known as Study + 90, led by researchers at the University of California-Irvine. On 20 January 2021, The Gateway Pundit reported in an article entitled \"The World Health Organization (WHO) acknowledges its blatantly exaggerated tests of individuals for whom positive tests have been conducted for COVID.\" By Noah Y. Kim: 22 January 2021, some of the findings of the 90+ study found that people who drink moderate amounts of alcohol or coffee lived longer than those who did not, and that people who have overweight in the 1970s lived longer than ordinary or underweight people. Dr. Claudia Kawas, one of the 90 study investigators, Polyte Fact, reported that they had published a paper on alcohol and longevity in 2007 and had not done any work in the region since then. It should not be inferred from their studies that alcohol was more important than exercise. At a conference of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in February 2018, Kawas also said that there was a link between practice and longevity. \"Practice, less than 15 minutes a day was associated with a longer age,\" said Kawas. \"30 minutes was better, 45 minutes was even better. With the mercy of couch potatoes like me, three hours (or more) were no better than 45 minutes.\" Do not say that people should be given priority in drinking over work. \"Keep in mind that I start studying people when they're 90 years old,\" Quas said at the Conference. \"I think it is very likely that individuals who drink too much at a younger age do not even reach their 1990s.\" The \"On Us\" page on \"Upper Horizon\" com said, \"All our website contains is an opinion formed by an informed group - but it's still just an opinion - not a fact or news about who, what, when, etc.\" In this case, the headline of the story is wrong. We assess it wrong.
