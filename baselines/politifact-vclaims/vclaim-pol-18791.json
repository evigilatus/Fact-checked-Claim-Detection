It\u2019s rated a tossup by the Cook Political Report.\nWe rated Half True a super PAC\u2019s claim that Kulkarni attended \"notorious desert drug parties\" and was arrested for cocaine. The party reference was to Burning Man, the Nevada arts and spirituality festival; and his drug arrest was when he was 18.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Nehls said\nKulkarni\u2019s campaign cited comments Nehls made in a post on his campaign Facebook page on April 22, the day that Judge Linda Hidalgo, the top official in neighboring Harris County, issued an order that residents age 10 and over wear a face covering when outside the home, or face a fine of up to $1,000.\u00a0\nNehls wrote, in part:\u00a0\n\"I encourage people to wear a mask if they have one, I encourage people to wash their hands frequently, I encourage people to do the right thing to help protect our most vulnerable, but this government MANDATE from Harris County is unnecessary, unconstitutional, and unAmerican. It\u2019s an unprecedented overreach which looks more like a communist dictatorship than a free Republic.\"\nThe broader context of Nehls\u2019 comment makes clear that he was not referring to the wearing of masks, or to the people who wear them, as Kulkarni\u2019s ad suggests. Nehls was describing the Harris County order as un-American.\nOur ruling\nKulkarni claimed that Nehls \"called wearing masks 'un-American' and called those who do 'communists.'\"\nNehls called Harris County\u2019s mask mandate un-American and compared it to a communist dictatorship. He was not talking about masks or people who wear them.\nWe rate the statement False.\n\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections FactChat #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click here for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18791"}
