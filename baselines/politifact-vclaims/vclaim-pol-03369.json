Facebook users, federal judges and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg were all prepared to fight any executive order, but Trump didn\u2019t care.\n\"Inside, we both know what\u2019s been going on. We know the game and we\u2019re gonna play it,\" Trump is quoted in the story.\nFirst and foremost, we know that this is a faker than fake quote, because it\u2019s a line from Rick Astley\u2019s Never Gonna Give You Up. Internet-savvy users should realize instantly they\u2019re being Rick Rolled here. That\u2019s apparently still a thing for some people.\nBut we just gotta tell you how we\u2019re feeling, and gotta make you understand.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven with Trump\u2019s penchant for labeling things as fake news, there has been no report about an executive order banning Facebook. We tried to reach usanews4u.us through their Contact Us form, but didn\u2019t receive a reply. The site is registered to an address in Veles, Macedonia, a hotbed of fake news websites.\nAnd while the post was dated April 2, the tags on the story clued readers in that it is actually for April Fool\u2019s Day.\nIt appears it was a news outlet\u2019s attempt at a joke that was repurposed without clear attribution.\nThe story originated on April 1 at Firstpost.com, a website filled largely with what look to be legitimate, India-centric news stories. There also is a \"Faking News\" section full of intentionally bogus content \"to attract your attention.\"\nBut this post wasn\u2019t categorized there, instead getting the label \"World News.\" The post also had an April Fool\u2019s Day tag, so the story is a prank.\nReaders who made it to the end of the faux story would have noticed something not in the usanews4u.us post: A link marked as Trump\u2019s and Zuckerberg\u2019s remarks on the issue actually redirects to \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 Astley\u2019s 1987 hit single.\nIf you ask us how we\u2019re feeling about this statement, don't tell us you're too blind to see.
