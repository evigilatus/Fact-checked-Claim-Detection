Some of them flee gangs in Central America and intend to seek asylum in the United States. Others say that they migrate because of poverty in their home countries. (Here's what we know about the convoy, and here's a bunch of misleading information about it.) The White House did not provide a recorded response to Trump &apos; s claim. Democrats have said that migrants should be allowed the legal right to seek asylum, but that is not the same as calling convoys to come to the United States. Nor did they say that they wanted to \"sign it\" to obtain benefits or vote illegally, or bypass existing laws. No democratic call for democratic convoys was largely silenced from the convoy, but instead focused on Republicans and health care as the 6th election day of November approached. Some Democrats have said that immigrants seeking asylum should be allowed to go through that legal process, but that is not necessarily an invitation. In an interview by CNN on 23 October, Tom Peres, President of the National Democratic Commission, was asked to address the Democratic Party's message about the convoy and whether he would allow them \"to enter and apply for refugee status.\" \"We are a nation of laws, and laws on books deal with refugee status and asylum issues, and these are the laws that always apply,\" said Perez. \"It is a humanitarian issue of importance, and our laws require that people be treated with dignity and given this process.\" A similar statement was made by Mr. Kamala Harris, Deputy Prime Minister. \"Our strength has always been that we are a tolerant nation, that we particularly welcome those who have fled from harm,\" said Harris October 22 in Iowa, according to CNN. \"The idea that we distort the reputation of any one group, and the fear of terror - this is not in the interest of our country.\" Democratic House of Representatives leader Nancy Belusi and Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schommer in a joint statement on 20 October said that Trump was \"institutionalized to change the subject from health care to immigration because he knows that health care is the first issue that Americans are interested in,\" adding that Republicans \"do a mess in our health-care system.\" This message was reiterated in another statement: \"Despite the fear of the Republicans, this group of families may not even reach the borders of the United States, and those who migrate for economic reasons will not be eligible for asylum.\" The members of the Karavan are also not illegal foreigners, as Stephen Legumsky, an honorary professor at the Law School of the University of Washington, St. Louis, who served as a major adviser in the United States. Citizenship and immigration services during the Obama administration. On January 18, 2021, in an interview with the right national radio program, \"China was behind intervention and effort to overthrow our government and elections, electoral fraud.\" By Daniel Funk: January 19, 2021, \"of course the United States is not obliged to grant asylum to anyone applying,\" Legumsky said, \"But upon reaching the border they have a legal right, expressly granted by Congress, to apply for it.\" The Democrats do not say they want to register the members of the convoy for privileges upon arrival, let alone the right to vote without being American citizens. Polyte Fact has repeatedly dismantled Trump &apos; s allegations of collective voter fraud. Even if some convoy members were granted asylum and became citizens, it would take several years before they could vote for federal posts. (A few jurisdictions allow non-citizens to vote in local races.) \"The only members of the convoy who may become eligible to vote one day are those who are found to meet all the legal requirements of asylum, and subsequently obtain green cards, and eventually become naturalized citizens,\" said Ligumski. A person must hold a green card for at least five years and meet certain other conditions before applying for American citizenship. If migrants are granted asylum, they are eligible for medical and other forms of government assistance, as Legumsky said. The Federal Act prohibits illegal immigrants in the country from benefiting from most public assistance programmes. However, they can receive free school lunches, supplementary feeding programme for women, infants and children, and emergency medical care. Stephen Kamaruta, Director of Research at the Centre for Migration Studies, a think tank that prefers low levels of migration, said. \"But it is not a moral flaw on their part, but it reflects the very low levels of education of this population and the resulting decline in income and the need for services.\" The 1982 United States Supreme Court case also stated that migrants, regardless of their immigration status, were allowed free primary and secondary education. \"But migrant children cannot obtain this right if they are detained pending asylum hearings, except in a few family detention centres,\" said Stephen W. Yale-Luhr, a professor of immigration law at Cornell Law School. If the members of the convoy entered the United States and received emergency medical care, went to public school, and received free lunch at school, it would not necessarily be because the Democrats \"signed it,\" because the law allows it. If they eventually acquire American citizenship, they will be allowed to vote. Our Governor Trump said, \"Democracy wants to invite a convoy after the illegal alien convoy to our country. They wish to register for free health care, free care, free education and the right to vote.\" One senior Democrat said that migrants should be allowed to enter the asylum process available under the law. But it's hard for Trump to say that this is a convoy call to come to the United States. Immigrants receiving asylum are eligible for medical and other forms of government assistance. Illegal immigrants in the country have access to emergency medical care and limited access to programmes, such as free school food and free public education. This will not be because Democrats \"want to register them,\" but because the law allows it. The Tramp allegation also falsely involves the Democrats &apos; desire to urge members of the convoy to vote in the mid-term elections. The Tramp claim is inaccurate and distorts the facts. We assess it wrong. Sharing the facts of 2018-11-01 19:14:28 UTC PoliticsFact 2 1 7 PoliticFact Dacting: Wrong \"Democracy wants to invite a convoy after the illegal alien convoy to our country.
