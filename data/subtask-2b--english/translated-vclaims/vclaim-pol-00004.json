The online left-wing announcement, falsely, Sin Lindsay Graham, R-S.C., demonstrated support for climate change policy known as the new green deal. The new green agreement largely calls for the entire country to mobilize and bring the United States to zero net emissions by 2050, the point where it does not add more carbon to the atmosphere than is captured. The government's work will be huge. Graham, a strong governor, stood against the idea. But in the ad, he says, \"We believe in the new green deal.\" The man behind the announcement, Adril Hampton, communications strategy in San Francisco, said that he got the idea from a home hearing when Alexandria's President Okasio Cortez, D-N.Y., pressed Facebook Executive Director Mark Zuckerberg. \"Can I run announcements targeting Republicans in the pre-elections saying they voted for the new green deal?\" Okasio Cortez asked. Zuckerberg said, \"Possibly.\" Here's what the viewers see and hear, and then give what Graham actually said. The main title of the Declaration is \"Provinces for a New Green Deal,\" which is displayed in an angle throughout the Declaration, which takes a minute and a half. Starts with a video of Republican President Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon talking about the need to protect the environment. Nixon oversaw the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency and major amendments to the Clean Air and Water Acts, two pillars of American environmental legislation. The announcement then goes to a press conference with Graham on the podium. Graham says: \"I am Sin Graham from South Carolina.\" \"I'm here to announce with my colleagues that we care about conservation.\" Graham's voice continues to fill the screen with pictures of wind turbines and pine twigs that gently swing in the breeze. On January 18, 2021, in an interview with the right national radio program, \"China was behind intervention and effort to overthrow our government and elections, electoral fraud.\" By Daniel Fanky: January 19, 2021 \"We Care About the Environment,\" Graham follows. \"From the point of view of the Republicans, I think we need to look at science and recognize that climate change is real. Simply put, we believe in the new green deal.\" In order to measure well, the Declaration presents a picture with Graham and Alexandria Okasio-Cortez, the main author of the New Green Compact, shoulder to shoulder in a gathering, and arms raised in victory. The image of Graham and Okacio Cortez is a fake, as in his declared support for the new green deal, the original picture of the Democratic Presidency candidate Bernie Sanders and Okacio Cortez, taken in 2018. The head of Graham replaced the head of Sanders. The audio editing of the Graham news conference was blocked by cutting off the video of the event to add new images. These are key excerpts from Graham's event. \"From the point of view of the Republicans I think we need to show that we care about conservation -- we care about the environment,\" said Graham. And then he said, \"We have innovative solutions that aren't top-down organizational solutions,\" and he said: \"We believe that you can't have a healthy environment and destroy the economy and we believe that our friends on the other side are interested in the environment, Graham said, \"When nine out of ten scientists say that accepting CO2 creates the effect of greenhouse gases, He said, \"Look at science, admit that climate change is real,\" but here's what he said about the new green deal. \"No single Republican will vote for anything that comes out of the new green deal because it's crazy.\" Our governor's announcement from the left-wing online group says Graham supports the new green deal. His words had been written to change their meaning, and a false image had been added. We're assessing the claim of this Pants ad on fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00004"}
