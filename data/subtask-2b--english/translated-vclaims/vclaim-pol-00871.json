Jay Ensley, who made climate change central to his democratic presidency in 2020, said that he would use the enormous purchasing power of the United States army to promote clean energy. In an interview with the Insley Administration, when he asked what it would do about global warming in the first 100 days, Ensley said that it would make the Pentagon budget more environmentally friendly, arguing that elements of that concept had proved to be working. \"We flew a Boeing 737 across the Atlantic on biofuels. We flew an F-18. I told Ensley Fox. \"so that we can use the purchasing power of the U.S. military to drive some of this clean energy.\" Insley was right about the biofuels that operated an ultrasound plane. We also found that the aircraft were similar to the 737 transatlantic flights on mixed fuel, although there were no cases in which 737 aircraft did so. The F-18 'Green Hornet' Anjali is right that the U.S. Army has flown F-18 on biofuels. Marine pilots made history in 2010 by flying F-18 Super Hornet on a 50-50 mixture of conventional jet fuel and biofuels - the first time this was attempted in an ultrasound aircraft, according to the Washington Lab. The 45-minute pilot trip on Earth Day took place at a naval base in Maryland, as mentioned by the Navy Information Wing. Biofuels have been derived from a plant called Kamlina, which is home to North America. Before the pilot trip, the Navy, the Pentagon, said, awarded a contract of $2.7 million to a Montana-based renewable fuel company for 40,000 gallons of comina-based fuel. Green movements were part of the initiative of then Navy Minister Ray Mapus - known as the Great Green Fleet - a three-year programme of $510 million to explore cleaner energy options. Within the framework of this programme, the Navy has issued certificates to ships of war and aircraft engaged in biofuels. However, according to Todd Harrison, Director of Defense Budget Analysis at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, marine systems do not routinely use biofuels because of their high cost. Harrison seemed skeptical that the army would accept a radical transformation of the alternative power source. On January 13, 2021, in a story, General David Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for the use of marines for inaugural security, saying, \"We are not working for you.\" On January 17, 2021, \"It is possible that if the Navy starts large-scale and regular purchases of biofuels for its systems that can help start this industry and lower the price of other consumers,\" added Harrison. But this is going to be a big investment by the Navy for something that benefits the army only marginally. For his part, Mapus told us that climate change and national security are inextricably linked. The role of the Ministry of Defence in combating climate change as one of the largest energy consumers on the planet should not be overlooked. To sum up: Ensley is right that the F-18s have flown on biofuels. But what about his claim about 737? 'Green' 737s? Insley did not identify who claimed to have flown the Boeing 737 across the Atlantic - a Navy spokesman said that the service branch had never flown this series of aircraft on biofuels. We contacted the Insley campaign and referred to a press release by Boeing describing the company's development of fuel mixing oil fuels and \"bio-derived oils and animal fat waste.\" The press release also mentions Boeing working with Virgin Atlantic on a pilot trip in 2008 with biofuels. However, there is nothing to mention about the 737 transatlantic aviation on biofuels. (We arrived directly at Boeing but did not hear a reply.) However, we have found numerous examples of biofuelled transatlantic flights. In 2011, Boeing published a video on YouTube for 747-8 cargo ships that completed what the aircraft manufacturer described as \"the first transatlantic biofuel flight with a commercial jet.\" Lufthansa 747 carried out its first biofuel transatlantic commercial flight to the United States in 2012, two years later Venier used oil-based biofuels to cook for a flight by Airbus A330 from Helsinki to New York. In 2018, U.S.A. celebrated the \"Longest Transatlantic Biofuel Flight to date\" when Dremliner 787 flew from San Francisco to Zurich. Insley said our governor, \"We've transported a Boeing 737 across the Atlantic Ocean on biofuels. We flew F-18s.\" The Navy made history in 2010 when an ultrasound jet flew F-18 on biofuels. We found several transatlantic flights operated by biofuels, too. We have not been able to find cases where Boeing 737, but similar to other aircraft we have documented. We're assessing this mostly right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00871"}
