Also in September 2014, Standard and Poor\u2019s upgraded the city's occupational license revenue bonds from AA to AA+.\nIn July 2014, Fitch Ratings raised its rating on Tampa's water and sewer bonds from \"AA+\"' to \"AAA,\" its highest rating.\nIn November 2014, Moody's Investors Service upgraded its rating on $101.1 million in solid waste bonds from A3 to A2. (Its highest rating is Aaa.)\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDick Greco\n\n\nstated on May 1, 2002 in city report reprinted as 2011 mayoral campaign material\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Financed the largest parking expansion program without a rate increase.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Richard Danielson \u2022 February 12, 2011\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHigher ratings let the city hold down costs by borrowing money at lower interest rates. City officials say they also validate difficult choices they've had to make in balancing the budget during the recession and its aftermath.\nBut the city has hundreds of millions of dollars in other bonds, including utilities tax bonds, sales tax bonds and special purpose bonds, that do not have the highest ratings assigned by those credit rating agencies. All of them are rated \"investment grade,\" which is better than being rated speculative grade. But for different bond issues, at least some -- and sometimes all -- of the ratings from the three rating agencies are a notch or more below the top.\nIn addition, Standard & Poors is the only agency to give its top grade so far to Tampa\u2019s general credit rating. Moody\u2019s rates it Aa1, just below Aaa. Fitch rates it AA, just below its top rating of AAA.\nBuckhorn said it wouldn\u2019t have been possible to summarize all of the city\u2019s bond ratings in a 60-second commercial, but he checked with his chief financial officer to make sure he made the most accurate statement possible. And he acknowledged that Tampa could earn even higher credit ratings on some of its debt.\n\"We strive for that,\" he said. \"So is all of our debt Triple-A? No. I would venture to say there\u2019s probably not a city in America where all of the debt is Triple-A. Is a big portion of our debt Triple-A? You betcha. ... I\u2019m proud and I\u2019ll say it wherever I go. The folks who vote for me should be pretty happy with that.\"\nBuckhorn\u2019s campaign ad said he had \"secured the highest possible bond rating.\" Loking at the campaign\u2019s use of the phrase \"highest possible,\" we find there\u2019s still room for improvement in the ratings on some of the city\u2019s debt.
