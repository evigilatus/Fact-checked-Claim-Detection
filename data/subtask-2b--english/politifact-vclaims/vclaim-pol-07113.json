It was taken as part of a lawsuit following the bankruptcy of Pillowtex, a North Carolina firm that failed shortly after Perdue\u2019s brief stint as its CEO.\nA claim during the GOP runoff election that Perdue was to blame for the firm\u2019s collapse earned a Mostly False ruling this summer, largely given the company\u2019s financial woes that predated his tenure.\nPerdue, however, did tell PolitiFact Georgia that before the extent of Pillowtex\u2019s money troubles was revealed, his turnaround plan for the company was a mix of outsourcing and marketing. It called for lower-end products to be made in Asia, while brand-name items would be American-made.\nPerdue said the same thing in the deposition.\nBut those statements, and the company\u2019s business records, reveal outsourcing plans at Pillowtex were not an effort to eliminate American jobs, said Rob Bliss, a professor of finance at Wake Forest University.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoy Barnes\n\n\nstated on May 21, 2010 in a campaign commercial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Roy Barnes was governor, \"Georgia created 235,000 jobs.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Willoughby Mariano \u2022 June 4, 2010\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plan \u2013 which was never implemented \u2013 was instead designed to save at least some domestic jobs in an industry that had largely moved overseas, Bliss said.\n\"There is nothing to suggest he was narrowly moving jobs overseas just to increase profits or give himself a bonus,\" Bliss said. \"Moving jobs overseas would have been an effort to make the company more competitive. It\u2019s a perfectly legitimate thing to do.\"\nIn Pillowtex\u2019s case, there was only a failed plan to move jobs. PolitiFact Georgia did find evidence that American jobs were lost in other firms Perdue helped manage or lead.\nSara Lee eliminated between 8,000 and 9,000 jobs worldwide \u2013 mostly in the United States and Europe \u2013 in a 1994 restructuring.\nAt the time, Perdue was the senior vice president for the company\u2019s operations in Asia. He confirms in the deposition that he successfully increased manufacturing and contracts in the region as part of that job.\nAt the same time, the company was closing four plants in Georgia, eliminating at least 540 jobs. Nunn\u2019s earlier claim using those facts was ruled True.\nThe deposition also refers to Perdue\u2019s time as a senior VP with the Haggar Clothing Co. between 1996 and 1998.\nPerdue does not mention details of his time there, though PolitiFact research showed 1,950 American jobs were lost at Haggar during that period. \u00a0\nBusiness records show the firm also shed 65 foreign jobs in those two years, indicating an overall business decline in addition to any move to foreign production.\n\"He was part of a bad scene in American industry,\" said Kerwin Swint, the chairman of the political science department at Kennesaw State University. \"But trying to say he doesn\u2019t care about American workers, that\u2019s a leap.\"\nTaken together, Perdue\u2019s own words in the legal interrogation only reveal what was already known about his business career. He managed and led companies in industries where jobs were being lost to both cheaper foreign production \u2013 outsourcing \u2013 and also to technology and global business trends far outside his scope of control.\nMoreover, the deposition was taken two years before Perdue, as CEO of Dollar General, persuaded the discount chain to sell to a private equity firm. At the time, he had grown the chain from 5,900 to 8,500 stores, adding about 19,000 part-time and full-time jobs.\n\"Politically, it\u2019s a good strategy to focus on the outsourcing, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s accurate and fair,\" Swint said. \"There is more to it.\"\nWe agree. It is accurate to claim Perdue\u2019s sworn statement is that he spent most of his business career outsourcing.\nBut that doesn\u2019t translate into callous indifference to American workers \u2013 or even a tenure that did nothing more than ship jobs abroad.\nWe continue to rate the claim Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07113"}
