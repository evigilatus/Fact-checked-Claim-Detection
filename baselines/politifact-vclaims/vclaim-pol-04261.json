I think they've been treating it as almost a probing, how far will we go? How much will we do? And that's why I was so shocked when Donald publicly invited Putin to hack into Americans. That is just unacceptable.\"\nWe will fact-check whether Clinton is right about what Trump said about Putin and the emails.\nTrump\u2019s comments about Russia hacking Clinton\u2019s emails\nA Clinton campaign spokesman pointed us to Trump\u2019s comments at a press conference at Trump National Doral golf course July 27.\n\"Russia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,\" Trump said to a room full of TV cameras as well as reporters from the Miami Herald/Tampa Bay Times. \"I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.\"\nHe also said: \"By the way, they hacked -- they probably have her 33,000 e-mails. I hope they do. They probably have her 33,000 e-mails that she lost and deleted because you'd see some beauties there.
