This is a difficult issue. It is a source of controversy. \"But I want to emphasize that we do not do this randomly. We are focusing our limited resources and people on the perpetrators of violent crimes and those convicted of crimes - not just families, not just those who aspire to raise income together. As a result, we increased the removal of criminals by 70 per cent.\" Obama's claim that under his administration, the deportation of criminals increased by 70 per cent indicates a major shift in politics, so we decided to check it out. According to data provided by the Ministry of Internal Security, the number of illegal immigrants \"deported\" increased by about 6 per cent - from 369,221 to 392,862 - between the end of September 2008 (four months before Obama took office) and the end of September 2010. However, a much larger proportion of those deported were convicted criminals. In 2008, 31 per cent of offenders were offenders; however, by 2010, the proportion had risen to 50 per cent. The initial number of convicted criminals deported increased from 114,415 in 2008 to 195,772 in 2010. That's 71 percent. So this wins with Obama's claim. Data for the first half of fiscal year 2011 (which began at the end of September) indicate that this trend continues, with approximately 52 per cent of deportations involving convicted criminals. In a press release issued on 6 October 2010, Internal Security Minister Janet Napolitano stated that the figures reflected \"the identification and removal of foreign criminals who pose a threat to public safety as a matter of priority.\" \"Our approach has produced historic results, the removal of more convicted foreign criminals than ever before and the imposition of more financial sanctions on employers who knowingly violate immigration laws and more frequently than in the entire former administration,\" Napolitano said. Roy Beck, Executive Director of the United States of America, a group that prefers to reduce immigration to the United States, said it was true that the rate of deportation, particularly of convicted criminals, was higher during the Obama era. \"Sensely, Obama is to be commended, for all his complaints, that he may have done a little better than Bush in deportations,\" said Beck. \"I believe, however, that the main context is that the amount of deportation in the Bush era was rather small.\" Even under Obama, Beck said, the administration is talking about less than 400,000 deportations in a country with an estimated 11 million illegal immigrants. :: Demographic and health survey statistics show that under Bush, the total number of deportations tripled between 2001 and 2008 - from 116,782 to 369,221. However, in the latter part of the Bush presidency, it was the biggest leap in the deportation of illegal immigrants who were not convicted criminals. During the eight years of the Bush presidency, the deportation of convicted criminals increased from 71,079 in 2001 to 114,415 in 2008. This is a 61% increase over eight years. In the first two years under Obama, data indicate a shift in policy towards giving priority to the deportation of convicted offenders. Obama is right that there is a 70 percent increase. We're assessing his statement right.
