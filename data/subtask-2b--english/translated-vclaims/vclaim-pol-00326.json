The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 January 11, 2012, it goes without saying that we find the charge ridiculous. There's no evidence that Bayden has performed the necessary medical examinations to carry out such a diagnosis. We would have accepted the results of a study of the brain flow, or evidence that Piden tested Bush to see if he had an OK reaction. In fact, even people who disagree with the President about Iraq and disagree on other issues will admit that the President has spontaneous breathing and responds to incentives.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00326"}
