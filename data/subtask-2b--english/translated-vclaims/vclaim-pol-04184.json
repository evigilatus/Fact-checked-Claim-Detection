I promised, by running for Senate years ago, 200,000 jobs in the north of New York State. It was a disaster, \"Trap September 27 in Melbourne, no.\" Not only didn't they come, but they lost a lot of jobs, and you see it now. It's very sad to see what happened in North New York. It's a disaster.\" During the 2000 Senate race against Republican Rick Lazio, Clinton published ads saying, \"Hilary has a plan to create 200,000 jobs.\" A promising campaign has also been launched in the region, according to news reports since then. Clinton, of course, won the race and went to serve eight years before being named Secretary of State. But did he keep her promise? The Trump campaign referred to the Washington Post analysis of Clinton's pledge. The story concluded that her efforts had been interrupted, but it did not say that the region had also lost jobs. Meanwhile, Clinton's campaign sent us aggregate figures using data from the New York Department of Labor. In this calculation, North New York added about 100,000 jobs from the year before the first year of Clinton in the Senate (2000) to the previous year (2008). It should be noted, however, that this number accounts for all jobs, including those in government and local government. Clinton camp is also the Hudson Valley area, which includes five provinces not considered by the state government north of New York State. Furthermore, data are derived from a sample unemployment survey that determines the place of work based on a person &apos; s place of residence rather than the place of work. For example, a resident of Westchester County who works for the New York City government will be counted as an employee of the North State of New York by the Clinton Camp account. If we look only at jobs in the private sector and at the global counting of the workplace based on where it already exists, net job gains in North New York are less impressive. We used the quarterly Census of the Bureau of Labour Statistics for Employment and Wages, and three different definitions for the North New York region. In its broadest sense, the region refers to everywhere in the state except New York City and Long Island. Another definition also excludes Westchester County in the Hudson Valley. The third, used by the state government, penetrates four other provinces in the lower states. Whatever way you split the state, Trump's right that Clinton didn't achieve the goal of her job in the private sector. His claim that the region has already lost its functions is accurate for the two more stringent definitions. Trump, working in the public sector, is still right that Clinton has not fulfilled her pledge, but he is wrong that the region has lost its functions. According to the three definitions for the North New York region, the region has in fact added jobs, although not nearly as much as Clinton promised. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 On January 11, 2021 in North New York, the recovery force from the recession in 2000 was not as strong as the rest of the state or the country in general. :: During Clinton &apos; s term in the Senate and before the recession in 2008, the State of New York received some 134,000 jobs (85,000 in the private sector) while the country added some 5 million jobs (3 million in the private sector). \"The Clinton campaign proposal to create 200,000 jobs seems to have been withdrawn from thin air, supported by no account or details of any particular policy proposal,\" said E.J. :: McMahon, Director of Research at the Empire Public Policy Centre, a financially conservative intellectual bank in Albany. David Schaffer, former president of the Albanian Institute of Public Policy, told Washington Post that the target of 200,000 jobs was unrealistic, but \"for her credit,\" Clinton tried. In its first year as a senator, Clinton introduced a number of bills aimed at stimulating employment creation in the State, such as a small tax exemption for businesses, modernization of technology infrastructure and financial and training assistance for local businesses and entrepreneurs. None of these proposals went anywhere. I tried again after a few years, but again to no avail. In her 2006 re-election campaign and 2008 bid for the White House, Clinton said she could not deliver because of opposition from the Bush administration and the Republican Congress. \"When I made the covenant, I was counting on the existence of the Democratic White House, the Democratic President, who shared my values about what we needed to do to make the economy work for all and to create common prosperity,\" she said in 2008. I followed, \"And as you know, despite the difficulties of the Bush administration and the Republican Congress for six years of my first term, I worked hard to create jobs, but obviously as President I will have more tools at my disposal.\" Our referee Trump said that Clinton promised to run for Senate years ago with 200,000 jobs in North New York. Not only did they come, they lost a lot of jobs.\" Trump is right that Clinton has failed to bring 200,000 jobs to North New York, whether you count all jobs or just jobs in the private sector. His claim that the region has already lost jobs is an accurate claim for private sector jobs. However, given the overall employment picture, the region has added between 3,800 and 52,000 jobs depending on how North New York is defined. We assess his claim mostly true. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/3c423d39-1e30-4f66-90eb-8a816d2eeb0e", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04184"}
