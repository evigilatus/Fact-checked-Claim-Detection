The latest estimate for this task is $33.9 million, with an emergency fund of 25 per cent, which means that the costs can be as high as $25 million or $42 million, according to figures reported by the National Network. The Friends of the Indian Point Park, the group that led efforts to move underground power lines and drop the poles and towers that support them, says that the project is worthwhile, mainly because it will remove what its members argue is an optical scourge along the eastern shores of Providence and Providence. Burying the lines would improve the landscape of the park and make the vacant land near Route 195 more marketable -- and more valuable, arguing with the group. \"The proximity to high PV lines reduces property values by up to 30%,\" says the group on its website, adding that multiple studies prove it. We were curious if there really was a negative impact on property values, and if there was, whether that was significant. We contacted David Riley, Co-Chair of Friends of the Indian Point Park, for further information. He sent us a lot of documents and references to support the prosecution - buried in the information, so to speak - but we decided to start a paper published in 2010 in the magazine Real Estate Literature, which he quotes on his group's website. That paper, written by a professor and colleague of the University of Texas A&M, reviewed more than half a century of studies on the effects of electric transmission lines on property values. The studies included a 1992 resident survey, where most respondents said that high voltage electricity lines would reduce the market value of close ownership by an average of 10 per cent. It also included analyses of sales prices. Many of them were inconclusive or failed to quantify the impact. One model in 1979 projected a 6 per cent decrease for homes with a height of 50 to 200 feet of electricity lines. Another study conducted in 1995 stated that the impact was less than 5 per cent depreciation, and another study conducted in 2002 in a region close to Montreal was on average 9.6 per cent. None mentioned a 30 per cent decrease. The authors said that \"the studies they reviewed, although containing some inconsistencies in their detailed findings, generally point to small or no effects on sales prices due to the existence of transmission lines.\" This does not seem to support the Providence Group's claim. We looked at what Riley sent us. His documents included a summary of the aforementioned Montreal study, which described the negative impact of prices as \"between 5% and 20%.\" We got a copy of the 2002 study. Although she said that the average decline was lower, she found a 21 per cent drop in the prices of house sales in an area 50 feet away from high voltage electricity lines. We found separate studies in Canada regarding power lines outside Vancouver that found negative price effects of up to 27 per cent for nearby houses, according to a report on the Alberta transmission line proposal. Facebook published on January 27, 2021, in Facebook, says that Joe Biden canceled the Keystone pipeline because Warren Buffett \"doned $58 million\" for his campaign. By Tom Kircher \u2022 on January 29, 2012, Riley also sent us a portion of a property value report near an energy line outside Houston. The 1993 report found that the estimated values of properties affecting the rise of the power line were 31 per cent lower than those that were far away. He sent an excerpt from the 2012 Montana Sales Report, which found a decrease in the value of houses in a subdivision near a 25 to 30 per cent transmission line. Finally, we found two references (here and here) to a study in Quebec that found that the values of second residential plots near a high voltage power line along recreational lands were 34 per cent lower than expected. Because studying in French -- and it was our last French class in high school -- we were relying on secondary sources that summarized it. We contacted the real estate resident of Providence Tom Andolfo, who presided over the Rhode Island chapters at the Institute of Evaluation and the Board of Real Estate Evaluation, for his opinion. In a certificate to state regulators in 1994 on the removal of energy lines that pass from Eastern Providence to Providence, he mentioned 31% of Houston's study. But he told us he thought the actual impact wasn't as great as it was. He said, \"The real number could be 5 to 15%,\" he said. But Riley said he believed that because of the power lines passing through East Providence and Providence on water, the impact on property values was likely to be in the upper range of figures mentioned in the studies. \"It seems logical to me that power lines that impede water supply are more likely to suppress property than wires before, for example, buildings, because they will be clearer and hinder a more enjoyable and valued view that owners pay for.\" Our rule, \"The Friends of India Point Park,\" says that proximity to high voltage power lines reduces property values by up to 30%. There are many studies on the effects of power lines on property values. Almost all of the ones we found are determined that there was a negative impact on values. However, it varies considerably in what is actually the effect. Most of them put it under 10%. However, four studies were found in the United States and Canada, which found decreases ranging from approximately 30 per cent to over 30 per cent. They appear to be isolated cases, but they have already occurred, according to the studies. The friends of the Indian Point Park do not say that such a price effect is the rule. The group only says that the decline in value can be as high as 30 per cent. Riley says the language was chosen on purpose. There's also some question about the meaning of the group by \"nearness,\" but we're not going to get into it here. Because the statement is partly accurate, but it leaves important details -- most studies that show that the value of the property is down 10% or less -- we evaluate it in half right.
