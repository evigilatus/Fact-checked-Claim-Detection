Sheldon Whitehouse, the lead sponsor of the so-called \"Buffet Rule\" legislation -- asked how Romney would respond to the tax plan.\n\nAs part of his introduction to the question, Hinckley dismissed the bill as part of the \"politics of envy\" and described it as \"a plan that is so obviously political because it raises virtually no money, maybe a day and a half of our borrowing per year.\"\n\nThe bill, \u00a0which is officially known as the Paying a Fair Share Act, would increase the income tax rate on those who earn more than $1 million annually to 30 percent. It was inspired by billionaire investor Warren Buffett, who has said it is unfair that he is able to use tax loopholes to pay a lower effective rate than his secretary. The Senate is set to vote on the bill Monday.\n\nOther opponents of the legislation have questioned how much money it would actually raise and whether it would make a dent in the national debt. But does the amount really correspond to just \"a day and a half\" of what the United States borrows annually?\n\nHinckley\u2019s statement relies on two numbers -- how much the nation borrows on a daily basis and how much the Buffet rule would raise per year.\n\nWhile we waited to hear back from Hinckley\u2019s campaign, we started researching the issue, starting with what the federal government borrows to cover the national debt, a subject we have explored before. PolitiFact Florida and PolitiFact Georgia also have all written pieces on the national debt and what it works out to per day.\n\nWe\u2019ll use the same rationale as those items from 2011 but update the numbers. The national debt is the total amount of money owed by the federal government to creditors who have loaned the government money.\n\nThat debt has grown by an average of $4.2 billion per day since January 2009. The rate has slowed down more recently. Since January 2012, the average daily increase has been about $3.9 billion. The total debt stood at $15.6 trillion as of April 11, according to the U.S. Department of the Treasury.\n\nAs Politifact Florida made clear, the government does not borrow money every day to stay afloat. Rather, it does so by periodically auctioning bonds. But the logic of calculating the borrowing per day is reasonable. For our purposes, we\u2019ll use a rate of borrowing of $3.9 billion per day.\n\nThe second part of Hinckley\u2019s statement -- how much the Buffett rule would raise -- is based on a projection from Congress\u2019 Joint Committee on Taxation, according to Whitehouse spokesman Seth Larson. The committee estimated that increasing the tax rate paid by the wealthiest Americans would raise $47 billion over 10 years, or $4.7 billion a year.\n\nBut that estimate is based on a comparison to the \"current law baseline,\" which assumes the full expiration of the Bush tax cuts. \u00a0\n\nIf the Bush tax cuts are extended -- a distinct possibility with a Republican-controlled House -- then the Buffet rule would raise $160 billion over 10 years, or $16 billion a year.\n\nBoth are valid estimates.\n\n\"They\u2019re two separate projections based on two different scenarios,\" said Larson.\n\nA spokesman for Hinckley said that the candidate used the $4.7 billion figure and a range of estimates for borrowing that, at the high end, is nearly identical to our number. So if we divide $4.7 billion by $3.9 billion, we get 1.2, or the equivalent of 1 day and about 5 hours. That\u2019s actually less than a day and a half.\n\nIf we use the $16 billion figure, we calculated the Buffet rule would raise the equivalent of about four days of the nation\u2019s borrowing.\n\nOur ruling\n\nSenate candidate Barry Hinckley says the Buffett rule would annually raise only \"a day and a half\" of what the federal government borrows every year.\n\nOur calculations yield a number closer to a day and a quarter, which would actually bolster Hinckley\u2019s point that the tax plan raises \"virtually no money.\"\n\nIn relative terms, he may have a point, but $4.7 billion is not a small amount of money. (Rhode Island\u2019s total budget is $7.7 billion.) Moreover, by another estimate, increasing taxes on the wealthy could raise $16 billion a year, or the equivalent of four days of the nation\u2019s borrowing.\n\nBecause of that issue and others related to calculating the national debt per day, Hinckley\u2019s is not a perfect comparison. Because the statement needs clarification, we rate it Mostly True.\n\n(Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.
