Further false lists of alleged passengers of Lulita Express can be found on the Internet, including President Barack Obama, former Vice-President Joe Biden, former United States Senator Hillary Clinton, the late John McCain, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and even Pope Francis, to name but a few.
