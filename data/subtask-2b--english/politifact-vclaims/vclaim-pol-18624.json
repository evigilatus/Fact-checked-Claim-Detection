It was.\nWe asked the Biden campaign about what he was referring to when he said \"he got two or three.\" The Biden campaign didn\u2019t reply to our questions seeking clarification.\nObama\u2019s clemency actions were a fraction of what Biden said\nArticle II, Section 2, of the Constitution says the president \"shall have the Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for offenses against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.\"\u00a0\nThe general term for these presidential actions is clemency, but there are two types. A pardon, described as an \"expression of the President\u2019s forgiveness,\" is issued after a person\u2019s conviction or after a person\u2019s sentence has been completed. It restores rights, such as the right to vote or run for office. A commutation reduces a sentence, either totally or partially, but it does not remove the conviction.\nOver his two terms, Obama issued 212 pardons and 1,715 commutations, for a total of 1,927 acts of clemency, according to federal Department of Justice data. The Biden campaign said he misspoke and meant to say about 1,800, but instead said 18,000.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump has taken 38 clemency actions during his nearly four years in office, according to data through Sept. 8.\nExperts previously told us that Obama followed a policy of clemency actions aimed at low-level criminals who were given long sentences many years ago, and he followed recommendations made by the Justice Department. Trump has largely acted on his own based on recommendations from friends, celebrities, media personalities and business colleagues.\nIn July, the White House announced that Trump commuted the sentence of longtime confidant Roger Stone on charges stemming from Robert Mueller\u2019s special counsel investigation. Trump\u2019s announcement occurred days before Stone was set to begin a 40-month prison sentence.\nIn announcing Trump\u2019s clemency actions in February, the White House cited the election of Edward DeBartolo Jr. to the Pro Football Hall of Fame as an NFL team owner and his charitable contributions; called Michael Milken one of America\u2019s greatest financiers and noted his philanthropic work; and praised former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich for tutoring and mentoring fellow prisoners. (You can read more about their crimes here.)\nTrump has taken some steps toward criminal justice reform. In December 2018, Trump signed the First Step Act of 2018, which the Washington Post described as \"the most far-reaching overhaul of the criminal justice system in a generation.\"\u00a0\nRELATED: Super Bowl Ad Watch: Trump on criminal justice reform\nOur ruling\nBiden said that during the Obama/Biden administration \"18,000 people ... got clemency.\"\nBiden misspoke and meant to say 1,800 got clemency.
