John Cornyn in the 2014 Republican primary says Cornyn is vulnerable from the right.\nIn a Dec. 10, 2013, blog post on his campaign website, Steve Stockman of Friendswood specified: \"In every poll liberal John Cornyn always loses to any conservative the voters have heard about.\"\nCalling Cornyn liberal is questionable, though we see that as Stockman\u2019s opinion and not something that we could put to the Texas Truth-O-Meter. Suffice to say that Cornyn came out as the Senate\u2019s second-least liberal and second-most conservative member in a February 2013 vote analysis by National Journal magazine.\nWe turned instead to whether every poll shows Cornyn losing re-election to \"any conservative the voters have heard about.\"\nVoter polls\nUnfortunately, we failed to hear back from Stockman as we weighed the results of three fall 2013 voter polls testing Cornyn for re-election against particular possible Republican foes.\nAn October 2013 poll by the University of Texas and Texas Tribune showed Cornyn leading at 39 percent against two little-known opponents, Dwayne Stovall and Erick Wyatt. Forty-eight percent of respondents had no opinion.\nOn Nov. 14, 2013, UT government lecturer Jim Henson, one of the pollsters, wrote for the Tribune that this was \"by no means a forceful showing for an incumbent senator in a state as red as Texas, and has further fueled whispers of a primary challenge.\" Elaborating by email, Henson told us Cornyn saw his voter favorability ratings among Texas conservatives drop through the summer, \"which helped fuel further talk of a challenge from the right.\"\nNeither Stovall or Wyatt was widely known when the poll was taken, Henson said.\nPer Stockmn\u2019s focus on Republicans Texans had \"heard about,\" Henson offered: \"I think it would roughly be fair to say that anyone who has previously run statewide or nationally, or has in some other way been the subject of media exposure, could be referred to as someone people have \u2018heard about.\u2019\"\nTwo polls to go.\nIn early November 2013, a survey taken by North Carolina-based Public Policy Polling indicated Cornyn was not the favorite of 388 past Republican primary voters, who by 49 percent to 33 percent indicated they would prefer a more conservative nominee.\nThat poll also showed Cornyn ahead in hypothetical one-on-one faceoffs with two party figures and trailing another hypothetical challenger. According to a Nov. 6, 2013, press release on the results, Cornyn ran ahead of Biblical historian David Barton, former vice chairman of the Republican Party of Texas, by 51 percent to 18 percent, and led U.S. Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Tyler, by 40 percent to 31 percent.\nThe poll also asked about a hypothetical matchup between Cornyn and Gov. Rick Perry. The result: Perry drew 46 percent to Cornyn\u2019s 35 percent. (Perry, of course, is not challenging Cornyn and has, in fact, endorsed him.)\nBy email, PPP spokesman Tom Jensen noted that 38 percent of the polled voters had an opinion of Gohmert. Jensen said the firm did not poll on Barton\u2019s name recognition, \"but it doubtless would have been lower.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJensen wrote: \"My bar of whether voters have heard about a candidate would be whether they have 50% name recognition,\" meaning half or more of the voters recognize the candidate\u2019s name. \"Perry was the only one we tested who fit that bill. So Stockman\u2019s statement might be true at some level but it\u2019s not particularly compelling since there really just wasn\u2019t much polling out there testing Cornyn against anyone who voters are very familiar with.\"\nNext, Jensen pointed us to an Oct. 26, 2013, poll by Human Events and Florida-based Gravis Marketing indicating that a generic \"Tea Party\" candidate, unnamed, would lead Cornyn among Republicans by 46 percent to 33 percent, according to a Gravis Marketing summary. The poll involved 563 Republicans, the firm said, and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.\nAccording to the summary, Cornyn led several hypothetical one-on-one races--including versus Stockman. The summary says Cornyn led Gohmert in its polls by 45 percent to 20 percent and ran ahead of Stockman, 41 percent to 15 percent.\nBut Cornyn trailed in a one-on-one matchup with U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, who has run for president several times, 44 percent to 34 percent, the summary states.\nWe wondered about a seeming conflict in the Gravis results: Cornyn outpacing Rafael Cruz, whose son, Ted, is the junior senator from Texas, by 39 percent to 33 percent, in their hypothetical one-on-one matchup yet in a later poll result, the elder Cruz leading Cornyn, Paul and Stockman in a hypothetical four-way primary.\nThe latter question was: \"If the Republican primary were held today, would you vote for Cornyn, Cruz, Paul or Stockman?\" The results: Cruz, 41 percent, Cornyn at 25 percent, Paul at 18 percent and Stockman at 3 percent.\nBy telephone, the president of Gravis Marketing, Doug Kaplan, told us he suspects some poll respondents answering the four-way question thought they were considering a Ted Cruz candidacy against Cornyn rather than a race involving his father, with the erroneous effect being a boost to the elder Cruz\u2019s poll standing. \"I\u2019m not confident with the way we worded that question,\" Kaplan said.\nCornyn\u2019s objection\nTo our inquiry, Cornyn\u2019s Senate campaign disputed Stockman\u2019s website statement.\nBy email, Cornyn spokesman Drew Brandewie pointed out that no one leading Cornyn \u00a0in the three polls was shown as attracting more than half the vote--in other words, winning the nomination outright.\nOn another front, Brandewie maintained that Texas Republicans have \"heard about\" the two candidates bested by Cornyn in the UT/Tribune poll as well as Barton, Gohmert and the elder Cruz, each of whom did not lead Cornyn in the polled one-on-one matchups.\nOur ruling\nStockman said: \"In every poll,\" John Cornyn \"always loses to any conservative the voters have heard about.\"\nIn Stockman's favor, recent polling suggests Cornyn trailing Perry and Paul, two well-known Republicans, in hypothetical one-on-one matches.\nBut polls also have shown Cornyn running ahead of Barton, Gohmert and Stockman. These Texans are almost certainly less known than Paul and Perry, both of whom ran for president. Yet Gohmert and Stockman are members of Congress and Barton has long been a grass-roots leader. We think it reasonable to consider each one a conservative that \"voters have heard about,\" which makes Stockman\u2019s statement False.\n\nFALSE \u2013 The statement is not accurate.\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08507"}
