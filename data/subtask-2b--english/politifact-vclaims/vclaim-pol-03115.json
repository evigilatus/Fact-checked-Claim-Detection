Nancy Pelosi\u2019s daughters were arrested for smuggling drugs, but the articles are so inaccurate, they don\u2019t even bother to consistently use the same fake names.\nThe bogus saga of the House minority leader\u2019s children is widespread and convoluted: Facebook users flagged a string of stories starting on July 6, 2017, appearing on wazanews.tk, as part of the social media site\u2019s efforts to combat fake news.\nThe posts all invoked Pelosi\u2019s name, but details from story to story did not agree. Essentially, the articles said two of the California Democrat\u2019s adult daughters had been arrested for smuggling cocaine.\nBut the details of what happened after that premise was asserted varied wildly in the following days.\nAt first the women were said to be caught in Berkeley, Calif., with more than 200 pounds of cocaine in their Winnebago. Later stories claimed they were apprehended at the Mexican border. The yarn went on and on, across several posts.\nThe gist is that the women ran a drug ring out of a pool house, and agreed to turn on their mother after they were caught. Somehow Nancy Pelosi faced charges for ethical violations, breaking federal drug laws and committing treason. (It\u2019s never really specified how.)\u00a0\u00a0\nEventually Hillary Clinton was implicated, and the women were in protective custody when the cabin in which they were staying burned down. They turned up alive in Buffalo, N.Y., however, so all was well.\nWazanews.tk is a website registered in Amsterdam, but the stories appeared to originate on OurLandOfTheFree.com, FreedomCrossroads.us or TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a site run by Christopher Blair. He writes absurd stories about Democrats with the goal of tricking conservative readers into believing they (and his website) are real.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOurLandOfTheFree.com said it \"makes no guarantee that anything you find here will be based at all in reality.\" FreedomCrossroads.us has an About Us page that claims the site \"uses facts that don\u2019t exist and relies more on imagination than the truth.\"\nThe posts don\u2019t align very well, with details varying from story to story, such as the women\u2019s ages or even names, which change constantly.\nSometimes the pair are called Heather and Nicole. Or maybe Julie Marie and Nicole Lynn. Or Jillian and Veronica. Or Amber and Carly. Or Louanne and Marissa.\nFor the record, Pelosi\u2019s five children are daughters Christine, Alexandra, Jacqueline and Nancy, and one son named Paul.\nAt least a couple of images used on posts were actually of two women arrested for smuggling drugs. But those photos were of a pair of Scots arrested in Peru for trying to sneak cocaine to Spain in 2013.\nThe grand finale is a July 9 post on TheLastLineOfDefense.org under the headline, \"Liberal troll paid $100K for Nancy Pelosi drug bust hoax.\"\nThe post said George Soros paid the author to fool people for his own amusement, but that \"in the end, everyone knows Pelosi is guilty and (Hillary) Clinton is behind everything.\"\nDon\u2019t be fooled by tales of Pelosi\u2019s daughters being busted for drugs. It\u2019s a fictional soap opera created to amuse trolls.\nWe rate this claim Pants On Fire!\n Share the Facts 2017-07-13 14:51:55 UTC   PolitiFact    1 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Pants on Fire  Says two of U.S. Rep.
