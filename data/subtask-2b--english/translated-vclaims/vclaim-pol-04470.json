All actions must be directed towards this goal and any State participating in this objective will be our ally.\" He added: \"We will also work very closely with NATO in this new task. I have already said that NATO is out of date because it has not adequately addressed terrorism. Since my comments, they have changed their policy and now have a new section focusing on terrorist threats.\" Trump has made it public that NATO may be \"demobilized\" because NATO is \"not intended for terrorism.\" However, we wondered whether he was right to say that the United States-led military alliance \"has changed their policy and now (has) a new division focusing on terrorist threats.\" As has been shown, we have found little precision in this statement. What change does NATO refer to? We did not hear a reply from the Trump campaign, and unlike other parts of the prepared letter, this allegation was not specifically documented by footnotes. However, when we investigated NATO experts and terrorism, many said that the best change Trump could have pointed out was the creation of an Assistant Secretary-General for Intelligence and Security to head a newly established Joint Intelligence and Security Division. Trump had already quoted the story of Wall Street Journal on the news and the Alliance said, \"Making change without giving me credit.\" The new position was formally announced in a statement issued by representatives of member States at a summit held in Warsaw, Poland, on 9 July 2016. Here the document states: \"In order for the Alliance to respond to emerging threats, NATO intelligence reform must be an ongoing and dynamic process. To improve NATO &apos; s ability to benefit from a wide range of intelligence sources, we agreed to establish a new Joint Intelligence and Security Division headed by an Assistant Secretary-General for Intelligence and Security. The new Assistant Secretary-General for Intelligence and Security will direct NATO intelligence and security activities, ensuring better use of existing personnel and resources, while maximizing the efficiency of the use of NATO intelligence.\" Was that a big change? Not exactly what the experts say. :: Saidman, Professor of International Affairs, Carlton University, Canada, who received a fellowship in the United States Joint Staff of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 2001. \"Every year or two, there is a debate on how to improve the exchange of information.\" This change, as he said, was \"not so important.\" Jorge Benitez, NATO Director of the Atlantic Council, agreed. \"while the highest position is new, it appears that most staff will come from an internal reorganization of the NATO bureaucracy, rather than adding new additions,\" he said: \"This is because the summit statement describes this new NATO division as \"good use of existing personnel and resources.\" More importantly, Trump's comment gives the impression that NATO was not responsive to terrorism until the new division was established. That's not true at all. On 13 January 2021, in a story in which General David Berger, the commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for the use of marines for security, told her \"We are not working for you.\" On 17 January 2021, NATO issued its first official declaration on terrorism in 1980, and became an important issue for the Alliance on 11 September 2001, Liza Sawyer Samp, a senior colleague in the international security programme of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) protested article 5, its collective defensive ruling, the day after the attacks of 11 September, and has focused on dealing with this threat since then, including most importantly through the deployment of 12 years of troops in Afghanistan,\" said Ivo H. Dahlder, President of the Chicago Council for Global Affairs, who had previously served as NATO Ambassador to President Barack Obama. Benitez said that NATO and its partners had, at its peak, sent some 40,000 troops to Afghanistan, and this year there are still some 4,000 NATO allies in Afghanistan. \"It is impossible to say that NATO did not play an overwhelmingly important role in the fight against terrorism,\" said Timothy Andrews Sail, Assistant Professor of Modern Global Security at the University of Toronto. It should be noted that the structure and role of NATO, according to experts, have made it an incomplete tool in the fight against terrorism. \"Allied war is exceptionally difficult and fraught with problems of coordination and compromise,\" said Sail. The exchange of intelligence has been a particular challenge - the failure of the design of the new situation to mitigate it. The NATO terrorist scheme in the post-9/11 period has undergone one major reform -- but this happened in 2012, several years before Trump started running for president. The reform, as announced at a summit in Wales, states that \"the Alliance seeks at all times to remain aware of the evolving threat of terrorism; and to ensure that it has sufficient capacity to prevent, protect and respond to terrorist threats.\" \"So it took about a decade to update the initial post-9/11 framework for dealing with terrorism,\" said Matthew Faye, Defense Policy Analyst with Niskannen Center. Did Trump have anything to do with it? Despite Trump's desire to gain credit, this is the part where his statement is derailed. Trump strongly points out that NATO acted because of its concerns. However, experts agree that nothing of this kind has happened. First, the experts said that NATO leaders felt little warmth towards Tramp, noting that they would do nothing to enhance his chances of assuming the presidency. Faye said: \"It is terrible to suggest that NATO change its counter-terrorism policy in response to anything Donald Trump said about him during his campaign.\" \"Like his claim that he was against the invasion of Iraq, this is another reflection of the Republican candidate who lives in the foreign policy world of his own creature.\" More importantly, they are structural obstacles - that is, a broad alliance like NATO tends to take longer to get all its members to sign strategic changes. \"This is almost certainly just a strange coincidence,\" said Sail. The situation will be the result of a very long trick by those who preferred the idea against those who might think that the alliance is too big and too dispersed to be effective - or safe - to exchange detailed intelligence. Saidman agreed. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is not working quickly on anything, and most of the major changes are announced at summits such as the Warsaw Summit or smaller meetings where defence ministers and foreign ministers meet. Finally, NATO rejected the idea that Trump had anything to do with the change in his statement to Pol\u00edtico. Our Governor Trump said, \"I said earlier that NATO was out of date because it failed to deal adequately with terrorism. Since my comments, they have changed their policy and now have a new section focusing on terrorist threats.\" The change he seems to refer to - the creation of a new senior post and a division to coordinate the exchange of intelligence - is only the most gradual change in how the Alliance has dealt with counter-terrorism, a subject that the Alliance has dealt with, in large and small ways, for more than 30 years. There is no evidence that the change was made in response to Trump &apos; s complaints about the Alliance. The experts said that such changes usually required a longer period of pregnancy in order for all Member States to join them. We also appreciate Trump's false establishment. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/8a31e8b2a03-46dc-a5d1-f4bd0191fd1", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04470"}
