Rob Portman says the Obama administration has put out more major rules than other recent administrations", "text": "Because we deal with lots of loose rhetoric at PolitiFact Ohio, we\u2019re attracted like a magnet to any claim that tries to actually quantify a political or ideological point. Ohio U.S. Sen. Rob Portman delivered such a tidbit during a conference call with Ohio reporters on May 23.\n\nPortman was explaining a bill he co-introduced that could require additional cost-benefit analysis and allow more business flexibility before new federal regulations and rules could be issued. Portman says too many government regulations are imposed without a commonsense assessment of their burden on businesses and jobs. And he said that President Barack Obama\u2019s administration has put out \"more of these major rules than the Clinton administration or the Bush administration during comparable times.\"\n\nWe won\u2019t attempt to assess whether current and pending regulation of the environment, worker and food safety, \u00a0healthcare, wildlife or fuel efficiency are good or government overkill. But has the Obama administration finalized more of these \"major\" rules than other recent presidents? That part of the claim is measurable and has, in fact, been examined by groups of all political stripes, all using the same sources of government data.\n\nIf all regulations were counted, Obama\u2019s record would be nowhere near Portman\u2019s description, especially considering a sizeable flurry of rulemaking during Bill Clinton\u2019s first two years, as the liberal group OMB Watch, now known as the Center for Effective Government, said in a report last September. \u00a0In fact, when 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney claimed that federal regulations quadrupled under Obama, PolitiFact ruled it False.\n\nBut Portman said \"major\" rules.\" \"Major\" has a specific meaning when used by the government in this context. It means any rule with an economic impact of at least $100 million. And the White House Office of Management and Budget, or OMB, keeps track of these very rules, as does the Government Accountability Office. OMB calls them \"economically significant\" rules, which also has a distinct definition but is so close to \"major\" that there is no need to split hairs here.\n\nWe looked at three analyses of major or economically significant rules, all broken down by year and presidency and all using OMB data. \u00a0One was provided by Portman\u2019s Senate staff, which is familiar with the data because Portman used to run OMB. Another was from the Regulatory Studies Center at George Washington University, headed by Susan Dudley, a former regulatory affairs administrator at OMB. A third was from the Center for Effective Government.\n\nPortman\u2019s office compared rules that were finalized in the first three years of Obama\u2019s tenure with the first three of Clinton\u2019s and George W. Bush\u2019s. To guard against counting rules finalized by one administration but published by another, it excluded those that were published in the first few weeks of an incoming president\u2019s term. Portman\u2019s staff counted only executive branch departments and agencies and not those of independent agencies that do not report to the president.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n60 Plus Association\n\n\nstated on November 7, 2011 in a television commercial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn independent payment advisory board created by in the health care reform law is \"like a Medicare IRS with the power to cut Medicare in order to pay for new government programs.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Sabrina Eaton \u2022 November 25, 2011\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt found 162 major rules for Obama, 115 for the same period under Bush, and 135 for the same period under Clinton.\n\nA similar analysis by George Washington University\u2019s Regulatory Studies Center had a similar conclusion, though the raw numbers were slightly different from Portman\u2019s because of a technical variation in the timeframes counted. Among other things, the analysis counted every year the presidents served, allowing for comparisons of first and second terms for Clinton and Bush and the full four years of Obama\u2019s first term.\n\nThis made no substantive difference in terms of Portman\u2019s claim. It showed that Obama still had more economically significant rules -- 217 in his first four years, compared with the next highest, 190, in Bush\u2019s second term.\n\nFinally, there was the data from the Center for Effective Government, nee OMB Watch. Last September, it examined new regulations since 1992, and found the level fairly constant across presidencies, save for Clinton\u2019s first years. But when it came to regulations labeled as economically significant, Obama\u2019s record for the first 42 months of his presidency was 38 percent higher than the comparable period of Bush\u2019s first term and 36 percent higher than the comparable period in Clinton\u2019s.\n\nIn an interview and in her report, Randy Rabinowitz, director of regulatory policy at the Center for Effective Government, cautioned that some of these comparisons can be misleading because the \"major\" rule threshold of $100 million has not changed since 1978, despite inflation. A rule costing $100 million in 1993, the first year of Clinton\u2019s presidency, would cost $161 million today, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 online inflation calculator. We know of no analysis of regulations that has taken this into account.\n\nRabinowitz also noted that many regulations grow directly out of laws passed by Congress or ordered by courts, so presidents are not merely riding roughshod over the will of lawmakers or the public. Some of Obama\u2019s biggest rules resulted from court rulings dating to Bush, with courts requiring environmental regulation after Bush balked.\n\nBut Obama\u2019s share of these or similar statutory or judicially required rules -- 48 percent of all the rules his administration finalized -- was not much different from the share Clinton had to deal with in his first term, nor the share Bush had in his second term.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t change the facts or statistics as stated by Portman: The Obama administration has put out \"more of these major rules than the Clinton administration or the Bush administration during comparable times.\" We rate his claim True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09274"}
