Ted Strickland and incumbent Republican Sen. Rob Portman neck-in-neck.\nStrickland\u2019s latest tactic against Portman is to call him out for serving the billionaire class at the expense of Ohio\u2019s regular Joes.\nA campaign fundraising email from Strickland\u2019s campaign manager portrays Portman in the grips of dark outside spending, while Strickland takes in small donations from voters.\n\"While Rob Portman relies on his super PAC and a handful of billionaires to do his dirty work, we don\u2019t have a super PAC,\" wrote campaign manager\u00a0Rebecca Pearcey, \"and quite frankly, we don\u2019t want one that spends millions to spew out lies and distortions.\"\nWe recalled a similar claim by presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, whose own statement about not having a super PAC was fact-checked in the early months of the Democratic primary. We applied the same test to Strickland\u2019s campaign rhetoric.\nPortman has an affiliated super PAC, meaning it\u2019s dedicated solely to supporting him and opposing Strickland. Fighting for Ohio (though it\u2019s registered in Alexandria, Va.) has spent more than $1.68 million against Strickland so far, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\nTop contributors to Fighting for Ohio include Kenneth Griffin, founder and CEO of global investment firm Citadel ($250,000); Paul Singer, hedge fund manager of Elliott Management Corporation ($250,000); Edyth Lindner, widow of Carl Lindner, former owner of the Cincinnati Reds and Chiquita Brands ($100,000).\nYes, Portman is funded by billionaires. But Strickland\u2019s appeal for cash neglects to mention how he also benefits from outside spending.\nSenate Majority PAC is an unaffiliated funder that pledges its support to Democrats running for the Senate. The PAC mostly pays for TV and digital attack ads against Republican candidates. In this election season, the PAC has lasered in on four major Senate battlegrounds: New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Nevada and Ohio. \u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden canceled the Keystone pipeline because Warren Buffett \u201cdonated $58 million\u201d to his campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonors to the Senate Majority PAC include George Marcus, real estate broker at Marcus & Millichap ($1 million); Fred Eychaner, Newsweb Corporation founder ($1 million); and actor/director\u00a0Seth MacFarlane\u00a0($500,000).\nAnyone can register an unaffiliated super PAC with the Federal Election Commission. This means even if the Senate Majority PAC\u2019s love for Strickland was unrequited, there\u2019s not much Strickland can do about it.\u00a0It\u2019s illegal for a candidate to coordinate with a super PAC, according to the Federal Election Commission rules. But such rules are rarely enforced\u00a0\u2014\u00a0since 1999, commissioners have only launched three investigations on candidate-super PAC contact.\nUnlike Sanders, who filed a cease-and-desist order against a PAC backing him, Strickland hasn't disavowed the\u00a0$1.75 million that the Senate Majority PAC has\u00a0spent\u00a0so far on the race\u00a0targeting\u00a0Portman. Strickland for Senate spokesman David Bergstein retweeted the Senate Majority PAC earlier this year.\nDonations from non-profits and ad buys aren\u2019t reported to the Federal Election Commission, further complicating the question of whose pockets are deeper.\n\"The picture can change in an instant, and we may not know who\u2019s truly ponying up the money on an ad to support a candidate,\" said Sheila Krumholz, the executive director at the Center for Responsive Politics. \"There\u2019s a lot of disingenuousness when candidates are saying, \u2018You have more money,\u2019 \u2018No, you have more money.\u2019 \"\nOur ruling\nA Strickland for Senate fundraising email said, \"While Rob Portman relies on his super PAC and a handful of billionaires to do his dirty work, we don\u2019t have a super PAC.\"\nStrickland doesn\u2019t have a super PAC solely focused on his campaign like the pro-Portman Fighting for Ohio. But big spenders still have Strickland\u2019s back. It isn\u2019t credible to say he\u2019s impervious to the influence of dark money while still enjoying its benefits.\nThe claim is partially accurate but takes things out of context.\u00a0We rate this claim Half\u00a0True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9d083367-2a63-48c5-9f3e-dd98d6775c7b", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04894"}
