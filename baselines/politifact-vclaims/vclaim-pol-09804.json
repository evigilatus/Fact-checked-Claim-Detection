Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., by noting that during his second inauguration, President Barack Obama barely mentioned the primary topic of the 2012 presidential election -- the economy.\n\nAfter playing some excerpts from Obama\u2019s inaugural speech, Hannity said, \"While Obama remains hell-bent on tackling national security threats like climate change, the president made no substantive references to economic matters like putting you the American people back to work.\"\n\nThen, welcoming McCarthy to the show, Hannity said, \"8.3 (million) fewer Americans are working today than there were four years ago. What is your reaction to that?\" (Hannity actually inadvertently failed to say the word \"million,\" but in context, it was clear what he meant, so we won\u2019t let that affect our ruling.)\n\nWe wondered whether it was really true that \"8.3 (million) fewer Americans are working today than there were four years ago.\"\n\nThere\u2019s an easy way to find out. The Bureau of Labor Statistics collects data on the number of Americans who are employed at any given time. Using their figures for total, nonfarm employment, there were 358,000 fewer people working in December 2012 than there were in December 2008 -- a far cry from 8.3 million.\n\nSo by this standard -- and we believe it\u2019s the correct one to use in this context -- Hannity is flat wrong. But the 8.3 million figure, which has been a hot topic in conservative circles recently, has a grain of truth to it.\n\nHannity\u2019s primary problem was sloppy phrasing. He referred to 8.3 million \"fewer Americans \u2026 working today,\" but he would have been on firmer ground if he\u2019d said that \"8.3 million more Americans are not working today\" compared to four years ago. That may sound like a distinction without a difference, but it\u2019s not.\n\nActually, it\u2019s crucial.\n\nWhat\u2019s at issue here are the number of Americans who have left the workforce during the past four years. The most frequently discussed economic statistics don\u2019t do a very good job documenting these workers, and why they make that decision. For instance, a worker may have a baby and leave to become a stay-at-home mom or dad. Or a recent college grad may detour into grad school.\n\nSome of these decisions may have happened anyway, regardless of the state of the job market. But some may decide to raise a child or go to grad school because the job market is poor.\n\nLet\u2019s look at where the 8.3 million figure emerged -- in an article in CNSNews.com, a conservative outlet. (The Fox News press office did not respond to an inquiry.) The article starts with BLS data for the number of Americans aged 16 and older, then subtracts the number who are employed. What\u2019s left refers to the number of Americans who are \"not working\" at any given time, for any reason.\n\nWe did our own calculation for the December 2008 to December 2012 time frame and found that CNSNews had actually understated the count. By our count, the number of Americans not working increased by almost 9.6 million.\n\nStill, let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves -- this number isn\u2019t all it\u2019s cracked up to be, either. Specifically, it\u2019s a big stretch to tie this increase to Obama, as Hannity clearly does based on his introductory video clips and comments. Why?\n\n\u2022 A big reason for the rise in non-working Americans is the graying of the Baby Boom generation, something Obama has no control over.\n\nWe looked at Census Bureau data to estimate the population of Americans aged 65 or more. There is no data for 2012, so we used the increase in the 65-and-over population from 2007 to 2011 instead. (Given demographic trends, the increase through 2012 would likely be higher, but we\u2019ll stick with the hard numbers.)\n\nWe found that the population aged 65 and over rose by 3.1 million between 2007 and 2011. So, 3.1 million of the 9.6 million more non-working Americans are due in large part to the aging of the population. That leaves a rise of roughly 6.5 million Americans that might, theoretically, be attributable to Obama and the economy he presided over.\n\nThat number, 6.5 million, is lower than Hannity\u2019s 8.3 million, but it\u2019s still pretty big. (To its credit, CNSNews offered a similar reduction using Social Security beneficiary data, lowering the number of non-workers under Obama to about 4.1 million -- though readers who saw the headline or skimmed the story likely would have missed it.)\n\nBut there\u2019s another important factor to consider:\n\n\u2022 The number of non-workers has been growing since well before Obama entered office.\n\nTo determine how different the economy was under Obama, you have to have a sense of what it was like before he became president. So we did exactly the same calculations for the four-year period immediately before he took office \u2013 December 2004 to December 2008, under President George W. Bush.\n\nIn the 2004-08 period, the number of non-working Americans rose by 7.2 million and the number of elderly rose (between 2003 and 2007) by 1.8 million. So the rise of non-workers not attributable to the elderly was 5.4 million.\n\nThis means the increase in non-workers was indeed bigger under Obama \u2013 there were more than 1 million extra non-workers under Obama than under Bush -- but the increase was quite a bit smaller than one would think from hearing Hannity\u2019s comment.\n\nExperts say that this is an important statistic to be concerned about, though they also caution that it\u2019s hard, if not impossible, to know what portion of these 1 million extra non-workers stems from Obama\u2019s policies. We don\u2019t know, after all, to what extent those leaving the job market are doing so because the economy is poor as opposed to other, more personal reasons.\n\n\"The idea of more Americans not working is a valid and interesting concept -- economists have been worried about this,\" said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist. \"There is clearly a downtrend in labor force participation. The question is how much of this would have happened without the recession -- or with different policies, or whatever the comparison is -- versus how much is long term trends, which we may or may not want to target with policies and may simply be due to demographics\" or changing attitudes.\n\nOur ruling\n\nHannity said that under President Barack Obama, \"8.3 (million) fewer Americans are working today than there were four years ago.\" That\u2019s simply wrong; the actual decrease in working Americans over that period was less than one-twentieth that amount.\n\nThere is reason to be concerned about a related, but distinct, statistic -- that there are perhaps 8 million or 9 million more Americans than there were four years ago who are not working, for a variety of reasons. But that number is heavily affected by the graying of the Baby Boom generation and by long-term patterns that have nothing to do with Obama -- and in any case, it\u2019s not what Hannity said. We rate Hannity\u2019s claim False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09804"}
