The announcement shows federal leaders and Obama speaking in favour of health-care reform, and then the Fox News anchor asks, \"Will Obama's administration exempt some from compliance with the new health-care law as a political service?\" The video shows Obama in a political rally, screaming, \"Because we fought together, we've worked together, walked the doors (door-to-door) for me, The screen text says, \"more than 185 union concessions. They're all exempt from the state of Obamacker. If trade unions do not have to comply with Obama's care system, why should we? We have spent a great deal of time considering this claim, because it is based on some very strange details of the new health-care law, things such as the limits of annual benefits, the gradual introduction into 2014 of the rules announced in the Federal Register. We will explain all of these details in a moment, but we will begin by giving you the conclusion: Trade unions must obey the mandates of health care law like any other organization. If there is concrete evidence that they are receiving special treatment, we have not found it. For the sake of simplicity, we will start from the beginning, before the Health Care Act is passed. Before the Health Care Act was passed, insurance companies could have set limits on what they wished to pay for health care per person per year. The typical annual limit for a person with very good insurance may be a million dollars, but it may be less, sometimes much less. If you are never sick, you may not be aware that the limit exists. But it would be a different story if you were sick, especially if you had something expensive to treat, like cancer. One in ten cancer patients, for example, consumes benefit limits and has to find more insurance or pay for treatment themselves, according to the United States Department of Health and Human Services. Low-wage workers are particularly vulnerable to plans with low annual limits. In some cases, annual payments are low to $2,000. These types of plans are often called \"Mini-Meds,\" and consumer advocates say it's almost always a bad deal. The Health Care Act goes beyond the annual limits of benefits so that people are not arrested without coverage, according to the Health and Health Survey. The phase-out began this year, with new rules stipulating that all insurance plans must provide at least $750,000 in payments per year. The number rises each year so that no ceiling is allowed by 2014 at all. But last year, companies began to complain, saying that if they had to meet the new requirements, they either had to increase the premiums paid by their employees or end the coverage completely. The Obama administration did not want this to happen, so it started granting concessions to the new rule. Exemptions to health plans will be granted annually until 2014, according to the Ministry of Health, when people can purchase standard health insurance policies using new \"exchanges\" at the state level. In the same year, low-wage workers will be eligible for tax exemptions to help them purchase insurance. \"We need to make sure that Americans who have today's insurance - even if it is too limited - can maintain this coverage until the reforms that would increase their ability to choose between comprehensive and affordable insurance options in 2014 come into effect,\" Stephen Larsen, who oversees the waiver process, said in his testimony to Congress in March. To date, employers such as McDonalds, Jack in the box, Cracker Barrel, and Oriele Otto Barts have successfully applied for waiver of their health plans. Other successful applicants include Senvio Vinyards of California, Securitas Securetas Assurance Services USA, Mesa Air Group and Dish Network. (See all applications approved here.) There are also several trade union health plans that form the basis of the claims contained in the Crossroad Declaration. We have contacted the Ministry of Health and have requested the number of concessions they have made so far. One speaker told us that she had approved 1,372 applications and rejected 92. Of the approved applications, 27 represented trade unions and 315 represented plans jointly managed by trade unions and employers. Even if I take the broadest possible definition, with all the common plans counted as union plans, only 25 percent of the concessions went to the unions. The remainder referred to plans submitted by employers, insurance companies and other non-union groups. However, concessions do not exempt these categories from the Health Care Act. It only allows them to continue submitting their current health plans within annual limits until 2014. It should be noted that some Republicans are strongly opposed to concessions. Two hearings were held in Congress on the reason for the waivers and whether the process was transparent. A law firm of CrossRoads GPS filed a federal lawsuit against the Human Security Service, claiming that the Agency did not respond promptly enough to its request for information on how to grant exemptions. The claim states that it seeks \"the criteria applied by the Ministry of Health in deciding whether to grant or reject requests for exemption from annual limitation requirements.\" On January 13, 2021, General David H. Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for the use of marines to secure the launch, and told her, \"We are not working for you.\" By Samantha Buterman: January 17, 2021, however, HHS said that he would agree to exemptions if \"the increase in premiums was significant or if a large number of registered people would lose access to their current plan because coverage would not be provided in the absence of a waiver.\" Special treatment? It should be noted that consumer advocates have mixed feelings about concessions. \"Our concern about the general waiver process is that it targets the same kind of health policy that health-care reform was intended to eliminate -- very low-benefit policies that cost consumers more than they deserved,\" said Carmen Palmer, Washington Director of the Non-Profit Consumer Control Group. In fact, we wondered why trade unions need concessions, because trade unions have a reputation for providing quality health-care benefits. The experts we talked to said that it could be one of two scenarios. In some cases, trade unions, like companies, may offer policies below the $750,000 ceiling. In other cases, trade union workers receive limited benefits while their private counterparts receive no benefits. The International Federation of Employees (IFCS) provided the example of Houston gatekeepers covered by a health plan with exception. \"It is important to remember that the coverage we are talking about is low-cost schemes that cover low-wage workers, some of whom have not received health care coverage in their lives,\" said the Federation in a statement, after asking us about this issue. But we cannot say with certainty what plans might fit any category, because the Ministry of Health has not published all the details of the plans that get these concessions. The Agency issues information on the company submitting the plan, the number of workers covered and the dates of submission and approval of applications. However, it does not state what the annual limits or other details of health plans are. When we asked the GPS about the announcement, a spokesman referred to the lack of transparency in the approval process and claimed that a disproportionate number of concessions were to trade unions, because only 11.9 per cent of the country was federal. The Obama administration \"at the very least gives the appearance that concessions go to those with political ties,\" said the spokesman for Jonathan Cooligio. But Palmer said she didn't see any evidence that the unions were receiving special treatment. She said, \"Almost anyone made a request and received them.\" The claim that this was a special treatment falls a little flat. As a consumer organization, we believe that concessions were granted on a very large scale, but HHS was consistent.\" We also reviewed the latest certificate in Congress on how to grant exemptions. None of the witnesses provided evidence of special treatment. The Republic questioned Elijah Cummings, D-MD, Director of Exemptions on this point, and specifically asked about the complaints submitted by the Republic, Daryl Issa, R-Calif, Chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on State Control and Reform. \"Now some critics have suggested that the process by which annual exemptions are issued is biased and favours certain groups such as trade unions. For example, President Issa made this statement on 10 February 2010, from which I quote: \"The current process gives credence to the perception that bureaucrats choose winners and losers in a politicized environment where winners prefer management circles. ........................................................................ that is not true................................................ We do not favour any particular type of applicant, or any applicant from a particular sector, and we have fairly applied the criteria we have set among all applicants.\" Summary: \"Is political support for Obama's administration or health-care reform a factor used by your office to evaluate requests for annual waivers?\" ........................................................................................... it is not....................................... \"And do you understand that you're under oath?\" ........................................................................... In judging this statement, we understand that the Obama administration will not recognize it if it grants special treatment to unions. However, given the number of concessions granted to both trade union and non-union groups, we do not see any pattern that would support the issue of special treatment. The number of exemptions represents a small sample of all health plans, and much more exemptions have been given to large companies and companies. We searched for additional information or evidence on this point and did not find it. However, there are additional problems with the Declaration. The announcement does not state that exemptions apply only to annual coverage limits, that they are intended to be valid only until 2014, and that many profit-making companies have received the same exemptions. It gives the impression that trade unions are completely exempt from the Health Care Act, and they are not. Since the announcement gives the impression that trade unions are exempt from the entire law, and because their evidence of special treatment is very little, we value this claim on fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13054"}
