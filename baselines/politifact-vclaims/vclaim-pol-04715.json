Mark Warner says presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has a \"lot of ammunition\" to fire at Donald Trump\u2019s business record.\n\"To think that Mr. Trump is trying to lay out this proposition that he\u2019s a successful business guy. He\u2019s failed miserably, bankrupt four separate businesses,\" Warner, D-Va., said during a June 21 interview on CNN.\nWe looked at Warner\u2019s contention that Trump bankrupted four businesses. Clinton has made similar charges against the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, including on July 6 when she spoke in front of the shuttered Trump Plaza Casino and Hotel in Atlantic City, N.J..\nEarlier this year, many of Trump\u2019s GOP primary opponents also accused him of running businesses into the ground.\nKevin Hall, Warner\u2019s communications director, sent us a series of media reports about Trump\u2019s business problems.\nSome Trump companies indeed have sought protection under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law, which shields businesses from creditors as as they reorganize with hope of remaining open. Under court supervision, the companies devise a plan to pay back some of its liabilities over time. That\u2019s different from a Chapter 7 filing, which involves liquidating a company\u2019s assets and distributing the proceeds to creditors.\nPolitiFact National has explored several claims about Trump\u2019s business record and has tallied a list of bankruptcies for his companies. Let\u2019s take a look.\n1991 bankruptcy\nTrump\u2019s first bankruptcy came when he sought protection for the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City.\nTrump funded most of the casino\u2019s $1 billion construction by using junk bonds with high interest rates, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. When it sought Chapter 11 protection a year after its opening, the casino had about $3 billion in debt.\nAs part of the restructuring, Trump cut his ownership stake in the Taj Mahal by half and sold his airline as well as his personal 282-foot yacht, The Washington Post said in an August 2015 story.\n1992 bankruptcies\nTwo more of Trump\u2019s Atlantic City casinos - the Trump Castle and Trump Plaza and Casino - sought Chapter 11 protection amid heavy debt and cash flow problems, United Press International reported at the time.\nA fourth bankruptcy also occurred in 1992 when Trump sought protection for The Plaza hotel in midtown Manhattan.\nThe hotel, which Trump bought for $390 million in 1988, had accumulated more than $550 million in debt. \u00a0Trump gave up a 49 percent ownership stake and remained CEO, although he had little control over the day-to-day operations of the company, according to The New York Times.\nMost recent bankruptcies\nTrump Hotels and Casinos Resorts filed for bankruptcy in 2004 when his casinos - including the Trump Taj Mahal, Trump Marina and Trump Plaza in Atlantic City, and a riverboat casino in Indiana - amassed an estimated $1.8 billion in debt, according to The Associated Press.\nTrump agreed to reduce his share in the company from 47 percent to 27 percent in a restructuring plan, but he still was the company\u2019s largest single shareholder and remained in charge of its operations.\nSeveral years later, Trump Entertainment Resorts - formerly Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts - was slammed by the Great Recession and missed a $53.1 million interest payment in December 2008, according to ABC News.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe company declared Chapter 11 in February 2009. After negotiating with the board of directors, Trump resigned as the company\u2019s chairman and had his corporate stake in the company reduced to 10 percent. The company continued to use Trump\u2019s name in licensing.\nAll told, the record shows that three of Trump\u2019s Atlantic City casinos as well as The Plaza hotel went bankrupt in the 1990s. His overall casino and resort company went bankrupt twice in the 2000s while operating under different names. So you could argue that five Trump companies have gone into bankruptcy.\nBeyond the numbers\nThe next question: Is Trump personally to blame for driving these ventures into bankruptcy, as Warner\u2019s statement says?\nTrump defends his use of bankruptcy laws, saying they\u2019ve allowed him to keep businesses afloat and that he\u2019s rarely relied on them during a career of making hundreds of business deals. In a statement released the day Clinton made her Atlantic City trip, Trump pegged the number of bankruptcies at four. \u00a0\n\"It is an effective and commonly used practice in business to use bankruptcy proceedings to restructure a business and ultimately save jobs,\" Trump said in a July 6 statement.\n\u00a0\nExperts told PolitiFact National last September that Trump has had a high number of bankruptcies. But they didn\u2019t entirely blame him for the Chapter 11 filings and noted that most occurred in the gambling industry, which has struggled.\nA 1991 article by United Press International about the financial woes of the Trump Castle and Trump Plaza and Casino said the Atlantic City gaming industry was \"depressed\" and that nine of the city\u2019s 12 casinos saw declining revenues in 1990, with those two Trump casinos seeing the biggest revenue losses.\nThe New York Times noted in a story earlier this month that Trump\u2019s share of the overall Atlantic City casino market started to fall in 1997, and that while revenues for non-Trump gaming ventures in the city rose over the following five years, revenue at Trump casinos declined.\nTrump told the newspaper that his casinos ran into trouble because they began competing against each other - a statement that The Times said was \"a tacit acknowledgement that he overbuilt.\"\nRoger Gros, publisher of Global Gaming Business magazine, told the Los Angeles Times last year that Trump put his Atlantic City casinos \"in so much debt that subsequent managers couldn't manage them properly.\"\nBut Michael Viscount, an Atlantic City lawyer who represented unsecured creditors during the 2004 Chapter 11 filing of the Trump Hotels and Casino resorts, doesn\u2019t blame Trump for the bankruptcies. He told Forbes magazine in 2011 that he didn\u2019t blame Trump for his Atlantic City casino bankruptcies. Viscount said creditors knew what they were getting into when they lent Trump money.\n\"They\u2019ve all played this game before, in the insolvency space. The company that possessed his name filed bankruptcy because it was overleveraged,\" Viscount told Forbes. \"What does that tell you? People want to lend him money. He does grandiose things with it.\"\nAdam Levitin, a law professor at Georgetown University, said in an August 2015 post on a blog dedicated to bankruptcy and credit issues that a Chapter 11 filing alone doesn\u2019t demonstrate a lack of business acumen. Sometimes businesses go bankrupt because of poor management, but sometimes it\u2019s because of factors beyond their control, Levitin wrote.\n\"And indeed, how much, if at all, was Trump involved in the management of the companies?\" Levitin wrote. \"I wouldn't be shocked if he was basically licensing his name.\"\nLevitin told PolitiFact National last September that it\u2019s not fair to put all the blame on Trump for his company\u2019s bankruptcies because he\u2019s acted as any investor would. Investors often own many non-integrated companies, which they fund by taking on debt, and some of them inevitably file for bankruptcy, Levitin said.\n\"The only difference is that Trump puts his name on his companies, which means people associate them with him, but he's not at all the leader in the bankruptcy space,\" Levitin said. \"These bankruptcies were not defining moments for Trump and shouldn't color our view of him.\"\nOur ruling\nWarner said Trump has \"bankrupt four separate businesses.\" The number, if anything, is conservative. We count five.\nBut beyond the number, Warner\u2019s statement also asserts that Trump was the cause of the bankruptcies, and that\u2019s harder to parse out. There\u2019s no doubt he had a role in many of the failings, having larded his casino operations with huge debts.\nBut analysts note that Trump wasn\u2019t acting alone; he had willing investors who put up big sums of money in the risky gaming industry. There\u2019s also questions about how involved he was in running all of the casinos that bore his name.\nSo on the whole, we rate Warner\u2019s statement Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04715"}
