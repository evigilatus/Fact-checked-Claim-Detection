The Trump comments came after the Democrats in the House of Representatives issued a list of 81 persons who would receive requests for documents relating to Congressional investigations. Here's what Trump said during the White House event on March 5th: \"Instead of doing infrastructure, instead of doing health care, instead of doing a lot of things they should do, they want to play. President Obama, from what they tell me, was under a similar kind of thing - he didn't give a single message. They didn't do anything. They did not give a single letter of request. Many requests were requested; they did not give a message.\" The fact that the Obama administration withheld all congressional demands for information is wrong. Four investigations of veterans from the Obama administration immediately opened fire. In 2011-2016, the White House produced hundreds of thousands of documents for Congress about Solendra and Benghazi, speed and anger, CAFE standards, deep-water spill, ACA, ACA website, clean water base, and fire on Ft Hood. https://t.co/V3qA99TBxm - Eric Schultz (@EricSchultz) 5 March 2019 and have a point. As we have stated, the Obama administration - contrary to what Trump previously confirmed - has been involved in major supervisory efforts in Congress. Here are some key investigations during Obama's presidency: lending to Solandra Solar. The company collapsed after receiving $535 million as a federal loan guarantee, and the Republicans noticed that Obama's campaign holder was a major investor. The failure to repay the loan led to an investigation by the Energy and Trade Commission of the Chamber of Deputies. \u2022 Alleged political bias in the Internal Revenue Service. This controversy involved accusations that IRS employees were unfairly targeting conservative groups to conduct an extraordinary examination of applications for a tax-free organization. This attracted an investigation by the House of Representatives Oversight and Government Reform Committee, the Senate Finance Committee and a Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security and Government Affairs. \u2022 The terrorist attack by the Benghazi Consulate in 2012, in which four Americans, including the American Ambassador, died. The circumstances surrounding the attack were investigated by the Intelligence Committee of the Senate, the Internal Security and Government Committee of the Senate, several teams of the House of Representatives under the leadership of the Intelligence Committee of the House of Representatives and the Beit Benghazi Committee established specifically for this purpose. \u2022 The \"Armed Walk\" programme known as \"Acceleration and Rage,\" in which the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, in part during Obama's presidency, allowed the sale of weapons to Mexican citizens in the hope of tracking down drug ring leaders. The programme was investigated jointly by the Committee for the Oversight of the House of Representatives, the Reform of the Government and the Judicial Committee of the Senate. In most cases, the Obama Administration has handed over documents requested by legislators. On January 13, 2021, bloggers announced the extraordinary truth-checking story in which General David H. Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for marine security, telling her that we were \"not working for you.\" For example, the Solendra investigation looked at 300,000 documents, the IRS investigation looked at 1.3 million, the Benghazi probe looked at hundreds of thousands, and looked quickly and angry at more than 10,000 documents. It should be noted that the Obama Administration did not hand over documents intentionally. At times, the Department opposed the delivery of documents. This was the case in the investigations carried out on Solandra, on speed and anger, and on Benghazi. However, the lack of cooperation was generally abolished in the courts, and the Department eventually handed over the documents. \"Some documents have been withheld and the administration cited specific reasons for withholding them,\" said Eric Schickler, a politician from the University of California-Berkeley who co-authored the book \"President's Investigations: Congressional Checks on Presidential Power.\" \"I cannot say whether those reasons are 'good' or not, but they have not been blocked by blanket or sentence.\" Douglas Creiner, the co-author of Schickler and a government professor at Cornell University, said that the dynamic of pressure on documents between executive and legislative branches is as old as the Republic, dating back to the investigation of a military disaster at the Ohio border under the leadership of President George Washington. Krenner said: \"The Obama administration's precedents are therefore consistent with previous practice.\" \"Any attempt to mention it to justify widespread non-compliance with recent requests for documents from the White House is deception.\" What are the differences? However, the comparison between the Obama and Tramp administrations is not quite apple apples. We are not aware of any investigations into Obama's personal finances, as is the case with Trump. (Obama &apos; s commercial and real estate properties were insignificant compared to Trump &apos; s. The four investigations described above tend to focus on the activities of the executive branch agencies rather than the White House itself. \"I don't know about any major investigations from the Obama White House itself,\" said Charles Tever, a professor of law from Baltimore University, who previously served as an attorney and deputy general counsel for the United States House of Representatives. When Elise J. Penn, a professor of law in Wayne State, served on the Senate Standing Subcommittee of Inquiry from 1999 to 2014 - a period that partly overlapped with Obama's presidency - she never mentioned that she had sent a letter requesting a document to the White House. On the contrary, \"we have sent many requests for documents to agencies such as the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of Currency, the Ministry of Health and Human Services, and the Ministry of Internal Security.\" The White House in Trump did not respond to a query about this article. Our Governor Trump said that when Congress sought documents from Obama, the White House \"didn't do anything. They did not give a single letter of request. Several requests were made. They didn't give a message.\" That's not what happened. The Obama administration has given hundreds of thousands of documents to Congress in at least four investigations. For a small part of these documents, the administration went to the court to try to bypass the request, but the courts generally stand by Congress, and the documents were eventually handed over. The experts say that the scenario is typical of a long-term skirmish between the executive and legislative branches. The documents received were mostly those of the executive branch agencies, not those of the White House. This is largely due to the fact that questions have never been raised about Obama's personal finances. - So we evaluate it with pants on fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00919"}
