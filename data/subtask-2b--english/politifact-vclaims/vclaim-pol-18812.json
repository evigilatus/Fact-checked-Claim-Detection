His campaign said the plan would be funded in part by eliminating a tax policy called \"stepped-up basis\" that reduces inheritance taxes.\nStepped-up basis provides a big benefit to those who inherit certain assets, including real estate. It means that the person who inherited the asset only has to pay tax on its gains in value beginning from the time it was inherited, rather than from the time it was originally purchased, according to the nonprofit Tax Policy Center.\u00a0\nThe difference in tax liability can be significant, the Tax Policy Center points out, and Facebook users noted the same thing.\nOne Oct. 25 Facebook post says, \"Did you know Biden wants to get rid of something called \u2018stepped up basis\u2019??? How does this affect you! When your parents pass and leave you the family house normally you would inherit that property at what it is worth today. If you were to sell that house you would only pay taxes on the gain from what it is worth today and what it sells for. If Biden does away with \u2018stepped up basis\u2019 you will inherit the property for what your parents paid for the property. If you decide to sell you will pay taxes on the difference between the original purchase price and what it sells for today.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

The issue came up again in June, when Biden told donors at a fundraising event that he intends to roll back Trump\u2019s tax cuts and \"close loopholes like capital gains and stepped-up basis,\" according to CNBC.\u00a0\nStepped-up basis takes its name from the \"step up\" to fair market value that happens when a person inherits certain assets. The basis \u2014 which is another way of saying the original purchase price, plus improvements, minus depreciation \u2014 adjusts to current fair market value at the time it is bequeathed.\u00a0\nIf the asset is sold after it\u2019s inherited, then the stepped-up value is the base that gains are measured against for taxes. Any gains in value from the time of original purchase to the time the asset is \"stepped up\" to market value when inherited are not taxed.\u00a0\nThe policy has been part of the U.S. tax code since 1921, according to The Hill, which reports that its origins are unclear but likely related to the difficulty in determining the original price of assets at that time. Biden has said he wants to eliminate the policy, and if he is elected, he can propose changes to tax law, but only Congress can enact tax laws.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post claims that Biden wants to get rid of stepped-up basis, a tax policy that allows people inheriting and selling certain assets to only pay tax on the increase in value from the time it was inherited, rather than on the gains in value from the time it was originally purchased.\nBiden and his campaign have said that he wants to eliminate stepped-up basis. His campaign says the increased tax revenue would be used to help fund Biden\u2019s plan for free community college. We rate this claim True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18812"}
