  "vclaim": "A young man with a blind date arranged for later in the evening stops by a drug store one afternoon to pick up some condoms (just in case).  To cover his nervousness, he jokes with the pharmacist about how he plans to \u201cget lucky\u201d that night.  When the young man arrives at his date\u2019s home later that evening the door is answered by the same pharmacist, who turns out to be his blind date\u2019s father."
