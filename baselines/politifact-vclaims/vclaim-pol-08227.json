Those cuts, combined with falling local property tax collections, have forced school districts to reduce staff, increase class sizes, furlough employees and shorten their school years.\nChances ramped up for education to be a hot topic in the Republican primary as well, with State School Superintendent John Barge in the mix of announced GOP challengers to incumbent Gov. Nathan Deal.\nWe started our truth test of Carter\u2019s statement by asking for the source of his information. A spokeswoman referred us to a November report published by the left-leaning Georgia Budget & Policy Institute.\nThe report was based on an online survey taken over the summer. Of the state\u2019s 180 school districts, 140 -- representing 92.8 percent of all public schools -- participated, according to the GBPI.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong the findings: The surveyed districts now have 8,982 fewer teachers in their classrooms than they did in 2009.\nWe checked in with the state\u2019s two major teacher groups -- the Professional Association of Georgia Educators and the Georgia Association of Educators. The data developed by the GBPI and cited by Carter seems \"credible to me,\" PAGE spokesman Tim Callahan said.\nAdded GAE President Calvine Rollins: \"What we do know is that class sizes have increased tremendously.\"\nWe compared the GBPI information against data that districts are required to submit annually to the state.The results were very similar.\nIn fiscal 2009, which covers the 2008-2009 school year, Georgia had 120,660 teachers in pre-kindergarten through 12th grade -- 115,277 full-time and 5,383 part-time -- according to the annual state report card on education.\nThat compares with 111,401 public school teachers -- 107,729 full-time and 3,672 part-time -- working in fiscal 2013, or the 2012-2013 school year. And the difference is 9,259 fewer teachers statewide.\nAs to the claim by Carter, that school enrollment rose in this period, state data show he\u2019s correct.\nStudent enrollment wasn\u2019t growing rapidly but it did increase. There were 1,615,066 students in Georgia public schools in fiscal 2009 and 1,657,506 in attendance in fiscal 2013, according to state data.\nOn Oct. 1, the 180 districts collectively counted and reported to the state Department of Education that they had 1,723,439 students on their rolls.\nCarter\u2019s statement was based on solid \u00a0numbers. Georgia has lost about 7.6 percent of its teachers since 2009. Enrollment wasn\u2019t booming, but it did grow by about 2.6 percent.\nWe rate his statement as True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08227"}
