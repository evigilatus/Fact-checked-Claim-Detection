But Stein is more right than even he thinks, in part because he inadvertently used the word \"beta\"\u00a0 to describe the specific website testing. In the IT world, there are many kinds of tests under many kinds of names.\nPut another way, Stein goofed -- but by goofing, he got closer to the truth.\nHere\u2019s what you need to know.\nThe Examiner story, quoting someone speaking anonymously, said officials did not allow testing on the website until just days before it went live Oct. 1. The biggest problem, according to this report and others, was that leaders of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services decided to act as the central coordinator for the project (CMS would not tell the Examiner if the agency holds that role).\nThe next day, the Washington Post described how government officials and contractors proceeded with the rollout despite a botched crucial test days earlier. They ran a simulation, unsuccessfully, in which a few hundred people tried to log onto the website at the same time. The failure proved an early warning of the bumpy road to come. Officials went forward with the launch, and the website \"locked up\" almost immediately when 2,000 users tried step one, the Post reported.\nUnnamed sources told the Post that an end-to-end trial run of the process did not happen by as late as Sept. 26, the week before the launch.\n(Here at PolitiFact we don't rely on unnamed sources, but the reports from the Examiner and the Post appear credible.)\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHogan Gidley\n\n\nstated on January 17, 2021 in a Fox News interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump \u201ccan\u2019t say anything (about the U.S. Capitol riot) because the platforms have removed him.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 18, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Beta testing\" is a very specific term in the tech world that most professional software goes through before launching. It comes after a product is in an \"alpha\" phase, or the earliest version of software that is subject to some tests to find any big issues. When a product reaches beta, it is tested by a larger group of people not connected to its development in an effort to gather feedback and make more fixes before a large-scale launch.\nBig tech companies like Google sometimes launch products in beta mode, but enterprise and government software vendors don\u2019t usually do it that way, said Alexander Howard, former Washington correspondent for tech-centric O\u2019Reilly Media and a fellow at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University. They stop adding features in the months preceding a launch to \"start testing the heck out of it,\" Howard said.\nThe development of healthcare.gov has been an entirely different story, he said, with no use of those terms.\n\"The only thing we have is reporting that says the first testing occurred the last week before it went live, and then it went live,\" Howard said. \"There was testing, but it\u2019s not clear that it was in a beta version.\"\nAccording to published reports, healthcare.gov got additional features quite close to the launch, with no evidence of a consumer-centric test that went outside of the government. So Stein might have inartfully used the word beta-testing, but he might also have a point.\n\"Even if those tests nominally did occur, they were as good as nonexistent based on the complexity of the project,\" said Patrick Ruffini, a Republican digital strategist.\nTesting of any kind was difficult because the specifications for the website were evolving the month before the website went up, said Gail Wilensky, senior fellow at Project Hope and former Medicare director under former President George H. W. Bush.\nThe Post story, by the way, said a test group of 10 insurers that had access to the site advised the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services that the site was not ready to launch nationwide. Insurers have been in \"regular communication\" with government officials and contractors to test the back end of the site dealing with enrollment, Robert Zirkelbach, spokesman for the industry group America's Health Insurance Plans, told us.\nBut most people are getting hung up on the earliest steps of setting up an account and verifying who they are.\nWe reached out to CMS and CGI Federal, one of the main contractors for the website, but did not hear back. (We suspect they\u2019re busy.)\nOur ruling\nHere\u2019s what Stein said: \"No one beta-tested\" healthcare.gov.\nStein, in fact, meant to say something else, he told us. But at PolitiFact we check the statements as they are made.\nIn this case, Stein is closer to the truth than maybe even he thought.\nStein specifically referred to beta testing on MSNBC, which is a phrase that traditionally means certain members of the public were allowed to access the website well before it opened. There's no evidence to suggest that happened, and the federal government isn't talking.\nUltimately, this is a glitch of a statement talking about the glitches of a website.\nBut it rates Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08719"}
