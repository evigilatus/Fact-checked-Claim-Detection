An online ad repeatedly shows Kerbello in a television interview that says, \"If anyone has a complaint, file it,\" while the ad lists a series of attacks on Corbello. (This quote has nothing to do with medical care and concerns a case involving Corbello's work as a stressor.) When Corbello supported the termination of the medical care guarantee? Corbello: \"If anyone has a complaint, bring it.\" Here we're going to check whether Corbello \"supports the termination of the medical care guarantee\" -- an attack that might draw the attention of major voters in the province that extends to Miami to Key West. \u2219 Paul Ryan's proposals on medical care do not give any explanation as to what it means to end the medical care guarantee or why Garcia claims that this is the view of Corbello. Corbello is a member of the board of directors of the Miami-Dade School, who has never served in Congress before, so he has not voted on any medical care plan. The Garcia attack relates to the Corbello statement of April 2014 on the GOP budget plan by the United States Republic of America, Paul Ryan, Speaker of the Ryan House of Representatives, which included proposals to reform the medical care system in the previous few budget proposals with some changes along the way. When I asked the Miami Herald Corbello newspaper in April whether it supported Ryan's plan in response to the attack by the Congressional Democratic Campaign Committee, Corbello said: \"I will vote for any budget that helps create jobs and reward hard work, protect medical care for the elderly, and stop the immoral accumulation of debt on my generation and on my daughter's generation. While I haven't completely reviewed this budget, I tend to support it.\" So what did the DEA mean by ending the medical care guarantee? The explanation of how medical care is a guarantee that once she is 65 years old, she receives medical care, not questions asked. This has been the case since the establishment of the medical care system in 1965. Medical care has been classified as a defined benefit plan rather than a defined contribution plan. This means that it determines the benefits provided, rather than leaving the benefits dependent on the amount of money paid in the system. But the federal government does not guarantee that it will pay for every possible service or treatment -- Midejab's insurance plans have emerged to pay for actions not covered by medical care. Congress and the President can change what is covered by medical care. The Affordable Care Act introduces changes in the medical care system to reduce future growth of the programme. Ryan has issued several copies of his medical care plan in the last few years. The plan issued by Ryan this year calls for the reform of medical care in the pre-retirement support programme, where, starting in 2024, every new beneficiary will enter into the premium support system, but they will be able to choose whether their premium support payments go to help pay for a special plan or a traditional fee-for-service scheme. (Criticism refers to this as a coupon plan, and has some similarities.) A spokesman for Ryan said that the payment of support premiums would be linked to the average bid. For those aged 55 or over in 2013, they will remain in the traditional medical care system. Ryan also raises eligibility from 65 to 67 years of age. Ryan &apos; s proposal to reform the medical care system did not go far because it lacked support in the Democrat-controlled Senate. The phrase \"the guarantee of medical care,\" which simply states that Ryan's plan \"the termination of the guarantee of medical care\" is a misleading exaggeration. Carl Ruff mentioned in an interview with Fox News on December 22, 2009, \"In Florida, Sun. Bill Nelson... got $25 billion to $30 billion.\" If we simply talk about \"Medicare's guarantee\" to older persons of access to medical care when they reach a certain age, they are still guaranteed. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology Economics (MITE) said Jonathan Gruber, who advised Republicans Met Romney and President Barack Obama on health care issues. Michael Tanner, a health-care expert at the Liberal Cato Institute, said that Ryan's medical-care plan \"would be a smaller benefit, but it still benefits everyone. While it would be a smaller benefit, President Obama would also benefit from it.\" Some of the medical care experts we interviewed argued that it was unclear what types of services would remain assured. Jonathan Oberlander, Professor of Health Policy at North Carolina University, said: \"Ryan's plan continues to change, lacks key details, has multiple dimensions, making it difficult to assess it.\" Today, medical care has a range of services that include a number of days in a hospital or nursing home and cover specific tests and procedures. Henry J. Aaron, a senior colleague at the Brookings Institute, said: \"What can be covered under an insurance scheme may be purchased by people with vouchers not specified in the law.\" \"The vouchers can be eroded over time if they do not increase as fast as medical costs, a standard feature of many voucher plans, unless people pay additional premiums that may increase rapidly if they want to maintain a wider coverage.\" At this stage, Ryan's plan leaves lawyers asking questions. \"I do not know for sure whether there are guaranteed basic benefits or whether the benefits now secured should be in those plans,\" said Judith Stein, Executive Director of the Medical Advocacy Centre. \"It's gonna be so different.\" What Corbello's saying about Corbello tells Polity Fucking Florida that he's against a coupon plan or medical support. Corbello said, \"I never supported the concept of a coupon.\" \"I don't think we need to do this. I think we can maintain medical care as it exists today through other reforms.\" Corbello called for \"the elimination of pervasive fee-for-service fraud, the adjustment of the age of eligibility for the calculation of longevity, and possibly the test,\" and the campaign spokesman said Gait\u00e1n Politi Fact Florida. However, Corbello does not deny that he said that he supported Ryan &apos; s overall budget proposal, although he told Polyte Fact Florida that he did not approve the premium support plan under it. \"With a choice between the GOP budget and the Democrat budget, he would have supported the GOP budget,\" said Gaitan. A Republican charge of wanting to get rid of the Medicary Guarantee is a common democratic tactic this year -- in fact, Garcia's attack on Corbello is similar to that in April by the Campaign Committee of the Democratic Congress. (The CTC used a similar attack on the U.S. Republic of Steve Southerland, R-Fla, used by the Senate Democratic Campaign Committee against Senator Johnny Ernest in Iowa. This democratic talking point is the last difference on the democratic line that the Republicans voted to end medical care. Our referee, Garcia, said that Corbello supported the termination of the medical care guarantee. The Democrats attach this allegation to a very weak thread: when asked about Ryan's budget proposal, which includes reform of the Corbello medical care system, he said: \"When I did not fully review this budget, I tend to support it.\" This statement does not shed light on Corbello &apos; s views on changing medical care. Ryan &apos; s plan would change medical care but would not end the guarantee that older persons would receive it when they reached a certain age. Corbello says he wants to reform medical care in other ways that do not involve Ryan's excellent support plan. We value this allegation wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07333"}
