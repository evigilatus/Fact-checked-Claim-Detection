Andrew Como was the source of many differences between supporters and opponents of the law and drew the attention of President Donald Trump, who criticized him during his State of the Union address. Michael Long, head of the New York State Conservative Party, criticized the new law during an interview with the radio host John Katsimattis, saying he went too far. \"They have removed all criminal sanctions from him,\" said Long. \"A woman can give birth to a child and, after that, have a discussion with a doctor, if the child is born alive, It's a very sad comment.\" We looked into Long's claim that \"if the child is born alive, they will let the child expire.\" In an interview, Long said that he was sure that the law did not make it clear that the children would be left to die. However, since the law allowed abortion later in pregnancy, he wondered what would happen to children born alive. We referred Long to Kathleen Gallagher, Director of Life Advocacy Activities at the New York State Catholic Conference, for details. Gallagher said that the new law abolished part of the State Public Health Act. The cancelled part states that more than 20 weeks of abortions must be attended by the second doctor \"to control and provide immediate medical care for any live birth as a result of the abortion\" The repealed part also states that \"it should be granted immediate legal protection under the laws of the State of New York, including, but not limited to, the applicable provisions of the Social Services Act, section V of the Civil Rights Act and the Penal Code.\" A representative of the National Right to Life, an organization that puts pressure on abortion, also took note of the repealed articles of the Public Health Act. Jennifer Bobick, director of the organization &apos; s federal legislation, wrote in an e-mail that since New York law allows medical professionals licensed by non-doctors to perform abortions, a person qualified to care for a child may not be present if a child is born alive. We also referred Bobick to data from the Centers for Disease Control from 2003 to 14. This data from selected states showed that 143 children were born alive after the \"output.\" This figure can be underestimated, according to the CDC. The data do not reflect the full conditions of their deaths, but researchers noted that in 97 of these cases there were complications in the health of the mother or one or more congenital abnormalities. We asked one of the sponsors of the new law, Mr. Sen. Liz Krueger, if children born alive during an abortion would leave \"ending,\" as Long said. The spokesman for Krueger, Justin Flag, wrote in an e-mail that \"RHA does not change the standards of medical practice. Any child born alive in the state of New York is treated like any other live birth, and appropriate medical care is given. This was the case before RHA, and it's still the case now.\" \"A provider who has improperly abandoned or neglected the patient violates the laws of professional misconduct and is subject to substantial penalties including loss of his medical license, fines, as well as possible civil and criminal liability,\" said Hazel Krampton-Hayes, spokesman for Komo. The Reproductive Health Act doesn't change anything. Colin Schmidt mentioned on January 14, 2021 at a press conference \"We have scientific data, from all different levels, but especially from high school sports levels, from many different states that show that it's safe to play what New York thinks of high-risk sports.\" The Protection of Living Births Act 2002 provides that any person born alive under any circumstances enjoys full rights as any other person. Dr. Vanessa Barnaby, Head of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Department, Jacobs College of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, University of Buffalo, said she understood how the law could lead some people to believe that children born alive would be left to die, but said that that was not what was happening in practice. Barnaby said that pregnancies are sometimes terminated to save a mother's life, but that does not necessarily mean that the child will not survive. According to her experience, the standard of care is the recovery of children born after 24 weeks, when they are considered viable. Abortion later in Chapter II or Chapter III is complex and requires high training from practitioners. Because of this, they are usually performed in hospitals, which employ other providers capable of caring for any child born alive, as she said. She said that children born with severe problems would not recover if that was the wish of the parents. This standard of care for children born alive upon termination of pregnancy existed prior to the enactment of the law, according to the sponsor of the bill. We have placed family planning in New York City in contact with a member of its board of directors, Dr. Stephen Chesen, a professor of clinical obstetrics and gynaecology at Will Cornell Medical College. Chesen said that Long's statement fakes what the Reproductive Health Authority does and describes a situation that is not an abortion. \"It's about the model of hospital care that patients and their doctor have decided is the best course of action, using the best medicines available, not the pursuit of something useless,\" he said. \"It's not killing children. It's not indifference. It has nothing to do with abortion. He said that care in a care home and care in a care home could apply to a range of cases.\" Governor Long, head of the State Conservative Party, said that under the new law, children born alive would be able to leave \"ending.\" The state law abolished some forms of protection for children in these circumstances, but this part of the law was redundant, and under federal and state law, children born alive are entitled to the same medical care and protection as any other person. In cases where the hospital care approach is followed for children born at a very early age during pregnancy or suffering from fatal deformities, this approach predates the new law, which is an acceptable standard of care. We also appreciate the best of the wrong Long.
