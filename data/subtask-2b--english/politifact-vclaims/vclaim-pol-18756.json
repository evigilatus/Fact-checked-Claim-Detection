Tom Wolf.\u00a0\nTrump told his supporters that Pennsylvania \"never reopened\" after Wolf ordered the shutdown of \"non-life-sustaining businesses\" in March, soon after the outset of the pandemic.\n\"What the hell is going on with your state?\" Trump said. \"You guys never opened.\"\u00a0\nDay-to-day life in Pennsylvania hasn\u2019t returned to normal, and it may not until a coronavirus vaccine is widely available. But the state\u2019s schools and businesses aren\u2019t uniformly shuttered as they were in the spring.\u00a0\nAll 67 Pennsylvania counties are in the \"green\" phase of the Wolf administration's three-phase reopening plan and have been since July 3, meaning most businesses may operate at 75% capacity, and school districts may decide whether to offer in-person instruction. Lebanon County, east of Harrisburg, was the last county to move from \"yellow\" to \"green.\"\u00a0\nPennsylvania\u2019s lockdown began on March 19, when Wolf ordered all non-life-sustaining businesses to close to help stop the spread of the virus. Two weeks later, Wolf issued a statewide stay-at-home order, and one week after that, he announced that schools would remain closed through the end of the academic year.\u00a0\nAt that point, all counties were in the \"red\" phase, with severe restrictions imposed by Wolf.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn mid-April, the governor announced the criteria for counties to reopen \u2014 fewer than 50 new confirmed cases per 100,000 residents reported to the state in the previous 14 days. He said the state would also assess whether a county had enough testing and contact tracing, and he set May 8 as a target date to begin lifting restrictions.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPat Toomey\n\n\nstated on January 19, 2021 in a hearing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere will be several thousand dollars in payments going to families with six-figure incomes who\u2019ve had no income interruption whatsoever.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jessica Calefati \u2022 January 21, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe followed through.\u00a0\nThat day, 24 counties moved from \"red\" to the \"yellow\" phase of reopening, and over the next two months, all counties moved into \"yellow\" and eventually to \"green,\" the least restrictive phase.\u00a0\nNow that all Pennsylvania counties are in \"green,\" it has been up to each of the state\u2019s 500 school districts to determine whether or not to offer in-person instruction. Philadelphia will welcome some students back to classrooms on Nov. 30, and Pittsburgh plans to reopen on Nov. 9. Students in the Central Bucks district returned on Sept. 30.\u00a0\nAll Pennsylvania counties have remained in the \"green\" phase even as case counts have climbed to the highest level since April, and Pennsylvania Secretary of Health Rachel Levine said as recently as Oct. 14 that the state has no plan to impose any new restrictions.\u00a0\n\"We're in a much better place than we were in the spring,\" Levine said.\nBesides, whether Wolf has the power to impose another lockdown remains unsettled. In September, a federal judge\u00a0struck down key elements\u00a0of the governor\u2019s virus mitigation strategy, labeling the limits he imposed on businesses and gatherings unconstitutional. The state appealed the ruling, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit agreed to\u00a0restore the restrictions on gatherings\u00a0until it rules on Wolf\u2019s petition for relief.\nThe state\u2019s COVID-19 dashboard, which displays real-time data on confirmed cases of the virus, shows that Philadelphia, Delaware, Berks and Centre counties all have more than 2,000 cases per 100,000 residents, well above the threshold the state deems safe. Two dozen other counties have more than 1,000 cases per 100,000 residents.\u00a0\nBut so far, Wolf has not imposed any new restrictions.\u00a0\nOur ruling\u00a0\nTrump said Pennsylvania \"never opened.\" That\u2019s not true. Most businesses were closed and residents were ordered to stay home in April, but restrictions have been lifted gradually since May, and no new lockdowns have been ordered even as case counts climb. Trump\u2019s statement is inaccurate. We rate it False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18756"}
