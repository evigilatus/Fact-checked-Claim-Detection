After the mass shooting in El Paso, the Mart and Dayton, Ohio, the entertainment area left 31 dead, the leaders of Wisconsin raised questions about \"snakes\" in state law. In August 2019, democratic legislators enacted legislation requiring verification of the background of almost all arms sales. (Joff) Tony Evers, a democratic colleague, threatened to convene a special session on this issue if Republican legislative leaders did not accept the bill. This figure indicates that 80 per cent of state residents support comprehensive background checks - including 75 per cent of weapons owners - according to Paul from the Faculty of Law of the University of Marquette, which took place in mid-August. So how is that different from Wisconsin now? An example was given by the Democratic Attorney-General of the State. \"Because we do not have a comprehensive background check, people who pose a threat to others - including those convicted of a serious crime or subject to a restraining order on domestic violence - can currently buy a firearm without a background check,\" Josh Cole said in tweet 15, 2019. Jennifer Shelling, D-LaCrosse, raised the same point with a tweet earlier that day. Can someone in these circumstances buy a weapon without checking their background? Most arms buyers undergo background checks. A convicted criminal, or a person with an active restraining order relating to domestic violence, does not undergo criminal background checks to qualify for a firearm. The Federal Act requires such inquiries into the background of any purchase of a firearm from a federal firearms licence dealer - which includes any retailers or other persons involved in the sale of firearms as a profession. In Wisconsin, the State Department of Justice carries out background checks on gun sales, while long arms sales pass through national criminal background verification systems, This two-pronged system covers the \"great majority\" of firearms purchases in the state, Cole said in August 9, 2019, to appear on Wisconsin public television \"here and now.\" Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" \u2022 January 26, 2021, this is the process that defenders refer to when they observe the existence of background checks. But it's not the only way to buy a gun. A study conducted in 2015 showed that 22 per cent of arms owners purchased their latest firearms without a background check. This is because arms sales in Wisconsin among private parties (who do not hold a federal firearms licence) are not subject to reporting, waiting period or background verification requirements. The American Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives does not regulate private sales and private sales involving traders. Wisconsin is one of the 29 states which, according to the Giffords Legal Centre for the Prevention of Armed Violence, also has no state regulation, the Research and Advocacy Organization, which seeks \"laws, policies and programmes that have proven to save lives from armed violence.\" Websites such as Arminleste - a Craigslist-style firearms market - link private vendors and use them extensively. A search in September 2019 showed over 2,000 firearms for sale from private parties in Wisconsin. Two guns used in the famous shooting here were purchased through the weapons list by people ordered by the court. In October 2012, Radcliffe Hutton killed three people, including his separated wife, and wounded four others, before killing himself in Azana Salon and Spa in Brookfield. One day before the shooting, he bought a 40-caliber pistol in the parking lot in the German city of McDonalds after contacting the seller on the weapons list. Two days earlier, a judge issued a restraining order prohibiting Hutton from possessing a weapon. In January 2018, Robert Schmidt purchased a 9mm Glock from a 19-year-old man through the weapons list, days after he was released from Kalumit District Prison in Sindh to prevent him from acquiring a weapon. The deal was made in a parking lot in Wal-Mart. Schmidt was then charged with raping his wife at gunpoint. The next night he used that gun to kill his wife and then himself in a house outside Appleton. Our judgment, Cole, said that criminals and people subject to restraining orders for domestic abuse can currently buy weapons in Wisconsin. All purchases of firearms dealers are subject to the requirements of the states and the Federation, which include criminal background checks. But Cole is right that Wisconsin is among the states without control over arms sales between private parties. This allowed people in the circumstances he described as buying weapons, with tragic consequences in some cases. We're assessing this claim right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00163"}
