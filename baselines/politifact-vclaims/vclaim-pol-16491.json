There's no evidence that Romney spoke up or took action against those cities.\n\n\nBut Romney's inaction does not necessarily confirm the Giuliani campaign's larger point \u2013- that Romney was soft on illegal immigration.\n\n\nLate in his term, Romney approved a plan to deputize state troopers to help enforce immigration laws, although the plan was not implemented because it was rescinded by his successor, Gov. Deval Patrick.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H.
