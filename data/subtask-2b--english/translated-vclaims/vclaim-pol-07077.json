The Republic of Kentucky was the president of the October 15th race in Ashland Dave Pratt, the candidate of the Republican Party for the seventh congressional seat in the province. Paul, the favorite tea party, said NIH has money to waste. \"Do you know what the National Institute of Health spends money?\" He asked the crowd. Paul included a series of national health projects that he considered tacky. He said that \"US$ 2.4 million was spent by the National Health Federation on the condom \"Origami.\" \"This is a family gathering, so I'm not going into what that means.\" But we will. We wondered whether his claim was correct. The origami is Japanese art in folding paper to form animals, flowers and other designs, according to the new Webster dictionary of the World College. We struggled to imagine how this centuries-old trade could improve condoms. The Office of Paul supported the statement of the Senator by sending us several articles on the financing of the National Institute of Health for condom research, the first to be published by the Free Washington newspaper in March this year. It turns out that there is a company in California called ORIGAMI, which vows to reinvent condoms, and it is a contraception that many men do not like. The company believes that the popularity of condoms - which must be open and usually made of latex - would be much better if they were more satisfactory, less difficult and safer to use. Oregami's developing a condom with sheets like accordion. It is made of silicone, and because it is unusable and has not to be dismantled, it can be developed more quickly than traditional condoms. The company is seeking FDA approval and hopes to sell its products next year. A number of global health organizations are promoting condom research and development, convinced that increased use of devices will lead to fewer unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases, such as control. Since 2006, the Institute has made seven grants totalling approximately $2.5 million to assist in the development of the ORIGAMI male and female condoms. These funds were provided to a variety of Strata, a product design company headed by Danny Resnick, founder of ORIGAMI. The Resnick case is included in the grant documents as the project leader in the research. Check the facts (Kirk Cox) was mentioned on January 13, 2021 in a speech. Virginia ranked lowest third of the states in the management of the COVID-19 vaccine. \u2022 On 20 January 2021, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation commended the work of ORIGAMI, which last year provided $1.1 million in grants to other employers seeking to improve condoms. The Foundation said that Oregami provided an excellent example of a special project focusing on the design of the new condom to promote consistent use by emphasizing sexual experience. Let us now return to Paul's speech. In regretting the use of public funds for the development of \"the protective origami,\" the Senator never determined the difference between paper art and the name of the company. We asked Brian Darling, Paul's spokesman, whether his boss refers to Oregami with capital \"O,\" means the company, or a small \"O,\" which means the artistic form. \"The senator's words speak for themselves,\" Darling responded in the e-mail. \"I don't understand the confusion.\" On the day before his appearance in Ashland, Paul spells the origami with a small \"S\" in Facebook and tweets to fake NIH spending. \"The National Institute of Public Health blames the federal budget's emphasis on its inability to produce #Ebolavacine, but somehow found $2.4 million to develop the 'Origami' condom designed with a Japanese folding paper,\" Paul wrote on his Facebook page. He wrote on Twitter: \"@NIH cannot afford an Ebola BC vaccine of \"budget cuts,\" but it can spend $2.4 million to develop a condom \"origami\" #Priorities http://www.daylymail.co.uk/news/article-.\" What would the company say about all this? Mark Bardwell, spokesperson for ORIGAMI, defended the grants, saying that they were given \"on the basis of scientific merit.\" \"Territories are a medical device. In this way, the FDA safety test standards must be passed through expensive clinical trials,\" Bardwell said. \"Innovative condoms may take three to four years and several million dollars for research, development and human testing.\" In our attempt to document the waste at the National Institute of Health, Paul said that the health agency spent $2.4 million on the condom \"origami.\" Paul did not provide more information in his speech, leaving the public wondering whether tax dollars went to develop paper condoms folded into fancy forms. What he did not say was that Origami was the name of a company that received grants from the National Institute of Health for the development of improved silicon condoms containing folds. The National Institute of Health has long promoted the use of condoms to reduce unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases. But we do not find a major flaw in Paul. In its own name, the company proposes the origami principles that lead its design. Therefore, we appreciate that Paul's claim is true for the most part.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07077"}
