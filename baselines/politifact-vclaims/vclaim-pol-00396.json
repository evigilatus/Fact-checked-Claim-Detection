Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\nThe headline: \"Ocasio-Cortez Proposes Nationwide Motorcycle Ban.\"\nNo, Ocasio-Cortez is not coming for motorcyclists. The story, and quotes within, are made up.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe post, which has nearly 700 comments and over 6,200 shares, was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined. Any similarities between this site\u2019s pure fantasy and actual people, places, and events are purely coincidental and all images should be considered altered and satirical.\"\u00a0\nStill, the Facebook post garnered comments that thought it was real: \"Just think. She\u2019s going to have a Great Pension for the rest of her life & Medical. For being STUPID.\" Also: \"Back off!!! A good majority of motorcyclists are retired veterans.
