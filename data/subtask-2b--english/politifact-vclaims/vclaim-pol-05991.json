The viral image said:\nUnions did not create:\n--Weekends\n--8-hour work days\n--A \"living wage\" (doubled worker's pay from $2.34/hr to $5/hr)\n--Five-day, 40-hour work weeks\nHenry Ford did in 1926 to attract better workers from his competitors for his automobile plant. Capitalism & competition creates higher wages & better working conditions. #HappyLaborDay.\nWe wondered whether it was correct that Henry Ford, rather than unions, should get credit for creating the eight-hour work day and the 40-hour work week.\nA long struggle\nIn the United States, a few limited eight-hour-day laws were on the books shortly after the Civil War. One, in Illinois, was passed in 1867, followed in 1868 by a law covering certain classes of federal workers. But neither law was well-enforced, and in most sectors, working hours of 10 to 12 hours were common. So a reduction in the work week became a leading issue for the nascent labor movement.\nThe issue came to a head in 1884, after the Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions -- a predecessor of today\u2019s AFL-CIO -- called for all workers to have eight-hour days by May 1, 1886. When that deadline wasn\u2019t met, labor leaders upped the ante by calling for demonstrations. In Chicago, peaceful marches morphed into violence, with an explosion marring a rally at Haymarket Square on May 4, 1886, leaving seven police officers and four workers dead. Subsequent trials, executions and clemencies for the accused made the eight-hour week a top issue nationally and internationally.\nAll of this occurred decades before Ford founded his company in 1903.\nFord\u2019s move\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1914, at a time when most workers still lacked a guarantee of eight-hour days, the Ford Motor Co. attracted notice for instituting eight-hour shifts and raising wages in the manner the graphic indicates. (For many Ford workers, the work week remained six days.)\nThe company\u2019s move -- made a dozen years earlier than the graphic said -- was significant, labor historians say. But they add that it\u2019s worth noting some caveats. For instance, Ford\u2019s \" \u2018sociological department\u2019 had to inspect a worker\u2019s home to make sure they \u2018deserved\u2019 the $5 first,\" said Ileen A. DeVault, a professor of labor relations, law and history at Cornell University.\nIn addition, Ford\u2019s policy wasn\u2019t law, so it wasn\u2019t guaranteed to last indefinitely, even for those who qualified for it.\n\"It was a unilaterally provided benefit at the discretion of the employer and could be yanked away whenever the cost exceeded profits,\" said Robert Bruno, a professor with the University of Illinois School of Labor and Employment Relations. Companies that operated this way, Bruno said, often revoked these policies when the Great Depression hit.\nThe endgame\nFord\u2019s initiative was not widely copied overnight. In 1916, the federal government passed an act to require an eight-hour day and overtime pay for railroad workers, but most workers still didn\u2019t have those protections, and working hours remained a hotly contested issue. \"Demands for the five-day week began to proliferate in 1919, a year in which 4 million American\u00a0workers went out on strike,\" said Priscilla Murolo, a professor of history at Sarah Lawrence College. \"That was about 20 percent of the industrial labor force.\"\nIt took President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s signing of the Fair Labor Standards Act in 1938 for all workers to see limits on working hours -- initially 44 hours a week, then phased to 42 and eventually 40 by 1940. \"When the FLSA was passed in 1938, Saturday working hours were still common,\" DeVault said. \"Saturday noon was the most frequent \u2018payday\u2019 time.\"\nGiven this history, Ford is best described as an early adopter of today\u2019s familiar working hours, experts said.\n\"That happened more than 60 years after workers, through their unions, began organizing for an eight-hour day in the 1860s,\" said David Bensman, a professor at Rutgers University's School of Management and Labor Relations. \"When Ford adopted the eight-hour day for his factory, he was responding to a working force that had been demanding the eight-hour day for a long time.\"\nOther experts agreed that labor unions, rather than Ford, deserve the primary credit for today\u2019s working-hour schedule -- including Matt Anderson, curator of transportation at the Henry Ford museum in Dearborn, Mich.\n\"Henry Ford was an early proponent of the five-day week, but the American Federation of Labor fought for it to be adopted more widely via contract negotiations,\" Anderson said. \"Unions absolutely deserve much credit for the reform.\"\nOur ruling\nA viral image said that Henry Ford, not unions, created the eight-hour work day and the five-day work week.\nFord does deserve credit for adopting shorter working shifts, but he was hardly the first employer to do this, and the now-standard working schedule did not become federal law -- and thus a right for all workers -- until almost a quarter-century after Ford\u2019s move. Meanwhile, experts said, unions do deserve credit for keeping the working-hours issue alive, at significant personal sacrifice, for 70 years.\nThe claim contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05991"}
