County Clerk Kathy Nickolaus, a Republican in a GOP stronghold, didn\u2019t report her error for more than a day after the election.\n\nGiven the outrage over the Waukesha incident, Kloppenburg seems on solid ground suggesting that there are \"widespread questions\" about the election.\n\nBut are there \"widespread anomalies\" in the statewide count?\n\nThat\u2019s a much different claim and one we can check.\n\nIn order to justify her claim, we think Kloppenburg has to show that numerous questionable situations remain that are \"irregular\" or \"abnormal\" -- a dictionary definition of \"anomalous.\"\n\nIn addition to the Waukesha situation, Kloppenburg at the news conference cited an \"undervote\" in Milwaukee and Racine; ballot shortages and long lines in Fond du Lac and several other municipalities; and changes in the unofficial vote totals in Winnebago County.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look:\n\n\"Undervotes\": This is when a voter chooses not to vote in all the races listed on a ballot -- creating an \"undervote\" in one race compared with another. For instance, this year in the city of Milwaukee, the Milwaukee County executive\u2019s race drew about 2,000 more votes than the Kloppenburg-Prosser race at the top of the ticket.\n\nKloppenburg campaign manager Melissa Mulliken said Racine and Milwaukee had an unusually high undervote rate in the statewide court race compared with local races there.\n\n\"You wonder why,\" Mulliken said. \"Did voting machines misread ballots?\"\n\nBut in the city of Milwaukee, the 2011 court contest was not the largest court-race undervote in even the last three years. In 2008, when Michael Gableman defeated incumbent Louis Butler for the high court, the Scott Walker-Lena Taylor race for county executive drew 3,500 more votes.\n\nA review going back further shows the court races sometimes draw more and sometimes less than other contests, depending on the competitiveness of the races involved.\n\nIn Racine, the Kloppenburg-Prosser race drew fewer votes than the Racine mayor\u2019s race. It was about 150 votes short, or 1 percent.\n\nThat, too, has happened before: In 2009, Justice Shirley Abrahamson\u2019s breeze to re-election drew substantially fewer votes than a special primary election for Racine mayor. But in 2008, the Gableman-Butler race drew just slightly more than a statewide referendum in Racine.\n\nNot much of a pattern there.\n\nNeil Albrecht, deputy director of the Milwaukee Election Commission, said undervoting is not really an anomaly.\n\n\"It\u2019s more a reflection with people's comfort and familiarity with certain contests and the candidates,\" he said.\n\nUW-Madison political scientist Barry Burden agreed.\n\n\"\u2018Dropoff\u2019 is the term we use,\" said Burden, who studies election administration. \"It doesn\u2019t surprise me at all. That\u2019s reasonable to expect when you have a local race that is grabbing a lot of attention.\"\n\n(Local conditions played out the other way in another Democratic hotbed, Dane County. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\u2019s Craig Gilbert reported that 10,000 more people voted in the court race than in a county exec\u2019s race that was not even close.)\n\nBallot shortages: The unusually high voter turnout in the high court race -- at least 14 points higher statewide than predicted -- fueled ballot shortages in various communities. Kloppenburg cited Fond du Lac County. State election officials ordered the clerk in the city of Fond du Lac to issue substitute ballots because of shortages, and the resulting lines at touchscreen machines and delays in voting.\n\nOur research found other shortages in the counties of Eau Claire, Sheboygan and Winnebago. Together, they involved more than 2,000 votes on photocopied ballots that had to be hand counted.\n\nHow unusual is this? There are mixed views.\n\nBurden said the use of photocopied ballots is fairly common but rarely noticed unless a race is close.\n\nIt\u2019s common enough for the state to have a law that sets out the procedure for issuing substitute ballots when shortages occur, said Reid Magney, spokesman for the state\u2019s Governmental Accountability Board.\n\nOne clerk, Lisa Freiberg of Fond du Lac County, said it was \"very unusual\" in her county to resort to copying paper ballots. Fond du Lac City Clerk Sue Strands, who orders ballots, agreed.\n\nStrands said she considers her vote count solid. She said if there was an \"anomaly\" it was limited to four instances in which voters tried to put their copied ballot into voting machines. They jammed.\n\nKloppenburg\u2019s campaign says the question is how such ballots were counted.\n\nThere is some concern about reliable counts of photocopied ballots, because they can\u2019t be run through voting machines, election clerks say.\nThat necessitated some hand-counting on a busy election night.\n\nDiscrepancies in unofficial results: It\u2019s clear the big Waukesha County vote tally error on election night was unusual. PolitiFact Wisconsin earlier examined a Nickolaus claim that errors in that part of the process are \"common.\" We found that her error was extreme but not unprecedented, and we rated her claim Barely True.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that errors such as the Waukesha County tally and the 1,100-vote miscommunication in the unofficial tally from Winnebago County are reviewed -- and typically corrected -- in the official vote canvasses done by the counties.\n\nThat process -- plus a special state probe of Waukesha County -- is now complete and state officials say the Waukesha and Winnebago discrepancies have been cleared up.\n\nSo if that verification process is already done, does that leave Kloppenburg with much justification for including Waukesha on her problem list? She points out the state will do a deeper investigation of Nickolaus\u2019 past work -- and that the preliminary state probe did find a handful of discrepancies in the county\u2019s canvass of write-in votes.\n\nSo, has Kloppenburg supported her claim?\n\nHer \"undervote\" claims do not hold up; they are not anomalous based on historical patterns. Errors in the unofficial tally were mostly routine and by now have likely been corrected by the standard post-election canvasses. Waukesha County\u2019s situation was rare, but it is only one county, and the big discrepancy there has already been cleared up, according to state elections officials.\n\nIn Kloppenburg\u2019s favor: Ballot shortages -- though not rare and not by themselves evidence of miscounts -- did happen in multiple areas and are by no means the norm. And the Waukesha County situation, while already investigated at length, still has a few loose ends, and questions remain about Nickolaus\u2019 methods.\n\nSo, Kloppenburg\u2019s claim had an element of truth but skipped critical facts that would give a different impression. Some might call it mostly false. But on the Truth-O-Meter, that\u2019s the definition of Barely True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEditor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.
