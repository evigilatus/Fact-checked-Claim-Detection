The announcement says that the former First Lady, Senator and Secretary of State, is \"the person who has proved that she can accomplish it.\" We focus on one claim, that one of the things Clinton did was \"win health care for eight million children.\" Clinton often referred to this achievement. :: During the 2008 presidential campaign, Polyte Fact classified a single declaration as half valid because it implies that it \"had stood alone for comprehensive health care while almost no one would do so.\" In another case, we evaluated her comment correctly because she described her claim, saying that she \"helped\" in establishing a health coverage programme for children -- along with others. Let's reconsider the facts. According to Medicaid, it is true that the health insurance programme for children - known as CHIP - provides health care coverage for more than 8 million children. This programme was established in 1997, known as the State Children &apos; s Health Insurance Programme, and promotes health coverage for low-income children by providing federal funding to the states. The current announcement gives Clinton credit for the \"win\" legislation passed by legislators in Congress when she was First Lady. Her campaign website contains a more precise statement: \"As First Lady, she refused to surrender when Congress defeated health care reform. Instead, I worked with Republicans and Democrats to help establish the Children &apos; s Health Insurance Programme, which now provides health coverage for more than 8 million children. Senator Ted Kennedy said that if it weren't for Hillary there wouldn't be a child health insurance program today. Facebook was published on January 13, 2021 in a Facebook photo showing the Republic. Lauren Boibert with troublemakers in the Capitol before giving them a tour of the building \"one day before the rebellion.\" By Samantha Buterman on January 14, 2021, the late Kennedy received a great deal of credit for CHIP because Democrats in Massachusetts sponsored legislation through Republican-controlled Congress. Utah Sen, Orin Hatch, was the co-sponsor of the Republican President. But in 2007, Kennedy told Associated Press that Hillary Clinton played a crucial role. \"The Children's Health Program will not exist today if we don't have Hillary paid for it from the other side of Pennsylvania Avenue,\" said Kennedy. Nick Littlefield, the chief health adviser in Kennedy, agreed at the time. \"She wasn't legit, she didn't write the law, she wasn't the president, so she didn't make decisions,\" said the Associated Press Television. \"But we relied on it, and we worked with it and it was pivotal in encouraging the White House to do so.\" But Clinton's new declaration has no description that says, \"She's the one who's proven she can do it... winning health care for eight million children.\" Our Governor's Declaration of the Clinton Campaign says one of its achievements was \"the winning health care for eight million children.\" This statement is highly accurate. Clinton was the key to the establishment of the Children &apos; s Health Insurance Programme, which provides coverage for 8 million children. But the ad leaves the contributions of others. Because of that warning, we assess her statement mostly true.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05397"}
