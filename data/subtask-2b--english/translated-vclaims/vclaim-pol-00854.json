Among his achievements, he said that his administration had overseen \"the largest investment ever in K-12 education.\" Let's see if it's really a record break when it comes to funding public schools in Virginia. McCullough started making a midway claim by taking over as governor. As evidence of this, his office sent us a chart detailing the total government aid to schools and funding for each pupil from 2001 to 2018. Maculiff's claim is based on the crude dollar - an amount that has not been adjusted for inflation. When he took office, the government aid index for education was $6.4 billion, which was recorded almost six years ago during the 2008-2009 school year in the last budget before the major recession. Virginia finally broke that record in 2016, when Makulev signed a $6.5 billion budget for the school year that began late that summer. In 2017, Makulev paid his final budget, authorizing $6.8 billion for K-12 - a high sign, again. In raw dollars, Makulev also signed budgets that broke the State Finance Index by $5,248 per student - a figure that was also established during the 2008-2009 school year. From 2017 to 18, the final budget allocated $5,444 per pupil. What about inflation? There is a problem in comparing historical spending levels in terms of the raw funds allocated each year: the dollar spent today or in the future does not buy some of the money spent in the past. So we took a meaningful look at whether the Makulev plan, when adjusted for inflation, will remain the richest school budget in Virginia's history. Check the facts (Kirk Cox) was mentioned on January 13, 2021 in a speech. Virginia ranked lowest third of the states in the management of the COVID-19 vaccine. \u2022 On January 20, 2012, Makulev failed, as we mentioned earlier, in this test. We have adjusted each of the education budgets this century to $2018, using inflation data published by the Bureau of Labour Statistics. Within the framework of these measurements, the water boom was marked in the 2008-2009 school year, when the State spent an average of $7.5 billion on public education. This figure exceeds the peak of $6.8 billion - in crude dollars - in the Makulev budget for 2017-18. In adjusted dollars, the maximum education budget for Moldova in the period 2017-18 is lower than the budgets of the three states that were in effect from July 2006 to June 2009. We have applied the same inflation adjustments to expenditure on each pupil, which is the golden standard in the evaluation of education budgets because it takes into account the high enrolment rates in Virginia. The days of glory for each student &apos; s State expenditure occurred again during the July 2006 to June 2009 budgets. In 2018, Virginia spent $5,675 to $5,966 per pupil during those school years. The Makulev proposal, which peaked at $5,444 per student during the school year 2017-18, did not rise to this level. Side observation: Virginia has not yet recovered all the land it lost due to the Great Depression and will not be recovered very soon. The General Assembly has recently approved education budgets for each of the next two school years, which are not commensurate with inflationary expenditure during the last school year before the recession. Our ruling, McCullough, says that during his reign from 2014 to 2018, Virginia made the \"largest investment ever made in K-12 education.\" In crude dollars, the Ministry of Education has signed its budgets during the last two years, which have established State records of public expenditure on education and the expenses of each student. However, this is misleading, a meaningful comparison of historical expenditure levels requires that the figures be adjusted for inflation. When this is done, Makulev's education budgets have never risen to the levels of the three years preceding the Great Depression. Therefore, we assess the claim of the maklovs as being mostly false.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00854"}
