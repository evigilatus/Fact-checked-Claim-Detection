Try 1932.", "text": "With results only hours away from the country &apos; s closest political races, the intellectuals presented their arguments on Sunday morning in favour of the best and worst candidates for the 2014 midterm elections. One of the men who has been repeatedly mentioned about this ungrateful distinction is the United States (San Pat Roberts), the Republic of Kansas, trapped in an unexpectedly tight race against the independent Greg Orman. Roberts struggled, despite being put into a major conservative state, a headache in the case of Republicans who wanted to take over the Senate. \"There is the most obvious candidate this year. It's Pat Roberts, White House correspondent ABC Jonathan Carl said this week. I mean, Kansas hasn't elected anyone other than the Republicans since before Oz's wizard hit the cinema. The classic film that opens with a hurricane that penetrates the Kansas farm first appeared 75 years ago in 1939. Has it been a long time since Kansas was elected to a person who wasn't a Republican in the United States Senate? In fact, it's been longer. Eighty-two years, to be exact. The last member of the Democratic Senate sent by the State to Washington was George McGill, a lawyer from Wichita who served from 1930-39. After winning the 1932 election, McGill lost his bid to re-election in 1938. The only other members of the Democratic Senate from Kansas were John Martin, who had filled the remainder of the term of office of the deceased Senator from 1893 to 95, and William Howard Thompson, who had served from 1913 to 1919, according to the United States Congressn Biographical Manual. Two members of the Kansas Senate were members of the People &apos; s Party, although both were elected at the end of the century long before the launch of the magical film Oz. All 28 other senators were Republicans, including Roberts, who won his first election in Congress in 1981 and the first Senate race in the United States in 1996. Bordette Loomis, Professor of Political Science at the University of Kansas, said that the presence of a incumbent such as Roberts in such a vulnerable situation was highly unusual. Winning a seat in the U.S. Senate from Kansas was mostly too easy for Republicans. The Republican Party has long dominated all classes of Kansas politics, with the last State vote for a democratic presidential candidate in 1964. (There was a notable exception recently when Kathleen Sebilius won the Governor's Democratic race in 2002 and 2006. He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. By Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021 \"In this context, it's just so strange because this is about an environment as favourable to my public as you can get,\" said Loomis, \"and it's also supposed to be a good year for Republicans all over the country.\" Roberts was weakened early in his re-election by the New York Times report, which revealed that he did not own his own home in Kansas. He survived the initial criticism of the tea party, even though he's from inside Washington. Loomis said that his attacks on Orman had largely failed and that his focus on criticizing President Barack Obama and the majority leader of the Harry Reed Senate was more than documenting his achievements. \"I think Roberts could be easier to win a traditional race,\" said Loomis. \"Running against an independent, it's really harder.\" Although Kansas is usually a reliable conservative state, according to the Gallup analysis, the share of the State in the average resident (36 per cent) is almost the same as those who say they are conservative at 38 per cent. This may be one of the reasons why Orman's doing so well in pre-election polls. Also, according to Gallup, Kansas is on the low end of the 10 most reddest states in terms of population whose political ideology has been described as conservative. The Roberts-Orman race is a throwout by the clear real policy and the Cook political report. The thirty-fifth company Nate Silver offers Orman the opportunity to win by 54 percent. Our verdict on the mid-term campaign with the biggest mistakes, Carl Roberts said, \"The most obvious candidate of the year,\" referring to the fact that \"Kansas has not elected a non-Republican since before the Wizard of Oz hit the cinema.\" Carl's talking point is on the money. Kansas was last elected to the United States Senate in 1932. The Wizard of Oz was released seven years later. His claim rates are correct.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07037"}
