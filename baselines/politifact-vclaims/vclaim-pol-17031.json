This fact directly links Obama to all 150,000 deaths around the world!\"\nA different post makes a similar point: \"Well well well, in 2015 Obama gave the Chinese lab in Wuhan 3.7M grant to study the corona virus what a coincidence.\"\nThe first post builds on the conspiracy theory that the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China created the virus.\u00a0\nIt was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThere\u2019s nothing correct in this post, although President Donald Trump does play a supporting role in spreading some of the inaccurate information at the heart of the claim.\nHere\u2019s where the post either misleads or flat out gets things wrong.\n\"The \u2018biological\u2019 lab in Wuhan where the COVID-19 virus was created.\"\nEarly on in the crisis, the idea took hold that the virology lab in Wuhan engineered the virus. We looked at that claim in detail before and found that the genetic sequence of the virus shows no signs of genetic engineering.\nA research team at Scripps Research compared the virus to viruses that had hit humans, such as the one behind the SARS outbreak, and viruses that are found in animals. All the evidence pointed to a natural source.\n\"We do not believe that any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible,\" the researchers wrote.\nThere are unresolved concerns that protective lapses at the lab may have allowed a virus collected from nature to escape, and to be clear, that is an unproven allegation, and Chinese officials deny it. But that is different from the virus being intentionally manufactured by human hands.\nThe lab was funded by Obama \"in 2015 to the tune of $3,800,000 American dollars!\"\nThe correct amount sent to the Wuhan virology lab is $598,500, and that was spread over five years, according to the American research group running the project.\nHere\u2019s what we know about the lab, that work and the U.S. funding.\nIn 2014, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease backed a project by the EcoHealth Alliance, a nonprofit that aims to protect the people, land and animals in areas where viruses can jump from one species to another, as coronaviruses are known to do. The alliance has projects across 30 countries, including many in Asia, such as Thailand, Vietnam and China.\nThe 2014 project focused on bats in Yunnan province, about 800 miles southwest from Wuhan, on the border with Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar. In 2018, alliance researchers reported they had found a virus in bats very similar to SARS.\n\"If we know what viruses are out there in wildlife, and which people are getting infected, we have a chance to stop pandemics dead in their tracks,\" the group\u2019s president Peter Daszak said in a press release at the time.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMasks have negative impacts on 68% of children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jon Greenberg \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe group contracted the virology lab in Wuhan to conduct the genetic analyses of the viruses that were being collected in the field. The lab was selected after it was approved by the U.S. State Department and NIH.\nThe National Institutes of Health website shows a total award of about $3.4 million over six years to EcoHealth Alliance. The group\u2019s spokesman Robert Kessler told us that, of that, the Wuhan lab received just under $600,000.\nThat\u2019s about 85% less than the Facebook post asserted.\nThat NIH spending included about $265,000 for the lab under the Trump administration. In 2019, NIH renewed the grant to EcoHealth Alliance for another five years. That decision came on Trump\u2019s watch and he said \"we will end that grant very quickly.\"\n\"President Trump just announced\"\nThere is a virology lab in Wuhan, and it did get money from the U.S. National Institutes of Health. But the post exaggerates what Trump said about that.\nIn an April 17 White House coronavirus briefing, a reporter from the conservative website Newsmax asked Trump about the grant. Here\u2019s the exchange:\nReporter: \"(There\u2019s a) report that the NIH, under the Obama administration, in 2015 gave that lab $3.7 million in a grant. Why would the U.S. give a grant like that to China?\"\nTrump: \"The Obama administration gave them a grant of $3.7 million? I\u2019ve been hearing about that. And we\u2019ve instructed that if any grants are going to that area \u2014 we\u2019re looking at it, literally, about an hour ago, and also early in the morning. We will end that grant very quickly.\n\"But it was granted quite a while ago. They were granted a substantial amount of money. We\u2019re going to look at it and take a look. But I understand it was a number of years ago, right?\n\"When did you hear \u2014 when did you hear it was \u2014 the grant was made?\"\nReporter: \"2015.\"\nTrump: \"2015? Who was president then? I wonder.\"\nTrump didn\u2019t announce anything. He responded to the reporter\u2019s question about the grant and said he\u2019d heard about certain reports and was looking into it.\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post said Trump announced that a lab in Wuhan where the COVID-19 virus \"was created\" received $3.8 million under the Obama administration.\nA reader would see this claim and assume millions of U.S. tax dollars were used to create the virus that leads to COVID-19. That isn\u2019t the case.\nTrump didn\u2019t make this announcement. He was responding to a reporter\u2019s question.\nThe best evidence so far says the virus was not created in a lab.\nThe money that went to the lab was about 85% less than what the post said.\nWe rate this claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17031"}
