The first dispensary opened in December 2012.\nWe wondered if the ad\u2019s claim about U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs doctors checked out, especially given the continued delays for health care at the Phoenix VA Health Care System.\nCannabis concessions\nThe prohibition is outlined in the VA\u2019s 2011 directive on medical marijuana.\n\"It is VHA policy to prohibit VA providers from completing forms seeking recommendations or opinions regarding a veteran\u2019s participation in a state marijuana program.\" \u00a0\nAccording to the Drug Enforcement Administration, marijuana is a Schedule I drug, which means it cannot be used for medical purposes and has high potential for abuse.\nThe DEA has a five-schedule drug scale -- the higher the number, the less dangerous. However, 25 states have already legalized medical marijuana. \u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArizonans for Responsible Drug Policy\n\n\nstated on September 15, 2016 in a political advertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Proposition 205 \"blocks market entry\" for new marijuana dispensaries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Anthony Cave \u2022 September 30, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Andrew Saxon of the VA Puget Sound Health Care System in Seattle said federal health care systems have to obey federal laws. Marijuana is still illegal federally.\nHowever, a veteran could still receive VA health care -- as the 2011 directive notes -- and seek medical marijuana elsewhere.\n\"A military veteran who is eligible for VA health care cannot be refused those services if he/she is using medical marijuana authorized by a non-VA health care provider,\" Saxon said.\nLegislation on amending the VA\u2019s policy has\u00a0come up short.\nEarlier this year, an amendment to the VA\u2019s budget bill would have allowed VA doctors to recommend medical marijuana to veterans in states where it\u2019s legal.\nHowever, the amendment was removed from the spending bill, which eventually passed.\nOur ruling\nThe ad claimed, \"VA doctors are prohibited from recommending medical marijuana.\"\nThat\u2019s on the mark.
