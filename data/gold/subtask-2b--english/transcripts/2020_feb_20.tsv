1	Lester Holt	Good evening everyone.
2	Lester Holt	I’m Lester Holt.
3	Lester Holt	Welcome to Las Vegas.
4	Lester Holt	Everything is on the line tonight, with just three days before the critical Nevada caucuses.
5	Lester Holt	Here with me on the stage tonight, NBC News Political Director and moderator of Meet the Press, Chuck Todd.
6	Lester Holt	And NBC News Chief White House correspondent and MSNBC anchor, Hallie Jackson.
7	Lester Holt	Also joining us is Telemundo’s Senior Correspondent, Vanessa Hauc.
8	Lester Holt	And editor of the Nevada Independent Jon Ralston, who has covered Nevada politics for more than three decades.
9	Lester Holt	The rules are this tonight, candidates will get a minute 15 to answer each question and 45 seconds for followups.
10	Lester Holt	Now that the stage has narrowed to six candidates, we encourage each of you to directly engage with each other on the issues.
11	Lester Holt	So let’s get to our first question.
12	Lester Holt	Since the last time you all shared the stage, Senator Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, has surged into the lead nationally in the democratic race.
13	Lester Holt	And there’s a new person on the stage tonight, Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
14	Lester Holt	A former Republican who spent millions of his own dollars to run in this race.
15	Lester Holt	What hasn’t changed?
16	Lester Holt	A majority of democratic voters still say their top priority is beating President Trump.
17	Lester Holt	Senator Sanders, the first question to you, Mayor Bloomberg is pitching himself as a centrist who says he’s best positioned to win in November.
18	Lester Holt	Why is your revolution a better bet?
19	Bernie Sanders	In order to beat Donald Trump, we’re going to need the largest voter turnout in the history of the United States.
20	Bernie Sanders	Mr. Bloomberg had policies in New York city of stop-and-frisk, which went after African American and Latino people in an outrageous way.
21	Bernie Sanders	That is not a way you’re going to grow voter turnout.
22	Bernie Sanders	What our movement is about is bringing working class people together, black and white and Latino, Native American, Asian American, around an agenda that works for all of us and not just the billionaire class.
23	Bernie Sanders	And that agenda says that maybe, just maybe, we should join the rest of the industrialized world, guarantee healthcare to all people as a human right, raise that minimum wage to a living wage of 15 bucks an hour.
24	Bernie Sanders	And have the guts to take on the fossil fuel industry, because their short term profits are not more important than the future of this planet and the need to combat climate change.
25	Bernie Sanders	Those are some of the reasons we have the strongest campaign to defeat Donald Trump.
26	Elizabeth Warren	So I’d like-
27	Lester Holt	Mayor Bloomberg, can Senator Sanders beat President Trump and how do you want to respond to what else he said?
28	Michael Bloomberg	I don’t think there’s any chance of the Senator beating President Trump.
29	Michael Bloomberg	You don’t start out by saying, “I’ve got 160 million people, I’m going to take away the insurance plan that they love.” That’s just not a ways that you go and start building the coalition that the Sanders’ camp thinks that they can do.
30	Michael Bloomberg	I don’t think there’s any chance whatsoever, and if he goes and is the candidate, we will have Donald Trump for another four years and we can’t stand that.
31	Lester Holt	Senator Warren.
32	Elizabeth Warren	I’d like to talk about who we’re running against.
33	Elizabeth Warren	A billionaire who calls women fat broads and horse faced lesbians.
34	Elizabeth Warren	And no, I’m not talking about Donald Trump, I’m talking about mayor Bloomberg.
35	Elizabeth Warren	Democrats are not going to win if we have a nominee who has a history of hiding his tax returns, of harassing women and of supporting racist policies like redlining and stop-and-frisk.
36	Elizabeth Warren	Look, I’ll support whoever the democratic nominee is, but understand this, Democrats take a huge risk if we just substitute one arrogant billionaire for another.
37	Elizabeth Warren	This country has worked for the rich for a long time and left everyone else in the dirt.
38	Elizabeth Warren	It is time to have a president who will be on the side of working families and be willing to get out there and fight for them.
39	Elizabeth Warren	That is why I am in this race and that is how I will beat Donald Trump.
40	Lester Holt	[crosstalk 00:04:14] Senator Klobuchar, what do you think the path is from this stage to the White House?
41	Lester Holt	What works?
42	Amy Klobuchar	I think the path is a high voter turnout.
43	Amy Klobuchar	I’m the one on this stage that had the highest voter turnout of any state in the country, when I led the tip ticket.
44	Amy Klobuchar	As well as bringing in rural and suburban voters and I’ve done that as well.
45	Amy Klobuchar	And I’m the only one with the receipts to have done that in Republican congressional districts over and over again.
46	Amy Klobuchar	But I want to say this, I actually welcomed Mayor Bloomberg to the stage.
47	Amy Klobuchar	I thought that he shouldn’t be hiding behind his TV ads, and so I was already for this big day.
48	Amy Klobuchar	And then I looked at the memo from his campaign staff this morning and it said that he actually thought that three of us should get out of the way.
49	Amy Klobuchar	That is what his campaign said, because we should pave the way for him to become the nominee.
50	Amy Klobuchar	I have been told as a woman, as someone that maybe no one thought was still going to be standing up on this stage, but I am because of pure grit and because of the people out there.
51	Amy Klobuchar	I’ve been told many times to wait my turn and to step aside and I’m not going to do that now and I’m not going to do that because a campaign memo from Mayor Bloomberg said this morning that the only way that we get a nominee is if we step aside for him.
52	Amy Klobuchar	I think we need something different than Donald Trump.
53	Amy Klobuchar	I don’t think you look at Donald Trump and say, we need someone richer in the white house.
54	Lester Holt	Thank you.
55	Lester Holt	Mayor Bloomberg, there’s a lot for you to respond to there, so here’s your opportunity.
56	Michael Bloomberg	I think we have two questions to face tonight.
57	Michael Bloomberg	One is, who can beat Donald Trump?
58	Michael Bloomberg	And number two, who can do the job if they get into the White House?
59	Michael Bloomberg	And I would argue that I am candidate that can do exactly both of those things.
60	Michael Bloomberg	I’m a New Yorker.
61	Michael Bloomberg	I know how to take on an arrogant con man like Donald Trump that comes from New York.
62	Michael Bloomberg	I’m a mayor.
63	Michael Bloomberg	I was a mayor.
64	Michael Bloomberg	I know how to run a complicated city, the biggest, most diverse city in this country.
65	Michael Bloomberg	I’m a manager.
66	Michael Bloomberg	I knew what to do after 9-11 and brought the city back stronger than ever.
67	Michael Bloomberg	And I’m a philanthropist who didn’t inherit his money, but made his money.
68	Michael Bloomberg	And I’m spending that money to get rid of Donald Trump, the worst President we have ever had.
69	Michael Bloomberg	And if I can get that done, it will be a great contribution to America and to my kids.
70	Lester Holt	Vice President Biden, I’ll let you weigh in there.
71	Joe Biden	In terms who can beat Donald Trump, NBC did a poll yesterday, says Joe Biden is best equipped to beat Donald Trump.
72	Joe Biden	That’s what your poll said.
73	Joe Biden	And it said that I can beat him in those toss up states too, those states we have to win.
74	Joe Biden	I’m ahead by eight points across the board.
75	Joe Biden	So in terms of being able to beat Donald Trump, I’m better positioned according to your poll than anybody else to beat Donald Trump, number one.
76	Joe Biden	Number two, the Mayor makes an interesting point.
77	Joe Biden	The mayor says that he has a great record, that he’s done these wonderful things.
78	Joe Biden	Well the fact of the matter is, he has not managed his city very, very well when he was there.
79	Joe Biden	He didn’t get a whole lot done.
80	Joe Biden	He has stop-and-frisk, throwing close to 5 million young black men up against a wall.
81	Joe Biden	And when we came along in our administration, President Obama and said, “We’re going to send in a mediator to stop it.” He said, “That’s unnecessary.” So we’re going to get a chance to talk about the mayor’s record, but in terms of who is best prepared to beat Donald Trump, look at your poll and what it says.
82	Lester Holt	Mayor Buttigieg, you’d like to weigh in.
83	Pete Buttigieg	Yes, we’ve got to wake up as a party.
84	Pete Buttigieg	We could wake up two weeks from today, the day after super Tuesday, and the only candidates left standing will be Bernie Sanders and Mike Bloomberg, the two most polarizing figures on this stage.
85	Pete Buttigieg	And most Americans don’t see where they fit, if they’ve got to choose between a socialist who thinks that capitalism is the root of all evil and a billionaire who thinks that money ought to be the root of all power.
86	Pete Buttigieg	Let’s put forward somebody who actually lives and works in a middle-class neighborhood, in an industrial Midwestern city.
87	Pete Buttigieg	Let’s put forward somebody who’s actually a Democrat.
88	Pete Buttigieg	Look, we shouldn’t have to choose between one candidate who wants to burn this party down and another candidate who wants to buy this party out.
89	Pete Buttigieg	We can do better.
90	Lester Holt	Senator Sanders, are you polarizing?
91	Bernie Sanders	If speaking to the needs and the pain of a long neglected working class is polarizing, I think you got the wrong word.
92	Bernie Sanders	What we are trying finally to do, is to give a voice to people who have to 45 years of work are not making a nickel more than they did 45 years ago.
93	Bernie Sanders	We are giving a voice to people who are saying we are sick of tired of billionaires like Mr. Bloomberg seeing huge expansions of their wealth, while a half a million people sleep out on the street tonight.
94	Bernie Sanders	And that’s what we are saying, Pete, is maybe it’s a time for the working class of this country to have a little bit of power in Washington rather than your billionaire campaign contributors.
95	Pete Buttigieg	All right.
96	Pete Buttigieg	Look, first of all- [crosstalk 00:09:43] Look, my campaign is fueled by hundreds of thousands of contributors-
97	Bernie Sanders	Including 46 billionaires.
98	Pete Buttigieg	Among the hundreds of thousands of contributors.
99	Pete Buttigieg	And look, we’ve got to unite this country to deal with these issues.
100	Pete Buttigieg	You’re not the only one who cares about the working class.
101	Pete Buttigieg	Most Americans believe we need to empower workers.
102	Pete Buttigieg	As a matter of fact, you’re the one who is at war with the Culinary Union right here in Las Vegas.
103	Pete Buttigieg	We can’t-
104	Bernie Sanders	We are more union support than you have ever dreamed of.
105	Pete Buttigieg	We can-
106	Bernie Sanders	We have the support of unions all across this country.
107	Pete Buttigieg	Yeah but the vision I’m putting forward has the support of the American people.
108	Bernie Sanders	Really.
109	Pete Buttigieg	We can actually deliver healthcare without taking it away from anyone.
110	Pete Buttigieg	We can actually empower workers and lift wages without further polarizing this country and we can build a movement without having legions of our supporters online and in person attacking democratic figures and union leaders alike-
111	Hallie Jackson	Senator Warren, I have a question for you.
112	Hallie Jackson	On Sunday, on Meet the Press, Vice President Biden accused Senator Sanders supporters of bullying union leaders here with, “Vicious, malicious misogynistic things.” You said Democrats cannot build an inclusive party on a foundation of hate.
113	Hallie Jackson	Are Senator Sanders and his supporters making it harder for Democrats to unify in November?
114	Elizabeth Warren	Look, I have said many times before, we are all responsible for our supporters.
115	Elizabeth Warren	And we need to step up, that’s what leadership is all about.
116	Elizabeth Warren	But the way we are going to lead this country and beat Donald Trump is going to be with a candidate who has rock solid values and who actually gets something done.
117	Elizabeth Warren	When Mayor Bloomberg was busy blaming African Americans and Latinos for the housing crash of 2008, I was right here in Las Vegas, literally just a few blocks down the street holding hearings on the banks that were taking away homes from millions of families.
118	Elizabeth Warren	That’s when I met Mr. Estrada, one of your neighbors.
119	Elizabeth Warren	He came in to testify and he said he thought he’d done everything right with Wells Fargo.
120	Elizabeth Warren	But what had happened?
121	Elizabeth Warren	They took away his house in a matter of weeks.
122	Elizabeth Warren	This man stood there and cried while he talked about what it was like to tell his two little daughters that they might not be in their elementary schools, that they might be living out of their van.
123	Elizabeth Warren	I spent the next years making sure that would never happen again.
124	Elizabeth Warren	Wall Street fought us every inch of the way on a consumer agency.
125	Elizabeth Warren	They lost and I won.
126	Elizabeth Warren	We need a candidate with unshakeable values and a candidate who can actually get something done for working people.
127	Elizabeth Warren	That’s why I’m in this race-
128	Hallie Jackson	Senator, thank you.
129	Elizabeth Warren	And that’s how I’ll beat Donald Trump.
130	Hallie Jackson	Senator Sanders.
131	Bernie Sanders	We have over 10.6 million people on Twitter and 99.9% of them are decent human beings, are working people, are people who believe in justice, compassion and love.
132	Bernie Sanders	And if there are a few people who make ugly remarks, who attack trade union leaders, I disowned those people, they are not part of our movement.
133	Bernie Sanders	But let me also say, what I hope my friends up here will agree with, is that if you look at the wild West of the internet, talk to some of the African American women on my campaign, talk to Senator Nina Turner, talk to others and find the vicious racist, sexist attacks that are coming their way as well.
134	Bernie Sanders	So I would hope that all of us understand that we should do everything we possibly can to end the viciousness and ugliness on the internet.
135	Bernie Sanders	Our campaign is about issues.
136	Bernie Sanders	It’s about fighting for the working families and the middle class.
137	Bernie Sanders	It is not about vicious attacks on other people.
138	Pete Buttigieg	Senator, when you say that you disown these attacks and you didn’t personally direct them, I believe you.
139	Bernie Sanders	Well thank you.
140	Pete Buttigieg	But at a certain point you got to ask yourself, why did this pattern arise?
141	Pete Buttigieg	Why is it especially the case among your supporters that this happens?
142	Bernie Sanders	I don’t think it is especially the case by the way-
143	Pete Buttigieg	That’s just not true.
144	Pete Buttigieg	People-
145	Bernie Sanders	Pete if you want to talk to some of the women on my campaign, what you will see is the most ugly, sexist, racist attacks that are… I won’t even describe them here, they’re so disgusting.
146	Bernie Sanders	And let me say something else about this, not being too paranoid.
147	Bernie Sanders	All of us remember 2016 and what we remember his efforts by Russians and others to try to interfere in our election and divide us up.
148	Bernie Sanders	I’m not saying that’s happening, but it would not shock me.
149	Bernie Sanders	I saw some of those tweets regarding the Culinary Workers Union.
150	Bernie Sanders	I have a 30 year, 100% pro-union voting record.
151	Bernie Sanders	Do you think I would support or anybody supports me, would be attacking union leaders?
152	Bernie Sanders	It’s not thinkable.
153	Pete Buttigieg	But leadership is about what you draw out of people.
154	Pete Buttigieg	It’s about how you inspire people to act.
155	Pete Buttigieg	And right now we’re in this toxic political environment.
156	Pete Buttigieg	Leadership isn’t just about policy.
157	Pete Buttigieg	I think, at least in broad terms, we’re largely pulling in the same direction on policy.
158	Pete Buttigieg	But leadership is also about how you motivate people to treat other people and I think you have to accept some responsibility and ask yourself what it is about your campaign and in particular that seems to be motivating this behavior more than others?
159	Pete Buttigieg	Because in order to turn the page-
160	Amy Klobuchar	I have an idea.
161	Amy Klobuchar	I have an idea of how we can stop sexism on the internet.
162	Amy Klobuchar	We could nominate a woman for candidate for President of the United States.
163	Amy Klobuchar	I think that might go a long way, if we showed our stuff as a party.
164	Amy Klobuchar	And the other thing I’m going to talk about is really what is at the core of this issue between Senator Sanders and the Culinary Union.
165	Amy Klobuchar	And that is this, these are hardworking people.
166	Amy Klobuchar	Housekeepers, like Elizabeth and I met with last night, who have healthcare plans that have been negotiated over time, sweat and blood.
167	Amy Klobuchar	And that is the truth for so many Americans right now-
168	Hallie Jackson	Senator thank you.
169	Amy Klobuchar	There are 149 million Americans that would lose their current health insurance under Senator Sanders’ bill.
170	Hallie Jackson	Senator thank you.
171	Amy Klobuchar	That’s what it says on page eight and I don’t think we should forget that.
172	Hallie Jackson	On that note, I want to turn it over to my colleague Chuck Todd.
173	Chuck Todd	Senator Sanders, I’m going to stay on this topic, on this issue with the Culinary Union.
174	Chuck Todd	Obviously their leaders are warning their members about that your health care plan will take away their healthcare plan, take away private insurance completely.
175	Chuck Todd	There are some Democrats who like you a lot, but worry that this plan, Medicare-for-all, is going to take away private insurance and that it goes too far.
176	Chuck Todd	Are they right?
177	Bernie Sanders	No.
178	Bernie Sanders	Let me be very clear, two points.
179	Bernie Sanders	For a hundred years, from Teddy Roosevelt to Barack Obama, this country has been talking about the need to guarantee health care for people.
180	Bernie Sanders	And yet today, despite spending twice as much per capita, Chuck, twice as much as any other major country on earth, we got 87 million who are uninsured or under insured.
181	Bernie Sanders	We got over 60,000 people who die every year because they don’t get to a doctor on time.
182	Bernie Sanders	We’re getting ripped off outrageously by the greed and corruption of the pharmaceutical industry, which in some cases charges us 10 times more for the same drugs because of their price fixing.
183	Bernie Sanders	500,000 people go bankrupt every year because they can’t afford medical bills.
184	Bernie Sanders	So let me be very clear, to my good friends in the Culinary Workers Union, a great union, I will never sign a bill that will reduce the health care benefits they have.
185	Bernie Sanders	We will only expand it, for them, for every union in America and for the working class of this country.
186	Chuck Todd	Senator Warren, you were all in on Medicare-for-all and then you have since came up with a transition plan.
187	Chuck Todd	Is it because of the impact on unions?
188	Elizabeth Warren	So I want to be clear.
189	Elizabeth Warren	I’ve been to the Culinary Unions’ healthcare facilities, they’re terrific.
190	Elizabeth Warren	You don’t want to shut them down, you want to expand them.
191	Elizabeth Warren	You want to see them all across Nevada and all across this country.
192	Elizabeth Warren	But we need to get everybody’s healthcare plan out here.
193	Elizabeth Warren	Mayor Buttigieg really has a slogan that was thought up by his consultants, to paper over a thin version of a plan that would leave millions of people unable to afford their healthcare.
194	Elizabeth Warren	It’s not a plan, it’s a PowerPoint.
195	Elizabeth Warren	And Amy’s plan is even less, it’s like a Post-it Note, insert plan here.
196	Elizabeth Warren	Bernie has started very much, has a good start.
197	Elizabeth Warren	But instead of expanding and bringing in more people to help, instead his campaign relentlessly attacks everyone who asks a question or tries to fill in details about how to actually make this work.
198	Elizabeth Warren	And then his own advisor’s say, “Eh, probably won’t happen anyway.” Look, healthcare is a crisis in this country.
199	Elizabeth Warren	My approach to this is we need as much help for as many people as quickly as possible and bring in as many supporters as we can.
200	Elizabeth Warren	And if we don’t get it all the first time, take the win and come back into the fight to ask for more.
201	Chuck Todd	I promise guys, I’m going to get everybody in.
202	Elizabeth Warren	People need our help on this.
203	Chuck Todd	I got you.
204	Chuck Todd	Mayor Buttigieg, I think she named checked you first.
205	Chuck Todd	I’ll let you go first.
206	Bernie Sanders	She name checked me second.
207	Chuck Todd	Yes.
208	Chuck Todd	Well, okay.
209	Chuck Todd	I think Amy’s second.
210	Pete Buttigieg	I’m more of a Microsoft Word guy.
211	Pete Buttigieg	And if you look at my plan, I don’t know if there are any PowerPoints on it, but you can definitely find the document on peteforamerica.com.
212	Pete Buttigieg	And you’ll see that it is a plan that solves the problem, makes sure there is no such thing as an uninsured American and does it without kicking anybody off the plan that they have.
213	Pete Buttigieg	This idea that the union members don’t know what’s good for them is the exact kind of condescension and arrogance that makes people skeptical of the policies we’ve been putting forward.
214	Pete Buttigieg	Here we have a plan that the majority of Americans support.
215	Pete Buttigieg	Do you realize how historic that is?
216	Pete Buttigieg	That the American people are ready in a way, far beyond what was true even 10 years ago and what was available to President Obama at the time.
217	Pete Buttigieg	There’s a powerful American majority ready to undertake the biggest, most progressive reform we’ve had in healthcare in 50 years, just so long as we don’t force it on anybody.
218	Pete Buttigieg	What is wrong with that?
219	Elizabeth Warren	Can I respond to that?
220	Elizabeth Warren	[crosstalk 00:20:20]
221	Chuck Todd	Let me get Senator Klobuchar and then I’ll have you respond.
222	Chuck Todd	All right, Senator Klobuchar.
223	Bernie Sanders	[inaudible 00:20:24].
224	Chuck Todd	I think the Post-it Note came first, Senator.
225	Chuck Todd	[crosstalk 00:20:28]
226	Amy Klobuchar	I must say personal offense since post it notes were invented in my state.
227	Amy Klobuchar	[crosstalk 00:00:20:38].
228	Amy Klobuchar	Okay.
229	Amy Klobuchar	So my plan is a public option and according to all the studies out there, it would reduce premiums for 12 million people immediately.
230	Amy Klobuchar	It would expand coverage for about that same number.
231	Amy Klobuchar	It is a significant thing, it is what Barack Obama wanted to do from the very beginning.
232	Amy Klobuchar	And the way I look at it since we’re in Vegas, when it comes to your plan, Elizabeth and Bernie’s on Medicare-for-all, you don’t put your money on a number that’s not even on the wheel.
233	Amy Klobuchar	And why is Medicare-for-all not on the wheel?
234	Amy Klobuchar	Why is it not on the wheel?
235	Amy Klobuchar	Because two thirds of the democratic Senators are not even on that bill, because a bunch of the new House members that got elected see the problems with blowing up the Affordable Care Act.
236	Amy Klobuchar	They see it right in front of them.
237	Amy Klobuchar	And the truth is that when you see some troubled waters, you don’t blow up a bridge, you build one.
238	Amy Klobuchar	And so we need to improve the Affordable Care Act, not blow it up.
239	Chuck Todd	All right, Senator Sanders.
240	Elizabeth Warren	Can I just respond to these two?
241	Chuck Todd	I will.
242	Chuck Todd	You name checked three of them.
243	Chuck Todd	Let me get Senator Sanders in there.
244	Bernie Sanders	I am also a top-
245	Chuck Todd	You were.
246	Elizabeth Warren	Okay.
247	Chuck Todd	Go ahead, Senator Sanders.
248	Chuck Todd	We’ll get you in Liz.
249	Chuck Todd	We got a lot of people in here that got hit.
250	Chuck Todd	[crosstalk 00:21:50]
251	Bernie Sanders	It’s my turn, yeah?
252	Chuck Todd	Yes sir.
253	Bernie Sanders	Okay.
254	Bernie Sanders	Somehow or another, Canada can provide universal health care to all their people at half the cost.
255	Bernie Sanders	UK can do it, France can do, Germany did.
256	Bernie Sanders	All…
257	Bernie Sanders	… half the cost.
258	Bernie Sanders	UK can do it.
259	Bernie Sanders	France can do it.
260	Bernie Sanders	Germany could.
261	Bernie Sanders	All of Europe can do it.
262	Bernie Sanders	Gee whiz.
263	Bernie Sanders	Somehow or another, we are the only major country on earth that can’t do it.
264	Bernie Sanders	Why is that?
265	Bernie Sanders	And I’ll tell you why.
266	Bernie Sanders	It’s because last year the healthcare industry made $100 billion in profits.
267	Bernie Sanders	Pharmaceutical industry, top six companies, $69 billion in profit.
268	Bernie Sanders	And those CEOs are contributing to Pete’s campaign and other campaigns.
269	Bernie Sanders	Up here-
270	Chuck Todd	Let’s clear this up right now.
271	Bernie Sanders	Maybe it is finally time that we said as a nation, “Enough is enough.
272	Bernie Sanders	The function of a rational healthcare system is not to make the pharmaceutical industry and the drug companies rich.
273	Bernie Sanders	It is to provide healthcare to all people as a human right, not a privilege.” No premiums.
274	Chuck Todd	Mr. Vice President, we get it.
275	Bernie Sanders	No copayments.
276	Bernie Sanders	No deductibles.
277	Chuck Todd	Go ahead.
278	Chuck Todd	[crosstalk 00:22:59] Mr. Vice President, center one.
279	Joe Biden	I’m the only one in this stage that actually got anything done on healthcare.
280	Joe Biden	I’m the guy the president turned to and said, “Go get the votes for Obamacare.” And I notice what everybody’s talking about is the plan that I first introduced.
281	Joe Biden	That is to go and add to Obamacare, provide a public option, a Medicare like option it cost and increase the subsidies.
282	Joe Biden	It costs a lot of money.
283	Joe Biden	It cost $750 billion over 10 years, but I pay for it by making sure that Mike and other people pay at the same tax rate their secretary pays at.
284	Joe Biden	That’s how we get it paid, number one.
285	Joe Biden	Number two, you know from the moment we passed that signature legislation, Mike called it a disgrace.
286	Joe Biden	Number one.
287	Joe Biden	Number two, Trump decided to get rid of it.
288	Joe Biden	And number three, my friends here came up with another plan.
289	Joe Biden	But they don’t tell you when you ask Bernie how much it costs, the last time he said that, if he goes on your show, he said, “We’ll find out.
290	Joe Biden	We’ll find out how,” or something to that effect.
291	Joe Biden	It cost over 35 trillion bucks.
292	Joe Biden	Let’s get real.
293	Chuck Todd	Senator Warren, you get the final word on this.
294	Chuck Todd	We’re going to move to another question.
295	Chuck Todd	Go ahead, Senator Warren.
296	Bernie Sanders	And your plan costs $50 trillion.
297	Elizabeth Warren	So I actually-
298	Michael Bloomberg	What am I?
299	Michael Bloomberg	Chicken liver?
300	Elizabeth Warren	So I actually took a look at the plans that are posted.
301	Elizabeth Warren	Mayor Buttigieg, there are four expenses that families pay, right?
302	Elizabeth Warren	Premiums, deductibles, copays, and uncovered medical expenses.
303	Elizabeth Warren	Mayor Buttigieg says he will put a cap only on the premiums.
304	Pete Buttigieg	That’s not true.
305	Elizabeth Warren	And that means families are going to pick up the rest of the costs.
306	Elizabeth Warren	Amy, I looked online at your plan.
307	Elizabeth Warren	It’s two paragraphs.
308	Elizabeth Warren	Families are suffering and they need a plan.
309	Amy Klobuchar	Okay, that’s it.
310	Elizabeth Warren	You can’t simply stand here and trash an idea to give healthcare coverage to everyone without having a realistic plan of your own.
311	Elizabeth Warren	And if you’re not going to own up to the fact either that you don’t have a plan or that your plan is going to leave people without healthcare coverage, full coverage, then you need to say so.
312	Elizabeth Warren	I just want to stay on this [crosstalk 00:25:01] was in Reno when I met a man who said he had diabetes.
313	Elizabeth Warren	He gets his insulin through the VA, but his sister and his daughter also have diabetes.
314	Elizabeth Warren	No way to pay for their insulin.
315	Elizabeth Warren	Three human beings right here in Nevada who are struggling.
316	Elizabeth Warren	They share one insulin prescription.
317	Elizabeth Warren	This should not happen [crosstalk 00:25:24]
318	Chuck Todd	Okay.
319	Chuck Todd	Very quickly.
320	Chuck Todd	Mayor Bloomberg, is Vice President Biden right and you weren’t a fan of Obamacare?
321	Michael Bloomberg	I am a fan of Obamacare.
322	Michael Bloomberg	At the beginning –
323	Joe Biden	Since when Mr. Mayor?
324	Michael Bloomberg	Mr Vice President, I just checked the record because you’d said one time that I was not.
325	Michael Bloomberg	In ’09 I testified and gave a speech before the mayor’s conference in Washington advocating it and trying to get all the mayors to sign on.
326	Michael Bloomberg	And I think at that time I wrote an article praising Obamacare.
327	Michael Bloomberg	It was either in the New York Post or the Daily News, so the facts are, I was [crosstalk 00:25:56]
328	Joe Biden	Didn’t you call it [crosstalk 00:25:56]
329	Michael Bloomberg	Let me finish.
330	Michael Bloomberg	Thank you.
331	Michael Bloomberg	I was in favor of it.
332	Michael Bloomberg	I thought it didn’t do … go as far as we should.
333	Michael Bloomberg	What Trump has done to this is a disgrace.
334	Michael Bloomberg	The first thing we’ve got to do is get the White House and bring back those things that will left and then find a ways to expand it.
335	Michael Bloomberg	Another public option to having some rules about capping charges.
336	Michael Bloomberg	All of those things.
337	Michael Bloomberg	We shouldn’t just walk away and start something that is totally new, untried.
338	Michael Bloomberg	People [crosstalk 00:26:27]
339	Chuck Todd	Okay.
340	Chuck Todd	Vice President Biden, go ahead.
341	Joe Biden	The mayor said when we passed it, the signature piece of this administration, it’s a disgrace.
342	Joe Biden	They’re the exact words.
343	Joe Biden	It was a disgrace.
344	Joe Biden	Look it up.
345	Joe Biden	Check it out.
346	Joe Biden	It was a disgrace.
347	Joe Biden	[crosstalk 00:26:42] covered by the way, that plan you do not have surprise billing.
348	Joe Biden	You bring down drug prices.
349	Joe Biden	People are not … Give people all the things we’re just talking about.
350	Joe Biden	I guess you’re not got all the time to do it, but if I get a chance to talk [crosstalk 00:26:55]
351	Chuck Todd	Thank you, sir.
352	Chuck Todd	Lester.
353	Lester Holt	All right, Mayor Bloomberg [crosstalk 00:26:59]
354	Female	We haven’t responded to [crosstalk 00:26:59] allegation.
355	Lester Holt	… at the beginning of this debate, you took some incoming fire on this next topic, so let’s get into it.
356	Lester Holt	In 2015 this is how you described your policing policy as mayor quote, “We put all the cops in the minority neighborhoods.” And you explain that is quote, “Because that’s where all the crime is.”
357	Lester Holt	You went on to say, “And the way you should get the guns out of the kids’ hands is to throw them against the wall and frisk them.” You’ve apologized for that policy, but what does that kind of language say about how you view people of color or people in minority neighborhoods?
358	Michael Bloomberg	Well, if I go back and look at my time in office, the one thing that I’m really worried about, embarrassed about, was how it turned out with Stop and Frisk.
359	Michael Bloomberg	When I got into office, there was 650 murders a year in New York City.
360	Michael Bloomberg	I thought that my first responsibility was to give people the right to live.
361	Michael Bloomberg	That’s the basic right of everything.
362	Michael Bloomberg	And we started, we adopted a policy which had been in place.
363	Michael Bloomberg	The policy that all big police departments use of stop and frisk.
364	Michael Bloomberg	What happened, however was it got out of control.
365	Michael Bloomberg	And when we discovered, I discovered, that we were doing many, many, too many stop and frisks, we cut 95% of it out.
366	Michael Bloomberg	I’ve sat down with a bunch of African-American clergy and business people to talk about this, to try to learn.
367	Michael Bloomberg	I’ve talked to a number of kids who’d been stopped.
368	Michael Bloomberg	I was trying to understand how we change our policies so we can keep the city safe because the crime rate did go from 650, 50% down, to 300.
369	Michael Bloomberg	And we have to keep lid on crime, but we cannot go out and stop people indiscriminately.
370	Michael Bloomberg	That was what was happening.
371	Lester Holt	Mayor, thank you.
372	Lester Holt	Let me go to Vice President Biden with this.
373	Lester Holt	You want to respond to that?
374	Lester Holt	Put an end to it?
375	Joe Biden	Yes.
376	Joe Biden	Let’s get something straight.
377	Joe Biden	The reason the stop and frisk change is because Barack Obama sent moderators to see what was going on.
378	Joe Biden	When we sent them there to say, “This practice has to stop,” the mayor thought it was a terrible idea.
379	Joe Biden	We send them there, a terrible idea.
380	Joe Biden	Let’s get the facts straight.
381	Joe Biden	Let’s get the order straight.
382	Joe Biden	And it’s not whether he apologize or not, it’s the policy.
383	Joe Biden	The policy was abhorrent and it was, in fact, of violation of every right people have.
384	Joe Biden	We are the one, our administration sent in people to monitor it.
385	Joe Biden	And the very time the mayor argued against that.
386	Joe Biden	This idea that he figured out it was a bad idea.
387	Joe Biden	He figured out it was a bad idea after we sent in monitors and said it must stop.
388	Joe Biden	Even then he continued the policy.
389	Lester Holt	All right.
390	Lester Holt	Mayor, would you like to make a quick response to that?
391	Michael Bloomberg	Yes, I would.
392	Michael Bloomberg	I’ve sat.
393	Michael Bloomberg	I’ve apologized.
394	Michael Bloomberg	I’ve asked for forgiveness, but the bottom line is that we stopped too many people.
395	Michael Bloomberg	We stopped too many people and we’ve got to make sure that we do something about criminal justice in this country.
396	Michael Bloomberg	There is no great answer to a lot of these problems.
397	Michael Bloomberg	If we took off everybody that was wrong off this panel, everybody that was wrong on criminal justice at some time in their careers, there’d be nobody else up here.
398	Lester Holt	Senator Warren.
399	Bernie Sanders	Let’s be clear.
400	Bernie Sanders	I’m sorry.
401	Bernie Sanders	Who did you call on?
402	Lester Holt	Senator Warren.
403	Elizabeth Warren	I do think that this really is about leadership and accountability.
404	Elizabeth Warren	When the mayor says that he apologized, listen very closely to the apology.
405	Elizabeth Warren	The language he used is about stop and frisk.
406	Elizabeth Warren	It’s about how it turned out.
407	Elizabeth Warren	Now this isn’t about how it turned out.
408	Elizabeth Warren	This is about what it was designed to do to begin with.
409	Elizabeth Warren	It targeted communities of color, it targeted black and brown men from the beginning.
410	Elizabeth Warren	And if you want to issue a real apology, then the apology has to start with the intent of the plan as it was put together and the willful ignorance day by day by day of admitting what was happening.
411	Elizabeth Warren	Even as people protested in your own street, shutting out the sounds of people telling you how your own policy was breaking their lives.
412	Elizabeth Warren	You need a different apology.
413	Lester Holt	Senator, thank you.
414	Lester Holt	Chuck?
415	Bernie Sanders	Can I respond here?
416	Chuck Todd	Senator Klobuchar, we’re going to stay on this topic, but I want to get something in here with Senator Klobuchar.
417	Chuck Todd	When you were the top prosecutor in Minneapolis, Senator, there were at least two dozen instances where police were involved in the deaths of civilians.
418	Chuck Todd	None of those officers were prosecuted.
419	Chuck Todd	You did prosecute a black teenager who was sentenced to life in prison despite what are now serious doubts about the evidence.
420	Chuck Todd	Now, the Minneapolis chapter of the NAACP has recently called for you to suspend your campaign over that case because some new evidence has come out since.
421	Chuck Todd	Big picture.
422	Chuck Todd	Why should black and Latino voters trust your judgment now if it appears you may have gotten it wrong then?
423	Amy Klobuchar	First, I’ll start with that case.
424	Amy Klobuchar	It is very clear that any evidence, if there is new evidence, even old evidence, it should be reviewed by that office and by the County attorney.
425	Amy Klobuchar	That must happen.
426	Amy Klobuchar	I have called for that review.
427	Amy Klobuchar	This was a case involving an 11-year-old African-American girl named Tyesha Edwards who was shot doing her homework at her kitchen table.
428	Amy Klobuchar	Three people were convicted.
429	Amy Klobuchar	One of the cases is the one that is being investigated … was investigated by a journalist.
430	Amy Klobuchar	And I think it’s very important that that evidence come forward.
431	Amy Klobuchar	In terms of the police shootings that you noted, those went to a grand jury, every single one of them.
432	Amy Klobuchar	And I made very clear, for months now, that like so many prosecutors, I think those cases, in my time, they were all going to the grand jury.
433	Amy Klobuchar	It was thought that was the best way to handle them in many, many jurisdictions.
434	Moderator	Do you think you should’ve spoke up?
435	Moderator	You didn’t speak up at the time.
436	Moderator	Should you?
437	Amy Klobuchar	I actually did speak up on something very similar and that was when our police chief in Minneapolis tried to take the investigations of police shootings into his own hands.
438	Amy Klobuchar	I strongly said I disagreed with that.
439	Amy Klobuchar	Now I do believe also that a prosecutor should make those decisions herself.
440	Amy Klobuchar	And the last thing I will say, because you asked the question about voting, I have the support of African-Americans in my community in every election.
441	Amy Klobuchar	I had strong support and strong support of leadership.
442	Amy Klobuchar	And that’s because I earned it.
443	Amy Klobuchar	And this is going to be on me to earn it.
444	Amy Klobuchar	You earn it with what you stand for when it comes to equal opportunity.
445	Amy Klobuchar	You earn it with the work that I have done, the leadership I’ve shown on voting rights.
446	Amy Klobuchar	And yes, you earn it with the work that must be done on criminal justice reform.
447	Moderator	Thank you, Senator.
448	Moderator	Hallie Jackson.
449	Hallie Jackson	I wan to talk about transparency here.
450	Hallie Jackson	[inaudible 00:33:45] many Democrats, including most of you on stage, have criticized president Trump for his lack of transparency.
451	Hallie Jackson	But Senator Sanders, when you are here in Las Vegas in October, you are hospitalized with a heart attack.
452	Hallie Jackson	Afterwards, you pledged to make a quote, “All your medical records public.” You’ve released three letters from your doctors, but you now say you won’t release anything more.
453	Hallie Jackson	What happened to your promise of full transparency?
454	Bernie Sanders	I think we did.
455	Bernie Sanders	Let me tell you what happened.
456	Bernie Sanders	First of all, you’re right and thank you Las Vegas for the excellent medical care I got in the hospital two days.
457	Bernie Sanders	And I think the one area, maybe that Mayor Bloomberg and I share, you have stents as well.
458	Michael Bloomberg	25 years ago.
459	Bernie Sanders	Well, we both have two stents.
460	Bernie Sanders	It’s a procedure that is done about a million times a year.
461	Bernie Sanders	So we released the full report of that heart attack.
462	Bernie Sanders	Second of all, we released the full, my whole 29 years in the Capitol, the attending physician, all of my history, medical history.
463	Bernie Sanders	And furthermore, we released reports from two leading Vermont cardiologist who described my situation.
464	Bernie Sanders	And by the way, who said, “Bernie Sanders is more than able to deal with the stress and the vigor of being president of the United States.” Hey, follow me around the campaign trail.
465	Bernie Sanders	Three, four, five events a day.
466	Bernie Sanders	See how you’re doing compared to me.
467	Hallie Jackson	Mayor Buttigieg, you’ve been critical about transparency on this stage and people needing to do better.
468	Hallie Jackson	Is that response from Senator Sanders enough for you?
469	Pete Buttigieg	No, it’s not because, first of all, let me say we are all delighted that you are in fighting shape.
470	Bernie Sanders	Thank you.
471	Pete Buttigieg	And at the same time, transparency matters, especially living through the Trump era.
472	Pete Buttigieg	Now under president Obama, the standard was that the president would release full medical records.
473	Pete Buttigieg	Do a physical and release the readout.
474	Pete Buttigieg	I think that’s the standard that we should hold ourselves to as well.
475	Pete Buttigieg	Now, President Trump lowered that standard.
476	Pete Buttigieg	He said just a letter from a doctor is enough, and a lot of folks on this stage are now saying that’s enough.
477	Pete Buttigieg	But I am certainly prepared to get a physical, put out the results.
478	Pete Buttigieg	I think everybody here should be willing to do the same.
479	Pete Buttigieg	But I’m actually less concerned about the lack of transparency on Sander’s personal health than I am about the lack of transparency on how to pay for his healthcare plan.
480	Pete Buttigieg	Since he said that it’s impossible to even know how much it’s going to cost.
481	Pete Buttigieg	And even after raising taxes on everybody making $29,000, there is still a multi-trillion dollar hole.
482	Pete Buttigieg	Matter of fact, if you add up his policies altogether, they come to $50 trillion.
483	Pete Buttigieg	He’s only explained $25 trillion worth of revenue, which means that the hole in there is bigger than the size of the entire economy of the United States.
484	Hallie Jackson	Mayor Buttigieg-
485	Pete Buttigieg	The time has come to level with the American people on matters personal and on matters of policy.
486	Hallie Jackson	Thank you.
487	Hallie Jackson	Senator Sanders, quickly.
488	Bernie Sanders	Let’s level.
489	Bernie Sanders	Let’s level, Pete.
490	Bernie Sanders	Under your plan, which is a maintenance continuation of the status quo-
491	Pete Buttigieg	That’s-
492	Bernie Sanders	Can I finish?
493	Bernie Sanders	The average American today is paying $12,000 a year.
494	Bernie Sanders	That’s what that family is paying.
495	Bernie Sanders	20% of a 60,000 income, $12,000 a year.
496	Bernie Sanders	Highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.
497	Bernie Sanders	Just the other day, a major study came out from Yale, epidemiologists in Lancet, one of the leading medical publications in the world.
498	Bernie Sanders	What they said, my friends, is Medicare for all will save $450 billion a year because we are eliminated the absurdity of thousands of separate plans that required hundreds of billions of dollars of administration.
499	Bernie Sanders	And by the way, ending the hundred billion a year in profiteering for the drug companies and the insurance companies.
500	Pete Buttigieg	This is really important.
501	Pete Buttigieg	[crosstalk 00:37:29]
502	Hallie Jackson	Senator Sanders, thank you.
503	Hallie Jackson	Mayor Bloomberg, I want to go to you on this.
504	Bernie Sanders	Your plan, by the way [crosstalk 00:37:31] costs.
505	Pete Buttigieg	That’s false.
506	Pete Buttigieg	Look, if my plan is to status quo, why was it attacked by the insurance industry the moment it came out?
507	Pete Buttigieg	And on issue after issue after issue, this is what Senator Sanders is saying.
508	Pete Buttigieg	If you’re not with him, if you’re not all the way on his side, then you must be for the status quo.
509	Pete Buttigieg	Well you know what?
510	Pete Buttigieg	That is a picture that leaves most of the American people out.
511	Hallie Jackson	I want to go to Mayor Bloomberg on this, the transparency issue.
512	Hallie Jackson	Very briefly on transparency, Mayor Bloomberg, your campaign has said that you would eventually release your tax records-
513	Michael Bloomberg	Yes.
514	Hallie Jackson	… when it comes to transparency, but people are already voting now.
515	Hallie Jackson	Why should democratic voters have to wait?
516	Michael Bloomberg	It just takes us a long time.
517	Michael Bloomberg	Unfortunately or fortunately-
518	Amy Klobuchar	Can I comment on that?
519	Michael Bloomberg	Fortunately, I make a lot of money and we do business all around the world and we are preparing it.
520	Michael Bloomberg	The number of pages will probably be in the thousands of pages.
521	Michael Bloomberg	I can’t go to Turbo Tax, but I put out my tax return every year for 12 years in city hall.
522	Michael Bloomberg	We will put out this one.
523	Michael Bloomberg	It says, tells everybody everything they need to know about every investments that I make and where the money goes.
524	Michael Bloomberg	And the biggest item is all the money I give away, and we list that.
525	Michael Bloomberg	Every single donation I make, and you can get that from our foundation anytime you want.
526	Amy Klobuchar	I’m just looking at my husband in the front row that has to like do our taxes all the time.
527	Amy Klobuchar	We probably could go to Turbo Tax.
528	Amy Klobuchar	And the point of this is I believe in transparency.
529	Amy Klobuchar	I had a physical, by the way.
530	Amy Klobuchar	It came out well.
531	Amy Klobuchar	We might all be surprised if my blood pressure is lower than Mayor Pete’s.
532	Amy Klobuchar	That might really shock everyone out there.
533	Amy Klobuchar	And I think you should release your records from your physical.
534	Amy Klobuchar	Secondly, when it comes to tax returns, everyone up here has released their tax returns, Mayor.
535	Amy Klobuchar	And it is a major issue because the president of the United States has been hiding behind his tax returns, even when courts order him to come forward with those tax returns.
536	Amy Klobuchar	I don’t care how much money anyone has.
537	Amy Klobuchar	I think it’s great you got a lot of money, but I think you’ve got to come forward with your tax returns.
538	Hallie Jackson	Senator Warren, I’m going to get to you in a second.
539	Hallie Jackson	Mayor Bloomberg, quick response to Senator Klobuchar.
540	Michael Bloomberg	We’re releasing them.
541	Michael Bloomberg	They’ll be out in a few weeks, and that’s just as fast as I can do it.
542	Michael Bloomberg	Remember, I only entered into this race 10 weeks ago.
543	Michael Bloomberg	All of my associates here have been at this for a couple of years.
544	Pete Buttigieg	That’s right, we have.
545	Michael Bloomberg	And we did not [crosstalk 00:39:52]
546	Pete Buttigieg	Engaging with voters and humbling ourselves in backyards [crosstalk 00:39:53]
547	Hallie Jackson	Let me ask you about something else, Mr. Mayor because-
548	Elizabeth Warren	10 weeks ago [crosstalk 00:39:53] over time and get it done.
549	Hallie Jackson	Mayor Bloomberg, let me ask you about something else.
550	Hallie Jackson	Senator Warren.
551	Michael Bloomberg	Wish it were that simple.
552	Hallie Jackson	I’ll let you get in here.
553	Hallie Jackson	But Mayor Bloomberg-
554	Michael Bloomberg	It would save me a lot of money.
555	Hallie Jackson	Let me ask you about something else.
556	Hallie Jackson	Several former employees have claimed that your company was a hostile workplace for women.
557	Hallie Jackson	When you were confronted about it, you admitted making sexually suggestive remarks saying quote, “That’s the way I grew up.” In a lawsuit in the 1990s, according to the Washington Post, one former female employee alleged that you said quote, “I would do you in a second.” Should Democrats expect better from their nominee?
558	Michael Bloomberg	Let me say a couple things and if I can have my full minute and a quarter.
559	Michael Bloomberg	Thank you.
560	Michael Bloomberg	I have no tolerance for the kind of behavior that the Me Too Movement has exposed.
561	Michael Bloomberg	And anybody that does anything wrong in our company, we investigate it.
562	Michael Bloomberg	And if it’s appropriate, they’re gone that day.
563	Michael Bloomberg	But let me tell you what I do in my company and my foundation and in city government when I was there.
564	Michael Bloomberg	In my foundation, the person that runs, it’s a woman.
565	Michael Bloomberg	70% of the people there are women.
566	Michael Bloomberg	In my company, lots and lots of women have big responsibilities.
567	Michael Bloomberg	They get paid exactly the same as men.
568	Michael Bloomberg	And in city hall, the person that’s the top person, my deputy mayor was a woman and 40% of our commissioners were women.
569	Michael Bloomberg	I am very proud of the fact that about two weeks ago we were awarded, we were voted the most … the best place to work, second best place in America.
570	Michael Bloomberg	If that doesn’t say something about our employees and how happy they are, I don’t know what does.
571	Hallie Jackson	Senator Warren, you’ve been critical of Mayor Bloomberg on this issue.
572	Elizabeth Warren	Yes, I have.
573	Elizabeth Warren	I hope you’ve heard what his defense was, “I’ve been nice to some women.” That just doesn’t cut it.
574	Elizabeth Warren	The mayor has to stand on his record.
575	Elizabeth Warren	And what we need to know is exactly what’s lurking out there.
576	Elizabeth Warren	He has gotten some number of women … dozens?
577	Elizabeth Warren	Who knows … to sign nondisclosure agreements both for sexual harassment and for gender discrimination in the workplace.
578	Elizabeth Warren	So Mr. Mayor, are you willing to release all of those women from those nondisclosure agreements so we can hear their side of the story?
579	Michael Bloomberg	We have a very few nondisclosure agreements.
580	Elizabeth Warren	How many is that?
581	Michael Bloomberg	Let me finish.
582	Elizabeth Warren	How many is that?
583	Michael Bloomberg	None of them accused me of doing anything other than maybe they didn’t like a joke I told.
584	Michael Bloomberg	These would be agreements between two parties that wanted to keep it quiet and that’s up to them.
585	Michael Bloomberg	They signed those agreements and we’ll live with it.
586	Joe Biden	Come on.
587	Elizabeth Warren	So wait.
588	Elizabeth Warren	When you say a … I just want to be clear.
589	Elizabeth Warren	Some is how many?
590	Elizabeth Warren	And when you say they signed them and they wanted them, if they wish now to speak out and tell their side of the story about what it is they alleged, that’s now okay with you?
591	Elizabeth Warren	You’re releasing them on television tonight?
592	Michael Bloomberg	Senator, no.
593	Elizabeth Warren	Is that right?
594	Michael Bloomberg	Senator, the company and somebody else, in this … the man or a woman or could be more than that, they decided when they made an agreement that they wanted to keep it quiet for everybody’s interests.
595	Elizabeth Warren	No.
596	Joe Biden	Come on.
597	Michael Bloomberg	They sign the agreements and that’s what we’re going to live.
598	Pete Buttigieg	They could release them now.
599	Elizabeth Warren	I’m sorry.
600	Elizabeth Warren	No, the question is, are the women-
601	Michael Bloomberg	I heard your question.
602	Elizabeth Warren	… bound by being muzzled by you?
603	Elizabeth Warren	And you could release them from that immediately.
604	Elizabeth Warren	Because understand, this is not just a question of the mayor’s character.
605	Elizabeth Warren	This is also a question about electability.
606	Elizabeth Warren	We are not going to be Donald Trump with a man who has who knows how many nondisclosure agreements and the drip, drip, drip of stories of women saying they have been harassed and discriminated against.
607	Elizabeth Warren	That’s not what we do as Democrats.
608	Elizabeth Warren	… and discriminated against.
609	Elizabeth Warren	That’s not what we do as Democrats.
610	Hallie Jackson	Mr. Vice President.
611	Joe Biden	Look, let’s get something straight here.
612	Joe Biden	It’s easy, all the mayor has to do is say you are released from the non-disclosed agreement, period.
613	Joe Biden	We talk about transparency here.
614	Joe Biden	This guy got himself in trouble and he couldn’t disclose what he did, he went to his company.
615	Pete Buttigieg	To be super clear that was about the list of clients, so nobody gets the wrong idea.
616	Joe Biden	No, no, I’m sorry.
617	Pete Buttigieg	I know what you mean, no, you’re right.
618	Joe Biden	He went to the company and said, “I want to be released.
619	Joe Biden	I want to be able to do it.” Look, this is about transparency.
620	Joe Biden	From the very beginning, whether it’s your health record, whether it’s your taxes, whether you have cases against you, whether or not people have signed nondisclosure agreements.
621	Joe Biden	You think that women in fact were ready to say, “I don’t want anybody to know about what you did to me.” That’s not how it works.
622	Joe Biden	The way it works is they say, “Look, this is what you did to me.” And the mayor comes along and his attorney said, “I will give you this amount of money if you promise you’ll never say anything.” That’s how it works.
623	Hallie Jackson	Mayor Bloomberg, final word to you.
624	Michael Bloomberg	I’ve said, we’re not going to end these agreements because they were made consensually and they have every right to expect that they will stay private.
625	Joe Biden	If they want to release it, they should be able to release themselves.
626	Joe Biden	Say yes.
627	Bernie Sanders	You know, we talk about electability and everybody up here wants to beat Trump.
628	Bernie Sanders	And we talked about stop and frisk and [inaudible 00:45:32] has established and the problems there, but maybe we should also ask how Mayor Bloomberg in 2004 supported George W. Bush for president.
629	Bernie Sanders	Put money into Republican candidates for the United States Senate, when some of us, Joe and I and others were fighting for Democrats to control the United States Senate.
630	Joe Biden	[inaudible 00:45:51].
631	Bernie Sanders	Maybe we can talk about a billionaire saying that we should not raise the minimum wage or that we should cut social security, Medicare and Medicaid.
632	Bernie Sanders	If that’s a way to beat Donald Trump, wow, I would be very surprised.
633	Hallie Jackson	Thank you, Senator.
634	Hallie Jackson	Vanessa to you.
635	Michael Bloomberg	Wait, wait.
636	Vanessa Hauc	Senator Klobuchar, you’re running om your Washington experience.
637	Vanessa Hauc	But last week in a Telemundo interview, you could not name the President of Mexico or discuss any of his policies.
638	Vanessa Hauc	Last night you defended yourself saying, “This isn’t Jeopardy.” But my question to you is, shouldn’t our next president know more about one of our largest trading partners?
639	Amy Klobuchar	Of course.
640	Amy Klobuchar	Of course.
641	Amy Klobuchar	And I don’t think that that momentary forgetfulness actually reflects what I know about Mexico and how much I care about it.
642	Amy Klobuchar	And I first want to say greetings to President Lopez Obrador.
643	Amy Klobuchar	Secondly, what I meant the game of Jeopardy is that I think we could all come up with things.
644	Amy Klobuchar	You know how many members are there in the Israeli Knesset?
645	Amy Klobuchar	120. Who is the president of Honduras?
646	Vanessa Hauc	Senator Klobuchar.
647	Amy Klobuchar	Hernandez.
648	Vanessa Hauc	Senator Klobuchar.
649	Amy Klobuchar	When it comes to Mexico, I am the one person on this stage that came out first to say I was for the U.S. Mexican Canadian trade agreement.
650	Amy Klobuchar	That is going to be one of the number one duties of a president is to implement that.
651	Vanessa Hauc	Senator Klobuchar, my colleague specifically asked you if you could name the President of Mexico and your response was no.
652	Amy Klobuchar	Yes, that’s right.
653	Amy Klobuchar	And I said that I made an error.
654	Amy Klobuchar	I think having a president that maybe is humble and is able to admit that here and there, maybe wouldn’t be a bad thing.
655	Vanessa Hauc	Mayor Buttigieg, your response [crosstalk 00:47:46].
656	Pete Buttigieg	Yeah, look, I wouldn’t liken this to trivia.
657	Pete Buttigieg	I’m actually didn’t know how many members were in the Knesset.
658	Pete Buttigieg	So you got me there.
659	Amy Klobuchar	Well, there you go.
660	Pete Buttigieg	But you’re staking your candidacy on your Washington experience.
661	Pete Buttigieg	You’re on the committee that oversees border security.
662	Pete Buttigieg	You’re on the committee that does trade.
663	Pete Buttigieg	You’re literally part of the committee that’s overseeing these things and we’re not able to speak to literally the first thing about the politics of the country to our south.
664	Amy Klobuchar	Are you trying to say that I’m dumb?
665	Amy Klobuchar	Are you mocking me here, Pete?
666	Pete Buttigieg	I’m saying you shouldn’t trivialize that knowledge.
667	Amy Klobuchar	I said I made an error.
668	Amy Klobuchar	People sometimes forget names.
669	Amy Klobuchar	I am the one that has, number one, has the experience based on passing over 100 bills-
670	Vanessa Hauc	Thank you, Senator.
671	Amy Klobuchar	If I could respond, this was a pretty big allegation.
672	Vanessa Hauc	Quickly, please.
673	Amy Klobuchar	He’s basically saying that I don’t have the experience to be President of the United States.
674	Amy Klobuchar	I have passed over 100 bills as the lead Democrat since being in the U.S. Senate.
675	Amy Klobuchar	I am the one, not you, that has won statewide in congressional district after congressional district.
676	Amy Klobuchar	And I will say when you tried in Indiana, Pete, to run, what happened to you?
677	Amy Klobuchar	You lost by over 20 points to someone who later lost to my friend Joe Donnelly.
678	Amy Klobuchar	So don’t tell me about experience.
679	Amy Klobuchar	What unites us here is we want to win and I think we should put a proven winner in charge of the ticket.
680	Vanessa Hauc	Your response, Mayor Buttigieg.
681	Pete Buttigieg	This is the race for president.
682	Pete Buttigieg	If winning a race for Senate in Minnesota translated directly to becoming president, I would have grown up under the presidency of Walter Mondale.
683	Pete Buttigieg	This is different.
684	Pete Buttigieg	And the reason that I think we need to talk about Washington experience is that we should ask what that experience has led to.
685	Pete Buttigieg	Experiences and certainly tenure is not always the same thing as judgment.
686	Pete Buttigieg	If we’re going to talk about votes in the Senate in Washington, let’s talk [crosstalk 00:49:38].
687	Lester Holt	Hello, hello, hello.
688	Lester Holt	Thank you.
689	Lester Holt	[crosstalk 00:49:46] Senator Warren and Mayor Bloomberg, this question is for you.
690	Lester Holt	I want to talk about and maybe this is appropriate here.
691	Elizabeth Warren	Can I just defend Senator Klobuchar for a minute?
692	Elizabeth Warren	This is not right.
693	Elizabeth Warren	I understand that she forgot a name.
694	Elizabeth Warren	It happens.
695	Elizabeth Warren	It happens to everybody on this stage.
696	Elizabeth Warren	Look, you want to ask about whether or not you understand trade policy with Mexico, have at it, and if you get it wrong, man, you ought to be held accountable for that.
697	Elizabeth Warren	You want to ask about the economy and you get it wrong, you ought to be held accountable.
698	Elizabeth Warren	You want to ask about a thousand different issues and you get it wrong, you ought to be held accountable.
699	Elizabeth Warren	But let’s just be clear, missing a name all by itself does not indicate that you do not understand what’s going on.
700	Elizabeth Warren	And I just think this is unfair.
701	Elizabeth Warren	[crosstalk 00:06:42].
702	Vanessa Hauc	Senator Warren, you’re right but Senator Klobuchar could not discuss Mexican policy either.
703	Elizabeth Warren	Fair enough.
704	Joe Biden	I’m the only one who knows this man and met with him.
705	Amy Klobuchar	I do have to respond.
706	Joe Biden	Come on, man.
707	Amy Klobuchar	[crosstalk 00:50:55] You have just invoked my name again and I ask you to look at the interview I did directly after the forum, which we went into great detail on Latin American policy.
708	Amy Klobuchar	And I want to say one thing about Mayor Pete where we just disagree, he was asked on a debate stage about the Mexican cartels, which are bad, bad criminal organizations.
709	Amy Klobuchar	He said that he would be open to classifying them as terrorist organizations.
710	Amy Klobuchar	I actually don’t agree with that.
711	Amy Klobuchar	That is a very valid debate to have.
712	Amy Klobuchar	I don’t think that would be good for our security coordination with Mexico.
713	Amy Klobuchar	And I think you got that wrong [crosstalk 00:51:35].
714	Joe Biden	I’ve spent more time in Mexico than anybody.
715	Joe Biden	Can I get a chance to say something?
716	Pete Buttigieg	Hold on.
717	Bernie Sanders	Si.
718	Joe Biden	Si, thank you.
719	Joe Biden	Look, I’m the only who spent extensive, hundreds of hours in Latin America.
720	Joe Biden	I’ve met with this president, I’ve met with the last president, the one before-
721	Jon Ralston	So, you all ready to play some Nevada trivia now?
722	Jon Ralston	I’m only half joking here.
723	Jon Ralston	Let’s talk about this issue because it’s up there and polls, voters are really concerned about it as you all know.
724	Jon Ralston	What you might not know is that Las Vegas and Reno are the vibrant economic engines for the state of Nevada and are also two of the fastest warming cities in the country.
725	Jon Ralston	In certain months of the year, the heat is already an emergency situation for residents and for tourists walking up and down the strip.
726	Jon Ralston	So I’m going to start with you, Mr. Vice President, what specific policies would you implement that would keep Las Vegas and Reno livable but also not hurt those economies?
727	Joe Biden	It is the existential threat that humanity faces, global warming.
728	Joe Biden	I went out to check and you have a facility where you have the one of the largest, largest solar panel arrays in the world.
729	Joe Biden	And when the fourth stage is completed, you’ll be able to take care of 60,000 homes for every single bit of their needs.
730	Joe Biden	And what I would do is number one, work on providing the $47 billion we have for tech and to making sure we find answers is to provide a way to transmit that wind and solar energy across the network of all the United States.
731	Joe Biden	Invest in battery technology.
732	Joe Biden	I would immediately restate all of the elimination of what Trump has eliminated in terms of EPA.
733	Joe Biden	I would secondly make sure that we had 500,000 new charging stations in every new highway we built in the United States of America or repaired.
734	Joe Biden	I would make sure that we, once again, made sure that we got the mileage standards back up, which would have saved over 12 billion barrels of oil had he not walked away from it.
735	Joe Biden	And I would invest in rail, in rail.
736	Joe Biden	Rail can take hundreds of thousands, millions of cars off the road if we have high speed rail.
737	Jon Ralston	Thank you Mr. Vice President.
738	Jon Ralston	I want to get some of the rest of you in on this because y’all have plans.
739	Jon Ralston	Mayor Bloomberg, let me read what you said about this issue.
740	Jon Ralston	You said you want to intensify U.S. and international actions to stop the expansion of coal.
741	Jon Ralston	How exactly are you going to do that?
742	Michael Bloomberg	Well, already we’ve closed 304 out of the 530 coal-fired power plants in the United States.
743	Michael Bloomberg	And we’ve closed 80 out of the 200 or 300 that are in Europe.
744	Michael Bloomberg	Bloomberg Philanthropies working with the Sierra club.
745	Michael Bloomberg	That’s one of the things you do.
746	Michael Bloomberg	But just let’s start at the beginning.
747	Michael Bloomberg	If you’re president, the first thing you do the first day is you rejoin the Paris Agreement.
748	Michael Bloomberg	This is just ridiculous for us to drop out.
749	Michael Bloomberg	Two, America’s responsibility is to be the leader in the world and if we don’t, we’re the ones that are going to get hurt just as much as anybody else.
750	Michael Bloomberg	And that’s why I don’t want to have us cut off our relationships with China because you will never solve this problem without China and India, Western Europe and America.
751	Michael Bloomberg	That’s for most of the [crosstalk 00:54:50].
752	Michael Bloomberg	Let me just finish one other thing.
753	Michael Bloomberg	I believe, and you can tell me whether this is right, but the solar array that the vice president was talking about is being closed because it’s not economic.
754	Michael Bloomberg	That you can put solar panels in and modern technology, even more modern than that.
755	Jon Ralston	Mayor, I want to let Senator Warren jump in here.
756	Jon Ralston	Just because you’ve said something that’s really specific to Nevada.
757	Jon Ralston	The tension here in this state is between people want renewable energy and people want conservation on public lands.
758	Jon Ralston	85% of Nevada is managed by the federal government.
759	Jon Ralston	You have said that you are going to have an executive order that would stop drilling on public lands, stop mining, which is a huge industry here.
760	Jon Ralston	You got to have lithium, you got to have copper for renewable energy.
761	Jon Ralston	How do you do that?
762	Elizabeth Warren	So look, I think we should stop all new drilling and mining on public lands and all offshore drilling.
763	Elizabeth Warren	If we need to make exceptions because there are specific minerals that we’ve got to have access to, then we locate those and we do it not in a way that just is about the profits of giant industries, but in a way that is sustainable for the environment.
764	Elizabeth Warren	We cannot continue to let our public lands be used for profits by those who don’t care about our environment and are not making it better.
765	Elizabeth Warren	Look, I’m going to say something that is really controversial in Washington, but I think I’m safe to say this here in Nevada.
766	Elizabeth Warren	I believe in science and I believe that the way we’re going to deal with this problem, is that we are going to increase by 10 fold our investment in science.
767	Elizabeth Warren	There’s an upcoming $27 trillion market worldwide for green and much of what is needed has not yet been invented.
768	Elizabeth Warren	My proposal is let’s invent it here in the United States and then say we invent in the U.S., you’ve got to build it in the U.S. That’s a million new manufacturing-
769	Chuck Todd	We’re going to stick to this topic but Senator Sanders, I’m going to move to fracking.
770	Chuck Todd	You want a total ban on natural gas extraction, fracking in the next five years.
771	Chuck Todd	The industry obviously supports a lot of jobs around the country, including thousands in the battleground state of Pennsylvania.
772	Chuck Todd	One union official there told the New York Times, “If we end up with a Democratic candidate that supports a fracking ban, I’m going to tell my members that either you don’t vote or you vote for the other guy.” What do you tell these workers?
773	Chuck Todd	It’s supporting a big industry right now, sir.
774	Bernie Sanders	What I tell these workers is that the scientists are telling us, that if we don’t act incredibly boldly within the next six, seven years, there will be irreparable damage done, not just in Nevada, not just to Vermont or Massachusetts, but to the entire world.
775	Bernie Sanders	Joe said it right, this is an existential threat.
776	Bernie Sanders	You know what that means, Chuck?
777	Bernie Sanders	That means we’re fighting for the future of this planet.
778	Bernie Sanders	And the Green New Deal that I support, by the way, will create up to 20 million good paying jobs as we move our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.
779	Bernie Sanders	This is a moral issue, my friends.
780	Bernie Sanders	We have to take the responsibility of making sure that the planet we leave our children and grandchildren is a planet that is healthy and habitable.
781	Bernie Sanders	That is more important than the profits of the fossil fuel industry.
782	Chuck Todd	I want to keep this going.
783	Chuck Todd	Senator Klobuchar, you’re not on the same page at a total ban of fracking.
784	Chuck Todd	You call it a transitional fuel, but scientists are sounding this alarm now.
785	Chuck Todd	Do you take these warnings that maybe fracking as a step backwards, not a step forward, not a transition.
786	Amy Klobuchar	I made it very clear that we have to review all of the permits that are out there right now for natural gas and then make decisions on each one them and then not grant new ones until we make sure that it’s safe but it is a transitional fuel.
787	Amy Klobuchar	And I want to add something that really hasn’t been brought up by my colleagues.
788	Amy Klobuchar	This is a crisis and a lot of our plans are very similar to get to carbon neutral by 2045, 2050 something like that.
789	Amy Klobuchar	But we’re not going to be able to pass this unless we bring people with us.
790	Amy Klobuchar	I’m looking at these incredible senators from Nevada, Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen and I’m thinking that they know how important this is and you can do this in a smart way.
791	Amy Klobuchar	One, get back into that international climate change agreement.
792	Amy Klobuchar	Two, clean power rules, bring those back.
793	Amy Klobuchar	A president can do this herself without Congress as well as the gas mileage standards.
794	Amy Klobuchar	But when it comes to putting a sweep, a price on carbon … This is very important, Chuck.
795	Amy Klobuchar	We have to make sure that that money goes back directly as dividends to the people that are going to need help for paying their bills.
796	Amy Klobuchar	Otherwise, we’re not going to pass it.
797	Amy Klobuchar	So there has to be a heart to the policy to get this done.
798	Chuck Todd	Senator Warren, address the worker issue, if you don’t mind, as well.
799	Chuck Todd	Can you address the worker issue?
800	Elizabeth Warren	Yes, we can have a Green New Deal and create jobs.
801	Elizabeth Warren	We need people in infrastructure who will help build.
802	Elizabeth Warren	We have manufacturing-
803	Chuck Todd	They could lose that job tomorrow though.
804	Chuck Todd	That’s what they’re concerned about.
805	Elizabeth Warren	Yes, those jobs are for tomorrow.
806	Elizabeth Warren	Those are the ones we need to be working on to harden our infrastructure right now.
807	Elizabeth Warren	But listen to Senator Klobuchar’s point.
808	Elizabeth Warren	She says we have to think smaller in order to get it passed.
809	Elizabeth Warren	I don’t think that’s the right approach here.
810	Elizabeth Warren	Why can’t we get anything passed in Washington on climate?
811	Elizabeth Warren	Everyone understands the urgency, but we’ve got two problems.
812	Elizabeth Warren	The first is corruption, an industry that makes its money felt all through Washington.
813	Elizabeth Warren	The first thing I want to do in Washington is pass my anti-corruption bill so that we can start making the changes we need to make on climate.
814	Elizabeth Warren	And the second is the filibuster.
815	Elizabeth Warren	If you’re not willing to roll back the filibuster, then you’re giving the fossil fuel industry a veto over all of the work that we need to do.
816	Chuck Todd	Senator, thank you, Vanessa’s got the next question.
817	Amy Klobuchar	Can I respond, she [crosstalk 01:00:57].
818	Vanessa Hauc	Vice President Biden, you have said that you want to hold the oil and gas executives accountable for their role in harming our planet.
819	Vanessa Hauc	You have even suggested that you might put them in jail.
820	Vanessa Hauc	Which companies are you talking about and how far are you willing to go?
821	Joe Biden	I’m willing to go as far as we have to.
822	Joe Biden	First of all, I would eliminate all the subsidies we have for oil and gas, eliminate it, period.
823	Joe Biden	That would save millions and millions, billions of dollars.
824	Joe Biden	Number two, I think that any executive who was engaged in … and by the way, minority communities are the communities that would be most badly hurt by the way in which we deal with climate change.
825	Joe Biden	They are the ones that become the victims.
826	Joe Biden	That’s where the asthma is.
827	Joe Biden	That’s where the groundwater supply has been polluted.
828	Joe Biden	That’s where in fact, people in fact do not have the opportunity to be able to get away from, everything from, still asbestos in the walls of our schools.
829	Joe Biden	I have a trillion dollar program for infrastructure.
830	Joe Biden	That will provide for thousands and thousands of new jobs, not $15 an hour, but $50 an hour plus benefits.
831	Joe Biden	Unions, unions, being able to do that.
832	Joe Biden	And what it does is it will change the nature … Look, here’s the last point, my time’s going to run out.
833	Joe Biden	Here’s the last point I want to make to you.
834	Joe Biden	On day one when I’m elected president, I’m going to invite all of the members of the Paris Accord to Washington D.C.
835	Joe Biden	They make up 85% of the problem.
836	Joe Biden	They know me, I’m used to dealing with international relations.
837	Joe Biden	I will get them to up the ante in a big way.
838	Vanessa Hauc	Vice President Biden, you didn’t answer to my questions.
839	Joe Biden	I thought I did.
840	Vanessa Hauc	What would you do with these companies that are responsible for the destruction of our planet?
841	Joe Biden	What would I do with them?
842	Joe Biden	I would make sure they, number one, stop.
843	Joe Biden	Number two, if you demonstrate that they in fact have done things already that are bad and they’ve been lying, they should be able to be sued.
844	Joe Biden	They should be able to be held personally accountable and they should … not only, not only the company, not the stock holders, but the CEOs of those companies.
845	Joe Biden	They should be engaged.
846	Joe Biden	And it’s a little bit like, look, this is the industry we should be able to sue.
847	Joe Biden	We should go after just like we did the drug companies, just like we did with the tobacco companies.
848	Joe Biden	The only company we can’t go after our gun manufacturers because of my buddy here, but that’s a different-
849	Vanessa Hauc	Thank you, Vice President.
850	Lester Holt	We’re going to stay on the topic.
851	Lester Holt	My question is to Mayor Bloomberg, Mayor Bloomberg, your business is heavily invested in China.
852	Lester Holt	I think you mentioned that a few questions back, the number one producer in the world of carbon emissions.
853	Lester Holt	How far would you go to force China to reduce those emissions and tackle the climate crisis?
854	Michael Bloomberg	Well, you’re not going to go to war with them.
855	Michael Bloomberg	You have to negotiate with them and try to … and we’ve seen how well that works with tariffs that are hurting us.
856	Michael Bloomberg	What you have to do is convince the Chinese that is in their interest as well.
857	Michael Bloomberg	Their people are going to die just as our people are going to die and we work together.
858	Michael Bloomberg	In all fairness, the Chinese have slowed down.
859	Michael Bloomberg	It’s India that is even bigger problem, but it is an enormous problem, nobody’s doing anything about it.
860	Michael Bloomberg	We could right here in America make a big difference.
861	Michael Bloomberg	We’re closing the coal-fired power plants.
862	Michael Bloomberg	If we enforced some of the rules on fracking so that they don’t release methane into the air and into the water, you’ll make a big difference.
863	Michael Bloomberg	But we’re not going to get rid of fracking for while and we frack incidentally not just natural gas, you frack oil as well.
864	Michael Bloomberg	It is a technique and when it’s done poorly, like they’re doing it in too many places where the methane gets out into the air, it is very damaging.
865	Michael Bloomberg	But it’s a transition fuel, I think the Senator said it right.
866	Michael Bloomberg	We want to go to all renewables, but that’s still many years from now.
867	Michael Bloomberg	And before, I think the Senator mentioned 2050 for some data.
868	Michael Bloomberg	No scientist thinks the numbers for 2050 or 2050 anymore.
869	Michael Bloomberg	They’re 2040, 2035.
870	Michael Bloomberg	The world is coming apart faster than any scientific study had predicted.
871	Michael Bloomberg	We just got to do something now [crosstalk 01:04:46].
872	Lester Holt	Mayor Buttigieg, your thoughts.
873	Pete Buttigieg	Let’s be real about the deadline.
874	Pete Buttigieg	It’s not 2050.
875	Pete Buttigieg	It’s not 2040.
876	Pete Buttigieg	It’s not 2030.
877	Pete Buttigieg	It’s 2020, because if we don’t elect a president who actually believes in climate science now, we will never meet any of the other scientific or policy deadlines that we need to.
878	Pete Buttigieg	So first of all, let’s make sure we’re actually positioned to win.
879	Pete Buttigieg	Which once again, if we put forward two of the most polarizing figures on this stage as the only option, it’s going to be a real struggle.
880	Pete Buttigieg	Now I’ve got a plan to get us carbon neutral by 2050.
881	Pete Buttigieg	And I think everybody up here has a plan that more or less does the same.
882	Pete Buttigieg	So the real question is how are we going to actually get it done?
883	Pete Buttigieg	We need leadership to make this a national project that breaks down the partisan and political tug of war that prevents anything from getting done.
884	Pete Buttigieg	How do you do it?
885	Pete Buttigieg	Well, first of all, making sure that those jobs are available quickly.
886	Pete Buttigieg	Secondly, ensuring that we are pulling in those very sectors who have been made to feel like they’re part of the problem, from farming to industry, and fund as well as urge them to do the right thing.
887	Pete Buttigieg	And then global climate diplomacy, I’m a little skeptical of the idea that convincing is going to do the trick when it comes to working with China.
888	Pete Buttigieg	America has repeatedly overestimated our ability to shape Chinese ambitions, but what we can do is ensure that we use the hard tools [crosstalk 00:01:46].
889	Chuck Todd	Hold here for a second.
890	Chuck Todd	Senator Warren?
891	Pete Buttigieg	-policy, to enforce what has to happen.
892	Elizabeth Warren	Yes.
893	Elizabeth Warren	I want to make sure that the question of environmental justice gets more than a glancing blow in this debate, because for generations now in this country, toxic waste dumps, polluting factories have been located in or near communities of color over and over and over.
894	Elizabeth Warren	And the consequences are felt in the health of young African American babies.
895	Elizabeth Warren	It’s felt in the health of seniors, people with compromised immune systems.
896	Elizabeth Warren	It’s also felt economically.
897	Elizabeth Warren	Who wants to move into an area where the air smells bad or you can’t drink the water.
898	Elizabeth Warren	I have a commitment of $1 trillion to repair the damage that this nation has permitted to inflict on communities of color for generations now.
899	Elizabeth Warren	We have to own up to our responsibility.
900	Elizabeth Warren	We cannot simply talk about climate change in big global terms.
901	Elizabeth Warren	We need to talk about it in terms of rescuing the communities that have been damaged.
902	Chuck Todd	Senator Warren, thank you.
903	Chuck Todd	[crosstalk 00:02:53].
904	Helen	I want to ask you about something else that is important to people here.
905	Helen	I want to ask you about Latinos owning one out of every four new businesses in the, United States, many of them have benefited from president Trump’s tax cuts, and they may be hesitant about new taxes or regulations.
906	Helen	Will taxes on their small businesses go up under your administration?
907	Joe Biden	No.
908	Joe Biden	Taxes and small [inaudible 00:03:15], matter of fact, we’re going to make sure there’s more money available for small businesses in the Latino community, in the black community, to be able to get the capital to start businesses.
909	Joe Biden	At the Treasury Department, there’s going to be a window available where we significantly increase the amount of money available so people can borrow the money to get started.
910	Joe Biden	They have demonstrated they’re incredibly successful.
911	Joe Biden	We should not be raising taxes on them.
912	Joe Biden	We should start rewarding work, not just wealth.
913	Joe Biden	That’s why we have to change the tax code the way it is.
914	Joe Biden	That’s why the wealthy have to start to pay their fair share.
915	Joe Biden	And that’s why we have to focus on giving people the ability to garner wealth, generate wealth.
916	Joe Biden	And that’s why this whole idea of red lining, lending to people in areas, wasn’t the cause of Wall Street failing.
917	Joe Biden	The greed of Wall Street was the reason why it occurred, not the red lining.
918	Joe Biden	And lastly, I want to say, look, the idea of China, China is and their Belt and Road proposal, they’re taking the dirtiest coal in the world, mostly out of Mongolia, and spreading it around the world.
919	Joe Biden	It’s clear.
920	Joe Biden	Make it clear when you call them to Washington in the first 100 days, “If you continue, you will suffer severe consequences because the rest of the world will impose tariffs on everything you’re selling because you are undercutting the entire economy.”
921	Helen	Thank you Mr. Vice President.
922	Helen	Mayor Buttigieg, will taxes on those businesses go up under you?
923	Pete Buttigieg	Not if they are small businesses.
924	Pete Buttigieg	I mean what we’ve got to do is level the playing field, where a company like Amazon or Chevron is paying literally zero on billions of dollars in profits.
925	Pete Buttigieg	And it puts small businesses like the ones that are revitalizing my own city, often Latino owned on our West side, at a disadvantage.
926	Pete Buttigieg	We need to recognize that investing in Latino entrepreneurship is not just an investment in the Latino community.
927	Pete Buttigieg	It is an investment in the future of America.
928	Pete Buttigieg	And it is time for a President who understands the value of immigration in lifting up all of our communities and our country.
929	Pete Buttigieg	We are getting the exact opposite message from the current president.
930	Pete Buttigieg	And it is time to recognize not just the diversity of the Latino community but the importance of issues like economic empowerment, healthcare, as well as [crosstalk 00:05:23].
931	Elizabeth Warren	We have an entrepreneurship gap in America.
932	Elizabeth Warren	And that is a gap between white entrepreneurs and black and Latino entrepreneurs.
933	Elizabeth Warren	And the principle reason for this is they don’t have the money for equity to get the businesses started.
934	Elizabeth Warren	It’s about a $7 billion gap.
935	Elizabeth Warren	We want to have real entrepreneurship and a level playing field.
936	Elizabeth Warren	I have a plan to put the $7 billion in to have the fund managed by the people who are routinely cut out.
937	Elizabeth Warren	It can’t just be about taxes.
938	Helen	Thank you Senator.
939	Elizabeth Warren	We need to make an investment to level the playing field.
940	Elizabeth Warren	And in the black [crosstalk 00:06:06].
941	Chuck Todd	Excuse me.
942	Chuck Todd	I want to get at something.
943	Chuck Todd	Mayor Bloomberg, the Vice President talked about red lining-
944	Michael Bloomberg	I’m the only one here that’s started a business.
945	Chuck Todd	Mayor Bloomberg, you seem to imply that red lining and stopping red lining has somehow contributed to the financial crisis.
946	Michael Bloomberg	No.
947	Michael Bloomberg	That’s exactly wrong.
948	Chuck Todd	And that was the implication that came out in the quote.
949	Chuck Todd	So I want to give you a chance to clarify this.
950	Michael Bloomberg	Well on the record against red lining, since I worked on Wall Street.
951	Michael Bloomberg	I was against it during the financial crisis.
952	Michael Bloomberg	I’ve been against it since the financial crisis came about because the people that took the mortgages packaged them and other people bought them.
953	Michael Bloomberg	That was where all the disaster was.
954	Michael Bloomberg	Red lining is still a practice some places and we’ve got to cut it out, but it’s just not true.
955	Michael Bloomberg	What I was going to say, maybe you want to talk about businesses.
956	Michael Bloomberg	I’m the only one here I think that’s ever started a business.
957	Michael Bloomberg	Is that fair?
958	Michael Bloomberg	Okay.
959	Michael Bloomberg	What do we need is, I can tell you in New York City we had programs.
960	Michael Bloomberg	There are mentoring programs for the young business people so they can learn how to start a business.
961	Michael Bloomberg	We had programs that could get them seed capital.
962	Michael Bloomberg	We have programs to get branch banking in their neighborhoods, because if you don’t have a branch bank there, you can’t get a checking account, can’t get a checking account, you can’t get a loan.
963	Michael Bloomberg	You can’t get a loan, you can’t get a mortgage.
964	Michael Bloomberg	Then you don’t have any wealth.
965	Michael Bloomberg	There’s ways to fix this and it doesn’t take trillions of dollars.
966	Michael Bloomberg	It takes us to focus on the problems of small business.
967	Chuck Todd	Senator Sanders, 45 seconds, then we’re going to move on.
968	Chuck Todd	Senator Sanders, 45 seconds.
969	Bernie Sanders	All right.
970	Bernie Sanders	When we talk about a corrupt political system bought by billionaires like Mr. Bloomberg, it manifests itself in a tax code in which not only is Amazon and many other major corporations, some owned by the wealthiest people in this country, not paying a nickel in taxes, we have the insane situation that billionaires today, if you can believe it, have an effective tax rate lower than the middle-class.
971	Bernie Sanders	So maybe just-
972	Michael Bloomberg	Senator, you’re writing the tax code.
973	Michael Bloomberg	Why are you complaining?
974	Michael Bloomberg	Who wrote the code?
975	Bernie Sanders	You did, you and your campaign contributions.
976	Michael Bloomberg	You and the other 99 Senators.
977	Bernie Sanders	Not me.
978	Bernie Sanders	You and your campaign contributions are electing people to represent the wealthy and the powerful.
979	Michael Bloomberg	Yes, those are the Democrats, thank you.
980	Bernie Sanders	Well, and Republicans too, and George W. Bush as well.
981	Chuck Todd	Senator Klobuchar, let me address-
982	Amy Klobuchar	I was just, I was thinking there was going to be a rematch on Saturday in Vegas and those guys should go down there.
983	Chuck Todd	Senator Klobuchar, I actually want to get you to something about Senator Sanders tweeted last year, “Billionaires should not exist.” What say you?
984	Amy Klobuchar	Okay.
985	Amy Klobuchar	I believe in capitalism.
986	Amy Klobuchar	But I think the goal of someone in government and a President of the United States should be a check on that.
987	Amy Klobuchar	I’m not going to limit what people make, but I think right now our tax code is so tilted against regular people and that is what’s wrong.
988	Amy Klobuchar	I was thinking of your question about small businesses.
989	Amy Klobuchar	The small businesses I talked to, they have trouble getting employees because their employees don’t have childcare.
990	Amy Klobuchar	We should have universal childcare.
991	Amy Klobuchar	And we have not been talking enough about Donald Trump and let’s just talk about Donald Trump because he signed that tax bill that helped the wealthy.
992	Amy Klobuchar	And he went down Mar-a-Lago and he said to all his friends, “You just got a lot richer.” That is Exhibit A.
993	Amy Klobuchar	And I can tell you the hardworking people in Nevada, were not in that room.
994	Amy Klobuchar	So the key to me is to not limit what people can make, but make sure that we have a government that is fair for everyone.
995	Chuck Todd	So Senator Sanders, what did you mean that you don’t think they should exist.
996	Chuck Todd	What did that mean?
997	Bernie Sanders	I’ll tell you what I mean.
998	Bernie Sanders	We have a grotesque and immoral distribution of wealth income.
999	Bernie Sanders	Mike Bloomberg owns more wealth than the bottom 125 million Americans.
1000	Bernie Sanders	That’s wrong.
1001	Bernie Sanders	That’s immoral.
1002	Bernie Sanders	That should not be the case when we got a half a million people sleeping out on the streets, where we have kids who cannot afford to go to college, when we have 45 million people dealing with student debt.
1003	Bernie Sanders	We have enormous problems facing this country and we cannot continue seeing a situation where in the last three years, billionaires in this country saw an $850 billion increase in their wealth.
1004	Bernie Sanders	Congratulations, Mr. Bloomberg.
1005	Bernie Sanders	But the average American last year saw less than a 1% increase in his or her income.
1006	Bernie Sanders	That’s wrong.
1007	Chuck Todd	Mayor Bloomberg, should you exist?
1008	Michael Bloomberg	I can’t speak for all billionaires.
1009	Michael Bloomberg	All I know is I’ve been very lucky, made a lot of money and I’m giving it all away to make this country better.
1010	Michael Bloomberg	And a good chunk of it goes to the Democratic Party as well.
1011	Chuck Todd	Is it too much?
1012	Chuck Todd	Have you earned too much money?
1013	Chuck Todd	Has it been an obscene amount of … should you have earned that much money?
1014	Michael Bloomberg	Yes.
1015	Michael Bloomberg	I worked very hard for it.
1016	Michael Bloomberg	And I’m giving it away.
1017	Chuck Todd	Thank you.
1018	Chuck Todd	Helen.
1019	Helen	Mayor, Senator Sanders has a proposal that will require all large companies to turn over up to 20% of their ownership to employees over time.
1020	Helen	Is that a good idea?
1021	Pete Buttigieg	I think that employee ownership of companies is a great idea.
1022	Pete Buttigieg	I’m not sure it makes sense to command those companies to do it.
1023	Pete Buttigieg	If we really want to deliver less inequality in this country, then we’ve got to start with the tax code.
1024	Pete Buttigieg	And we’ve got to start with investments in how people are able to live the American dream, which is in serious, serious decline.
1025	Pete Buttigieg	Matter of fact, last time I checked the list of countries to live out the American dream, in other words, to be born at the bottom and come out at the top, we’re not even in the top 10 number.
1026	Pete Buttigieg	Number one place to live out the American dream right now is Denmark.
1027	Pete Buttigieg	And as the, I think, the lone person on this stage who’s not a millionaire, let alone a billionaire, I believe that part of what needs to change is for the voices of the communities that haven’t felt heard on Wall Street or in Washington to actually be brought to Capitol Hill.
1028	Pete Buttigieg	It’s why I am building a politics designed around inclusion, designed around belonging, because the one thing that will definitely perpetuate the income inequality we’re living with right now is for Donald Trump to be reelected because we polarize this country with the wrong nominees.
1029	Helen	Senator Sanders, it’s your policy.
1030	Bernie Sanders	That’s me, right?
1031	Helen	It is your policy.
1032	Bernie Sanders	Thank you.
1033	Bernie Sanders	It is my policy and I’m very proud of that policy.
1034	Bernie Sanders	What we need to do to deal with this grotesque level of income and wealth inequality is make sure that those people who are working, you know what Mr. Bloomberg?
1035	Bernie Sanders	It wasn’t you who made all that money.
1036	Bernie Sanders	Maybe your workers played some role in that as well.
1037	Bernie Sanders	And it is important that those workers are able to share the benefits also.
1038	Bernie Sanders	When we have so many people go to work every day and they feel not good about their jobs, they feel like cogs in a machine.
1039	Bernie Sanders	I want workers to be able to sit on corporate boards as well, so they can have some say of what happens to their lives.
1040	Helen	Mayor Bloomberg, you own a large company.
1041	Helen	Would you support what Senator Sanders is proposing?
1042	Michael Bloomberg	Absolutely not.
1043	Michael Bloomberg	I can’t think of a way that would make it easier for Donald Trump to get reelected than listening to this conversation.
1044	Michael Bloomberg	This is ridiculous.
1045	Michael Bloomberg	We’re not going to throw out capitalism.
1046	Michael Bloomberg	We tried that.
1047	Michael Bloomberg	Other countries tried that.
1048	Michael Bloomberg	It was called communism and it just didn’t work.
1049	Elizabeth Warren	So let me make a proposal that will work, that has not only support from a majority of Democrats, but also from a majority of the independents and a majority of Republicans.
1050	Elizabeth Warren	And that is a two cent wealth tax on all fortunes above $50 million.
1051	Elizabeth Warren	You hit a billion, you’ve got to pay a few pennies more.
1052	Elizabeth Warren	This is a tax on the top 1/10th of 1% in America.
1053	Elizabeth Warren	And it permits us to start to restructure our economy.
1054	Elizabeth Warren	It means we can afford universal childcare for every baby in this country, age zero to five.
1055	Elizabeth Warren	It means we can have universal pre-K for every child in America.
1056	Elizabeth Warren	It means we can raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher and stop exploiting the black and brown women who do this work.
1057	Elizabeth Warren	It means we can put $800 billion into our public schools, quadruple funding for Title One schools.
1058	Elizabeth Warren	And as a former special education teacher, we could fully fund IDEA so children with disabilities would get the full education they need.
1059	Elizabeth Warren	We can do college.
1060	Elizabeth Warren	We can put $50 billion dollars into our historically black colleges and universities.
1061	Elizabeth Warren	And we could cancel student loan debt for 43 million Americans.
1062	Elizabeth Warren	That’s something a majority of Americans support, a two cent wealth tax.
1063	Elizabeth Warren	It is a question of values.
1064	Elizabeth Warren	Do we want to invest in Mr. Bloomberg or do we want to invest in an entire generation?
1065	Chuck Todd	Senator Sanders, my next question is for you.
1066	Chuck Todd	Senator Sanders, our latest NBC News, Wall Street Journal poll released yesterday.
1067	Chuck Todd	Two thirds of all voters said they were uncomfortable with a socialist candidate for President.
1068	Chuck Todd	What do you say to those voters, sir?
1069	Bernie Sanders	What was the result of that poll?
1070	Bernie Sanders	Who was winning?
1071	Chuck Todd	The questions to you.
1072	Bernie Sanders	Well, the question was that I was winning and I think by a fairly comfortable margin.
1073	Bernie Sanders	You might mention that.
1074	Bernie Sanders	But here is the point.
1075	Bernie Sanders	Let’s talk about democratic socialism, not communism Mr. Bloomberg, that’s a cheap shot.
1076	Bernie Sanders	Let’s talk about democratic.
1077	Bernie Sanders	Let’s talk about what goes on in countries like Denmark, where Pete correctly pointed out, they have a much higher quality of life in many respects than we do.
1078	Bernie Sanders	What are we talking about?
1079	Bernie Sanders	We are living in many ways in a socialist society right now.
1080	Bernie Sanders	Problem is, as Dr. Martin Luther King reminded us, we have socialism for the very rich, rugged individualism for the poor.
1081	Michael Bloomberg	Wait a second.
1082	Bernie Sanders	Let me finish.
1083	Bernie Sanders	When Donald Trump gets $800 million in tax breaks and subsidies to build luxury condominiums, that’s socialism for the rich.
1084	Bernie Sanders	Walmart, we have to subsidize Walmart’s workers who are on Medicaid and food stamps because the wealthiest family in America pays starvation wages, that’s socialism for the rich.
1085	Bernie Sanders	I believe in democratic socialism for working people, not billionaires, health care for all, and educational opportunities for all.
1086	Chuck Todd	Senator, thank you.
1087	Chuck Todd	Mayor Bloomberg, would you like to- [crosstalk 00:16:41].
1088	Bernie Sanders	Creating a government to works [crosstalk 00:16:44] for all, not just Mr. Bloomberg.
1089	Chuck Todd	The question was about socialism.
1090	Michael Bloomberg	What a wonderful country we have, the best known socialist in the country happens to be a millionaire with three houses.
1091	Michael Bloomberg	What’d I miss here?
1092	Bernie Sanders	Well, you missed that I work in Washington, house one.
1093	Michael Bloomberg	That’s the first problem.
1094	Bernie Sanders	Live in Burlington, house two.
1095	Michael Bloomberg	That’s good.
1096	Bernie Sanders	And like thousands of other Vermonters, I do have a summer camp.
1097	Bernie Sanders	Forgive me for that.
1098	Bernie Sanders	Where is your home?
1099	Bernie Sanders	Which tax?
1100	Bernie Sanders	[inaudible 00:17:00] cap, forgive me for that.
1101	Bernie Sanders	Where is your home?
1102	Bernie Sanders	Which tax haven do you have your home?
1103	Michael Bloomberg	New York, New York city.
1104	Michael Bloomberg	Thank you very much.
1105	Michael Bloomberg	And I pay all my taxes and I’m happy to do it because I get something for it.
1106	Michael Bloomberg	And let me say, I thought that the senator next to me was half-right.
1107	Elizabeth Warren	[inaudible 00:17:17].
1108	Michael Bloomberg	I agree.
1109	Michael Bloomberg	We should raise taxes on the … I disagree with the senator on the wealth tax, but I do agree with her that the rich aren’t paying their fair share.
1110	Michael Bloomberg	We should raise taxes on the rich.
1111	Michael Bloomberg	I did that as mayor in New York City.
1112	Michael Bloomberg	I raised taxes and if you take a look at my plans, the first thing I would do is try to convince Congress, because they’ve got to do it, we can’t just order it, to roll back the tax cuts that the Trump administration put in through Congress.
1113	Elizabeth Warren	Joe, can we talk-
1114	Lester Holt	Vice President Biden, weigh in on this question of Americans’ feeling about socialist candidates.
1115	Joe Biden	Well look, let me weigh in on, you know, for 36 years and as Vice President, I was listed as the poorest man in Congress.
1116	Joe Biden	I made money when I wrote a book about my son and it surprised me how much it sold.
1117	Joe Biden	First time I ever made any money, and here’s the deal.
1118	Joe Biden	The fact is that we ought to start rewarding work, not just wealth.
1119	Joe Biden	The idea that we have a tax rate for corporate America at 21% is ridiculous.
1120	Joe Biden	It should be at 28%.
1121	Joe Biden	that would raise almost $800 billion a year.
1122	Joe Biden	The idea that we have companies not paying anything at all, they should have a minimum tax of 15%, that would raise another 740 billion a year.
1123	Joe Biden	The idea that you’re able to have a capital gains tax that you pay at the rate of 20% if you are Mike Bloomberg or whomever, and has a whole lot of money and someone else is paying, your staffer is paying at 25%, is wrong.
1124	Joe Biden	That would raise another $800 billion.
1125	Joe Biden	We should be rewarding work, not just wealth.
1126	Joe Biden	And the American people and the middle class is getting killed and the poor have no way up.
1127	Elizabeth Warren	Can we go back to one thing?
1128	Lester Holt	All right, all right.
1129	Lester Holt	Vice President Biden, thank you.
1130	Lester Holt	Chuck?
1131	Chuck Todd	Mayor Buttigieg, I want to get you in on this because in 2000, you wrote an award-winning essay.
1132	Chuck Todd	You praised Senator Sanders.
1133	Chuck Todd	You specifically praised him for embracing socialism.
1134	Chuck Todd	You have now since said that you are concerned about his policies, but I am curious about this.
1135	Chuck Todd	Are you out of touch with your own generation?
1136	Chuck Todd	Millennials, by a big chunk, embrace his version of democratic socialism.
1137	Chuck Todd	You do not.
1138	Chuck Todd	Are you out of touch with your generation?
1139	Pete Buttigieg	No.
1140	Pete Buttigieg	Look, it’s true that I was into Bernie before it was cool.
1141	Bernie Sanders	Thank you.
1142	Pete Buttigieg	He was a congressman at the time, and the qualities I admired then are qualities I still respect a great deal.
1143	Pete Buttigieg	I never said that I agree with every part of his policy views then or now, but I appreciate that at least he’s straightforward and honest about it, and he’s honest about the fact that taxes will go up on anybody making more than $29,000.00 to fund his health care plan.
1144	Pete Buttigieg	Although again, a little bit vague about how the rest of that gap-
1145	Bernie Sanders	But you’re not being honest, the premiums would be eliminated.
1146	Pete Buttigieg	But you’re still raising those taxes and when you do it-
1147	Bernie Sanders	I’m saving people money because they don’t pay any premiums, out-of-pocket expenses, co-payments or deductibles.
1148	Bernie Sanders	They’re going to be much better off.
1149	Pete Buttigieg	But where’s the other $25 trillion supposed to come from?
1150	Pete Buttigieg	At a certain point, you got to do the math.
1151	Bernie Sanders	Well, we’ve got it all up there on the internet.
1152	Bernie Sanders	It’s a payroll tax.
1153	Pete Buttigieg	No, but even after the payroll tax because you still have a hole.
1154	Elizabeth Warren	Understanding-
1155	Bernie Sanders	Because we have a wealth tax.
1156	Bernie Sanders	Elizabeth has a good one.
1157	Bernie Sanders	Our is a little bit tougher on Mr. Bloomberg than hurts.
1158	Bernie Sanders	We’re going to raise it in a progressive way, which deals with income and wealth inequality and make certain finally that healthcare in this country is a human right, not a privilege.
1159	Elizabeth Warren	Could I [crosstalk 00:20:49].
1160	Chuck Todd	45 seconds, Senator Warren, I’m just going to close it out here.
1161	Chuck Todd	You went out of your way to call yourself a capitalist.
1162	Elizabeth Warren	Yes, because I am.
1163	Chuck Todd	To separate yourself from him.
1164	Chuck Todd	Why?
1165	Elizabeth Warren	Yes, because I am.
1166	Elizabeth Warren	Look, Democrats want to beat Donald Trump, but they are worried.
1167	Elizabeth Warren	They are worried about gambling on a narrow vision that doesn’t address the fears of millions of Americans across this country who see real problems and want real change.
1168	Elizabeth Warren	They are worried about gambling on a revolution that won’t bring along a majority of this country.
1169	Elizabeth Warren	Amy and Joe’s hearts are in the right place, but we can’t be so eager to be liked by Mitch McConnell that we forget how to fight the Republicans.
1170	Amy Klobuchar	Seriously?
1171	Amy Klobuchar	Elizabeth-
1172	Elizabeth Warren	Mayor Buttigieg has been taking money from big donors and changing his positions.
1173	Pete Buttigieg	That’s just not true.
1174	Elizabeth Warren	So it makes it unclear what it is he stands for other than his own advancement.
1175	Chuck Todd	Okay, Senator, thank you.
1176	Chuck Todd	Senator Klobuchar, go ahead you’ve got this.
1177	Pete Buttigieg	I’ll be very clear-
1178	Chuck Todd	Senator Klobuchar, go ahead.
1179	Chuck Todd	You’ve got the floor for 45, go.
1180	Amy Klobuchar	Thank you.
1181	Amy Klobuchar	Number one.
1182	Amy Klobuchar	I have repeatedly said that we have to win big and the way we win big is winning states like Nevada, but also winning the Senate races in Arizona and in Colorado and beyond.
1183	Amy Klobuchar	And the reason we want to do that is to send Mitch McConnell packing.
1184	Amy Klobuchar	And I think when you look at my history, I am the one that has done that.
1185	Amy Klobuchar	I am the one that can lead this ticket and just because I am willing to talk about common ground, that’s where America is.
1186	Amy Klobuchar	It is not with Mitch McConnell who has 400 bills on his desk that should pass if we get rid of him.
1187	Elizabeth Warren	May I respond?
1188	Amy Klobuchar	It is because I am willing to work with people and find common ground.
1189	Chuck Todd	Thank you Senator.
1190	Lester Holt	Let’s everybody-
1191	Amy Klobuchar	That’s what we want in a president, Elisabeth.
1192	Lester Holt	Let’s catch our breath here.
1193	Amy Klobuchar	We don’t want someone that looks at just plans and different-
1194	Lester Holt	Senator, thank you.
1195	Lester Holt	We need to take another break here.
1196	Lester Holt	We’ll return to The Paris Las Vegas in just a moment (silence).
1197	Lester Holt	Welcome back to Las Vegas and the Democratic Presidential Debate.
1198	Lester Holt	To kick off our next round of questioning, here’s Hallie.
1199	Helen	Mayor Buttigieg, to you.
1200	Helen	In 2018, Mayor Bloomberg was the biggest outside spender helping Democrats running for Congress.
1201	Helen	He’s also donated billions towards causes like climate change, gun safety, education.
1202	Helen	If his money wasn’t a problem then, why is it a problem now?
1203	Pete Buttigieg	Oh, I think he should absolutely be doing everything in his power to defeat Donald Trump.
1204	Pete Buttigieg	I just don’t think that has to result in him becoming the President of the United States.
1205	Pete Buttigieg	Look, our party has values.
1206	Pete Buttigieg	We were built around values like making sure we protect working people, but Mayor Bloomberg opposed raising the minimum wage.
1207	Pete Buttigieg	Our party has a tradition that includes excellent presidents like Barack Obama, who Mayor Bloomberg opposed.
1208	Pete Buttigieg	At the end of the day, it’s not just about how much money you’ve got, it’s what you stand for.
1209	Pete Buttigieg	And we are living at a moment when Americans are so deeply frustrated with the way that both Wall Street and Washington seem to have overlooked our lives.
1210	Pete Buttigieg	The view from the porch of my one house in Indiana is that they can’t even see us sometimes.
1211	Pete Buttigieg	And if we’re going into the election of our lives against a president who rose to power by cynically exploited the frustration of ordinary Americans feeling like leaders weren’t speaking to them; then I think that turning to someone like Mayor Bloomberg who thinks he can buy this election is no better a way to succeed than turning to somebody like Senator Sanders who wants to burn the house down.
1212	Helen	Mr. Vice President.
1213	Joe Biden	You know, if you [inaudible 00:28:47] the point of personal privilege used to say.
1214	Joe Biden	It was said that I was in the pocket of Mitch McConnell.
1215	Joe Biden	I’m the only person on this stage that’s beaten Mitch McConnell on four major, major cases.
1216	Joe Biden	Let me finish.
1217	Joe Biden	Let me finish.
1218	Joe Biden	And Mitch McConnell.
1219	Joe Biden	I’ve been the object of his affection and the President’s affection.
1220	Joe Biden	The way he’s gone after me, this new Republican party, after me, after my son, after my family.
1221	Joe Biden	I don’t need to be told I’m a friend of Mitch McConnell’s.
1222	Joe Biden	Mitch McConnell has been the biggest pain in my neck in a long, long time and so that’s number one.
1223	Joe Biden	Number two, we have to have somebody who understands what it’s like for ordinary people.
1224	Joe Biden	Ordinary people come up.
1225	Joe Biden	They have to understand, like my dad made that longest walk up a short flight of stairs, saying, “I don’t have a job honey.
1226	Joe Biden	We have to move.
1227	Joe Biden	You got to move in with grandpa.” How long it took to buy a house, how long it took to get back in the game again.
1228	Joe Biden	They have to understand the needs of ordinary people and they are getting killed.
1229	Joe Biden	No matter what people say about this economy, how good it is and the good part of the economy … It’s only 60 seconds, it’s not up yet, and the fact is that we’re in a situation where you have Mayor, excuse me, the President making clear that he doesn’t want any part of me being his opponent.
1230	Joe Biden	He’s spending $125,000.00 this week to keep me from being an opponent.
1231	Joe Biden	I wonder why?
1232	Helen	Thank you Mr. Vice President.
1233	Helen	Vanessa, to you.
1234	Elizabeth Warren	Can I respond to the Vice President, please?
1235	Vanessa Hauc	Thank you Hallie.
1236	Elizabeth Warren	He was identifying me specifically in that.
1237	Vanessa Hauc	45 seconds to you Senator Warren.
1238	Joe Biden	I was responding to an accusation.
1239	Elizabeth Warren	And so no, the point is different.
1240	Elizabeth Warren	Here’s what happened.
1241	Elizabeth Warren	According to the New York Times, the last time that Mitch McConnell was on the ballot, the Vice President stood in the Oval Office and said, “I hope that Mitch gets re-elected so I can keep working with him.”
1242	Joe Biden	That’s taken totally out of context.
1243	Elizabeth Warren	Well, Mitch did get did cap re-elected.
1244	Elizabeth Warren	He did not have an epiphany.
1245	Elizabeth Warren	Instead, he blocked really everything that Barack Obama tried to pass.
1246	Joe Biden	Did you ever win anything?
1247	Elizabeth Warren	He stole a Supreme court seat-
1248	Joe Biden	Come on.
1249	Elizabeth Warren	… From the Democrats, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau?
1250	Vanessa Hauc	Thank you Senator.
1251	Joe Biden	Yeah [inaudible 00:00:30:55].
1252	Vanessa Hauc	Thank you Senator.
1253	Vanessa Hauc	Our next question goes to Senator Klobuchar.
1254	Vanessa Hauc	About 700,000 young people known as Dreamers or Soñadores, who were brought to this country as children, are currently protected from deportation because of a program that is now under the review by the Supreme Court.
1255	Vanessa Hauc	If the Court sides with the Trump administration, which is eager to end this protection, what exactly is your plan to protect the Dreamers permanently?
1256	Amy Klobuchar	To win.
1257	Amy Klobuchar	To beat Donald Trump.
1258	Amy Klobuchar	The best way to protect the Dreamers is to have a new President.
1259	Amy Klobuchar	There are the votes there to protect the Dreamers, and I have been working on this since I got to the United States Senate.
1260	Amy Klobuchar	In my first campaign, I actually had a bunch of ads run against me because I was standing up for immigrants.
1261	Amy Klobuchar	And when I think of Dreamers and I tried to explain it to my state, I found a 99-year-old Hispanic war veteran who was a Dreamer when he was brought over to this country.
1262	Amy Klobuchar	And back then, he just went to Canada for a night and came back and he was a permanent citizen because they needed him to serve in World War II.
1263	Amy Klobuchar	Now, not so easy.
1264	Amy Klobuchar	The Dreamers are our future.
1265	Amy Klobuchar	The Dreamers are so important in Nevada and the best way we can get this done is to beat Donald Trump, but it is to pass comprehensive immigration reform.
1266	Vanessa Hauc	Thank you.
1267	Amy Klobuchar	Which creates a path to citizenship to so many hardworking people, who will bring down the deficit by $158 billion and will bring peace for these Dreamers.
1268	Vanessa Hauc	Thank you so much Senator Klobuchar.
1269	Amy Klobuchar	They know no other country but our own.
1270	Pete Buttigieg	If you’re going to run based on your record of voting in Washington, then you have to own those votes, especially when it comes to immigration.
1271	Pete Buttigieg	You voted to confirm the Head of Customs and Border Protection under Trump, who was one of the architects of the family separation policy.
1272	Pete Buttigieg	You voted to make English the national language.
1273	Pete Buttigieg	Do you know the message that sends in as multilingual a state as Nevada, to immigrants?
1274	Pete Buttigieg	You have been unusual among Democrats, I think the Democrat among all of the senators running for President, most likely to vote for Donald Trump’s judges who we know are especially hostile to Dreamers and to the rights of immigrants.
1275	Pete Buttigieg	Now in South Bend, it was not always easy to stand up in a conservative place like Indiana on immigration, but we delivered.
1276	Pete Buttigieg	We created a municipal ID program so that Dreamers and others who were undocumented were able to navigate everyday life.
1277	Pete Buttigieg	We stood up for those rights and stood with members of our community with the message that they were as American as we are [Spanish 00:33:31].
1278	Vanessa Hauc	Thank you.
1279	Vanessa Hauc	[crosstalk 00:33:36] Senator Klobuchar.
1280	Amy Klobuchar	I wish everyone was as perfect as you, Pete, but let me tell you what it’s like to be in the arena.
1281	Amy Klobuchar	Number one, do the math.
1282	Amy Klobuchar	If my friend Andrew Yang was up here, that’s what he’d say.
1283	Amy Klobuchar	In fact, I have opposed, not supported two-thirds of the Trump judges, so get your numbers right.
1284	Amy Klobuchar	And I am in the top 10 to 15 of opposing them.
1285	Amy Klobuchar	Number two, when it comes to immigration reform.
1286	Amy Klobuchar	… number two, when it comes to immigration reform the things that you are referring to, that official that you are referring to, was supported by about half the Democrats.
1287	Amy Klobuchar	Including someone in this room.
1288	Amy Klobuchar	I will say this, he was highly recommended by the Obama officials.
1289	Amy Klobuchar	You know why?
1290	Amy Klobuchar	Because Trump had so few career people.
1291	Amy Klobuchar	I did not one bit agree with these draconian policies to separate kids from their parents.
1292	Amy Klobuchar	In my first 100 days I would immediately change that.
1293	Amy Klobuchar	I would add one more thing, I have been in the arena-
1294	Moderator 1	Thank you Senator.
1295	Amy Klobuchar	… Ted Kennedy … He had made a pretty big allegation against me again.
1296	Amy Klobuchar	I think I should have a right to respond.
1297	Amy Klobuchar	He had-
1298	Pete Buttigieg	I’m stating the facts because these are votes that you took.
1299	Amy Klobuchar	… Ted Kennedy-
1300	Pete Buttigieg	And those votes set you alone among the Democrats running for president.
1301	Amy Klobuchar	Just-
1302	Pete Buttigieg	No other … Is it true or is it false that no other Democrat-
1303	Amy Klobuchar	First of all-
1304	Pete Buttigieg	… from the Senate running for-
1305	Amy Klobuchar	… it is what you’ve said about-
1306	Pete Buttigieg	… president voted that way?
1307	Amy Klobuchar	… the judges are false.
1308	Amy Klobuchar	You are comparing me to two colleagues up here on this stage and you are forgetting one thing-
1309	Pete Buttigieg	Well I would say for anybody who ran for president this cycle.
1310	Pete Buttigieg	Senator Harris-
1311	Amy Klobuchar	You know what Pete?
1312	Pete Buttigieg	… Senator Booker saw to this-
1313	Amy Klobuchar	If you could let me finish.
1314	Amy Klobuchar	Since I’ve been in the arena Ted Kennedy asked me to work on the first immigration bill.
1315	Amy Klobuchar	We were able, with President Bush, to at least get that bill to a vote.
1316	Amy Klobuchar	I’m sorry, but Senator Sanders actually opposed that bill.
1317	Amy Klobuchar	I worked on it.
1318	Amy Klobuchar	If we had gotten that bill done there would have been a path to citizenship for so many people.
1319	Amy Klobuchar	Then I worked on the 2013 bill.
1320	Amy Klobuchar	I’m actually so proud of [crosstalk 00:35:25] the work I’ve done on immigration reform.
1321	Amy Klobuchar	You know what?
1322	Amy Klobuchar	You have not been in the arena doing that work.
1323	Amy Klobuchar	You’ve memorized a bunch of talking points and a bunch of things, but I can tell you one thing, what the people of this country want.
1324	Amy Klobuchar	They want a leader that has the heart for the immigrants of this country.
1325	Amy Klobuchar	That is me.
1326	Pete Buttigieg	Maybe leading a diverse city that was facing ruin doesn’t sound like the arena to you.
1327	Pete Buttigieg	I’m used to senators telling mayors that senators are more important than mayors, but this is the arena too.
1328	Pete Buttigieg	You don’t have to be in Washington to matter.
1329	Pete Buttigieg	You don’t have to be on Capital Hill-
1330	Chuck Todd	Okay.
1331	Pete Buttigieg	… for [crosstalk 00:36:02] your work to be significant.
1332	Chuck Todd	Guys, guys.
1333	Pete Buttigieg	The arena is everywhere-
1334	Chuck Todd	We are at the end here.
1335	Chuck Todd	We are at the end here.
1336	Chuck Todd	I got to let that one go.
1337	Chuck Todd	We are less than two weeks away from a national primary.
1338	Chuck Todd	I want to ask all of you this simple question.
1339	Chuck Todd	There’s a very good chance none of you are going to have enough delegates to the Democratic National Convention to clinch this nomination.
1340	Chuck Todd	Okay?
1341	Chuck Todd	If that happens, I want all of your opinions on this, should the person with the most delegates at the end of this primary season be the nominee?
1342	Chuck Todd	Even if they are short of a majority?
1343	Chuck Todd	Senator Sanders I’m going to let you go last here, because I know your view on this.
1344	Chuck Todd	Instead I will start with you Mayor Bloomberg.
1345	Michael Bloomberg	Whatever the rules of the for the Democratic Party are they should be followed.
1346	Michael Bloomberg	If they have a process, which I believe they do-
1347	Chuck Todd	Okay, I’m trying to do this-
1348	Michael Bloomberg	… so that everybody else-
1349	Chuck Todd	Yes or no, you got to make it fast.
1350	Michael Bloomberg	Everybody can-
1351	Chuck Todd	So you want the convention to work its will?
1352	Michael Bloomberg	Yes.
1353	Chuck Todd	Senator Warren?
1354	Elizabeth Warren	But a convention working its will means that people have the delegates that are pledged to them and they keep those delegates until-
1355	Chuck Todd	Should the leading person-
1356	Elizabeth Warren	… you come to the convention.
1357	Chuck Todd	Okay.
1358	Elizabeth Warren	All of the people.
1359	Chuck Todd	All righty.
1360	Chuck Todd	Vice President Biden?
1361	Joe Biden	Play by the rules.
1362	Chuck Todd	Yes or no, leading person with the delegates, should they be the nominee or not?
1363	Joe Biden	No, let the process work its way out.
1364	Chuck Todd	Mayor Buttigieg?
1365	Pete Buttigieg	Not necessarily.
1366	Pete Buttigieg	Not till there’s-
1367	Chuck Todd	[crosstalk 00:37:12] Senator Klobuchar?
1368	Amy Klobuchar	Let the process work.
1369	Chuck Todd	Senator Sanders?
1370	Bernie Sanders	Well the process includes 500 super delegates on the second ballot, so I think that-
1371	Chuck Todd	All right.
1372	Bernie Sanders	… that the will of the people should prevail.
1373	Chuck Todd	Okay.
1374	Bernie Sanders	Yes.
1375	Chuck Todd	[crosstalk 00:37:24] Thank you guys.
1376	Bernie Sanders	… who has the most votes should become the nominee.
1377	Chuck Todd	Five nos and a yes.
1378	Lester Holt	We are not done yet.
1379	Lester Holt	We’re back with more from Las Vegas after a short break.
1380	Lester Holt	(silence)
1381	Lester Holt	Welcome back everyone.
1382	Lester Holt	It is time for closing statements.
1383	Lester Holt	Each candidate will have one minute and we begin with Senator Klobuchar.
1384	Amy Klobuchar	This has been quite a debate.
1385	Amy Klobuchar	What I want everyone out there watching to remember is that what unites us is so much bigger than what divides us.
1386	Amy Klobuchar	That we need a candidate that can bring people with her.
1387	Amy Klobuchar	Yes a fired up Democratic base but also Independents and moderate Republicans.
1388	Amy Klobuchar	I’ve done that every single time.
1389	Amy Klobuchar	I have won every race down to fourth grade.
1390	Amy Klobuchar	A lot of boasting up here, so I thought I’d add that.
1391	Amy Klobuchar	Secondly, you need someone who can govern.
1392	Amy Klobuchar	I have passed over 100 bills as the lead Democrat.
1393	Amy Klobuchar	Third, you need someone that has the heart to be the president.
1394	Amy Klobuchar	They were talking a lot about heart conditions up here.
1395	Amy Klobuchar	We have a president right now that doesn’t have a heart.
1396	Amy Klobuchar	I love the people of this country.
1397	Amy Klobuchar	I ask for the vote of the people of Nevada because this state gets it.
1398	Amy Klobuchar	They get that maybe you don’t agree with every single thing that’s said on this debate stage but we understand that the heart of America is bigger than any heart-
1399	Lester Holt	Senator Klobuchar-
1400	Amy Klobuchar	… that guy has in The White House.
1401	Lester Holt	Senator Klobuchar-
1402	Amy Klobuchar	I ask you to join me at amyklobuchar.com.
1403	Lester Holt	Senator, thank you.
1404	Amy Klobuchar	Thank you.
1405	Moderator 1	Mayor Bloomberg, to you.
1406	Michael Bloomberg	Well you can join me at mikebloomberg.com too if you want but I’m not asking for any money.
1407	Michael Bloomberg	Look, this is a management job and Donald Trump’s not a manager.
1408	Michael Bloomberg	This is a job where you have to build teams, he doesn’t have a team so he goes and makes decisions without knowing what’s going on or the implications of what he does.
1409	Michael Bloomberg	We can not run the railroad this way.
1410	Michael Bloomberg	This country has to pull together and understand that the people that we elect, and it’s not just the president of the United States, they should have experience, they should have credentials, they should understand what they’re doing and the implications thereof.
1411	Michael Bloomberg	Then we should, as a society, try to hold them accountable so the next time they go before the voters, if they haven’t done the job we shouldn’t just say, “Oh nice person, gives a good speech.” We should say, “Didn’t do the job and you’re out of here.”
1412	Moderator 1	Mr. Mayor, thank you.
1413	Lester Holt	Mayor Buttigieg, one minute.
1414	Pete Buttigieg	Well Nevada I’m asking for your vote because America is running out of time.
1415	Pete Buttigieg	This is our only chance to defeat Donald Trump.
1416	Pete Buttigieg	If you look at the choice between a revolution or the status quo and you don’t see where you fit in that picture then join us.
1417	Pete Buttigieg	Yes, go for peteforamerica.com and help out, because we need to draw everybody that we can who believes that we need to empower workers, who believes in climate science, who believes in doing something about gun violence and recognizes that the only way we can do this is to create a sense of belonging in this country that moves us out of the toxic and polarized moment that we are living in today.
1418	Pete Buttigieg	I already see an American majority ready to do these things.
1419	Pete Buttigieg	Now we have a responsibility to galvanize, not polarize, that majority.
1420	Pete Buttigieg	We can not afford to lean on the same Washington playbook.
1421	Pete Buttigieg	We can not afford to alienate half the country.
1422	Pete Buttigieg	We must step forward into the future in order to win and in order to govern a country that will be facing issues the likes of which we barely thought of just a few years ago.
1423	Lester Holt	Mr. Mayor-
1424	Pete Buttigieg	I’m asking you to join me-
1425	Lester Holt	… thank you.
1426	Pete Buttigieg	… so that we can deliver that future together.
1427	Moderator 4	Senator Warren, your turn.
1428	Elizabeth Warren	I grew up fighting.
1429	Elizabeth Warren	I grew up out in Oklahoma and I learned it probably from my mother.
1430	Elizabeth Warren	I watched when my daddy had a heart attack and didn’t have any money coming in.
1431	Elizabeth Warren	When our car was lost and when we were on the edge of losing our home.
1432	Elizabeth Warren	I watched my mother fight to save our family.
1433	Elizabeth Warren	I grew up fighting to save our family, my family.
1434	Elizabeth Warren	I eventually made it through school and spent my life as a teacher.
1435	Elizabeth Warren	Looking into why it is that so many families across this country are struggling and why it gets worse year, after year, after year.
1436	Elizabeth Warren	I, for years, have fought for unions.
1437	Elizabeth Warren	To say the way we’re going to restructure this economy is we’re going to make it easier to join a union and get more power into unions.
1438	Elizabeth Warren	To fight for students who have been cut out of opportunity over and over because of the rising cost of an education.
1439	Elizabeth Warren	Look, for me, I am … Of all the people on this stage I’ve been a politician the shortest time but I’ve been the one out fighting for families the longest time.
1440	Elizabeth Warren	I promise you this, give me a chance, I’ll go to The White House and I’ll fight for your family.
1441	Moderator 4	Thank you Senator.
1442	Chuck Todd	Vice President Biden?
1443	Joe Biden	I’m running because so many people-
1444	Audience	[crosstalk 00:46:34] people.
1445	Audience	There’s not [crosstalk 00:46:37].
1446	Bernie Sanders	Just continue [inaudible 00:46:39].
1447	Audience	[crosstalk 00:46:41].
1448	Audience	We don’t want-
1449	Lester Holt	[crosstalk 00:46:47] Please give us a moment.
1450	Lester Holt	We’ll clear the room and let the-
1451	Audience	[crosstalk 00:46:58].
1452	Lester Holt	And let-
1453	Audience	[crosstalk 00:46:58].
1454	Lester Holt	Senator Biden you have one minute.
1455	Joe Biden	Look, I’m running because so many people are being left behind.
1456	Joe Biden	People I grew up with in Scranton when my job lost his job, lost his house, had to move.
1457	Joe Biden	We moved to Claymont and we found ourselves in a position where we had little ability to get anything done.
1458	Joe Biden	My dad worked like hell.
1459	Joe Biden	I learned a lot.
1460	Joe Biden	I’ve been knocked down a whole hell of a lot.
1461	Joe Biden	I know what it’s like to be knocked down, but I know we have to get back up.
1462	Joe Biden	We have to provide some safety and security for the American people.
1463	Joe Biden	Right here in Nevada the site of the most significant mass murder in American history.
1464	Joe Biden	Guns.
1465	Joe Biden	Our kids are getting sent to school having to hide under desks, learn how to run down corridors to avoid being shot.
1466	Joe Biden	It’s immoral.
1467	Joe Biden	I’m the only one that’s beating the NRA nationally and I’ve beat them twice.
1468	Joe Biden	With regard to healthcare, it also is something that isn’t right.
1469	Joe Biden	Obamacare has to be expanded.
1470	Joe Biden	It can be, in fact, cover everybody.
1471	Joe Biden	Lastly, I think it’s important that on day one we deal with sending an immigration bill to the desk.
1472	Joe Biden	The only person in here has the worst record on immigration is Bernie because Bernie voted against the 2007 bill.
1473	Lester Holt	All right-
1474	Moderator 1	Thank you-
1475	Joe Biden	Had, in fact, that-
1476	Moderator 1	… thank you.
1477	Moderator 1	Thank you.
1478	Joe Biden	… immigration bill passed-
1479	Moderator 1	Thank you Mr. Vice President-
1480	Joe Biden	… there would be 10 … Six million members would be-
1481	Lester Holt	Okay.
1482	Joe Biden	… now American citizens.
1483	Lester Holt	All right.
1484	Lester Holt	Senator Sanders you have one minute for your closing argument.
1485	Bernie Sanders	Unfortunately Rulac, among other groups, Latino groups, saw that bill having provisions akin to slavery Joe.
1486	Bernie Sanders	But the bottom line is all of us are united in defeating the most dangerous president in the modern history of this country.
1487	Bernie Sanders	That we agree on.
1488	Bernie Sanders	But where we don’t agree, I think, is why we are today the only major country on Earth not to guarantee healthcare to all people.
1489	Bernie Sanders	Why three people own more wealth than the bottom half of America, when 500,000 people sleep out on the street.
1490	Bernie Sanders	Why hundreds of thousands of bright young kids can’t afford to go to college and 45 million remain in student debt.
1491	Bernie Sanders	Bottom line here, real change never takes place from the top on down, never takes place from an oligarchy controlled by billionaires.
1492	Bernie Sanders	We need to mobilize millions of people to stand up for justice.
1493	Bernie Sanders	That’s our campaign.
1494	Bernie Sanders	Join us at berniesanders.com.
1495	Bernie Sanders	Thank you.
1496	Lester Holt	Senator thank you.
1497	Lester Holt	Folks, thank you.
1498	Lester Holt	That concludes tonight’s debate.
1499	Lester Holt	Our thanks to my fellow moderators, to the candidates, and of course to all of you, the audience, here and at home.
1500	Lester Holt	The Nevada Caucuses are this Saturday.
1501	Lester Holt	With the South Carolina primary just one week later.
1502	Lester Holt	Then the big prize, Super Tuesday on March 3rd.
1503	Lester Holt	We’ll be following it all for you.
1504	Lester Holt	For now, for all of us at NBC News, I’m Lester Holt.
1505	Lester Holt	Good day.
