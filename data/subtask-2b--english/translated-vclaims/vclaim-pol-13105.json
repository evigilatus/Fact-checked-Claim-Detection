Scott Walker invented the $3.6 billion state deficit.", "text": "The Wisconsin Democratic Party billed the Founder's Day party as an event to focus on resistance to Scott Walker's control of divisive power. One of the speakers dressed as Governor of the Republic in Wisconsin on the occasion of April 30, 2011 was the United States Republic of America, Gwen Moore, D-Wisconsin. Moore began her remarks by referring to the keynote speaker, Massachusetts Goff. Deval Patrick, and his new memoirs, reason to believe. \"I was thinking: How in the world can you believe, why do you believe in anything, when you have just elected a governor who says that Wisconsin was open to action and thus closed to every single human being in the state,\" said Moore to applause. Moore said that Walker was cutting funding for schools, Medicaid, birth control and public transport, but saving \"200 million dollars from tax exemptions - and (he) literally invented a $3.6 billion budget deficit. Wait a minute. \"Invented literally\"? We've gone this way several times before. Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" On 26 January 2021, in November 2010, when his time as governor was shrinking, democracy Jim Doyle said that the deficit was down to $1.5 billion. We estimated that statement to be wrong, given that Doyle's top manager was almost immediately portraying the figure as $2.2 billion and that outside experts put it on about $3 billion. In February 2011, six weeks after Walker took office, Mark Buchanan (D-Madison) received a false claim for his claim of deficiency. Buchanan said that Walker created a financial crisis and that his $3.6 billion estimate was a bogus figure. At that time, we found that Doyle had left a deficit of over $3 billion and that Walker had followed Madison's previous practice in making his assessment. We asked Moore what evidence she had that Walker invented a $3.6 billion deficit. We will take up the point point of the response we received from Moore's spokesman, David Frey: Point 1: Moore believes that \"to make the state's finances worse\" and the financial office \"to remove the costs of tax cuts.\" Frey noted that UNOPS had said that the 2011-2013 Walker budget included $83 million in tax cuts. However, this figure does not address the size of the budget deficit, which existed before Walker proposed his budget in March 2011. It ignores the fact that the budget also includes $49 million in tax increases. Fry also noted that $117 million was lower than the amount that the State would bear due to other tax changes in Walker, but that figure also did not go to the size of the deficit, either. Point 2: Moore believes that when compared to other mandates, Wisconsin's budget is \"more manageable.\" This view to a large extent does not determine the size of the deficit in Wisconsin. Point 3: Moore thinks Walker \"is to make all the wrong choices in this matter.\" Another opinion does not reach the disability question. Point 4: Walker changes in State laws to limit the collective bargaining power of public officials \"were more than ideological than budgetary issues.\" Again, this is an opinion - a view widely shared by critics of Walker. But this, like others, is not about the size of the budget deficit. (As at 11 May 2011, a new projection showed that the situation would increase by some $200 million per year over the past three years. It is not clear how Walker and the legislature will amend the budget proposal. However, this also does not apply to Moore &apos; s claim, which was made prior to the issuance of the new projection.) In short, Moore does not provide any evidence to support her claim -- which means we find ourselves in a familiar direction. Moore said Walker invented $3.6 billion in state budget deficits. We have already established that this figure is a reasonable estimate. Moore does not provide any new evidence to the contrary. We assess her claim is wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13105"}
