Claim In Biden Ad Is True.", "text": "Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden attacked President Trump in a new digital campaign ad, which claims California firefighters \"spoke out\" against the president over his controversial tweet during the state\u2019s deadly November 2018 wildfires.\u00a0\nTrump\u2019s tweet, which was his first public comment on the fires, blamed the state\u2019s poor \"forest management\" for the infernos and threatened to withhold federal funding.\u00a0\nBiden\u2019s ad includes images of California burning and the head of the state\u2019s largest firefighters\u00a0union calling Trump\u2019s statement \"idiotic.\"\u00a0\u00a0\n\"Firefighters say the tweet contained so much misinformation, they had to speak out,\" the ad claims.\u00a0\nIs Biden\u2019s ad right? Did California firefighters, beyond the union president, really criticize Trump during the wildfires? We set out on a fact check.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe Camp Fire rages through Paradise, Calif., on Thursday, Nov. 8, 2018. Noah Berger / AP Photo\nBackground on the fires\nThe ad references Northern California\u2019s Camp Fire and Southern California\u2019s Woolsey Fire, both of which broke out in November 2018.\u00a0\nThe Camp Fire killed 86 people in Butte County and destroyed nearly 19,000 structures, including 14,000 homes, making it the state\u2019s most deadly and destructive wildfire in history. The Woolsey Fire killed three people and destroyed more than 1,600 structures.\u00a0\nHere\u2019s Trump\u2019s tweet from Nov. 10, 2018:\u00a0\nShortly after, PolitiFact California fact-checked Trump\u2019s claim that forest management is the sole reason for the fires. We rated it False.\u00a0\nForestry and climate experts told us stronger winds, higher temperatures and drier conditions driven by climate change are also making California\u2019s fires worse. They said forest management is one factor, but not necessarily the driving force.\u00a0\nIn another\u00a0tweet\u00a0two days later, Trump thanked California\u2019s firefighters and first responders. He also\u00a0approved\u00a0California's request for a major disaster declaration, freeing up federal aid for fire response and recovery.\nCriticism from firefighters\nThe most vocal fire leader to criticize Trump was Brian Rice, president of the California Professional Firefighters.\nRice is shown in the Biden ad saying \"That statement was idiodic,\" referring to Trump\u2019s tweet. The comments were lifted from an interview Rice did with a San Francisco TV news station. In the full interview, he added: \"It was ill timed. And it\u2019s ignorant. It\u2019s a statement of an ignorant man. \u2026 I love my country. I am proud to be an American. But I am disgusted with my president.\"\u00a0\nIn an interview this week, Rice called Biden's ad \"fair and accurate.\" A union spokesperson said Rice \"clearly spoke out,\" citing a formal statement he issued at the time. \"The statement pretty clearly indicates that Mr. Rice believes Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet was misinformed,\" he said.\nRice said his\u00a0chapter fully supports the decision of its national union to endorse Biden\u2019s 2020 presidential bid. The International Association of Fire Fighters announced its support for Biden in April.\u00a0\nBiden is in a virtual tie with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren among likely voters in California\u2019s Democratic primary, according to a Real Clear Politics average of polls.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nA spokesperson for Biden\u2019s campaign attributed all of the ad\u2019s statements, including the claim that firefighters spoke out against the president, to news coverage. The claim in question, that \"Firefighters say the tweet contained so much misinformation, they had to speak out,\" comes directly from a TV reporter narrating a news story.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 28, 2021 in a blog\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook tried to \u201cshut down\u201d the campaign to recall California Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Chris Nichols \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe found Rice wasn\u2019t the only fire leader to criticize Trump\u2019s words.\u00a0\nThe Biden ad includes a brief clip of Los Angeles Fire Chief Daryl Osby, pulled from a separate TV interview. In it, he says the state is \"in extreme climate change right now.\" That by itself isn\u2019t a biting critique. But Osby goes on to say in his full interview: \"I personally find that statement unsatisfactory \u2026 It\u2019s very hurtful for all first responders that are putting their lives on the line to protect lives and property.\"\u00a0\nTom O\u2019Connor, president of the San Francisco Fire Local 798, also criticized Trump\u2019s tweet, telling a TV station after asked about the tweet that, \"Now is not the time for politics. It\u2019s a time for leadership. It\u2019s not the \u2018red and blue states of America.\u2019 It\u2019s the United States of America.\"\u00a0\nFinally, Scott Austin, president of the Pasadena Firefighters Association said in a tweet: \"Mr. President, with all due respect, you are wrong.\u00a0 The fires in So. Cal are urban interface fires and have NOTHING to do with forest management. Come to SoCal and learn the facts & help the victims. Scott Austin, Pres IAFF 809.\"\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nFormer vice president and current Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden attacked President Trump in a recent campaign ad over his comments last year on California\u2019s deadly wildfires.\nThe Biden ad claimed California firefighters \"spoke out\" against the president over a controversial tweet he made as the fires raged. The tweet included a threat to withhold federal funds.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe ad shows two fire leaders, including the president of the state\u2019s largest firefighter union, speaking out when asked about Trump\u2019s statements. Full interviews with those leaders show they went on to make even stronger critiques of Trump.\nAdditional news reports show other top fire leaders calling out the president\u2019s tweet as misinformed and an inappropriate use of politics during a time of crisis.\u00a0\nThis backs up the main assertion about firefighters speaking out.\nWe rated the claim in the Biden ad as True.\u00a0\n\nTRUE \u2013\u00a0The statement is accurate and there\u2019s nothing significant missing.\nClick here for\u00a0more\u00a0on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.\nAsk PolitiFact California!\nDo you have a question about California politics or government?\u00a0\nSend it to us here\u00a0and one of our reporters will consider it for our next \u2018Ask PolitiFact California\u2019 report.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16703"}
