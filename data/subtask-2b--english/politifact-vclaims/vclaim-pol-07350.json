He told PolitiFact that he was sent to Hong Kong for two years to increase manufacturing and contracts in Asia for the firm.\n\"I was sent to Asia to open those markets for Sara Lee, and we did,\" Perdue said. \"That was the direction of the company at the time.\"\nPerdue\u2019s effort to open the region for Sara Lee was a success, as was the firm for part of that time.\nSara Lee was founded in 1939 as a food processing and distribution company. Its iconic name came from the 1956 purchase of the Kitchens of Sara Lee, a Chicago bakery known for its cheesecake.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoy Barnes\n\n\nstated on May 21, 2010 in a campaign commercial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Roy Barnes was governor, \"Georgia created 235,000 jobs.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Willoughby Mariano \u2022 June 4, 2010\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the early 1990s, though, Sara Lee had expanded worldwide and into other industries with its purchase of Hanes Corporation and Coach leather goods, among others.\nFor the first three years of the decade, the company rapidly splurged even more, focusing on foreign firms and other well-known brands such as undergarment maker Playtex,\nInvestors began to question the company\u2019s broad vision, though. The result was the first of several major restructuring plans and layoffs in 1994, Perdue\u2019s last year with Sara Lee.\nThe 1994 overhaul eliminated 9,900 jobs worldwide, while \"realigning production and distribution facilities throughout the world,\" according to SEC filings.\nAmong the casualties were 540 jobs at apparel plants in Cartersville, Milledgeville and Wrightsville. A fourth Georgia plant, in Midway, was also shut down, though the number of jobs lost was not published.\nSara Lee\u2019s annual report from 1994 does not break down how many of its 144,900 employees were domestic or foreign. However, a statement from the company at the time said most of the eliminated jobs were at European operations.\nThe annual report does note the company\u2019s success in manufacturing and sales in Asia, especially in China, India, Malaysia, Thailand and Hong Kong, now part of China.\n\"David Perdue says he's the better candidate because he's spent his career in the 'real world,' but at too many stops along the way, he seemed to prosper while the people who worked for him saw their livelihoods taken away,\" said Nunn spokesman Nathan Click.\nBy all indications, the outsourcing effort at Sara Lee did have that effect. The company expanded what it made and sold in Asia, at a time when it was closing facilities elsewhere, including in Georgia.\nAs a senior vice president, Perdue had limited input on that direction.\nBut he did execute Sara Lee\u2019s effort, which the company lauded in its own annual report to federal regulators.\nNunn\u2019s claim is carefully worded to say Perdue\u2019s company, not the candidate himself, was shutting Georgia plants at a time it was adding jobs in Asia. News reports and company filings back up the claim.\nWe rate Nunn\u2019s claim True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07350"}
