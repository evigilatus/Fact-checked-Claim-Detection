He said Republicans missed an opportunity to substantially restructure spending in areas like collective bargaining and the state\u2019s public employee retirement system (PERS).\n\"Because the GOP controlled both branches of the Legislature and the governor\u2019s office for the first time in 89 years, for the first time in 89 years our state government could have made meaningful (substantive) cuts to government spending, and they should have before they raised taxes,\" he said in an email.\nTarkanian\u2019s comments do point to an interesting question -- what exactly did Nevada lawmakers do to reduce spending outside of the tax increase?\nThere\u2019s no easy way to compare spending cuts from one two-year budget to another. (Nevada\u2019s part-time Legislature necessitates two-year budgets.) Assembly Majority Leader Paul Anderson, who chaired one of the legislative finance committees, requested that legislative staffers document spending cuts in response to questions from PolitiFact.\nAnderson said lawmakers cut an additional $150 million from \"ineffective programs\" in the two-year budget to free up funds for increased needs in areas like state spending for Medicaid. He said lawmakers tried to leverage most of the new spending towards K-12 education, and finessed other areas of the budget to avoid raising taxes even more.\n\"Had we just left everything as is, and added our education spending, we would have to raise taxes that much more to cover everything,\" Anderson said.\nRepublican Assemblywoman Jill Dickman, a finance committee member who voted against the tax increase, recalled roughly the same amount of cuts as claimed by Anderson and said lawmakers spent a huge amount of time reviewing spending and ways to save money.\n\"That\u2019s all we did, was go through the budget,\" she said\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefining a \"spending cut\" can be subjective \u2014 lawmakers \"cut\" around $108 million from the governor\u2019s recommended budget and \"cut\" from specific line items and programs, but it\u2019s less clear if those translated into net savings. Either way, the savings make up a small percentage of the $7.3 billion two-year budget, especially including the $1.4 billion in new and extended taxes.\nTarkanian said he didn\u2019t mean to imply that no spending cuts at all were made, but instead bemoaned the wasted opportunity to create \"substantive\" changes in three areas: collective bargaining, public employee retirement benefits and prevailing wages (mandatory minimum pay for contractors on publicly-funded projects).\nLooking back at the legislative session, lawmakers generally backed more even-keeled legislation rather than sweeping changes favored by some Republican legislators.\nA wide-ranging effort dubbed \"Union Armageddon\" failed to make much headway, while a Roberson-sponsored bill changing several portions of collective bargaining law for school administrators and teachers passed with nearly unanimous support.\nRoberson also sponsored a widely supported bill amending the state\u2019s public employee retirement system and helped usher through another effort lowering the prevailing wage on school construction projects (a concession from an earlier bill that eliminated it entirely).\nThe right-leaning Nevada Policy Research Institute agreed with Tarkanian, and complained that some of Roberson\u2019s bills only created \"cosmetic changes,\" whereas other proposed Republican legislation had the potential to severely disrupt the status quo.\n\"It\u2019s easy to argue that none of these initiatives did much to pull back the wasteful spending of tax dollars, but they were certainly billed as attempts to do so,\" NPRI spokesman Michael\u00a0Schaus said in an email. \"The best I can say is that there were virtually no cuts to the largest drivers of state spending.\"\nRoberson\u2019s campaign claims the PERS legislation, which slightly lowers benefits to new recipients and made several other changes, would save the system $1 billion every decade once fully implemented.\nBut the vast majority of changes in the bill only apply to new employees, meaning it will take decades for any significant savings to be realized. The entitlement board testified that the legislation would have a \"positive impact on the long term financing,\" but it couldn\u2019t predict an exact savings amount due to the long time period in which the savings would take place.\nThe campaign also noted that Roberson and other lawmakers cut more than $500 million from the state budget in 2011 to make up for sagging state revenues after the foreclosure crisis, making it difficult to find new areas to cut in 2015.\nOur ruling\nTarkanian says that the Republican-controlled Legislature \"didn\u2019t do one single thing to cut spending\" in the face of historic tax increases.\nTaken straightforwardly, Tarkanian\u2019s claim isn\u2019t true \u2014 lawmakers shaved off around $150 million in spending between the last two budgets, and approved several bills designed to rein in entitlement spending over the long run. There\u2019s a sliver of truth in Tarkanian\u2019s follow-up, as Republican legislative leadership generally stuck with less severe changes to major state spending drivers like collective bargaining and public employee retirement than what was prefered by more conservative groups and legislators.\nBut to say lawmakers didn\u2019t do anything to address spending isn\u2019t accurate.\nWe rate his statement as Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05225"}
