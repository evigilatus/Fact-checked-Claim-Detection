Terry McAuliffe, Democratic leaders in the House and Senate, and Republican Sen. John Watkins of Powhatan.\nThe Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, gives states the option of expanding Medicaid eligibility to people earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty line, about $16,104 in a one-person household and $21,707 \u00a0in a two-person household. Uncle Sam will pick up the entire tab for new enrollees during the next three years and pay 90 percent of the cost down the road.\nThe House has twice refused to broaden the program, saying the federal government can\u2019t be trusted to pay its promised share. A stalemate between the House and the Democratic-controlled Senate is delaying passage of a two-year state budget.\nAshley Bauman, a spokeswoman for the state Democratic Party, said the $5 million-a- day figure originates from The Commonwealth Institute for Fiscal Analysis, a think tank that analyzes state policies with a focus on their effects on low- and moderate-income people. In February 2013, it released a one-page paper saying if Virginia expanded Medicaid eligibility by the start of 2014, \"the state would be able to draw down about $5 million per day in federal funds.\"\nMichael Cassidy, president of the institute, told us it used 2012 estimates by the state\u2019s Medicaid agency of the amount of federal money that would flow into Virginia if the Old Dominion began expansion on Jan. 1, 2014 -- the earliest date permissible. Such action would bring $2.99 billion of federal money into the state between the start of 2014 through June 30, 2015, the agency projected.\nThe Commonwealth Institute then divided the $3 billion by the number of days in the span, 546. The daily cost to the federal government would be $5,494,505.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Virginia\u2019s Medicaid agency has since lowered its estimate of expansion costs. Its actuary, Pricewaterhouse Coopers, found that the cost per new enrollee has been lower than expected in states that have expanded their programs. That\u2019s because the new Medicaid recipients are less likely to be disabled or require long-term care than those who already had been receiving benefits.\nThe new estimates were released in January 2014. Assuming that expansion in Virginia would begin this July 1, the state\u2019s Medicaid agency estimated it would receive $1,264,366,699 in new federal payments through June 30, 2015. That breaks down to $3,464,018 a day.\nThe total federal dollars will increase over the decade as more people enroll in expanded Medicaid. The agency projects it would receive an extra $1,655,080,206 from Washington \u00a0during the state budget year that begins July 1, 2015. That breaks down to $4,522,077 a day.\nOur ruling\nThe state Democratic Party says Virginia is losing out on $5 million a day in federal funding by not expanding its Medicaid program. It throws that figure at the feet of the Republican-led House of Delegates, which twice has rejected expansion.\nNo doubt, there\u2019s a tremendous amount of federal money at stake. As many as 400,000 Virginians could become eligible for Medicaid under Obamacare, and the U.S. would pay their entire health care costs through 2016. \u00a0\nBut the $5 million-a-day figure comes from an old state estimate. The most recent estimate of expansion costs, released in January, breaks down to about $3.5 million a day for the budget year that starts this July 1. The federal contribution would be about $4.5 million a day during the following budget year, starting in mid-2015.\nThat\u2019s lots of money, but not as much as the Democrats say the House is now bypassing.
