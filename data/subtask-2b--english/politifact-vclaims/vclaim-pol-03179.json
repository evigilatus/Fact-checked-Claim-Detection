Others already announced include California Treasurer John Chiang; Delaine Eastin, the state\u2019s former superintendent for public instruction; and Gavin Newsom, the state\u2019s current lieutenant governor.\nRepublican candidates include State Assemblyman Travis Allen of Orange County; John Cox, a venture capitalist from San Diego County and Rosie Grier, a Hall of Fame professional football player.\nA poll released in June 2017 showed a tightening race. Newsom was in the lead among all candidates, with 22 percent support from likely voters. Villaraigosa had 17 percent support, up from his 11 percent three months earlier.\nAs part of our Tracking The Truth series, PolitiFact California is fact-checking claims in the 2018 governor\u2019s race.\n\nTracking the Truth: Hear a claim you want fact-checked?

He made the False claim that California is currently home to one-quarter of the nation\u2019s 300 poorest cities. He mischaracterized the results of a study, which relied on data from 2013, when many of the state\u2019s cities had not yet recovered from the Great Recession. Today, many of those same cities have experienced strong economic improvement.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin Nunes\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in an interview on Fox\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRepublicans have no way to communicate\u201d after tech companies cut off Parler.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Amy Sherman \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSixth largest economy in the world? \nTurning to Villaraigosa\u2019s bold claim involving the economy and poverty, we\u2019ll start by checking the first part: that California has the \"sixth largest economy in the world.\"\nThis is a talking point California leaders love to make on national and international stages.\nWe fact-checked this hypothetical comparison of the state\u2019s economy against that of nations in July 2016 when State Senate Leader Kevin de Le\u00f3n made the same assertion at the Democratic National Convention.\nWe rated it Mostly True based on California\u2019s 2.4 trillion GDP in 2015, which ranked sixth behind the United States, China, Japan, Germany and the United Kingdom and slightly above France and Brazil. The rankings came from the Brown Administration, which analyzed figures from the International Monetary Fund\u2019s World Economic Outlook Database.\nThe claim missed a completely True rating because it ignored California\u2019s sky high cost of living and Silicon Valley\u2019s outsized role in the state\u2019s economic growth, which speaks to Villaraigosa\u2019s description of unequal economies across the state.\nIn a separate set of rankings, the California Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office, adjusting for the state\u2019s high cost of living, reported in 2016 that the state\u2019s GDP ranking dropped to 11th in the world. That placed it just below France and just above Mexico.\nThe Brown Administration, not including cost of living, recently updated the GDP rankings for 2016. California\u2019s now $2.60 trillion GDP remained in the sixth spot, though it was just a tick behind the United Kingdom\u2019s $2.62 trillion economy.\n\nVillaraigosa\u2019s statement is accurate, but needs the same clarification about the state\u2019s high cost of living.\nOne of the highest poverty rates?\nThe second part of Villaraigosa\u2019s claim is that California has one of the \"highest poverty rates.\" We interpreted this to mean compared with other states in the nation.\nWe know the state has struggled mightily with poverty. As an example, we rated True a claim by Republican Assembly Leader Chad Mayes in January that California has \"the highest poverty rate in the nation\" when comparing states and considering cost-of-living.\nAt 20.6 percent, California\u2019s poverty rate in 2015 was well above the national average of 15.1 percent, according to a U.S. Census Bureau report that factors in cost-of-living. Florida\u2019s 19 percent poverty rate ranked second.\nUnlike Mayes\u2019 statement on poverty, however, Villaraigosa\u2019s claim makes no mention of cost-of-living. Ignoring this factor, California would have the 17th highest poverty rate, not the first, according to the census bureau.\nVillaraigosa\u2019s statement needs this key clarification.\nOur ruling\nAntonio Villaraigosa recently claimed California has \"the sixth largest economy in the world\" and one of the highest poverty rates\" in the nation.\nThe facts show Villaraigosa was correct on both points. He omitted, however, the key point that California\u2019s high cost-of-living drags down its economic output and accelerates its poverty. The candidate for governor\u2019s statements would benefit from this additional information.\nWe rate Villaraigosa\u2019s claim Mostly True.\n\nMOSTLY TRUE\u00a0\u2013 The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03179"}
