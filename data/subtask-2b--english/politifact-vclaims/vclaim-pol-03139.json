I would like to see them go even lower.\"\nGas prices are the lowest in the U.S. in over ten years! I would like to see them go even lower.\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 4, 2017\n\nWe are fairly certain we know what Trump meant to say. But that's not what he said.\u00a0(The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article.)\nWhat Trump likely meant to say\nOn the one hand, the American Automobile Association told PolitiFact that gasoline prices on Independence Day weekend were the lowest they have been in 12 years -- since 2005.\n\"Gas prices have been declining since the beginning of June,\" said Jeanette Casselano, a spokesperson for AAA. \"At $2.23, today\u2019s national gas price average is the cheapest price we\u2019ve seen since January. \"The combination of tepid demand and increasing gasoline and crude output continues to put downward pressure on gas prices, and motorists are benefitting.\"\nThere\u2019s value in comparing gas prices using a narrow window of time like the July 4 weekend, because comparing, for example, summer prices to winter prices is like comparing apples and oranges.\nWhat Trump actually said\nHowever, the way Trump phrased his tweet was more expansive. Rather than limiting the comparison to the July 4 weekend, the tweet suggests that at no point over the last decade-plus have gas prices been lower.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd that would not be correct, according to data from the Energy Information Administration, a federal office.\n\nThere were 85 weeks in which gas cost less than $2.26 per gallon, the price it was at the time of Trump\u2019s tweet. That means that for about one-sixth of the time over the last decade, gas cost less than it does now. (The EIA data does mirror AAA\u2019s assessment for Fourth of July weekend prices.)\nThe Energy Information Administration\u2019s data set uses nominal dollars rather than inflation-adjusted dollars, so just to be certain, we ran the data through the federal inflation calculator to see how adjusting for inflation affected that number. The answer: 58 weeks. That\u2019s still about one-ninth of the last decade.\nTrump's role in gas prices\nThen there\u2019s the question of whether Trump deserves bragging rights. In general, presidents have rarely had a direct impact on the price of gasoline, said Philip Verleger, an economist and head of the energy consulting firm PKVerleger LLC.\n\"The only one who had an impact was Jimmy Carter, who instituted price controls that managed to ball up the distribution of gasoline, leading to lines at gas stations,\" he said. Overall, presidents are \"not a big factor\" on gasoline prices, he said.\nIndeed, gas cost less during much of President Barack Obama\u2019s last year in office than it does now.\nOur ruling\nTrump tweeted, \"Gas prices are the lowest in the U.S. in over ten years!\"\nTrump likely meant to say that gas prices on the July 4 weekend are lower now than at any point since 2005. But Trump tweeted something\u00a0more sweeping -- that gas prices haven\u2019t been lower in more than a decade. That\u2019s not correct.\nAs such,we rate the statement Mostly False.\n Share the Facts 2017-07-06 16:07:14 UTC   PolitiFact    3 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly False  \"Gas prices are the lowest in the U.S. in over ten years!\"    Donald Trump President   a tweet Tuesday, July 4, 2017 2017-07-04    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03139"}
