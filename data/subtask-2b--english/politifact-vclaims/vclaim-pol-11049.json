Even so, in August 2010 we wrote that 18 percent of Americans believed he was a Muslim, up from 11 percent in March 2009, according to Pew Research Center data. A Time poll also released in 2010 claimed the number was 24 percent.\n\nOften linked is the belief that Obama was not born in the United States. Here, too, PolitiFact has debunked numerous related claims, many involving the president\u2019s birth certificate.\n\nWe asked Hinojosa, a lawyer and former Cameron County judge, for backup on his claim about the \"large majority\" of Republicans. He said he\u2019d seen \"numerous publications and blogs where that fact is mentioned.\" He provided no documentation.\n\nAmericans have indeed been polled many times on these questions, sometimes in conjunction with news items such as plans for a mosque near the site of 9/11\u2019s terrorist attacks in New York (a big topic in August 2010); Obama releasing his long-form Hawaii birth certificate (April 27, 2011) and the killing of Osama bin Laden (May 2, 2011).\n\nA two-state poll touched off headlines in March 2012, the month before Hinojosa\u2019s remark. Public Policy Polling, a Democratic-oriented firm, found that among residents who said they planned to vote in their upcoming GOP primary, 52 percent in Alabama and 42 percent in Mississippi said they believed Obama was a Muslim.\n\nThat \"Southern Swing\" poll got a lot of press and social media reaction -- more so than the same pollsters\u2019 March 2012 results from Obama\u2019s home state of Illinois, in which 39 percent of likely GOP primary voters said he was Muslim and 36 percent said he was foreign-born.\n\nThen again, the \"Southern Swing\" ran about 48 states shy of the whole country, and only counted a subset of Republicans.\n\nWe found eight national polls, from March 2009 through May 2011, that asked these questions and broke down results by respondents\u2019 political affiliation.\n\nSeveral pollsters cautioned against a too-literal reading of their results, noting a polling phenomenon that ABC News described in an Aug. 30, 2010, blog post: \"Some people who strongly oppose a person or proposition will take virtually any opportunity to express that antipathy. Offer a negative attribute, they\u2019ll grab it.\"\n\nWe\u2019ve posted details from these polls in chart form online. In this story, for simplicity\u2019s sake, we\u2019ll showcase the highest and lowest percentage of responses for each of the two questions.\n\nOn Obama\u2019s religion, the biggest percentage of Republicans answering \"Muslim\" was 46 percent in an August 2010 Time poll. The lowest was 17 percent in a March 2009 Pew Research Center for People & the Press poll.\n\nOn Obama being born outside the country, the highest result was 43 percent of Republicans in an April 2011 USA Today/Gallup poll. The lowest was 14 percent in an April-May 2011 Washington Post poll.\n\nSo, a \"large majority\" of Republicans did not endorse either of these answers.\n\nStill, there is another definition of \"majority\" that could be applied: \"the greatest share,\" as in the type of election where the candidate with the most votes wins. And in three of the polls, \"Muslim\" and \"foreign born\" were the answers most often given by Republicans.\n\nIn the Time poll, that 46 percent who answered \"Muslim\" is nearly double the Republicans giving the next-most popular answer (24 percent who said \"Christian\"). In the USA Today/Gallup poll, 43 percent is one-and-three-quarter times as much as the 25 percent who answered \"definitely\" or \"probably\" born in the U.S. In contrast, a February-March 2011 Pew poll on birthplace was more evenly split, with the 37 percent of Republicans who answered that Obama was born in \"another country\" edging out the 33 percent who said \"United States\" and 30 percent who said they didn\u2019t know or declined to answer.\n\nHinojosa didn\u2019t respond when we shared these poll results.\n\nOur ruling\n\nNational polls consistently show less than half -- sometimes much less than half -- of Republicans saying Obama is a Muslim or born abroad, though both falsehoods have sometimes been the No. 1 Republican responses.\n\nRegardless, there is no indication that a \"large majority\" of Republicans believe Obama is a Muslim or that he was born abroad. Hinojosa\u2019s statement rates False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 23, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBiden invested the entire family fortune in Ukraine gas and oil.
