Let\u2019s start with some background.\nThe official election count, certified Nov. 25, named Herring the winner by 165 votes, or 0.007 percent of the more than 2.2 million ballots cast. Obenshain filed a recount petition on Nov. 27.\nThe recount will simply retabulate results from Nov. 5 election. Vote tallies can change if:\n* the results were incorrectly counted;\n* some ballots were included that should have been ruled invalid;\n* if apparent undervotes or overvotes were not tallied but should have been. Undervotes occur when voters fail to clearly select a candidate. Overvotes occur when voters appear to mark more than one candidate in a race.\nNow, let\u2019s return to Obenshain\u2019s statement on recounts in other states.\nPaul Logan, a spokesman for Obenshain\u2019s campaign, said the statistic came from a report by The Center for Voting and Democracy from 2011. Of the 2,884 statewide general elections in the U.S. from 2000 to 2009, only 18 had recounts and 11 had a margin of victory of 0.15 percent or less. The average margin swing was 296 votes in those 18 recounts and the median swing was 229 votes.\nThe report cited four recounts in the past decade in which the winner and leading loser were divided by 300 votes. Other than Virginia\u2019s attorney general election, there have been no races between candidates to add to the list since 2009.\nHere\u2019s what happened in the other states:\nMontana, 2000\nAbout 63,000 people cast ballots in the Democratic primary for superintendent of public school instruction and only 64 votes separated the top two candidates. Linda McCulloch maintained her lead through the recount, eventually beating Gail Gray by 61 votes.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWashington, 2004\nDemocrat Christine Gregoire won the governor\u2019s race after a second recount -- by hand -- gave her a 130-vote edge over Republican Dino Rossi out of 2.7 million ballots cast. Rossi had won the original count by 261 votes and an automatic machine recount by 42 votes. During the hand recount, 700 additional absentee ballots from King County were included that had originally been wrongly disqualified. Republican unsuccessfully challenged the results in court and legal wranglings continued well into the following year.\nVermont, 2006\nOn election night, counters incorrectly transferred results on tally sheets in the state auditors race, crediting some votes for a third-party candidate instead of the Democratic challenger, Thomas Salmon. The mistakes happened in a few communities that used paper ballots. During a recount, 239 votes changed. Salmon, originally runner-up, \u00a0won by 102 votes over Republican incumbent Randy Brock.\nMinnesota, 2008\nIncumbent U.S. Sen. Norm Coleman, a Republican, won the original count over Democrat Al Franken by 215 votes out of 2.4 million cast ballots. During a hand recount, Coleman maintained a 192-vote lead. But challenges which were eventually settled by the Minnesota Supreme Court led, among other things \u00a0to the counting of nearly 1,000 absentee ballots that were initially excluded. In the end, Franken won by 312 votes.\nTwo experts told us there are important differences between what happened in the other states and Virginia. The experts were Charles Stewart III, a political scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Edward Foley, a professor at Ohio State University\u2019s Moritz College of Law, who is writing a book on the history of disputed elections in the United States.\nBecause Virginia largely votes by electronic process, they say a smaller percentage of ballots from the attorney general race will be subjected to hand recounting than were in Washington and Minnesota. Experts also note that Washington and Minnesota had more liberal voting laws than Virginia that led to the addition of some ballots for counting during the recounts in both of those states.\n\"Experts are assuming the change is going to be tiny,\" Stewart said. \u00a0\"But even a tiny change could affect the outcome, although that\u2019s highly unlikely, at this point.\"\nIn Virginia, ballots ruled invalid in the original count cannot be reintroduced. To include additional ballots -- which may have been improperly excluded -- a candidate must contest the race to the General Assembly, \u00a0which is a step beyond a recount. \u00a0\nVirginia also requires that all optical scan ballots, in which voters mark their preferences by filling in circles or squares similar to those found on standardized tests, be included in recounts. They will be re-run through tabulation machines; overvotes and undervotes will be weeded out and counted manually. The Virginia Public Access Project estimated that more than 700,000 optical scan ballots were cast in the November election.\nIn addition, the process will include a hand count of absentee and provisional ballots, a tally of tapes printed by direct-recording electronic voting machines, and reprint and recount of any illegible tapes printed on election night.\nOur ruling\nObenshain said that three of the four statewide races this century within a 300-vote margin have been overturned in a recount.\nHe\u2019s right, although sets of circumstances in these three upturned elections in other states do not translate to the Virginia recount that Obenshain hopes will improve his second-place finish in last month\u2019s attorney general race.
