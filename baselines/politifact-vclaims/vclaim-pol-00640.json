You do", "text": "As President Donald Trump has upped the ante in his tariff war with China, he\u2019s consistently argued that consumers shouldn\u2019t be worried.\nTrump has slapped China with a 25 percent tariff on $200 billion of goods and floated the possibility of tariffs on $325 billion in additional Chinese goods. China, meanwhile, prepared to impose retaliatory tariffs on $60 billion in American products.\nIn remarks at the White House on May 9, Trump said, \"So our country can take in $120 billion a year in tariffs, paid for mostly by China, by the way, not by us. A lot of people try and steer it in a different direction. It\u2019s really paid \u2014 ultimately, it\u2019s paid for by \u2014 largely, by China. And businesses will pour back into our country.\"\nHe reiterated that argument in a May 13 tweetstorm, saying that \"there is no reason for the U.S. Consumer to pay the Tariffs, which take effect on China today.\" Trump suggested some alternatives \u2014 buying from suppliers in a country without tariffs, or buying from an American company.\nHis repeated message is that Americans shouldn\u2019t worry about the economic impact of his tariffs, couching his claim by saying it's \"mostly,\" \"really,\" \"largely\" or \"ultimately\" paid for by China. Despite the hedging words he uses, experts told us\u00a0the president is wrong to offer that sort of assurance.\n\"It is inaccurate to say that \u2018countries pay\u2019 tariffs on commercial and consumer goods \u2014 it is the buyers and sellers that bear the costs,\" said Ross Burkhart, a Boise State University political scientist. \"Purchasers pay the tariff when they buy popular products. Sellers lose market share when their products get priced out of markets.\"\nThe White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article.\nWhy are tariffs levied?\nThe idea behind imposing tariffs is to make American companies more competitive with their foreign counterparts. As those companies prosper, the thinking goes, they can hire more workers and pay their employees better. Those workers, in turn, would have more money to spend, and that helps spread those dollars around the economy more broadly.\nEconomists told us, however, that real-world examples of tariffs working as intended are rare, and consumers of the tariff-levying country are the primary victims of tariffs, by having to pay higher prices.\nThe federal treasury does get paid when tariffs are levied. But Chinese exporters don\u2019t make the payment. The importers do \u2014 usually U.S. companies.\n\"If the U.S. imposes a tariff on Chinese televisions, the duty is paid to U.S. Customs and Border Protection at the border by a U.S. broker representing a U.S. importer \u2014 say, Costco,\" Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, wrote in September. \"The Chinese government pays nothing.\"\nCustoms and Border Protection typically requires payment within 10 days of their shipments clearing customs, Reuters reported. Companies that don\u2019t pay their amount by that date are sent a new bill.\nHow does the cost of a tariff get passed to consumers?\nWhen the tariff is small, an importer may elect to keep its prices stable rather than pass the tariff cost along to the consumer. But experts say that\u2019s not the most common decision for the types of tariffs at issue in the current U.S.-China trade war.\n\"When tariffs are levied at 10 percent, many firms choose to absorb the cost in their margins,\" said Monica de Bolle, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. This can be done by settling for lower profit margins or cutting costs in some fashion.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"However, with tariffs now scaled up to 25 percent, firms will inevitably pass on some or all of the increase to U.S. consumers,\" de Bolle said. \"That means that U.S. consumers could in some cases pay 25 percent more for a given good than they did before.\"\nMeanwhile, tariffs could mean that producers pay more, as materials that are used to make products sold in the United States rise in price. Those price increases are likely to be passed on to consumers as well. It\u2019s possible that U.S. consumers could find tariff-free products elsewhere, but in many cases, a suitable product may not be available, or may be more expensive or of lower quality.\nIn addition, tariffs could also produce delays or price spikes that spiral across the economy, since the economy is now tightly interwoven into complex and time-sensitive \"supply chains.\" And any slowdown in the supply chain could mean layoffs for producers and a hit to the broader U.S. economy.\nBecause studies have shown that lower-income Americans tend to spend a larger fraction of their income on goods, they could feel the pinch worse than more affluent Americans do.\nU.S. producers selling to China would be hurt by retaliatory tariffs, given the large Chinese share of certain American agricultural exports, such as soybeans. Finally, Gleckman wrote, a decline in overseas competition hurts consumers by making them more reliant on less competitive firms with higher prices.\nHow big could the impact be on the U.S. economy?\nAll estimates of the potential economic hit from the Trump tariffs are subject to some degree of speculation. However, the Congressional Research Service recently reviewed a range of professional estimates and found that they\u00a0\"generally suggest a moderately negative impact.\"\nOne recent study by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Princeton University, and Columbia University concluded that \"the full incidence of the tariff falls on domestic consumers, with a reduction in U.S. real income of $1.4 billion per month by the end of 2018.\"\nThe Congressional Budget Office projected a 0.1 percent decline in the annual U.S. GDP growth rate. The International Monetary Fund projected a 0.2 percent decline in the annual U.S. GDP growth rate.\nA variety of companies have reported harm from the U.S. and retaliatory tariffs, including Walmart, Caterpillar and Tyson Foods, CRS reported.\nThe U.S. bears the brunt from tariffs, but China could suffer, too.\nFacing higher prices for Chinese goods, U.S. consumers may choose to buy fewer Chinese goods, thereby hurting China\u2019s gross domestic product. But that\u2019s not even certain, since China could conceivably make up those sales, or many of those sales, elsewhere.\nDon\u2019t tariffs produce revenue?\nTariffs do generate some revenue, but economists say it\u2019s not wise to count on tariffs for this purpose.\nAccording to the Congressional Research Service, revenues from the Trump-imposed tariffs through Feb. 21, 2019, have totaled about $18.5 billion.\nHowever, that\u2019s just 2 percent of the federal budget deficit, most recently estimated at $896 billion.\nOur ruling\nTrump said that tariffs are \"paid for mostly by China, by the way, not by us.\"\nChina doesn\u2019t pay the initial tariffs \u2014 U.S. importers do. In many if not most cases, those costs are passed on to American consumers, whether it\u2019s directly on the products hit by the tariffs or through an impact on U.S. companies who use raw materials hit with tariffs. China could also take a hit over the longer term in its gross domestic product, but experts say the harm to the U.S. economy would be swifter, more certain and potentially bigger.\nWe rate the statement False.\n Share the Facts 2019-05-14 15:26:19 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  Tariffs are \"paid for mostly by China, by the way, not by us.\"    Donald Trump President https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-ending-surprise-medical-billing/   remarks at the White House Thursday, May 9, 2019 2019-05-09    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00640"}
