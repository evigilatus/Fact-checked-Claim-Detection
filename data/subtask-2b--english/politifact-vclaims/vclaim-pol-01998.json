Kevin Cramer, a Republican, lurked in the background. Cramer shot back that Heitkamp only discovered an interest in relieving regulations for banks after Cramer applied pressure.\n\"We\u2019ve sent over 40 of these types of bills to the Senate she\u2019s never been interested in, until all of a sudden I become a candidate for the Senate and put pressure,\" Cramer told conservative radio host Rob Port. \"All of a sudden she\u2019s for a little bit of regulatory relief, and when I say little, I mean very little regulatory relief for the banking industry.\"\nWe were curious: Did Heitkamp\u2019s interest in regulatory relief flower overnight? It\u2019s something other Democrats have criticized her for, so we wondered if it was an election-year stance.\nA review of the evidence shows that Heitkamp has been working on banking issues since she was elected in 2012. She joined the Senate Banking Committee in 2013.\nHeitkamp cosponsored the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, the law in question, on Nov. 16, 2017. Cramer announced his candidacy on Feb. 16, 2018.\nHeitkamp\u2019s office said she has been working on the current law since 2013. She has also held over two dozen Senate Banking Committee hearings since 2015 on financial regulatory reform and over 30 discussions with top financial regulators.\nHeitkamp cosponsored a bill that was folded into law in 2015 to eliminate annual privacy notifications from banks, which cut red tape for community banks and credit unions.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

But the bills Cramer provided as evidence were more extreme and unlikely to garner Democratic support, Blackwell said.\nOur ruling\nCramer said Heitkamp has \"never been interested in\" regulatory relief for banks \"until all of a sudden I become a candidate for the Senate and put pressure on.\"\nHeitkamp has been an advocate of regulatory relief for small banks since she ran for the Senate in 2012. Cramer announced his Senate bid in February. Heitkamp\u2019s lack of support for the regulatory relief that Cramer supports does not mean she is disinterested in regulatory relief.\nWe rate this statement False.\n Share the Facts 2018-06-04 19:45:46 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  Says Heidi Heitkamp has \"never been interested in\" regulatory relief \"until all of a sudden I become a candidate for the Senate and put pressure on.\"    Kevin Cramer U.S. House Representative from North Dakota https://www.wday.com/entertainment/radio/4453587-970-wday-demand-rob-rereport-53018   In an interview Wednesday, May 30, 2018 2018-05-30    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01998"}
