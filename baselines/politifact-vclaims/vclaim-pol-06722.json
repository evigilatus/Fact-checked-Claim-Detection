Under state law, lobbyists are required to register with the commission and list their clients annually; the filings are available online.\nBy phone, Natalia Ashley of the Texas Ethics Commission staff said whenever a lobbyist gets a client, he or she must amend their registration. When this happens, the agency\u2019s public lobbyist-client lists are updated, she said. And when there is an update, she said, the new breakdown replaces the previous version posted online, \"so we don\u2019t keep a printed document for each update.\"\nStill with us? This was significant for our purposes, we realized, because a lobbyist-client list for 2015 about the moment Claunch spoke wasn\u2019t readily available to us a few days later. By the time we inquired, that particular list had been overtaken online by updated versions possibly presenting information that would not have existed when Claunch spoke. To fairly check his claim, then, we considered a next-best thing, the agency\u2019s lobbyist-client list for cities covering 2014.\nAnd according to that 2014 Lobby List, updated by the state Jan. 9, 2015, the City of Austin had 22 state-registered lobbyists in 2014, a total greater than the count shown for any of 89 other municipalities. The City of Irving, between Dallas and Fort Worth, came in second with 13. West Lake Hills had four people registered.\nTop 5 Texas Cities Based on Number of Registered Outside Lobbyists (2014)\n\n\n\n\n\nCITY\n\n\nSTATE-REGISTERED LOBBYISTS\n\n\n\n\nAustin\n\n\n22\n\n\n\n\nIrving\n\n\n13\n\n\n\n\nFort Worth\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\nHouston\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\nSan Antonio\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Texas Ethics Commission, 2014 Lobby List with Concerns (Employers and Clients), Jan. 9, 2015 (downloaded Feb. 4, 2015)\nA complication?\nWe wondered if those reported counts made this a slam-dunk claim. Possibly not, a City of Austin official suggested. John Hrncir, a city governmental relations officer, told us that even though 22 people were listed as lobbying for the city in 2014, he directly consulted with less than half that many.\nSimilarly, a City of San Antonio official said by phone the number of lobbyists shown in state filings as representing that city do not reflect the lobbyists he regularly consults. Jeff Coyle, San Antonio\u2019s director of intergovernmental relations, said he communicates actively with about four or five of San Antonio\u2019s nine contracted lobbyists.\nBrie Franco, legislative attorney for the City of El Paso, said by phone that she talks directly to three of the four lobbyists listed as representing the city in state records. El Paso hired the firm Focused Advocacy to represent its interests in the legislative session, the same firm enlisted by West Lake Hills.\nHrncir said that when a lobbying firm tells the ethics commission its clients and expected payments, the firm may specify all employees with any possibility of doing work on behalf of the city.\nWe ran Hrncir\u2019s analysis by Jack Gullahorn, president of the Professional Advocacy Association of Texas, which says it\u2019s the only recognized statewide association for the lobby and government affairs community. By phone, Gullahorn said Hrncir was correct and added that the entirety of lobbyists in a firm routinely register for all of the clients listed underneath the firm even though someone at the practice may be the primary contact. Lobbyists do this \"to be conservative in following the law,\" Gullahorn said, by ensuring they don\u2019t get in trouble with the state if someone is found lobbying for the city without reporting that in advance. According to an ethics commission report on laws affecting lobbyists, each lobbyist must provide information about each client \u00a0that employs, retains or reimburses them to lobby.\nSpending on lobbyists\nIt\u2019s one thing for Austin to have the most lobbyists indicating they\u2019re out there walking the pink building on its behalf. We also looked into how the city stacks up in spending on contract lobbyists at the Capitol.\nAccording to a resolution approved without debate at the Austin City Council\u2019s Nov. 20, 2014, meeting, council members agreed to contract with 10 lobbying firms for the 2015 legislative session for an amount not to exceed $805,000 all together. But there were a couple changes after that, Hrncir said, because lobbyists Randy Erben and Luis Saenz joined the administration of Gov. Greg Abbott. Hrncir said the city made an individual contract with Brian Yarbrough, Erben\u2019s previous partner. Jennifer Rodriguez from McGuireWoods Consulting was to assume Saenz\u2019s role on the city\u2019s part, Hrncir said.\nLobby Firms Hired by City of Austin Before 2015 Legislative Session\n\n\n\n\n\nFIRM\n\n\nMAXIMUM AMOUNT THE FIRM OR LOBBYIST EXPECTS FROM THE CITY FOR LOBBYING\n\n\n\n\nNora Del Bosque\n\n\n$65,000\n\n\n\n\nRandall Erben*/Erben & Yarbrough\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$90,000\n\n\n\n\nMarta Greytok Consulting\n\n\n$90,000\n\n\n\n\nCliff Johnson\n\n\n$90,000\n\n\n\n\nDemetrius McDaniel/GreenbergTaurig\n\n\n$90,000\n\n\n\n\nClayton Pope\n\n\n$90,000\n\n\n\n\nLuis Saenz*/McGuireWoods Consulting\n\n\n$70,000\n\n\n\n\nTrent Townsend/Imperium Public Affairs\n\n\n$65,000\n\n\n\n\nJoe D.
