On the dates of those meetings, he was paid for lucrative speaking appearances elsewhere.\n\n\nOn April 11-12, 2006, the first official meeting of the Iraq Study Group was held in Washington, D.C. Where was Giuliani? On April 12, he was a keynote speaker at the FT Asian Financial Centers Summit in South Korea. His net fee: $160,000.\n\n\nThe second official meeting of the group was May 18-19, 2006. Where was Giuliani? On May 18, he spoke at the Georgia 100 annual awards breakfast in Atlanta. His net fee: $80,000. Later that day, he attended a $100-a-plate fundraiser for former Christian Coalition leader Ralph Reed, then a candidate for lieutenant governor of Georgia.\n\n\nJames Baker, secretary of state under the first President Bush, was co-chair of the Iraq Study Group, along with former U.S. Rep.
