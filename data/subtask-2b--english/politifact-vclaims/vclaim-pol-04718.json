But that's not his only record", "text": "They say the third time\u2019s the charm.\nFor Donald Trump, his third claim about a historic showing in the GOP primary finally hit the mark. First, he jumped the gun. Next, he exaggerated his margin of victory. But in a speech in Raleigh on July 5, Trump accurately described his historic accomplishment.\n\"We got the highest vote count in the history of the Republican Party,\" he said, speaking just of the primary elections \u2013 since, of course, the general election hasn\u2019t happened yet.\nHow did Trump avoid some of the pitfalls he has made in the past with this unexpectedly tricky claim?\nIn April, he claimed he had received the most votes of any Republican nominee ever.\nPolitiFact rated that False, because he had not received the most votes ever. However, as the article noted, Trump did have the chance to reach that milestone with strong showings in some upcoming primaries.\nThen on June 1, Trump said he had broken the record by millions of votes. PolitiFact rated that statement False as well. Trump had finally broken the record, but only by a small amount.\n\"Had Trump made a correct claim in one breath only to mangle the truth in the next?\" we asked.\nYes, he had.\nBut he finally\u00a0got it right by avoiding any embellishment, and just sticking to the claim of a record-breaking victory.\nAccording to Real Clear Politics, Trump received about 13.3 million votes during the primary. That\u2019s about 1.8 million votes more than the previous record, held by George W. Bush.\nBasking in the record\nOn Tuesday, Trump spoke about winning in face of a crowded primary field and a \"rigged system,\" then name-dropped some GOP elders whose vote totals he\u00a0eclipsed.\n\"Not only did the Republican party go way up from what it was four years ago \u2013 way, way up \u2013 but Donald Trump, in the history of the primary system, Republican Party, with 17 people running \u2013 a lot of people don\u2019t understand, when you say 17 people \u2013 I got almost 14 million votes,\"\u00a0Trump said. \"More than anybody in the history of the Republican Party. More than Ronald Reagan. More than the Bushes. More than Richard Nixon. More than Dwight D. Eisenhower, who did win the second World War; it certainly helped a heck of a lot.\"\n\"We got the highest vote count in the history of the Republican Party,\" he continued. \"It was such a big thing for me. We won 37 states. We got stronger and stronger and stronger.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJenna Wadsworth\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth Carolina Secretary of State Elaine Marshall \"has won more statewide races than probably anyone else alive.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Paul Specht \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA less dubious record\nBut does his record mean that Trump is the most popular Republican candidate ever?\nNo.\nWhat Trump didn\u2019t mention was that during this primary, most Republican voters cast a ballot for someone other than him. More than 16 million people cast votes for another candidate, according to a Washington Post analysis.\nTo be fair, Trump was facing a crowded primary field, which he mentioned in his speech.\nBut 13 of his 16 challengers didn\u2019t make much of a splash. The top three challengers, however \u2013 Ted Cruz, John Kasich and Marco Rubio, in that order \u2013 combined to receive more than 15 million votes.\nSo Trump now holds two GOP primary records: most votes for, and most votes against. Previously, John McCain was the holder of the most-votes-against record.\nAs the national convention approaches, it\u2019s also worth noting that Trump isn\u2019t the only GOP frontrunner to have received less than half of his party\u2019s votes in the primary, but he is one of just a few. The nomination results in past cases have been a mixed bag.\nMcCain won the nomination in 2008 despite receiving less than half the votes, as did Barry Goldwater in 1964. But the frontrunners in 1968 (Ronald Reagan) and 1952 (Robert Taft) went into the convention with less than 50 percent of the primary votes and ended up losing the nomination.\nFinally, it\u2019s worth noting that some historical comparisons of vote totals and percentages are hardly apples-to-apples. The current primary system\u00a0is a relatively new process.\nAs one political scientist previously told PolitiFact, \"Before the 1970s, candidates often did not run in many primaries and caucuses to win delegates\" because party leaders had more influence than they do now, and national conventions were typically contested no matter what.\nOur ruling\nTrump said he got the most votes in the history of the Republican Party primary system.\nThat\u2019s accurate. He received 13.3 million votes, beating George W. Bush\u2019s record of 11.5 million votes.\nYet what Trump failed to mention is that he also holds the record for the most votes cast against a primary candidate, and that he\u2019s one of only a few Republican frontrunners in modern history to have been supported by less\u00a0than half of the party\u2019s primary voters.\nBecause Trump\u2019s claim was accurate but missing that context, we rate this claim Mostly True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/be10f613-3754-43fd-9d02-e89f00619253", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04718"}
