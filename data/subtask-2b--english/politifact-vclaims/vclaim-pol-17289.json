Go ahead and use it if you want. It can be helpful.\"\nLimbaugh read from an article in the Published Reporter, a website based in South Florida. The website wrote that the AMA \"rescinded\" a statement related to hydroxychloroquine.\u00a0\nLimbaugh accused the AMA of \"knowingly lying about hydroxychloroquine.\" But as the Poynter Institute reported, the AMA never retracted its statement on the drug. The Published Reporter and other websites that spread similar claims have walked back their reports, and the AMA addressed the matter on Twitter.\n\"In March, AMA urged caution about prescribing hydroxychloroquine off-label to treat #COVID19,\" the AMA wrote, with a link to Poynter\u2019s Covering COVID-19 newsletter by Al Tompkins. \"Our position remains unchanged. Evidence-based #science & practice must guide these determinations.\"\u00a0\nIn March, AMA urged caution about prescribing hydroxychloroquine off-label to treat #COVID19.

The agency later cautioned against the drug\u2019s use for the virus outside of the hospital setting after a review of safety issues. There is little sign that hydroxychloroquine is effective for coronavirus patients.\nA resolution submitted ahead of a November meeting of the AMA\u2019s policymaking body proposed that the group retract the March statement. The resolution called for an updated statement \"notifying patients that further studies are ongoing\" and supporting physicians\u2019 use of judgment to prescribe the drug off-label to patients with early COVID-19 symptoms.\nThe resolution was not adopted, however. The vote against the measure followed \"fierce opposition,\" MedPage Today reported.\nThe Published Reporter has amended the story Limbaugh cited with a correction in bolded font that said the resolution \"was not accepted.\" Lead Stories also debunked the false claims.\nWe rate Limbaugh\u2019s claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17289"}
