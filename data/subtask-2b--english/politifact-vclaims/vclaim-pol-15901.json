John McCain revived a claim against Barack Obama that\u00a0Obama voted to raise taxes on people making $42,000 a year.\n\n\n\u201cHe voted twice for a budget resolution that increases the taxes on individuals making $42,000 a year,\u201d McCain said in the presidential debate Oct. 15, 2008, at Hofstra University.\n\n\nThis time, McCain correctly noted the tax votes came on budget resolutions. But we\u2019ve reviewed this charge before and found that McCain was stretching the truth. He does again this time, though not as badly.\n\n\nObama voted in March 2008 and June 2008 for budget resolutions. They are blueprints for the federal budget. The resolutions set targets for the committees that write legislation on taxes and spending. The resolutions, approved on mostly party-line votes, expressed support for rolling back tax cuts enacted under President Bush for people making $42,000 a year and higher.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

The resolutions would not change the tax code.\n\n\nMoreover, Obama as a candidate has proposed tax increases for couples earning $250,000 or more a year, or singles earning $200,000 or more.\n\n\nWe rated previous versions of McCain\u2019s charge as Barely True. Although McCain added context to his charge, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that the votes were never expected to raise taxes. So we rate the latest version of McCain\u2019s statement\u00a0Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-15901"}
