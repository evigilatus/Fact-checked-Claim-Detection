Arrests fell also. In sum, they conclude that these actions in late 2016, conservatively calculated, resulted in approximately 236 additional victims killed and over 1,100 additional shootings in 2016 alone.\"\nSessions cited those statistics in stressing the consequences of restraining police. But was the attorney general\u2019s interpretation of the study accurate? And, more significantly, was the research itself academically sound? We decided to take a look.\nThe study\nSessions\u2019s remarks to the police crowd were premised on a significant factual inaccuracy. The ACLU did not sue Chicago over stop-and-frisk, though it had threatened to.\nThe city entered a voluntary agreement to end the policy in August 2015, five months after the Illinois chapter of the civil rights group issued a report indicating Chicagoans were stopped more than four times as much as New Yorkers before that city discontinued stop-and-frisk.\nIn the summer of 2014, Chicago police stopped more than 250,000 people without making an arrest, taking into question the policy\u2019s effectiveness, the ACLU report stated.\nIn the agreement on stop-and-frisk, Chicago police said officers would be trained to stop people for questioning only when there is a \"reasonable suspicion of criminal conduct.\" Also imposed were more thorough requirements for documenting every stop that did occur.\nThe University of Utah research by Paul G. Cassell, a former federal judge and current law professor, and economics professor Richard Fowles found the agreement between Chicago and the ACLU was followed by a steep decline in street stops by police \u2014 from 40,000 monthly down to less than 10,000.\nThe study attributed a surge in homicides, from 480 in 2015 to 754 in 2016, to the sharp reduction in police stops.\nBut the work by Cassell and Fowles has fueled sharp criticism from some criminal justice experts.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in remarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn A. Eterno, a criminal justice professor at Molloy College in Rockville Centre, New York, identified the study\u2019s limited time frame as one flaw. He noted that, while Chicago did indeed jump in 2016 following implementation of the ACLU agreement, they dropped somewhat the following year.\n\"It doesn\u2019t make sense,\" said Eterno, a retired New York City police captain. \"The data is just not there to recommend what (the study) is recommending.\"\nEterno noted that New York City\u2019s murder rate declined or remained steady after it ceased stop-and-frisk \u2014 a fact Casell\u2019s study suggested was an \"anomaly.\" But the cities of Newark, New Jersey; Seattle, Washington; and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, all experienced similar changes to their murder rates after contemplating stop-and-frisk changes, suggesting a broader trend, according to an earlier Washington Post story examining the issue.\nEdwin C. Yohnka, director of communications and public policy for ACLU of Illinois, also questioned the study\u2019s dismissal of other factors potentially contributing to the uptick in murders, such as intense local reaction to public release in late 2015 of police dashcam video that showed a Chicago officer shooting black teenager Laquan McDonald 16 times.\nThe video caused an uproar in Chicago and across the nation and led to the filing of first-degree murder charges against the officer, Jason Van Dyke. Mayor Rahm Emanuel, whose administration fought release of the video in the 2014 shooting for more than a year, also fired his police chief, Garry McCarthy, after a court ordered the footage be made public.\nThe Utah researchers dismissed the video as \"an unlikely candidate to explain the Chicago homicide spike.\" They contended that awareness of Van Dyke\u2019s actions and allegations of a cover-up were \"widespread\" as early as April 2015 when the Chicago City Council agreed to pay McDonald\u2019s family $5 million.\"They say everyone knew what was on the video before it was released,\" Yohnkasaid. \"I don\u2019t think that\u2019s even close to being true.\"Cassell defended his work.\n\"It\u2019s always easy to throw out allegations that something else caused something and how do you falsify that particular claim?\" said Cassell, a former federal judge appointed by President George W. Bush. \"It\u2019s not scientific if you just throw something out and say \u2018well there's no way to test it.\u2019\"\nOur ruling\nCiting a study by University of Utah researchers, Sessions claimed that a legal settlement over police conduct between the ACLU and the city \"resulted in approximately 236 additional victims killed and over 1,100 additional shootings in 2016 alone.\"\nSessions misstated the ACLU\u2019s involvement with the Chicago police department \u2014 there was no lawsuit. He did, however, correctly recite conclusions of the study.\nThe overriding question, then, is whether the study reaches sound conclusions. On that, there is considerable disagreement. Chicago police stops did indeed dramatically plunge in the wake of a city agreement with the ACLU to overhaul its stop-and-frisk policy. A big jump in the city\u2019s murder rate also coincided with the end of policy\u2019s end. Even so, New York and other big cities did not experience hikes in violence and murders after curtailing stop-and-frisk.\nOther academics express serious reservations about the research methods used by the Utah study. The skeptics also point to an array of factors that may also have contributed to the murder and violence spike \u2014 not the least of which was the wrenching impact of the Laquan McDonald shooting video.\nThere is considerable debate about that.\nThere is some element of truth in the statement made by Sessions, but it also ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.
