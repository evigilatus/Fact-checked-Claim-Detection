Therefore, the Acting Chief of Staff of the White House (Mick Mulvani) was ready when he opened a press conference on October 17 by talking about the Group of Seven annual summit. It had just been announced that the President had decided to bring together the G-7 leaders of the world in June 2020, which would be held in the National Tramp Dural, a golf resort in 643 rooms outside Miami. \"Again, expect your questions, how is this not a violation of the rewards, would the president benefit from this?\" Molvani said. \"I believe that the President has made it very clear since he arrived here that he does not benefit from being here, and he has no interest in profit from being here; this is one of the reasons why he has not received a salary since he was here, and he has given it to charity, which will not be profitable here.\" At the very least, Tramp can expect to benefit from the future business that will be generated in Dural as a result of hosting a three-day exclusive summit that will receive global media coverage. Since Tramp took office, several foreign countries, including Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the Philippines, have hosted national Christmas celebrations at the Trump International Hotel in Washington. We found that the Saudi Government spent $270,000 at the hotel between October 2016, the month before Trump was elected, and March 2017 alone. More than 100 trips by Trump as head of property owned by him, such as Dural, the Mar Lago Club in Palm Beach, Fella, and the resorts in Los Angeles and Scotland, have brought to these companies revenues of at least $1.6 million, but perhaps much more, as reported in the Washington Post in June 2019. Income comes from federal officials and others who pay to stay where Trump remains. The White House and Trump campaign did not respond to our request for information to support Mulvani &apos; s claim that Trump would not benefit from the G-7 summit. But Molvani explained his claim during the press conference. \"Doral does this at cost,\" said Mulvani. \"As a result, it's actually much cheaper for us to do it in Dural than the other final sites we had.\" When asked by a journalist that the summit was a \"opportunity\" for Dural, Mulvani underestimated the idea by observing the visits by Trump as head of the Trump resorts. Molvani said, \"Maybe Donald Trump's brand is as strong as it is and you don't need any more help.\" \"It's the most popular name in English and probably all over the world now. So this has nothing to do with Doral's choice of top. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 On January 11, 2012, the chance to win Trump declined from day-to-day control of his business, but he remains a owner. Despite Mulvani &apos; s statement about the Trump brand, work in Dural has ceased. The profits declined by 69% in three years, although Dural still provides Trump with more income than any other hotel or golf club, according to the Post. The G-7 event is different from any other event and is held in the United States only every eight years. The Summit, to discuss a wide range of issues, rotates among the sites chosen by the seven member countries, as well as the European Union. Seven foreign leaders will be withdrawn from France, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany and Canada, along with Trump. Furthermore, hundreds of diplomats, journalists and security personnel will be attracted to Dural during one of the slower months of the year for the resort - and will attract global attention. Even if the event is organized in such a way that Dural will only break the booking of rooms, this does not take into account other spending by guests while in the real estate. Stephen Schunner, Professor of Government Procurement Law at George Washington University, said: \"The summer resort - the non-seasonal season in Florida - is put down even if it's 'at a cost, 'he reduces public expenses and contributes to the company's minimum.\" \"But, much more importantly, to think of this as propaganda or promotion of investment at no cost. Having a resort that fills television screens and newspaper pages with pictures of world leaders is a kind of publicity that it's almost impossible to put a price on.\" The publicity surrounding such an event was \"incredibly valued for the owner of the resort,\" and David Burns, co-founder and honorary president of the International Association of Hospitality Consultants and Veterans in the Hotel Industry, said for 53 years. \"Trap will not only benefit from advertising in the form of future reservation,\" said Burns, \"but you can be sure that the resort will be chock-a block with highly paid journalists, photographers, television crew and others who are paid separate bills for the event bill not only during the summit but for several days before and after.\" \"What do you mean, \"at cost\"? Burns added. \"Would there be a payroll allocation for accountants, green savers, plumbers and painters, electricity and water, or would that mean the direct costs of the meeting itself, such as rental of tents, food and beverages, and audio-visual equipment? Would you include painting costs, replacing carpets, making everything look new and bright?\" Our governor Molvani said \"Trump will not benefit\" from the G-7 summit meeting at the Trump Doral resort. The Acting White House Chief of Staff says the Miami area resort will host the gathering \"at cost.\" But the White House didn't explain how it would work. Furthermore, the Summit is a one-type event, attracting seven world leaders, hundreds of diplomats, journalists and other guests, and global publicity. Even at a cost, it fills the hotel during the slow Florida season, and the guests would have spent other amounts on the property even if the rooms were rented at equivalent prices. Mulvani's statement is inaccurate. We value this allegation wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00042"}
