But then he sat next to Putin at the dinner later that day with only a Russian translator present and no other American officials. (Trump told the New York Times they \"talked about Russian adoption.\")\nBut Richard Nixon was also known to hold meetings with foreign dignitaries without an American interpreter, Bremmer said.\n\"Apparently, President Nixon used to do it because he felt, didn't really trust the State Department, at that point, providing the translators and didn't want information getting out, leaking, that he would want to keep private,\" he said.\nWe attempted to contact Bremmer through his Eurasia Group communications director but didn\u2019t get a response.\nBut he doesn\u2019t appear to be losing much of anything in translation here. It turns out that on a couple of occasions, Nixon did meet with officials solo, although the circumstances were a bit different than Trump\u2019s meeting with Putin.\nInterpreting Nixon\u2019s meetings\nSeveral presidential historians told us that when American presidents meet with foreign heads of state or other officials, there is usually an aide or administration official attending with him. There also is usually an American interpreter present, so that the president may check how the discussion is being translated.\n\"When a president talks business he wants an aide there from his side to take notes,\" said Nick Cullather, a history professor at Indiana University. \"In diplomacy, if there are no notes, nothing happened.\"\nNixon did have a strained relationship with the State Department, and noted repeatedly in his memoir RN: The Memories of Richard Nixon that then-National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger, especially, did not get along with then-Secretary of State William Rogers.\nThere are anecdotes that Nixon would keep State Department interpreters out of meetings for fear of leaks, but he rarely attended meetings without some other American official present.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Texas history professor Jeremi Suri said the aide present was often Kissinger, as was the case when Nixon met with Chinese Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai on Feb. 21, 1972, without an American translator. There was a National Security Council notetaker there, and an official transcript was filed.\n\"This violated all diplomatic protocol because it meant Nixon could not check the interpretation of his words,\" Suri said.\nPrussian-born Harry Obst, who interpreted meetings for seven presidents including Nixon, recounted in his own book White House Interpreter that he had been barred from translating some meetings with German-speaking officials. One example Obst gave was at the behest of Kissinger, who was born in Germany and could understand German.\nBut the most comparable instances were when Nixon met with Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev.\nNixon relied on the Russian translator Viktor Sukhodrev, who worked for the Soviets, during one meeting at a summit between the two leaders in Moscow on May 22, 1972. The meeting was recorded and Sukhodrev took notes, according to State Department footnotes.\n\"There had been concern expressed that I should have a State Department translator present also,\" Nixon wrote in his memoir. \"But I knew that Sukhodrev was a superb linguist who spoke English as well as he did Russian, and I felt that Brezhnev would speak more freely if only one other person was present.\"\nThe situation was repeated when Brezhnev visited Washington a year later. Sukhodrev was the only interpreter for an Oval Office discussion between Nixon and Brezhnev on June 18, 1973. State Department footnotes said this meeting also was recorded.\nBoth conversations took place during official visits, and administration staff was aware of the meetings. The biggest difference between Nixon\u2019s discussions and Trump\u2019s, however, is that a record of what the leaders talked about exists in State Department records.\nBremmer had noted the lack of an official account of Trump\u2019s second G20 meeting with Putin during his MSNBC appearance.\n\"They (Trump and Putin) were out of earshot, so, I mean, unless the Russian translator has a tape \u2014 and I think there\u2019s a reasonable likelihood that he does \u2014 then, you know, nobody else is going to have a readout of this meeting,\" Bremmer said.\nOur ruling\nBremmer said, \"Apparently, President Nixon used to do it (hold meetings with heads of state without an American interpreter) because he felt, didn't really trust the State Department, at that point, providing the translators and didn't want information getting out, leaking, that he would want to keep private.\"\nPresidential historians, historical accounts and Nixon\u2019s own memoir show this was the case. But it\u2019s notable that even in the example most comparable to Trump\u2019s meeting with Putin, when Nixon used only a Soviet translator during two meetings with Brezhnev, official records of the meeting exist.\nWe rate Bremmer\u2019s statement True.\n Share the Facts 2017-07-21 15:56:43 UTC   PolitiFact    6 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: True  Says President Richard Nixon held meetings with heads of state without an American interpreter.
