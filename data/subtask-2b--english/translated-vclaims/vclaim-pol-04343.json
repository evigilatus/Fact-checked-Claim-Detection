Double it. Trump told the supporters at the September 6th rally in Virginia Beach. Did Obama double the national debt? We checked. The Trump Press Office justified its statement by sending us a link to the United States Department of the Treasury figures on the size of the national debt. On January 20, 2009, the day Obama took power, the national debt totalled $10.6 trillion. On September 6, the day Trump made his statement, it was $19.5 trillion. Over the past year, debt has grown by more than $1 trillion, so Trump's estimate that debt will be \"near $20 trillion\" by the time Obama's term ends in January is reasonable and close to doubling the amount from the date on which the President took office. These debt figures take into account all commitments, including some $5.4 trillion in intergovernmental debt owed by the United States Government to itself, such as the social security and medical trust funds invested in treasury bonds. In looking at the size of US debt, some experts prefer to calculate the amount of debt held by the public in treasury bonds, savings bonds and commitments to foreign governments, as this is the debt owed by the Government to external entities. However, even with this measure, debt has risen sharply. This month &apos; s public debt is $14.1 trillion, more than double the total of $6.3 trillion when Obama took office. On January 9, 2021, on Twitter, Sarah Goodlowski stated: \"Not all women lost jobs (in December's job report), most of them black and Latin women. But Trump's statement implies that Obama is solely responsible for the rise in religion, and this ignores a major part of the story. While Obama proposes to spend and sign it into law, all draft spending law must pass Congress first. In other words, the rise in debt is not an individual act of Obama. Other factors beyond the actions of elected officials contributed to the increase in debt. Robert Bixby, CEO of the Central Concord Alliance, told our colleagues in Politi Vakt Wisconsin in July that, given the fact that Obama took office while the Great Recession was draining government revenues, the debt \"was certainly going to explode during Obama's first term, regardless of who the president was.\" The governor, Trump, said Obama, \"Double the national debt.\" Double it. It'll be close to $20 trillion when he leaves.\" The figures are correct, and we have no doubt that the President shares some blame for the increase in indebtedness. The Trump statement, however, omits some key points. First of all, the additional debt was not only Obama's responsibility; Congress had to approve it as well. The recession that began before Obama took office in 2009 reduced government revenue and led to an increase in Obama &apos; s debt during the President &apos; s term of office. We're assessing Trump's claim of half the integrity.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04343"}
