At the White House News Conference, the President said that he was issuing the document in order to move from the so-called \"birth\" issue: \"We have to make a series of very difficult decisions about how to invest in our future but also to gain control over deficits and debt. But we won't be able to do it if we're distracted. We wouldn't be able to do that if we made things up and pretended that the facts weren't facts.\" However, Obama said, there is likely to be a \"part of the people\" who are insufficient evidence of his birth certificate. In fact, shortly after Obama's talk, Liu Berman, President of the Council of State, said that he was still not convinced that Obama was born in Honolulu Hospital, according to Texas Tribune. Tripion stated that, \"It is alleged that the Obama hospital list in his birth certificate - in fact, all hospitals in Honolulu - denied that the president was born there.\" We followed up with Berman, who told us that two hospitals, including the Cabiolani Medical Center for Women and Children, where Obama says he was born, denied it. He could not remember the name of the other hospital. We asked Berman where and when hospitals denied, and he said, \"In several places over the past year and a half,\" but he didn't give any more details. \"No hospital admitted the fact that he was born there and not just that, but you thought that the hospital that gave birth to the President of the United States would have some kind of commemorative painting or something.\" Berman also said, \"He's gonna take someone with a lot of money like Donald Trump to take a look at this and see if Capulani's gonna confess whether or not he was born there.\" Trump, a potential presidential candidate from the World Democratic Party, has repeatedly pointed out that Obama was not born in the United States. Earlier this month, for example, he said that \"the grandmother of Obama in Kenya said that he was born in Kenya and that she was there and watched his birth.\" \"Bolivi Fruitte\" has mistakenly evaluated this statement. In response to a 2008 question about whether she was \"present when he was born in Kenya,\" Obama's grandmother, speaking Swahili, initially said through an interpreter that she was present. She then clearly and repeatedly corrected herself, saying that he was born in the United States. In his interview on January 31, 2021, John Kerry said that Hurricane Harvey \"dropped water in Houston in five days more than Niagara Falls in one year.\" At least five other allegations concerning Obama &apos; s birthplace were examined by Polyte Fruitte, and none of them were found to be true. The first was a claim in February by Berman, who said the Governor of Hawaii \"nothing can be found that Obama was born in Hawaii. We found no evidence that the Governor said so, and we assessed his claim wrong. We have searched the Lexi-Nixes database, which keeps news articles, and the Internet, where doubts about Obama's proof of citizenship flourish because of assurances that Capulani's hospital has ever denied being the birth site of Obama. There were no confirmed cases of hospital officials. However, we found the 18 January story of WorldNet Daily, a conservative journalist's site that raised controversy about the birth certificate, and reported that the former Honolulu election official said that Capulani Hospital had no record that Obama was born there. Two days later, Hollywood's reporter Mike Evans claims to be a long-time friend of Huay Goff. Neil Abercrombie told KQRS-FM radio in Minnesota that the Governor told him that he had searched \"everywhere he used his powers as governor\" at Capulani and Quinn hospitals and that \"Barack Obama's birth certificate was not available in Hawaii. There is certainly no evidence that he was born in Hawaii.\" In any case, Fox News.com later quoted Evans as saying he had misspoken. He said, \"I haven't spoken to Neil since he became governor.\" According to Fox, Evans said that he had contacted the Abu Krombe office after reading online reports that the Governor had not been able to find Obama &apos; s birth certificate but that Apocrumbi had not responded to his call. The recently issued Obama birth certificate contradicts those reports - and Berman's claim. According to the document, Barack Hussein Obama II was born at the Kabiolani Maternity and Gynaecology Hospital at 7:24 p.m. on 4 August 1961. We tried to contact officials from the Cabiolani Women &apos; s and Children &apos; s Medical Center on Wednesday and did not respond to them. However, as Factcheck.org stated on April 9, see Tramp's allegations, Capulani is legally unable to publish individually identifiable health information, which is prohibited by the Health Insurance Transfer and Accountability Act 1996. According to the United States Department of Health and Human Services, health information that can be determined on an individual basis is information relating to the provision of health care to the individual, or anything that can reasonably be used to identify the individual, such as name, address, date of birth or social security number. Health information can only be shared in certain circumstances, depending on the location, such as reporting a gunshot wound to the police. The protected information includes the information contained in the individual's medical record, and health service providers must comply with the right of the individual to decide whether health information can be shared for specific purposes. In July 2009, World Net Daily quoted Christy Watanabe, spokesman for the Hawaii Pacific Health Foundation, which includes Capiolani Hospital, as saying: \"Our comment on everyone who relates is that federal law does not allow us to provide any further details of the information concerning Obama's birth without Mr.'s permission. Obama. However, the Medical Centre promoted a letter written by Obama in January 2009 on the White House stationery to congratulate the Medical Centre on its centennial celebration. The letter states: \"Cabiolani was one of the first Hawaii hospitals, and has served many generations of Hawaiians with distinction.\" \"As a beneficiary of the Cabiolani Medical Center - where I was born - I am pleased to add my voice to the chorus of your supporters.\" The Pacific Health Foundation in Hawaii published the message in its Inspire spring issue, and the Medical Center published a video of Abebercromby reading Obama's message at the centennial dinner on its website. With regard to the recent CNN investigation into \"birth\" allegations, which was broadcast on 25-26 April, CNN's reporter, Gary Toshman, travelled to Hawaii for several interviews, including with Monica Danielson, who said that she was at the hospital at the same time with Obama's mother and saw him in foster care. He also interviewed Chiomi Fukino, who was the Director of the State Ministry of Health under the administration of the Government of the Republic. (Linda Lingle) In sum, according to Toshman: his research \"discovers what most analysts have said since the \"birth\" debate broke out during the 2008 presidential campaign: Obama was born in Hawaii on 4 August 1961. A period.\" As far as we know, Capulani has not confirmed that Obama was born there, citing the Federal Privacy Act, which prevents him from doing so. But we didn't find any record that the hospital denied it, as Perman claims. Neither did the legislator provide evidence of this. We have an estimate for such data.
