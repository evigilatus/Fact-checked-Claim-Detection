Here\u2019s the list, which ranks the states based on a per-capita measurement, so that larger-population states don\u2019t dominate the rankings:\n\n\n\n\nRank\n\n\nState\n\n\n\n\n1.\n\n\nWest Virginia\n\n\n\n\n2.\n\n\nWashington, D.C.\n\n\n\n\n3.\n\n\nMinnesota\n\n\n\n\n4.\n\n\nUtah\n\n\n\n\n5.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

In 2017 and 2016, it ranked third, and in 2015, it ranked fifth.\nSo why does West Virginia rank so high? History, said Dana Bryant, a spokeswoman for Volunteer West Virginia, the state's commission for national and community service.\nNational service programs like AmeriCorps \"have a long history in West Virginia, from the Civilian Conservation Corps of the 1930s to southern coalfield (Volunteers in Service to America) fighting poverty in the 1960s to the creation of AmeriCorps in 1993,\" she said. In West Virginia, \"volunteering is just a way of life,\" she said.\nWest Virginia also received benefits from AmeriCorps. In 2017, the agency said, more than 3,800 people undertook national service in 600 locations across West Virginia and $12.2 million was invested, including \"reducing crime and reviving cities, connecting veterans to services, fighting the opioid epidemic, helping seniors live independently, and rebuilding communities after disasters.\"\nOur ruling\nManchin tweeted, \"This year West Virginia produced more AmeriCorps members than any other state.\"\nAmeriCorps data confirms West Virginia\u2019s first-place rating per capita for 2018, the first time the state ranked first since the agency began publishing the data in 2015.\nWe rate the statement True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01674"}
