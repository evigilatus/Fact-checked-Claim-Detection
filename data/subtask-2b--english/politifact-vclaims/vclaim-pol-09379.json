Measure 26-152 would raise approximately $10 million a year from an increase in property taxes, half of which would go toward restoration of natural areas. \n\n\nMetro officials say the measure is necessary because general obligation bond measures approved by voters in 1995 and in 2006 allowed the government to purchase land, but didn\u2019t provide money to restore and maintain the new land. \n\n\n\"Twice in two decades, Metro voters approved measures to acquire thousands of acres of natural areas throughout the tri-county region,\" reads the Voters\u2019 Pamphlet summary of this spring\u2019s Measure 26-152. \"Past measures could not include money for maintenance and restoration.\" \n\n\nWhich got PolitiFact Oregon thinking. We remembered how the 2006 measure was pitched to voters. The language of Measure 26-80, also in the Voters\u2019 Pamphlet, was clear: \"This measure directs Metro to buy and restore natural areas for the protection of water quality and preservation of fish and wildlife habitat ...\" \n\n\nMetro officials wrote both statements in the Voters\u2019 Pamphlet. Voters overwhelmingly approved the $227 million bond measure in 2006, probably thinking that the money would go toward both purchase and actual restoration, because that\u2019s what supporters said they\u2019d do. \n\n\nDid Metro use the promise of restoration to sell the 2006 measure? Why is it now saying that the 2006 money couldn\u2019t be used for restoration? Has Metro flip-flopped on what the 2006 bond could and could not do? \n\n\nWe shot off an email to Metro spokesman Jim Middaugh and started digging. For people who don\u2019t follow the scintillating world of public finance, just know that government can sell general obligation bonds -- and take on debt -- to pay for capital projects and improvements. Governments do it all the time. \n\n\nGovernments do not, however, tend to incur long-term debt for operational expenses, such as routine maintenance or payroll. That\u2019s poor fiscal policy, and that is the distinction Metro is making with the different measures. \n\n\nSo the first question for us is: Can money from bonds be used for restoration, despite what Metro now says? This description of general obligation debt -- found on the state Treasury website -- indicates that the answer is yes. \n\n\n\"Under ORS 287A.050 - 287A.145 general obligation debt can be incurred for capital construction and improvements having an expected useful life of more than one year. This does not include maintenance and repair (the need for which could be reasonably anticipated), supplies, and equipment that are not intrinsic to a structure.\" \n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolitiFact Oregon can see how restoration of purchased property could count as an improvement lasting for more than year. And certainly, Metro officials saw it that way because they sold it that way. \n\n\nStill, Metro draws a distinction between restoration spending then and restoration spending now. Middaugh said that despite the state description, the agency has its own guidelines on how to spend bonded money. \n\n\nFor example, Metro used bonded money for the initial \"stabilization\" part of restoration, defined as \"one-time activities performed during the first two to five years after\" land purchase. Mowing grass, killing weeds and removing trash is OK so long as the activities take place during this phase -- but afterward, those actions are considered maintenance. \n\n\nWhy wasn\u2019t this distinction called out in public materials? The description was too wonky, he said, so they went with the more conversational \"restoration\" and \"protection.\" \n\n\nHalf of the money from this operating levy would go toward operations and education, and the other half to continued restoration of natural areas. Out of curiosity, we asked if Metro had planned all along to come back to voters for more money. The answer was yes, and the proof is on page 9 of the resolution authorizing the 2006 measure, stating that Metro would only have enough money to manage new lands for a limited time.\n\n\nAll we can say to these disclosures is that we wish Metro had been utterly transparent and upfront -- both about long-term funding plans and definitions -- with voters from the beginning.\n\n\nPolitiFact Oregon loves nature and we love good governance. We don\u2019t want public bodies borrowing money recklessly, and we trust our elected officials to make that distinction. \n\n\nBut here we have a government that sold an earlier measure as a way to buy and restore natural areas and that now says officials couldn\u2019t use that money for restoration. Yet there is no legal prohibition on using bond proceeds for restoration. In fact, Metro has spent nearly $5 million to do so, even if staffers call it something else. \n\n\nThe bottom line is that both statements come from the Voters' Pamphlet and both were written by Metro officials. And both statements can\u2019t be right. \n\n\nMetro wants more money to further nurture its new natural areas. Metro wants money for boat ramps and better playgrounds that should improve use of visitor areas. We don\u2019t fault the wishes. But we do fault Metro for saying one thing, then another, about whether restoration was part of the plan in 2006 and why more money is needed in 2013. \n\n\nThis is a reversal of position by Oregon\u2019s tri-county regional government.
