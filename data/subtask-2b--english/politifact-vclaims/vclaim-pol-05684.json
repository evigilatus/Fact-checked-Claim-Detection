But questions about cost overruns continue to dog the California High-Speed Rail Authority. A consultant\u2019s draft report was recently made public and indicated the system\u2019s Merced-to-Burbank stretch could cost $8 billion more than expected.\nRail authority officials said the report was preliminary, and hasn\u2019t increased the current budget.\nIn recent weeks, Jeff Morales, the rail authority\u2019s chief executive officer, and other authority leaders, have tried to change the narrative about mounting costs. They\u2019ve started to say that expenses are, in fact, trending down.\n\"The actual (construction) contracts that we\u2019ve awarded to date have come in several hundred million dollars below estimates. That\u2019s the reality of where we are in the program,\" Morales said during a press conference in Madera in late October, captured in the video clip below.\n\nKSEE TV Fresno, Nov. 1, 2015\nSeveral hundred million dollars is miniscule compared with the project\u2019s overall cost. But because the CEO\u2019s statement goes against the project\u2019s past financial history, it inspired us to check the facts.\nChecking Morales\u2019 claim\nRail authority officials clarified that Morales was referring to the project\u2019s first two major construction contracts.\nWe dug out those documents for a look. The first is for a 29-mile stretch of track from Madera to Fresno, including a tunnel and several raised crossings, one over the San Joaquin River. The authority\u2019s lowest cost estimate was $1.2 billion. The winning bid was significantly less, at about $1 billion.\nThe authority\u2019s second major project is a 60-mile leg from Fresno south to the Tulare-Kern County line. It projected the price as low as $1.5 billion. The winning bid was a slightly more than $1.2 billion. Doing the math, the bids were a combined $480 million less than the lowest estimates. That qualifies as \"several hundred million dollars.\"\nMorales, the rail authority executive, doesn\u2019t call this a \u2018savings\u2019 in his statement. He says only that bids came in below estimates, which the authority set for itself.\nOn the right track?\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin Nunes\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in an interview on Fox\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRepublicans have no way to communicate\u201d after tech companies cut off Parler.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Amy Sherman \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese bids are significantly less than estimated. But is that the end of the story? And does this mean the rail authority will see a cost savings?\nNot likely, said Jan Whittington, a professor at the University of Washington who studies the financing of large-scale infrastructure projects across the globe.\nThat\u2019s because there are always unforeseen consequences. Crews could hit harder rock than anticipated, find an endangered species along the route or encounter unstable soil, all adding to the time and cost of the project.\n\"There\u2019s always going to be something that either the project manager or the contractors themselves did not foresee in design that they encounter during construction,\" Whittington said. \"It\u2019s nice to hear that they received bids that were lower than anticipated. But you don\u2019t know how much it costs until they finish constructing it and it\u2019s begun operating.\"\nStill in the hole\nSteve Boilard, who heads Sacramento State University\u2019s Center for California Studies, said any implication that lower construction bids lead to actual savings is wrong. He said these lower bids do little to remove the bullet train\u2019s overall financial uncertainty. The authority lacks funds for the bulk of the project, which would link the Los Angeles and San Francisco metro areas.\n\"With an overall cost of $68 billion, it just means that the hole that we\u2019re in and having to find money, maybe is going to be a little bit less as a result of these lower bids,\" Boilard said.\nMorales isn\u2019t the only rail authority leader to tout the low bids. Dan Richard, the authority\u2019s chairman, recently told Capital Public Radio that that \"costs are coming down\" for much of the system, in part, due to the bids. In a follow up interview, Richard explained that the authority is using design-build agreements that shift some cost overruns to the construction contractor. He said, however, there is no way for the authority to completely avoid unexpected, added expenses.\nOur ruling\nJeff Morales, the rail authority\u2019s chief executive officer, said in late October: \"The actual (construction) contracts that we\u2019ve awarded to date have come in several hundred million dollars below estimates.\"\nAfter digging out the original documents, the winning bids are a combined $480 million below the authority\u2019s cost estimates. That works out to \"several hundred\" million.\nStill, the lower bids do nothing to wipe away the overall project\u2019s financial uncertainty, several experts said. Its\u00a0funding gap remains\u00a0in the tens of billions of dollars.\nThe implication behind Morales\u2019 statement about the bids is that the authority is either controlling its costs or could potentially save money. Officials probably wouldn\u2019t talk about the bids otherwise. Even the authority\u2019s chairman said there\u2019s no way to safeguard against all possible higher expenses.\nThe phrase \"to date\" in the CEO\u2019s carefully worded comment may be the most critical going forward. Every independent expert we spoke with suggested future cost overruns are likely for the project.\nEven so, our fact checks evaluate the here and now, and not predictions.\nWe rate the claim Mostly True.\n\nMOSTLY TRUE\u00a0\u2013\u00a0The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05684"}
