Trump is actually holding a proclamation he signed on May 7, 2018, during an event in the Rose Garden for Melania Trump\u2019s \"Be Best\" initiative. You can see many Associated Press photos from that day here and here.\nIn April, Snopes fact-checked a similar Facebook post that appeared to show Trump holding a T-shirt that said, \"No matter who is president Jesus is still king.\" That one was also doctored. The original image shows the president holding a jersey with his name and the number \"45\" on the back, according to Snopes.\nWe rate this Facebook post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00205"}
