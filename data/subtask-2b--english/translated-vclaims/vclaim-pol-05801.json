Donald Trump faced a co-director at CBC Becky Quick on something Trump supposedly said about a presidential competitor, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. Here's the exchange: Quickly: \"You've talked a little bit about Marco Rubio. I believe you called him the Founder of Facebook, Personal Senator Mark Zuckerberg, because he was in favour of the H-1B visa.\" Trump: \"I never said that. \"I never said that.\" Quickly: \"So this is the wrong article all the way? My apologies, I'm sorry.\" Trump: \"Someone's really doing some nasty fact check.\" As it turns out, he was too quick to apologize. We looked at the immigration policy page of the Trump campaign website and found the following: the distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" By Samantha Buterman: January 11, 2021 \"Here are some additional specific policy proposals for long-term reform: \"The increase in the prevailing wages of H-1Bs. We graduate from the United States with stim certificates twice a year more than finding six-M jobs, yet up to two thirds of the entry level for IT jobs is accomplished through H-1B. More than half of the H-1B visas are issued for the lowest level of remuneration allowed in the programme, and more than 80 per cent for the lowest two. Increasing the prevailing wages paid to H-1Bs will force companies to give these jobs at the desired level of incomes to the current local pool of local workers and unemployed immigrants in the United States, rather than flying in cheaper workers from abroad. This would improve the number of black and Spanish workers and women in Silicon Valley who have been passed on to H-1B. Personal Senator Mark Zuckerberg, Marco Rubio, has a three-fold H-1B bill that would eliminate women and minorities. And here's a shot we took during the discussion: a quick circle came back later in the discussion, indicating that it got its information from Trump's website. Trump didn't file an appeal. We did not receive an immediate response from Camp Trump. In our debate, Trump said, \"He never said that\" Marco Rubio was personal senator Mark Zuckerberg. But he might want to check his own location, which he says exactly. Pants on fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05801"}
