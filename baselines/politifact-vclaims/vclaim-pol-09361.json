Sanders touted", "text": "Georgia sometimes gets a bad rap for the amount of money the state invests in education and spends on students. \n\n\nJust last month, for example, a study by a national education organization said Georgia fell six spots to 25th out of 40 states in spending on its pre-kindergarten program over two school years since 2010 due to budget cuts. \n\n\nBut the education funding battles of recent budget years were different 50 years ago. In a recent Atlanta Journal-Constitution article about the 1963 Georgia Legislature, former Gov. Zell Miller recalled the strides made in education by then-Gov. Carl Sanders. \n\n\nMiller lauded Sanders for putting 56 percent of the state budget into education -- a figure, Miller said, that has not been achieved since.\n\n\nThat percentage seemed rather large, even for the largest portion of state government. PolitiFact Georgia wondered if Miller, who later became a U.S. senator, was correct.\n\n\nMiller, a North Georgia Democrat and longtime politician, called the 1963 legislative session \"the birth of modern Georgia.\" That was the year that the courts ordered that Senate districts be reapportioned to reflect populations, which meant more power for Georgia\u2019s cities and minorities. That 1963 session saw the first African-American senator (Leroy R. Johnson), and the installment of Sanders as governor.\n\n\nSanders, also a Democrat, became governor at age 37, the youngest in the nation at the time, after running on a platform of a new, modern Georgia. He\u2019s known as Georgia\u2019s first New South governor, and the first modern governor elected by popular vote. He served one term, from 1963 to 1967; ran unsuccessfully for the post in 1970 against Jimmy Carter, then left politics to practice law. \n\n\nIn the book \"Carl Sanders: Spokesman of the New South,\" author and historian James F. Cook repeats a similar statistic about Sanders\u2019 education investment: \"... he (Sanders) made education his first priority and directed nearly sixty cents of every tax dollar into education.\" \n\n\nThe book passage says that under Sanders\u2019 leadership, 10,000 new teachers were added to Georgia\u2019s schools, and more schools and classrooms were built than under any previous administration. The Governor\u2019s Honors program and the junior college network were started, four junior colleges were elevated to four-year status and a new dental school was established.\n\n\nAs for funding, $176.5 million was appropriated for University System construction, and average faculty salaries increased 32.5 percent, moving Georgia from 10th to fourth place among Southern states. \n\n\n\"I knew that the more people we could educate in Georgia, the better off the state would be in every capacity, politic wise, business wise, otherwise,\" Sanders said in a 2007 Georgia Public Broadcasting interview.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe kicker, according to Cook\u2019s book: Despite Sanders\u2019 extensive education spending, the former governor left $140 million in the treasury -- the largest amount ever left to a succeeding governor up to that time.\n\n\nIn addition to the historical accounts of Sanders\u2019 spending, we also checked with the state Education Department and state budget office for more help.\n\n\nFinancial reports of all school systems kept by the Georgia Department of Education were available from 1996 to 2012. Those records showed that one year, 1998, the education portion of the state\u2019s budget exceeded Sanders\u2019 56 percent, by 2 percentage points. For the available reporting years, the data showed four years -- 1996, 1997, 1999 and 2001 -- where the education allocation tied Sanders\u2019 56 percent figure. \n\n\nIt must be noted that some of the budgets in the Education Department data included some state funding for Georgia schools that was not available during Sanders\u2019 tenure, such as lottery funds.\n\n\nData compiled and provided by the Governor\u2019s Office of Planning and Budget included information from Sanders\u2019 first year in office, 1963, through fiscal year 2014. The data substantiated Miller\u2019s claim about Sanders\u2019 education allocation reaching 56 percent of the budget, but also showed that the allocation reached 58 percent for schools during his third year in office, 1965. \n\n\nThe budget office data also showed the education portion of the state budget either equaled or exceeded the 56 percent allocation from 1964 through 1970, and from 2009 to 2011. Agency officials noted that the data included lottery and tobacco settlement funds. Those dollars weren\u2019t available to Sanders. Also of note, the amounts from 1963 to 1974 -- which covered Sanders\u2019 term -- included money for capital projects, like buying land and building facilities.\n\n\nHow was Sanders able to accomplish his education goals?\n\n\n\"I had the budget power to put together a package of bills to accomplish what I wanted to accomplish because the (House and Senate) didn\u2019t have their own budget officers,\" Sanders, 87, told PolitiFact Georgia in an interview from his law office. \"I didn\u2019t realize I would be the last governor with that power.\"\n\n\nSo does Miller\u2019s claim get fully funded?\n\n\nHe said former Gov. Carl Sanders allocated 56 percent of the state budget to education, a level that has not since been achieved. Historical accounts and actual state education and budget data confirmed Sanders\u2019 allocation levels. The data also showed a few years since Sanders when the levels have reached that amount, but those years included funding, such as lottery and tobacco settlement dollars, that were not available to Sanders.\n\n\nOverall, it is important to note that over the past 50 years, methods for funding education in the state, the available revenue streams and the definition of what constitutes education have changed numerous times. Still, data showed that education has always accounted for more than half of the budget in each of those years. \n\n\nWe rate Miller\u2019s claim Mostly True.\n\n\nStaff intern Karishma Mehrotra contributed to this article.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09361"}
