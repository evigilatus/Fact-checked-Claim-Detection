(Scott Walker) He continued: \"But 100 times -- listen to this -- 100 times a lot of people worked their way from poverty to the American middle class. This is how this economy must work.\" Clinton filed the same claim a month ago on CNN. A hundred times the number? Now, this is statistical begging to be verified. In November 1992, Clinton, a democracy, was elected for two terms, from January 1993 to January 2001. Reagan, a Republican, was elected in November 1980 and worked for eight years, from January 1981 to January 1989. The spokesman for Clinton cited census figures showing a net decrease of about 7.7 million people living in poverty from 1993 to 2000. This is 100 times higher than 77,000 times during the Reagan era from 1981 to 1988. But there are some cherry that cut the cherry in this comparison. Why? The President is elected in November but does not hold office until January. In order to be coherent, you must commit to one or the other. On January 9, 2021, on Twitter, Sarah Goodlowski stated: \"Not all women lost jobs (in December's job report), most of them black and Latin women. In fact, white women got a job. \"Bolivi Fruit National\" was mischaracterized. Our colleagues looked at two-to-eight-year frameworks: the years of elections, from 1992 to 2000 for Clinton and from 1980 to 1988 for Reagan; and the years in which men took office and left office - from 1993 to 2001 for Clinton and from 1981 to 1989 for Reagan. Our colleagues found similar trends for each time frame and then reported figures based on the second time frame. In the eight years that have passed under Clinton, the number of Americans living in poverty has fallen by 6.5 million - more than 22 times from 294,000 under Reagan. That's a lot, but it's not 100 times. Another problem relates to Clinton's allegations, since not only are there people no longer living in poverty, but those who have moved from poverty to the \"medium class.\" His spokesperson did not provide any evidence of how many people had moved to the middle class. Jonathan Schwabich, the economist and senior researcher at the Urban Institute, told us that there is no consensus on what constitutes the middle class. He also said that it would be difficult to argue that all the people who had emerged from poverty had entered the middle class. In fact, a person whose income exceeds one dollar above the poverty line will not officially live in poverty, but may not feel as if he had suddenly joined the middle class. Our assessment of Clinton says \"100 times the number of people who worked their way from poverty to the American middle class\" during his presidency compared to that of Reagan. In one way -- from the year in which each president took office to the election year in which each last president served -- the number of people who no longer lived in poverty under Clinton was 100 times higher than that under Reagan. But a constant measure -- from the year that each president took office to the year that each president left office -- shows that the figure under Clinton was only 22 times higher. Moreover, Clinton did not provide any evidence that all people recovered from poverty during his tenure entered the middle class. For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that give a different impression, our assessment is often wrong.
