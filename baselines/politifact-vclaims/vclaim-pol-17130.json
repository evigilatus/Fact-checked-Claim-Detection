California\u2019s grid operator called for utilities to initiate temporary blackouts on Friday and Saturday as the high demand for electricity outstripped supply. Additional blackouts are possible.\u00a0\nWe set out to fact check the president\u2019s questionable claim that politics was at play in deciding to call for the blackouts.\nCalifornia Power Grid Operator Rejects Trump\u2019s Claim\nThe state\u2019s power grid is managed by the California Independent System Operator, or CAISO. It is a nonprofit public benefit corporation. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom nominates members to the organization\u2019s board of governors.\u00a0\nBut the decision to call for blackouts was made by a shift manager at CAISO\u2019s control room, not by the board or the organization\u2019s CEO, officials said on Tuesday.\u00a0\n\"There wasn\u2019t any party affiliation or other kind of input into the decisions to shed load on Friday and Saturday night,\" Steve Berberich, the system operator\u2019s CEO, told the media, as reported by the San Francisco Chronicle.\u00a0\nOn Saturday evening, PG&E, which provides power to much of Northern and Central California, said 220,000 customers lost electricity. Outages were mostly in portions of the Central Coast and Central Valley, including Monterey, Santa Cruz and San Joaquin counties. Approximately the same number of customers lost power on Friday evening.\u00a0\nSeverin Borenstein, who sits on CAISO\u2019s board of governors, said calling for rolling blackouts is a last resort measure to avoid having \"the entire grid go down.\" Politics, he said, had nothing to do with it.\u00a0\n\"I don't understand what the political motivation would be to have rolling blackouts,\" Borenstein told PolitiFact California. \"If anything it seems that this just gives Trump an opening to rail against renewable energy.\u00a0 But in any case, there is no political link to the decision to implement rolling blackouts.\"\nIn his tweet on Tuesday, Trump not only charged Democrats in California for implementing the blackouts, he also alleged that \"Democrats are unable to keep up with energy demand \u2026 Meanwhile, I gave America energy independence in fact, so much energy we could never use it all. The Bernie/Biden/AOC Green New Deal plan would take California\u2019s failed policies to every American!\"\nWhy Was The Decision Made To Call For Blackouts In California?\u00a0\nOn Monday, CAISO officials blamed a combination of factors for the rolling blackouts: Several days of triple digit temperatures across California and much of the West, lower output from renewable energy sources and a gas-powered plant going offline unexpectedly.\u00a0\nBorenstein, who directs the Energy Institute at UC Berkeley\u2019s Haas School of Business, said CAISO warned the state\u2019s utility regulator in January that greater energy capacity was needed.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalifornia added large amounts of renewable energy through solar and wind in recent decades. But those options, particularly solar, haven\u2019t been enough to meet demand at night during this heat wave, Borenstein explained.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s because solar energy shuts off at night when many Californians are continuing to run air conditioning.\u00a0\n\"We have not built enough capacity,\" Borenstein said, adding that solar storage options are needed.\u00a0\nIn a letter sent Monday to three independent agencies that oversee the state\u2019s electrical grid and utility companies, Newsom said residents and officials did not receive proper warning of impending blackouts.\nThe governor called the sudden shut-offs \u2014 the first rolling blackouts since 2001, which, in part, led to the recall of then-Gov. Gray Davis \u2014 \"unacceptable and unbefitting of the nation\u2019s largest and most innovative state.\"\u00a0\nAt a press briefing later that day, Newsom took responsibility for the hasty blackouts, but made no suggestion that politics was at play in triggering them.\n\"We failed to predict and plan, and that\u2019s simply unacceptable,\" he said. \"I am the governor. I am ultimately accountable and will ultimately take responsibility to \u2026 ensure this simply never happens again in the state of California.\"\nOfficials on Tuesday urged Californians to continue to conserve electricity to avoid additional rolling blackouts.\u00a0\nOur rating\nPresident Trump claimed \"In California, Democrats have intentionally implemented rolling blackouts.\"\u00a0\nThe state is in the middle of a prolonged and scorching heat wave. Its power grid operator, California Independent System Operator, called for private utilities to initiate temporary blackouts on Friday and Saturday when electricity demand outpaced supply.\u00a0\nOfficials at CAISO said the motivation for the blackouts was to ensure California\u2019s power grid didn\u2019t collapse, and that politics was not a factor.\nOfficials said neither the CEO nor board members, who are appointed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, called for the blackouts. Instead, the decision was made by a power grid shift manager.\nIn the end, Trump offered no evidence to back up his provocative and questionable claim.\u00a0\nWe rated it False.\u00a0\nFALSE \u2013 The statement is not accurate.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17130"}
