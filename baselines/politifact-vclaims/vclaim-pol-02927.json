Bush issue actions similar to DACA, as Al Franken said?", "text": "Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., took to the airwaves to defend the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, policy the Obama administration put in place in 2012 after Congress failed to pass immigration legislation.\nDACA defers the deportation of certain illegal immigrants who initially entered the United States as children. President Trump has said he would rescind it and that former President Barack Obama exceeded his authority by signing it.\nNot so, Franken said.\n\"The executive order that President Obama gave on this was actually lawful,\" Franken said in a Sept. 5 interview on MSNBC. \"President Reagan did a similar thing. George H.W. Bush did a similar order.\"\nWe decided to look more closely at whether Reagan and the elder Bush took actions similar to DACA.\nWas Reagan\u2019s 1987 action similar to DACA?\nBecause Reagan and Bush are each credited with issuing multiple executive grants of immigration relief, we asked Franken\u2019s staff to clarify which Reagan and Bush actions the senator had in mind.\nFranken was referring to a 1987 action Reagan took on the heels of the Immigration Reform and Control Act. That sweeping 1986 immigration overhaul granted legal status for many, but not all, illegal immigrants.\nCrucially, the law did not automatically apply to the spouses or children of newly-legalized immigrants, which meant families across the country were vulnerable to being split based on differences in legal status.\nAfter Congress failed to pass a bill to reduce family disruptions, Reagan drew upon his executive authority to do so on his own. His 1987 executive action to legalize the status of minor children of parents granted amnesty under the immigration overhaul affected an estimated 100,000 families. (Note that spouses and children of couples where one parent, but not both, qualified for amnesty\u00a0were not included in Reagan's policy.)\nReagan\u2019s 1987 action parallels Obama\u2019s DACA in some key ways, but differs in others.\nBoth are examples of a president wielding his power not to apply U.S. immigration law in cases where he deems this necessary or appropriate, said David Shirk, a fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.\nUsing executive authority this way is not so unusual among modern presidents. As Kenneth R. Mayer, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told us in a previous fact-check, \"Presidents going back to at least Reagan have made unilateral adjustments to immigration law -- adding exemptions, extending protection to classes not covered by existing statutes such as children and spouses, making discretionary decisions about what constitutes \u2018unlawful presence\u2019 or what categories of people here illegally will be the focus of enforcement action.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn important distinction, however, is that while DACA provided a temporary reprieve from deportation, it\u00a0fell short of giving legal status to eligible immigrants, as Reagan\u2019s had done, Shirk said.\n\"(Obama\u2019s action) allowed undocumented immigrant children to come out of the shadows, but only as long as the executive branch adhered to the policy of DACA,\" he said. \"Reagan's order gave undocumented immigrant children full legal status, with the possibility of permanent residency and eventual consideration for citizenship.\"\nThe two policies also differ in terms of the number of people affected. Whereas Reagan\u2019s action affected an estimated 100,000 families, nearly 800,000 undocumented immigrants have taken advantage of DACA.\nAs we\u2019ve noted previously, critics have argued that Obama\u2019s action is different because he did it in the face of opposition from Congress (at least from the House), whereas Reagan\u2019s policy (and Bush\u2019s, for that matter) was undertaken to fix \"loose ends\" of the 1986 immigration law.\nWas George H.W. Bush\u2019s 1990 action similar to DACA?\nFranken\u2019s reference to the elder Bush concerned his 1990 executive action, which like Reagan\u2019s before him, sought to smooth off some of the rough edges of the immigration overhaul.\u00a0\nTo prevent families from being split up, Bush\u2019s policy effectively forestalled the deportation of spouses and children of\u00a0a person who gained legal status as a result of the 1986 law, a broader group than those affected by Reagan's action.\nLike DACA (and Reagan\u2019s 1987 action), Bush\u2019s action is another example of a president relying on executive authority to selectively apply U.S. immigration law so as not to deport certain undocumented immigrants.\nSimilar to DACA, Bush\u2019s action\u00a0did not confer legal status. Rather, it granted deportation deferment that could be renewed periodically. Both permitted affected immigrants to receive work permits.\nThere\u2019s disagreement over how many undocumented immigrants were covered by Bush\u2019s action. It was initially estimated to apply to up to 1.5 million, though Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors tighter immigration policies, has written that as few as 140,000 took advantage of it. So that\u2019s either substantially larger or substantially smaller than the nearly 800,000 DACA recipients.\nOur ruling\nFranken said, \"President Reagan did a similar thing. George H.W. Bush did a similar order\" as Obama\u2019s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA.\nThere are differences in the substance and circumstances of DACA, on the one hand, and the Reagan and Bush actions, on the other. But they are similar in their broad strokes and even share some specific features.\nMost significantly, all three are examples of presidents relying on executive authority to selectively apply U.S. immigration law to lift \u2014 or lift the risk of \u2014 deportation for large numbers of undocumented immigrants.\nWe rate this Mostly True.\n Share the Facts 2017-09-08 19:46:57 UTC   PolitiFact    5 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly True   \"President (Ronald) Reagan did a similar thing.
