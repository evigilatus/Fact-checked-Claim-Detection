We found that to be\n\nMostly True.\n\nAnd Clinton has said she supports letting the Bush tax cuts of 2001 expire as scheduled in 2010 for people making more than $250,000 a year. Critics point to that as a sign she plans to raise taxes as president.\n\n\nBut it's the \"there is nothing you can do\" line that draws the Truth-O-Meter's attention.\n\n\nSince when can a president raise taxes without the approval of Congress? And aren't voters encouraged to speak up about policies they oppose?\n\n\nWe gave a Pants on Fire ruling to former presidential candidate John Edwards when he claimed\n\nking-like powers\n\nfor the presidency. The RNC now makes a similar claim.\n\n\nMaybe the RNC should stick to the biting sarcasm of such sentiments as \"On this Valentine's Day ... may higher taxes come your way!\" (a Clinton card offering) or \"Will you be my Valentine? Yes ... no ... present\" (a shot at Obama's voting record in the Illinois state Senate).\n\n\nOr consider adding fact sheets with footnotes to its Valentines.
