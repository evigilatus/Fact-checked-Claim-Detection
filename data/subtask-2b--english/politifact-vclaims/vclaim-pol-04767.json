And the market took a pretty big hit from the British referendum, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping 3.4 percent and the S&P\u00a0500 index falling 3.6 percent.\nHowever, we couldn\u2019t find an ongoing daily log of the total value of Americans\u2019 401(k)s. The Investment Company Institute puts the figure at $4.8 trillion as of March 31, 2016.\nThe Clinton campaign explained to us how they calculated that $100 billion figure, and experts told us the reasoning was sound.\nBasically, the campaign took that March figure for the total value of all 401(k) accounts, $4.8 trillion, and calculated any growth through June 23, the day before the Brexit vote, and then the subsequent fall. They based the growth on changes in the U.S. stock market, as stocks account for about 66 percent of 401(k) assets, and fixed income, which accounts for 27 percent.\nTheir end result: An estimated drop of $110 billion in 401(k) assets from June 23 to June 24.

International stocks fell a lot further,\" he said. \"But, certainly, I think their analysis is a fair and reasonable assessment about the extent of the impact on 401(k)s.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJack VanDerHei, research director of the Employee Benefit Research Institute, also said the campaign\u2019s calculation was a decent approximation of 401(k) losses after the Brexit vote. Running his own numbers, he came up with an estimated $104 billion loss.\nExperts said, though, that average 401(k) account holders don\u2019t need to panic.\nThe big picture\n\"The number sounds big, but it is a small percent of the total, and it is not as though this money is lost forever,\" Pfau said.\nFour days after the Brexit vote, the U.S. stock market is starting to stabilize and creep back up. Consequently, so are the values of Americans\u2019 401(k)s.\nSpokesmen at 401(k) providers Charles Schwab and Fidelity told us they had received many calls from account holders worried about their assets following the Brexit vote. They both said they encourage clients to stay the course and remember that saving for retirement is a long-term investment that shouldn\u2019t be irreparably harmed by last week\u2019s market volatility.\nGenerally, 401(k) accounts belonging to younger people have a higher concentration of stocks, in order to maximize growth for as long as possible. But as account holders get closer to retirement, they should reduce that concentration, effectively reducing their accounts\u2019 exposure to market volatility, said Fidelity spokesman Mike Shamrell.\n\"People who have the most stock in 401(k) are those who will be impacted the most, so young people,\" Shamrell said. \"But they\u2019ve got the longest until they retire, so years and years and years to make it up.\"\nAlternatively, if someone were to sell some of his or her assets amid the post-Brexit vote market turmoil, that would permanently lock in some of their losses, Pfau said.\nOur ruling\nAfter Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union, \"within 24 hours, Americans lost $100 billion from our 401(k)s,\" Clinton said.\u00a0\nExperts told us that Clinton\u2019s calculation was a reasonable approximation of the loss of 401(k) assets amid market turmoil following the Brexit vote.\nThat being said, those losses are very likely impermanent. 401(k) accounts are long-term investments designed to withstand brief shocks like this.\nThe claim is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate Clinton\u2019s claim Mostly\u00a0True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/84b364ce-64ad-4ea9-adc6-8ec227f42988", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04767"}
