This quote does not belong to Churchill. They cannot be found on the website of Churchill International or in Churchill Archives, which contains more than 800,000 pages of original documents. It is also listed as \"All Quotes 'Winston Churchill never Happy\" by Richard Langworth, Senior Fellow at the Hillsdale College Churchill Project. :: David Freeman, Director of Publications at Churchill International, told Poletti Fuckett that the quote was usually due to Churchill. On January 10, 2021, in an article on Facebook, he said that Nancy Belusi had sent a letter to the Mayor of Portland after demonstrations there \"requiring him to stick to a proven democratic playbook.\" Freeman wrote in an e-mail written by Sierra Aurourke on January 11, 2021 \"It's a common red herring.\" Churchill never said it. The statement stems from an article written by Victor Hugo about 30 years before Churchill was born. The quote is a recent change to an article that Hugo wrote in his 1845 article, \"Filmeen: \"You have enemies? It's the story of every man who's done a great job or made a new idea. It's the cloud that thunders around everything that shines. The fame must have enemies, and the light must be mosquitoes. Don't bother with that. It's contempt. Keep your peace as you keep your life clear.\" Our Facebook article quotes Winston Churchill as she once said that having enemies is good because \"that means you have defended something, sometime in your life.\" The original version of the quotation actually came from Victor Hugo in 1845, not Churchill. This article is wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00204"}
