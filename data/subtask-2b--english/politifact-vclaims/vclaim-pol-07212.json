Rick Perry requiring equal pay for women doing equal work. And in May 2014, Patrick said that as lieutenant governor, he would keep an equal-pay measure from being considered by the full Senate.\nAs recapped by WFAA-TV, Channel 8 in Dallas, Patrick said: \"I do not think that we should have government telling business how to pay their employees whether they\u2019re male or female. I would hold that bill\u2026 Look, women deserve equal pay and if they\u2019re doing a better job than the guy they\u2019re working next to, they deserve more. It\u2019s not up to government.\" Patrick added that the lieutenant governor should protect free markets. \"I don\u2019t want government interfering,\" he said.\nOn Sept. 20, 2014, Tribune CEO Evan Smith interviewed Patrick and Van de Putte back to back on an Austin stage. We watched the video.\nThe equal-pay portion of the conversation opened with Smith asking Patrick to confirm he\u2019d previously said: \"Women should be paid the same as a man, but I don\u2019t believe government should enforce it.\"\n\"Correct,\" Patrick said, adding that pay should be based on an individual\u2019s performance. \"And if a woman does a better job than a man, she deserves to be paid more,\" Patrick said. \"And we have a lot of women business owners. I don\u2019t want the state of Texas telling women business owners you have to pay, listen, you have to pay everyone the same.\"\nSmith then asked if Patrick thought Texas has an equal pay problem or, alternatively, if critics had overblown the issue.\nPatrick: \"You know, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a problem. But to say, are there some businesses that may not treat people fairly? Yes. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a problem. And I think look, I\u2019m a small-business guy; I\u2019ve always had a lot of women work for our company. I want the best employees I can have.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Boysko\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in a committee debate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe United States is the only industrialized, modernized country that does not already have a paid family medical leave program in place.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmith asked next if women who work for Patrick are paid equally as men.\nPatrick: \"In some cases you\u2019d find they are paid more. Look, I\u2019m a business guy and like every businessman and woman, you want the best people. You don\u2019t really care what color they are, where they come from, what gender they are; you want them to do the job.\"\nPatrick then reiterated he doesn\u2019t want the government imposing pay requirements.\nOur ruling\nVan de Putte said Patrick said that if women \"get paid less than a man for the same job, that that\u2019s not a problem.\"\nBroadly, both candidates were vague in their use of \"problem,\" leaving room for interpretation.\nStill, Patrick answered a question by saying he doesn\u2019t think the equal-pay issue is a problem and he hammered his opposition to any state law mandating equal pay. However, Patrick also said some businesses don\u2019t treat people fairly and said any worker should be paid on performance.
