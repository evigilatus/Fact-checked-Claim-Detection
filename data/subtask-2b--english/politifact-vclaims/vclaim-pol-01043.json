(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe rumor originated on BeforeItsNews.com, a junk website long known for spreading false stories and conspiracy theories.\nThe Facebook post uses the first paragraph of the story: \"George Soros was said (to be) arrested in Switzerland at 13:23 GMT on Feb. 3, 2019. Evidently members of what was known as the Alliance stormed his retreat at St. Margrethen Berg, Switzerland, based on a tip from local police. The Alliance was a military force working under orders of the Pentagon, GITMO Military Tribunal Judges and in conjunction with legal entities across the globe.\"\nSoros has not been arrested, in Switzerland or elsewhere. The story is entirely contrived, from the fictional group that allegedly found him down to the web of wrongdoing he is said to have committed.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt one point, the article, which is riddled with misspellings and grammatical errors, claims Soros was arrested via evidence provided by President Barack Obama. It said Obama has been in jail (in Guantanamo Bay) for treason for at least a month and revealed crimes of \"upper echelons of the Deep State to save his own skin.\"\nFirst of all, Obama hasn't been imprisoned for over a month. He was seen in public on Jan. 24 when he met with the Golden State Warriors in Washington. And, of course, if either he or Soros had been imprisoned, it would be huge, international news.\nThere are no sources cited in the story, and no evidence to support it could be found in Swiss or other international media outlets. We also found no statements or reports from Swiss law enforcement on such an arrest.\nThere is also no mention of this on Obama\u2019s website, Soros\u2019 Open Society Foundations website, or either of their social media accounts.\n\"There is no truth to the story whatsoever,\" Laura Silber, chief communications officer for Open Society Foundations, told us. \"It is nonsense from start to finish.\"\nThe outlandish conspiracy theory has since been re-posted on various blogs and websites, and eventually turned into a social media post.\nWe rate it Pants on Fire!\n Share the Facts 2019-02-08 21:28:49 UTC   PolitiFact    1 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Pants on Fire  Says George Soros was arrested in Switzerland for a web of crimes based on information provided by Barack Obama    Bloggers on the internet     Sunday, February 3, 2019 2019-02-03    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01043"}
