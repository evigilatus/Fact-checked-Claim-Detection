Hypocrites! Can we get back to living now???\" one person who shared the image wrote.\n\"Mask?\" another poster wrote. \"Only you SHEEP need masks! No 6ft distance or masks here!

Whitmer declared an emergency.\u00a0\nOn March 12, Whitmer ordered the state\u2019s schools to close for three weeks.\nOn March 13, President Donald Trump declared a national emergency. Whitmer issued a press release that day about a temporary ban on large gatherings and urged people to stay 5 feet away from each other in public settings.\u00a0\u00a0\nOn March 16, Whitmer ordered bars, restaurants, theaters and casinos to close, and she restricted gatherings to less than 50 people.\u00a0\u00a0\nOn March 23, she issued a stay-at-home order.\u00a0\nOn April 1, she declared a state disaster.\nOn April 24, more than a month after Biden\u2019s campaign rally, Whitmer signed an executive order requiring people to wear face coverings in enclosed public spaces.\u00a0\nThis Facebook post, though, suggests that the politicians in the photos are flouting the restrictions that the state has imposed on residents to try to stop the spread of COVID-19.
