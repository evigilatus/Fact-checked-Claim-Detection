Steve Scalise of Louisiana, then the House majority whip, and four others were wounded when Hodgkinson shot at them during their baseball practice. Hodgkinson, who was angry with President Donald Trump and posted rants against Republicans online, was killed by police.\nIn the weeks after, conservative lawmakers called to loosen gun restrictions. Republicans introduced legislation to allow lawmakers to almost always carry a concealed weapon and to allow concealed carry permits obtained in other states to be recognized in the District of Columbia, the New York Times then reported.\nDemocrats opposed the measures. U.S. Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, the House\u2019s nonvoting member from D.C., said it \"is the last place you want to condone or allow concealed-carry weapons\" and \"they are certainly not going to be successful if I have anything to say about it.\"\u00a0\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, and Rahm Emanuel, then Chicago\u2019s mayor, among other Democrats, offered a resolution as part of the U.S. Conference of Mayors to oppose concealed carry bills.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRep.
