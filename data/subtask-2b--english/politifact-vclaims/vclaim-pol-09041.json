For their part, the Democrats are eager to highlight the harm sequestration causes.\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., told reporters this week he was disappointed with what he sees as GOP intransigence.\n\"Let them do whatever they want to do,\" Reid said. \"Talk to the president. My office is always open. I'm anxious to do anything. The sequestration to this point, we have already lost 1.6 million jobs.\"\nThat seemed like a pretty big number for an economy that has added about 1.2 million jobs in the past six months. We emailed Reid\u2019s office to learn the source behind his statement. We did not hear back.\nUnder the rules of sequestration, the government will cut about $85 billion in spending by the end of this fiscal year. Setting aside long-term consequences to the federal debt, putting money into the economy does create jobs and the reverse is also true - less money leads to fewer jobs in the short run.\nWe asked Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, a private research group, what he thought of Reid\u2019s number. His answer was brief.\n\"I have no way of evaluating this at all, there is no official count of job losses due to the sequester,\" Shepherdson said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSal Guatieri, vice president at BMO Capital Markets, another economics research group, also said he had no estimate.\"It is difficult to calculate both the direct and indirect effects,\" Guatieri said.\nBack in February, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that sequestration would reduce the number of jobs by 750,000 by the end of the year. \u00a0That is about half the figure Reid used, and in any event, we are not yet at the end of the year. Reid said we have already lost 1.6 million jobs because of sequestration.\nThe source of Reid\u2019s number seems to be a CBO letter to Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., who asked what would happen if the sequestration were canceled for the rest of this year and 2014.\nThe CBO said that would increase spending by $14 billion in 2013 and about $90 billion the next year. According to its model, this would boost employment by anywhere between 300,000 to 1.6 million. That is a forecast for what would happen in the future, 2014, not an estimate of the sequester\u2019s current impact.\nWhile the number of jobs would rise, the letter also cautions that \"if the spending reductions under current law were reversed, that policy would lead to greater federal debt, which would eventually reduce the nation\u2019s output and income below what would occur under current law.\"\nOur ruling\nReid said that sequestration has already led to the loss of 1.6 million jobs. There is no official estimate of the current impact of the sequester, and Reid's office provided no proof for the claim. The figure Reid seemed to rely on is a projection of the number of jobs that might be created if Congress put the sequester on hold and spent about $100 billion more than is currently planned. And from that forecast, Reid appears to have used the high end.\nWe rate the statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09041"}
