(News outlets have obtained transcripts of prepared witness remarks in some cases.)\u00a0\nBut he is wrong that the hearings have excluded House Republicans, 47 of whom sit on the three committees that have been leading the investigation.\u00a0\nParticipation is based on committee, not party\nThe Constitution says little about procedures for impeachment: The House \"shall have the sole Power of Impeachment\" and the Senate \"shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments.\"\nIn three previous impeachments, the full House authorized inquiries and the House Judiciary Committee took the lead in conducting investigations, holding hearings and voting on whether to approve articles of impeachment.\nThis time around, Pelosi opened the inquiry without a formal vote, a move Republicans criticized. She instructed three House committees \u2014 Oversight, Intelligence and Foreign Affairs \u2014 to carry out an investigation that the House Judiciary Committee will use to draft any articles of impeachment.\u00a0\nThere are nine Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee, 17 are on the House Oversight Committee, and 21 are on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. By contrast, those three committees feature 13, 23 and 26 Democrats, respectively, with four Democrats sitting on two of them at the same time.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJake Tapper\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in remarks in a CNN broadcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second presidential impeachment of Donald Trump was \u201cthe most bipartisan impeachment in American history.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll 47 of those Republicans have been able to participate and ask questions in the interviews and depositions held to this point, said Ashley Etienne, Pelosi\u2019s communications director, in an email. Experts told us the same thing.\nOther House members, such as Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, who organized the Oct. 23 protest, have been kept out of the hearings not because they are Republicans, but because they are not on the relevant committees. And some, such as Rep. Ted Yoho of Florida, have chosen not to attend despite being able to.\nThere is no constitutional provision that says a president or his allies must be allowed to cross-examine witnesses during a House impeachment inquiry.\u00a0\n\"Nothing in either the Constitution or House rules requires public hearings and/or cross-examination at this stage,\" said Ilya Somin, professor of law at George Mason University.\nWhen Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said the inquiry was denying Trump \"due process accorded every American,\" we rated his statement False. If such rights apply at all, they would be granted during the Senate\u2019s trial phase.\n\"The House impeachment inquiry is equivalent to a grand jury investigation in a criminal case,\" said Suzanna Sherry, professor of law at Vanderbilt University. \"And there is no opportunity for cross-examination when evidence is presented to the grand jury.\"\nRepublicans also have the ability to ask questions of witnesses at hearings, Sherry said, which is \"more opportunity for cross-examination than is given to a target of a grand jury investigation.\"\n\"By any ordinary definition, that would amount to \u2018cross-examination,\u2019\" said Frank O. Bowman III, professor of law at the University of Missouri and the author of a book on impeachment.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nLimbaugh said House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry \"doesn\u2019t feature the opposition party, it doesn\u2019t feature cross-examination.\"\nRepublicans on the House Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs committees \u2014 47 in total \u2014 have been able to participate in hearings organized as part of the impeachment inquiry.\u00a0\nWe rate Limbaugh\u2019s statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16844"}
