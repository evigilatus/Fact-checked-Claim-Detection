Alan Grayson warned that Rep. Patrick Murphy\u2019s campaign contributions from Wall Street make him far less progressive than what Democrats need in the upper chamber.\nGrayson made the comment during an interview with the Tampa Bay Times editorial board June 30 when probed about why he doesn\u2019t see eye-to-eye with Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. Grayson cited Schumer\u2019s long history of Wall Street support to explain why their ideologies don\u2019t connect. Then he hypothesized why Schumer backed Murphy over him.\n\"Guess who has taken more money than any Democrat from Wall Street?\" Grayson said, adding that the person was a \"certain second-term congressman from Florida who serves in the financial services committee and has no standing in the committee other than the simple right to vote.\"\nHe continued: \"His name is Patrick Murphy, and he's taken more money from Wall Street than any other member of Congress other than the speaker and the majority leader.\"\nMurphy, of Jupiter, has only been in Congress since 2013, after he switched his party affiliation from Republican to Democrat. We wondered if it was really possible that Murphy received so much money from Wall Street, and why.\nFor this fact-check we\u2019re only looking at direct contributions made to Murphy\u2019s campaign committee, not super PACs or other organizations that can accept unlimited contributions on his behalf. \u00a0\n2016 contributions check out\nWhen looking at just the House, Grayson\u2019s point checks out.\nBut technically, Grayson\u2019s statement to the editorial board said Murphy received more money than anyone else in Congress \u2014 which comprises two chambers. When you add senators into the mix, Murphy\u2019s contributions from Wall Street-types rank No. 19 overall. (Not bad for 535 members, but still not No. 3)\nThat said, it\u2019s pretty clear from context that Grayson was limiting his statement to members of the House, and for some, the House is \"Congress\" and the Senate is the Senate.\n\"\u200bWhile Congress can \u2014 and probably should \u2014 mean both chambers, many people use \u2018Congress\u2019 to refer to the House, and Senate to refer to the Senate,\" said Christopher Mann, an associate professor in the political science department at Skidmore College.\nSenators typically receive more Wall Street money because there are fewer of them, so they have more impact on legislation. In addition, senators have more expensive races and therefore ask for more money.\nLet\u2019s go back to the House. Grayson was referencing a study by the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research group that analyzes campaign donations, that showed Murphy received $1.41 million from the \"finance, insurance and real estate\" sector in the 2016 election cycle.\nThat amount placed Murphy third among all members of the House, with Speaker Paul Ryan at No. 1 with nearly $2 million, and Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., at No. 2 with $1.58 million.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden canceled the Keystone pipeline because Warren Buffett \u201cdonated $58 million\u201d to his campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor similar fact-checks, the Center for Responsive Politics has said the best method to find how much money is being donated by Wall Street workers is to look at a subset of this category, called the \"securities and investment\" sector. This subcategory captures the greatest number of companies associated with Wall Street, without the other fields under the \"finance, insurance and real estate\" umbrella.\nEven if you look at it this way, Murphy still places third for those kind of contributions among members of the House. Murphy received $352,500 from the securities and investment sector, according to a 2016 analysis from the Center for Responsive Politics. Ahead of Murphy is Ryan with $831,272 and McCarthy with $497,850.\nMurphy\u2019s money from Wall Street-related industries amounts to about 4.5 percent of the $7.71 million he\u2019s received so far.\nWhy all the love?\nSo why does Wall Street support Murphy so much? A couple of reasons.\nAs Grayson said, Murphy is a member of the House Committee on Financial Services. Even though he is not a ranking member, he is on two subcommittees that deal with laws related to capital markets and another on monetary policy and trade.\nThese industries want to be on Murphy\u2019s \"good side,\" Mann said.\nThe bigger reason probably has more to do with Murphy\u2019s goal and its location: The U.S. Senate, representing Florida. Florida is an \"expensive state\" for political races, Mann said, and Murphy is going to the industries he knows.\nMurphy has raised more money from three other sectors than Wall Street in his 2015-16 campaign. Murphy raised $721,969 from employees of law firms and lawyers, $595,238 from retirees, and $474,600 from the real estate industry.\nAlso keep in mind that Grayson\u2019s talking point only works for the 2015-16 election cycle. He didn\u2019t specify a point in time for the donations. In his first bid for office in 2012, Murphy received $100,600 from the securities and investment sector. In his 2014 race, Murphy received $255,880 from the securities and investment sector, making him No. 22 among all House members.\nFor the curious, the majority of Grayson\u2019s $2.5 million in contributions comes from retirees, law firms and lawyers, miscellaneous issues, which includes a variety of groups that focus on a single-issue, non-profit institutions and real estate.\nOur ruling\nGrayson said Murphy has \"taken more money from Wall Street than any other member of Congress other than the speaker and the majority leader.\"\nGrayson is right that in the\u00a02015-16 cycle, Murphy raised more money from employees of Wall Street-related fields than any other House member after the House speaker and majority leader. Murphy did not raise as much in his previous two congressional bids, but in context it is clear that Grayson was talking about their current race for the Senate.\nWe rate this statement Mostly True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/8373c4d3-f23b-40ca-a0a0-0b0e845b7522", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04731"}
