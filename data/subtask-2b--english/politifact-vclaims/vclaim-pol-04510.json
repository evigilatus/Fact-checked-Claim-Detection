We've rated the Florida claims Pants on Fire! PolitiFact is also looking at the\u00a0claims about Pennsylvania\u00a0and Ohio in separate fact-checks.\nFor this item, we'll look at the \"fun fact\" at the end of the meme: \"Obama won in every state that did not require a photo ID and lost in every state that did require a photo ID in order to vote.\"\n\nIt's clear from the context that the post is talking about the 2012 election, because it mentions Republican Mitt Romney twice.\nSo did voter ID determine whether Obama won or lost in a state?\nNot at all.\nWe checked with the National Conference of State Legislatures, the nonpartisan Washington-based organization that keeps track of which states have voter identification laws and rates the rigidity of those laws. The group made a tally of the mandatory photo ID laws in effect for the 2012 election.\nIt's true that Obama lost in the states that had a strict photo-only ID requirement in 2012, but merely four states \u2014 Georgia, Indiana, Kansas and Tennessee \u2014 had that requirement, a salient fact the post neglects to mention. (A few more states have added\u00a0a strict photo ID requirement that apply in the 2016 elections.)\nThat a Democrat would lose in those states, regardless of a photo ID requirement, is not surprising.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.

He lost in 20 states that lacked the requirement.\nOn the whole, we rate the statement\u00a0False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ae22eaa3-6b2d-4ae8-b909-e0b3d8f543fd", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04510"}
