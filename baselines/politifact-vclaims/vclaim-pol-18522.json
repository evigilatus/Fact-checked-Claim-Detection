Just exploring the ability to enhance our existing digital ticket capabilities to offer solutions for event organizers that could include testing and vaccine information with 3rd party health providers.\"\nTicketmaster, which sells tickets for some event organizers, doesn\u2019t have the power to make policies concerning COVID-19 safety requirements, the company said. Any such requirements \"always would be up to the discretion of the event organizer, based on their preference and local health guidelines.\"\nWe rate this Instagram post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18522"}
