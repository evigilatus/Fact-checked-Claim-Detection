We called Doherty\u2019s campaign to find out where the candidate got his information.\n\nSpokesman Robert Coupe told us he thought the $601 million figure was pretty large when he first heard it from campaign staffers. He said it came from \"Wastebook 2011,\" the latest edition of an annual compilation of questionable government spending put out by Sen. Tom A. Coburn, R-Oklahoma.\n\nWe checked \"Wastebook 2011,\" which indeed mentions \"over $601 million\" paid out to deceased federal workers in the last five years, with footnotes citing the source: a report issued by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management\u2019s Office of the Inspector General, titled, appropriately enough, \"Stopping Improper Payments to Deceased Annuitants.\"\n\nAccording to the Office of Personnel Management\u2019s report, \"the amount of post-death improper payments is consistently $100-$150 million annually.\"\n\nSome of what the federal government calls \"improper payments\" is outright fraud -- people with electronic access to the deceased\u2019s bank accounts taking the money. And some of it is because the money was electronically transferred into what are now inactive bank accounts. The money can sit there piling up for years before anyone notices.\n\nSpecial efforts have been under way since at least 2005 to reduce payments going to dead retirees and their survivors, the report says. Those efforts have included matching the rolls of eligible recipients with the Social Security Administration\u2019s death records on a weekly and annual basis, doing similar checks with the IRS to see who\u2019s still filing returns, and random phone calls to retirees over 90 years old just to make sure they\u2019re still around.\n\nThose steps have helped identify the scope of the problem, Susan L. Ruge, a spokeswoman in the Office of Personnel Management\u2019s inspector general\u2019s office, said in an e-mail. In fiscal year 2010, for instance, the office identified $116.8 million in improper payments going to dead retirees or survivors.\n\nBut solving the problem is another matter.\n\nAccording to the Personnel Management\u2019s report: \"There remains a high probability that egregious loss of monies from the [civil service] fund will continue and require strategic corrective actions.\" \u00a0It notes one case of a man illegally pocketing more than $515,000 by cashing in his dead father\u2019s monthly retirement checks -- for 37 years.\n\nRuge said 94 percent of annuity payments are transferred electronically into bank accounts as opposed to the older method of mailing checks. The office of inspector general, she said, has no breakdown as to payments stolen by others with access to those accounts and money lost by languishing into those unattended accounts.\n\n\"In overpayment cases where no theft has occurred, there is greater potential for EFT (electronic fund transfer) overpayments to continue undetected, simply because no one is monitoring the deceased annuitant\u2019s bank account,\" said Ruge.\n\nIf there is good news in any of this it is this: while $601 million going to dead people in the last five years sounds like a lot of money, it represents less than 2.5 percent of all civil service retirement disbursements, the report claims.\n\nOur Ruling\n\nDoherty\u2019s website says \"Over the past five years the federal government has paid out $601 million in retirement and disability benefits to deceased former federal employees.\"\n\nThe campaign accurately quoted a figure whose source is a report issued by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management\u2019s Office of the Inspector General.\n\nWe rate his statement True.\n\nRhode Island\u2019s former top cop is setting his bar of expectation pretty high if he\u2019s promising to curb this kind of \u00a0\"rampant fraud and waste.\" We\u2019ll be watching.\n\nGet updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.
