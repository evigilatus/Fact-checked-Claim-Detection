According to the White House's Office of Management and Budget, the nation's entire 2007 national defense budget \u2014 which includes atomic energy and defense-related activities in the departments of Homeland Security, Justice, State and Commerce \u2014 is $570 billion. That's about 4.2 percent of GDP. So, Huckabee's off, but not by much.\n\n\nHere's the bigger problem. In his statement, Huckabee seems to be comparing federal government spending on the military to total spending in the U.S. on health care. Not just government money, but also private spending.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHis campaign didn't return phone calls to explain what he meant or from where he drew his statistics. But his 17 percent of GDP most closely resembles a figure cited by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the federal agency responsible for administering health programs. It reported in January 2007 that the U.S. is projected to spend about 16.2 percent of GDP on national health expenditures this year, or about $2.3-trillion.\n\n\nBut that's everything. What the federal government spends, what state and local governments spend, what private citizens spend.\n\n\nThe same study shows that if you subtract private sector money from the equation, health care expenses by the federal government drop to 5.5 percent of GDP. Add in state and local government spending and you get to 7.6 percent of GDP.\n\n\nOf course, \"we,\" all of us, make up the private sector. So Huckabee has every right to include the private with public expenses when citing the true cost of U.S. health care in proportion to GDP.\nBut comparing that with government-only spending on the military, or anything else, artificially inflates the disparity between the two costs.\n\n\n\nEditor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.
