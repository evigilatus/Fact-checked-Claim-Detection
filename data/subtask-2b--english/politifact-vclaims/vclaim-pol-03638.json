That part is accurate.\nBut the story veers into false territory by saying Target CEO Bryan Hornell claimed the chain \"will no longer cater to religious extremists\" by selling the Bible. Hornell allegedly said in a letter that Targets would start phasing out anything related to religion \u2014 including Christmas decorations \u2014 in its stores.\nThere are many examples of this story all over the Internet, but none of them are true.\nThey\u2019re all based on a (currently deleted) May 16, 2016, story from NationalReport.net, a site that generates made-up articles. \"All news articles contained within National Report are fiction, and presumably fake news,\" its disclaimer reads.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat disclaimer isn\u2019t on the stories themselves, and don\u2019t look to appear on earnest reposts of the article on other sites.\nBeyond that, there are clues that this isn\u2019t a real story, starting with the fact that the chairman and CEO of Target is Brian Cornell, not Bryan Hornell.\nAs for being able to buy the good book, a search of the Target.com website turns up 791 results in a search for \"Holy Bible,\" so it\u2019s readily available.\nBut just to make sure, we contacted Target\u2019s public relations department, which assured us that yes, you can still buy the Bible in stores. And no, there were no plans to change that.\nTarget did eventually start offering private bathrooms to try to settle the boycott over transgendered bathrooms, but it never said it would stop selling the Bible.\nWe rate this statement Pants On Fire!\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/eb166a41-f45d-47df-87c1-3df849991812", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03638"}
