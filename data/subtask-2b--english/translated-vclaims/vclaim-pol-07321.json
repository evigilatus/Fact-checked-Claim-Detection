Paul wrote: \"They shouldn't be. \"I have said since the beginning of public life that I am not isolated, I am not involved. I look at the world, and I think of war, real and constitutional.\" Paul goes on to describe the state of world affairs during the term of office of President Barack Obama, including in Libya after the fall of Governor Muammar Gaddafi. \"Libya is a safe haven and a safe haven for training and arming terrorists from North Africa to Syria,\" said Paul. \"Our abandoned embassy in Tripoli is controlled by militants. Today, jihadists swim in the pool of our embassy. Paul doubled this assertion after 10 September after Obama announced its strategy to deal with the Islamic State terrorist organization in Iraq and Syria. Are there really jihadists swimming in the pool of our embassy in Tripoli? So we decided to take a look. Are the militants occupying the embassy and damaging it? Since Qaddafi was expelled three years ago by rebel groups with the help of French and American air strikes, Libya has been in a state of chaos, with weak central government, and warring secular and Muslim factions fighting to control the State. The renewed violence in the Libyan capital, Tripoli, forced the United States and several allies, including Spain and France, to withdraw their embassy staff from the city in July, leaving behind unoccupied diplomatic posts. Paul's statement refers to an amateur video published on YouTube that appeared in mid - August. In this, a large group of Libyans orbiting a swimming pool, while men jump from a balcony from the second class to the water. According to The New York Times, a man was heard saying, \"This was the American Embassy. God is great!\" Since the release of the video - before the publication of Paul's article - many other details have been reported exactly what happened. For starters, the man in the video identified the compound's error as the \"American Embassy.\" On Twitter, United States. Ambassador Deborah Jones of Libya wrote that the video \"seems to be a residential supplement from the United States Mission, but it cannot be said conclusively since he did not exist.\" This was verified by the Associated Press and the New York Times on 31 August. In another article on Twitter, Jones added: \"As far as I know and my latest picture, the United States Embassy in Tripoli and its compound are now being protected and not looted.\" The United States Embassy in Tripoli is about half a mile from the photographer site. Are the men jihadist? The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 On January 11, 2012, Paul further questioned that those occupying the housing complex were mujahideen. Since the fall of Qadhafi, local militia groups, including some leaders of the revolution, have maintained law enforcement and government functions throughout the country. However, fighting between various militias has recently escalated. In July, a militia group, the dawn of Libya, seized the capital and Tripoli airport after weeks of fighting by rival militias from Zintan city. The Libyan dawn also pushed the Zintan forces outside the United States compound. After these fights, the video was taken in the pool. After the video was released, the leaders of the Libyan Dawn sought to clear the air and assure the rest of the world that their efforts were aimed at securing embassy complexes, rather than looting and destroying American property. They even invited embassy workers back. (This is not likely to happen.) The leaders of the Libya Dawn allowed Associated Press reporters to watch the facilities. They reported minor damage to housing and that \"the villa in the compound does not appear to have been looted.\" The leader of Libya's dawn told them: \"This place is safe and under protection.\" Their troops were guarding the Embassy from other militia groups. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the police that the embassy in Tripoli was \"safe.\" The experts with whom we spoke about Down Libya warned that much of the information and intelligence coming from Libya is false. While the term \"jihadist\" is ambiguous, it often refers to Islamic extremism involving violence, terrorism and/or suicide attacks in the name of a pure Islamic State. Within this definition, it will be difficult to describe the Libyan dawn as \"Jehadion,\" as the experts have said. Kareem Mazran, a senior resident of the Rafik Hariri Middle East Centre of the Atlantic Council, said, \"This is a ridiculous simplification at all.\" By using the term \"the dawn of Libya,\" Mezran said that groups were fighting for political reasons with dangerous terrorist organizations. Libya blew up an umbrella group of several local Islamic militias, but the bulk of its forces consist of rebel fighters from the city of Misrata. They fought some of the most violent battles against the Qadhafi forces during the Libyan revolution. While supporting the Islamic Party in government, they are not considered extremists. In fact, the group rejected applications to join an alliance with Ansar al-Sharia, the terrorist organization responsible for the attacks on the Benghazi compound two years ago that resulted in the death of Ambassador Chris Stevens. Ansar al-Sharia is on the watch list of terrorists in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The dawn of Libya is not. Ansar al-Sharia called for the unification of the dawn of Libya under a common slogan, and said Wayne White, a former Deputy Director of the Intelligence and Research Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Near East and South Asia. \"We oppose terrorism, we oppose extremism,\" Wyatt said, now with the Middle East Institute. \"I have avoided what could have been a valuable alliance with the East to prove that he is not a terrorist or extremist militia.\" White added that individuals or small groups of people could be extremist within any organization, and intelligence on groups that had since joined the umbrella organization was incomplete. However, history has shown that the core group \"was not known for brutal and deadly attacks,\" but instead as \"a very proud military force that bore the brunt of the Qadhafi forces\" during the revolution, as Wyatt said. The governor Paul said that in Tripoli, the jihad today swims in the pool of our embassy. The prosecution stems from a video showing members of the Libyan Dawn militia diving in a swimming pool. However, it was found that the pond was not in the American Embassy, but in a residential annex half a mile away. More critical, people described in the video as \"Jehad\" is, at best, exaggerated. The responsible group is an organization of militias engaged in political and regional war, but rejected alliances with terrorist organizations. Reports from Tripoli indicate that the group left the property largely intact, and United States officials said that the compound \"maintains safe.\" Christian Christians will not be able to obtain these imperfect expressions of Paul's comments, so we appreciate that the one claiming the same truth.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07321"}
