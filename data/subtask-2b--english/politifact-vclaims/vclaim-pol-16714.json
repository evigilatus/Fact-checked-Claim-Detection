Because they have AI technology that now is using facial recognition to identify protesters if they so much as do anything on the street, so they can follow up with them and detain them later.\"\nWe wondered if Yang\u2019s description of Hong Kong\u2019s artificial intelligence capabilities was accurate, so we decided to dig into the matter.\u00a0\nWe found that the ban on face masks has been stalled in the courts, and the facial recognition technology has not necessarily been used in the way Yang suggested.\nThe face-mask ban is currently lifted, pending appeal\nHong Kong is a part of China but governs itself independently. That \"one country, two systems\" setup has been in place since the United Kingdom returned the former colony to China in 1997.\nIn June, pro-democracy protesters took to the streets to rebel against a Chinese bill that would have allowed for extradition from Hong Kong to China for certain serious crimes.\nEven after the bill was withdrawn, the unrest has continued, with protesters pushing for larger demands and Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam\u2019s resignation.\nIn October, Lam invoked emergency powers to ban protesters from wearing face masks, making the act punishable by fines and jail time. A court in Hong Kong ruled the ban unconstitutional the next month before allowing it to be temporarily reinstated days later.\nThen, in December, the South China Morning Post reported that a court lifted the ban again, pending an appeal that is set to take place in January.\u00a0\nSo currently, there\u2019s no ban in place, but the final decision has not been made. Acting chief judge of the High Court Jeremy Poon Shiu-chor wrote that his ruling to lift the ban for the time being \"in no way determined the appeals one way or the other.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If one is to continue to wear masks ... in the meantime, he has to face the inherent risk of having acted contrary to the law should the (government) later succeed on appeal,\" he said.\nS.Y. Lee, national press secretary for the Yang campaign, told us that Yang\u2019s statement is \"still correct\" in light of the recent court decision to lift the ban. \"The Chinese government moved to ban and still wants to ban face masks, regardless of the court's decision,\" he said.\nIt\u2019s unclear how facial recognition technology is being used\nLee cited articles in the New York Times and Bloomberg to back up the second part of Yang\u2019s claim \u2014 that Hong Kong is using facial recognition technology to identify unmasked protesters they can later detain. The New York Times report detailed China\u2019s surveillance powers.\nThe Bloomberg story got more to Yang\u2019s point. That report, which relied in part on anonymous sources, said that law enforcement in Hong Kong has access to artificial intelligence software that can scan video footage and match faces and license plates to police databases.\u00a0\nBut the report also said it\u2019s \"unclear\" if the technology has been steered toward targeting Hong Kong\u2019s protesters. The software can be useful for other purposes, such as finding lost children, and Hong Kong\u2019s leaders have not publicly said they are using it on protesters, denying in one case a request from Buzzfeed for information related to its use of the technology.\nFrom what we can tell, it\u2019s possible \u2014 but not proven \u2014 that the government is deploying the technology to monitor protests for suspects to detain. City residents are certainly suspicious.\nOur ruling\nYang said, \"They banned face masks in Hong Kong. Why? Because they have AI technology that now is using facial recognition to identify protesters if they so much as do anything on the street, so they can follow up with them and detain them later.\"\nYang\u2019s claim is on the right track; the government in Hong Kong has tried to ban the use of face masks, and it is reportedly capable of using facial recognition technology against its protesters.\nBut the ban has been lifted for the time being, and it has not been definitively reported that the city\u2019s law enforcement authorities are using facial recognition to find and hold suspects.\nOverall, the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important context.
