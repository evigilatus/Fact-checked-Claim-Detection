Rick Scott asked the Legislature to send more money to education during his State of the State address on Jan. 10, 2012 -- and he said he\u2019s not kidding.\n\n\"My recommended budget includes $1 billion in new state funding for education,\" Scott said. \"And I ask you to please consider that recommendation very carefully. On this point, I just cannot budge. \u2026 This is the single most important decision we can make today for Florida\u2019s future.\"\n\nBut the $1 billion isn\u2019t purely \"new\" additional funding as Scott said. About $190 million is needed to pay for 30,000 more students expected for next year, and another $220 million goes to make up for a 3 percent drop in property values.\n\nAnother problem with Scott\u2019s claim to support \"new\" education funding: It doesn\u2019t make up for budget cuts that Scott signed into law just last year.\n\nThis hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed by Democrats in state government. Sen. Nan Rich, D-Weston, called Scott\u2019s fervor for education funding \"new-found.\"\n\n\"The bottom line is that we would still be funding education at a level hundreds of millions of dollars less than we did in 2007 if the governor\u2019s proposal is passed. It won\u2019t make up for the $1.35 billion that the Legislature cut from K-12 education last session,\" Rich said in a newsletter to constituents in December.\n\nWe went looking for budget documents and news reports on the matter, and we soon confirmed last year\u2019s education cuts. We even found evidence of the decline in Scott\u2019s own budget documents on his Let\u2019s Get to Work website. (See page 33 of this chart.)\n\nScott\u2019s data shows a few interesting trends. Starting with fiscal year 2003, total education funding climbed every year, reaching $18.75 billion in 2007. It then dipped to $17.92 billion in 2008, before climbing again to $18 billion in 2009 and $18.22 billion in 2010, thanks largely to federal economic stimulus funds.\n\nIn 2011, funding dropped to $16.58 billion, according to interim calculations. Scott\u2019s proposal to add state funds would push total funding to $17.15 billion in 2012. As Rich noted, that\u2019s still below pre-recession levels.\n\nScott is right that he wants to add roughly $1 billion in funding for schools this year, but we think it\u2019s disingenuous to call that money \"new\" -- a descriptor that gives people a distinct impression that education funding is up. Some of that $1 billion in funding is to pay for new students and to close a gap created by lost funding from declining property values. And it doesn\u2019t quite make up for the deeper cuts Scott signed off on a year ago. We rate his statement Half True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11823"}
