RIGGED ELECTION in waiting!\" he tweeted on Thursday.\nNorth Carolina could prove key for Trump in the upcoming election, and he has previously\u00a0 tweeted questionable information about the state.\u00a0\nSo is this more recent tweet true?\nElection officials in Mecklenburg County this week announced that a mixup with the first wave of absentee ballots caused some voters to receive two identical ballots, the Associated Press reported. Fewer than 500 voters were affected, Mecklenburg\u2019s election director Michael Dickerson told the AP.\nAs for the suggestion that North Carolina\u2019s election could be \"rigged,\" North Carolina\u2019s election director said the state\u2019s ballot management system will not allow a voter to vote twice in an election.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJenna Wadsworth\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth Carolina Secretary of State Elaine Marshall \"has won more statewide races than probably anyone else alive.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Paul Specht \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Each absentee voter has a unique identifier barcode for their return application, and the state system will not permit two ballots from the same person to be accepted or counted,\" Karen Brinson Bell said in a statement on Thursday.\n\"Once one ballot is returned and accepted, the voter\u2019s record reflects that he or she has already voted,\" she said. \"Therefore, if that voter returned another ballot, it would not count.\nThe state has already processed 88,000 of 817,000 ballots that have been mailed out, she said.\nThe president\u2019s claim contains an element of truth: an elections board sent two ballots to about 500 voters. But it ignores some very important context: North Carolina election officials say their ballot-counting system doesn\u2019t allow an individual\u2019s quote to be counted twice.\nThat means this type of mistake is very unlikely to alter or \"rig\" the election, as Trump suggests.\nSo we rate this claim Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18981"}
