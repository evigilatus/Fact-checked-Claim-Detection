The posts suggest that the fast-food chain distributed the shirts following the recent protests over police brutality.\nThe image in the post shows Chick-fil-A workers wearing the shirts through a drive-thru window.\nThe caption above the photo starts with, \"As a retort to \u2018BLACK LIVES MATTER.\u2019\"\nSome of the words aren\u2019t readable, but the caption concludes with: \"Be careful who you patronize. They may want your $$, but make a mockery of our oppression and pain. I hear you loud and clear tho (sic). I think y\u2019all trash anyway.\"\n\n\u00a0\nThis is misleading. The photograph is several years old and was worn in support of a local high school football team at one Chick-fil-A location in Texas, the company says.\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Not now, not ever. It cannot be tolerated.\"\nOur ruling\nSocial media users are sharing an image of Chick-fil-A workers wearing \"Back the Blue\" shirts and claim the company distributed them to employees as a response to recent protests over police brutality.\nThe photo is outdated and was taken in 2015 at one Chick-fil-A location in Texas. There are some conflicting reports about whether the shirts were also meant to honor local police officers, but the company repeatedly said the shirts were made to solely support a local high school football team.\nBut the shirts were not distributed to Chick-fil-A employees across the country as a response to the current protests.
