Christ and Jove. Rick Scott argued about the restoration of civil rights during the 21 October debate on CNN. \"When I was governor, I brought the restoration of rights to non-violent criminals so they could get a chance to get a job,\" said Christ. Unfortunately, under Rick Scott's rule, he's gone, and there's only five years left, you can't even apply.\" \"Here's Charlie's plan.\" You commit a heinous crime once you're out of jail, you'll vote. Chasing, you get a vote as soon as you get out. You have permanent malformation deliberately a child, you get out of jail, you get right away to vote. This is wrong, Charlie. Christ: \"This is basically unfair. I said non-violent criminals. You're lying again.\" Scott: \"No, that's not true. Go to \"The Facts of Four Loreda.\" Com, Charlie. You want to look at yourself, you can look for him. That's exactly what I did. And I completely disagree with that.\" Christ: \"This is so unfair. Go to his location if you want, but I recommend you go to Vershot Florida instead, and you'll find out the truth. What he just said is completely wrong.\" Well, we advise you, if you want facts, to go to Pulitevet. (We're glad you're here!) Does Christ want violent criminals to regain their right to vote immediately? In one word, no. Since 1968, the Council of Ministers has the power to restore rights to criminals, with various governors making changes to make them more difficult or easier. These changes were not always on party lines: Chilean democratic law strengthened the rules, while Republicans extended Bush's pocket, although advocates pushed for further reforms. In April 2007, under Christ &apos; s guidance, Christ and the Council of Ministers agreed to relax the rules so as to make it easier for criminals to regain their civil rights, including the right to vote. (Krist was a Republican at the time, and now he's running as a Democrat to get his old job back.) This step was defended by Christ in a 2007 op-ed article: \"Some who prefer the current system say that the restoration of civil rights is somehow \"vulnerable to the crime,\" as if the restoration of the right to vote, jury service or employment reduces punishment or encourages a person to commit new crimes. In fact, the opposite should be true. Giving a person a meaningful way to return to society, earning a living and participating in our democracy will encourage good behaviour.\" In the context of the 2007 changes, there were specific rules for three levels of offenders who could apply for their rights. All of them had first to terminate their sentences, including conditional release and restitution of rights. About 80 per cent of the criminals were eligible for the speedy restoration of their civil rights without hearings, and the Tampa Bay Times reported when the new rules were approved. Offenders convicted of more serious crimes, such as murder, must take additional steps to seek restitution of their rights, including attending an official hearing. \u2022 Level 1: Criminals convicted of less serious crimes such as drug burglary, drug abuse or drug sale have reviewed cases for eligibility, and the Mercy Board can sign for restitution without holding a hearing. That was almost automatic. On February 8, 2021, Greg Kelly reported on the newsmax section \"Only one person died that day\" during the January 6 US riots. \u2022 February 9, 2012: Level 2: Criminal offenders convicted of aggravated battery, criminal pursuit, or trafficking in cocaine. An inquiry was required to determine eligibility, and the Council had 30 days to review the results, but the State did not hold a hearing. \u2022 Level 3: perpetrators include murderers and sexual predators. These cases require a more thorough investigation, and they should have been represented at a hearing. There is another way for violators - at any level - to regain their rights. If they had completed all their sentences, including probation and compensation, and had been free from crimes and 15 years of detention, they could have applied for restitution. We asked the State how many of the 156,000 restorations occurred under Christ's rules in each category and were unable to obtain that information. Most of the perpetrators &apos; records are confidential. Mark Schlackman, Senior Programme Manager, Florida State University Centre for the Promotion of Human Rights, said. (Shalkman is a supporter of the restoration of the civil rights of offenders). But it is likely that some have committed a violent crime at some point, as one prominent researcher has said, to deprive criminals of their rights. \"I didn't examine the restoration of Florida enough to see if anyone with any violent arrest ever had his civil rights restored, but I think that's the case,\" said the sociologist at the University of Minnesota Christopher Ogen. In 2011, at the urging of Attorney General Bam Bondi, Scott and the Cabinet reversed the policy under Christ and set a minimum waiting period of five years for non-violent offenders. During the state of Scott until mid-September, 1,589 persons were granted rehabilitation. We asked Christ's campaign spokesman, Kevin Kate, if Christ wanted to repeat the three classes. \"You will work with the Cabinet to restore a fair and just process for non-violent criminals, a reform to restore their civil rights,\" said Kate. Scott says that Christ's policy includes violent criminals. He told the audience that the criminals who committed these \"big\" crimes could be released from prison and vote immediately. But no one automatically recovered their rights while he was out of prison. All perpetrators must complete their sentences, including probation and compensation, before they are eligible. Even at the lowest level of perpetrators, the State has yet to review their cases for eligibility and the Mercy Council has had to sign them. State policy under Christ included a list of some serious violent crimes, such as murder, which excluded criminals from a faster process of obtaining their rights without a formal hearing. But Scott Greg Blair's spokesman noted that many violent crimes were not on that list -- leaving the possibility that violent criminals would have access to the fastest process to obtain their rights. This includes beating or ill-treatment of an elderly person, possession or firing of a firearm on the school &apos; s property, threatening a witness, injuring or killing a police dog, resisting arrest with violence or torturing animals. \"You can ask a legal expert which one is technically classified as \"violent,\" although I can say with some certainty that the abuse of the nursing home and the beating of the elderly are considered. \u2219 Resisting violent arrest, this person in his name. So yeah, violent criminals can get rights back under Charlie Christ, \"He said Blair. Our judgment, Scott, said that Christ wanted criminals who committed \"a heinous crime\" like \"a deliberate permanent mutilation of a child\" to get out of prison and immediately get the right to vote. The Council of Ministers, led by Christ, has made it easier for criminals to recover their rights, but they have not regained those rights once they leave prison. The perpetrators must complete their sentence, including probation, in order to meet the required conditions. And then the Mercy Council had to sign the restoration. The most serious perpetrators of the violence had to be investigated and heard. The only core of the truth here is that it is possible that some of the criminals who committed violent crimes recovered their rights, but not immediately after they left prison. So we're mostly assessing this allegation wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07074"}
