Trump's charges of electoral fraud are not new to his campaign. He wrote on Twitter about the dead voters who won President Barack Obama in 2012, charged multiple votes in the run-up to the elections, and suggested that undocumented migrants \"enter and vote only\" in some polling places. Trump revived these theories while he was lagging behind Hillary Clinton in polls (which, according to his alternatives, are \"deranged.\" \"Nov8, we'd better be careful, because those elections will be forged,\" he said at the march of August 1 in Columbus, Ohio. \"People will come in and vote 10 times, maybe, who knows?\" \"I know last time, you had areas where there was practically no one voting for the Republican (Mitt Romney), and he told Sean Fox News the same night. \"I'm telling you, Nov 8, we'd better be careful because the elections are gonna be fake and I hope the Republicans are watching closely, or they're gonna be taken from us.\" This is a serious allegation challenging the fairness of the elections, so we asked the Trump campaign to expand. We didn't hear a reply. When Trump shows details -- people who vote despite their incompetence, people who vote several times, people who impersonate dead voters -- he actually talks about voter fraud, perpetrated by individuals and perpetrated very rarely. Stealing the 2012 election? In order to raise doubts about the 2016 elections, Trump referred to alleged fraud in 2012. While some constituencies in Philadelphia voted exclusively for Obama in 2012, the hay perception of this claim is evidence of electoral fraud. In defending Trump, Sean Hannity Fox referred to the article Philadelphia Inquire, which showed 59 areas in the centre of Philadelphia City where \"Mett Romney did not get one vote, not one. But Hannity overlooks that the same article also stated that \"these results may not be very impressive at the end of the day.\" Inquireer wrote that 75 to 80 per cent of voters in major cities like Philadelphia recognized Democrats, and 93 per cent of African Americans voted for Obama. When the newspaper searched for a few registered Republicans living in 59 provinces, it found that many of them had moved, while others did not realize that they were registered with the party, and others confirmed that they had voted for Obama despite their political identity. :: Electoral inspector Ryan Godfrey, an independent who was a Republican in 2012, called Haniti &apos; s allegations \"dissolved and personally offensive.\" After all, Godfrey argued, there was a paper trail of the ballots in Philly and there was no evidence that he and the other election officials risked prosecuting complicity against Romney. In addition, Brian Stiller responded from CNN, \"Google research will show that there are also areas in other states, such as Utah, where Obama did not get a single vote. Nor does Trump &apos; s accusation of fraud against voters, echoing arguments in favour of voter identification laws, reflect reality. While the United States Government Accountability Office has acknowledged that it is difficult to estimate the number of instances of voter fraud based on reported incidents, there is no evidence of fraud. News 21 found 150 cases of alleged double voting, 56 cases of non-citizens voting and 10 cases of voter impersonation in all elections from 2000 to 2011. Many of these cases did not lead to charges, while others were acquitted or dismissed. Justin Levitte, a professor at the Faculty of Law of Loyola and an expert on voter fraud, found fewer: 31 credible incidents out of over 1 billion votes were made between 2000 and 2014. Put it another way: You're more likely to get lightning than you can find the tricky voter. On January 18, 2021, in an interview with the right national radio program, \"China was behind intervention and effort to overthrow our government and elections, electoral fraud.\" \u2022 January 19, 2012, when voter fraud occurs, it is not always intentional. Multiple studies have tracked known cases not to deliberate deception but to clerical errors or confusion. For example, the case of a dead person (Alan J. Mandel) occurred because one of the polling staff had accidentally marked his name instead of the man who had already voted, Alan J. Mandel. Similarly, in only one of five cases of non-citizen voting between 2000 and 2004, a permanent resident was informed that he was eligible, and the voter registration form was given by a staff member of the Department of Self-Defense when his licence was renewed. Therefore, given the scarcity of occurrence, lack of intent, and the federal penalty of $10,000 or even five years in prison, experts say that it would be extremely difficult to manipulate elections through the methods proposed by Tramp. \"I'd like to see him try to vote 10 times on election day. It was practically impossible and a clich\u00e9 to try to ruin the election,\" said Lauren Minnet, Professor of Political Science at Rutgers University, who wrote the legend of voter fraud. In order to influence the elections, an army of voters must visit multiple polling sites, identify the names and addresses of persons who have been impersonating themselves and producing false identity cards or providing their signatures - in addition to their willingness to testify on the right all the time. \"Camps don't pay people to pretend they're not. Mary Francis Perry, former President of the United States Civil Rights Commission and author of $5 and a pork sandwich, said the book on electoral fraud. How elections can be manipulated from Tamani Hall in New York to the slogan \"early and often\" that has become common in Chicago, electoral fraud is certainly part of the political history of the United States. But today's manipulation of elections is limited by local elections, because the process of stealing national elections will be extremely difficult. \"In view of the decentralized nature of our elections, there will be no single way to present the results,\" said Richard Hasen, an electoral law expert at the University of California, Irvine. \"Instead, you have to target sufficient mandates to make a difference in the electoral college.\" The first method is through the purchase of votes, especially absence cards. It refers to the Louisiana woman &apos; s vote prize, and documents several cases of local campaigns and political instruments that buy votes, mostly from care homes and poor communities, in exchange for cash, whiskey or a paved passage. This is possible on a small scale because of a \"bad deal\" between local electoral officials and \"family fiefdoms\" deeply rooted in municipal politics, as Perry said. On the other hand, the presidential elections are subject to much greater scrutiny than the races of the sheriff and to federal prosecution. For this reason, and given the complexity of organizing a conspiracy in different societies, Perry argues that it is unlikely that a national campaign or an outside group will risk buying some votes. The second method of electoral fraud is by manipulating voting machines (see you, Olivia Pope, from scandals). Trump proposed this in 2012 when he warned that the machines were turning Romney's voices into Obama. \"This is not evidence that the system is being manipulated. This is an indication that she lost the calibration,\" Pamela Smith said from the verified vote, which monitors technological issues in the elections. Trump was more likely to refer to voter reports on this common issue of overuse, while electoral fraud \"will require you not to notice.\" (Smith couldn't think of any examples of the machines being manipulated and said, from her research, that matters usually result from programming errors.) However, ballots on some electronic voting systems have no paper trail, which means that votes are not verifiable. Hackers can theoretically change the results. But this also requires a potential abuser of physical access to machines on election day and serious coordination to circumvent all existing security and auditing measures before, during and after the vote, Smith said, \"There are very few paths in the current scenario to turn something off the radar.\" There is additional security for the Pennsylvania Act, which requires post-election voting audits in randomly selected areas. Most districts in Virginia rely on ballot papers. And Florida, where the use of electronic machines is to some extent limited to providing access to voters with disabilities, has a Republican Governor (Gov). Rick Scott, a supporter of Trump, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs (who oversees the elections). Hasen said: \"The most classic technological manipulation or filling of ballot boxes is not the kind of thing that can easily be done or on a scale that can affect elections.\" \"The unsupported allegations of Trump are dangerous and imaginary.\" Our sentence, Trump, has repeatedly claimed that the U.S. election system is a forgery. He cited examples of voter fraud, which was extremely rare, often unintended and not large enough to influence national elections. While there are isolated examples of local elections purchased, experts say they cannot be replicated at the national level. While electronic voting machines can be manipulated, there is no evidence that intentional irregularities have changed any elections. We appreciate Trump's claim for pants on fire. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/cc4ab7b-5c25-49da-99c2-f86e08a8e0a3", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04474"}
