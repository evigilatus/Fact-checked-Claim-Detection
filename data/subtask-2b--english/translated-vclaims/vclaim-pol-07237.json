According to Scott Walker's Jobs Strategy, the Republican Governor \"generally believes that you grant tax exemptions to those at the top and in private interests and in some way stumble and create jobs.\" \"Well, I'm a businessman. This was not the way jobs were created, \"as opposed to Burke, who used to work at Trick's bike company. \"So, it's a flawed model and I have a very different model and I'm presenting in my job plan the five basic strategies on how to do this,\" followed by Burke, before making a claim that we want to verify. \"This means that we need a more organized business climate in Wisconsin. This is one of them (five strategies). Now, we're 46 in the country in terms of new businesses started.\" Only that day, we assessed the validity of Walker's claim that Wisconsin ranked eleventh in \"the growth of total businesses,\" compared to 47 in the years that Burke was Minister of Commerce. Therefore, we wondered whether Burke's claim was incompatible with that. As we'll see, the terms are the key. Various measures refer to \"business enterprises,\" a term that means a place of business, such as a new store, a new factory or a new farm. One company may have multiple \"enterprises,\" and existing or new firms may open new ones. It is therefore a special measure. The terms Burke are different from those of Walker, and they refer to a different measurement stick. In October 2013, days after her candidacy for governor was announced, Burke said Wisconsin was 49 in the U.S. in \"Creating New Business.\" We've estimated that it's mostly true. Burke cited the Kaufman Entrepreneurship Index, an annual study prepared by the non-partisan Kaufman Foundation, a group located in Kansas City that promotes entrepreneurship. Mr. Stewart Thornhill, Executive Director of the Institute of Entrepreneurship Studies at the University of Michigan, told us that this was a measure widely mentioned. The indicator uses census data in the United States to record the number of new business owners in the first month of their significant business activity. In the 2013 Kaufman Index, Wisconsin was linked to Michigan in 48 states in the number of entrepreneurs per 100,000 people, just before Nebraska and Minnesota. So, what's the landscape now? Her 2014 campaign cited the Kaufman Index in the evidence presented by Burke in support of Burke &apos; s new claim. In the first month of significant business activity: Professional/State entrepreneurs per 100,000 people stated that Jordan Rachel verified the facts on 16 January 2021 in tweeting A that the minimum wage of $15 per hour would raise the price of Taco Bell burrito to $38. By Bill McCarthy: January 20, 2021 U.S. average 280 T, Wisconsin, Washington 170 T, Minnesota, Indiana 160 Rhode Ios 140 Iowa 110, so Wisconsin is actually one inch higher than Burke pointed out. On the one hand, a link to 45 is an improvement from 48 in the 2013 index. On the other hand, the Wisconsin 2014 rate of 170 entrepreneurs per 100,000 people is actually lower than the 2013 rate of 180. Montana ranked number one in both 2013 and 2014. In 2014, the rate was 610 entrepreneurs per 100,000 persons). The spokesman for the Walker Allie Mary campaign pointed out that, in our previous examination of the facts in Burke, the Kaufman Foundation warned that its indicator was not intended to provide a precise arrangement for states. In fact, however, its report does so by reporting accurate estimates and isolating states in the top five of the highest and lowest groups. Marie also cited other business creation statistics, including Walker's claim for overall enterprise growth. But, again, that's a different scale than the one Burke mentioned. Our classification of Burke says Wisconsin is 46 in the country in terms of starting new business. They actually link 45 of the known Kaufman Index, in terms of new business owners in the first month of their important business activity. We're mostly evaluating the statement right.
