You want to help the military? I need just as much money for domestic discretionary spending.\n\"That was the Obama rule that we lived under for eight years. They insisted on this even as our military plunged further and further into a readiness crisis. Well, we got to a point that our Air Force pilots were going to museums to find spare parts over the last eight years.\"\nSo, this is a sweeping claim: Air Force pilots, crippled by inadequate funding, being forced to scavenge for parts in museums to keep their own planes flying.\nTypically we don\u2019t use many quotes in our fact checks. But in this case, they seem to tell the story about Ryan\u2019s claim:\n\n\n\"That\u2019s a grotesque distortion,\" said Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis for the Teal Group Corp., which does research on the aerospace and defense industry.\n\n\n\n\n\"It\u2019s grossly misleading,\" said Benjamin Friedman, a Cato Institute defense and homeland security studies research fellow.\n\n\n\n\n\"While I admire Ryan, and agree that there are some problems in military readiness, this kind of hyperbole needs to be called out,\" said Michael O\u2019Hanlon, a senior fellow in foreign policy at the Brookings Institution.\n\n\n\nRyan\u2019s evidence\nRyan\u2019s staff noted to us that PolitiFact Texas in July 2016 checked a similar but much more involved claim made by then-presidential candidate Donald Trump.\nOur colleagues found that Air Force maintenance workers pull parts from warehoused planes at the Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson, Ariz. -- a practice that goes back decades because it saves money and keeps the Air Force from waiting longer for new parts to be made.\nBut that fact check didn\u2019t get to whether the Air Force takes what seems like a more desperate step of sending parts hunters to museums.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe only example Ryan\u2019s office cited was a May 2016 Fox News article in which an Air Force captain said spare parts needed for a B-1 bomber at a base in South Dakota were taken from seven \"museum aircraft\" from around the country, including the South Dakota Air and Space Museum.\u00a0\nSo, Ryan\u2019s evidence is pretty thin: An isolated example to back a broad claim.\nExpert views\nConversely, more than a half dozen experts confirmed to us that it has been common for decades to retrieve parts in military airplane \"boneyards.\" Indeed, that is one of the main purposes for collecting and preserving older planes at such sites.\nDavis-Monthan, according to AirplaneBoneyards.com, is the largest aircraft boneyard in the world. Known officially as the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group, the boneyard has more than 4,400 aircraft from the Air Force, other military branches and other federal agencies, according to the base. Besides storing aircraft that can be tapped for parts, the base also restores planes to put them back into operation.\nThe boneyard also offers tours. But that hardly makes it a museum.\nAs for Ryan\u2019s slap at the Obama administration\u2019s military spending, PolitiFact National found in December 2015 that the spending did drop during Obama\u2019s tenure.\nBut O\u2019Hanlon, Todd Harrison at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Laicie Heeley at the Stimson Center and other defense experts agreed that lack of funds has not been a problem in terms of the Air Force finding spare parts.\nOur rating\nSaying the military was plunged into a readiness crisis under Obama, Ryan claimed: \"We got to a point that our Air Force pilots were going to museums to find spare parts over the last eight years.\"\nIt is a broad claim, but his office cited only one news article that quoted an Air Force captain as saying parts for seven planes were obtained from \"museum aircraft.\"\nMeanwhile, defense experts told us that Ryan\u2019s claim was highly misleading, in that any such museum scrounging, if it has ever occurred, is isolated. Indeed, the Air Force operates a base whose main functions include storing thousands of planes to be available for spare parts.\nThe experts also agreed that even as defense spending dropped under Obama, the Air Force had sufficient funding to prevent the need for pilots to hunt for airplane parts in museums.\nWe rate Ryan\u2019s claim Pants on Fire.\nEditor's note: This item was updated on June 9, 2017 to say\u00a0that the Fox News report did identify one museum.\u00a0That information does not change the rating.\n Share the Facts 2017-05-11 14:22:57 UTC   Politifact    6 1 7  Politifact Rating: Pants on Fire  \"We got to a point that our Air Force pilots were going to museums to find spare parts over the last eight years\" under Barack Obama.
