He said he was getting results. In an interview published in the Miami Herald on 20 May, Wilcox blamed the White House for restricting the country &apos; s ability to obtain intelligence from alleged terrorists. \"I can tell you that the enhanced interrogation techniques that have since been banned by this administration - specifically drowning - are working,\" said Wilcox, who competes for Republican candidacy to replace S. Marco Rubio. \"They are working on terrorists, and there is a firm history of that.\" Wilcox did not consider this practice to be torture, and he also said that while he did not advocate the excessive use of water drowning, it was an option that should be available to interrogators. We wanted to know whether drowning in the water tied the prisoner to a painting or table and then poured water on a cloth that covered his mouth and nose to simulate drowning, a proven way of interrogating someone. Torture against interrogation was one of the \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" used by American investigators against terrorist suspects in the years following the September 11 attacks. This practice was prohibited by an executive order in 2009 by President Barack Obama. He was recently revived in politics after Donald Trump called on the Democratic Party candidate to drown in water and \"worst\" if he was elected. Wilcox, Orlando Defense Contractor, noted to Poletti Fact Florida through her spokesperson that some senior officials, including former Vice-President Dick Cheney, former Defence Minister Donald Rumsfeld, and former CIA Director Leon Banita, had been involved in the work of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. He told the former CIA officer Green Berrett that he had \"access to a lot of information that the rest of the audience may not know\" from which to draw his conclusion. However, Poletti Fruitke cannot make a judgement based on classified information or is not readily available to the public, so we do not consider this assertion to be evidence. Wilcox did not provide further details on his assertion that there was evidence that drowning in water had been successful. But those declarations lack real evidence, both historically and in the recent past, that experts have told us. Professor Darius Regali, Professor of Political Science at Reid College, said that drowning in water had long been a weak means of extracting information. Only a few case studies on the effects of water drowning are available. These examples included Nazi German Gestapo in Norway and France; French in Vietnam and Algeria; and the United States in the Philippines at the beginning of the last century. In each case, the benefits of drowning in water were at best suspicious, as my men said. At first, the interrogators can't know if the prisoner is revealing anything realistic. They think they have training and can say what's right, but they can't. In the meantime, the prisoner is probably willing to say anything to make the interrogation stop. On January 22, 2021, Jeremy \"Spike\" Cohen mentioned an article on Facebook in which the Paiden administration said that she was a liberal terrorist. \u2022 On 22 January 2021, one of the most notable examples of the alleged success of the drowning was the success of Abu Zubedeh, who was initially identified by the Bush administration as the Chief of Operations of the Base. Zebedeh was drowned 83 times, among other techniques, and the planned attacks on shopping centres, nuclear power plants and the Brooklyn Bridge were acknowledged. However, Zebeda was mentally ill and was in fact responsible for scheduling people to move to and from Al-Qaida training camps after joining the group in the aftermath of the events of 11 September. Most of the information he provided was unreliable, but it was also provided before he drowned in water. He revealed a lot, as critics say, because he didn't know a lot of real details. The Senate Select Committee for Intelligence examined the CIA program when Democrats controlled the Senate. Their final report, which is approximately 6,700 pages long and approved in 2012, is still classified. A revised 525-page executive summary was issued in December 2014, followed by a report on Republican minorities in the Commission from the Central Intelligence Agency. The summary stated that enhanced interrogation techniques such as water drowning were not effective in obtaining intelligence from persons detained after the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001. The Commission examined 20 outstanding cases (including the case of Zubedeh) that were said to have \"save lives,\" according to the CIA and the Bush administration. Some of these cases specifically cited water drowning as a tactic used, but the Committee concluded that in each example, either the main information had been collected before the enhanced interrogation began, or that the information was already available prior to the interrogation, or that the interrogation had nothing to do with the information obtained. Regali pointed out that most of the officials defending drowning were persons whose jobs were at risk because of the practice. Patrick Eddington, a former CIA analyst now at the Liberal Cato Institute, said the Senate investigation showed that the agency was aware of water drowning and other techniques that could be considered torture. \"SSTI report makes it very clear, through the publication of CIA documents, that CIA personnel, including Director John Tenny, There's a little empirical data on drowning, because, as you might imagine, there's a variety of reasons why people don't usually line up to submit to simulate drowning. One of the topics in a BBC documentary admitted that he was a \"bunny boy\" only seconds later, not to mention it. But Shane Umara, a professor of experimental brain research at Trinity College, told NewZwick that there is scientific evidence that drowning in water physically prevents a person from providing reliable information. The suffocation stimulates survival instincts, not memory memory, and Omara told the magazine. Moreover, the lack of oxygen (hoxya) is detrimental to perception and the increase in carbon dioxide (hoxya) causes panic. In fact, putting a person under intense pressure to speak makes it difficult for him to remember or report anything worth extracting. Regali noted that there was a third element to be considered, along with historical and scientific strikes against water drowning. Honestly, while much of the Senate report remains confidential, there is no evidence that the CIA drowning programme has been effective enough to convince the most brutal systems to use it. \"If the Americans have found gold wool from torture techniques, no one has noticed and no one is copying,\" said Regali. The most common way to get someone to talk is still to be electrocuted or beaten with sticks, as he said, although these techniques still do not guarantee anything that is said to lead to practical intelligence. If drowning is really considered effective, for example, \"thousands of torturers in China will use this. But they don't do it.\" The Governor Wilcox said, \"I can tell you that the enhanced interrogation techniques that have since been banned by this administration - specifically drowning - are working.\" While many senior officials have defended the use of the CIA for drowning in the past, there is no conclusive evidence that this practice provides results. Experts said that there were few historical accounts of success, and even these were suspicious. At the same time, there is scientific evidence that a technique such as water drowning will affect the function of the brain enough to make any prisoner's statements unreliable. They may say anything to make drowning stop, and it can actually be physically incapable of providing any convincing intelligence. Wilcox did not provide concrete evidence and experts say that there is almost no. We're assessing the statement wrong.
