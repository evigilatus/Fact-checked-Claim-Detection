Bernie Sanders about a few controversies surrounding his staff during the Feb. 4, 2016, New Hampshire presidential debate.\nOne that had emerged in the previous 24 hours concerned an ad Sanders\u2019 campaign had run in advance of the New Hampshire primary.\nMaddow asked Sanders about the Nashua Telegraph complaining recently \"that you falsely implied in an advertisement that they had endorsed you when they did not.\"\nSanders responded, \"We did not suggest that we had the endorsement of a newspaper. Newspapers who make endorsements also say positive things about other candidates, and to the best of my knowledge, that is what we did. So we never said, never said that somebody, a newspaper endorsed us that did not. What we did say is blah blah blah blah was said by the newspaper.\"\nMaddow then said, \"Just to follow up on that, the title of the ad in question was \u2018Endorsement.\u2019 \"\nSanders responded, \"But that was only for -- that was not to be on television. That's an important point. That was just something -- as the secretary knows, you put titles on ads and you send them out, but there was no word in that ad, none, that said that those newspapers had endorsed us.\"\nAs it happens, Maddow had referred specifically to one of two newspapers cited in the ad, and her choice might have allowed Sanders an out -- the ad in question did not explicitly say the Telegraph had endorsed him.\nBut in his answer, Sanders broadened his response to include \"those newspapers,\" which is a problem because the initial version of the ad did explicitly include\u00a0text that said the Valley News had endorsed him when it had not. This version was later tweaked for subsequent use.\nThe ad was first posted online Wednesday, Feb. 3 and touts endorsements from unions, an environmental group and The Nation magazine.\n\"From postal workers to nurses, he\u2019s been endorsed for real change,\" a narrator says in the ad.\nThe narrator goes on to quote editorials from two New Hampshire newspapers, The Telegraph, of Nashua, and the Valley News, which covers both Vermont and New Hampshire from West Lebanon, N.H.\nUp to that point in the 30-second ad, every logo for an organization or publication has been accompanied by the words \"endorsed by.\" Those words disappear when the Telegraph\u2019s logo appears, along with the quote: \"He\u2019s not beholden to Wall Street Money.\"\nThe words \"endorsed by\" then reappear next to the logo of the Valley News, which appears along with the quote: \"Sanders has been genuinely outraged about the treatment of ordinary Americans for as long as we can remember.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.

It removed the word \"endorsed\" by the Valley News logo, although it left the quotes from both New Hampshire newspapers untouched. That\u2019s the version of the ad that was on the campaign\u2019s official YouTube channel immediately before the debate, and the ad is still titled \"Endorsed.\"\nAfter the debate, Sanders spokesman Warren Gunnels told PolitiFact that the\u00a0incorrect version of the ad\u00a0never aired on\u00a0television.\n\"A\u00a0YouTube version of this ad mistakenly used this word, but it was never aired on television. As soon as we discovered this mistake it was taken down,\" Gunnels said.\nHowever, during the debate Sanders didn't draw a distinction between the campaign buying air time on TV and posting a publicly viewable ad on the Internet.\u00a0\nThe Valley News editorial quoted in the ad \u2013 from Dec. 31, 2014 --\u00a0encouraged Sanders to enter the presidential race. \"A presidential candidate who vigorously espoused populism from a progressive point of view could help restore much-needed balance to American political life, which has tilted sharply to the right in recent decades,\" the paper wrote.\nHowever, it was published far too early in the campaign cycle to be considered an endorsement.\nOur ruling\nIn the debate, Sanders said one of his campaign ads \"never said ... a newspaper endorsed us that did not.\"\nSanders is glossing over the initial version of his campaign ad. It originally included\u00a0text that said Sanders had been \"endorsed\" by the Valley News, a word that was later removed after it became clear that the newspaper had made no such endorsement.\nWe rate Sanders\u2019 claim in the debate False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05461"}
