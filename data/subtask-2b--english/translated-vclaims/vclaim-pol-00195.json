That's the range.", "text": "At first glance, trade tensions between the United States and China may seem unrelated to the surge of forest fires in the Amazon rainforest. But one of the democratic presidential candidates links environmental devastation to President Donald Trump's commercial war with Beijing. The argument of John Delaney is that tariffs imposed on major economic powers have eliminated United States exports of soybeans to China. As a result, farmers in Latin America are now stimulating extreme measures to feed their newly expanded Chinese market. \"In fact, the Amazon forest fires are directly related to trade. The fact that United States farmers cannot sell soybean to China has created an opportunity for Brazil to sell soybean to China.\" John Delaney, August 27, said on Fox News. \"As a result, farmers are tearing down the Amazon to grow soybeans.\" We found that while these two points - the United States-China trade war and the Amazon forest fires - can be linked, Delaney has overreacted. The Amazon fire experts studying old environments say that farmers were burning the Amazon rainforests for Melanya. Why did this year's fires attract so much attention? Because there has not been such a large number of fires since 2012. More than 95,000 fires have erupted in the Brazilian Amazon at its last census, an increase of 59 per cent over this time last year, according to the Brazilian National Space Research Institute. The number changes daily. Although this year is not on track to break the record, the amount of fire is \"relatively high compared to recent years,\" written by Michaela Weiss and Sarah Ruiz of the World Resources Institute. Environmental experts believe that humans are responsible for the vast majority of these forest fires, and China resorts intentionally or not to Brazil. What does this have to do with commercial relations between the United States and China? According to Delaney's logic, the Trump trade war with China began with reprisals against soybean farmers in the United States. Increasingly, Chinese soybean buyers looked at farmers in Brazil, where Amazon lands could be used to grow crops - even if it meant burning rain forests to remove more arable land. United States The Soybean Export Council, a trade association, expects that this year &apos; s US soybean exports to China will be about one third of last year. At the same time, Brazil replaced the United States as the largest soybean supplier, according to South China Morning Post. While Brazil has been selling soybean to China for years, the trade war between the United States and China has been a welcome development for soybean farmers in Brazil. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" By Samantha Buterman: January 11, 2021 \"We are willing to take advantage of the trade war to increase our trade with China and continue to build trade relations,\" said Igor Brandao, Head of the Agribusiness Department of the Brazil Trade Promotion Agency, South China Morning Post. We have approached experts from a variety of fields - economics, trade, politics and environmental science - and they have stated that only any factor is responsible for the rise in forest fires in the Amazon region this year. While the trade war between the United States and China is certainly one of the factors, it should not be given the greatest weight, some experts have told us that. The most immediate reason lies in the decisions taken by political and business leaders in Brazil. Farmers and farmers in South America have long sought more Amazon lands to raise livestock and grow crops. In countries where the Amazon region is located - Paraguay, Brazil, Bolivia and Peru - there are laws against deforestation, but enforcement has been inconsistent. While former Brazilian Presidents exercised relatively tighter control over rainforests, the administration of President J\u00e9r\u00e9 Paulonaro, who took office at the beginning of 2019, took a more effective approach to promoting greater agricultural activity and development. Some of the experts with whom we spoke said that this was the real spark - not the tense trade relations between the United States and China. Gary Hoffmann, a colleague at the Peterson Institute of International Economics, which supports free trade, said: \"The main economic cause of the fires is the pent-up demand - under the supervision of the former Brazilian Presidents - for new livestock and crop areas.\" The Bolsonaro government has subsided control and the fire has escalated. While denouncing the Trump trade war, he said, \"I think the tie to the Amazon fires is far away.\" A national geographic analysis of data from the Global Fire Emissions Database also concluded that the high level of fire was the result of the lenient Pulnaro management systems. \"In Brazil - which controls the majority of the vast forests - regulations have been in place for more than a decade to curb the expansion of deforestation,\" reported National Geographic. \"But these rules have been relaxed by the new Brazilian administration, and therefore the fires are escalating.\" The Delaney campaign referred to a number of press reports that linked the Trump trade war with China to the burning Amazon rainforest. The trade war waged by the Trump Administration with China \"has provided some economic incentives for the clearing of the Amazon forests by fire,\" said Ross Burkhart, a professor of political science at the Boizi State University specializing in environmental policy. However, any connection was indirect, and to some extent far from the main point. \"The focus on that effect takes away from the more direct causal factors,\" he said, \"which, in my view, involves internal decisions taken by Brazilian leaders, agriculture, business, and political leaders.\" Our government, Delaney, has said that the Amazon rainforest fires are \"directly related to trade\" to the tensions between the United States and China. Trade tensions between the United States and China have expanded opportunities for South American farmers to sell soybeans in China, which in turn has created an economic incentive to burn Amazon lands so that they can be used for crop production. However, the most immediate reason for the escalation of forest fires is the easing of the rules of deforestation under the current Brazilian Government, which favours the agricultural and commercial interests of the country.
