Bernie Sanders was intended to show that he, not former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, was the best friend of undocumented immigrants. Saunders said that in Vermont, government driving licences were supported for undocumented migrants. In New York, Clinton was opposed. Sanders referred to the period 2014 of tens of thousands of unaccompanied minors across the border. \"One of the great human tragedies of recent years has come from Honduras where there is more violence than anywhere in this country, \"I said, \"Welcome to these children in this country. Minister Clinton said, send them back.\" Clinton said that this is not a fair summary. The Sanders campaign said that they got their information from an interview by Clinton with Christian Amanpour on CNN in June 2014. We looked at the full exchange of views on what the United States should do with children. Amanpur: \"Do they have to be able to stay here? It's safer.\" Clinton: \"Well -- it may be safer, but that's not the answer. I don't-- \"Amanpur: \"Does it have to be returned?\" Clinton: \"Well, first of all, we have to provide the best emergency care we can. We have children at the age of five and six who came from Central America. We need to do more to provide border security in southern Mexico.\" Amanpur: \"So, you're saying they should be returned now?\" The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 January 11, 2021 Clinton: \"Well, they should be returned as soon as it is possible to identify the responsible adults in their families, because there are concerns about whether they should all be returned. But I believe that everyone who can be reunited with their families.\" Clinton made two points in that last answer. It's not as simple as saying \"send them again,\" but this was certainly the result of her support in some cases. Specifically, she said that they should be returned if the Government could identify responsible adults for their care. She allowed that it might not be possible to send them all home. However, she referred to a preference. \"I believe that all those who can be reunited with their families,\" said Clinton. It should be noted that at that time the Department actively pursued a policy of discouraging children and adolescents in Central America from trying to take this journey in the first place. The Government had open letters printed in the local newspapers and paid for the propaganda that dispelled any myth that these young people would be allowed to stay if they were able to cross the border. In July 2014, the White House indicated that it would seek funds to accelerate the return of most of the children who had been stopped at the United States border. We sought a comment from the Clinton campaign and did not respond to it at the time we were deployed. Our judge Saunders said that when undocumented children were flowing across the border, Clinton said, bring them back. That's a little too simple. Clinton did not say that they should be returned no matter what. I've made the condition that the government must first identify responsible adults to take care of them. However, she expressed a preference for returning as many of those communications as possible. This message was part of the Department &apos; s policy to discourage more young people from trying to take this trip. We're mostly assessing this statement right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05293"}
