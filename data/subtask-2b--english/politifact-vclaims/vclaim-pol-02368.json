Now it's $60. That\u2019s $40 you have in your pocket \u2014 every American that would fill up at a pump station \u2014 that you wouldn\u2019t have.\" (The comment is around the 7:20 mark in this C-SPAN video.)\nHave gas prices fallen?\nIt\u2019s possible to come up with a 40 percent decline \u2014 but the decline came under President Barack Obama, not President Donald Trump.\nAccording to the federal Energy Information Administration, the peak gasoline price under Obama was $3.96 a gallon in mid May 2011. The low price under Trump was $2.33 \u2014 the week he was inaugurated in 2017.\nThat\u2019s a 40 percent decline, but the drop came entirely on Obama\u2019s watch.\nFor the final two and a half years of Obama\u2019s tenure, the average gallon of gas went no higher than $3.50. It hit a low of $1.73 in February 2016, lower than at any point in the Trump presidency.\nUnder Trump, the price at the pump has trended upward. From $2.33 at Trump\u2019s inauguration, it rose to $2.56 in mid February 2018. That\u2019s an increase of almost 10 percent.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s the full data for gasoline prices under Obama and Trump:\n\nDid Trump\u2019s pro-resource development policies make a difference?\nProbably not on gasoline prices so far, experts say.\nMost of the ramp-up in oil production that benefited consumer prices occurred during what critics have derided as Obama's \"war on fossil fuels,\" said Severin Borenstein, a professor of business administration and public policy at the University of California-Berkeley's Haas School of Business.\nHe added that Trump policies on drilling may make a difference going forward. \"To the extent that looser environmental regulations allow greater oil production in the future, that will increase downward pressure on oil prices, and gasoline prices,\" Borenstein said.\nStill, the future price drops from Trump policies may not be massive. \"Increased oil production in the United States has put some downward pressure on crude prices, though that is hardly the only factor in the decline of gasoline prices,\" he said.\nThe Interior Department did not get back to us.\nOur ruling\nZinke said, \"Under the previous administration it was \u2026 $100\u00a0to fill a car. American energy has delivered. Now it's $60. That\u2019s $40 you have in your pocket \u2026 that you wouldn\u2019t have.\"\nThe only 40 percent drop in the recent data occurred on Obama\u2019s watch, meaning that Trump\u2019s policies couldn\u2019t have influenced it. On Trump\u2019s watch, the price of gasoline has actually risen by 10 percent.\nWe rate the statement False.\n Share the Facts 2018-02-26 22:48:06 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  \"Under the previous administration it was \u2026 $100 to fill a car.
