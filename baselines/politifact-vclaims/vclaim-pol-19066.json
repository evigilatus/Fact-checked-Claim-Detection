The shirt reads: \"Koolest Kid in the Klan.\" Most of the text is white and black while each of the three Ks is red so that \"KKK\" pops out.\nThe sweatshirt appears to sell for $24.99. But the ad, which is being shared on Facebook, isn\u2019t authentic.\u00a0\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nWe found no evidence that H&M ever sold such an item, and if it did, it would be widely covered in the press \u2014\u00a0especially since the company came under intense scrutiny in 2018 for using a Black child to model a sweatshirt that said \"Coolest Monkey in the Jungle.\" That year, H&M had to temporarily close several stores in South Africa after people protested the sweatshirt as racist.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe image in this Facebook post appears to be in response to the monkey sweatshirt. It started appearing on Reddit and meme websites in 2018.\u00a0\nDoing a reverse image search of the boy in the KKK sweatshirt, we found what looks like the original image. In this version, though, the front of the sweatshirt is blank.\u00a0\nH&M didn\u2019t respond to PolitiFact\u2019s query about the Facebook post, but Lead Stories reported that a spokesperson told the fact-checking website that the photo is fake.\nWe rate this image False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19066"}
