Like 300,000 North Dakotans, Denise has a pre-existing condition. That used to mean no health insurance. For me it\u2019s breast cancer, for Denise it\u2019s heart disease.\"\n\"She has something she\u2019d like to say to Kevin Cramer. \u2018Mr Cramer, I don\u2019t know why you voted to let insurance companies go back to denying coverage for pre-existing conditions. But I know Heidi would never do that.\u2019 \"\nHeitkamp is talking about several votes Cramer cast in 2013 and again in 2016 to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Let\u2019s take a look at what they did.\nKey takeaways\n\u2022 300,000 includes everyone with some sort of pre-existing condition. The people whose health plans might be at risk is a fraction of that.\n\u2022 Cramer cast votes\u00a0to both repeal Obamacare and replace it with skimpier plans.\n\u2022 While these replacements kept protections for pre-existing conditions in place, they\u00a0stripped some of the safeguards that make those plans affordable today.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCramer and\u00a0the Affordable Care Act\nThe Affordable Care Act made sure that people without health insurance got coverage. The problematic sector was the individual, or non-group, market: those not covered by their employer or by the government. They form the smallest part of the market.\nBefore the Affordable Care Act, people in that market could get turned down for having a pre-existing condition (anything from hay fever to cancer); could get charged more for it; or could be offered a health plan that excluded its coverage. Now, all of those things are illegal.\nThe Heitkamp campaign said there are 300,000 individuals with pre-existing conditions in North Dakota, rounding the 275,556 calculated by Health and Human Services in 2009 and 316,000 calculated by the Center for American Progress.\nThose numbers are credible, but the majority of those individuals are covered by group plans. So voting to repeal the Affordable Care Act is not a vote to strip coverage from all 300,000. Instead, it\u00a0would jeopardize coverage for the non-group market, which covered 9 percent of North Dakotans in 2016. The ad does not make clear whether Denise is in the group or individual market.\nHeitkamp sent us Cramer's votes to strip funding for the Affordable Care Act and one vote to repeal it. Cramer\u2019s campaign told us he has always supported coverage of pre-existing conditions, pointing to the American Health Care Act and Graham-Cassidy.\nWhatever Cramer\u2019s wish is, his votes jeopardize coverage as it stands for pre-existing conditions in the individual market, according to Karen Pollitz, senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit health care organization.\nBy the letter of the law the bills protect pre-existing conditions. But they take away the mandate that everyone be insured and the subsidies that make that affordable. In practice, plans for individuals in the nongroup market would become exorbitantly priced, if available at all.\nOur ruling\nHeitkamp said Cramer voted to let insurance companies go back to denying coverage for 300,000 North Dakotans with pre-existing conditions.\nCramer's votes technically included provisions to prevent health care companies from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions.\u00a0But the limits of what insurance companies could charge would have been watered down, which would have sent premiums skyrocketing, experts say, to the point that coverage for many would be unattainable. However, only about a tenth of the 300,000 people in the ad would be directly affected by the laws in question.\nWe rate this statement Half True.\n Share the Facts 2018-08-24 16:17:27 UTC   PolitiFact    4 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Half True  Says Kevin Cramer voted to let insurance companies go back to denying coverage for 300,000 North Dakotans with pre-existing conditions.
