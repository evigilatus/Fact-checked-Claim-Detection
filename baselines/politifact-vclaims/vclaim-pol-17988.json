It\u2019s the pathway to better understanding how far the disease has spread, how common severe cases are and how best to address it.\nSo is the president pushing to limit testing?\nA new attack ad from Priorities USA targeting Wisconsin and other battleground states makes that claim with a series of quotes from President Donald Trump. Over the mandatory ominous music, the ad plays four Trump quotes asserting testing is making America look bad, so we should slow it down.\n\n\n\n\nAds in this style have been known to pull quotes out of context or rearrange them chronologically to create a more compelling narrative.\nThat didn\u2019t happen here.\nAmerica has the most confirmed coronavirus cases in the world \u2014 with 2.3 million as of June 24, 2020 \u2014 and has also done the most testing in the world, in terms of raw numbers. Across the nation we are conducting about 500,000 tests per day now, double where we were in early May, according to covidtracking.com.\nThat said, many countries have done more testing on a per-capita basis, as detailed by Johns Hopkins University. Throughout the pandemic the U.S. has averaged about 56 tests per day per 100,000 people. Germany, Canada, Spain and Australia have all tested at a higher rate, and Russia and Qatar are among a handful of countries that have topped 100 daily tests per 100,000 people.\nTrump has boasted of the volume of testing in the past, saying America\u2019s testing is the best in the world and that the high number of confirmed cases is a \"badge of honor.\"\nBut since May, the president has also increasingly pushed back against testing, calling it \"overrated\" and noting the bad optics associated with the higher case counts. He took that line of reasoning a step farther in his latest comments, as detailed in the ad.\nHere are the four quotes in context.\n\u2018By doing all of this testing we make ourselves look bad.\u2019\nTrump said this May 6, 2020, during a meeting with Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds.\nThe quote\n\"The media likes to say we have the most cases, but we do, by far, the most testing.\u00a0 If we did very little testing, we wouldn\u2019t have the most cases. So, in a way, by doing all of this testing, we make ourselves look bad.\"\nThe context\nReynolds \u2014 a Republican \u2014 responded to Trump by highlighting the importance of testing: \"That really provides us the data we need to understand the virus activity better.\" Trump, meanwhile, has made numerous similar comments, including a June 19, 2020, Wall Street Journal interview where he called testing \"overrated\" and said \"in many ways, it makes us look bad.\"\n\u2018When you test you find something is wrong.\u2019\nTrump said this May 14, 2020, during an appearance in Pennsylvania.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe quote\n\"Don\u2019t forget, we have more cases than anyone in the world, but why? Because we do more testing. When you test, you have a case. When you test, you find something is wrong with people. If we didn\u2019t do any testing, we would have very few cases.\"\nThe context\nTrump asserts there would be fewer cases if there were less testing. Of course, less testing would simply mean officials are aware of less cases, or there would be fewer identified cases \u2014 it wouldn\u2019t mean fewer cases exist.\u00a0\nBut this line of thinking is consistent with other comments from the president, including a May 15, 2020, event where Trump said, \"If we didn't do any testing, we would have very few cases,\" and \"Maybe it (testing) is overrated.\"\n\"Testing is a double-edged sword. \u2026 So I said to my people, slow the testing down please.\"\nThese statements, used separately in the ad, are both from a June 20, 2020, rally in Oklahoma.\nThe quote\n\"You know, testing is a double-edged sword. We\u2019ve tested now 25 million people. It\u2019s probably 20 million people more than anybody else. German\u2019s done a lot. South Korea\u2019s done a lot. They called me, they said the job you\u2019re doing (trails off). Here\u2019s the bad part. When you\u2019re testing to that extent, you\u2019re going to find more people, you\u2019re going to find more cases. So I said to my people, \u2018Slow the testing down, please.\u2019\"\n(Note: The U.S. has conducted more tests than any other country in terms of raw numbers, but the \"20 million \u2026 more than anybody else\" is wrong. Russia has conducted more than 17 million tests, according to tallies from Our World in Data)\nThe context\nVarious White House officials claimed Trump was speaking in \"jest\", was \"obviously kidding\" or was speaking \"tongue in cheek\" about slowing down testing. Trump himself has responded to this assertion multiple ways.\nOn June 23, 2020, he was asked specifically if he was kidding about slowing down testing. He responded, \"I don\u2019t kid. Let me just tell you. Let me make it clear,\" then went on to talk about America having \"the greatest testing program anywhere.\"\nBut in an interview that day with FOX News, Trump responded to a question\u00a0 \u2014 \"But you don\u2019t mean, do you mean slow down testing?\"\u00a0 \u2014\u00a0 by backing away from the statement and reiterating the idea that the U.S. would look better if it tested less.\u00a0\n\"No I don\u2019t mean slow down, but if we did slow down \u2026 let\u2019s say instead of 25 million tests we did 5 million tests, we\u2019d be very low in cases right now, and everyone would say, \u2018Isn\u2019t that wonderful,\u2019\" Trump told \"Fox & Friends.\"\nDr. Anthony Fauci \u2014 part of the national coronavirus task force \u2014 said that day in testimony before Congress the federal government is trying to expand coronavirus testing, not slow it down. Fauci told the House Energy and Commerce Committee, \"None of us have ever been told to slow down on testing.\"\nOur ruling\nAn attack ad targeting various battleground states quotes Trump as saying testing makes the U.S. look bad, \"so I said to my people slow the testing down.\"\nVideo recordings show he did indeed say these lines, and in the order presented. And the overall impression created by the ad is consistent with Trump\u2019s messaging over the preceding month and a half.\nAs health officials and politicians alike have pushed for more testing, Trump has expressed increasing doubts as to its importance, progressing from calling it \"overrated\" to calling for the slow down. Though White House officials defended that as a joke, Trump at one point contradicted that, while at another saying he didn\u2019t mean it.\nWe rate this claim True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17988"}
