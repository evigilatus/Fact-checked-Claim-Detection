We found that Ukrainian Jews are not being forced to register.\nThe story seems to have originated in Donetsk, a region and a city in eastern Ukraine. On April 7, pro-Russian activists took control of Donetsk\u2019s government building. Almost two weeks later, USA Today reported, \"Leaflet tells Jews to register in East Ukraine.\"\nCiting an Israeli news article, USA Today reported that Jews emerging from a synagogue in Donetsk on April 14 were handed pamphlets asking them to \"register\" with pro-Russian militants. If Jewish adults refused to register and pay a $50 fee, they\u2019d be forced out of the country.\nOn the same day the story appeared, Kerry mentioned the notice in his speech. We reached out to Kerry's office for evidence, but they pointed us back to his remarks.\nAlmost immediately, there were signs that the fliers weren\u2019t really coming from any kind of authority.\nThe separatist whose signature allegedly appears on the flier -- Donetsk People\u2019s Republic Chairman Denis Pushilin, leader of the pro-Russian militants -- denied any connection to it.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReporters on the ground quickly found that no one was actually being registered.\nPolitiFact exchanged emails with Ari Shapiro, an NPR international correspondent reporting from Donetsk, who said there is a real flier, but it went ignored until the media caught on. Shapiro himself went after the story\u00a0and shared his reporting with us.\n\"You walk down the street with a beard and kippah,\" said Yaguda Kellerman, deputy chief of the Donetsk Jewish Community Center, to Shapiro. \"And you never experience any problems here. I was born in Donetsk.\"\nDonetsk chief rabbi Pinchas Vishedski acknowledged the flier\u2019s existence, but called it a provocation, Shapiro reported. U.S. media outlets like Vox and the New Republic have also questioned its validity. A New York Times report from Donetsk said that militants never intended to set up a registry, and the room designated for registering Jews sat empty Thursday.\nBoth sides -- pro-Ukrainian and pro-Russian -- have accused each other of anti-Semitism during this conflict.\nAn April 15 United Nations report noted that the Association of Jewish Organisations and Communities of Ukraine has said incidents are isolated and that Jewish people, generally speaking, don\u2019t feel threatened by Ukrainian leaders.\nThe pro-Russia rebels have since put out their own flier attacking the original anti-Semitism accusations, Shapiro reported.\nOur ruling\nKerry said Ukrainian Jews are being asked to register. There was a flier, but it doesn\u2019t seem to have been issued by any authority. No one knows yet who distributed them, but the separatist movement denies issuing the fliers. Jewish community leaders in the area have denounced the pamphlets\u2019 legitimacy. Reporters on the ground in Donetsk say that the fliers aren\u2019t being taken seriously, and no Jews are registering.\nKerry\u2019s comments included none of that context. It\u2019s possible Kerry\u2019s comments were drawn from what he considered to be legitimate news reports, but those earlier reports didn\u2019t include the full picture of what was going on. Anyone listening to Kerry\u2019s remarks would think that the requests were coming from some sort of authority on the ground that had the means to enforce its request, and that\u2019s not the case. Kerry\u2019s remarks did not accurately convey the situation on the ground in Ukraine. For these reasons, we rate his statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07973"}
