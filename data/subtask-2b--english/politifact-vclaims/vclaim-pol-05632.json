Debbie Wasserman Schultz bashed several GOP candidates, most notably fellow Floridian U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, in a Dec. 9 interview on CNN.\n\"It's not just Donald Trump that has said that Muslims are unacceptable for admission to this country,\" said Wasserman Schultz, highlighting comments about refugees by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie before turning to Rubio.\n\"Marco Rubio after the Paris attacks said not only that we should be considering internment, he actually suggested that maybe we should close down cafes and diners where Muslims gather, and in fact, compared them to the Nazi party,\" Wasserman Schultz said.\nDid Rubio actually say those things about Muslims?\nOur research shows Wasserman Schultz distorted Rubio\u2019s recent TV interviews. We will explain each portion of her statement and why it creates an inaccurate picture of Rubio\u2019s comments.\nRubio has not called for internment of Muslims \nEven the DNC admitted the \"internment\" part of her attack on Rubio is completely inaccurate.\nRubio has not proposed anything similar to the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II for Muslims.\nDNC spokesman Sean Bartlett claimed Wasserman Schultz had comments by Trump in mind during this part of her interview.\nIn December, Trump told TIME magazine he wasn\u2019t certain if he would have supported internment of Japanese during World War ll.\n\"I would have had to be there at the time to tell you, to give you a proper answer,\" he said. \"I certainly hate the concept of it. But I would have had to be there at the time to give you a proper answer.\"\nTrump told Morning Joe on Dec. 8 that he wasn\u2019t proposing internment camps for Muslims. But in an interview on Good Morning America, he compared himself to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who ordered the Japanese internment.\n\"What I'm doing is no different than FDR,\" Trump said. \"I mean, take a look at what FDR did many years ago and he's one of the most highly respected presidents. I mean respected by most people. They named highways after him,\" he said, referencing a highway in New York City named for the former president.\nWhen asked if he supports internment camps, Trump said no.\nThese comments by Trump, however, don\u2019t add validity to what Wasserman Schultz said about Rubio.\nRubio on Muslim cafes and diners \nAccording to Wasserman Schultz, Rubio \"actually suggested that maybe we should close down cafes and diners where Muslims gather.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRubio did talk about closing down cafes in an interview Nov. 19 with Fox News\u2019 Megyn Kelly, but Wasserman Schultz fails to mention a key qualifier. Rubio said any place should be closed down if it is a site \"where radicals are being inspired.\"\nIn the interview, Kelly asked Rubio, \"Donald Trump is suggesting we may need to close mosques that have problems with radicals at the top. What do you say?\"\nRubio replied, \"Well, I think we need to target radicalism. A lot of it is actually happening online, not simply in mosques. The vast majority of the mosques in America is not...\"\nKelly asked: \"But the mosques piece is a controversial piece, so where do you stand on that?\"\nRubio then said:\n\"Well, I think it's not about closing down mosques. It's about closing down any place. Whether it's a cafe, a diner, an internet spot. Any place where radicals are being inspired.\n\"And that we have \u2014 the biggest problem we have is our inability to find out what these places are because we've crippled our intelligence programs, both through an authorized disclosure by a traitor, in other words, [Edward] Snowden, or by some of the things that this president has put in place for the support even of some from my own party to diminish our intelligence capabilities.\n\"So, whatever facilities being used, it's not just a mosques. Any facility that's being used to radicalize and inspire attacks against the United States should be a place that we look at.\"\nClosing down any place if it is being used to \"inspire attacks\" is different from flat-out calling for shuttering cafes and diners simply because Muslims gather there.\nNazi comparison \nThe last part of Wasserman Schultz\u2019s attack is that Rubio compared Muslims \"to the Nazi party.\"\nThis is also a case of Wasserman Schultz twisting Rubio\u2019s words out of context.\nBartlett of the DNC pointed to Rubio\u2019s interview with George Stephanopoulos on ABC\u2019s This Week Nov. 15, the night after a Democratic debate. Stephanopoulos asked Rubio: \"You saw Secretary Clinton there did not want to use the words \u2018radical Islam.\u2019 What is your response?\"\nRubio replied, \"I don\u2019t understand it. That would be like saying we weren\u2019t at war with Nazis because we were afraid to offend some Germans who may have been members of the Nazi party but weren\u2019t violent themselves. We are at war with radical Islam, with an interpretation of Islam by a significant number of people around the world, who they believe now justifies them in killing those who don't agree with their ideology. This is a clash of civilizations. ... Of course all Muslims are not members of violent jihadist groups.\"\nRubio was trying to use an analogy to suggest it would have been ridiculous to avoid using the word \"Nazis\" during World War II out of fear of offending some Germans who were members of the Nazi party.\nWe emailed a spokesman for Rubio to ask if he had addressed this comparison again but did not hear back, and a Nexis search did not turn up other examples of him talking about this.\nOur ruling\nAccording to Wasserman Schultz, Rubio has said \"we should be considering internment\" of Muslims, and \"maybe we should close down cafes and diners where Muslims gather and in fact compared them to the Nazi party.\"\nRubio has not called for internment of Muslims. This is flatly wrong. Her paraphrases about Rubio wanting to close Muslim cafes and diners and comparing Muslims to Nazis are at least missing context.\nBut to suggest he wants internment of Muslims \u2014 to take away their freedom and rights in the United States and separate them from the rest of society \u2014 is a grave accusation that leaves listeners with a grossly misleading impression of Rubio\u2019s statements.\nWe rate her claim Pants on Fire.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/51f9656b-4a00-401b-a3df-dafa0dd1c43f", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05632"}
