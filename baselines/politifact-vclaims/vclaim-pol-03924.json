I mean, it was an electoral landslide and the American people agreed that Donald Trump\u2019s vision for America is what this country has been waiting for.\"\nThere was considerable political earth shaking after Trump\u2019s triumph over Democrat Hillary Clinton, even though she won the popular vote.\nBut was Trump\u2019s win in the Electoral College, the result that mattered, a landslide?\nHow the Electoral College works\nVoters cast ballots for candidates, but it is electors from each state who actually elect the president. That\u2019s the way it\u2019s always been in the United States. The states are assigned a number of electors based on population. The total number of electors is 538, with each state being assigned electors based on population.\nThus, you need half-plus-one -- the magic 270 votes -- to win in the Electoral College.\n(Some Democrats want to scrap the Electoral College, but some Republicans have also backed election through popular vote. After Trump\u2019s win, PolitiFact Georgia rated True a claim that former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a major Trump supporter, had previously backed using the popular vote.)\nGo here to see a 1-minute video on how the Electoral College works.\nThe Electoral College doesn\u2019t sign, seal and deliver the final tallies until Dec. 19, 2016, a month and a day before Trump\u2019s inauguration.\nBut the margin, according to the Associated Press, is Trump 290 and Clinton 232, with Michigan\u2019s 16 electoral votes still not officially determined. Trump holds a lead in Michigan, however, and is expected to win the state. So, giving him the benefit of the doubt, the electoral votes would be:\nTrump: 306\nClinton: 232\nDoes that constitute a landslide?\nSome really big landslides\nLandslide, of course, is not technically defined. When we asked for information to back Priebus\u2019 claim, the Republican National Committee merely recited the electoral figures and repeated that it was a landslide.\nCountering Priebus, the Wisconsin Democratic Party pointed out that six times since 1952 alone, the winning candidate won substantially more electoral votes than Trump:\n\n\n\n\nPresident\n\n\nElection year\n\n\nElectoral votes won\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRonald Reagan (R)\n\n\n1984\n\n\n525\n\n\n\n\nReagan\n\n\n1980\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin LeMahieu\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a TV interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It takes quite a while on Election Day to load those ballots, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n489\n\n\n\n\nRichard Nixon (R)\n\n\n1972\n\n\n520\n\n\n\n\nLyndon Johnson (D)\n\n\n1964\n\n\n486\n\n\n\n\nDwight Eisenhower (R)\n\n\n1956\n\n\n457\n\n\n\n\nEisenhower\n\n\n1952\n\n\n442\n\n\n\n\nDemocrat Barack Obama\u2019s totals, by the way, were 332 in 2012 and 365 in 2008. These totals, too, are more than Trump.\nStill, just because some candidates won by larger margins doesn\u2019t necessarily mean Trump didn\u2019t win in a landslide.\nSo, we consulted 10 experts.\nOther views\nOne said it was close to a landslide, but none said Trump had crossed the threshold.\nCostas Panagopoulos, director of the Center for Electoral Politics and Democracy at Fordham University, said Trump\u2019s winning 57 percent of the Electoral College vote makes it \"pretty close\" to a landslide. He said 60 percent is generally considered to be a landslide, at least when it comes to the popular vote.\nBut the others all said Trump fell short.\nTaegan Goddard, founder of Political Wire, said the threshold should be 400 electoral votes. He said that was a figure often cited, prior to the election, when there were predictions of a Clinton landslide.\nAlex Keyssar, a professor of history and social policy at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School of Government, went much lower -- 330 -- though still above what Trump has earned. Keyssar, former chairman of the Social Science Research Council's National Research Commission on Voting and Elections, acknowledged the figure is \"pure impression.\"\nPolitical scientist Barry Burden, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said the Trump margin comes up short in another way. From 1952 to 2012, the winning candidate got an average of 73 percent of the electoral votes, well above Trump\u2019s 57 percent.\n\"Losing the popular vote also takes the shine off any Electoral College victory,\" Burden added, a point echoed by Herb Asher, a political science professor emeritus at Ohio State University.\nAlso voting no on landslide were John Woolley, a University of California, Santa Barbara political science professor and co-founder of the American Presidency Project; and Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. Sabato also runs Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball, an election analysis website.\n\"Calling a 306 electoral-vote victory a \u2018landslide\u2019 is ridiculous,\" Sabato told us. \"Trump\u2019s Electoral College majority is actually similar to John F. Kennedy\u2019s 303 in 1960 and Jimmy Carter\u2019s 297 in 1976. Has either of those victories ever been called a landslide? Of course not \u2014 and JFK and Carter actually won the popular vote narrowly.\"\nAdded Boston University history professor Bruce Schulman : \"To say that Trump won by a landslide, then Obama won by even bigger landslides.\"\nIndeed, the narrower of Obama\u2019s two wins -- in 2012 with 332 electoral votes -- was described at the time as not being a landslide by The Atlantic, Politico, conservative columnist Jonah Goldberg, Fox News\u2019 Brit Hume and others.\nOur rating\nPriebus said Trump\u2019s win was \"an electoral landslide.\"\nBut aside from the fact Trump lost the popular vote, his margin in the Electoral College isn\u2019t all that high, either. None of the 10 experts we contacted said Trump\u2019s win crosses that threshold.\nWe rate Priebus\u2019 claim False.\n Share the Facts   Politifact    5 7  Politifact Rating: False  Says Donald Trump's presidential victory was \"an electoral landslide.\"    Reince Priebus RNC Chairman   In an interview Monday, November 14, 2016 11/14/2016    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03924"}
