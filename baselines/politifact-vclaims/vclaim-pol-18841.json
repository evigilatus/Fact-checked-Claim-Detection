Democratic candidate Theresa Greenfield has honed in on Republican Sen. Joni Ernst\u2019s past votes to repeal and replace the ACA, while Ernst has been adamant that she supports people with preexisting conditions.\u00a0\nIn\u00a0an Oct. 22 tweet, Greenfield again criticized Ernst\u2019s record on health care.\u00a0\n\"She\u2019s voted repeatedly to repeal the ACA, and now she supports the lawsuit that\u2019s headed to the Supreme Court that will do just that,\" Greenfield tweeted. Greenfield and Democrats have been critical of the lawsuit, and Greenfield has\u00a0called on Ernst to publicly oppose it.\nA look at congressional records shows Ernst has cast multiple votes to repeal the ACA, and similar claims have been vetted by\u00a0other fact-checkers. But here, we\u2019re focusing on Greenfield\u2019s second claim \u2014 that Ernst supports the lawsuit coming up in the Supreme Court that could invalidate the Affordable Care Act.\u00a0\nThe lawsuit\nThe lawsuit Greenfield references\u00a0challenges\u00a0the ACA\u2019s constitutionality and is under appeal in the case\u00a0California v. Texas.\u00a0\nA mandate that required most people to have some level of health insurance or face a penalty tax was zeroed out in the\u00a0Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Twenty states, represented by Texas, are suing the federal government, arguing the mandate is not constitutional and the whole law should be struck down. Iowa is one of 20 states and the District of Columbia that are defending the ACA. Democratic Attorney General Tom Miller\u00a0joined the defense on appeal\u00a0in February 2019.\u00a0\nThe Supreme Court is to hear oral arguments in the case soon after the election, on Nov. 10.\u00a0\nErnst\u2019s stance on the lawsuit\nErnst has not expressed a hard position on the lawsuit during this year\u2019s campaign and has declined to say whether or not she supports or opposes it, saying the decision is up to the courts.\u00a0\n\"We\u2019ll see what the decision is. But that\u2019s in the court\u2019s hands,\" Ernst\u00a0told Politico in September.\nWhen we contacted the Greenfield campaign for evidence to back up its claim that Ernst supports the lawsuit, staffers said that Ernst\u2019s history of opposing the ACA, her lack of a stance on the lawsuit, and her vote to cut the individual mandate are all signs that she supports the lawsuit.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There\u2019s absolutely no doubt that Senator Ernst supports the ongoing anti-ACA lawsuit,\" campaign spokesperson Izzi Levy wrote in an email to\u00a0Politifact.\u00a0\"\u2026In fact, Theresa even called on Senator Ernst to oppose this harmful lawsuit on the first day of the general election. But since then, Ernst has consistently refused to speak out or take any meaningful action to stop it.\"\nErnst has a history of antagonism against the ACA. She campaigned in 2014 on repealing the law. She\u00a0voted for three measures to replace the ACA\u00a0in 2017 and also voted\u00a0to begin debate on a bill\u00a0that would have eliminated the provision that prevents insurers from dropping coverage for people with preexisting conditions. Two years earlier,\u00a0she voted\u00a0to approve the fiscal 2016 federal budget that\u00a0included provisions\u00a0for adjustments tied to repealing the ACA. She has criticized the law throughout the 2020 campaign, saying it\u00a0caused health care prices to go up.\nErnst has been more careful in her recent criticism and votes related to the ACA. On Oct. 1, she\u00a0voted with Democrats on a bid to block\u00a0the U.S. Justice Department from supporting the lawsuit. She was one of six Republican senators who crossed the party line, all of them vulnerable from Democratic challengers in the fall election.\u00a0Ernst said\u00a0her vote showed her support for protecting people who have preexisting conditions.\u00a0\nThe vote was called symbolic by both\u00a0Politico\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0Washington Post, and it\u00a0was seen\u00a0by political opponents and some political analysts as a decision from Republicans in competitive elections to avoid backlash.\u00a0\nWhile it signals opposition and prevents Ernst\u2019s opponents from having another point to attack her on, it doesn\u2019t show that Ernst opposes the lawsuit itself. The lawsuit would have continued whether or not it had backing from the Justice Department because the department is not part of the original lawsuit or\u00a0ruling.\nWhen asked whether Ernst supports or opposes the lawsuit, campaign spokesperson Brendan Conley said she hasn\u2019t taken a position on it.\n\"Joni has made clear that this is being taken up by the courts and that her focus is on taking Iowans\u2019 fight to Congress to ensure we maintain protections for those with preexisting conditions,\" Conley wrote in an email to\u00a0PolitiFact.\nErnst also\u00a0supported the law\u00a0that ultimately led to the lawsuit. The 2017 Republican-led Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which eliminated the penalty from the individual mandate, set the ground for the constitutionality of the law to be challenged.\u00a0\nErnst has continued to promote the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on the campaign trail in 2020.\nOur ruling\nGreenfield said that Ernst supports the lawsuit striking down the Affordable Care Act. But Ernst has failed to give a clear, publicly stated stance on the lawsuit. Greenfield\u2019s claim is based on Ernst\u2019s consistently critical assessment of the ACA and votes in favor of repealing the law. Ernst also voted to cut the individual mandate, which led to the law being challenged in court.\u00a0\nEven though Ernst hasn\u2019t taken a position on the lawsuit itself, she\u2019s expressed a repeated desire to roll back the ACA.
