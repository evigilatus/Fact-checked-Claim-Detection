Ted Cruz, R-Texas, told the reporter that D\u2019Souza faced political persecution for a crime liberal comedian Rosie O\u2019Donnell had committed five-fold. (Cruz also claimed credit for the pardon and called D\u2019Souza his friend.)\n\"What\u2019s interesting is, just a few weeks ago we saw revelations that Rosie O\u2019Donnell apparently committed the same offense five times, five times, when she broke the identical law that Dinesh was prosecuted for,\" Cruz said. \"I don\u2019t recall any of those liberal activists on Twitter calling for Rose O\u2019Donnell to be prosecuted.\"\nDid O\u2019Donnell commit the same offense as D\u2019Souza? The two cases are very different.\nThe Federal Election Commission caps donations to individual candidates at $2,700 per election. Primaries, runoffs and general elections are counted separately.\nOn May 20, 2014, D\u2019Souza was convicted of a felony for making illegal contributions to Wendy Long\u2019s unsuccessful challenge of Kirsten Gillibrand to represent New York in the U.S. Senate. Long was a friend from D\u2019Souza\u2019s time at Dartmouth College.\nD\u2019Souza was allowed to contribute a maximum of $5,000 to a single candidate. (The limit on each election was $2,500 in 2012 due to inflation, and this covered the primary and general election.) In March 2012, D\u2019Souza gave $10,000 on behalf of himself and his wife. He then directed his assistant and a lover to also contribute $5,000 each on behalf of themselves and their spouses for a total of $20,000. D\u2019Souza reimbursed them.\nD\u2019Souza pleaded guilty \"to violating the federal campaign election law by making illegal contributions to a United States Senate campaign in the names of others,\" the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York said in a statement. He \"admitted that he knew that what he was doing was wrong and something the law forbids.\"\nD\u2019Souza faced eight months in a supervised community confinement center, five years of probation, and a $30,000 fine. Trump pardoned D\u2019Souza on May 31.\nThe New York Post reported that O\u2019Donnell made the following contributions, exceeding the individual limit of $2,700\u00a0by a total of $5,400.\n\n\n$4,700 to Alabama Sen. Doug Jones in the special general election against Roy Moore.\n\n\n$3,600 to Pennsylvania Rep. Conor Lamb for the special election he won in March.\n\n\n$2,950 to California Rep. Adam Schiff for his primary congressional race.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$4,200 to Lauren Underwood, an Illinois congressional candidate, for her primary. (Note: when we searched the FEC individual contributor database, we found $2,700 are marked as going towards the primary campaign and $1,500 towards the general.)\n\n\n$3,450 to Omar Vaid, a congressional candidate in Staten Island and Brooklyn, for his primary.\n\n\nO\u2019Donnell told the New York Post she did not deliberately exceed the limit.\n\"If $2,700 is the cut off \u2014 (candidates) should refund the money,\" she said. \"I don\u2019t look to see who I can donate most to \u2026 I just donate assuming they do not accept what is over the limit.\"\nO\u2019Donnell indeed broke FEC rules, but campaign finance experts told us this type of violation goes unpunished as long as there is no intent to deceive. The money can be refunded or redirected to the candidate\u2019s next race.\n\"The rather small amounts in excess of the limits, as well as the fact that O\u2019Donnell made no effort to conceal the contributions, indicates this is just a sloppy mistake,\" said Craig Holman, a government affairs lobbyist at the left-leaning watchdog group Public Citizen.\n\"Rosie O'Donnell contributed her own money in her own name to the candidates in question,\" said Michael Malbin, executive director at the Campaign Finance Institute. \"The candidates are in fact responsible for keeping records and returning the extra, although she should also know what she is doing, as most donors do. Her contributions were fully disclosed.\"\nIn an op-ed calling out a double standard, D\u2019Souza said he did not buy O\u2019Donnell\u2019s defense.\n\"I find this defense implausible because O\u2019Donnell used four different \u2013 though similar \u2013variations of her name and five different addresses,\" D\u2019Souza wrote.\nThe variations in her name were as follows: Rose Odonnell, Rose O\u2019Donnell, Rosie O\u2019Donnell, and Rosie Odonnell. She listed two different zip codes (which correspond with homes she owns) in two of the donations that exceeded the limit.\nExperts said D\u2019Souza\u2019s case was distinct by legal standards. D\u2019Souza violated statutes 52 U.S.C. 30116 for exceeding contribution limits, 52 U.S.C. 30122 for making contributions in the name of another, and 18 U.S.C. 1001 for lying to law enforcement. The last (and most serious) charge was eventually dropped in the plea bargain.\nO\u2019Donnell violated only the first statute. But criminal enforcement is only deemed appropriate if the violation is knowing and willful. Violators are usually subject to a civil penalty instead. The FEC has not announced an investigation of O\u2019Donnell, although Holman said they \"likely deemed that violation as unintentional and just not worth their time.\"\nOur ruling\nCruz said, \"Rosie O\u2019Donnell apparently committed the same offense five times, five times, when she broke the identical law that Dinesh was prosecuted for.\"\nBoth D\u2019Souza and O\u2019Donnell violated campaign contribution limits, which is a criminal offense. Those cases are subject to prosecution if determined to be willful. D\u2019Souza\u2019s violation was considered willful. He violated another law by using straw donors to donate $20,000 over the legal limit to one Senate candidate. O\u2019Donnell surpassed the limit by a quarter of that money in donating to five different campaigns under her own name.\nWe rate this statement False.\n Share the Facts 2018-06-06 19:58:16 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  \u201cRosie O\u2019Donnell apparently committed the same offense five times, five times, when she broke the identical law that Dinesh was prosecuted for.\u201d    Ted Cruz U.S. Senator from Texas https://politics.blog.mystatesman.com/2018/06/04/at-maverick-pac-he-founded-ted-cruz-finds-himself-amid-a-younger-hurds-herd-of-less-polarizing-politicians/   In an interview Monday, June 4, 2018 2018-06-04    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01990"}
