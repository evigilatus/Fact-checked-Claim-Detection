He says that an Arizona press conference held Nov. 30 by Trump lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Ellis caused him to reevaluate his belief in the legitimacy of the election results.\nCiting statements from the meeting, the man claims that Dominion Voting Systems, which makes software and hardware for election officials to use around the country, is owned by Hugo Chavez, the deceased former president of Venezuela.\u00a0\n\"Hugo Chavez\u2019s family still owns the company,\" reads the headline of the video.\u00a0\nThe post, which has been viewed more than 74,000 times, was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

There is no evidence to support the claim that the Chavez family owns Dominion.\u00a0\nDominion\u2019s real ownership\nDominion was founded in 2003 in Toronto, Canada, not Venezuela. In 2018, the company was acquired by Staple Street Capital, a private equity firm based in New York.\u00a0\nIn an April letter to the House Committee on Administration, Dominion CEO John Poulos said that Staple Street Capital owns a 75.2% stake in the company. Poulos, a Canadian citizen, wrote that he holds a 12% stake and that no other investor owns more than a 5% stake, according to the Associated Press.\u00a0\n\"Dominion is not and has never been a front for communists. It has no ties to Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, the late dictator of Venezuela,\" Poulos wrote in an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal. \"It has never been involved in Venezuelan elections.\"\nClaim appears tied to another conspiracy theory\nThe speaker\u2019s claim about Dominion echoes a baseless conspiracy theory that we have debunked in the past.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe thrust of the theory is that Smartmatic, a separate firm that builds electronic voting systems, is a Venezuelan company with close ties to Hugo Chavez.\u00a0\nThe founders of Smartmatic were born in Venezuela, but the company itself was founded in Boca Raton, Fla.\u00a0\nSmartmatic says it has no affiliation with Chavez, who died in 2013, or with the current Venezuelan government.\u00a0\nAccording to the company\u2019s website, Smartmatic is run by its two founders, Antonio Mugica and Roger Pi\u00f1ate; 83% of its shares are held by SGO, a London-based company owned by the Mugica and Pi\u00f1ate families. An additional 10% of its shares are held by employees, and 7% by outside investors.\u00a0\u00a0\nSmartmatic voting systems have been used in elections around the world, including Venezuela. In 2017, the company said that its technology was manipulated to report a skewed vote total during a Venezuelan election. The company accused the Venezuelan government of election fraud, and it stopped its work there the following year. Smartmatic has claimed that the incident was an anomaly likely due to the lack of election monitors.\u00a0\nSmartmatic technology was not used in any of the battleground states won by Biden where Trump allies are disputing the results.\u00a0\nIn order to draw a link between Smartmatic and the 2020 U.S. election, Trump supporters have baselessly alleged that the company owns its competitor Dominion, which was used to tabulate votes in key battleground states. But both Dominion and Smartmatic have issued statements denying that they are affiliated with each other. The companies have also denied that they use each other\u2019s software.\u00a0\nEddie Perez, a voting technology expert, told the Associated Press that there was no reason to believe that Dominion and Smartmatic have ties to each other or to Venezuela.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nA Facebook video claims that \"Hugo Chavez\u2019s family still owns\" Dominion Voting Systems.\nAccording to Dominion, 75.2% of its shares are owned by Staple Street Capital, a New York-based private equity firm, and 12% of its shares are owned by John Poulos, its CEO. No other investor holds more than a 5% stake in the company.\u00a0\nThe claim \u2014 which is tied to other baseless conspiracy theories that we have debunked\u00a0\u2014\u00a0 is not accurate. We rate it False.\u00a0\u200b", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17230"}
