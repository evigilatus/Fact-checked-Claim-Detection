He did, and Woodward\u2019s tape explains why", "text": "Confronted with a recording of President Donald Trump from mid March saying that he minimized the coronavirus in public, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said the opposite was true.\n\"The president never downplayed the virus,\" she said in a White House press briefing Sept. 9.\nMcEnany was responding to the release of recorded interviews from investigative reporter Bob Woodward\u2019s new book about Trump entitled \"Rage.\" The audio posted by the Washington Post shows Trump explaining to Woodward why his message about the virus shifted between January and March.\n\"To be honest with you, I wanted to always play it down,\" Trump said March 19. \"I still like playing it down, because I don\u2019t want to create a panic.\"\nMcEnany said Trump never lied to the American people.\u00a0\n\"He was expressing calm, and he was taking early action, and his actions are reflective of how seriously he took it,\" she said.\nWe tracked Trump\u2019s responses as the pandemic unfolded. Between January and mid March, Trump consistently minimized the threat posed by the virus. He would talk about the handful of cases in the country and compare them with the more than 25,000 deaths caused by seasonal flu. He said the country had gotten \"lucky.\"\nHere are some key moments in the early months of the pandemic that show him downplaying the threat.\nOn Jan. 24, Trump tweeted his thanks to China for working to contain the virus.\n\"It will all work out well,\" he wrote.\u00a0\nChina has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus. The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well. In particular, on behalf of the American People, I want to thank President Xi!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 24, 2020 \nOn Jan. 30, Trump announced restrictions on travel from China. That night, he told supporters at a campaign rally in Iowa, \"We think we have it very well under control. We have very little problem in this country at this moment \u2014 five. ... We think it\u2019s going to have a very good ending for it.\"\nOn Feb. 2, he told Fox News host Sean Hannity, \"We pretty much shut it down coming in from China.\"\u00a0\nOn Feb. 14, in a meeting with members of the Border Patrol Council, he remained reassuring.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPat Toomey\n\n\nstated on January 19, 2021 in a hearing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere will be several thousand dollars in payments going to families with six-figure incomes who\u2019ve had no income interruption whatsoever.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jessica Calefati \u2022 January 21, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have a very small number of people in the country, right now, with it. It\u2019s like around 12. Many of them are getting better. Some are fully recovered already. So we\u2019re in very good shape.\"\nOn Feb. 24, Trump asked Congress for $1.25 billion in emergency aid. The same day he tweeted that the virus \"is very much under control\" and the stock market was \"starting to look very good to me!\"\u00a0\nThe Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC & World Health have been working hard and very smart. Stock Market starting to look very good to me!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 24, 2020 \nAs late as March 9, Trump tweeted out blame to the media and the Democrats for trying to \"inflame\" the situation \"far beyond what the facts would warrant.\" He cited the U.S. surgeon general as saying, \"The risk is low to the average American.\"\nThe Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, is doing everything within its semi-considerable power (it used to be greater!) to inflame the CoronaVirus situation, far beyond what the facts would warrant. Surgeon General, \u201cThe risk is low to the average American.\u201d\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 9, 2020 \nOver the next few days, the situation changed rapidly. The World Health Organization officially designated the virus as a pandemic. Trump banned most non-Americans arriving from Europe. He declared a state of emergency.\u00a0\nOn March 17, Trump said in a news conference that for the next 14 days, \"we\u2019re asking everyone to work at home, if possible, postpone unnecessary travel, and limit social gatherings to no more than 10 people.\"\nAt the news conference, Trump said there was no shift in tone from the White House: \"I've always known this is a real, this is a pandemic. I've felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic.\"\nWe rated that claim Pants on Fire because whatever he may have known at the time, his words up to that point did not reflect the threat of a pandemic.\nTwo days after that, he spoke to Woodward about why he downplayed the virus earlier and why he wanted to continue to downplay\u00a0it.\nOur ruling\nMcEnany said Trump never downplayed the virus.\u00a0\nThe record shows she\u2019s wrong. During the early months of the coronavirus outbreak, Trump said the country was in very good shape and blamed Democrats and the media for trying to inflame the situation beyond what the facts would warrant.\u00a0\nIn the very tape that McEnany was asked about, Trump said he downplayed the virus to avoid creating panic. McEnany spun that as him showing leadership to calm a worried nation.\nThe reasons Trump said what he said aren\u2019t part of this fact-check. Trump\u2019s words are. And they give zero support to McEnany\u2019s statement.\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18890"}
