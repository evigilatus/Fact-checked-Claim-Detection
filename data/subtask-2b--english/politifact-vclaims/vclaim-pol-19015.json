The seat opened when Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died on Sept. 18.\u00a0\nSome claims on Facebook offered false takes on her record.\n\"Amy Barret said gays have a right to be discriminated against because they are against Gods wishes and won't be allowed. Heaven,\" one Facebook user wrote, misspelling her last name and omitting punctuation.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"Amy Barret says white people are Gods chosen ones. Minorities must submit to them and that's Gods plan. Obedience,\" reads another post from the same user.\u00a0\nTo be clear: Barrett never said either of these things. These Facebook posts were flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nA review of her judicial opinions, public statements and academic writing hasn\u2019t produced any quotes along these lines. Barrett clerked for late Justice Antonin Scalia before joining the faculty of Notre Dame Law School, where she taught for 15 years. Trump nominated her to the appellate court in 2017.\u00a0\nBarrett has a limited judicial record compared with other Supreme Court nominees that Trump is reportedly considering. Timothy R. Johnson, a professor of political science and law at the University of Minnesota, told PolitiFact that Barrett\u2019s relatively sparse paper trail makes it difficult to predict how she\u2019ll rule if nominated and confirmed to the Supreme Court.\nReligious background\nBarrett has described herself as a devout Catholic. A liberal group on Instagram warning against her potential nomination pointed out her involvement in a Christian group called People of Praise. The New York Times reported that the group supports gender roles where husbands have authority over their wives.\u00a0\nDemocratic senators have pointed to an article she co-wrote early in her career as reason for concern that she would not work with impartiality. The article argued that Catholic judges should have the right to recuse themselves from cases that conflict with their personal beliefs, such as those involving the death penalty.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring her confirmation hearing for the appeals court, Barrett pushed back, saying that she \"would never impose my own personal convictions upon the law.\"\nBarrett\u2019s supporters have said the controversy over her religious beliefs is a form of anti-Catholic bias, pointing out that other members of the court are Catholics.\u00a0\nWhat LGBTQ and abortion rights organizations say\nBarrett never said that \"gays have a right to be discriminated against.\"\nBut LGBTQ rights and abortion rights organizations have criticized her past appointment. In 2017, the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, a civil rights organization that focuses on LGBTQ communities, penned an open letter to U.S. senators opposing Barrett\u2019s appointment to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.\u00a0\nLambda Legal took issue with a letter that Barrett had signed that defined marriage as the \"indissoluble commitment between a man and a woman,\" and a talk that she gave at the Alliance Defending Freedom, a legal organization that opposes LGBTQ rights.\u00a0\nSupporters of abortion rights are concerned about Barrett\u2019s abortion views.\nIn a 2013 interview, Barrett said that she believes that life begins at conception. In an article, she wrote that the Catholic Church\u2019s views on prohibiting abortion are \"absolute\" because they \"take away innocent life.\" She has ruled against abortion rights in the two abortion cases that she has heard on the bench.\nFinally, the post claims Barrett has white supremacist views. We found no evidence of that\u00a0in a review of Barret\u2019s record.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nFacebook posts claim that Barrett said that \"gays have a right to be discriminated against because they are against Gods wishes\" and that \"white people are Gods chosen ones.\"\nBarrett has never said anything along these lines.\u00a0\nWe rate these posts False.\u00a0\u200b", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19015"}
