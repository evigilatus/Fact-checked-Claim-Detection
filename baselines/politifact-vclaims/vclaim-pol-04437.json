We must ensure that they have support to adjust to civilian life,\" Harris, a Democrat, said on Twitter on August 18, 2016.\n\nHarris made the same claim about veterans suicides on her website here, where she adds that she\u2019ll work \"to ensure that every Veteran knows what benefits they earned and how to access those benefits.\"\nWe wondered whether the suicide statistic Harris used is correct. \u00a0\nChecking a somber number\nHer campaign spokesman said Harris used a widely-cited figure of 22 suicides per day from the VA\u2019s 2012 Suicide Data Report, which examined veterans deaths in 21 states, from 1999 to 2011.\nThat study\u2019s researchers, as noted by the Washington Post Fact Checker, cautioned against the use of the 22-deaths figure more than once in the study: \"It is recommended that the estimated number of veterans be interpreted with caution due to the use of data from a sample of states.\"\nResearchers gave a range of 18 to 22 veteran suicides a day.\nHarris chose the high-end of this range.\nImportantly, Harris\u2019 figure of 22 suicides per day fails to account for research the VA released in July for its most comprehensive report yet on veteran suicides.\nThe VA examined about 55 million veterans records from 1979 through 2014. It found that in 2014, the latest year for which figures are available, 7,403 veterans took their own lives, or an average of about 20 a day.\nThat\u2019s close to the 22 suicides per day cited by Harris, a figure that continues to be used by many others despite the new, more extensive research.\nIt does not take away from the point Harris is trying to make: That the rate of veterans suicide is far too high. VA figures show that in 2014 veterans accounted for 18 percent of all deaths from suicides among adults in the United States while they made up only 8.5 percent of the population.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin Nunes\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in an interview on Fox\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRepublicans have no way to communicate\u201d after tech companies cut off Parler.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Amy Sherman \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCapital Public Radio / File photo\nOne prominent voice in American politics has cited the new number.\nPolitiFact Virginia rated a claim by Donald Trump in July that \"a shocking 20 veterans are committing suicide each and every day, especially our older veterans,\" as True, based on this new report.\nPolitiFact Virginia added that the VA always acknowledged that this old study (from 2012) was limited. Notably absent were records for California and Texas \u2014 two states with very high veteran populations.\nThe new figure of 20 veteran suicides a day is based on records from every state.\nWhen asked, Harris\u2019 campaign spokesman acknowledged there has been new research.\n\"Kamala believes strongly we must work hard to get that number to zero,\" the spokesman added.\nOld study widely cited\nHarris is not the only person to cite the 22 suicides per day statistic from the old study.\nHer opponent and fellow Democrat in the race for U.S. Senate \u2014 U.S. Representative Loretta Sanchez \u2014 has repeated it, including in this video posted in November 2015.\nOur ruling\nKamala Harris recently said \"22 veterans take their own lives each day.\"\nThe number she cites relies on data from a 2012 VA study by the VA, which was limited and included caveats.\nThat old report\u00a0has been widely cited by Republicans and Democrats, including Harris\u2019 opponent in her run for U.S. Senate.\nBut Harris\u2019 claim ignores research the VA released in July for its most comprehensive report yet on veteran suicides, with records from all states.\nThe new study found an average of about 20 veterans a day, two fewer than what Harris claimed.\nHarris\u2019 statement is\u00a0close, but needs clarification or additional information.\nWe rate her claim Mostly True.\n\nMOSTLY TRUE\u00a0\u2013 The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.\nClick here for\u00a0more\u00a0on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04437"}
