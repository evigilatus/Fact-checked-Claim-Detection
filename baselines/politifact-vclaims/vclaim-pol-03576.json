Not so fast", "text": "Few states top Wisconsin\u2019s K-12 graduation rate -- and the rate has gone up in recent years.\nState School Superintendent Tony Evers boasted on his Facebook page on Feb. 13, 2017 that \"Wisconsin\u2019s graduation rates have grown to over 90 percent\" since his election.\nEvers is seeking a third term in the April 2017 election against challenger Lowell Holtz, a former school superintendent and principal.\nWhen asked to back up the Facebook claim, the Evers campaign pointed to graduation rates published by the agency Evers oversees, the Department of Public Instruction.\nThe reports, they say, show a rate of 85.7 percent in 2009-10 (Evers\u2019 first year) that rose to more than 90 percent in subsequent years.\nCase closed?\nNo. Let\u2019s put our red pencil and green eye shade to work.\nHow rates are tracked\nThe state and federal governments employ two methods to track changes in the four-year graduation rate.\nThe first method -- dating to the 1960s -- estimates the four-year graduation rate from aggregate figures on enrollment and graduate counts.\nIt shows Wisconsin\u2019s rate was above 90 percent before Evers even took office. The latest figure reported under that method: 92 percent, in 2011-12.\nThe second method, which is newer and more accurate, tracks detailed student-level data.\nThat method dates to 2009-10 in Wisconsin. It shows a rising rate from 85.7 percent in Evers\u2019 first year up to 88.4 percent in 2014-15.\nSo neither approach backs up Evers\u2019 claim.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin LeMahieu\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a TV interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It takes quite a while on Election Day to load those ballots, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the record, the state\u2019s rate of 88.4 percent for on-time graduation (four years) ranked 6th-highest nationally by the latest numbers, which is actually a drop from No. 2 four years earlier.\nBehind the claim\nSo where do the numbers cited by the Evers campaign come from?\nThose numbers look at how many students from a 9th-grade class graduate over five or six years, not four years.\nWisconsin began tracking so-called \"extended-year graduation\" in Evers\u2019 first year; dozens of other states also collect it.\nViewed this way, Evers campaign says, the class of 2009-10 four-year graduation rate for the class of 2009-10 was 85.7 percent. It rose to 89.5 percent after five years and to 90.4 percent after six years.\nA similar growth pattern appears in later years, when you track an individual class.\nBut we can\u2019t judge if the same thing was happening before Evers, because the collection of the extended-year graduation rate didn\u2019t start until his second year.\nSo we can\u2019t fully evaluate whether these figures show that \"Wisconsin\u2019s graduation rates have grown to over 90 percent\" since he took over.\nBut, even if they did, it would apply to the less-used \"extended-year rate,\" not the more conventional 4-year rate that is better known to the average person.\nOur rating\nEvers claimed on Facebook: \"Wisconsin\u2019s graduation rates have grown to over 90%\" since he became state school superintendent.\nBy the traditional measure -- graduation in four years -- Wisconsin\u2019s rate is one of the best in America, but still below 90 percent using one approach. Using the other, it topped that mark before Evers even took office.\nMeanwhile, the extended-year graduation rate provides an element of truth to the claim.\nThat puts it at \u00a0Mostly False.\n Share the Facts   Politifact    4 7  Politifact Rating: Mostly False  \"Wisconsin\u2019s graduation rates have grown to over 90 percent\" since Tony Evers became state school superintendent.
