Clovis is the Department of Agriculture\u2019s senior White House adviser, but reportedly lacks a science background. He has a doctorate in public administration, has taught business, management and public policy at Morningside College in Iowa, hosted a conservative radio show and was a Trump campaign policy adviser.\u00a0\nHas he disparaged scientists as USPOLN.com said? Facebook users flagged the post as potential fake news. We found that quotes attributed to Clovis are indeed fake.\nUSPOLN.com calls itself a \"hybrid News/Satire platform,\" and we\u2019ve included it in our list of websites that deliberately post false or fake stories.\nA disclaimer in its \"About Us\" page plainly tells readers its intentions and accuracy: \u00a0\n\"USPOLN may include information from sources that may or may not be reliable and facts that don\u2019t necessarily exist. These Articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney.\"\nThe USPOLN.com story about Clovis heavily borrows, almost verbatim, multiple paragraphs from a May 12 report from ProPublica, an independent, nonprofit, investigative journalism website.\u00a0\nUSPOLN.com\u2019s opening sentences:\u00a0\n\"The research section of the USDA studies everything from nutrition to climate change, and according to the 2008 Farm Bill the \u2018chief scientist\u2019 is supposed to be the leader \u2018among distinguished scientists with specialized or significant experience in agricultural research, education and economics.\u2019 President Donald Trump\u2019s pick, Sam Clovis, doesn\u2019t seem to have any of those credentials. He has never taken science as part of his graduate course and questions the legitimacy of climate change. Although he has a doctorate in public administration and taught business and public policy at Morningside College for ten years, he barely published any academic work. Clovis had made a reputation for himself as a conservative talk radio show in Iowa and an avid Trump supporter.\"\nProPublica\u2019 first few sentences:\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The USDA\u2019s research section studies everything from climate change to nutrition.

While he has a doctorate in public administration and was a tenured professor of business and public policy at Morningside College for 10 years, he has published almost no academic work.\"\nUSPOLN.com\u2019s post takes a satirical turn when it starts \"quoting\" Clovis on his comments about his credentials in an assumed interview with \"KYXL Radio\" (searches on the Federal Communications Commission website for a radio station with those call letters yielded zero results).\nThe satirical website said Clovis \"argued that he was \u2018proud\u2019 he didn\u2019t have any scientific credentials or education, because \u2018scientists are nothing more than a bunch of mislead (sic) individuals anyway\u2019.\"\u00a0\nThe post also falsely claims Clovis said he thanks God he did not make him a scientist and that he\u2019s proud not to be one \"because they believe in things like evolution and the like.\"\nUSPOLN.com links as its \"source\" another \"hybrid News/Satire\" site that has the same article posted.\nWe asked the USDA to confirm if Clovis was Trump\u2019s pick for the chief scientist job. The department said it could not comment in advance on any nominations for Senate-confirmed positions.\nWhat about the quotes from USPOLN.com?\n\"Completely fabricated,\" the department\u2019s communications office said, linking to a Snopes review of the story deeming the comments false.
