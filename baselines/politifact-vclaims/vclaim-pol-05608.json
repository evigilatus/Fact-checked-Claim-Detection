He has called for blocking virtually all non-American Muslims from entering the country. He said America should \"take out\" the families of terrorists.\nDuring the Republican debate in Las Vegas on CNN, the moderator used a question from the public to press Trump on this policy.\n\"How would intentionally killing innocent civilians set us apart from ISIS?\" asked Josh Jacob from Georgia Tech.\nTrump did not repeat his call to \"take out\" family members but insisted the country has to be much tougher on family members because of what they know.\n\"When you had the World Trade Center go, people were put into planes that were friends, family, girlfriends, and they were put into planes and they were sent back, for the most part, to Saudi Arabia,\" Trump said. \"They knew what was going on. They went home and they wanted to watch their boyfriends on television.\"\nWe reached out to the Trump campaign about the 9/11 terrorists\u2019 close friends and family members leaving before the attacks and did not hear back. Trump has said this before, sometimes saying specifically that they were sent home a few days before the attack. He told Fox News' Bill O'Reilly \"They take the wives, they put \u2018em on planes, they send \u2018em home. \u2018Let\u2019s go home and let\u2019s watch Daddy tonight on television knock down the World Trade Center.'\u00a0\"\nIn North Carolina, Trump told his supporters \"the people, the animals that did that, they sent their wives and their families back to Saudi Arabia. Most of them went back to Saudi Arabia. Those wives knew what their husbands were going to do.\"\nThe statement lacks any support.\nThe 9/11 hijackers\nTrump needs two pieces to back up his statement. First, at least some of the hijackers needed to be married or have a girlfriend, and second, those people, or some family member, needed to be in the United States.\nAccording to the 9/11 Commission report, not a single hijacker had a wife, girlfriend or family member in the country in the days and months before the terrorists executed their plan.\nOnly two of the 19 hijackers were married and only one had a girlfriend. Ziad Jarrah had a girlfriend in Germany, and hijackers Marwan al-Shehhi and Abdul Aziz al-Omari were married.\nPhilip D. Zelikow, executive director of the 9/11 Commission, told us\u00a0that while the commision didn't learn the exact whereabouts of the wives, whether in Saudi Arabia, Yemen or elsewhere in the Middle East, one thing is certain.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They sure weren\u2019t living in the United States,\" Zelikow said.\nIf no one was in America, there could be no flying home to \"watch their boyfriends on television.\"\nThe commission found no evidence that any of these women knew about the plot in advance. The commission reported that most of the terrorists had \"broken off regular contact with their families.\" The one clear exception was Jarrah, who traveled to Lebanon to see his father and vacationed with his girlfriend in Florida about eight months before the attack. Jarrah called her in Germany shortly before he boarded United Airlines flight 93, the plane that crashed in rural Pennsylvania.\nJarrah\u2019s girlfriend was extensively interviewed by investigators who concluded she knew nothing.\nTo be complete, we turn to one episode that could be linked to Trump\u2019s statement.\nBin Laden family members\nTrump\u2019s words might reflect some confusion with the hastily organized departures of members of Osama bin Laden\u2019s extended family\u00a0-- not any wives or girlfriends of bin Laden himself --\u00a0a few days after the attack.\u00a0\nMost of the bin Laden relatives were in high school or college in the United States. In an interview with the New York Times, Saudi Ambassador Bandar bin Sultan said that with the help of the FBI, his government arranged for these people to assemble in Washington where a chartered plane would take them back to Saudi Arabia.\nBin Laden is one of 52 children of a man who built enormous wealth building roads and palaces. That gave him a large extended and affluent family.\nThe 9/11 Commission report said that the FBI dug into the backgrounds of every Saudi national who flew home soon after the attacks.\n\"They concluded that none of the passengers was connected to the 9/11 attacks and have since found no evidence to change that conclusion,\" the report said. \"Our own independent review of the Saudi national involved confirms that no one with known links to terrorism departed on these flights.\"\nOur ruling\nTrump said that people close to the 9/11 hijackers -- friends, wives and girlfriends -- had knowledge of the pending attacks and were flown back to the Middle East so that they could \"watch their boyfriends on television.\"\nTrump provided no evidence. The 9/11 Commission investigation found that 13 of the 19 attackers were unmarried. Only two had wives, a third had a girlfriend, and none of those women were in the United States immediately before the attack. The commission further found evidence that the hijackers had cut ties with their families.\nThere is no substance behind the statement. We rate this claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05608"}
