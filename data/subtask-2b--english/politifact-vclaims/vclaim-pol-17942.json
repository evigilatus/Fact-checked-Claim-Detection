Large crowds have been gathering there since the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody in late May.\nThe incident is one of several in which motorists have targeted nationwide protests against police brutality in recent weeks. But a June 14 Facebook post claims that CNN\u2019s coverage of the Seattle shooting was manipulated.\n\"CNN lightened the photo of the man who drove into the protester last night in Seattle,\" reads text on the image, which was shared by a fan page for President Donald Trump \"They said he was white.. (check) out the real photo.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It\u2019s been shared more than 5,500 times, and we\u2019ve seen many similar posts online.\n\n(Screenshot from Facebook)\nOn June 12, Fox News ran digitally altered photos of the so-called Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone, also known as the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest, where demonstrators have gathered for the past week without police. Did CNN do the same thing?\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo \u2014\u00a0the social media posts are inaccurate. The photo of Fernandez appears to be doctored.\n\"This \u2018framegrab\u2019 social media post was flagged to us earlier, and it certainly looks doctored from all of our double checking,\" said Bridget Leininger, senior director of communications at CNN, in an email. \"CNN reported the story, but did not identify the person. Also, the logo added into this social media account\u2019s \u2018framegrab\u2019 is not CNN style. CNN does not alter skin tone.\"\nCNN\u2019s digital story about Fernandez does not identify or include an image of him. But just to be sure, we checked the tape.\nNone of the network\u2019s coverage from the week after the Seattle shooting included a close-up photo of Fernandez. Instead, it relied on eyewitness video that showed a car driving into a crowd and protesters running away.\nThe photo in the Facebook post includes a white CNN logo with a red background on top of the lightened image of Fernandez. But CNN\u2019s television coverage usually has a red logo with a white background in the lower third of the screen. It also includes the time and whether the coverage is live \u2014\u00a0details that the Facebook image leaves out.\n\n(Screenshot from CNN)\nThe original photo of Fernandez holding a gun was taken by Dean Rutz, a photographer for the Seattle Times. It does not appear to be lightened.\nThe Facebook post is inaccurate and makes a ridiculous claim. We rate it Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17942"}
