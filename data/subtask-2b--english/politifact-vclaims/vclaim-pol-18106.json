But in an appearance March 12 on CNN, Vice President Mike Pence said insurers have agreed to waive copays for coronavirus tests \u2014 not treatment.\u00a0\nThe telecast of Trump\u2019s March 10 meeting with the insurance industry shows that, in fact, company leaders agreed to waive all co-payments for coronavirus tests \u2014 not treatments.\n\"All the insurance companies here \u2014 either today or before today \u2014 have agreed to waive all copays on coronavirus testing and extend coverage for coronavirus treatment in all of their benefit plans,\" Pence said.\nThat\u2019s a big distinction.\nAn incomplete picture\nFor one thing, a shortage in diagnostic supplies means that many people aren\u2019t receiving tests. You have to present symptoms to qualify. If you don\u2019t receive a test, but do get screened, that qualifies as a doctor\u2019s visit \u2014 not a coronavirus test. That qualifies for a copay.\n\"It\u2019s not even waiving copays or deductibles for services you need to get tests \u2014 emergency visits, doctors, etc.,\" noted Sabrina Corlette, a professor at Georgetown University's Health Policy Institute. \"It\u2019s \u2018we\u2019ll waive copays for the tests,\u2019 which is the lab service.\"\nHealth plans will cover treatment for coronavirus, including hospital stays, said Kristine Grow, a spokeswoman for America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, a major lobbying group. But they won\u2019t necessarily waive copays or cost-sharing for that treatment.\nAnd there are other nuances to getting treatment that might entail higher cost-sharing. If a coronavirus diagnosis ultimately means a patient needs to be put in a private room, or some other form of isolation, that\u2019s a service that costs more. And even if it\u2019s covered, patients could end up paying part of the price out-of-pocket, Corlette said.\nFor surprise medical bills, it\u2019s trickier. There is a lot insurance plans can do, such as waiving in-network cost-sharing when someone gets treatment for the coronavirus, or agreeing to change their benefit structure if a patient gets care from someone out of network. But they don\u2019t appear to have explicitly committed to doing those things, Corlette said.\nAnd the responsibility for surprise billing doesn\u2019t just fall on insurance companies, said Zack Cooper, a health economist at Yale University, who studies surprise billing. Doctors and hospitals who are out-of-network are still able to balance bill \u2014 that is, send patients a bill for whatever insurance has not paid.\u00a0\nPlus, big insurance companies are only part of the picture. About 61% of Americans with employer-sponsored health care have what is called a \"self-insured\" plan. Those plans, which are regulated by federal law,\u00a0 can opt out of the agreements around copayments.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith all those caveats, Corlette said, Trump\u2019s assertion is \"misleading.\"\nWhat the insurance plans said\nThe statements released by health insurance companies about waived costs are not as comprehensive as Trump indicated.\u00a0\nUnitedHealthcare announced that it has \"waived all member cost sharing, including copays, coinsurance and deductibles, for COVID-19 diagnostic testing provided at approved locations in accordance with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for all commercial insured, Medicaid and Medicare members. UnitedHealthcare is also supporting self-insured customers choosing to implement similar actions.\"\nEthan Slavin, a spokesman for Aetna, gave a similar response: He said the company will waive associated costs for members who get tested \"at any authorized location.\"\nAnthem announced March 6 that it would provide coverage of the coronavirus screening test at no out-of-pocket-cost.\nBut again, those commitments are not comprehensive.\nThe statement by UnitedHealthcare doesn\u2019t state that they are waiving all cost-sharing with respect to all emergency treatment or post stabilization, for example.\n\"The only place you can get tested in a lot of communities is still the hospital emergency room department, so that\u2019s an emergency visit,\" said Sara Rosenbaum, a George Washington University professor of health law and policy.\nWhile the White House meeting shows that at the moment health insurance companies have agreed to not charge copays for the tests, the rules could change rapidly for other costs, said Thomas Miller, an expert on health care policy at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.\n\"Looking over the horizon we are going to be doing a lot of things differently,\" he said.\nJoseph Antos, another health care expert at AEI, said that since the final bills for treatment are settled after the patient has been treated, that allows negotiation or other consideration for patients who can\u2019t cover what could be very high cost-sharing amounts in full.\n\"Most higher income people with good insurance should be able to deal with those costs and should not expect additional discounts related to coronavirus,\" he said.\nIt\u2019s also possible that Congress will decide to pass surprise billing legislation given the circumstances.\nOur ruling\nTrump said the health insurance industry has \"agreed to waive all co-payments for coronavirus treatments.\"\nThis isn\u2019t what those companies said. They agreed to waive copayments for coronavirus testing. That\u2019s only one component, and it\u2019s a far cry from waiving copayments for all treatment. And, despite what the president\u2019s phrasing may imply, the Americans who seek a test and are turned away will not have their copayments waived either.\nPatients who seek testing for coronavirus, and even those who end up needing treatment, will likely still end up facing medical bills. The size and scope depends on their insurance plans, and on what doctors they see.\nThe president\u2019s statement is inaccurate. We rate it False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18106"}
