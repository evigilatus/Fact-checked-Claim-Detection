On August 25, Ojeda tweeted, \"If this is your measure of pretending we're the best you really need to know to be #1 in something that's not always a good thing.\" The attached chart contains a graph containing the following classifications: #1 in student loan debt #1 in prices of medicines #1 in cases of mass shooting #1 in prison population #1 in deaths of rifles #1 in cases of climate deprivation #1 in cases of oil consumption described in Facebook on 27 January 2021 in an article in Facebook that says that Joe Biden cancelled the Keystone pipeline because Warren Buffett \"gives $58 million\" to his campaign. If this is your measurement of the prosecution we'd better really need to know that being #1 in something isn't always a good thing. :: Pic.twitter.com/cFf1DupwSee - Richard N. Ojeda, II (@VoteOjeda2020) 25 August 2019 here, we will check whether the United States is \"#1 in world oil consumption,\" as international comparisons of data on oil use are more consistent than many other comparisons made by Ogeda. Ojeda told Polyte Fact West Virginia that he had found his information through Wikipedia. We've become original sources. Compared to total oil consumption, the United States ranks first in the world, according to the World Energy Statistical Review 2019, a comprehensive review of global energy data. In 2018, the United States consumed 20,456,000 barrels per day - much more than the second-class country, China, with 13,525,000 barrels per day. It should be noted, however, that the use of the total consumption figure is an incomplete method of measuring global oil consumption \"for two factors - high consumption and population size,\" said Anna Mikulska, a non-resident colleague at the Centre for Energy Studies at the Baker Public Policy Institute of Rice University. Because larger countries will normally have larger aggregates than smaller countries, it is also important to look at per capita consumption - consumption divided by population. With this measure, the United States is close to the top, but not quite so. 1. According to Ene, an Italian oil company, the United States ranked third internationally in per capita oil consumption. Saudi Arabia ranks first with 34.91 barrels per year, followed by Canada with 24.16 barrels and the United States with 23.12 barrels. Our reign Ojeda said that the United States is \"#1 in the consumption of oil\" in the world. This is true for total consumption, but in part because of the large population of the United States. On a per capita basis, the United States ranks third after Saudi Arabia and Canada. We're mostly evaluating the statement right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00106"}
