Ron Johnson largely unknown in Wisconsin, Democratic Party says", "text": "U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson was out and about in June 2014.\nThe Wisconsin Republican appeared on CNBC, on CNN and on a nationally syndicated radio talk show. He was quoted in the Huffington Post and in a Wall Street Journal blog, and featured in articles on national political websites such as Real Clear Politics and Salon. His name appeared in 10 articles and letters to the editor in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\nSo, Johnson, a political newcomer when he was elected in November 2010, is pretty high-profile, right?\nNot according to the Wisconsin Democratic Party.\nOn June 12, 2014, the party posted this on its Facebook page:\n\"He\u2019s been in office nearly four years now, but 40% of Wisconsinites don't know who Ron Johnson is.\"\nTotal exaggeration?\nNot totally.\nMarquette poll\nThe party cited as evidence a Marquette Law School Poll of registered voters in Wisconsin from March 2014, the most recent one to include such a question about Johnson.\nWe took a look at the script used by the poll takers. The seventh question was preceded by this statement:\n\"I\u2019m going to read you a list of people and organizations. Please tell me if you have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of each of them or if you haven't heard enough about (him/her) yet to have an opinion. The first name is Barack Obama.\"\nThe interviewer continued with the same question about several Wisconsin politicians, including Johnson and U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.).\nThe interviewer would record the answer as Favorable, Unfavorable, Haven\u2019t Heard Enough, Don\u2019t Know or Refused.\nThe figures for Johnson, as summarized in the results section of the poll data:\n\n\n\n\nFavorable\n\n\n29 percent\n\n\n\n\nUnfavorable\n\n\n27 percent\n\n\n\n\nNot Heard Enough\n\n\n40 percent\n\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t Know\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJake Tapper\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in remarks in a CNN broadcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second presidential impeachment of Donald Trump was \u201cthe most bipartisan impeachment in American history.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 percent\n\n\n\n\nRefused\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nSo, 40 percent said they didn\u2019t know Johnson well enough to have an opinion of him.\n(The 4 percent represented people who responded by saying don\u2019t know, rather than saying they didn\u2019t know enough to have an opinion.)\nIn comparison, 27 percent of those polled said they had not heard enough about Baldwin to have an opinion of her and another 3percent said they didn\u2019t know if they had an opinion. Baldwin was elected to the Senate two years after Johnson, but previously served 14 years in Congress and has gained national attention for being the first openly gay person elected to the Senate.\nIt\u2019s worth nothing that another Wisconsin poll also showed a relatively high percentage of residents weren\u2019t sure how they felt about Johnson. But it also did not ask respondents if they knew who Johnson is; rather, the question was about job approval. \u00a0\nIn the latest poll by the St. Norbert College Strategic Research Institute, done in late March and early April of 2014, the interviewer said: \"Now I\u2019d like to ask you about some major political figures and your opinion on how well they are doing their job. For each of the following, please tell me whether you strongly approve, approve, disapprove, or strongly disapprove with the way the person is doing their job.\"\nOn Johnson, 31 percent of the respondents said they weren\u2019t sure, compared to 21 percent for Baldwin.\nPerspective\nFor his part, Marquette poll director Charles Franklin told us there\u2019s no way to know from his poll what percentage of the respondents \"don\u2019t know who Johnson is.\"\nThat question was not asked.\nAt the same time, Franklin said, the favorable/unfavorable question used by the Marquette poll is good as a general measure of the public\u2019s awareness of, or familiarity with, a person. And the Democratic Party\u2019s claim about Johnson, he said, \"has a little bit of hyperbole, but it\u2019s not a wildly misleading reading\" of the results.\nWe checked with three other experts: David Wegge of the St. Norbert institute, which is based at St. Norbert University near Green Bay; and John Stevenson and Chad Kniss of the University of Wisconsin Survey Center, which does surveys for the UW community and other organizations and formerly did political polling for the Badger Poll. They agreed the Democratic Party's claim is not totally accurate, but not way off, either.\nIf you\u2019re surprised that 40 percent of the respondents didn\u2019t feel they had heard enough about a nearly four-year U.S. senator to have an opinion of him, Wegge noted that St. Norbert\u2019s Wisconsin surveys, which date back to 1984, show U.S. senators have less name recognition than governors. Senators are generally in the state less, get less Wisconsin media coverage and, of course, deal more with national than state issues, he said.\nIndeed, even near the end of Democrat Herb Kohl\u2019s 24 years in the U.S. Senate, many Wisconsinites said they didn\u2019t know enough about him to have an opinion, according to an April 2011 St. Norbert poll.\nMarquette\u2019s Franklin added: \"A lot of people are not so intensely engaged in politics that they follow these names day in and day out and form strong opinions about them outside of a campaign.\"\nThat was borne out in two polls taken in the weeks before Johnson was elected -- the vast majority of registered voters said they had an opinion when asked by Marist College if they had a favorable or unfavorable impression of Johnson. In late September 2010, only 19 percent said they were unsure of their opinion of Johnson or hadn\u2019t heard of him; by late October 2010, the figure was 18 percent.\nIt doesn't stand to reason that nearly four years after Johnson's election, 40 percent of Wisconsinites don't even know who he is.\nOur rating\nThe state Democratic Party said: \"He\u2019s been in office nearly four years now, but 40% of Wisconsinites don't know who Ron Johnson is.\"\nIn the most recent statewide poll that asked about Johnson, 40 percent of registered voters said they didn\u2019t know him well enough to have an opinion about him and another 4 percent said they didn\u2019t know if they had an opinion of him. But that falls short of evidence that 40 percent don't even know who he is.\nWe rate the claim Mostly False.\nTo comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel website.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07659"}
