Humongous. It's a humongous number. It's billions and billions of dollars -- far more than what we're talking about for the wall. The wall's peanuts compared to that.\"\nTrump\u2019s statement prompted these questions: What is the amount of the trade deficit and the cost to build the wall? Mostly importantly,\u00a0does a big trade deficit mean the Mexican government has money to\u00a0pay for a wall?\nThe Trump campaign did not respond for this fact-check.\nThe size of the trade deficit \nThe U.S.-Mexico trade deficit was $50 billion for 2014. It was about $54 billion for the first 11 months of 2015. That means Mexico sold the United States $54 billion more in goods and services than the United States sold to Mexico.\nBalanced trade -- in which exports and imports are equal -- is rare. The U.S. economy has run overall trade deficits in every year since 1976.\nSorting out the costs to build a wall is messier.\nCost of a border wall\nThe border with Mexico is about 1,900 miles. Federal law in 2006 required the construction of an approximately 700-mile fence.\nBorder fencing and associated costs added up to about $6 billion as of 2012.\n\"It\u2019s a lot more expensive than we expected when we started, and it was much more difficult,\" said\u00a0Ronald Vitiello, deputy chief of the U.S. Border Patrol for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, before a Senate committee in May.\nBut the costs have left Trump, who promised to \"build a great wall,\" undeterred. His immigration plan includes no price tag, although he wants to force Mexico to pay for it by taking money from remittances and jacking up fees on visas.\nNews reports estimating the price of a wall have varied widely. For the fence already built, the costs fluctuated depending upon the terrain. A Congressional Research Service report noted in 2009 that the challenges include \"costs versus benefits, location, design, environmental impact, potential diplomatic ramifications, and the costs of acquiring the land needed for construction.\"\nMedia reports we saw to complete such a wall ranged from $5.1 billion to $25 billion \u2014 plus additional costs to maintain it. \u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The only way to come up with any type of real cost estimate, you would have to do what we did: Get the Army Corps of Engineers or somebody else to survey and plan and come up with a fence type, and environmental impacts,\" said Thad Bingel, a senior official at Customs and Border Patrol during the George W. Bush administration.\nFrom an engineering standpoint, it\u2019s possible to do it. But the cost would be enormous, and it would be more efficient to invest in equipment or staff, he said.\n\"Largely the reason we didn\u2019t fence those portions was Border Patrol didn\u2019t think we needed fencing there,\" because those portions had a river, mountains or a lot of desert, Bingel said.\nTrade deficit has nothing to do with cost of the wall\nSo let\u2019s review what we know so far: The trade deficit is about $50 billion. It\u2019s difficult to pinpoint a price to build the wall, although the estimates we saw were smaller than the deficit.\nHowever, the bigger problem with Trump\u2019s statement is he suggested Mexico can afford to pay for the wall because of the amount of the trade deficit. There is no proof of that.\nSeveral experts told PolitiFact that there is no connection between the size of the trade deficit and finding money to build the wall.\n\"Trump\u2019s connection of the trade deficit with a Mexican border fence is just nonsense,\" said Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration expert at the libertarian Cato Institute. \"Just because the Mexican economy has a trade surplus relative to the United States doesn\u2019t mean the Mexican government has the resources to build a border wall. It would be like me threatening my neighbor to build a new fence or else I\u2019ll stop shopping at Walmart.\" \u00a0\u00a0\nMark Perry, a University of Michigan professor and scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said the trade deficit is based mostly on trading and investment by private individuals and companies -- not the government itself.\n\"It\u2019s not like there is $54 billion sitting around somewhere in Mexico, like a magic pile of dollars, that could be used to build a wall,\" he said.\nThe Mexican government does not have adequate funds to pay for health, education or roads -- much less build a wall, said Gary Hufbauer of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a think tank that analyzes globalization.\n\"The trade surplus does not represent money in some idle bank account controlled by the Mexican government,\" he said.\nOur ruling\nTrump said, \"When they say Mexico can't pay for the wall, I say of course they can. We have a trade deficit with Mexico that's unbelievably big. ... It's billions and billions of dollars -- far more than what we're talking about for the wall.\"\nThe trade deficit is about $50 billion. Estimates to build a wall vary widely, though the ones we saw were smaller than the trade deficit. It\u2019s impossible to know a precise figure because Trump hasn\u2019t offered a detailed plan.\nHowever, Trump\u2019s overall message here is misleading because he suggests that the size of the trade deficit is proof that Mexico could pay for the wall. In reality, the trade deficit has nothing to do with whether the Mexican government could afford to write the United States a check to build the wall.\nWe rate this statement False.\nUpdate: The original version of this fact-check used a paraphrase of Trump's statement as its ruling statement that was in error.\u00a0(It should have referred to Mexico's trade surplus with the U.S., not deficit.) We have replaced the ruling statement with his quote.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f6bed0f5-2644-466c-967e-84608377d04c", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05506"}
