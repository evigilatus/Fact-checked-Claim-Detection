At 53 percent, the unemployment rate for black males in the city would be nearly seven times that of the state overall.\n\nAsked about the statement, Pratt told PolitiFact Wisconsin a person he trusts told him shortly before the TV interview that the black male unemployment rate in Milwaukee was 52 percent. He then checked with that person and told us the figure -- actually 53 percent -- came from a report by University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee urban studies professor Marc Levine.\n\nIndeed, Von\u2019s statement and the Business Journal article also trace back to the same October 2010 report by Levine, who is a senior fellow at UWM\u2019s Center for Economic Development.\n\nBut the official unemployment rate in 2009 for black males in metro Milwaukee, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 33.3 percent.\n\nSo, what\u2019s going on here?\n\nThe difference is what is measured by the federal government\u2019s official unemployment rate and what Levine terms the \"jobless rate.\"\n\nFederal approach\n\nThe federal government defines the unemployed as people over age 16 who do not have a job but are available for work and have actively looked for work in the prior four weeks. That is, people out of work and looking for a job.\n\nThe unemployment rate is not calculated by using the number of people who file claims for unemployment insurance benefits, but is based on responses to the government\u2019s monthly surveys of some 110,000 people across the country.\n\nIn the Milwaukee metropolitan area, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics figures, the overall unemployment rate for 2009 was measured as 9.4 percent. When broken down, the rate for black males -- 33.3 percent -- exceeded the rate of 7.9 percent for white males and 11.2 percent for Hispanic males.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevine's approach\n\nLevine\u2019s approach counts people who are out of work and looking for a job -- and nearly everyone else.\n\nHe looks at everyone between the ages of 16 and 64, including those who choose not to work, such as homemakers and early retirees, and those who cannot work, such as those behind bars or with disabilities. It also includes those in high school or college -- even those going back to school for more education to get a better job.\n\nLevine\u2019s report focuses strictly on male \"joblessness.\" His approach puts the metro Milwaukee \"jobless\" rate for white males at 22.3 percent and 32 percent for Hispanic males. Like African-American males, those come in higher than the official numbers.\n\nLevine argues that the same approach is used by scholars such as Harvard University\u2019s William Julius Wilson. He says it is better because the official rate understates the number of people not working -- the federal measure does not include the long-term unemployed who have stopped looking for jobs.\n\nBut Levine\u2019s approach, which he began using in 1990, overstates the number. Indeed, with his approach the rate could never reach zero -- a point he concedes in the report.\n\nLevine\u2019s approach has been controversial even within UWM.\n\nIn December 2009, UWM\u2019s Employment and Training Institute criticized the 2009 version of Levine\u2019s joblessness report for what it said was his \"misuse of the \u2018jobless\u2019 statistic as a proxy for unemployment.\" \u00a0\n\nAccording to the institute, Levine\u2019s report counted 88 percent of 16- to 19-year-old metro Milwaukee black males as jobless, even though most of them were enrolled in school.\n\nIn response, Levine issued a 14-page rejoinder in which he quoted the sections of his studies that explain the differences between his jobless rate and the unemployment rate.\n\nWhat do others say?\n\n\nLaura Dresser, associate director of the Center on Wisconsin Strategy at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said Levine\u2019s jobless rate includes unemployed people who are no longer in the work force. But it doesn\u2019t tell how many of those people choose not to work or are incapable of working, she said.\n\n\n\nKai Filion, a policy analyst with the Economics Policy Institute, a Washington, D.C., think tank, said Levine\u2019s measure has greater value during a recession because it includes discouraged workers who have stopped looking for jobs. But it is wrong for anyone to portray the jobless rate as the unemployment rate, Filion said.\n\n\nYet that is what has happened, repeatedly, with those citing Levine\u2019s report.\n\nThe result is a distorted view of a serious problem -- one being tackled most recently by the African-American Male Unemployment Task Force, created in 2010 by the Milwaukee Common Council.\n\nLet\u2019s bring our work to an end.\n\nIn his effort to catalog Milwaukee\u2019s woes, former Acting Mayor Marvin Pratt said the city\u2019s unemployment rate among black males tops 50 percent. Pratt said he was relating the finding of a recent UWM study. But that study uses a broader \"joblessness\" measure than the conventional unemployment rate, and looks at the full metropolitan area, not just the city. As such, Pratt falls into a trap others have before him -- stating one measure as another. We rate the statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-14000"}
