Proponents argue that this requirement is necessary to prevent the impersonation of voters. This debate is taking place in North Carolina, where legislators are drafting a bill aimed at satisfying voters who, in a referendum in November, approved the concept of photo identity with 55 per cent support. Republican legislators passed the Photographic Identity Act several years ago, but it was dropped in 2016 by judges who said that the law was aimed at suppressing minority voters. In November 27, the Republicans presented the latest version of the identity proposal that will enter into force next year. At the committee meeting, Sun, the state. Terry Van Doen said it would be very quick to begin implementation. :: Van Duyen, a Democrat from Buncumbe County in Western North Carolina, referred to the 2016 primary stage - when the old Photoidism Act was applied. \"With three years of public education, more than 1,000 people were denied voting on election day. This seems like a very aggressive schedule. \"That sounds a little unbelievable, Van Dwayne said in November 27. Was there 1,000 people \"not voting\" in 2016? The statements of the Electoral Council contacted by Politi Vac, Van Duyen (proclaimed as \"Van Din\") cited the PowerPoint presentation in Legislative Committee No. 26 by Kim Strach, Executive Director of the Government Electoral and Ethics Enforcement Council. The jacket explained to the Committee that the National Convention Election Council had spent more than $2 million to raise awareness of the 2013 voter identity card law, which had subsequently been dropped by judges. The money went about 400,000 posters and leaflets, as well as television, radio and online advertising. :: Van Duyen: Despite the State &apos; s awareness-raising efforts, some potential voters have not yet understood or complied with the voter identification law during the 2016 primary stage. If you look at the second slide of the last slide, (Strach) says that 1,200 voters +, for a number of identity-related reasons, were unable to vote. Some have been offered provisional ballots, but they have not been counted.\" Van Duyen said in an e-mail. The slide indicates that: 1,248 voters did not present an acceptable picture of the identity, implemented a declaration of reasonable disability, or returned to the district office on the deadline after election night. These votes were not counted. They were offered provisional ballot papers, which are conditional ballots, which are counted only after confirmation of the voter &apos; s status. The Van Duyen e-statement that \"some have been offered provisional ballot papers\" means that some have not been offered provisional ballots - which is inaccurate. On January 26, 2021, in the North Carolina tweet, Secretary of State Ellen Marshall, Jenna Woodsworth stated, \"She has won state-wide races more than anyone else is likely to be alive.\" \u2022 On 1 February 2021, according to Josh Lawson, the general adviser to the Election and Ethics Committee of the National Council, provisional ballot papers were presented to all 1,248 voters referred to in the e-mail. \"rat workers are required to present an opportunity for a provisional vote to any voter who is not listed in the ballot books, lacks identification or appears not to meet the requirements,\" said Lawson in an e-mail to Polyte Fact. \"Our numbers were compiled using data on provisional voting requests, so all these voters were presented with the provisional ballot papers,\" said Lawson. \"We do not have aggregate data on individuals who may have left the polling place without attempting to vote temporarily.\" What does \"consequential obstruction\" mean? Under the old law, voters made an announcement to the National Convention Election Boards if they were unable to obtain a photographic identity card for any of the following reasons: - lack of transportation. Disability or illness. - Failure to obtain a birth certificate or other documentation necessary for obtaining an identity card with a photograph. Table of work. Family responsibilities - Lost or stolen photo ID. - The request for the identification of voters by video means, but the voters did not receive it in person. PowerPoint says that 1,048 voters completed the \"reasonable impediment\" model and that 864 of these were eventually counted. As for \"return to the District Office,\" the 2013 draft law allowed people who did not bring an accepted identity card to the ballot box to submit a valid ballot card \"to the District Electoral Council (no) no later than 12:00 of the day before the date set for the holding of the election.\" Therefore, the 1,248 voters whose votes had not been counted could have legitimized their provisional ballots by presenting a valid identity card to their Provincial Electoral Council later. But they didn't. Our governor, Van Duyen, said \"more than 1,000 people were rejected on election day\" in 2016. She has the view that more than a thousand people appeared to vote and that their votes were ultimately not counted. However, her claim gave the impression that potential voters had been rejected by election workers, and that was not the case. They have been offered provisional ballots and have not taken the necessary steps to count them. Her claim in the Committee is partly accurate but leaves important details or takes matters outside the context, so we evaluate it in half right.
