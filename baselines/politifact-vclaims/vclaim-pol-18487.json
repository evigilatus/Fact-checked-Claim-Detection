And then flips off the ballot. And then crumples it up. If that\u2019s not voter fraud, I don\u2019t know what is.\"\nThe man in the video, appearing somewhat agitated as he works, crumples up a piece of paper with one hand and puts it into a bin on a desk next to him.\nThe response\nRichard Barron, the elections director in Fulton County, Ga., said on Nov. 6 that his office reviewed the video and found it shows a worker handling absentee ballots in a ballot processing area inside State Farm Arena in Atlanta. The worker\u2019s job was to use a cutter to open envelopes containing ballots. The ballot processing was done at another station in the facility.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.
