It did not specify any certain municipality and therefore is factually accurate,\" he wrote.\nAccording to the American Civil Liberties Union's website, 22 states and the District of Columbia prohibit employment discrimination based on sexual orientation. The District and 19 states also ban discrimination based on gender identity. That makes Florida\u00a0one of 28 states with no statewide protection against discrimination.\nOur ruling\nAiken tweeted, \"A gay man who survived #orlando hate crime can STILL show up to work in FL tomorrow and have his boss fire him simply because he is gay.\"\nThat is generally true across the state, because gays and lesbians lack protection from employment discrimination under state law and under federal law.\u00a0However, 19 Florida\u00a0cities often offer protection to gay workers, including the city of Orlando. Another 10 counties also offer protections.\nWe rate Aiken\u2019s statement Mostly True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7e41f675-9288-4071-bbb7-5510906aa369", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04810"}
