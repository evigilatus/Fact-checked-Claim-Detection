Clarke Jr.\u2019s own words to suggest he\u2019s encouraging gun violence by discouraging use of the 911 emergency response system.\n\"I don\u2019t dial 911,\" Clarke says in a clip featured in the ad. \"I will afterwards, to say \u2018Come get this dead guy out of my house, he\u2019s bleeding out and he\u2019s messing up my carpet.\u2019\"\nThe ad ends with another excerpt from that interview: \"Point that barrel (at) center mass and pull the trigger.\"\nAt the top of the spot, a narrator says: \"Emergency responders. They risk their lives every day to help save ours. But Sheriff David Clarke says 911 is not our best option.\"\nDoes the new ad, paid for by the union-backed Greater Wisconsin Committee, accurately reflect Clarke\u2019s views?\nSpecifically, has Clarke advised citizens to \"point that barrel center mass and pull the trigger\" because \"911 is not our best option?\"\nA familiar controversy\nClarke faces Milwaukee Police lieutenant Chris Moews in the Democratic primary for sheriff on Aug. 12, 2014.\nThe new ad resurrects a controversy that began in January 2013 when Clarke\u2019s office paid for a radio announcement in which he said: \"With officers laid off and furloughed, simply calling 911 and waiting is no longer your best option. You can beg for mercy from a violent criminal, hide under the bed, or you can fight back. But are you prepared?\"\nThat prompted a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story with this online headline: \"Sheriff David Clarke\u2019s radio ad says 911 not best option, urges residents to take firearms classes.\"\nAfter Clarke\u2019s radio spot, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett criticized him, saying if there\u2019s an emergency, \"I want people to call 911\" but Sheriff Clarke is \"discouraging people from calling 911, it\u2019s just wrong.\"\nAbout six weeks later, Clarke sat for a long interview with Project Veritas, a conservative group. that posted it online. The snippets of Clarke speaking in the Greater Wisconsin ad are from this interview.\nIn that interview, Clarke said that Barrett had \"contorted\" the message in his radio spot by suggesting that he was advising that nobody call 911.\nThe sheriff explained that it\u2019s up to individual citizens to decide for themselves what they will do when confronted with possible harm.\nAt the same time, Clarke made it clear not only what he personally would do, but what he would advise as the best course of action for citizens.\nHe spoke in the context of potentially immediate danger, an example being an intruder breaking into your home.\nTwice he said the \"advice\" he would give people was based on what he himself would do:\n\"Use cover, because you don\u2019t know if that clown trying to break into your house is armed. Know who and what your target is. Point that barrel center mass and pull the trigger.\"\nHe does not mention calling 911 in that sequence.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in remarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen he concludes: \"You see, the thing is 911 in that situation is not going to help you and that\u2019s why I said it\u2019s not your best option.\"\nSo the ad, notably, gets the \"not your best option\" context right.\nThe other Clarke quote in the Greater Wisconsin Committee ad is from a section of the Project Veritas interview in which Clarke talks more about what he personally would do in that situation.\nClarke tells the interviewer that a sign hangs on his own home picturing the head of a Rottweiler and a semiautomatic handgun with the message: \"We don\u2019t dial 911.\"\n\"I don\u2019t call 911,\" Clarke explained. \"I will afterwards, to say \u2018Come get this dead guy out of my house, he\u2019s bleeding out and he\u2019s messing up my carpet. And that\u2019s not to sound, you know \u2026 that\u2019s just the reality. I\u2019m not going to fool around with that. But that\u2019s the mindset I have but I\u2019ve been a cop for 35 years, so I live with that every day and it becomes second nature...\"\nThe sheriff, at that point in the interview, shifts back to what he\u2019d like law abiding residents to consider doing. Government shouldn\u2019t tell them what to do, he said.\n\"I trust them to make those decisions as to what to do,\" Clarke said. \"If they want to blow a whistle, fine, I don\u2019t tell them not to.\"\nBut he made clear that he feels the best option is not waiting around for the police, or hiding under the bed, or running away.\n\"I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be very effective in some of these situations,\" Clarke said. \"So I want people to think about what\u2019s going to be effective. If you want to run out of your house, fine, I\u2019m not running out of my house unless it\u2019s on fire. That\u2019s my house, and I\u2019m not running from it to give the bad guy carte blanche.\"\nAd vs. reality\nSo how does the Greater Wisconsin ad compare to Clarke\u2019s statements?\nThe ad, despite the length limitations, gets Clarke\u2019s message right and places it in the context -- using Clarke\u2019s own words -- of a home invasion situation.\nNeither Clarke nor the ad is saying the sheriff suggests that calling 911 is never a good idea. (Clarke, in the interview, at one point seems to suggest he wants average citizens to call 911 if they can -- but then take matters into their own hands rather than wait for police to arrive).\nThe other Clarke quote in the ad -- \"point the barrel center mass and pull the trigger\" -- is in fact Clarke\u2019s advice to citizens. He says a 911 call isn\u2019t \u00a0always possible and by itself isn\u2019t effective because of long wait times for police.\nWhen we asked Clarke to respond to the ad, he said he stands behind what he said to Project Veritas and did not intend to watch the Greater Wisconsin ad.\nClarke said he suspected the ad twisted his remarks, but he couldn\u2019t recall the specific context of his comments in the interview cited in the ad, and he offered no specific criticisms.\n\"My position is clear,\" Clarke said.\nOur rating\nA Greater Wisconsin Committee ad said Sheriff David Clarke advised citizens to \"point that barrel center mass and pull the trigger\" because \"911 is not our best option.\"\nClarke did just that in an interview, and made similar comments in an earlier radio spot and in comments to PolitiFact Wisconsin.\nWe rate the claim True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07480"}
