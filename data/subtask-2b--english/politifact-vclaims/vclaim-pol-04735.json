She savaged their dignity and shamed them.\"\nThe video attributes several quotations to Hillary Clinton, which we\u2019ll explore later. We fact checked each individually to see if any\u00a0were taken out of context.\nBut before that, there\u2019s some history you need to understand.\nAccusations\nThe Washington Post published a guide to Bill Clinton\u2019s alleged impropriety, dividing claims against him into alleged consensual acts and alleged harassment or assault.\nFive women have alleged consensual affairs, and three others harassment or assault, according to the Post.\nBill Clinton has not been found guilty in any court of the accusations. \u00a0Sources other than the Washington Post \u2014 such as the conservative website\u00a0Breitbart \u2014 have higher numbers on how many women Clinton allegedly assaulted or harassed.\nThe pro-Trump video does not name specific women, and a spokesperson for the super PAC declined to go into more detail. Experts we reached out to had opposing views on both the ad\u2019s overarching message and on the substance of the alleged incidents. We\u00a0didn't weigh in on those issues.\u00a0\nWhat we could fact-check, however, was whether the ad accurately depicted Hillary Clinton\u2019s quotes. Let\u2019s go one by one.\nThe \u2018Cosby\u2019 tweet\nThe ad says, \"When Bill Cosby was accused of sexual assault, Mrs. Clinton tweeted, \u2018Every survivor of sexual assault deserves to be believe.\u2019 \"\nThe ad initially references a Nov. 22, 2015, Hillary Clinton tweet on sexual assault. The text of the tweet is accurate. She made similar claims at a rally two weeks later, adding that survivors ought to be believed until \"disbelieved\" by evidence.\nBut the tweet is not easily identifiable as a direct reference to Cosby.\nThe tweet itself links to Clinton\u2019s plans to tackle sexual assault in college. This might not be a coincidence \u2014 CNN aired a version of a documentary on campus assault the same day.\nThe Cosby allegations were in the news at the time, although we were unable to find any specific Cosby-related incident that day. The closest was on Nov. 13, when four women joined a defamation lawsuit against the comedian.\nNo evidence from the tweet itself, however, directly suggests she responded to Cosby.\n\u2018Loony toon\u2019\nThe ad, turning to allegations against Bill Clinton, said Hillary Clinton called\u00a0her husband\u2019s accusers\u00a0\"loony toon.\"\nThe \"loony toon\" comment comes from the diaries of Diane Blair, a former University of Arkansas professor and friend of the Clintons. According to those notes, Hillary Clinton referred to Monica Lewinsky \u2014 whom the Post lists as a consensual affair\u00a0\u2014 as a \"narcissistic loony toon.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe citation is correctly attributed to Blair\u2019s diaries. The accuracy of what Blair wrote is impossible to determine.\nThe ad claims Clinton was referring to sexual assault accusers, but she was speaking of only one woman \u2014 Lewinsky. \u00a0Experts had differing takes on whether the \"Lewinsky affair\" was consensual or not.\n\u2018Floozy, bimbo and stalker\u2019\nThe ad says \"The Clinton effort used words like \u2018floozy, bimbo and stalker.' \" Note, it does not say Clinton said these words \u2014 which she didn't.\u00a0\nThe terms are found in a book \u2014 Target: Caught in the Crosshairs of Bill and Hillary Clinton \u2014 by Kathleen Willey, a woman who accused Bill Clinton of groping her. The language is also found in a New York Times article.\nIn the book, Willey writes that Robert Bennett \u2014 Bill Clinton\u2019s former lawyer \u2014 referred to her in conversations with CBS producers as a \"floozy, bimbo flake.\" The book attributes the \"stalker\" remark to Sidney Blumenthal \u2014 a former White House aide \u2014 speaking with author Christopher Hitchens.\nThe quotations do come from an identifiable source, but again it is impossible to determine whether the quotes themselves are accurate.\n\u2018A lot to answer for\u2019\nThe ad claims that referring to the women, Hillary Clinton said \"some folks are going to have a lot to answer for.\"\nThe comment comes from a Today show interview with Matt Lauer on Jan. 27, 1998, soon after news of the Lewinsky affair broke. Lauer asks Clinton about her role defending her husband.\n\"The great story here for anybody willing to find it and write about it and explain it is this vast right-wing conspiracy that has been conspiring against my husband since the day he announced for president,\" Clinton said.\nShe goes on to note prior attempts to shut down her husband\u2019s political aspirations, eventually declaring the allegations are \"not going to be proven true.\"\n\"And I think that when all of this is put into context, and we really look at the people involved here, look at their motivations and look at their backgrounds, look at their past behavior, some folks are going to have a lot to answer for,\" she said.\nThis could be interpreted as targeting the women making the accusations, but alternatively it could also be targeting various \"right-wing\" political operatives based on the interview\u2019s prior context.\nThe Washington Post\u2019s Fact Checker, which previously looked into the ad, noted the ambiguity. A spokesman for the pro-Trump PAC acknowledged it as well, but found their interpretation plausible based on books alleging Clinton mistreated female accusers.\nThe ad claims Clinton was questioning the accounts of the women involved. Going back to the source, that is not certain.\nThe Clinton camp declined to go on record for this fact-check.\nOur ruling\nA pro-Trump advertisement makes several claims about Hillary Clinton\u2019s hypocritical treatment of women, relying primarily on her own words or those of close confidants.\nThe broader message \u2014 that Clinton enabled her husband\u2019s alleged sexual assaults \u2014 has been and continues to be debated, by pundits and experts alike.\nWe didn't weigh in on those arguments,\u00a0but we did look into the ad\u2019s more specific use of quotes attributed to Clinton. The quotes themselves are hearsay in some cases and subject to different interpretations based on context.\nThe ad further misleads by saying Hillary Clinton \"savaged\" the dignity of people who accused Bill Clinton of sexual harassment or assault \"and shamed them.\"\nWe rate this claim Mostly False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/26258019-ded0-4ed2-aec3-33d9bb6b14d6", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04735"}
