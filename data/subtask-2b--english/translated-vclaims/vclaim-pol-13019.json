He quotes Ibrahim Lincoln as evidence. In an interview with the \"Sentinel\" newspaper on 18 May 2011, the Monona Democratic Party, which led the exit process, repeated a novel that had been conducting several months of tours of various media accounts of the battle against the Government of the Republic. Scott Walker moved to reduce collective bargaining. \"When we were in Illinois, we learned that Abraham Lincoln jumped out of a window in the Illinois legislature to deny a quorum,\" said Miller. \"So we felt that in that case we were certainly in good company.\" Trying to deny a quorum sounds familiar. But is this true or just Lincoln's legend? Some of the details we heard made us wonder. Many novels, even in some famous Lincoln biography, claim Lincoln jumped from the second story. Now, we're well aware of Lincoln's length, but, really, couldn't the injury have been caused by such a leap? No injuries were reported. Many calculations refer to Lincoln jumping out of the state Capitol building that day, December 5, 1840. But historians noticed that the new capitol wouldn't open until days later. What is the truth? We found numerous references in books and newspapers to Lincoln's desperate attempt to prevent a vote on a banking bill, including an account in David Herbert Donald's Paulitzer Award-winning autobiography (1995). Lincoln, a defender of the strong central banking system, was trying to save the Illinois State Bank. Donald called the \"second story\" a job in the Capitol Building. Lincoln himself later gave a short speech about his \"jump\" when, according to historians, the Legislature reconvened in January 1841, citing legislative documents. We located the Illinois State Register that day in the legislature. The reporter of Springfield Lincoln said \"Unofficially lift a window\" and jumped through. His account started at 11, 1840 -- less than a week after the accident itself. So, we didn't find any real disagreement about the outline of what happened. But let's settle some details. We moved to the co-author of one of Donald &apos; s books, who died in 2009, on his behalf: Wayne Temple, Deputy Director of the Archives of the State of Illinois in Springfield. The book of a temple is \"The Fifth Capital of Illinois: The House that Lincoln built and caused to be rebuilt.\" Temple personally checked newspaper accounts and legislative minutes from the 1840s. It happened. Temple told us. \"This is the story, and I have done it from basic sources.\" The seminar had already taken place in a church that operated as a temporary legislative chamber. The new capital building of Illinois will not be opened until two days later. How does Temple know? He said, \"I have records to show which church was paid for.\" The tour guides at the Capitol sometimes tell the visitors wrong that Lincoln jumped out of there, as Temple said. \"If he had jumped from there he would have killed himself,\" he said. Temple said his escape was from the first floor, not the second floor. Lincoln and his Wiggs were already present and voting before they opened the window and jumped out, many accounts appeared. So maybe Lincoln was trying to obstruct the quorum, but he failed. \"It was for nothing!\" He said, \"Tempel.\" In Donald's novel, Wigg was away for many hours, leaving Lincoln and a few lieutenants behind to observe the proceedings. But they made a procedural mistake that required their rapid exit. The Democrats made fun of Lincoln and his flying brothers, Donald wrote, noting that \"his famous jump didn't cause him any harm because his legs almost got from the window to the ground.\" Senators of Wisconsin 14 eventually failed to stop voting, too, but stayed away for 22 days, allowing massive protests to develop in Madison. He said, \"Lincoln didn't leave the state -- he didn't even leave the square.\" \"The arm sergeant could have gotten it from the neck bomb and pulled it back.\" Wisconsin has experienced her share of moves to overcome the quorum over the years, according to a coloured historical novel in the State of Wisconsin. In one episode, the newspaper stated that it included the Republic, Ruth Doyle, mother of the former Goof Government. Jim Doyle refused to leave the ladies' powder room where she escaped to avoid voting on a resolution asking General Douglas MacArthur to address the state legislature. Let's get this back to the present. In the summer of 2011, senatorial elections will help write history's view of the troubled battle over collective bargaining rights in Wisconsin. It is too early to predict the outcome now. But let history record that media accounts in 2011 correctly recorded that Abby Lincoln and Wiggs tried to disrupt the quorum in 1840 by staying away. The future president left through the window. It was a failed attempt, so it's a bad comparison with the Wisconsin ring in February 2011. But Miller heard it right. \u2219 (Ib) Honest, Sadiq.
