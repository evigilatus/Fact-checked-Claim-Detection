Here, we\u2019ll fact-check an ad that targets Democratic Rep. Nick Rahall of West Virginia. In a separate item, we\u2019ll fact-check an ad attacking Democratic Rep. John Barrow of Georgia.\nRahall, first elected in 1976, represents a district that gave Republican Mitt Romney a whopping 32-point margin of victory over Obama in the 2012 presidential election. It ranks as the second-most Republican district currently represented by a Democrat in the House, making it a prime takeover opportunity for the GOP. (The most Republican district held by a Democrat is the Utah seat occupied by retiring Rep. Jim Matheson.)\nRahall faces state Sen. Evan Jenkins in November, in a race analysts say is one of the most vulnerable seats held by the Democrats.\nThe ad against Rahall features a constituent, Carrie Overby of Huntington, W.Va. She says, \"On the issues that have mattered, Nick Rahall has voted with Barack Obama, whether it's spending, cap-and-trade, EPA regulations, Obamacare.\"\nWhen she says that, text on the screen says, \"Nick Rahall voted with Obama 94 percent of the time.\" In much smaller type, the ad footnotes this claim to \"Congressional Quarterly 2009 vote analysis.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince data from 2009 would now be five years old, we had a hunch that the NRCC might have ignored a couple of years with lower percentages. It turns out we were right.\nData from the same CQ study shows that Rahall voted with Obama 88 percent of the time in 2010, 65 percent in 2011, 64 percent in 2012 and 58 percent in 2013. (Data for 2014 has not yet been posted.)\nThat\u2019s not as low as Barrow, who was targeted in the companion ad; Barrow\u2019s score dropped as low as 28 percent in 2012. Still, it shows a degree of voting independence by Rahall that\u2019s not reflected in the NRCC ad. Clearly, the 94 percent figure for voting with Obama was a more attractive one for the NRCC to highlight, but it amounts to cherry-picking.\nAsked to justify using the five-year-old data and ignoring later figures, NRCC spokesman Ian Prior said, \"It is important for West Virginia voters to know that in 2009, when the Democrats controlled all the levers of government and could push legislation through both chambers of Congress, Nick Rahall voted with Barack Obama 94 percent of the time, including on Obama\u2019s budget, which included a cap-and-trade plan and a $3 billion, 37 percent\u00a0EPA funding increase to advance his climate agenda.\"\nOur ruling\nThe NRCC ad said, \"Nick Rahall voted with Obama 94 percent of the time.\"\nRahall did indeed vote with Obama 94 percent of the time -- but that was in 2009, a fact that is footnoted in the ad, albeit in small type. Between 2010 and 2013, Rahall\u2019s voting record was less closely aligned with Obama, bottoming out at 58 percent in 2013, the most recent year for which data is available. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, so we rate it Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07304"}
