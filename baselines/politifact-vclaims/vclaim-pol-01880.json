Its June 30 headline read, \"Justice Kennedy quit because he and his son helped Trump launder illegal Russian money through Deutsche Bank.\"\nThe New York Times report didn\u2019t go that far, so we decided to dig deeper into the Kwotable claim.\nDeutsche Bank and Trump\nTrump\u2019s relationship with Deutsche Bank began in the late nineties when many other major lenders were unwilling to do business with him. Between 1991 and 1992, Trump declared bankruptcy four times, making him unpopular among Wall Street bankers, who referred to making deals with him as \"Donald risk.\"\nDeutsche Bank opened up to working with Trump after launching its real estate division in 1998. Mike Offit, a newly-hired managing director, gave Trump a loan to renovate his building on Wall Street, and continued to work with him through the 2008 financial crisis.\nAccording to a 2017 report by the New York Times, Trump has done more than $4 billion in business with Deutsche since then, including the construction of Trump Tower in Chicago and the Trump National Doral in Miami.\nJustin Kennedy began working at Deutsche in 1998 as the managing director and global head of Real Estate Capital Markets, a role he held until leaving in 2009. Kennedy oversaw and approved major real estate loans given through the bank, including multiple loans made to Trump for his real estate enterprise.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHogan Gidley\n\n\nstated on January 17, 2021 in a Fox News interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump \u201ccan\u2019t say anything (about the U.S. Capitol riot) because the platforms have removed him.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 18, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat about Russia?\nTrump\u2019s connections to Russia are still being investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller. But Deutsche Bank\u2019s relationship to the country is well-documented, and controversial.\nIn early 2017, banking regulators fined the bank $630 million for its negligence in stopping a Russia-based money laundering scheme, in which Russian clients engaged in illegal \"mirror-trading.\" (One client would purchase stocks in rubles through the Moscow branch, and then a conspirator would sell identical stocks for the same price, but through the London branch and in dollars. This money would be transferred to offshore accounts, effectively allowing traders to illegally transfer billions of dollars out of Russia. According to Reuters, this scheme began in 2011.)\nBetween 2010 and 2014, the bank was also involved in the \"Global Laundromat\" scandal, which allowed over $20 billion to be funneled from Russia to other countries around the world. The Global Laundromat was a much larger operation than the mirror-trading. It involved top Russian oligarchs and criminals\u00a0\u2014\u00a0including Igor Putin, cousin of President Vladimir Putin.\nThe bank\u2019s name has come up in the Mueller investigation as well, but not in the way the Kwotable article makes you think. In December 2017, Mueller\u2019s team subpoenaed Deutsche Bank records connected with former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who had been indicted in October on suspicion of money laundering, among other crimes.\nHowever, there has been no evidence to date that Trump himself was involved with any of the money laundering \u2014 or that either Kennedy was involved.\nDemocrats have called for more transparency in Trump\u2019s banking history,\u00a0but the bank has denied their requests, citing confidentiality concerns. The records would be released only in the event of a formal investigation.\nAs for Justin Kennedy, he left Deutsche Bank in 2009, before investigators say the Global Laundromat or mirror-trading scandals began. He has not been formally investigated or accused of involvement in financial foul play.\nKennedy and Deutsche Bank declined to comment for this story.\nOur ruling\nBloggers wrote that Justice Kennedy retired last week because \"he and his son helped launder illegal Russian money through Deutsche Bank.\"\nThis story has all the buzz words to make a good conspiracy theory: Russia, real estate, billions of dollars, coincidence, corruption. But there is no evidence that Trump and Justin Kennedy ever had a relationship beyond Trump\u2019s real estate loans.\nThere is also no evidence that Kennedy was involved in Russian money laundering, as he left the bank before either of the major scandals happened, or that the Trump White House was blackmailing his father because of it.\nWe rate this claim False.\n Share the Facts 2018-07-10 18:14:30 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  \"Justice Kennedy quit because he and his son helped Trump launder illegal Russian money through Deutsche Bank.\"    Bloggers kwotable.com https://kwotable.com/2018/06/30/justice-kennedy-quit-because-he-and-his-son-helped-trump-launder-illegal-russian-money-through-deutsche-bank/   in a blog Saturday, June 30, 2018 2018-06-30    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01880"}
