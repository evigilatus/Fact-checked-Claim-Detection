That makes us feel useful. So we were pleased at the beginning to read in the arguments against a new registration fee for the Silowood Bridge car this comment from President John Lee of Clacamas County: \"The study that says that more than 70% of the traffic on the bridge from/to Clacamas is more than 10 years and has been completely dismantled by Oregon.\" Measure 3.372 for those who do not follow the news of the department of Klakamas would increase the state &apos; s vehicle registration by $5 per year for the provincial population. The money, about $22 million, goes towards replacing the dilapidated Silowood Bridge, which is in the neighbouring province of Multenomah but is used by residents of the department of Klakamas. A large part of the bridge used by these people has played a pivotal role in the campaign. Proponents prefer to cite the May 1999 study of crossing the South Willamette River conducted by Metro, which shows that about 70% of 30,000 trips across the bridge each day originates or ends in the department of Klakamas. The opponents of the measure argue that the study is dated and in fact say nothing of this kind. This is where Paulette Vack Oregon comes in. First, we looked for the study and on page 5, we found the relevant chart. The pie shows that 50 per cent of the flights on the bridge are between the department of Clacamas and Portland; 13 per cent of the flights are between Clacamas and Washington; and 7 per cent of the flights are between the east and west of the department of Clacamas. That adds 70% of the trips either end or start in the Clacamas county. But wait, here's the rest of the pie: 17% of the flights between the East and West Sides of Portland, and 13% of the trips between Portland and Washington County. So the graph also indicates that 80% of flights end or begin in Portland. Both percentages were included in a 16 February story by Yuksing Zing, Clacamas County Correspondent, Oregon State. So it turns out that she added some context from the study -- but it's very difficult to say that Oregonian \"bone\" anything. \"We didn't untie her at all,\" she said, \"because it's actually true.\" We now recognize that the 1999 study is old, with traffic figures based on 1994 travel. So we looked for more recent figures and found this: a half-up version of the 1999 study with traffic projections for 2030. This version projected 76 per cent of flights starting or ending in the department of Klakamas, with only 9 per cent of flights within the province. Flights that end or begin in the province of Moltenomah will account for 79 per cent of journeys. (This total is more than 100 per cent because flights can start or end in either district.) We talked to Lee about this, and we liked his honesty in an e-mail. He wrote: \"My statement that Oregon had \"done the study instead of more than 70% of the traffic in Klakamas may have been better formulated,\" adding that he was really excited in previous media reports that described the residents of the Klakamas province as doing 70% of the bridge's journeys, which is not quite accurate. For example, the Oregonian editorial and news story was published in February 2010 on the report of the Portland City Club, which inaccurately stated that the drivers of the department of Klakamas would represent three times the number of trips through the Silwood Bridge as drivers in the department of Moltenomah. In the March story, Oregon corrected this figure when the City Club issued a correction; the March story also stated that 79 per cent of traffic would start or end in Multenomah Province, and 76 per cent would start or end in Klakamas Province. \"The impression given to the voters is that the residents of Klakamas use the Silowood Bridge more than anyone else so they must pay for its replacement\" wrote to me. We're sympathizing with the head of JOP County. It is frustrating when the statistics are so incomplete that they are inaccurate. But we have to object to his claim that the Oregonians have dismantled a study that claimed that \"more than 70% of the journeys end or begin in the province of Clacamas.\" The March 2010 story simply corrected one figure - withdrawn by the city club itself - and added a context. We're assessing the statement wrong. On September 15, 2010, in a statement on the campaign website, a bill by Earl Bloominauer would \"take control of GPS tracking devices on all our vehicles.\" \u2022 24 September 2010, comment on this item.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13133"}
