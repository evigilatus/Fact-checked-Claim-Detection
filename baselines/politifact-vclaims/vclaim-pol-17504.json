Recovering addicts spent days cleaning nine tons of garbage and thousands of heroin needles from their former home, a patch of woods behind a Home Depot south of Everett.\"\nWhile the photo is miscaptioned, it is true that San Francisco and other large cities continue to experience problems of homelessness and drug abuse.\nNevertheless, the image is not from a San Francisco park. It was taken at a homeless camp in Washington as part of a six-month project, and the needles were displayed to demonstrate the opioid crisis in the community.\nThis photo is mislabeled and missing context.
