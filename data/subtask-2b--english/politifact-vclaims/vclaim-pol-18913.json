Gretchen Whitmer meeting with Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden to wrongly accuse the politicians of double standards on COVID-19.\u00a0\nThe photo was taken in March, before the first cases of COVID-19 emerged in Michigan. But the angry posts make the event seem a lot more recent.\n\"While OUR children are being mandated to wear a mask while playing outdoor sports these hypocrites are at the Detroit Athletic Club yesterday maskless!\" reads the description of an image that shows Biden and Whitmer standing in close proximity to other people and not wearing masks. \"When will the sheeple wake up! This is ALL about control and it has to STOP.\"\n\"At the DAC in Detroit?,\" one account sharing the image said. \"Where are their F#king Masks when the cameras are off? Whitmer and Biden you are pieces of and full of S---! EVERYONE REPOST THIS ASAP!\"\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Jim Blanchard, Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan and Detroit businessman Dennis Archer Jr.,\" the Detroit Free Press reported.\nThis was before the first case of COVID-19 was identified in Michigan, and well before the state required people to wear face coverings.\nOn March 10, the state\u2019s department of health and human services identified the first two presumptive-positive COVID-19 cases in Michigan. Whitmer declared an emergency.\u00a0\nThe Athletic Club shut down on March 16.\u00a0\nOn April 24, more than a month after Biden\u2019s campaign rally, Whitmer signed an executive order requiring people to wear face coverings in enclosed public spaces.\u00a0\u00a0\nOn Sept. 9, the same day that Archer posted the fundraiser photo from March, Whitmer signed an executive order requiring face coverings be worn by \"athletes training for, practicing for, or competing in organized sports when the athlete cannot maintain 6 feet of social distance, except for occasional and fleeting moments.\" The order doesn\u2019t apply to swimmers and athletes playing professional sports.\u00a0\nWe rate this Facebook post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18913"}
