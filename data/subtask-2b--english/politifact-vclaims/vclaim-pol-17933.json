Horse girls are supposed to love horses, not misinformation. But it\u2019s perhaps a big-hearted penchant for ponies that has led us to this moment: social media users indiscriminately amplifying a post that wrongly claims dozens of horses need to be saved from imminent death.\u00a0\n\"ANYONE WITH A FARM WANT FREE HORSES,\" begins a message that is being widely shared on Facebook. \"FREE HORSES!!!! 52 thoroughbred horses need homes. Will go to Sugarcreek this Sat. for slaughter. Gentleman died due to COVID-19 and his son wants nothing to do with them. Most broodmares are broke and some are in foal weanling, yearlings, 2 yrs. and 3 yrs. old most are gelded. FREE and papered. Friend of the deceased is trying to find homes. (XXX) XXX-XXXX in Texas.

Other versions of the message are appearing on Facebook with the same promise of 52 thoroughbred horses who need homes but with different phone numbers and locations. This one claims they\u2019re in Fairhill, Md. In 2012, a version of this post claimed the horses were in the United Kingdom.\u00a0\nYes, 2012! Well before the coronavirus pandemic. COVID-19 didn\u2019t exist when Snopes fact-checked what was already an out-of-date plea about the horses that originated after a longtime horse breeder in Ohio died in January 2011.
