In his meeting with CBS News, Senator Vermont was asked if his plan was too big for the country to deal with. Sanders replied that ensuring universal access to health care did not seem to be beyond the reach of other developed countries. He referred to the North American neighbour. \"In one way or another in Canada, for several decades, they gave good care to all people without spending their own money,\" said Sanders on February 19. \"You go to cancer therapy, you don't take your wallet. And they do it at about 50% per capita of the cost we spend.\" Let's focus on those costs from our own money. In Canada, if you actually go to the hospital and get treatment there, it's free. All over the country, 100 per cent of hospital visits and care are covered in the doctor &apos; s office. However, prescription drugs and some external care are a completely different issue. Canada has costs of private funds, and while they are lower than in the United States, they can be significant. Canada &apos; s health care system: It is the short version that equips anyone who has lived legally in Canada for a sufficient period, whether or not he is a citizen, to obtain coverage. Most provinces and territories of Canada are responsible for this. The national programme they call medical care met about 60 years ago and basically established the rules of the day under which the federal government would help cover costs and set a minimum level of basic services to be covered by the provinces and territories. History is important. Six decades ago, health care meant to a large extent going to the hospital and seeing a doctor. The medicines prescribed by outside patients were not a significant part of the health care that people receive. Architects have ensured that hospital and doctor care is free, but today prescription drugs - in addition to dental, visual, rehabilitation and other services - fall outside the basic package. For those other services, where the provinces and territories are in the driver &apos; s seat, what is covered and what is not is different from place to place. Medical care for all: what it is, what it is not, while a large share of spending on health care comes through the government, The public sector covers about 70 per cent of the total, and private sources, including private insurance, represent the remaining 30 per cent. Some of the latter is from his own pocket. The Government of Canada reported that in 2018, about 36 billion Canadian dollars, or 15 per cent, of all health-care spending was from its own funds. The Sanders campaign said he was talking about covered care, not all care necessarily, and his proposal was different from the Canadian system. The cancer treatment in Sanders' specific example of access to cancer treatment, and the difference from place to place makes things unexpected. The diagnostics and processes are clearly covered, and the chemotherapy will be so, as long as it takes place in the hospital. Some drug treatment systems may occur as inpatient care in a hospital. But others can be treated outside the hospital in another jurisdiction, as said by Raisa Deber, Professor of Public Health at the University of Toronto. If this happens, the patient may rely either on a separate insurance policy if he or she has an insurance policy, or pay himself or herself. A 2011 study in three provinces found that for the most common cancers - breasts, colon, lungs and prostate - the average patient bore about $200 in monthly costs from his own funds. However, the scope was considerable. For example, some breast cancer patients reported zero costs while others reported more than $5,200. On January 13, 2021, the distinguished fact-checkers announced in a story in which General David H. Berger, the commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Pelosi's request for the use of marines to provide security, and said to her, \"We are not working for you.\" By Samantha Buterman: January 17, 2021, cancer drugs, along with all other prescribed medicines, constitute a point of contention in Canada today. Canadians are discussing prescription drugs as much as we do in the United States. \"Some people say it's really stupid not to pay for prescription drugs,\" said Deber. \"The others agree, but argue that we should not do things that are not medically necessary. There is tension between helping people pay their bills and giving unexpected profits to pharmaceutical companies.\" :: Solid data on the pressures people face are limited. A recent survey found that 2.5 per cent, about 137,000 Canadians, said they had to borrow money to cover the costs of drugs. One of the challenges is to achieve a full picture that each province and territory sets its own rules for coverage. \"In Quebec and Ontario, the cost of people is almost zero\" for prescription drugs, said Ted Marmor, a professor of public policy and public administration at Yale University. \"But other provinces, such as Manitoba and Saskatchewan, focus on specific groups, mainly the poor and the elderly.\" In 2017, spending on medicines far exceeded any change in the cost of hospitals and doctors as a share of total spending on health care. Although many Canadians receive supplementary insurance through their jobs, many do not. Some people fall through the cracks. The family doctor and assistant professor at the University of Toronto and Andrew Pozari said: \"The working poor have been excluded from the class.\" \"It appears that 10 to 20 per cent of Canadians do not have drug coverage.\" Canada has achieved some success by using price controls to reduce the high cost of medicines. In general, Deber said, \"It is unlikely that you will be bankrupt, especially since doctors keep the option of getting patients to hospital, where their drugs will be fully covered.\" With regard to health care in general, the costs incurred by Canadians are lower than those incurred by Americans. In a comparison between apples and trailers for 2016, Canada's per capita cost was $690, while the United States was $1,103. Our rule, Sanders, said, \"In Canada, over a number of decades they have provided good care to all people without spending their own money. You go to cancer therapy, you don't take your wallet.\" As long as care comes from a doctor or hospital, the Canadian system covers the full cost. However, the country &apos; s general insurance does not automatically pay for all services and, more importantly, prescribed medicines, including those needed to control cancer. Private spending accounted for about 15 per cent of all Canadian health-care expenditures, and researchers said prescription drugs were probably the largest share. The financial burden on people is not nearly as widespread or severe as in the United States, but Sanders made it seem as if the costs of their own funds were not an issue in Canada. We're assessing this claim half right.
