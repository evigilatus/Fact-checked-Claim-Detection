The first shots were given to frontline health care workers on Dec. 14.\nContrary to what the Facebook posts say, Pfizer\u2019s vaccine has not been shown to cause death. Other fact-checkers have debunked rumors of nurses dying after taking the vaccine.\nWe reached out to the users who published the Facebook posts for their evidence.

The vaccine was not found to cause death in any of the 43,448 participants in clinical trials ranging from April to December.\nRELATED:\u00a0Why you shouldn\u2019t worry about getting Bell\u2019s Palsy from the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine\nThe FDA\u2019s emergency-use authorization stipulates that Pfizer must report COVID-19 cases that result in death and \"serious adverse events\" to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, which is co-managed by the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\"I can confirm that as of 4 p.m. ET today that VAERS has received no reports of death after COVID-19 vaccines,\" CDC spokesperson Kristen Nordlund said in a Dec. 16 email.\nThe Facebook posts are inaccurate.
