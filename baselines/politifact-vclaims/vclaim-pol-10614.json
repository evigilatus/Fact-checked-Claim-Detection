Bill Nelson for cutting billions from Medicare by voting for the Affordable Care Act. The ad is getting plenty of airplay, despite PolitiFact repeatedly finding the ad\u2019s claims untrue. \u00a0(We swear, our feelings aren\u2019t hurt.)\n\nSo what exactly is wrong with the claim in American Commitment\u2019s commercial this time?\n\nIn the ad, which is titled \"Facts,\" a narrator intones that \"Nelson\u2019s health care vote imposes the largest tax increase in history on the middle class, cuts $500 billion from Medicare to pay for new government programs, and millions could lose their current coverage.\"\n\nAmerican Commitment told PolitiFact they refused to work with us, citing previous Truth-O-Meter rulings with which they didn\u2019t agree. Nelson\u2019s lawyers in May asked Florida television stations to not air a commercial from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce that made similar claims. The stations refused.\n\nFor this item, we\u2019ll skip the tax increase claim (which we\u2019ve called Pants on Fire) or the loss of coverage (which we\u2019ve called False), but will focus on the $500 billion in cuts.\n\nThis is a standard conservative talking point after the passage of the president\u2019s health care bill, focusing on a $500 billion reduction in projected spending that is an integral part of the federal health care law. These reductions include the amount of annual increases health care providers would receive from Medicare, administrative changes and alterations to Medicare Advantage.\n\nThe difference, PolitiFact has repeatedly ruled, is that these don\u2019t represent cuts, but rather an attempt to curtail future Medicare spending. The program is still projected to grow, the Congressional Budget Office predicts, just at a slower rate under the so-called Obamacare guidelines.\n\nThose savings, which the commercial says are being taken to fund \"other government programs,\" are alterations to the way health coverage is paid for. One of those ways is to increase the scope of Medicaid. Another is to expand coverage of prevention services. A third is to help cover the Medicare Part D \"doughnut hole\" for prescription drugs.\n\nNelson was among the 60 votes in favor of the bill on Dec. 24, 2009, providing the cloture needed to prevent the bill from being filibustered. That has drawn the ire of the bill\u2019s opponents and conservative groups like American Commitment, which have charged all 59 Democrats and Vermont Independent Bernie Sanders all cast the \"deciding vote\" -- yet another claim we\u2019ve ruled False, because several other senators\u2019 votes were much more crucial.\n\n The ruling\n\nAmerican Commitment claims Bill Nelson voted to slash $500 billion from Medicare to fund other programs. Our previous rulings have shown that there is no vast well of money already allocated that is being cut, and the programs being funded are a part of government health care services, of which Medicare is the largest.\n\nYet again, we rate this claim as Mostly False.\n\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocratic Congressional Campaign Committee\n\n\nstated on August 20, 2011 in a gas station advertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Congressman Bill Young voted to cut taxes for millionaires and end your Medicare.\"\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Becky Bowers \u2022 September 7, 2011", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10614"}
