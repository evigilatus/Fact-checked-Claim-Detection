Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., that West Virginia has \"more veterans per capita\" than any state. We rated that False, because 2016 data showed that West Virginia\u2019s per capita\u00a0veteran population\u00a0ranked only 14th among the states.\nJustice\u2019s reference to \"one of the greatest percentages\" leaves him a bit more wiggle room. We looked for the most recent data available to see if his phrasing was accurate. (His office did not respond to inquiries for this article.)\nWe looked at data published by the Department of Veterans Affairs on the number of veterans in each state in 2018. We then used 2018 population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau to determine how big a share\u00a0veterans constituted in each state.\u00a0\nHere are the top 10 states for veterans as a percentage of population for 2018:\n1. Alaska: 9.96%\n2. Montana: 8.70%\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoe Manchin\n\n\nstated on September 16, 2018 in remarks at a teachers' rally\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWest Virginia has \"more veterans per capita\" than any state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Emily Martin \u2022 October 11, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.

Alabama: 7.64%\nWe believe that ranking seventh out of 50 states qualifies as having one of the largest percentages of veterans in the country.\nOur ruling\nJustice said, \"West Virginia has one of the greatest percentages of veterans in any state.\"\nJustice phrased his statement carefully \u2014 and accurately. The most recent data available, from 2018, shows that 7.98% of West Virginians are veterans, ranking it seventh among the 50 states.\nWe rate the statement True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18701"}
