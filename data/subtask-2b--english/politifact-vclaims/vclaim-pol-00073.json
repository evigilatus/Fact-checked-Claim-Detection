Teachers in Chicago Public Schools are paid some of the highest compensation of any school system in the country.\"\nThe city\u2019s offer to increase teacher pay by 16% over five years, Lightfoot added, is \"a good deal.\"\n\nThe city\u2019s last contract with the Chicago Teachers Union expired in June, and the district\u2019s 25,000 teachers and support staff have set an Oct. 17 strike date if a deal isn\u2019t hammered out by then.\nIs Lightfoot correct that teachers in Chicago are already among the nation\u2019s highest paid? We decided to find out.\nA dearth of data\nUnder the most recent contract, the district\u2019s base salary for a new teacher with a bachelor\u2019s degree is just under $53,000. The maximum salary a teacher can earn in CPS after years of experience and with higher credentials is a little more than $101,000. That\u2019s before the value of required annual pension contributions the district makes on a teacher\u2019s behalf.\nIn response to our inquiry, a spokesperson for Lightfoot\u2019s office provided a spreadsheet comparing CPS teacher salaries at different levels in their careers with those in districts in the nation\u2019s 10 other largest cities, and pointed us to some state-level salary data.\nBut Lightfoot didn\u2019t limit her comparison to what teachers make in other large cities, so we went looking for more comprehensive data to assess her sweeping claim.\nNone of the sources we found allow for a direct comparison of overall teacher compensation \u2014 not just salary, but pension and health care benefits \u2014 across all districts nationally.\nHowever, figures compiled by the National Council on Teacher Quality, a nonpartisan policy and research center, make it possible to compare teacher salaries at various levels of education and experience among the nation\u2019s 124 largest districts.\nDuring the 2017-2018 school year, the latest year for which the group has updated figures, Chicago ranked 22nd out of 124 for its starting salary. The survey adjusted for cost of living using a measure developed by the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChicago\u2019s ranking improved for teachers with more years of teaching and higher education credentials, according to the center\u2019s analysis. For example, a teacher with a master\u2019s degree and 10 years of job experience made more under Chicago\u2019s salary schedule than their counterparts in all but two of the districts included in the group\u2019s database.\nEven so, Lightfoot didn\u2019t constrain her remarks to the nation\u2019s 100-plus largest districts either. And salary schedules are different than the average compensation a teacher in a given district actually receives.\n\"A salary schedule really doesn\u2019t tell you what the reality is on the ground,\" said Robert Bruno, a labor expert at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, adding that it doesn\u2019t say how many teachers are actually making that pay. \"It says contractually, this is where people would be if they\u2019re at this level.\"\nSo we turned to data obtained by the Better Government Association through an open records request to the Illinois State Board of Education to see how Chicago stacked up within state lines. (The Better Government Association runs PolitiFact Illinois.)\nThe short answer: Not so well.\nChicago Public Schools came out 109th of the state\u2019s more than 800 school districts based on average teacher pay alone. Including bonuses, health and pension benefits, its ranking rose somewhat. But it still trailed 34 other districts, many of them located in the more affluent suburbs outside Chicago and in the surrounding collar counties.\nBen Ost, an economist at the University of Illinois at Chicago, told us it\u2019s likely CPS trails districts in similar suburbs throughout the nation as well.\nOur ruling\nLightfoot said Chicago Public School teachers are \"paid some of the highest compensation of any school system in the country.\"\nData from teacher salary schedules compiled by the National Council on Teacher Quality shows Chicago ranks 22nd among the nation\u2019s 124 largest districts for starting salary. Its ranking also nears the top of the list for teachers with more years of experience and higher degrees.\nBut Lightfoot didn\u2019t limit her remarks to larger districts, nor to salary. So we turned to Illinois data, which shows CPS ranks well outside the top 20 for average teacher compensation in its own state.\nWe rate Lightfoot\u2019s claim Mostly False.\n\nMOSTLY FALSE \u2013 The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00073"}
