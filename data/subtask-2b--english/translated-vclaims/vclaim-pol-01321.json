It's not. \"Hunters Attention: Voting in North Dakota can cost you your fishing licences outside the state,\" says Facebook ad, which started on Nov 1. We ran the ad by Cameron Wembie, Director of Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Election Data and Science Laboratory. \"I certainly think it's the repression of voters to try to fool people this way,\" said Wimpy. Most North Dakota hunters can easily breathe. If you have a fishing licence from outside the state anywhere outside North Dakota -- a licence from outside the state, instead of a residence permit for the residents of that state -- you're safe. If you have a residential fishing licence in North Dakota, you are also safe, because in applying for such a permit you have already relinquished any other residential permit. The Game and Fish Department of North Dakota does not allow a person to carry two residence permits. \u2219 (Swims to end within a season or a year in any case.) In theory, this applies to people living in North Dakota who have a residence permit in the state of other than North Dakota, which can be imagined to be the people who just moved. This is the basis for the non-partisan party of the North Dakota Democratic League, the State branch of the Democratic Party, to defend the Declaration. Did the vote in North Dakota even make those permits empty? We didn't find any evidence of that. We contacted fish and wildlife offices in the states adjacent to North Dakota: Montana, Wyoming, South Dakota, Minnesota. They told us all that voting in North Dakota would not make them lose their licences. On January 18, 2021, in an interview with the right national radio program, \"China was behind intervention and effort to overthrow our government and elections, electoral fraud.\" \"If they buy that licence before leaving Montana as a legal resident, it is valid until the expiry date, regardless of what they do in North Dakota,\" said Ron Gendero, Assistant Chief of Enforcement of the Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks Department. The same applies to Wyoming, South Dakota and Minnesota; licences are valid until they expire. For other states, the determination of residence elsewhere means that their fishing licence is invalid. This is the case in North Dakota and Kentucky, the other two states that we contacted with their fishing permit offices. But it is impossible to make this licence suddenly invalid. The Electoral Specialist in the Office of the North Dakota Foreign Minister, Lee Anne Oliver, told us that they had a central voter file, but the fish and wildlife administrations could not access that database. In any event, in order to vote, a person must have already established residence. Oliver said, \"They put the cart before the horse.\" \"You must be a resident before you can vote.\" Voters can show a North Dakota driver &apos; s licence, a non-driver &apos; s identity card, a tribal identity card or a long-term care card. If these documents do not contain a housing address in North Dakota or their date of birth, the voter may supplement their identities with a variety of documents, such as invoices or bank statements. North Dakota Democratic - NPL said to us: \"Founded hunters: voting in North Dakota can cost you fishing licences outside the state.\" This is difficult to explain in any way but seeks to discourage people from voting. However, voting will not cost anyone their fishing licences. Persons with fishing licences outside the state retain their licences; the warning applies only to persons with residence permits in another state who have recently moved to North Dakota. The voting will not make this null and void, but the establishment of residence in another state, which is a precondition for voting, may, according to the mandate. The ad uses a ridiculous argument.
