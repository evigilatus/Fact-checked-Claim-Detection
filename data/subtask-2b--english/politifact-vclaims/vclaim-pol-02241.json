Michael McCaul, R-Austin, told Karina Kling on the March 26, 2018, edition of Spectrum News\u2019 Capital Tonight: \"He\u2019s a sociopath. He claims I\u2019ve been a psychopath all my life. You know, 1 in 100 people are sociopaths. They have no remorse or conscience or guilt when they commit acts of murder like in this case. So he had no remorse.\"\nA sociopath, per Merriam-Webster, is someone who behaves in a dangerous or violent way toward other people and doesn\u2019t feel guilty about such behavior.\nAnd that describes 1 in 100 of us?\nA note: Our inquiries about McCaul\u2019s claim led us to recognize that experts don\u2019t necessarily use the word \"sociopath.\" For instance, the American Psychiatric Association responded to our inquiry about sociopaths by pointing out diagnostic criteria for \"antisocial personality disorder.\" The disorder\u2019s essential feature is a \"pervasive pattern of disregard for, and violation of, the rights of others that begins in childhood or early adolescence and continues into adulthood,\" according to the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. The manual further says its prevalence has been found to range from 0.2 percent to 3.3 percent.\nMcCaul cites FBI article\nBut Lizzie Litzow of McCaul\u2019s office told us by email that McCaul had relied on research into another disorder as described in a 2012 article in the FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin titled \"Psychopathy.\" That word, the article says, \"refers to a personality disorder that includes a cluster of interpersonal, affective, lifestyle and antisocial traits and behaviors.\" The article continues: \"These involve deception; manipulation; irresponsibility; impulsivity; stimulation seeking; poor behavioral controls; shallow affect; lack of empathy, guilt, or remorse; sexual promiscuity; callous disregard for the rights of others; and unethical and antisocial behaviors.\n\"Psychopathy,\" the article goes on, \"is the most dangerous of the personality disorders.\"\nAmong indicators, the article says, is \"a profound lack of remorse for their aggressive actions, both violent and nonviolent, along with a corresponding lack of empathy for their victims. This central psychopathic concept enables them to act in a cold-blooded manner, using those around them as pawns to achieve goals and satisfy needs and desires, whether sexual, financial, physical, or emotional. Most psychopaths are grandiose, selfish sensation seekers who lack a moral compass\u2014a conscience\u2014and go through life taking what they want. They do not accept responsibility for their actions and find a way to shift the blame to someone or something else.\"\nTo McCaul\u2019s point, the article says it\u2019s estimated that \"approximately 1 percent of the general male population are psychopaths, and 15 to 20 percent of the prison population are psychopathic.\"\nPsychopathy checklist\nThat \"1 percent\" statement, we noticed, is footnoted to an article by psychologist Robert D. Hare, who invented and then refined a heralded diagnostic assessment of psychopathy dubbed the Hare Psychopathy Checklist. Items gauged by an expert using the checklist include a subject\u2019s glibness/superficial charm; egocentricity; lack of remorse or guilt; parasitic lifestyle; and impulsivity. As summed up in another researcher\u2019s 2016 article, Hare\u2019s scale \"amalgamated many of the traits and behaviors of psychopathy using conceptual and statistical methods to provide for a more objective and dimensional assessment of psychopathy in criminal populations.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe read the chapter noted by McCaul\u2019s aide via the University of Texas library catalog and learned that Hare\u2019s 1-in-100 statement lacked certainty. Hare wrote: \"In spite of their small numbers--perhaps 1% of the general population--they constitute a significant proportion of our prison populations and are responsible for a markedly disproportionate amount of serious crime, violence, and social distress.\"\nNext, we reached Hare, a professor emeritus at the University of British Columbia. He advised by email that many years ago he\u2019d offered the 1 percent estimate as an informed guess -- and it held up in subsequent studies. Still, he stressed, such calculations rest in deciding what score on the checklist scale demonstrates that a person is a psychopath--and researcher judgments vary. As measured, Hare elaborated, \"psychopathy is dimensional and not a diagnostic category. So, about all we can say is that around 1% of the male population would receive a score of 30\" on the extended exam or a score of 18 on a shorter version.\nHare also told us he doesn\u2019t use \"sociopath\" when he\u2019s talking about psychopaths. Sociopaths, he suggested, are capable of feeling remorse or guilt. Hare later said by phone he\u2019s unaware of surveys gauging the prevalence of sociopaths but he\u2019d expect the percentage to be \"fairly high.\"\nOther experts\nWe also heard back from Scott Lilienfeld, an Emory University psychology professor. Lilienfeld said by email that the oft-cited 1 percent figure, rooted in research employing Hare\u2019s checklist, \"may be defensible, although it is also oversimplified.\" He also pointed out a 2013 Emory University breakdown of misconceptions about psychopathic personalities including, it says, the idea that a person with psychopathy poses more than a modest risk of heightened violence.\n\"Evidence suggests,\" Lilienfeld told us, \"that psychopathy isn\u2019t an either-or phenomenon; instead, it is continuously distributed, much like height and weight. So there is no scientific cut-off for distinguishing psychopaths from non-psychopaths. As a result, the 1 percent figure isn\u2019t exactly wrong, but it\u2019s somewhat misleading because it implies that 1 in 100 people are somewhat different in kind \u2013 rather than in degree - from the rest of us. Instead, psychopathy blends imperceptibly into normality,\" Lilienfeld said.\nSumming up, Lilienfeld called the 1-in-100 statistic informative in that it indicates \"that a nontrivial proportion of people walking among us are markedly elevated on traits such as superficial charm, social dominance, self-centeredness, dishonesty, manipulativeness, callousness, poor impulse control, and casual sexual relationships,\" he wrote.\nAlso to our inquiry, John Petrila of the Dallas-based Meadows Mental Health Policy Institute pointed out a 2009 study, by researchers including Hare, that gauged the general prevalence of psychopathy. According to the study\u2019s abstract, the researchers concluded -- after using Hare\u2019s checklist to screen 638 individuals aged 16 to 74 in England, Wales and Scotland -- that \"psychopathy is rare, affecting less than 1% of the household population, although it is prevalent among prisoners, homeless persons and psychiatric admissions.\"\nBy email, Petrila also noted a 2015 study that says in its abstract that \"psychopathy is almost exclusively investigated within criminal populations so that its prevalence in the general population has been inferred by psychopathic traits rather than disorder (1%).\" That study takes note of a 2011 study by researchers at the Queensland Institute of Technology, in Australia, that had 300 members of the general population complete a self-reported version of the psychopathy checklist and undertake a test of deception qualities. \"Results indicated that at least 1% of the current community displayed characteristics consistent with psychopathic tendencies,\" the study\u2019s abstract says, with \"younger males who tend to misuse alcohol\" found most likely to have the tendencies.\nOur ruling\nMcCaul said 1 in 100 people are sociopaths.\nMental health experts steer clear of \"sociopath\" to characterize individuals who don\u2019t show remorse, among antisocial qualities. Still, research suggests that about 1 percent of the population consists of psychopaths though it\u2019s also worth clarifying that such judgments are reached on a scale.\nWe rate this claim Mostly True.\n\nMOSTLY TRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.
