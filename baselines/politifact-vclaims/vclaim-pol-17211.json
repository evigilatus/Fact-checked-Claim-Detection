It was the third night of unrest after a Kenosha police officer shot Jacob Blake, a 29-year-old Black man, seven times in the back at close range. Rittenhouse has been charged with homicide and remains in Illinois awaiting further legal proceedings.\nOn Aug. 28, 2020, Facebook user Doug McLean shared a photo and connected it to the night of the deadly shooting. It has since drawn more than 800 shares and, in its various iterations, scores of comments.\u00a0\nIn the picture, a white woman is shown wearing fatigues with a long gun strapped to her chest.\n\"How did Kyle Rittenhouse cross state lines to Wisconsin? His mom, pictured below drove him. #KyleRittenhouse\u2019s mom Wendy, photographed on same night her son killed two people and shot another,\" McLean wrote.\u00a0\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

That release says Rittenhouse had stayed in Kenosha for the night after finishing work as a community lifeguard.\nBut there\u2019s a bigger problem with the photo that was shared: It\u2019s not even from the same day.\nOr the same city.\nLet\u2019s dig in.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin LeMahieu\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a TV interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It takes quite a while on Election Day to load those ballots, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto is from a related protest in Madison a few days earlier\u00a0\nThe woman with the long gun actually appears in a photo in a separate city, on a different day. The image was cropped in the Facebook post in question to focus on her.\nFacebook user Miki Pope shared the original photo, in which the woman stands with a group of other similarly armed people outside the Wisconsin state Capitol in Madison, where protests also occurred after Blake was shot by police.\u00a0\n\"Last night (Aug 24) in Madison, these counter-protesters showed up with long guns,\" Pope wrote in the early morning hours of Aug. 26, 2020.\u00a0\nPope\u2019s post references the violence Rittenhouse is charged with in Kenosha, but does not in any way tie him to the people in the photo aside from decrying the actions of such militia members that have been showing up at various protests.\u00a0\n\"I'm afraid this won't be the last shooting, as armed white supremacists are becoming more and more public about their hatred for Black lives and the Black Lives Matter protests,\" Pope wrote.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s unknown whether Rittenhouse\u2019s mother had any involvement in bringing her son to Kenosha that day \u2014 but the photo does not depict anyone who was there.\u00a0\nAnd, as noted, Rittenhouse\u2019s attorney says the teen was in Kenosha already and stayed there into the night hours.\nOur ruling\u00a0\nA Facebook user claimed that a photo of a white woman with a gun was the mother of Kyle Rittenhouse.\u00a0\nBut the photo is not from that protest. It\u2019s cropped from a larger image of a handful of people with guns standing outside the state capitol in Madison two days earlier.\nWe rate the claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17211"}
