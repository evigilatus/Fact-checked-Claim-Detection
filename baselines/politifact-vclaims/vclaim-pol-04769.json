(The federal government is prohibited from directing states to adopt or not adopt the standards.)\nThe Trump campaign didn\u2019t return emails seeking comment, but the candidate has mentioned student loan debt and the rising cost of college on a few occasions.\nIn a 22-second Twitter video from last year, Trump called student loan debt a \"tremendous problem,\" but he only made a vague promise to \"restructure\" it and make college more affordable.\nTrump also indirectly addressed rising student loan debt during a question-and-answer session with students at Simpson College in Iowa, acknowledging it as a \"huge problem\" but identifying job creation and \"great leadership\" as ways to fix the problem.\nBut other than a handful of interviews, Trump hasn\u2019t described how exactly he\u2019d make college more affordable.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a far cry from 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who in May 2012 released a 35-page white paper in part detailing his plans to reshape higher education policy. And 2008 GOP nominee John McCain also proposed several specific higher education policy changes on his campaign website.\nTrump\u2019s likely Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, has spoken at length about her plans for higher education. She released her \"New College Compact\" plan in August 2015.\nThe closest thing the Trump campaign has to a \"higher education plan\" was revealed in a Inside Higher Ed interview with Trump\u2019s national co-chairman and policy director, Sam Clovis.\nClovis said a Trump administration would focus on overhauling the student loan system by transitioning the responsibility for lending from the government to private banks, and floated the idea of basing loan eligibility on which majors college students pick.\n\"If you are going to study 16th century French art, more power to you. I support the arts,\" Clovis said in a May interview. \"But you are not going to get a job.\"\nSo Trump\u2019s closest thing to a higher education \"plan\" is returning to a system where private banks, not the federal government, would extend loans to students while requiring colleges to have more \"skin in the game.\"\nAs PolitiFact has previously reported, the federal government in 1965 took several steps to help more students attend college, including guaranteeing loans against default and promising a set interest rate to banks extending the loans to students.\nThat changed in 2010, when Democrats approved a new law cutting out the bank subsidies and replacing them with direct loans overseen by federal agencies and funded by the U.S. Treasury.\nHigh-profile critics like Trump and Sen. Elizabeth Warren. D-Mass., have panned the change as generating profit on the backs of over-burdened college students, but it\u2019s not clear that a shift to the old system or Trump\u2019s proposal would make college cheaper.\nOur ruling\nNevada Democratic Party chair Roberta Lange says Donald Trump \"literally has no plans to make higher education more affordable.\"\nTrump hasn\u2019t released any sort of traditional higher education reform plan \u2014 much less any details on how to make college more affordable \u2014 unlike\u00a0Clinton, Romney and McCain. However,\u00a0Trump has commented several times on the spiraling cost of student loan debt and said he doesn\u2019t want the federal government making a profit on the backs of students.\nFor Trump's\u00a0lack of specifics, we rate Lange's statement\u00a0Mostly True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/27d63b91-1b90-4ea9-9023-82f0ee09ff46", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04769"}
