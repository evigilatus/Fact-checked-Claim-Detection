Scott Walker returned to a subject that was consistent in his career. Tax cuts. In a new television commercial, the Republican Governor's first-time peers in the camera announce: \"Thanks for our reforms, the regular family will have an extra $322 for its tunnel.\" And then Walker asks, \"What are you gonna do with your savings?\" There is a series of people who regularly appear to respond enthusiastically: buying clothes and school supplies, buying 96 gallons of gas, new truck wheels, and 2,700 diapers. The Burke criticized the tax cuts that Walker had imposed as pro-rich. We've evaluated half of her claim that Walker reduced taxes to the richest people and raised taxes on 140,000 Wisconsin families. This allegation left important information, i.e. Walker also reduced income taxes in all areas. So, what about Walker's claim for $322 as savings for a \"medium family.\" When we asked Walker Tom Evenson to support the figure of $322, he referred to a series of income tax cuts, real estate tax exemption policies developed by Walker and GoP legislators. Evenson said the figure was based on \"average family,\" with four people and an average family income of $81,000. The time frame for the claimed savings was the 2014 tax year. The United States census figures show that the four-member family in Wisconsin has an average income of this amount, or slightly higher. A family of four is a common measuring stick. About one in five households in Wisconsin is this size. However, according to the Census Bureau, the two-person family is much more common, and almost half of these families are. There are also households with three more people than households with four people. In particular, we found that average income across all family sizes in Wisconsin is lower than what Walker used -- $65.618. Because it is a broader number, it can be said that it is a more representative income \"average family.\" \"To find a typical tax reduction for the Wisconsin family model, No. 65.618 will be the income figure for use, said Tamarin Cornelius, an analyst in the Wisconsin budget project, a programme at the Wisconsin Council for Children and Families. Let's see how it's done in both scenarios. We will divide our accounts into two main parts: property taxes and income taxes. Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" \u2022 On 26 January 2021, special injections of State property tax relief in the form of subsidies for schools and technical colleges helped to reduce the property tax bill against a medium-value home tax at average state prices. This assumption, the \"average\" owner of real estate will see a decrease of $151 in the Property Tax Act 2014 compared to what they would have received without mitigation measures, according to estimates from the non-partisan budget secretary, the Legislative Tax Office. At the middle-income level, not every family sees these savings. First, not every family has a home or property. While the tax office's estimate is widely cited by both parties as an example of changes in property taxes across the State, the minimum tax changes can vary significantly depending on a variety of factors at the municipal level. :: Income taxes using Walker &apos; s \"Medium Family\" income figure of $81,000, the income tax cuts enacted under Walker &apos; s rule would exceed $200 in 2014, based on its reading of the Bureau &apos; s tax analysis of two income tax cuts under Walker &apos; s. With the income figure of $65,618, the average tax due will be reduced by more than $185. The combination of these two types of tax cuts shows a decrease of over $330 in 2014 for the property-owning family at the middle income level of the Wisconsin families. Using the higher \"average family income\" of four people -- which Walker mentioned -- the average savings pay more than $350. In both cases, the figures support the declaration claim in the amount of US$232. Our evaluation of Walker tells television viewers that \"thanks to our reforms, the middle family will have an extra $322 to spend.\" With some solid sources, the Governor closely links the combined estimated savings of the middle-income family from his income reductions to the property tax. However, the claim needs to be clarified, as there are no conditions in each middle family to obtain a share of that size, especially if she is not a real estate owner. We're mostly assessing the claim right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07244"}
