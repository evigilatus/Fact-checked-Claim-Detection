Here are his alleged remarks, according to webbviners.com:\n\"During my lifetime, America was under different leaderships, but I have never seen someone to lead this nation with passion like Donald Trump...It\u2019s simple, he loves his nation, he loves each one of you ... This man might be the greatest of all time, we have to give him all the support we have.\"\nFacebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed.

We searched for the comments in Google and Nexis and found no evidence that Poiter made that statement.\nIn fact, we couldn\u2019t find any remarks of Poitier saying anything about either political party in a credible news source.\nWhat we do know about Poitier is that he was appointed ambassador of the Bahamas to Japan for 10 years and was awarded the 2009 Presidential Medal of Freedom by former President Barack Obama.\nYet, there is still no evidence that the actor made that statement.
