We\u2019re worried about our health. So why is Trump still trying to cut our Medicare? $451 billion in cuts in the middle of a deadly pandemic. Trump is putting us at risk,\" the commercial\u2019s narrator says.\u00a0\n\nThe PAC, which was formed in 2011 to support President Barack Obama\u2019s reelection campaign, has been tapped by Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, as his preferred choice among Democratic super PACS for big-donor giving.\u00a0\nThis ad caught our attention for two reasons. First, the term \"Medicare cuts\" has long been volleyed between both Republicans and Democrats in Congress and the White House \u2014 and often has proven to be a powerful political tool.\u00a0\nSecond, the connection between \"cuts\" to Medicare and the coronavirus pandemic was a new concept we wanted to explore.\u00a0\nWe reached out to Priorities USA Action to ask for the basis of these statements.\u00a0\nJosh Schwerin, a PAC spokesperson, sent us a links to news articles and confirmed that the \"$451 billion in cuts\" referred to Trump\u2019s 2021 proposed budget for Medicare.\u00a0\nAsked to pinpoint where the $451 billion came from, Schwerin pointed us to a February ABC News article that said the president\u2019s budget plan would \"whack away at federal spending on health care over the next 10 years ... including $451 billion less spent on Medicare.\" He also sent us links to a February Washington Blade article and February press release from Rep. Jahana Hayes (D-Conn.) \u2014 both of which also cited that figure.\u00a0\nCuts or a reduction in spending? An argument that\u2019s been around\nIn fall 2010, a few months after the Affordable Care Act was enacted, Republicans aired midterm campaign ads attacking Democrats for \"cutting\" or \"gutting\" Medicare. The reason was the law included a $500 billion reduction in projected spending for Medicare over 10 years, which would be used to help fund the ACA.\u00a0\nThe Obama administration said the reductions in spending would come from lowering payments to Medicare Advantage plans and providers and would not affect the level of care that Medicare beneficiaries received. They also said it would help make the Medicare system more financially stable.\u00a0\nNow, almost 10 years later, Democrats are using the same language to criticize the White House\u2019s long-term plan for Medicare spending.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"\u2018Cuts\u2019 is a term that has been thrown around for many years,\" said Tricia Neuman, executive director of the Program on Medicare Policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation. \"This is a semantic issue that often gets politicized, often in an election year.\" (Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the foundation).\u00a0\nNeuman explained that what is being considered here is a reduction in the projected increase in spending over a certain period. This reduction is based on estimates of how much the government is projected to spend on programs \u2014 factoring in proposed policy changes \u2014 for the following 10 years, taking into account current levels of spending, assumptions about economic growth and trends in use of Medicare coverage, said Neuman.\u00a0\nTrump\u2019s 2021 budget blueprint for Medicare estimated that spending would increase each of the 10 years. But the estimate also suggested that the administration\u2019s proposed policy changes would reduce the spending increase compared with estimates of what would be spent if the changes were not implemented.\u00a0\n\"Let\u2019s say Medicare spends $100 in 2020 and is projected to spend $200 in 2021,\" Neuman said. \"If the budget said we\u2019re going to reduce the growth in spending by $25, that's a reduction in an increase. But other people might call that a cut.\"\u00a0\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe number itself and what it means\u00a0\nWe reached out to the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees Medicare, for its take on that $451 billion figure, but have not heard back.\u00a0\u00a0\nMarc Goldwein, senior policy director for the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said the actual figure could be anywhere from $400 billion to $600 billion, depending on how calculations are done. His analysis relied on the executive branch\u2019s Office of Management and Budget calculations and landed on a figure close to $505 billion. Other variables, such as \"likely savings from drug price reform\" \u2014 yet to be enacted \u2014 move it closer to $600 billion.\u00a0\nThe left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities came up with a similar estimate: $501 billion. The Congressional Budget Office\u2019s estimate not including savings generated from proposed drug pricing reforms was closer to $400 billion.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn all cases, though, the reductions in Medicare spending would be achieved through proposals such as lowering payments to providers and paying the same amount for the same health service offered in different settings, among other things.\u00a0\nGoldwein said these proposals for Medicare reform are largely bipartisan and \"either mimic or build upon\" those advanced during the Obama era. He also said that, in his organization\u2019s view, the \"cuts\" are savings to the Medicare program and beneficiaries, who would see lower premiums and out-of-pocket medical costs.\u00a0\nThe policy experts said it\u2019s likely the reductions in spending wouldn\u2019t directly affect the care that Medicare beneficiaries receive. But provider groups have complained that lower reimbursements might drive some doctors to leave Medicare. Hospitals have argued against the proposal for equalizing payments for similar services because they say their overhead expenses are higher than those of a doctor\u2019s office or off-site clinic and their higher rates help finance other necessary services.\u00a0\nTiming matters\u00a0\nThe Priorities USA Action ad also alleges that Trump is trying to cut Medicare \"in the middle of a deadly pandemic.\" But the timeline of events doesn\u2019t support this statement.\u00a0\nThe White House released the 2021 budget proposal on Feb. 10 \u2014 well before the COVID-19 outbreak had become a part of our national consciousness.\u00a0\nThe first domestic case of COVID-19 was announced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Jan. 21. The World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the novel coronavirus a \"public health emergency of international concern\" on Jan. 30.\u00a0\nOn Feb. 10, the day the budget was released, the CDC put out a press release stating there were 13 cases of the disease in the U.S. CNN also published an article that day stating the vast majority of COVID-19 cases and deaths had occurred in China. Authorities didn\u2019t announce the first U.S. death from COVID-19 until Feb. 29. The WHO declared a pandemic on March 11.\u00a0\n\"These budget proposals were probably developed well before the pandemic hit the U.S. and hit it hard,\" said Neuman. However, she added, \"the administration hasn\u2019t disavowed these proposals, but they also haven\u2019t pushed them forward.\"\u00a0\nJoseph Antos, a scholar in health care and retirement policy at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute, said it was a \"ridiculous statement to connect cutting Medicare spending to the COVID crisis.\"\u00a0\n\"The implication of the video that this is going on actively while we\u2019re in the middle of this crisis, that\u2019s dead wrong,\" said Antos.\u00a0\nOur ruling\u00a0\nThe Priorities ad said Trump is trying to make $451 billion in Medicare cuts \"in the middle of a deadly pandemic.\"\nThis is an exaggerated attack, even before the pandemic is layered on top of it. The dollar figure itself is \"in the ballpark\" of what the policy proposals would generate in spending reductions, giving this ad a sliver of truth. However, in the Trump budget, the amount is spread out over ten years -- important context that was omitted. \u00a0\u00a0\nWhat\u2019s in Trump\u2019s budget proposal is not a direct cut to Medicare benefits. Instead, Priorities uses the age-old political tactic \u2014 employed on both sides of the aisle \u2014\u00a0of holding up a reduction in projected spending growth as a \"cut.\"\u00a0\nMoreover, the ad leaves the\u00a0impression that Trump is trying to whack Medicare for seniors at a time when panic is particularly high because of the coronavirus. But that connection to the pandemic is also misleading. The presidential budget was released weeks before most of the nation began to comprehend the threat of COVID-19.\u00a0\nThe claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts and context that would give a different impression.
