On Friday, billionaire and occasional presidential contender Donald Trump tweeted that the president\u2019s claim is based on a fundamental deception.\n\"ObamaCare enrollment lie: Obama counts an enrollee as a web user putting a plan in \u2018their online shopping carts\u2019,\" read Trump\u2019s tweet.\nAnyone curious about the first real test of the health care law is waiting to see how many people actually pay their first premium, so we thought it would be helpful to check the accuracy of Trump\u2019s statement.\nThere is a measure of truth to it, but it glides over many steps in the enrollment process.\nApplying for coverage\nWe buy so many things online, it\u2019s easy to think that buying health insurance through the government marketplaces follows a familiar pattern. You decide what you want to buy and then you pay for it. But getting health insurance coverage through an Obamacare marketplace is more complicated. Here\u2019s a summary of the steps involved:\n\n\nCreate an account\n\n\nGive the names and personal details for the people to be covered\n\n\nProvide Social Security numbers\n\n\nReport your household income\n\n\nList other insurance carried\n\n\nOption to explore Medicaid eligibility\n\n\nReport incarceration, recently gained immigration status, etc.\n\n\nReview and confirm accuracy of submitted information under penalty of perjury\n\n\nSelect tax credit (if eligible) and report tobacco use\n\n\nCompare and select a plan -- plan details and monthly premiums displayed\n\n\nConfirm plan selection, access to your tax returns (if using tax credits)\n\n\nSubmit application -- payment instructions\n\n\nThe final screen on the federal site looks like this:\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStaff at the press office for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the agency that handles Obamacare, told us that two things happen when this screen appears -- the government counts the person as enrolled and a data record called an 834 goes to the insurance company to start the billing process.\nIf the person clicks the green button at the bottom to pay, what they will see depends on the insurance company. If the company accepts online payment, in theory, they will end up on the company\u2019s payment page. Otherwise, they will get more details on the company\u2019s billing process.\nThe government doesn\u2019t itself accept payments. The mechanics of paying take place between the buyer and the insurance company.\nAt a couple of points in this process, the buyer clicks buttons that say \"Enroll,\" however, at the very end, they learn, \"Your payment must be received and processed by the effective date to be fully enrolled.\"\nTrump\u2019s tweet included a link to an article on the conservative news website, Townhall.com. The article said \"The federal government counts people putting Obamacare plans in their online shopping carts as 'enrolled'\u00a0before they pay for the plan or check out.\"\nA gradual path to full enrollment\nWhile it\u2019s accurate that the government will count someone as enrolled before they have paid their bill, in a limited fashion, the insurance companies will also treat them as if they were.\nAmerica\u2019s Health Insurance Plans is a leading trade association for insurers. According to the AHIP press office, most states require a grace period of 30 or 31 days to give the company time to bill and the buyer time to pay. During that time, the health plan is required to pay claims, so long as the person ultimately pays the premium. \u00a0\nAnyone who fails to pay after that first month has troubles.\nJonathan Katz is an independent insurance broker in Northern Virginia. Katz told PunditFact that in his area, very few carriers accept online payments and typically, billing takes place through the mail.\nSo far, Katz said the process has worked.\n\"The vast majority pay,\" Katz said. \"Why would you go through that long process and not pay?\"\nThe Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, said that figures from early February show that 80 to 85 percent of new customers have paid their first premium. Other insurance companies have reported similar numbers.\nOur ruling\nTrump said that the administration lies about enrollment figures because it counts people when all they have done is put a plan \"in their online shopping carts.\"\nWe've probably all put something in an online shopping cart, thought about it for a couple minutes, decided not to buy it and left it sitting there.\nIf that same scenario occurs on healthcare.gov, does the White House consider a person enrolled?\nNo. For a\u00a0person to be\u00a0considered enrolled, they must have submitted their application for health insurance. That information is transmitted to the federal government and the private insurance company.\nIn a literal sense, that\u2019s more than just popping something into an online shopping cart a la Amazon.\u00a0\nTrump also is guilty of oversimplifying a highly regulated private industry. While some insurance companies accept online payments and give Obamacare enrollees the option to pay immediately, many do not. In the Virginia-Maryland market for example, most companies mail bills to the new customers who come through the government marketplaces. That means customers don\u2019t even have the option of paying straight away.\nAlso, while customers may not have paid, most states require a grace period of 30 or 31 days where insurers are required to pay claims.\u00a0\nSo maybe they don\u2019t intend to pay and will eventually lose their coverage. But for now, they are treated as if they were\u00a0enrolled. And they did a lot more than just load up an online shopping cart.\nWe rate Trump\u2019s claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07967"}
