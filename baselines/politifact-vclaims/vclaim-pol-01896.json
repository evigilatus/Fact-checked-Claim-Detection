Kamala Harris \u2018supporting MS-13\u2019", "text": "The White House made an inflammatory attack on California Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris this week, claiming on its official Twitter account that she is \"supporting the animals of MS-13.\"\nHere\u2019s the tweet from July 2, 2018:\n\nIt\u2019s part of a pattern of attacks by President Trump and his administration on Democrats over immigration enforcement and the violent gang MS-13, or La Mara Salvatrucha. The gang grew out of poor Los Angeles neighborhoods where many refugees from civil wars in El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua lived in the 1980s.\nFor this fact check, we examined the tweet about Harris. We also reviewed similar attacks.\nHarris repudiates claim\nThe White House did not respond to our request for evidence supporting the claim. Harris strongly rejected it, replying to the White House on Twitter:\n\"As a career prosecutor, I actually went after gangs and transnational criminal organizations. That\u2019s being a leader on public safety. What is not, is ripping babies from their mothers.\"\nHarris was California\u2019s attorney general and San Francisco\u2019s district attorney before she was elected to the Senate in 2016. She is often mentioned as a potential 2020 presidential candidate.\nShe added in another tweet:\n\"My record speaks for itself:\n\u2192 Arrested members of drug trafficking organizations that smuggled in narcotics to the United States\n\u2192 Announced the arrests in a murder-for-hire plot by a Tijuana-based drug cartel\n\u2192 Confiscated 500lbs of meth from a Mexican cartel\"\nWe found no evidence Harris has ever supported or expressed any sympathy for MS-13.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in remarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPattern of baseless claims \u00a0\nThis is not the first rhetorical firebomb on MS-13 lobbed at Democrats by Trump or the White House. In a speech in May, Trump claimed California Rep. Nancy Pelosi \"came out in favor of MS-13.\" PolitiFact found Pelosi hasn\u2019t defended the gang and rated it False. Trump has repeated it in subsequent speeches.\nOn the same day the White House tweeted\u00a0about Harris, it also attacked Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, saying: \"@SenWarren, why are you supporting criminals moving weapons, drugs, and victims across our nation\u2019s borders? You must not know what ICE really does.\"\nDemocrats, including Harris, Pelosi and Warren, have criticized Trump\u2019s policy of separating children from migrants and asylum seekers entering the country. They\u2019ve also called for reforming, or in some cases abolishing, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency, or ICE, and replacing it with a new agency.\nThey have not, however, explicitly called for ending immigration enforcement. Nor have they made statements in favor of MS-13.\nHere\u2019s what Harris said on MSNBC in June about ICE:\n\"I think there\u2019s no question that we\u2019ve got to critically re-examine ICE and its role and the way it is being administered and the work it is doing,\" Harris said. \"And we need to probably think about starting from scratch because there's a lot that is wrong with the way that it's conducting itself. And we need to deal with that.\"\nOur ruling\nThe White House attacked Sen. Kamala Harris for \"supporting the animals of MS-13,\" in a tweet from its official account.\nHarris and other Democrats have sharply criticized the Trump administration for its immigration policies. They have expressed concern about how those entering the country, legally and illegally, are treated and called for reforming or replacing ICE.\nThat\u2019s not the same thing as or even close to \"supporting\" a violent criminal gang.\nWe found no information showing Harris has supported or sympathized with MS-13. When asked, the White House provided no evidence to back up its reckless attack, which fits with a pattern of other baseless claims on the subject. \u00a0\nWe rated the White House claim Pants On Fire.\n\nPANTS ON FIRE \u2013\u00a0The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.\n Share the Facts 2018-07-04 01:07:04 UTC   PolitiFact    1 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Pants on Fire  Sen.
