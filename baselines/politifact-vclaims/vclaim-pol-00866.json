Tony Evers is seeking to make his mark on the state and Republicans are making the case that fiscal policies enacted under all-GOP control are worth continuing.\nState Rep. John Nygren, R-Marinette, co-chair of the powerful budget-writing Joint Finance Committee, hammered that point in a string of tweets on Feb. 12, 2019, including one that claimed Wisconsin\u2019s financial outlook \"is the strongest in a generation.\"\nBut it was a\u00a0tweet later in the string that caught our eye:\n\"Over the last eight years, we\u2019ve shown that even though we\u2019ve cut \u2026 taxes by $8 billion, revenues continue to grow,\" Nygren said.\nRevenue generally comes from, well, taxes, so can one go up while the other goes down that much?\nLet\u2019s see if the numbers add up.\nRevenues on the rise in recent years\nThere are two parts to this claim \u2014 that taxes were cut by $8 billion and that revenues are growing.\nTax cuts get complicated, so let\u2019s warm up the revenue side of the equation.\n\nThe nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau\u2019s\u00a0report on tax collections shows consistent growth in recent years. Going back eight years to 2010-\u201911 -- the period referenced in Nygren\u2019s claim -- the state\u2019s overall general fund tax collection has grown every year but one.\nThe revenue increase was generally 3 to 4 percent annually, with the exception of 2013-\u201914. That year revenue dropped slightly after the Legislature implemented a series of tax cuts.\nOverall from 2010-\u201911 to 2017-\u201918, general fund tax collections rose from $12.9 billion to $16.1 billion. And they\u2019re expected to rise to $16.6 billion in 2018-\u201919 according to the\u00a0latest fiscal bureau estimate.\nSo, yes, revenues have grown.\nTax cut figure has drawn \u2018True\u2019 ratings before\nAs proof of the $8 billion cut cited by Nygren, his staff provided a fiscal bureau memo that listed changes to a variety of taxes since 2011. They include things like health savings accounts, farm loss limit, sales tax exemptions and technical college funding.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe chart tallies up the tax changes relative to the 2010-\u201911 level across the eight-year span. So if a tax dropped by $1 million the first year and stayed at that same level each of the next seven years, it is counted as an $8 million \"cut\" over the eight-year span \u2014 since the total is $8 million below where it would have been if the 2010-\u201911 level remained in place each year.\nThe taxes paid in this simplified example would only get lower once, in the first year. But the approach used in the memo \u2014 and by Nygren \u2014 counts the savings generated each year relative to the 2010-\u201911 level.\nThe tally shows $4.8 billion in reductions to income and franchise taxes and a $3.6 billion reduction in property taxes compared to the 2010-\u201911 baseline.\nThe property tax reductions cited are not given directly to taxpayers, they are sent to local municipalities. Local officials could choose to cut property taxes by an identical amount and pass those savings on to taxpayers, but that doesn\u2019t always happen.\nThat property tax relief did reduce taxes that otherwise would have been paid, though.\nExperts disagree on whether it\u2019s correct to call all these changes tax \"cuts,\" since it counts reductions in multiple years when the level of the tax is only \"cut\" once. But the net effect is to cut the amount of tax paid.\nAnd we\u2019ve rated claims in this vein True in the past.\nIn 2015, we rated then-Gov. Scott Walker\u2019s statement True when he used the same approach from the fiscal bureau to refer to what was then $4.7 billion in tax cuts.\nWe gave Walker another True in 2017 for referring to what would become $8 billion in \"tax cuts.\"\nAnd we gave Walker a True for using the figure on the campaign trail in June 2018, touting it as \"$8 billion in cumulative tax relief.\"\nNygren\u2019s verbiage calling that tally a \"tax cut\" differed from Walker\u2019s statement in 2018 but is in line with how Walker referred to it in our 2015 and 2017 fact checks\nOur rating\nNygren said under eight years of Republican leadership Wisconsin has \"cut taxes\" by $8 billion while revenues have risen.\nThe revenues portion of the statement is clearly accurate.\nThe tax cut element is a bit more nuanced, but the changes Republicans made did result in a net savings of $8 billion for taxpayers compared to if the 2010-\u201911 tax levels had remained in place.\nAnd we\u2019ve rated very similar claims as True in the past.\nWe rate Nygren\u2019s statement True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00866"}
