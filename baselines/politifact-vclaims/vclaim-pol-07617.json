How quaint.\nCollins took to Twitter to crow.\n\"Another great endorsement! Barrow Journal explains the difference between me and Jody Hice,\" Collins wrote in a June 23 tweet. The post links to a June 20 column by Chris Bridges, editor of the weekly community newspaper.\nThe problem, the Hice campaign says, is the newspaper does not endorse candidates. Any claim of an endorsement would be false, said Hice\u2019s communications director, Clarke Brannon, who contacted PolitiFact Georgia for a fact check.\n\"We\u2019re trying to keep all of the facts on the table,\" Brannon said. \"It\u2019s not the paper that has endorsed him, just a personal column by the editor.\"\nJournalists love to debate the merits of endorsements almost as much as they love extolling the innate deliciousness of election night pizza.\nBut if you\u2019re not in a newsroom, and couldn't care less about PolitiFact\u2019s poor dining choices, you likely need a quick primer on endorsements.\nPolitical endorsements are the public declarations from well-known people and organizations in support of a specific candidate.\nThe goal is to use the name recognition and star power \u2013 not to mention money and connections \u2013 to boost one candidate in a race.\nCollins\u2019 campaign has won that sort of an endorsement from former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. Hice\u2019s campaign has earned an endorsement from Georgia Right To Life.\nSimilarly, newspapers have long endorsed candidates from local, state and national races on their editorial pages.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut a growing number of publications have backed away from endorsements in recent years, worried that the practice threatened journalistic independence of the news pages.\nThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution still endorsed candidates in 2008 but began phasing it out a year later.\nA column before the May primary put it this way, \"In an era when information on candidates is widely available, you don't need us to tell you how to vote.\"\nThe Barrow Journal feels the same way for its official pages. It has not endorsed a candidate since its launch in 2008, editor Bridges said.\nBridges said his column is meant to be his opinion alone. Neither campaign contacted him to clarify on his piece about the race, but he said he could see how the practice could be confusing to people outside a newsroom.\n\"Most people don\u2019t have a clue how it all works,\" Bridges said. \"It\u2019s my opinion, so if it\u2019s taken as an endorsement at all, it\u2019s my personal endorsement, not anything from the paper as a whole.\"\nCollins spokesman Brandon Phillips said the campaign understood the distinction. That\u2019s why the tweet referenced an endorsement and the paper, without claiming an official endorsement.\nBy contrast, the campaign\u2019s Twitter feed clearly stated former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel had endorsed Collins on Monday.\nPhillips said Handel was also making calls on behalf of Collins, as Gingrich had done earlier.\n\"When we roll out an endorsement, you know it\u2019s an endorsement,\" Phillips said.\nKnowing is one thing. Caring is another issue altogether.\nA 2012 Pew Research Center/Washington Post poll found that most Republican voters didn\u2019t think endorsements mattered in the presidential matchup.\nWhether the support was from specific figures such as Donald Trump, community leaders or, you guessed it, newspapers, the majority of the 1,000-person sample said endorsements did little to help and could even hurt a candidate.\nWith all of that in mind, it appears Collins did refer to an endorsement and link to a newspaper column. But he did not claim a specific endorsement \u2013 which needs some explaining to understand. \nIt\u2019s that additional information that moves it down a bit on the AJC Truth-O-Meter.
