So we asked the Hillary Clinton campaign where Kaine got the information for that statement.\nSarah Peck, the Virginia director of communications for the Clinton campaign, pointed us to news articles and other sources about Nixon\u2019s tax disclosures.\nWe also looked at the website for the Presidential Tax History Project, which is run by Tax Analysts, a Falls Church-based nonprofit that specializes in tax issues. That group has compiled tax returns online for past presidents and major-party presidential nominees.\nOn the group\u2019s website, you\u2019ll find copies of Nixon\u2019s tax returns from 1969 through 1972.\nBut there\u2019s a catch. Those returns were not released while Nixon was running for president. They were released in December 1973, a year after he was re-elected.\nAt the time, the 37th president was embroiled in the Watergate scandal, and questions were being raised about whether something also was amiss with his tax filings.\nReports had surfaced that Nixon had been paying a small amount of federal tax for several years, a function of having secured a large deduction for donating his vice presidential papers to the National Archives, said Joseph J. Thorndike, a historian at Tax Analysts.\nTo quell lingering concerns, Nixon released tax returns to the public as well as to the Joint Committee on Taxation despite the\u00a0fact that the president was under an IRS audit at the time, Thorndike told us.\nSo Nixon did indeed release his full tax returns as president. Did he ever do that while he was running for that office? Nixon ran for president three times, so let\u2019s go back a bit further in history.\nPeck pointed us to a 1984 story in The New York Times, which noted that in his successful 1968 campaign for the presidency, Nixon released a brief summary of his financial affairs.\nIn the 1968 nominating contest, Nixon faced a field of GOP candidates that included Michigan Gov. George Romney.\nRomney, whose son Mitt was the GOP presidential nominee in 2012, released a dozen years of his tax returns to Look magazine, according to a Bloomberg column written by Stephen Mihm, an associate professor of history at the University of Georgia.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Look (magazine) then went to Nixon, who proved distinctly less forthcoming. He permitted a writer to inspect photocopies of his returns, but only three years\u2019 worth,\" Mihm wrote.\nThe history professor added that the issue didn\u2019t come up during the general election campaign, because Democratic nominee Hubert Humphrey also refused to release his tax returns.\nMihm told us that Look magazine merely summarized selected information from Nixon\u2019s returns, rather than publishing the documents themselves.\n\"I suppose one could argue that Nixon gave a journalist access to his returns, but that\u2019s not the same thing as releasing them,\" Mihm wrote in an email.\nThorndike also told us that Nixon\u2019s limited disclosure in that instance wouldn\u2019t really count as the candidate releasing his tax returns to the public. A reporter was able to look at them but wasn\u2019t allowed to keep a copy of them, Thorndike noted.\n\"In my book, that would not count as releasing your tax returns, because the whole crowd source thing is a big part of it,\" Thorndike said.\nWe couldn\u2019t find any record of Nixon releasing tax returns during his two other runs for the presidency - in 1960, against John F. Kennedy, or in his 1972 re-election bid against George McGovern.\nThorndike said that, to his knowledge, Nixon didn\u2019t release his returns during those campaigns. Mihm also told us he\u2019s not aware of Nixon releasing his tax returns during any of his presidential campaigns.\nStill, Thorndike said Nixon\u2019s presidential tax return disclosure, while he was president in 1973, did start a tradition where presidents and candidates seeking the highest office release their returns to the public.\nNixon\u2019s successor, Gerald Ford, did not release his tax returns publicly but instead provided a summary of his taxes. But Jimmy Carter did publicly release his tax returns while running against Ford in 1976. In fact, every major-party nominee since Carter has released them to the public, Thorndike said.\nOur ruling\nKaine said, \"Even Richard Nixon released his tax returns to the public when he was running for president ...\"\nNixon never released his tax returns during a presidential campaign.\nBut there is a kernel of truth in Kaine\u2019s statement. Nixon released his full returns when he already was president, to quell controversy over his taxes.\nAlso while running in 1968, he allowed a reporter to examine his returns, but beyond that limited circumstance, there\u2019s no record that Nixon opened his tax forms to the general public.\nWhile Kaine\u2019s statement has an element of truth, it ignores facts that would create a different impression. We rate his statement Mostly False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/e5913d6f-75bb-4d4e-bb5b-c112a9635685", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04442"}
