The agency concluded that the economic benefits of reducing mercury emissions under an Obama-era rule do not outweigh the costs to the power plants of complying with the rules.\nPolitiFact looked into Pelosi\u2019s claim that even Trump\u2019s EPA said the new rule would be bad for public health and cost billions of dollars. The facts are more nuanced than Pelosi said.\nRegulation of mercury and other pollutants\nThe main pollutant at issue is mercury due to its impact on public health. When mercury released into the air by power plants reaches bodies of water, it is converted by micro-organisms into methylmercury, a highly toxic substance that builds up in fish.\u00a0\nThe most common way people are exposed to mercury is by eating fish contaminated with methylmercury. Some fish have higher levels of mercury that, when consumed, can be harmful to an unborn child, a young child\u2019s developing nervous system, the elderly, people with underlying health conditions, and people who eat a lot of fish.\nThe EPA regulates emissions of air toxics from coal- and oil-fired power plants under the Clean Air Act. The Obama administration added Mercury and Air Toxic Standards that set federal air pollution limits for power plants, seeking to reduce emissions of mercury and other toxic air pollutants.\u00a0\nThe Obama administration estimated that the standards would prevent, annually, up to 11,000 premature deaths, more than 100,000 asthma attacks, about 4,700 heart attacks, reduce hospital and emergency room visits, and hundreds of thousands of days missed from work due to illness.\nIt projected that the compliance cost to the power plant industry would be about $9.6 billion a year, while the financial value of air quality improvements could range from $37 billion to $90 billion annually.\nThe benefits calculation under the Obama administration included \"co-benefits,\" which occur when regulation compliance also reduces a pollutant that is not the rule\u2019s primary target. The vast majority of the financial benefits came from a reduction of particulate matter, which can lead to serious health problems. The direct quantified benefit of reducing mercury alone \u2014 the intended target \u2014 was up to $6 million a year.\nTrump administration revises benefits-cost analysis\nThe Trump administration reviewed analyses done by the Obama administration and decided to take \"co-benefits\" out of the equation. Ultimately, it said that the financial benefits of the Obama rule totaled $4 million to $6 million annually (when accounting for reduction of mercury alone), while the annual cost of compliance was $7.4 billion to $9.6 billion.\nAs a result, the EPA under Trump said it \"determined that it is not \u2018appropriate and necessary\u2019 to regulate hazardous air pollutant emissions from power plants under section 112 of the Clean Air Act.\" The rule limiting emission of mercury and air toxics remained in place.\nDid the EPA under Trump argue against the change?\nThe objection Pelosi is talking about stems from a report by the EPA\u2019s Science Advisory Board.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe board is an independent committee that advises the EPA administrator on the information that is used to develop the agency\u2019s rules. Board members serve as special government employees, but their views do not reflect the views of the EPA, an agency spokesperson told us.\u00a0\nOn April 9, the board advised the EPA to do a new assessment on mercury\u2019s impact. It said that the assessment from Trump\u2019s EPA was not all-encompassing and did not take into consideration prior board recommendations. The report was logged before the agency announced the final rule.\nThe board said it was a departure from the norm for the EPA to \"categorically\" exclude co-benefits. The move went against both the EPA\u2019s guidance on economic analysis and recommendations of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget.\u00a0\nThe EPA reviewed links between methylmercury and brain damage, but the board said the agency should do a new risk assessment that also accounted for mercury\u2019s impact on cardiovascular health.\nThe EPA\u2019s assessment on exposure to methylmercury excluded commercial fish \u2014 such as fish purchased at restaurants or supermarkets, even though it accounts for 90% of the fish consumed by Americans, the report said.\n\"For this or any future regulation, the EPA should prepare a new exposure estimate that accounts for total exposure,\" the report said.\nMichael Honeycutt, chair of the EPA\u2019s Science Advisory Board, said the board did have concerns with how the EPA did its analysis, but it\u2019s difficult to definitively confirm whether the EPA's new rule would lead to serious health problems, death and billions of dollars of expense.\n\"The EPA would need to re-do a risk assessment and take into account our recommendations,\" said Honeycutt, who also is director of the Toxicology Division of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.\nOther experts said Pelosi was right to infer that the EPA\u2019s change would be detrimental to public health and cost billions annually.\n\"The report does not use those precise words, but it is reasonable to infer that the SAB believes that the new rule is ill advised,\" said Patrick Parenteau, a law professor and senior counsel in the Environmental and Natural Resources Law Clinic at Vermont Law School. He said it was also reasonable to infer that the rule would increase the risk of diseases and that the total benefits of reducing pollutants would \"more than offset the costs of pollution controls.\"\nThe practical effect of the new procedure is unclear, he said, because it likely will be challenged in court or a new administration may repeal it.\nOur ruling\nPelosi said, \"Even President Trump\u2019s own EPA has admitted that this rule (on air pollutants) threatens to cause serious health problems including brain damage and death and to inflict billions of dollars of economic damage on our struggling economy.\"\nTrump did not overrule his own EPA, the agency rather did not adhere to recommendations from a science advisory board. The advisory board told the EPA it had concerns with how the agency did a risk assessment and said it should do a new one.\nThe chair of the advisory board said that in the absence of a new assessment, it was difficult to say definitively whether the rule would have the impact Pelosi said. Other experts say that while the report did not outright say what Pelosi stated, it was accurate to infer that the rule changes could pose serious health risks for Americans.\nWe rate Pelosi\u2019s statement Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17000"}
