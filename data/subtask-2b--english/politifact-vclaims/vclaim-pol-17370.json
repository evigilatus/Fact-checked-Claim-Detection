But the photo of a young man wearing glasses and an SS uniform is not the billionaire Democratic donor, despite what some posts would have you believe.\n\"I give you George Soros,\" the text stamped over the image, which was originally posted to Facebook in 2016, says. \"A(n) SS in the National Socialist German Workers Party. Nazi Party. He served under Adolf Hitler and Heinrich Himmler.\"\nThe post, which has been shared more than 22,000 times, was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

The photo isn\u2019t fake or doctored, but it also doesn\u2019t show Soros, despite what the text attached to it says. A quick reverse image search reveals that much.\nIn reality, the photo is of Oskar Gr\u00f6ning, a former SS soldier who was sentenced to four years in prison in 2015 for being complicit in the murder of 300,000 people during the Holocaust.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA screenshot of a Facebook meme wrongly identifying Oskar Gr\u00f6ning as George Soros (PolitiFact).\nThe sentence was handed down when Gr\u00f6ning, who died in 2018, was 94 years old.

When the Nazis invaded Hungary, Soros\u2019 father obtained a false identity for Soros and sent him to live with an agricultural official who passed him off as his Christian godson, according to the New York Times.\nWe rate this statement Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17370"}
