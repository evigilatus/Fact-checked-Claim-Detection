He proceeded to chop up his deck with a hatchet while looking for the fire-setting raccoons,\" DeWine said.\n\nThat got PolitiFact Ohio\u2019s curiosity going, so it decided to look into the facts behind the bizarre tale. Examining the statement might provide useful information to people unfamiliar with the drug and its effects.\n\nWhen we called DeWine\u2019s office for information to back up his account, spokesman Dan Tierney provided an Ohio State Highway Patrol study to educate the law enforcement community about bath salts.\n\nBath salts, which became illegal in Ohio in 2011, are a synthetic drug that can be snorted, injected or mixed with a fluid to drink. Users have said the drug gives an intense high and a rush similar to cocaine, according to the highway patrol study, which was completed in May. Others have described users as violent, unpredictable and paranoid.\n\nThe study includes a short description of the raccoon event DeWine described \u2013 along with five other incidents involving bath salts \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t provide any details about the time, place and people involved. We called the highway patrol and were told the incident happened in Reynoldsburg, near Columbus. The police department there provided a report with written accounts from three responding officers.\n\nThe police report includes a transcript of the 911 call in August 2011 from the 31-year-old Reynoldsburg man who was seeing raccoons:\n\n\"I got raccoons in my house that are starting fires. I wonder how the hell they are doing it,\" he said. \"I keep putting them out but they start another one. I had to drive down here because I couldn\u2019t find my cell phone. I think one of them took it and did something with it.\"\n\nThe report also said the man told police he took bath salts three times that day and could be hallucinating. A local fire department determined there were no fires inside the house.\n\nOne of the officers noticed the deck at the house was destroyed and there was a hatchet nearby. The man told police he chopped up the deck because he was looking for a dead raccoon.\n\nSo where does that leave us?\n\nDeWine\u2019s account at the press conference last month was backed up by the Reynoldsburg police report. His only misstep was saying state patrolmen confronted the man. The mistake is immaterial because it doesn\u2019t change the circumstances of the incident and the role of bath salts, according to police.\n\nThe Reynoldsburg man, for what it\u2019s worth, eventually pleaded guilty to a charge of making false alarms.\n\nDeWine\u2019s statement is accurate and there is nothing significant missing. That rates True on the Truth-O-Meter.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in remarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 29, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09944"}
