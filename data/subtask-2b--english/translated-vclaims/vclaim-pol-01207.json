Is that right? We've had a good look. In September 2018, the United States Census Bureau released a report containing data on household income in 2017. In the United States, the figure was $60,336, while in West Virginia it was $43,469. The difference is exactly 16,867, as Romano said. At the same time, we ranked the 50 states according to household income and found West Virginia to be the last, and Mississippi followed by $60.
