Mike Pence officially accepted the GOP\u2019s nomination for vice president July 21, 2016, in Cleveland, and didn\u2019t miss a beat when it came to assailing Hillary Clinton.\n\"It was Hillary Clinton who left Americans in harm's way in Benghazi and after four Americans fell said, 'What difference at this point does it make?' \" Pence said, eliciting loud boos from the audience.\nWe\u2019ve heard a version of this attack several times at the Republican National Convention, with some versions more accurate than others.\nBoth parts of this particular claim are inaccurate. There is no evidence showing Clinton personally \"left Americans in harm\u2019s way in Benghazi.\" And while he\u2019s using Clinton words, he\u2019s misattributing their meaning.\nLeaving Americans \u2018in harm\u2019s way\u2019\nWe reached out to the Trump campaign to clarify what Pence meant by Clinton leaving \"Americans in harm\u2019s way\" but didn\u2019t hear back immediately.\nIt could refer to her alleged inaction after the attacks in sending troops to the scene. Or, to her allegedly brushing off requests for more security at the Benghazi compound. Or, her \"sleeping through\" the attacks. No matter, all of these claims are inaccurate -- some more so than others.\nLet\u2019s take a look one by one.\nBefore he officially got the job, Pence knocked Clinton for taking \"13 hours to send help to Americans under fire.\"\nWe rated that False. Clinton was not responsible for sending help to Benghazi; that fell to military officials. The Defense Department attempted to send help to the scene, but was unable to reach Benghazi before the deaths occurred.\nOthers have accused Clinton of ignoring requests for more security for the Benghazi consulate. It\u2019s undeniable that officials in Libya repeatedly asked for better security, but there\u2019s no evidence that Clinton herself was aware or that she willfully denied them.\nAnd finally, Pence may have been making his running mate\u2019s point that the Benghazi victims were \"left helpless to die as Hillary Clinton soundly slept in her bed.\"\nThat\u2019s also False. Clinton was not literally sleeping when the attacks unfolded, as it was mid afternoon in Washington. Emails show she worked late into the night.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaking Trump\u2019s and Pence\u2019s claim more broadly, was Clinton inattentive as the attacks unfolded?\nIn its recently released report, the House select committee on Benghazi did conclude that there were State Department and overall administrative failings, but Pence and Trump blamed Clinton specifically.\nAnd neither that probe nor the seven congressional investigations before it have suggested Clinton was personally responsible or could have prevented the attack.\nClinton, for her part, has accepted responsibility for the attack as the head of the State Department at the time.\n\u2018What difference at this point does it make?\u2019\nPence\u2019s claim that she made this oft-repeated comment in response \"after four Americans fell\" is also inaccurate.\nClinton\u2019s comments, said during a hearing months after the attack, was not an expression of apathy over the deaths.It was an exasperated response to Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., pressing Clinton on why State Department officials in Washington didn\u2019t call their counterparts in Libya to determine the cause of the attack (protests over a video mocking Islam or a planned terrorist attack).\nClinton told Johnson her priority was figuring out how to rescue them, not pressing them for information, and it wasn\u2019t appropriate to talk to the them before FBI interviews. When Johnson continued to press her for a more straightforward answer, Clinton gave her exasperated answer.\n\"With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans. Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided that they\u2019d they go kill some Americans? What difference, at this point, does it make?\" she said.\n(You can read the full six-minute transcript here, courtesy of PolitiFact Wisconsin.)\nOur ruling\nPence said, \"It was Hillary Clinton who left Americans in harm's way in Benghazi and after four Americans fell said, 'What difference at this point does it make?' \"\nIt\u2019s reasonable to argue that Clinton, as head of the State Department, should shoulder some responsibility for the bureaucratic failures that may have contributed to the tragedy. But there\u2019s no evidence that suggests, as Pence does, that Clinton was personally responsible for or could have prevented the deaths of the four Benghazi victims.\nAs for Clinton\u2019s comment, it did not come \"after four Americans fell,\" but in a subsequent congressional hearing. She was responding to a senator\u2019s repeated questioning over why she didn\u2019t call department workers in Benghazi to figure out the cause of the attack, not to the fact that four Americans had died.\nWe rate Pence\u2019s claim Mostly False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/cc86c916-cd46-45bb-8bf7-fef3c599cc4c", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04647"}
