Tony Evers has increased expenditure on roads and infrastructure, as well as on special education, including increases for State employees, among other changes. Overall, the budget is about $83.5 billion. But does it increase taxes and create deficits? David Craig (Fernon City) thinks so. \"Goff. The proposed budget for Evers has huge increases in taxes and fees, but it spends more on its way to a deficit of nearly $2 billion, \"Craig said on Twitter on April 2, 2019. Is Craig right? Yeah, and no. We contacted Craig to get support for the claim, but his employees didn't respond. However, it is quite clear what he refers to in his tweet. Let's start with the tax portion of the equation. Does the proposed budget for Evers include increases in taxes and fees? The non-partisan Financial Legislative Bureau, which considered the gold standard in state financial matters, issued a report on April 1, 2019 stating that the answer is yes. In some cases, tax increases in the Evers budget correspond to other changes. For example, the gas tax will increase by 8 cents, from 32.9 cents to 40.9 cents. At the same time, the plan calls for the repeal of the law requiring retailers in many cases to sell gas by 9 per cent above the wholesale price, which Evers says will reduce the overall cost of gas. Budget lists support the agricultural and manufacturing tax exemption established by the Republicans. He's using some of this money to help pay middle-class income tax. However, as reported by the newspaper Milwaukee Journal Sentinel on March 14, 2011, the budget of Evers includes a net increase of over $1 billion in tax increases over the biennium. But what about the deficit part of the claim, where Craig Evers said he was spending \"more on his way to a deficit of about $2 billion.\" This is where the apples meet the oranges. In part one of its claim, Craig refers to the Evers budget proposal for a two-year period. Under the law, that budget must be balanced. It is. So where does the $2 billion come from? Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" This figure comes from the Financial Bureau, but refers to what is usually called \"structural deficit.\" That's something that's been going on for a long time. In short, the measure of structural deficits comes from determining future spending and income trends to create a projected gap (or surplus) for years on the road. According to the LFB report, the budget of Evers will balance between 2019 and 2020, but the expenditure patterns it establishes will create a shortfall of $847 million for 2021. The Department of Management also includes projections. Their estimates show a potential deficit of $1.1 billion in 2022 and about $1.9 billion by 2023. Of course, there are many things that can happen from time to time: the economy may improve more than expected, bringing more tax revenues. Or, inflation can be higher than expected, making the administration of the state government more expensive. In other words, the picture can become better or worse. In this regard, the structural deficit figures are hypothetical: Evers will again have to submit a balanced budget for the second half of his term. However, the figures represent a real measure that provides an indication of the overall financial viability of the State. When it's Goof. Scott Walker took office in January 2011 and spoke of facing a $3.6 billion structural deficit. It is based on expected tax revenues and expenditure costs, including budget requests already submitted by the outgoing Government. Jim Doyle's stick. In fact, Wisconsin has a long-term structural deficit. According to the Financial Office, it was present at least in the last 10 budget cycles, or about 20 years. What's the best view? \"Part of this is politics and part of this is telling the truth,\" said Craig Maher, Professor of Public Affairs at Nebraska-Omaha University, who studied public expenditure and budgets in Wisconsin. The governor runs a structural deficit, but remember, Wisconsin has been running this deficit for 20 years. If you look at any administration before, there has always been this deficit so this is not something new born by Governor Evers.\" Although the State had previously faced a structural deficit in the past, the proposal proposed by Evers was larger than some of the previous cases. Maher pointed out that, unlike the Federal Government, states were required to provide balanced budgets under the law. In contrast, the Federal Government can face an annual deficit that in turn adds to long-term national debt. This is where the apple mixer is shaking by Craig. It compares the current budget with possible long-term issues in future budgets, making the plan look the same before the legislature left $2 billion in red during the same budget period. Our assessment, Craig, says that the budget of Evers increases taxes and creates a deficit of about $2 billion. The budget increases taxes. But it must be balanced by law. However, the projected figures show that Evers will start the next two years &apos; budget, starting in July 2021, with an expected difference of $1.96 billion. This number will change based on economic performance and other factors. We're assessing this claim half right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00726"}
