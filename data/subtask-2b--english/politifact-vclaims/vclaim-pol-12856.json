He said Austin has lately had a cost-of-living index of 94.8 on a scale where the national average is 100. The Austin result, he said, exceeds the indexes on the site for Dallas, Houston, El Paso, Fort Worth, San Antonio, Corpus Christi, Arlington, Laredo and Plano.\n\n\"We were just trying to find a site that gives reasonable comparisons,\" Jack said.\n\nAnd why is Shade at fault? Jack said there\u2019s blame to go around, but Shade\u2019s votes to build water treatment and biomass energy plants and have the city spend money on water and wastewater lines to the Formula One race track being built east of the airport helped keep costs high. So did her failure to support a city homestead exemption on property taxes, he said, or a remedy for reported under-valuation of commercial property for tax purposes.\n\n\"The leadership of the council with regard to fiscal responsibility has to start somewhere,\" Jack said.\n\nWe looked up his cited website. It showed Austin with a January 2011 cost-of-living index of 94.8, as Jack said. The next-highest big Texas cities were Dallas and Fort Worth, both at 94.4, followed by Arlington at 94.2. The least costly big Texas city was El Paso, at 83.2, according to the site.\n\nNoting the site does not say how the indexes were reached, we emailed the site\u2019s administrators and didn\u2019t hear back.\n\nSeparately, we asked Austin\u2019s city demographer, Ryan Robinson, for guidance on the local cost of living. He referred us to the Greater Austin Chamber of Commerce, whose vice president of research, Beverly Kerr, told us many communities participate in regular surveys gauging the cost of living around the country.\n\nKerr was referring to a composite cost-of-living index managed by the Virginia-based Council for Community and Economic Research, a nonprofit. According to council information, the index \"measures regional differences in the cost of consumer goods and services, excluding taxes and non-consumer expenditures, for professional and managerial households in the top income quintile\" and is \"based on more than 90,000 prices covering 60 different items for which prices are collected quarterly by chambers of commerce, economic development organizations, and university applied economic centers in each participating urban area.\" Finally, it\u2019s \"based on six component categories \u2013 housing, utilities, grocery items, transportation, health care and miscellaneous goods and services.\"\n\nKerr forwarded the council\u2019s composite index results for Texas cities for the first three months of 2011 and its annual indexes for 2007 through 2010, a period covering Shade\u2019s council years and the year before.\n\nOn a scale where 100 is the national average, Austin\u2019s index was 93.4 in this year\u2019s first quarter. Two big Texas cities had higher indexes: Arlington (93.5) and Dallas (95.8). Similarly, in 2010, Austin had the third-highest cost of living index among the state\u2019s big cities, 95.5. San Antonio\u2019s index was 95.6, the one for Arlington was 99.3.\n\nIn 2009, though, Austin ranked No. 1 among the state\u2019s big cities, at 96.5. In 2008, it landed narrowly second with an index of 95.5 to San Antonio\u2019s 95.6. And in 2007, Austin led the state\u2019s big cities, at 94.5.\n\nWe sought out Dean Frutiger, project manager for the council\u2019s cost-of-living index, who noted that the most expensive city in Texas appears to be less costly than the national average. Austin\u2019s costs, he said, are \"still way below the national average. What\u2019s the big deal?\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen again, Frutiger said, it may be significant to any Texas comparisons that the index doesn\u2019t consider property taxes, which are a big deal in the state.\n\nSo we made a run at seeing how property taxes in Austin stack up compared to those in the state\u2019s other big cities.\n\nThe Texas state comptroller\u2019s office nudged us to its web page showing 2009 property tax rates for every government unit in every county. We combined the 2009 rates for Austin, the Austin school district and Travis County and compared that to similar combined rates in the big cities of Arlington, Dallas, El Paso, Fort Worth, Houston and San Antonio. Austin\u2019s combined rate of $2.044 came out the lowest of the seven cities; next-lowest was San Antonio\u2019s combined rate of $2.137 with the highest proving Fort Worth\u2019s $2.441.\n\nUpshot: Austin\u2019s cost of living has consistently run ahead of most of the state\u2019s other big cities, but Austin wasn\u2019t No. 1 in the latest three-month period or 2010.\n\nThis statement includes another troubling facet. It\u2019s illogical to pin the relative cost of living on a one-term council member. In this instance, it would make just as much sense to say Shade personally drove down the cost of living.\n\nWe rate the statement Barely True.\nEditor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-12856"}
