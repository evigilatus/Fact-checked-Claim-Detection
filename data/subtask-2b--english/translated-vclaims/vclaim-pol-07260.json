It was among the Democrats who claimed that the obstacle had attacked the non-existent fraud and that it would disproportionately affect the low-income population and minorities. On 19 September 2014, Davis extended its criticism of the electoral identity - and Greg Abbott supported its opponent - by saying that Abbott was totally opposed to the Voting Rights Act 1965, which had been signed into law when Texan Lindon B. Johnson was President. At that time, the law was aimed at methods used to prevent African-Americans from voting. The Act provides that \"tests or tools\" cannot be developed among citizens and their voices, with examples such as literacy tests. Article 5 requires some jurisdictions - smaller states or political entities that have recently used these methods and voter participation or registration in the last presidential election is less than 50 per cent - to obtain federal approval before changing electoral laws. However, in 2013, this element was revoked by the United States Supreme Court with Abbott among the state prosecutors urging the decision. In the debate, Davis said Abbott was heading a party calling for his platform to repeal the law on voting rights. Is all this true? Davies is right about the platform adopted by delegates at the Texas Republican Party Congress in June 2014, which says: \"We urge the repeal of the Electoral Rights Act of 1965, which was codified and updated in 1973, and that it should not be re-authorised.\" However, this provision appears after another entry: \"We support equal voting for all United States citizens of voting age who are not criminals.\" Similar announcements appeared in the 2012 party programme - preference for non-person voting rights and the repeal of the Voting Rights Act. However, the platform adopted by delegates at the party forum in 2010 did not receive the call for its abolition. He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. \u2022 On January 12, 2012, we see how the Governor can be seen as running it or running his political party. However, the Republican Party of Texas is headed by Steve Monestere, a lawyer who is repeatedly elected by the delegates of the Congress for this position. While we did not find any news reports on Abbott's support or opposition to the 2014 cancellation board of the June 2014 news story in the San Antonio Express News, she quoted Monstery as saying: \"It's not Greg Abbott's platform. He has his own platform.\" The spokesman for the Abbott Avdel Huerta campaign then said that the Abbott platform emphasized jobs, education, roads, water and border security. The Abbott campaign did not respond to our queries as to whether Abbott would personally prefer to cancel. Our verdict, Davis, Abbott said, \"He's heading a party calling for his platform to repeal the law on voting rights.\" This claim is precise with regard to the State party &apos; s platform. However, Abbott may or may not support abolition; he is also not the head of his party, although it is fair to suggest that any governor has a role to play in guiding his party in the State.
