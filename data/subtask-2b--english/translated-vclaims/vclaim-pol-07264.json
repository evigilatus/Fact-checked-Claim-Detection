The announcement opens with fire on the screen and weeps the alarms in the background as a whistle with a deep voice: \"I've been called the lie of the year.\" The reference is to the 2013 National Polyte Vac lie, which President Barack Obama used to say about the affordable Care Act: \"If you like your health care plan, you can keep it.\" \"But while millions of doctors have lost their plans, Mary Burke says that she continues to support Obama's care programme unequivocally and wants to expand it.\" We'll check Walker's claim about Burke -- she says she supports the law \"undisputably\" and she wants to expand it. Of course, the Affordable Care Act is the signed Obama Act. Among its many provisions, the Health Care Reform Act provides for people to have health insurance, through an employer or a government programme or to purchase it through a government subsidy through an electronic market established as part of the Act. The Act also provides for the expansion of the Medicaid programme, the health-care programme for the poor run by the Federal Government and the states, by making millions more low-income people eligible to benefit from it. But Walker refused to expand in Wisconsin, saying he didn't trust the federal government to keep its promise to bear the vast majority of the costs. Obama has been in law since March 2010, but its provisions have entered into force in stages. One milestone took place on 1 October 2013 when electronic markets opened. That launch was badly distorted by technical problems. In April 2014, Walker's campaign cited the MSNBC article.com as a candidate for Governor Burke. It contained only one sentence on \"Obamakari\": \"Bourke is an unequivocal supporter of the Affordable Care Act and wants to expand the Medicaid program in the state, which Walker refused to do.\" There was no attribution to the statement, nor was there a quote from Burke for that purpose. On January 9, 2021, on Twitter, Sarah Goodlowski stated: \"Not all women lost jobs (in December's job report), most of them black and Latin women. In fact, white women got a job. On January 15, 2021, by Nosiaba Mezan, Walker's campaign began to capture the journalist's description, not Burke's own words. Also in April 2014, Burke was asked by Green Bay Press if she supported Obamakari. She said, as she has done on many occasions, that unlike Walker, she supports the Medicaid expansion part of the law. \"Well, what I support is that I had taken the Federal Medicaid money that Governor Walker rejected,\" she said. \"These are hundreds of millions of dollars a year that not only make health care more expensive in Wisconsin, but help to feed our economy.\" It should be noted that after explaining in detail what you consider to be the advantages of taking additional federal money, Burke referred to problems of starting up the market on the Internet. Of course. Obamacker has his problems. I mean, it was really hard,\" said Burke. And I think time will tell you how many people are going to sign up. The latest figures certainly seem quite encouraging. But we have to make sure it's a functioning system. It has to change if it doesn't work.\" The Walker Declaration contains some videos previously published by Wisconsin GOP of Burke, before its nomination, to defend Obama's care. But most often during the campaign, the Republicans tried to call Burke because her attitude towards Obama's care was unclear or because she was backing him back. In fact, while Burke was clear about her conflict with Walker about the expansion of the Medicaid programme, she generally avoided making comments on common law, although she expressed support. We asked Burke's campaign about Burke's attitude to Obama's care. A speaker in our tongue responded by referring to the comments made by Burke in an interview with the Green Bay newspaper. We also looked at some other Burke's statements. Asked in a television interview with Milwaukee in December 2013 if she supported the law in principle, Burke ignored the question. However, she said that Wisconsin should have created its own market on the Internet, or exchange, rather than having the people of Wisconsin use the federal market, which Walker chose to do. \"Look at how Minnesota dealt with this, and Minnesota was actually able to do so in a way that would benefit the people of Minnesota. We had the same opportunity here in Wisconsin, but first and foremost we needed to accept Federal Medicaid's money, she said. Similarly, in August 2014, Burke told the newspaper Milwakee Journal Sentinel: \"In our online insurance market, we could have negotiated with insurance companies to keep prices low. Obamaker has problems that need to be fixed, but we have to lower health-care costs to become a prosperous economy and 10 larger. Our assessment, Walker, says Burke says she unequivocally supports Obamacker and wants to expand it. Walker didn't provide any evidence that Burke expressed his unequivocal support for the Affordable Care Act, and we're not aware of any of it. At the same time, Burke supports the law, and she supports its expansion by making more people eligible for medical assistance. Walker &apos; s statement is partially accurate but does not contain important details. We value it half right.
