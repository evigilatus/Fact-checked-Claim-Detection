In a speech before the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, Kerry bemoaned a persistent misconception about how much money Washington sends overseas.\n\"Do you know that amazing surveys show that many of our citizens think we devote a full quarter or even a third of our federal budget to foreign aid?\" Kerry said on Oct. 26, 2016.\nForeign aid covers both military aid and more humanitarian forms of assistance such as fighting disease and boosting economic growth in other countries.\nKerry\u2019s comment accurately reflects what pollsters have seen for many years. Americans greatly exaggerate the scale of those items compared to everything else Washington spends on.\nTo do our part to set the record straight, this chart comes from numbers in the president\u2019s 2017 budget request. There are different ways to tally expenses across more than a dozen agencies, but by and large, foreign aid represents about 1 percent of all spending.\n\n\nTo support Kerry\u2019s claim, the State Department press office pointed to several reports including a recent survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a widely respected source of impartial data. In January 2016, Kaiser found that only 3 percent of Americans correctly estimated spending at 1 percent or less of total spending. The average answer was that foreign aid accounts for 31 percent of the U.S. budget; 15 percent of the people thought it represented over half of all spending.\n\u00a0\n\nThat misconception is a stubborn one.\nIn a 1998 survey, the average answer put foreign aid at 26 percent of the budget.\nAnd decades before that, nearly a quarter of respondents in a 1963 Gallup poll said Washington spends between 10 to 25 percent of its budget on foreign aid. Another 13 percent said it might go as high as half of all government spending.\nSo the surveys back-up Kerry\u2019s statement.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarcus Low\n\n\nstated on March 19, 2016 in an interview with a South African journalist\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Most funding for tuberculosis research (is) provided by the U.S. National Institutes for Health.\"\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jon Greenberg \u2022 April 5, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich raises the question, why do so many people get it wrong?\nThere are many possible reasons. The first and most obvious factor is that most Americans might not know much about foreign aid. In a 2010 poll, almost 70 percent said they had heard about the World Bank, but less that 30 percent had heard about the U.S. Agency for International Development, the government\u2019s main overseas health and development body.\nBoston College political scientist Emily Thorson points the finger at a more fundamental problem. It seems we aren\u2019t very good with numbers.\n\"People don\u2019t think in terms of percentages,\" Thorson said. \"We do best with \u2018more than\u2019 and 'less than.\u2019 And they also don\u2019t have a sense of how big the federal budget is. So if they hear we\u2019re spending billions, they don\u2019t see how that can be a small slice of the total.\"\nResearchers Helen Milner and Dustin Tingley, professors at Harvard and Princeton universities respectively, suggested that the way surveys ask about foreign aid might make that problem worse.\n\"No study that we are aware of asks individuals to assign percentages to an array of government programs, with a mandatory limit at 100 percent,\" they wrote in 2013.\nIn other words, asking only about foreign aid might lead people to ignore the big ticket budget lines for Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid and defense.\nIt\u2019s also possible, Thorson said, that news coverage that touches on aid can be graphic and compelling -- such as scenes from refugee camps or fighter jets in flight -- which leaves the impression that these programs play a bigger role in the budget than they actually do.\nOur ruling\nKerry said that surveys show that many Americans think that a quarter to a third of the U.S. budget is spent on foreign aid. The actual number is about 1 percent, and surveys back\u00a0up Kerry\u2019s statement. One 2016 poll found the average estimate was about 30 percent of all government spending. A survey done nearly two decades ago found an average estimate of 26 percent.\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong about Kerry\u2019s summary.\nWe rate this claim True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/abaebb34-ae3b-41cf-8c1c-6b7ed1c8a219", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03953"}
