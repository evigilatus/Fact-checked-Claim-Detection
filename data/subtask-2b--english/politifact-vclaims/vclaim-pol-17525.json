Michelle Obama voluntarily surrendered her law license in 1993 after a Federal Judge gave her a choice between surrendering her license or standing trial for insurance fraud.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe Obamas no longer hold active licenses to practice law, but they were not forced to surrender their licenses over any disciplinary proceedings.\nOn the website for the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission of the Supreme Court of Illinois, Barack Obama is listed as retired and was last registered in 2008. Michelle Obama is listed as voluntarily inactive and was last registered in 1993.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe website shows neither of the Obamas has any public record of discipline or pending proceedings. Steve Splitt, a spokesman for the commission, confirmed to PolitiFact that there is no record \"of any sort of disciplinary proceedings\" involving the Obamas.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s possible that the rumor spread because of the way Michelle Obama had to change her registration status. Prior to 1999, active lawyers were required to petition the court if they wanted to change their status, pursuant to Illinois Supreme Court rule 770. The online registration record previously listed Michelle Obama as being \"on court ordered inactive status.\"\n\"It used to be that if an attorney wanted to move from active to inactive they would need to file a motion with the court,\" Splitt said. \"Now, if they\u2019re thinking about moving to inactive or retired status, they will often do it at the beginning of the year during registration to pay a reduced fee, but it can also be done during the year.\"\nSplitt told us Michelle Obama filed a motion to transfer to inactive status in 1994. Barack Obama elected to have his license placed on inactive status after he announced his candidacy for president in 2007 and changed it to retired after becoming president in early 2009.\u00a0\nMeanwhile, the Illinois State Bar Association continues to list the Obamas as honorary members of the organization.\u00a0\nThere is no evidence that supports the claim that the Obamas were subjects of any disciplinary proceedings and were forced to give up their law licenses. Both changed their registration status voluntarily and remain in good standing with the Illinois Bar Association. We rate this post Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17525"}
