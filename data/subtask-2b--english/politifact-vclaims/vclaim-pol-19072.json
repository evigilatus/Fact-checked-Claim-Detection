This film really does cut into sort of the complications of the profession. How much thought do you put into a role like this when it comes to how law enforcement is represented?\"\nWashington responded by describing a ridealong he did with an officer when he was preparing for his role in another movie. Washington said he stayed in the car while the officer got out and encountered a distraught man with a gun, eventually diffusing the situation.\u00a0\n\"In an instant it taught me, and I never forgot it, what our law enforcement people have to deal with moment to moment, second to second, and I have the utmost respect for what they do, for what our soldiers do, that sacrifice their lives,\" Washington said. \"I just don\u2019t care for people that put those kinds of people down. If it weren\u2019t for them, we would not have the freedom to complain about what they do.\"\u00a0\nWhat he doesn\u2019t say?\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis quote that was attributed to him in a recent blog post headline: \"I support police over BLM, don\u2019t put them down!\"\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nWhile the post accurately says that Washington faced some backlash for his comments, he did not make that statement during the interview, and we couldn\u2019t find it reported elsewhere. A representative for Washington told Reuters that the quote is false.\nWashington did not mention Black Lives Matter during the interview, but he was asked about the movement during another interview in December 2016, at a premiere for his movie \"Fences.\" The interviewer that year wondered whether Washington thought the Black Lives Matter movement had helped race relations in the United States.\u00a0\nWashington skirted the question and said, \"Listen. We live in America, and in America we have the freedom to express ourselves. We shouldn\u2019t take that for granted. So whatever the movements are, whether you agree with them or don\u2019t, they have the right to express themselves. So that\u2019s one of the great things about being in this country, that you do have the right to protest.\"\nWe rate this headline Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19072"}
