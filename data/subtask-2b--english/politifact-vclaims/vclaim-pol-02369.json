But is their strike legal?\nShortly before the strike began, state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey (and U.S. Senate candidate) said it wasn\u2019t.\nOn Feb. 21, Morrisey tweeted, \" 'The impending work stoppage is unlawful and should come to an end.' \u2014 Patrick Morrisey.\"\nLegal experts said Morrisey is on solid ground about the lawfulness of the strike.\nAs the Charleston Gazette-Mail reported on Feb. 20, the key precedents on this case emerged in 1990, the last time teachers in West Virginia went on strike.\nOn March 8, 1990, then-Attorney General Roger W. Tompkins, a Democrat, wrote an opinion saying, \"There is no right to strike against the state. Thus, any strike or concerted work stoppage by the public teachers of this state is illegal. \u2026 It is our opinion that any strike by public teachers is illegal and may be dealt with accordingly by school officials.\"\nThe state Supreme Court essentially agreed with this reasoning in a ruling on April 12, 1990.\n\"Public employees have no right to strike in the absence of express legislation or, at the very least, appropriate statutory provisions for collective bargaining, mediation, and arbitration,\" the court wrote. \"In view of our legislature's silence on these complex issues, we decline to intervene.\"\nThe West Virginia Education Association, the state affiliate of the National Education Association, the national teacher's union,\u00a0did not respond to an inquiry for this article. When the group\u2019s president, Dale Lee, was previously asked whether a strike was illegal, Lee acknowledged \"Probably yes,\" according to the Gazette-Mail.\nMorrisey\u2019s tweet was carefully worded, legal experts say.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf he had used the word \"illegal,\" he might have been open to critique on the grounds that teachers would not be committing a crime by taking part.\n\"I know of nothing that says a teacher who strikes commits a crime,\" said West Virginia University law professor Bob Bastress. \"Participating in a strike would be no different from a teacher who feigns illness to get a day off. The conduct could expose the teacher to discipline.\"\nHoward Seufer Jr., an attorney in Charleston, agreed. \"Strikes by public employees are not crimes in our state,\" he said. \"But public employees do not enjoy a right under our laws to strike.\"\nOn another linguistic note, Seufer pointed out that the 1990 state Supreme Court ruling specifically noted that it was using the terms \"strike\" and \"work stoppage\" interchangably. That aligns with a 1965 opinion by the same court, which \"suggested that a \u2018strike\u2019 refers to the actions of employees that may result in such a work stoppage,\" Seufer said.\nIf it sounds unusual for a union to be unable to strike, that\u2019s the case in West Virginia.\nUnions in West Virginia, including the WVEA, \"exist as voluntary associations that lobby on behalf of their members and provide them with certain services, such as representation in grievance and disciplinary proceedings,\" Seufer said. \"But our laws do not treat these associations as unions in the same sense other states do.\"\nSpecifically, West Virginia law does not recognize a right for public school employees to collectively bargain, he said. Rather, the legislature regulates public school labor by statute.\nBastress said that common law applies on the issue of strikes, \"and there is no right to strike in common law.\"\nOur ruling\nReferring to a West Virginia teacher\u2019s strike, Morrisey tweeted that \"the impending work stoppage is unlawful.\"\nPrecedents both from his own office and from the state Supreme Court support that view, and Morrisey was careful to say \"unlawful\" rather than \"illegal.\" By going on strike, the teachers are not taking part in criminal activity; they are at risk of disciplinary action.\nWe rate the statement True.\n Share the Facts 2018-02-26 22:12:30 UTC   PolitiFact    6 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: True  \"The impending work stoppage is unlawful.\"    Patrick Morrisey West Virginia attorney general https://twitter.com/MorriseyWV/status/966430752685600768   a tweet Wednesday, February 21, 2018 2018-02-21    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02369"}
