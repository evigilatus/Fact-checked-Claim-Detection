0205	Donald Trump	But let me give you the bad, the sad news.
0206	Donald Trump	Moments ago, I learned that a district judge in Hawaii  part of the much overturned 9th Circuit Court  and I have to be nice otherwise I'll get criticized for speaking poorly about our courts.
0207	Donald Trump	I'll be criticized by these people, among the most dishonest people in the world  I will be criticized  I'll be criticized by them for speaking harshly about our courts.
0208	Donald Trump	I would never want to do that.
0209	Donald Trump	A judge has just blocked our executive order on travel and refugees coming into our country from certain countries.
0210	Audience	Booo 
0211	Donald Trump	The order he blocked was a wateredversion of the first order that was also blocked by another judge and should have never been blocked to start with.
0212	Donald Trump	This new order was tailored to the dictates of the 9th Circuit's  in my opinion  flawed ruling.
0213	Donald Trump	This is, the opinion of many, an unprecedented judicial overreach.
0214	Donald Trump	The law and the Constitution give the President the power to suspend immigration when he deems  or she  or she.
0215	Donald Trump	Fortunately, it will not be Hillary she.
0216	SYSTEM	[Applause]

0219	Donald Trump	We also have a lot of smart people here.
0220	Donald Trump	Let me read to you directly from the federal statute, 212F, of the immigration  and you know what I'm talking about, right?
0221	Donald Trump	Can I read this to you?
0222	Donald Trump	Listen to this.
0223	Donald Trump	Now, we're all smart people.
0224	Donald Trump	We're all good students  some are bad students, but even if you're a bad student this is a real easy one, let me tell you.
0225	Donald Trump	Ready?
0226	Donald Trump	So here's the statute  which they don't even want to quote when they overrule it.
0227	Donald Trump	And it was put here for the security of our country.
0228	Donald Trump	And this goes beyond me, because there will be other Presidents, and we need this.
0229	Donald Trump	And sometimes we need it very badly for security  security of our country.
0230	Donald Trump	It says  now, listen how easy this is.
0231	Donald Trump	Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or any class of aliens would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may, by proclamation, and for such period as he  see, it wasn't politically correct, because it should say he or she.
0232	Donald Trump	You know, today they'd say that.
0233	Donald Trump	Actually, that's the only mistake they made.
0234	Donald Trump	as he shall deem necessary, suspending entry of all aliens, or any class of aliens, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or pose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deems to be appropriate."
0235	Donald Trump	In other words, if he thinks there's danger out there, he or she  whoever is President  can say, I'm sorry, folks, not now, please.
0236	Donald Trump	We've got enough problems.

0244	Donald Trump	No.
0245	Audience	Booo 
0246	Donald Trump	This ruling makes us look weak  which, by the way, we no longer are, believe me.

0308	Donald Trump	I remember years ago, I'd go to Washington  I was always very politically active  and Republicans and Democrats, they'd fight during the day and they go to dinner at night.
0309	Donald Trump	Today, there's a level that nobody has seen before.
0310	Donald Trump	Just remember this If we submitted the Democrats' plan, drawn everything perfect for the Democrats, we wouldn't get one vote from the Democrats.
0311	Donald Trump	That's the way it is.
0312	Donald Trump	That's how much divisiveness and other things there are.
0313	Donald Trump	So it's a problem.

0330	Donald Trump	So we'll see.
0331	Donald Trump	It's the fake, fake media.
0332	Donald Trump	We want Americans to be able to purchase the health insurance plans they want, not the plans forced on them by our government.
0333	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0334	Donald Trump	The House has put forward a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare based on the principles I outlined in my joint address, but let me tell you, we're going to arbitrate, we're going to all get together and we're going to get something done.
0335	Donald Trump	Remember this  if we didn't do it the way we're doing it, we need 60 votes so we have to get the Democrats involved.
0336	Donald Trump	They won't vote, no matter what we do, they're not going to vote.
0337	Donald Trump	So we're doing it a different way, a complex way.
