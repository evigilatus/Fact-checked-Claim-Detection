Gwen Moore was interviewed Aug. 15, 2016 on MSNBC.\nThere was this exchange between talk show host Lawrence O\u2019Donnell and the Milwaukee Democrat:\nO\u2019Donnell: One of the things that the history of this subject shows everywhere in the United States, is that when you get a violent community reaction like this, it is never for that one individual incident, it's always an accumulation of past grievances that have not been satisfactorily addressed in terms of the community's understanding of them, at least. Is that the case in Milwaukee?\nMoore: Oh, absolutely, Lawrence. You know, we have one of the youngest African-American populations in the country. And the dearth of resources for summer jobs, for economic well being, for basic things like the ability to pay rent for women and the high incarceration rate for black males. We have the highest incarceration rate among African-American men in the country. And it creates a powder keg.\nSimilar claims were made by other Milwaukee Democrats, including state Sen. Lena Taylor on CNN, and have been reported by national media.\nSo, does Milwaukee have the nation\u2019s highest incarceration rate for black males?\nThere is data to indicate that Milwaukee ranks very high.\nBut there isn\u2019t city-level data on a national level to know whether it ranks highest.\nMoore\u2019s evidence\nTo back Moore\u2019s claim, her office cited a study from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee entitled \"Wisconsin\u2019s Mass Incarceration of African American Males: Workforce Challenges for 2013.\" It has been widely cited, but its major finding is about Wisconsin, not Milwaukee, and it is dated.\nThe study said that as of 2010, 12.8 percent of working-age African-American men were in state prisons or local jails -- the highest such rate in the country, with Oklahoma ranking second.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in remarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe study also said that in Milwaukee County, over half of African-American men in their 30s and half in their early 40s had been incarcerated in state correctional facilities at some point in the past.\nOther experts\nKeith Humphreys, a Stanford University psychiatry professor who has written on the black incarceration rate, and Marc Mauer, executive director of The Sentencing Project, said the UWM study appears to be solid research. They also said both Milwaukee and Wisconsin have high rates of black male incarceration.\nBut they and University of Wisconsin-Madison sociology professor Pamela Oliver, \u00a0whose research work includes the Wisconsin Racial Disparities Project, told us there simply isn\u2019t city-level data nationally in order to rank Milwaukee.\nOliver said it\u2019s likely Milwaukee would rank high among larger U.S. cities with large black populations, but that \"many members of the general public incorrectly assume that because 70 percent of Wisconsin\u2019s black people live in Milwaukee County that anything that is true about Wisconsin really refers to Milwaukee. It is more complicated than that.\"\nMauer noted that his organization, which works to address racial disparities, reported in June 2016 that -- among black males and females -- Wisconsin has the second-highest rate of black incarceration in the nation, behind Oklahoma.\n(Unlike the UWM study, the Sentencing Project study didn\u2019t include local jails. And no local-level data was reported.)\nOur rating\nMoore said: Milwaukee has \"the highest incarceration rate among African-American men in the country.\"\nThere are indications that Milwaukee has a very high black male incarceration rate, including a 2016 study that ranks Wisconsin ranks second in the incarceration of black males and females in state prisons.\nBut there are no local-level data on a national basis to determine exactly where Milwaukee ranks.\nFor a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/91b436b6-67cf-4226-ac00-c6d946b6808c", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04397"}
