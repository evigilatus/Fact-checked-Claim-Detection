Scott Walker couldn\u2019t resist an extra jab on jobs.\nIn the spot sponsored by the Republican Governors Association, which began running Sept. 23, 2014, the narrator points to Wisconsin job losses during the Great Recession.\n\"The truth is Burke\u2019s record is one of failure and job loss, with plagiarism to cover it up,\" the narrator says. \"Don\u2019t go backwards with Mary Burke.\"\nAs the words are spoken, this message fills the screen:\n\"Burke\u2019s record: 130,000 fewer jobs.\"\nIt\u2019s a familiar figure to us -- and probably to most voters by now.\nOn the campaign trail, Walker has repeatedly juxtaposed the 100,000-plus jobs added during his first term with the total job loss in the last term under his Democratic predecessor, Jim Doyle, who left office after 2010.\nBurke served as commerce secretary under Doyle for about three years.\nIn an earlier factcheck of a Walker claim that Doyle\u2019s policies in his last term \"saw the state lose more than 133,000 jobs,\" we found the number to be accurate -- Doyle\u2019s second term saw a drop of 133,943 jobs.\nBut the claim was far off on the blame game. As such, we rated the claim Mostly False.\nEconomists agreed that Wisconsin\u2019s economy was caught in the same economic crash that crippled the entire country. The recession was deeper and more severe than any single state\u2019s policies, including those of Doyle. And, notably, Wisconsin actually fared somewhat better than the rest of the country.\nBut there are even bigger problems with the RGA taking a figure for Doyle\u2019s last term and applying it to Burke.\nHer time as head of Commerce spanned parts of both Doyle\u2019s terms, and she only served for 10 months of the four-year term the RGA associates with the 130,000 job loss.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Godlewski\n\n\nstated on January 9, 2021 in Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all women that lost jobs (in the December jobs report), it was mostly Black and Latina women. In fact, white women gained employment.\u201d\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Nusaiba Mizan \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndeed, she wasn\u2019t even around when the job losses started coming.\nBurke started in February 2005 and left in November 2007 -- shortly before the downturn. Nationally, the Great Recession began in December 2007, but Wisconsin didn\u2019t see a decline in quarterly jobs figures until mid 2008.\nThe state saw jobs turnaround in 2010, the last year Doyle was in office, and annual growth has continued under Walker.\nBurke\u2019s time at Commerce\nSo, what happened with jobs while Burke was at the helm of Commerce?\nStatistics show Wisconsin added between 43,500 and 59,100 private-sector positions during Burke\u2019s time in state government, depending on which federal data source is analyzed.\nTo be sure, a governor\u2019s policies have limited impact on increases or decreases in jobs, given the many factors that drive a state\u2019s economy. And, as we have noted previously, a Commerce secretary\u2019s influence would be even smaller.\nBut even if all that were set aside, and the RGA is right to attach all of Doyle\u2019s second-term numbers to Burke, what about the other side of the coin? After all, she also served during Doyle\u2019s first term. Shouldn\u2019t those be included as well?\nThe state gained 86,530 jobs in Doyle\u2019s first term from 2003 through 2006, so when combined with the losses of the second term, the final score for Doyle\u2019s eight years was a \u00a0loss of 47,000 jobs.\nNot good. But also not 130,000.\nOur rating\nThe Republican Governors Association said Mary Burke\u2019s record is one of \"130,000 fewer jobs.\"\nBut that number corresponds to Doyle\u2019s second term, not Burke\u2019s time as head of Commerce -- a period that saw an increase. Even with the most charitable of possible interpretations, the number is wrong.\nWe rate the claim False\n(Read our tipsheet on five things to watch for when you hear jobs claims)", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07208"}
