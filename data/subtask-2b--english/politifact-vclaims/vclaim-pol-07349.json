The latest figure was 4.1 percent.\nThat appears to back Obama's statement.\nBut let's examine this in detail.\nTo do that, we reviewed figures published by the Congressional Budget Office as well as the White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget. We also consulted with independent fiscal experts.\nThe baseline year for comparison is fiscal year 2009, which ended Sept. 30 of that year. This was the last budget from President George W. Bush, as Obama took office in January of that year.\nThe most recent complete fiscal year is 2013.\nThose are the same years Obama's chart showed.\nOur analysis showed the drop easily topped 50 percent, and was actually somewhat higher than Obama's chart would indicate.\nAs a share of the economy, we found -- and our experts confirmed -- the drop was from 9.8 percent in 2009 to 4.1 percent in 2013.\nObama\u2019s chart actually reflects a lower deficit figure for 2009, and therefore a lower share of GDP, 9.2%.\nThat\u2019s because instead of using the actual 2009 deficit of $1.4 trillion, Obama lowers it by the $200 billion in increased deficit spending that he -- not Bush -- pushed through in the stimulus plan to address the crisis that became the Great Recession. That resulting figure is what Obama calls the deficit he \"inherited\" from Bush.\nBut no matter which figure is used, the deficit as a share of the economy still fell by more than half.\nShow me the money\nThere's another way to look at this.\nThat is, in raw dollars -- the way attendees at the union event probably would. Indeed, deficits are often expressed that way as well.\nThe White House and CBO figures each show that in 2009 the deficit reached $1.4 trillion.\nAs a share of GDP, it easily topped any year since World War II, said Steve\nEllis, vice president of the nonpartisan Taxpayers for Common Sense.\nBy the end of fiscal year 2013, the deficit figure had fallen to $679.5 billion in dollars unadjusted for inflation.\nThat\u2019s a 52 percent drop.\nHere\u2019s the year-by-year trend in 2009 dollars:\n\n\n\n\nFiscal year\n\n\nDeficit\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeficit as share of GDP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2009\n\n\n1,412,688,000,000\n\n\n9.8 percent\n\n\n\n\n2010\n\n\n1,294,373,000,000\n\n\n8.8 percent\n\n\n\n\n2011\n\n\n1,299,593,000,000\n\n\n8.4 percent\n\n\n\n\n2012\n\n\n1,086,963,000,000\n\n\n6.8 percent\n\n\n\n\n2013\n\n\n679,502,000,000\n\n\n4.1 percent\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nThere is one wrinkle.\nWhen you use Obama's methodology to compare the deficit Obama inherited -- the 2009 result minus the stimulus package to that in 2013 -- \u00a0the drop in the deficit is slightly under half, at 48%.\nEllis and Marc Goldwein, senior policy director at the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, both included an additional year, the 2014 fiscal year, which is just a month from completion.\nThe Aug. 27, 2014 CBO estimate for this year\u2019s budget, fiscal year 2014, is a continued shrinking of the deficit to $506 billion, or 2.9 percent of GDP.\nThose figures would put Obama's claim over the top no matter the number-crunching method.\nLooking ahead\nEllis cautioned that talking about deficit amounts in raw dollars doesn\u2019t really give a good sense of the scale: \"A $400 billion deficit in a $10 trillion economy is a lot bigger than a $400 billion deficit in $17 trillion economy.\"\nAnd he and Goldwein emphasized that while the deficit has been halved, it\u2019s been halved from a skyscraping peak.\nIn the decade before deficits exploded in 2008 and 2009, they averaged just over 1 percent of GDP, including three years of surpluses, we calculated.\nAs of 2013, that figure was at 4.1 percent.\nThe growth in the deficit from 2007 to 2009 was due mainly to factors related to the Great Recession, said Goldwein. Tax collections fell as people lost jobs and corporate profits dropped; spending on food stamps and other aid programs rose with increased need; stimulus and tax break legislation passed, as did bailouts of financial firms.\n\"The economic recovery, wind-down of stimulus, reversal of TARP/Fannie transactions, and lower interest rates are really what has caused our deficit to fall so much,\" Goldwein told us. He mentioned cuts in discretionary spending as well.\nLooking ahead, the CBO warns that later in the next decade deficits as a share of the economy will grow and federal debt will climb without changes in current policies.\nBut Obama, it\u2019s fair to say, was speaking of the change during his presidency.\nAnd his claim dovetails with one PolitiFact National checked in July 2013, rating True Obama\u2019s claim that the deficit is falling at the fastest rate in 60 years.\nOur rating\nAt a union rally on Labor Day, Obama declared \"We cut our deficits by more than half.\"\nThe numbers back up Obama\u2019s claim: \u00a0Thanks to income tax revenues rising and spending on emergency assistance dropping, America\u2019s deficit has fallen by more than 50 percent\nfrom its highest point since World War II to a level $733 billion lower.\nWe rate the claim True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07349"}
