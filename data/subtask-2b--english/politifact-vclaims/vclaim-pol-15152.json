Rick Perry cites GOP complaint against Democratic foe Bill White for not reporting $83,000 to state", "text": "GOP Gov. Rick Perry\u2019s campaign excels at producing provocative videos, the latest one attacking Democratic gubernatorial nominee Bill White with excerpts from Texas TV newscasts about a Republican complaint against White.\nA link to the \u201cLiberal Bill\u201d video went to reporters on Friday accompanied by this message: \u201cThis week liberal Bill White faced an ethics complaint about more than $83,000 he failed to report to the state Ethics Commission.\u201d\nUndisputed: Such a complaint was filed by the Perry-allied Republican Party of Texas. The commission hasn't ruled on it.\nUnproven: Perry's characterization of White as \"liberal.\" That label, which isn't backed up in Perry's statement or the video, might not reflect White's record. For now, we'll let the word slide as a rhetorical swipe.\nOur lingering question: Did White fail to report more than $83,000 to the state, as Perry's campaign says?\nIn a March 23 complaint to the Texas Ethics Commission, Cathie Adams, who chairs the Republican Party, states that White\u2019s state-required personal financial statement, submitted in February, lists no income received in 2009 from Wedge Services, LLC though White separately reported $83,677 in wages from Wedge Services on his 2009 federal tax return.\nWhite acknowledges that his tax return, which he recently made public, specifies his Wedge Services\u2019 income as part of \u201cWages Received and Taxes Withheld.\u201d He also admits that his personal financial statement doesn\u2019t have an entry showing Wedge paying him.\nBut, White says, there\u2019s a reasonable explanation; he wasn\u2019t required to detail his Wedge Services\u2019 income\u2014which was deferred compensation\u2014on his personal financial statement in the way it's spelled out on his tax return. White last worked for the company in 2003.\nWhile there's no one entry on the financial statement showing Wedge Services paying White, his campaign says the income came from a brokerage account, invested in stocks and mutual funds, that was established for his deferred compensation. We confirmed that a list of the stocks and funds provided by White's campaign is on his ethics filing. While it's possible to estimate how many shares of stock White's family had in five entities plus the number of shares he had in three mutual funds, the form doesn't show the total value of such holdings or precisely how much income they produced.\nBut proceeds are shown in categories such as $5,000 to $9,999. The categories enable anyone (provided they get help from the White campaign identifying relevant stocks and mutual funds) to estimate that White took in $36,500 to $94,992 in 2009 due to his holdings in the Wedge-originated brokerage account.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a March 25 sworn statement, White states the \u201cproper recording\u201d took place with the commission based on instructions for filing the statement and conversations with commission attorneys before and after the filing.\nConfusing? There's a reason.\nThe Texas law governing personal financial statements doesn\u2019t speak explicitly to reporting deferred compensation. Broadly, the relevant section (which runs about 900 words) states that each statement must reflect the filing individual\u2019s financial activity in the preceding calendar year including a list of \u201call sources of occupational income.\" Filers must identify any person or group from which they received fees or retainers paid in advance of future services. They also must report income from stocks, bonds, notes and other commercial paper, plus each source of more than $500 from interest, dividends, royalties and rents. There's more to report, according to the law, but there's no mention of deferred compensation.\nWe found no past commission opinions on whether filers have to specify income from deferred compensation. Austin lawyer Buck Wood, an expert on ethics law, agreed there's nothing on the record. \"That's a new one on me,\" Wood said.\nCould White have reported the money from Wedge Services to the state in the same way he did on his federal tax return anyway? Of course\u2014if only to avoid shots like the one fired by the Texas GOP. Not the point, his campaign said, stressing that White consulted accountants to make sure he complied with the law.\nWhite spokeswoman Katy Bacon said a CPA for White spoke to an attorney for the ethics commission the day after the GOP filed its complaint. Bacon said Robert Mannas, an assistant general counsel for the commission, told the CPA, Nancy Wakefield, that White had reported his income correctly. Bacon said the commission's general counsel, Natalia Luna Ashley, later cautioned that Mannas's advice didn't constitute a ruling on the complaint.\nCommission spokesman Tim Sorrells declined to comment on Bacon's account. Generally, Sorrells said, whether anyone has complied with relevant laws and commission rules is a call for the agency's eight appointed commission members to make.\nSo, where does this leave Perry\u2019s statement?\nWhite does face a complaint, but Perry's statement leaves out a key piece of context: That complaint was filed by the GOP.\nAnd it's misleading to conclude, as Perry's statement does, that White failed to report more than $83,000 to the commission. White's camp said he accounted for his deferred compensation as directed. The law doesn't specify if or how candidates should report deferred compensation.\nWe rate Perry\u2019s statement as Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-15152"}
