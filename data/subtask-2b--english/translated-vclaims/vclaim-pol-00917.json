But is it possible that Irving has more than 500 profit companies per person? Fortune 500 versus Fortune 1000 when asked the spokesman for Abbott John Whitman said that Abbott had misspoked and was meant to say that Irving Las Collenas was home to the most 1,000 companies in terms of per capita wealth. We checked the location of the Chamber of Commerce at Irving-Las Collenas to see if they were tracking this information and found a statement describing the city as \"headquarters, where there are 1,000 more people at Headquarters than any other city in the United States.\" Erica Mulder, Deputy Head of Government Affairs and Communications of the Chamber, said that officials had come to this conclusion by calculating their per capita rate and then considering the rate of other cities. Mulder did not respond to multiple requests for comments for more detailed information on how to make such a comparison. On Friday morning, after Polyte Fact Texas exchanged e-mails with room officials, the prosecution was no longer visible on the web page. In the original claim of Abbott, Irving said that it had more than 500 companies per capita from any other city in the country. Therefore, we examined the list of 500 Fortunes and their headquarters provided by Fortune magazine and the latest available population estimates for each city of the Census Bureau. Irving is home to seven companies on the Fortune 500 list, and the latest estimate from the Census Bureau shows that its population is 240,373. This means that there are about three wealth companies per 100,000 people in Irving. This is where things get complicated. On January 16, 2021, Jordan Rachel stated in Tweedda that the minimum wage of $15 per hour would raise the price of taco bill burrito to $38. By Bill McCarthy: January 20, 2021, considering cumulatively the list of places where there are at least 500 Fortune companies, there are dozens of cities and towns with a higher proportion of companies and people from Irving, according to our analysis. These include places such as Mayfield, Ohio and Bloomfield Hills, Mitch, both of which have one headquarters for Fortune 500 but have a small population (3,408 and 3,990 respectively). This means that the per capita value in Mayfield village is 29 per 100,000 and the per capita value in Bloomfield Hills is 25 per 100,000. However, in order to gain a better understanding of how the number of companies per capita in Irving is compared to other cities, it is logical to measure Irving more than cities of similar size. Given the list of cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants and with at least one Fortune 500 company, Irving has the largest number of headquarters per capita. However, the claim by the Chamber of Commerce of Irving Las Collenas and Abbott's spokesman that the city has the largest 1,000 fortune companies per capita in any city in the United States is inaccurate no matter what you look at it. With all headquarters locations in this mix, Irving is nowhere near having more than 1,000 profit companies per capita. When you compare them to cities of similar size, those with over 100,000 people, there are two cities with 1,000 wealth companies per capita more than Irving: Santa Clara, Califf, Stamford, Kon. So what? Abbott said that Irving had more than 500 wealth companies per capita than any city in the country during a speech paying tribute to state-wide and local economic development efforts in Texas. Nathan Jensen, a government professor at the University of Texas in Austin studying economic development strategies, saw the number of Fortune 500 companies in a given city \"not a measure that most academics consider to be of special value.\" Jensen said that the best measure of economic success or vitality of a city or region was to look at factors such as unemployment and wage growth. \"There is a lot of criticism in academic literature in focusing on how many \"processes\" are being performed, rather than thinking carefully about how policies and business influence society,\" said Jensen in e-mail. At a press conference celebrating the economic success of the State, Abbott said, \"On an individual basis, Irving Las Collenas has more than 500 Fortune companies from any city in the United States of America.\" We did the math and his claim wrong if you look everywhere with at least one 500 fortune company. However, when you make more logical comparisons with cities of similar size (the population of more than 100,000), Irving has more than 500 profit companies per capita. We're mostly assessing this claim right. In fact, this statement is accurate but requires further clarification or information.
