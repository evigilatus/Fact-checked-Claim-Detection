Scott Walker released his political memoir, Wisconsin Democratic Party chairman Mike Tate used a fund-raising email to highlight what\u2019s not in the book.\nHe claimed Walker is doing a number of things badly, including:\n\"Failing at job creation and dropping Wisconsin to 45th in the nation in job growth prospects while campaigning for president out of state.\"\nThe Nov. 17, 2013, solicitation cites a low ranking and pins the blame squarely on Walker.\nIs Tate right?\nTate's evidence \nWe asked Democratic Party spokeswoman Melissa Baldauff to flesh out the claim.\nShe said Walker has been campaigning out of state for president since at least March 2013, when Walker told Politico at the Conservative Political Action Conference, where he gave a speech, that he would be visiting Iowa in May 2013. Walker at the time (and since) acknowledged he was open to a presidential bid and he declined to pledge to serve a full four-year term if re-elected governor in 2014.\nAlthough Walker hasn\u2019t declared himself a candidate for president, nor formed an exploratory committee, he has made many political trips across the country during 2013 and is increasingly mentioned as a potential GOP nominee, particularly since the release of his book.\nAs for Wisconsin dropping to 45th in job growth prospects, Baldauff cited Forbes\u2019 annual \"best states for business\" feature, published in September 2013. Wisconsin's projected annual job growth was put at 1.3% over the next five years.\n\"The Badger State adopted the slogan of 'Open for Business' in 2011, erecting signs along the state border,\" Forbes said. \"Results have been slow, but Wisconsin\u2019s projected job growth has improved slightly, moving from No. 49 to No. 45 among the states.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, one study ranks Wisconsin 45th for future job prospects, as Tate stated.\nBut contrary to what he claimed, the state\u2019s ranking actually rose, albeit not by much.\nOther rankings\nA May 2013 report from the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council ranked Wisconsin 15th in \"economic outlook,\" up from 32nd a year earlier, based on 15 policy variables such as taxes.\nBut that report didn\u2019t rank the states on future job growth and we didn\u2019t find any others that did. \u00a0Several experts we checked with -- at the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Wisconsin Budget Project and the Center on Wisconsin Strategy -- weren\u2019t aware of any, either.\nAs for the rest of Tate\u2019s claim, he directly blames Walker, even suggesting his political travels were a contributing factor.\nBut it goes without saying that the state\u2019s projected job growth depends on more than the actions of one person.\nAs we\u2019ve noted in previous fact-checks, a chief executive such as a governor has influence over jobs, but so do a host of other factors, such as national trends, that are beyond a governor\u2019s control.\nOur rating\nTate said Walker has dropped Wisconsin \"to 45th in the nation in job growth prospects while campaigning for president out of state.\"\nForbes rates Wisconsin 45th, although that\u2019s a slight improvement, not a drop. And Walker bears some, but not all of the blame, for the ranking.\nFor a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we give Tate a Mostly False.\nTo comment on this item, go to the Journal Sentinel website.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08552"}
