(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe story was largely lifted from Fox News and repeated by Trump and other websites.\n\"Just out that the Obama Administration granted citizenship, during the terrible Iran Deal negotiation, to 2,500 Iranians - including to government officials. How big (and bad) is that?\" tweeted Trump, who announced in May that the United States was pulling out of the agreement to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions.\nWe found that the claim lacks evidence. Our fact-checking friends at Factnameh, a Canada-based website that fact-checks claims about Iran, found that the statement by the Iranian official has no evidence to back it up.\nFactnameh.com found that the original source of the claim was an anti-regime website called Amad News. It published the claim on Feb. 14, 2017, quoting an anonymous \"informed source.\"\nFox News attributed report to one Iranian official\nFox News attributed its report to Hojjat al-Islam Mojtaba Zolnour, chairman of Iran\u2019s parliamentary nuclear committee and a member of its national security and foreign affairs committee.\nZolnour made the allegations during an interview with the country\u2019s Etemad newspaper, cited by the country\u2019s Fars News agency, a \"semi-official\" organ of the Iranian government.\nZolnour claimed that the citizenships were granted as a favor to senior Iranian officials linked to President Hassan Rouhani, Fox said.\n\"When Obama, during the negotiations about the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, commonly referred to as the Iran deal), decided to do a favor to these men, he granted citizenship to 2,500 Iranians and some officials started a competition over whose children could be part of these 2,500 Iranians,\" he claimed.\nFox News analyst and former Obama State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf told Fox News, \"This sounds like totally made up B.S.\"\nOther officials in the Obama administration also said the statement was false.\nRichard Nephew, who works for Columbia University and was the State Department\u2019s lead sanctions expert from August 2013 to December 2014, told PolitiFact that the claim \"is entirely nonsense.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It would have made no sense for us to have done this and less sense for the officials to have agreed/requested citizenship,\" he said. \"While I was on the team, this wasn't even discussed, considered or thought about. I would bet any sum you'd care to wager that this didn't come up after I left the talks. And, it is worth noting that after years of congressional inquiry into this, we never heard of it. I find it hard to believe that's because this one opposition politician in Iran was the only person who knew about it.\"\nSuzanne Maloney, deputy director of the Foreign Policy Program at the Brookings Institution, who served on State\u2019s Policy Planning Staff from 2005-07, also expressed disbelief. (She held a part-time outside advisor role during the early part of Obama\u2019s administration.)\nMaloney said the issue of U.S. citizenship or green cards has long been a contentious one within the Iranian establishment. There are a few Iranians within the ruling establishment who have or had U.S. citizenship or permanent residency, typically dating from the pre-revolutionary period.\nThere are also Iranian officials whose children have attended U.S. universities and stayed in the United States, or married dual nationals and obtained residency or citizenship.\n\"Given the longstanding estrangement between the U.S. and Iran, the allegation alone is used as a smear, to impugn the patriotism and question the motives of rival officials by essentially accusing them of hypocrisy and ideological opportunism,\" she said.\nZolnour is a hard-line cleric, she said.\n\"So it\u2019s not surprising that a politician who is critical of the nuclear deal would use this line of attack, especially in the aftermath of President Trump\u2019s dismantling of the deal, which has generated an intense backlash toward the proponents of the agreement,\" Maloney said. \"And yes, Iranians of all political stripes are prone to indulging fairly creative conspiracy theories, especially hardliners and especially conspiracy theories about the U.S.\"\nAli Vaez, the anti-war Crisis Group's Iran Project Director, told PoltiiFact that Zolnour is a firebrand who is well known for his false claims.\nVaez said that Zolnour is using this claim to undermine President Hassan Rouhani and his allies as the parliament is trying to pass a bill to ban dual-nationals from serving in the Iranian government.\nWe emailed the Diamond and Silk website and did not get a reply. The Department of Homeland Security declined to comment to Fox News, and we didn\u2019t get a reply to our email. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert was asked about Trump\u2019s tweet at the July 3 press briefing and referred reporters to homeland security.\nOur ruling\nA headline on a Diamond and Silk\u00a0website said \"Obama secretly gave citizenship to 2,500 Iranians as part of nuke deal.\"\nThe article stemmed from a Fox News report which was based on comments by Hojjat al-Islam Mojtaba Zolnour, an Iranian official, who made the allegation during an interview with the country\u2019s Etemad newspaper, cited by the country\u2019s semi-official Fars News agency. The report doesn\u2019t appear to include any actual evidence.\nFox News\u2019 report contained no confirmation by U.S. government officials working in the Trump administration. Former Obama administration officials denied the report and experts expressed skepticism.\nWe rate claims based on available evidence, and so far have found none to support the claim.\nWe rate this statement False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9e1cc953-44f5-4364-9a00-127ad94473d5", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01890"}
