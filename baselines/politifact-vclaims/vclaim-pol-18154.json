Kelly Alexander, a Democrat from Mecklenburg County, suggested on Twitter that legislators should consider video conferencing. The start of the legislature\u2019s session is scheduled for April 28.\nAlexander posted his tweet on March 11. That same day the World Health Organization labeled the spread of the novel coronavirus as a \"pandemic,\" prompting a wave of event cancellations and changes across the globe.\n\"With a vaccine a year in the future the General Assembly should use more teleconferences and fewer in person meetings to cut down on potential exposure...after all most of the GA\u2019s members are in the high risk age group,\" Alexander tweeted, adding: \"besides we need to modernize...just saying.\"\n\nIs it true that \"most\" of North Carolina\u2019s legislators are in the \"high risk age group?\"\nAlexander never responded to an email from PolitiFact, so we don\u2019t know how he came to his conclusion.\nRegardless, his tweet is on-point.\nAt-risk ages\nFirst, let\u2019s first look at what health experts say about the novel coronavirus (also known as COVID-19) and who\u2019s most at-risk.\u00a0\nThe virus causes a fever, cough and shortness of breath in people anywhere from two to 14 days after exposure, according to the the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC says people with chronic medical conditions such as heart disease, diabetes or lung disease are most at-risk.\nAs for age, there\u2019s no specific birth date at which people become more vulnerable. Generally speaking: the older you are, the more likely you are to have complications from the novel coronavirus.\nThat said, top health organizations have defined \"older adults\" as people who are at least 60 years old.\nThe CDC has previously, in a document unrelated to the coronavirus, defined older adults as those over 60. The World Health Organization specifically mentioned people over 60 in its recent report on the coronavirus outbreak in China.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth experts recently told CNN that the term \"older\" typically refers to anyone over 60. And US Surgeon General Jerome Adams said 60 is the \"average age of people who need medical attention.\"\nIt also appears that people older than 60 are more susceptible to complications from the virus.\nScientific American reported that patients in China were more at-risk of death if they developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, known as ARDS, after contracting coronavirus. The average age of those who contracted the syndrome was 61.\nState lawmakers\nSo we know that people who are 60-years-old or older are likely to be more at-risk than other age groups. With this in mind, let\u2019s look at the age of North Carolina\u2019s legislators.\u00a0\nThe legislature includes 170 members: 120 in the House and 50 in the Senate.\nIn the Senate, 28 members are 60-years-old or older. In the House, 63 members are older than 60.\nThat means 91 members are aged 60 or older -- which is 53% of the General Assembly.\nThose numbers come from James White, the House principal clerk, and Sarah Holland, the Senate\u2019s principal clerk.\nSo it\u2019s true that a majority of legislators are 60 or older.\u00a0\nHow does that compare to Congress?\nIn the U.S. House, 197 of its 435 members are 60 or older. In the U.S. Senate, 66 of its 100 members are 60 or older. That means about 49% of Congress is at least 60 years-old.\nThose numbers come from a report by the Congressional Research Service and Jennifer Manning, the service\u2019s senior research librarian.\nOur ruling\nRep. Alexander said \"most\" North Carolina legislators are in the \"highest risk age group\" for coronavirus.\nThe highest risk age group is generally people who are aged 60 and older. Alexander\u2019s claim is on-point: more than half of legislators are older than that. We rate his claim True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18154"}
