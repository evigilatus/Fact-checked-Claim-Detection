He would also raise the standard deduction (the amount everyone can deduct from taxable income) but repeal personal exemptions and head of household filing status. \u00a0\nTax analysts have found that Trump\u2019s plan would deliver, on average, tax cuts across all income brackets. So how is it possible that single parents would pay more?\nThe Clinton campaign referred us to analysis of Trump\u2019s tax plan from\u00a0the Tax Policy Center, which is affiliated with the left-leaning Urban Institute.\nAccording to the report, authored by New York University professor Lily Batchelder, about 20 percent of households and more than half of single parents would wind up paying more in federal taxes.\nHow?\nFirst, Trump\u2019s proposal to increase the standard deduction wouldn\u2019t be enough to offset the amount many single parents could have deducted with personal exemptions (which Trump would take away).\nFor example, a single mother with one child can take a $9,350 standard deduction and two $4,050 exemptions, one for herself and one for her child in 2017 under the current system \u2014 or $17,450 in exemptions in total. Under Trump\u2019s plan, she would be able to take just a $15,000 standard deduction. The end result? That mother would have to pay income tax on an additional $2,450 under Trump\u2019s plan.\nSecond, the head of household filing status currently applies to unmarried filers with dependents, and their standard deduction and tax rates are between those of\u00a0married filers and single filers. Repealing this provision as Trump proposes would require single parents to file as individuals with higher tax rates. \u00a0\nThird, Trump\u2019s three brackets would increase taxes for many head of household filers. For example, the current lowest bracket is 10 percent, but Trump\u2019s lowest bracket is 12 percent.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For example, in 2017 a single parent with one child who claims the standard deduction would face a 25 percent tax rate on adjusted gross income between $53,050 and $68,550, compared with just a 15 percent rate under current law,\" Roberton Williams, an analyst at the Tax Policy Center, wrote in Forbes.\nPut it altogether, 51 percent of single parents or about 5.8 million households would see a tax increase under Trump\u2019s plan, Batchelder calculated. As our colleagues at FactCheck.org noted, \"single parents tend to do worse under Trump\u2019s plan than under current law.\"\nFor example, a single parent with an income of $75,000 and two school-age children would see his or her taxes increase by $2,440 or by $1,640 if the family had child care costs that could be deducted under Trump's plan, according to Batchelder. Similarly, a single parent making $50,000 and who had three children would face an increase of $1,188.\nThe Tax Foundation, a free market-oriented think tank, has not released similar analysis. But its director of federal projects, Kyle Pomerleau, found no faults with Batchelder\u2019s report.\n.@lilybatch We were able to replicate many of the numbers in the report.

But, analysts say, Trump\u2019s plan would make changes that would affect some people negatively.\nTrump\u2019s proposal to eliminate the head of household filing status and personal exemptions would raise federal income taxes for many single parents.\nWe rate Clinton\u2019s claim True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/45507710-0102-420f-8e0b-4b12522480ce", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03962"}
