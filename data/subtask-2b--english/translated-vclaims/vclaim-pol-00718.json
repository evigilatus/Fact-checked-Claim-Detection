He said that people who spent their time, no matter how serious their humiliation, deserved the right to vote. \"I believe that the right to vote is inherent in our democracy,\" said Sanders. \"Yeah, even for terrible people, because once you start cutting away and say that this person committed a terrible crime, not gonna let him vote, or that this person did it, The debate on whether released criminals should vote was at the last polling station in Florida. \"When they get out of prison, they must certainly have the right to vote,\" said Sanders this week. \"I believe that even if they are in prison, they pay for society, but this should not rob them of their inherent right to participate in our democracy.\" Sanders said that this example has been the case in Vermont since the founding of the State. He said, \"In the states of Vermont, from the early days of our state history, what our constitution says is that everyone can vote.\" \"That's right. So that the prisoners can vote.\" It is true that all prisoners of Vermont now enjoy the right to vote, but has that been true since the first day of the founding of the state? Saunders camp said that he could not respond immediately to questions concerning the candidate &apos; s claim. Vermont is only one of two states, and the other is Maine, where prisoners currently have the right to vote. In an article following Sanders &apos; remarks, the Berlinton Free Press described the voting system in the prison in Vermont. Even prisoners held outside the state in Mississippi are given the opportunity to vote at their last \"voluntary\" address at home. Dylan Lynch, a policy partner from the National Congress of State Legislatures, noted that four other states had enacted legislation this year that would allow people to vote while in prison for a felony. In Connecticut, the procedure failed, but in Louisiana, Massachusetts and New Jersey, the bills are still pending. It is also true that Vermont has allowed prisoners to vote since its founding. Minister for Foreign Affairs Jim Condus confirmed that prisoners in Vermont had no right to vote. In the 1990s, the Vermont Legislature tried to ban the voting of prisoners, but it was set aside in resolution 1799 of the Oversight Board, the \"Fourth Branch of Government, which is now isolated and meets every seven years to decide constitutional matters,\" according to the 2008 story of Associated Press. The Vermont Constitution of 1793 was interpreted to mean that the loss of voting rights can only occur in response to voter fraud. This case was cited as a previous one in the 1980s, in the most recent attempt to ban prisoners from voting in Vermont. The present Vermont Constitution provides that every person who is 18 years old and a citizen of the United States, \"residence in this State for the period established by the General Assembly and who acts calmly and peacefully... shall be entitled to all the privileges of the elector of this State.\" On January 10, 2021 in Facebook, it says that Nancy Belusi sent a letter to the mayor of Portland after demonstrations there \"inducing him to stick to a proven democratic playbook.\" By Sierra Aur\u00fcrk on January 11, 2021, Shawn Morales-Doyle, a lawyer at the Brennan Center for Justice, a non-partisan policy institute, said that certain language about voting is common in state constitutions, but that \"quiet and peaceful conduct\" is not one of them, which makes it difficult to know exactly what it means. However, he said that, unlike the language used in state constitutions, specific laws around prisoners &apos; votes often decided whether prisoners could vote. Morales-Doyle said that the timing of denying prisoners the right to vote in state laws was not random at all. Before the fifteenth amendment, which guaranteed men the right to vote regardless of race, Morales-Doyle said that very few states were concerned with denying prisoners their rights. However, after the adoption of the amendment, there was a wave of states that had enacted laws or amendments to withdraw prisoners &apos; right to vote. The fact that 48 states still did not allow prisoners to vote was undoubtedly a legacy of the laws of the Jim Crow era. However, following Florida &apos; s 2018 vote to grant freedom to criminals who had completed their sentences, Morales-Doyle said that there was growing interest in efforts to restore voting rights to people through the criminal justice system. In Vermont, however, even the existence of a full right of prisoners still leaves less room for voters than before. Peter Tichott, professor at Vermont Law School, said from 1777 to 1824, the state was \"very hungry for voters\" so that non-United States citizens had the right to vote in Vermont. (The capital of Vermont voted last year to allow non-citizens to vote again, a change in the Charter that is now being discussed in the state legislature.) The question that cannot be answered is whether Vermont prisoners have already used their constitutional rights throughout history. Condus said that the state does not track the number of prisoners in Vermont who vote. Instead, they appear on the voters' list in the same way as all other voters. Condus said that there was very little evidence to suggest that prisoners in Vermont institutions had historically been able to exercise that right. Condus said: \"This does not mean that this is not the case, but we still have to find any evidence of this.\" \"Voice is the foundation of our democracy, and we have worked hard to ensure that we break down barriers to eligible voters to register and vote.\" \"In the states of Vermont, from the early days of our state history, what our Constitution says is that everyone can vote. That's right. So that the prisoners can vote.\" It's true that Vermont criminals can vote from prison today, and we can't find anything that indicates that the situation wasn't always in the state. Although it seems very possible that today's efforts to allow them to vote have not always been made. The Vermont Constitution provides that people shall be \"quiet and peaceful conduct,\" but otherwise no restrictions shall be placed on those who can vote. And Sanders said prisoners can vote, not that they always vote. We're assessing this claim right.
