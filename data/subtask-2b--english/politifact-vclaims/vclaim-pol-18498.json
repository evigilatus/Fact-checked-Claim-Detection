None for Trump.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nIt seems to be based on a misunderstanding of how counting mail in ballots works.\nSome of the numbers are simply wrong, while others represent exaggerated versions of\u00a0 misinformation we have already debunked.\nLet\u2019s take it state by state.\n\nWisconsin\nWe previously debunked a Nov. 4 claim that said 112,000 ballots, all for Joe Biden, mysteriously surfaced in the middle of the night after Election Day in Wisconsin. Officials there said they didn\u2019t know what the number could have been referencing; at the time they were still counting\u00a0 absentee ballots overnight.\nThis new post changes it up a bit, claiming instead that \"140,000\" ballots were found for Biden between 3 and 4:30 a.m. in the state, presumably the night after Election Day polls closed Nov. 3 and into the morning of Nov. 4.\nThe figure is close to the number of mail in votes that were cast for Biden in Milwaukee County overall.\nThere was a jump in votes for Biden on the night of Nov. 3 because a large batch of absentee ballots from the City of Milwaukee finished processing around 3:30 a.m., election officials told us.\nElection officials worked through the night in Wisconsin to tally the unprecedented numbers of mail in ballots, which under state law they were not allowed to start counting until Election Day.\n\"A batch of about 170,000 absentee ballots is what came in from the City of Milwaukee. That\u2019s just the final tally, and when it arrived,\" said Brian Rothgery, public information manager at the Milwaukee County Board of Supervisors, referencing the time cited in the post.\u00a0\nBiden has won 69% of the vote in the county. For comparison, Hillary Clinton won about 65% of the vote in the county in 2016.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRELATED: Fact-checking the avalanche of Wisconsin election misinformation\u00a0\nMichigan\u00a0\nWe couldn\u2019t find evidence that 200,000 mail in ballots for Biden were found overnight, any night, in Michigan.\u00a0\nThe claim appears to be an exaggerated iteration of posts that falsely said Biden received a suspicious influx of 138,339 votes in Michigan overnight following Election Day, while other candidates received none.\u00a0\nThat claim relied on a data error that appeared on the elections map powered by Decision Desk HQ, an election data and analysis service.\u00a0\nThe error came from the central Michigan county of Shiawassee. Caroline Wilson, the county\u2019s clerk, told fact-checking organization AFP that she added an extra zero accidentally, reporting 153,710 votes for Biden instead of 15,371.\nThe difference, 138,339, was removed from Biden\u2019s total within about 20 minutes, election officials said.\nPennsylvania\u00a0\nWe have seen no credible reports that Pennsylvania election workers discovered 1 million mail in ballots for Biden \"between 2 and 4 a.m.,\" or at any other time.\nThe claim may have originated from this Gateway Pundit story, which says that, \"Democrats, in the privacy of the Philly Convention Center, without ANY GOP inspectors, added OVER ONE MILLION VOTES to Joe Biden\u2019s totals in 2 days!\"\nThat\u2019s not the case. A judge ruled to let election observers watch the count in Philadelphia from closer up, but representatives from both parties have been allowed to observe the process all along. The counting is also being streamed live online.\nElection officials in the state told PolitiFact there is \"no truth to the claim\" that any votes were mysteriously \"found\" for Biden there.\nIn Pennsylvania, both Trump and Biden gained around 1 million votes on the night of Nov. 3 and into the morning of Nov. 4, according to the FiveThirtyEight election graph, which showed that the biggest increase happened between midnight and 3 a.m.\nOur ruling\nFacebook posts are spreading a tweet that claims election workers, overnight, \"found\" 140,000 mail in ballots in Wisconsin, 200,000 in Michigan and 1 million in Pennsylvania, and all were for Biden.\nThis is inaccurate. The numbers are either wrong or exaggerated, and the post misinterprets the counting and reporting of legal mail in ballots as \"found\" votes.\nWe rate this False.\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections FactChat #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click here, for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18498"}
