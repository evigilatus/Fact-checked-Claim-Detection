The\n\nNew York Times\n\n, for example,\u00a0\n\nreported\n\nthat Obama would sign the bill, earmarks and all, \"despite campaign promises to put an end to the practice.\"\n\n\nThat's incorrect. Obama did not promise to end earmarking, only to \"reform\" it, and eliminate \"screwy\" or wasteful earmarks.\n\n\nBoehner, however, was more careful than the\n\nNew York Times.\n\nHis claim that Obama \"campaigned against this type of legislation\" could be read a number of ways.\n\n\nBoehner's spokesman, Michael Steel, said Boehner meant that Obama had broken his campaign pledges, referenced on the\n\nWhite House Web site\n\n, to \"slash earmarks to no greater than 1994 levels and ensure all spending decisions are open to the public.\" That's a reasonable interpretation of what Boehner said.\n\n\nObama did indeed make those pledges during the campaign. Sen. John McCain, the Republican candidate, pledged to eliminate earmarks and \"veto every earmark pork-barrel bill,\" and Obama, though stopping short of that, did pledge to get tough on them.\n\n\nFor example, here's Obama in the first\n\npresidential debate\n\n: \"Absolutely, we need earmark reform. And when I'm president, I will go line by line to make sure that we are not spending money unwisely.\"\n\n\nOn March 10, 2008, Obama said in a\n\nstatement\n\n: \"We can no longer accept a process that doles out earmarks based on a member of Congress' seniority, rather than the merit of the project. We can no longer accept an earmarks process that has become so complicated to navigate that a municipality or nonprofit group has to hire high-priced D.C. lobbyists to do it. And we can no longer accept an earmarks process in which many of the projects being funded fail to address the real needs of our country.\"\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd here he is\u00a0on\n\nFeb. 21, 2008\n\n: \"I have been consistently in favor of more disclosure around earmarks. Now, keep in mind a lot of these are worthy projects in our states, and I have actively pursued projects that I think are important. But I want to make sure that they're not done in the dark of night, that they're not done in committee, that everybody stands up and says this is the kind of spending that I think is important.\"\n\n\nThe closest he came to saying he would eliminate earmarks, as far as we could find, was when he said, in the\n\nthird presidential debate\n\n, \"Earmarks account for 0.5 percent of the total federal budget. There's no doubt that the system needs reform and there are a lot of screwy things that we end up spending money on, and they need to be eliminated. But it's not going to solve the problem.\" (Given his other campaign statements on earmarks, it's clear he meant \"screwy,\" or wasteful, earmarks should be eliminated, not all earmarks.)\n\n\nSo the question is, is the omnibus spending bill the \"type of legislation\" that Obama campaigned against with respect to earmarks? That is, did it lack transparency, include earmarks based on a congressman's seniority and ones that are wasteful? And was the amount more than the 1994 level of $7.8 billion a year?\n\n\nThe answer to most of those questions is largely yes, said Keith Ashdown, investigator for Taxpayers for Common Sense, a Washington watchdog group. Ashdown said the earmarking process for the omnibus bill was not any more transparent than it was when Obama was campaigning. He said seven of the top 10 earmark recipients in the Senate are on the Appropriations Committee, suggesting that access was more important than merit when it came to deciding what projects would get earmarks.\n\n\nAnd though the total cost of the earmarks in the bill, $7.7 billion, is slightly less than the 1994 level, there were another $6.6 billion in earmarks in three previous spending bills for this year that Congress passed last year.\n\n\nAre there wasteful projects in the bill? Ashdown said he hasn't had time to research that. \"There likely is, but I just don't know,\" he said. He cautioned against leaping to conclusions about projects that \"sound goofy.\" For example, some critics have mocked a $1 million earmark to control Mormon crickets in Utah \u2014 but Ashdown said the Mormon cricket, a type of katydid,\u00a0is a very serious threat to agriculture.\n\n\nThe White House has argued that Obama should not be held responsible for the earmarking process in this legislative package \u2014 which is nine of the 12 spending bills for the current budget year rolled into one \u2014 because it is \"last year's business.\"\n\n\nAnd there's some truth to that. These are bills that Congress was supposed to pass last year.\n\n\nBut that doesn't nullify Boehner's point that the bill is \u2014 in featuring earmarks added by senior members of Congress in a process that lacked transparency and\u00a0pushed earmark spending for the year well over $7.8 billion \u2014 the \"type of legislation\" Obama campaigned against.
