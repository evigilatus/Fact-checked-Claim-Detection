Scott Walker in early 2011, Democrat Mahlon Mitchell lost his electoral debut in the state\u2019s historic recall elections on June 5, 2012.\n\nBut three days later, Mitchell -- defeated 53 percent to 47 percent by GOP Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch -- was hailed as a rising star at the state Democratic Party\u2019s annual convention.\n\nSo it wasn\u2019t surprising that Mitchell was among those chosen to criticize Republican Mitt Romney ahead of the presumptive presidential nominee\u2019s June 18, 2012 visit to Wisconsin.\n\nMitchell\u2019s line of attack: As Massachusetts governor, Romney cut millions for firefighters\u2019 equipment. It carried extra weight because Mitchell is head of the Wisconsin firefighter union.\n\nOn June 12, 2012, Romney claimed that President Barack Obama wants to add more government jobs and said the nation doesn\u2019t \"need more firemen, more policemen, more teachers.\"\n\nThe same day, the Wisconsin Democratic Party issued a news release in response, quoting Mitchell and a national Democratic Party spokesman.\n\nMitchell claimed in the release that Romney used a line-item veto to cut \"millions of dollars for firefighting equipment,\" including firefighters' \"coats, pants, helmets and boots.\"\n\nHis claim was similar to one made a day earlier by an Obama campaign official and another made days later by Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nIs Mitchell right?\n\nMitchell\u2019s evidence\n\nAsked for evidence, Mitchell referred us to Gillian Morris, spokeswoman for Obama's re-election campaign in Wisconsin.\n\nShe cited a July 2006 veto Romney issued for line item 8000-0050 in Massachusetts\u2019 2007 budget, his last during his single four-year term as governor.\n\nThe item, which was restored \u00a0by the legislature, provided for $2.5 million in grants to local fire departments for firefighting equipment that would \"include, but is not limited to, turnout gear.\"\n\nTurnout gear, said Edward Kelly, Mitchell\u2019s counterpart with the Massachusetts firefighters union, generally includes a firefighter\u2019s coat and pants.\n\nThat\u2019s also how turnout gear is described by the National Fire Protection Association.\n\nBut Kelly said turnout gear could also be interpreted to include a helmet and boots. And in any case, the line item allowed local governments to spend the grant money on any type of fire safety equipment.\n\nOther views\n\nFor context, we wondered whether Romney\u2019s veto was indicative of his treatment of fire departments and firefighters when he was governor.\n\nKelly said Romney cut aid to local governments, which resulted in cuts in fire department funding and led to firefighter layoffs.\n\nA February 2012 Boston Globe article also mentioned the aid cuts in recounting how, as governor, \"Romney fiercely protected a costly and controversial perk for police officers after seeking and receiving the endorsement of the politically influential police unions.\"\n\nWe also contacted Jim Stergios, executive director of the Pioneer Institute, a Boston think tank that values \"free market principles, individual liberty and responsibility, and the ideal of effective, limited and accountable government.\" He said the Romney administration generally \"limited grant programs to municipalities because their view was that such programs represented a relatively unaccountable entry into local affairs.\"\n\n\"There was also a political principle at work,\" Stergios said in an email. \"Resist the usual small, targeted grants to local constituencies because they opened up all kinds of political fights among those constituencies (the firefighters got a grant, so shouldn't the police officers?) and localities (Bourne, Lawrence, and Worcester all wanted grants for fire stations, why shouldn't other communities?).\"\n\nWe asked Romney\u2019s campaign for a response to Mitchell\u2019s claim. Spokeswoman Allie Brandenburger provided a video clip of comments Romney gave in response to an interview question about his statement that the nation didn\u2019t need more firefighters.\n\nThat had nothing to do with Mitchell\u2019s claim, so we emailed Brandenburger again, but got no reply.\n\nOur rating\n\nMitchell said that as Massachusetts governor, Romney used a line-item veto to cut \"millions of dollars for firefighting equipment,\" including firefighters' \"coats, pants, helmets and boots.\"\n\nIn 2006, Romney vetoed $2.5 million in grants for all types of fire safety equipment, including those Mitchell cited.\n\nWe rate Mitchell\u2019s statement True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10836"}
