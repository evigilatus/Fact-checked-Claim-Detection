However, the authorship of the initial letter outlining one accusation was not in dispute.\nChristine Blasey Ford wrote a confidential letter to her congresswoman\u00a0over the summer saying she was sexually assaulted by Kavanaugh while the two were in high school. The committee\u2019s top Republican Sen. Charles Grassley released that letter publicly on Sept. 23. Ranking committee member Sen. Dianne Feinstein sent him the letter Sept. 20.\nSome websites have questioned the letter\u2019s legitimacy, saying Ford did not author the letter.\nFord has now testified under oath that she did.\nThe blog Natural News makes the claim, saying the letter contains \"14 glaring errors that could only be committed by a poorly educated writer.\"\nThis story was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

The blogger points out phrases like \"the two scrapped with each other\" and \"I feared he may inadvertently kill me\" as examples of poor or odd phrasing.\nOther \"errors\" could be due to copying procedures. An \"I\" toward the end of the document has a blur that makes it look lowercase. A line of text is stretched larger than other lines in the scan. The blogger points to the warp as an attempt to alter the content of the letter because that line has Kavanaugh\u2019s name in it. Kavanaugh is named several other places in the letter without any text warping.\nAnother of the \"errors\" is that Ford uses the phrase \"opportune moment.\" The blogger says that wording \"indicates a low-level writer attempting to sound sophisticated.\" That\u2019s an unfounded opinion, not an error.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Natural News has made ridiculous claims related to Ford\u2019s credibility or motives. We gave the blog a Pants on Fire rating for a claim that Ford came forward to \"protect abortion industry profits.\"\nThis isn\u2019t any less absurd.
