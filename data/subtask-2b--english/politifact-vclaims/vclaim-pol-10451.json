David Cicilline says the United States will spend $100 billion in Afghanistan this year, on roads, bridges, training police officers and more", "text": "During last week\u2019s televised clash between U.S. Rep. David Cicilline and Anthony Gemma, who is challenging Cicilline in the 1st Congressional District Democratic primary, the topic turned to possible ways of cutting the federal deficit.\n\nCicilline, in the WPRI-TV/Providence Journal debate, \u00a0urged a swift return of U.S. troops from Afghanistan as one suggestion, noting that \u00a0\"We will spend $100 billion in Afghanistan this year, fixing roads, building bridges, training police officers, and more [and] cutting the same things in our own country.\"\n\nHis message was clear: it is time for the United States to start redirecting that money toward improving America\u2019s own crumbling infrastructure -- a theme Cicilline has been sounding for months.\n\nBut we wondered if the United States was really spending $100 billion a year for Afghan infrastructure and other non-military aid. We called Cicilline campaign for its supporting evidence and while we waited for a response, did some research.\n\nPolitiFact National examined the subject of non-military aid to Afghanistan in May 2012 when it looked at whether President Obama had kept a campaign promise to increase that aid by another $1 billion to $3 billion. (PolitiFact rated it Promise Kept.)\n\nOne source of information PolitiFact National cited was a May 2012 Congressional Research Service report,which found that during fiscal years 2001 through 2011-- a span of a decade -- \"the Afghan intervention has cost about $443 billion, including all costs.\"\n\nFor fiscal year 2012, which ends Sept. 30, the report says, the United States was expected to spend \"about $90 billion\" for military operations and another \"$16 billion in aid,\" including training and equipment.\n\nThat\u2019s far different from $100 billion going to just to infrastructure and non-military projects in one year, as Cicilline seemed to be implying.\n\nAccording to a July quarterly report of the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, which keeps a running tab of the war\u2019s costs for Congress, \"the President\u2019s FY 2013 budget request includes nearly $9.7 billion to strengthen the Afghan security forces during this critical transition period and to fund programs to build governing capacity, promote economic development, and counter the drug trade.\"\n\nThe special inspector general\u2019s report also includes a graphicwhich shows that between 2002 and March of 2012, \"the United States had appropriated approximately $89.48 billion for relief and reconstruction in Afghanistan.\" \u00a0\n\nThe money had been allocated into five major areas:\n\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

But we are spending about $15 billion this year for that kind of non-military aid, not $100 billion.\n\nTherefore we rate his statement: False", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10451"}
