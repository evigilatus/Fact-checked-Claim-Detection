In response to a question from Klein about the conservative era initiated by President Ronald Reagan, Butigig said that the government approach at the time \"was very relevant to deregulation, weakening labour standards and reducing taxes at all levels, based on this assumption that this would develop the economy. On one level he did. The growth figures at the top line were very large. On the other hand, if my figures are correct, since 1973, the bottom 90% income, almost every one of us, has not budged, or even declined slightly.\" Is it true that for most people, income levels have not risen since 1973 - having adapted to inflation, which economists consider necessary for such comparisons? The data show that income levels have already risen to post-inflation during that period, but the share of the income taken by the lower 90 per cent is very closely hit by what Butigig said. (The Buttergue campaign did not respond to queries.) Neither we nor the economists were able to find an accurate set of data suitable for the Potigig formula, but we found a nearby set. It was calculated by the Budget Office of Congress, the non-partisan arm of Congress, covering the period from 1979 to 2015, and most of the period concerned. The figures used by civil society organizations are adjusted to take account of inflation and federal taxes, but not for state and domestic taxes. It shows income growth for people in four different economic ranges: the lowest 20 per cent of income distribution, the average 60 per cent, 81 per cent to 99 per cent and the largest 1 per cent. These standards do not reflect the precise parameters set by Buttig, but economists have told us that they are useful in showing whether or not he is generally right. Here's a graph that summarizes what Botig found: the first 1 percent in red has the most unique and impressive growth. Other income groups are closely grouped. But look closely at the slope of the line: it's going up. The rise is not as fast anywhere as it was for the highest 1 per cent, but has increased after adjusting for inflation. This weakens Butigig's assertion that income for most people has \"not budged, or even declined slightly,\" since the 1970s. Gary Portless, an economist working with the Brookings Institution, added that subsequent data since 2015 were likely to show additional increases, as income throughout income distribution had improved since 2015. (He also said that the addition of data for the period 1973 to 1978 was unlikely to make a difference.) Bertellis said: \"It's very unlikely to be true.\" There are other measures that say that other data support Botig's claim more closely. Let us look at wages, which are what you earn from your work; they do not include other types of income, including benefits and payments from programmes such as social security or food stamps. On January 13, 2021, the distinguished fact-checkers in a story written by General David Berger, the commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request to use the Marines to provide security for the inauguration, and told her that we were \"not working for you.\" The following chart, taken from data collected by the Centre's Left Economic Policy Institute, shows inflation-adjusted data on wages dating back to 1973. We've broken down wage levels by 10% -- 10% lower, 10% next, and so on. The graph shows a clear stagnation in wages for the lowest 60 per cent of the income scale. The rate has already risen in relation to levels 70 and 80 per cent, which means that 90 per cent of Butgeg will be somewhat exaggerated. (It should also be noted that wage data exclude income from social security, medical care, medical aid, food stamps and refundable tax exemptions such as tax relief on earned income, and are therefore an incomplete picture of household income. And what if you look at the percentage of total income that each group receives, instead of just \"income\"? This is a useful way of looking at this trend because if income is generally rising, people can see an increase in income even as their percentage of pie remains the same or decreases. This measurement follows closely the pattern mentioned in the Butigig case. The World Inequality Database is based on the work of economists Thomas Beckett and Emmanuel Sayes, who specialize in income inequality. Its approach is not universally accepted - they use pre-tax income and include capital gains, which are likely to increase income to the richest people - but economists say that their approach is not unreasonable. This graph shows the share of income taken by four different parts of the income distribution: this shows that each of the bottom 50% and the next 40% - mainly the 90% cited by Butageg - has taken declining shares of the State's income since 1973. In contrast, both the highest 10 per cent and the largest 1 per cent saw their quota growth. The similarities between the Butigig Statement and the World Inequality Database figures are strong, as Brendan Duke said, the tax policy analyst at the Liberal Centre for Budget and Policy Priorities. \"Many analysts say that community organization data is a more complete concept of \"income\" as it is repeatedly defined in the economy, but one can also argue that Says-Becketti's data are closer to the way most Americans think about income,\" said Duke. \"If you ask most Americans about their income, they will probably not count the premiums paid by their employer for their health insurance or the value of the medical care they receive, \"Since 1973, he entered down 90 percent, almost every one of us, didn't budge, or even retreat a little.\" In fact, the income per group, calculated by community-based organizations, has increased beyond the inflation rate since the 1970s. However, another measure - the share of income taken by the lowest 90 per cent - has already declined since 1973. We evaluate the statement half right.
