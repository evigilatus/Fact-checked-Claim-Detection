Hillary Clinton about her health care plan.\n\n\n\u201cOh, no, I\u2019m not,\u201d said Clinton, who appeared on the\n\nThe O\u2019Reilly Factor\n\non April 30, 2008.\n\n\nClinton boiled her plan down to this: \u201cEverybody who has health insurance who\u2019s happy with it, you keep it. No changes. But what I am going to do is take an already existing plan -- it\u2019s not government-run, it\u2019s not a new bureaucracy. It\u2019s the way Congress and federal employees get their health care. And we\u2019re going to open it up to every American, because I think it\u2019s about time...\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut you\u2019re going to subsidize it,\u201d O\u2019Reilly interjected.\n\n\n\u201cWell, we are,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cBut here\u2019s why. You already are subsidizing it. Your family policy has a $900 hidden tax. Why? Because when some poor person who doesn\u2019t have health insurance...\u201d\n\n\n\u201c...goes to the emergency room...you\u2019ve got to pick it up,\u201d O\u2019Reilly said, finishing her sentence.\n\n\nThe $900 figure is key to Clinton\u2019s plan. Yes, she is saying, the government will subsidize her health care plan. But, the thinking goes, private insurance companies will charge lower premiums to their existing customers because they will no longer have to subsidize health care costs incurred by uninsured people.\n\n\nThink of it like this, said John Sheils, senior vice president of The Lewin Group, a non-partisan group that has analyzed health care plans for both Democrats and Republicans: Someone shoplifts a loaf of bread from the grocery story. The price of bread is inflated a bit for everyone else to offset the store\u2019s loss.\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s kind of what\u2019s going on with healthcare,\u201d Sheils said.\n\n\nHospitals have to treat people who come in and need medical care. And if those people don\u2019t pay, \u201cit\u2019s kind of like walking out of the story without paying for bread,\u201d he said.\n\n\nThe cost is shifted onto those with private insurance.\n\n\nSheils said Clinton\u2019s claim that family health insurance policies subsidize the uninsured to the tune of about $900 a year is \u201cin the ballpark.\u201d Sheils believes the number is a little lower, closer to $800 per year.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 20, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Biden had to take a private plane to D.C. instead of a government plane \u201cbecause they know he\u2019s not a legitimate president\u201d and \"the military is now responsible for restoring legitimate civilian government.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 21, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHillary cites that same $900 figure in her formal health care proposal, the American Health Choices Plan.\n\n\n\u201cOne cause of the crisis in the health care system is that rather than containing costs, the system shifts them: about half of all hospital losses are passed along to other payers,\u201d according to her plan. \u201cRather than reducing prices, the system raises families\u2019 costs.\n\n\n\u201cAnd, rather than covering all Americans, the system charges insured families a \u201chidden tax\u201d: premiums are roughly $900 higher to pay for the cost of care for the uninsured.\u201d\n\n\nIt cites a report from Families USA called \u201cPaying a Premium: The added cost of care for the uninsured.\u201d The report was based on an analysis of data by Kenneth E. Thorpe, former Clinton administration health expert, now a professor at Emory University.\n\n\nThorpe says Clinton\u2019s figure actually is low.\n\n\nAccording to his analysis, about $922 of a family policy was used to subsidize the uninsured in 2005. But the cost of health care has gone up since then, as have the number of uninsured. In 2008, the number is closer to $1,270, he said.\n\n\n\u201cThe only way for hospitals to offset the costs (of the uninsured) is to have private insurers pay more than it\u2019s worth,\u201d Thorpe said. \u201cIt is their only means to stay financially solvent.\u201d\n\n\nIn 2005, private health paid about 25% more than the cost of care in hospitals, Thorpe said, citing a Medicare Payment Advisory Commission report to Congress.\n\n\nO\u2019Reilly didn\u2019t contest Clinton\u2019s numbers, but he did take umbrage with subsidizing other people\u2019s health care.\n\n\n\u201cI mean, I don\u2019t want to be paying for someone who\u2019s taking heroin and drinking a bottle of gin a day,\u201d O\u2019Reilly said.\n\n\n\u201cBut I assume you want to pay for some hardworking families whose kid has juvenile diabetes,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cOr some woman... that just gets diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis.\"\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind doing it,\u201d O\u2019Reilly said.\n\n\nClinton\u2019s point was that, to an extent, family health policy holders already are shouldering some of the burden for the uninsured. There may be some debate about whether the number is exactly $900 a year, as she stated, but several health policy experts agreed that she\u2019s at least close.
