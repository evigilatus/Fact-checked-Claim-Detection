We have assessed half of the truth as a relevant claim by the State Sen. Alberta Darling, a Republican suburb of Milwaukee, that the State has not only a deficit, but a surplus of $443 million. At present, the State budget for 2011 - 15 has this surplus, but by the end of the fiscal year, in June 2015, the Office expects to convert into a deficit of $396 million. Here's what we know from this: the verification of previous facts regarding the estimate of the deficit of $1.8 billion provided by the non-partisan financial office for the period 2015-17:1. The projected deficit of $1.8 billion represents a deliberate speculation on future tax collection and demand for services. In large part, deficiencies are due to changes in the amount of funds generated through income and sales taxes, which depend on the economy, among other factors. 2. Human rights and fundamental freedoms. 12 - 17 5 Again, the projection relates not to the current budget cycle, but to the biennium 2015-17. A budget for 2015-17 is allocated to the winner of the presidential election held on 4 November 2014 between the Government. Democratic Scott Walker and Mary Burke to propose and adopt the new legislature during the first half of 2015. The projected $1.8 billion assumes no changes in revenue and no changes in expenditure - in other words, the continuation of state government operations as it is now. The figure may be smaller or larger, depending on the different tax collection and expenditure. Moreover, there is no way to know how State officials will deal with any shortage. It is up to the next Governor and Legislature to decide whether tax increases or spending cuts are necessary. When Walker took office in January 2011, he faced a deficit of $2.5 billion, in addition to an increase of approximately $1.1 billion in requests for funding from government agencies. This amounted to $3.6 billion in \"deficit,\" which Walker addressed through funding cuts and the Collective Bargaining Act 10. Subsequently, tax cuts contributed to the projected deficit for 2015-17, sometimes referred to as the \"structural deficit\" of the State. Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" \u2022 January 26, 2012, we asked Larson staff to provide evidence that the estimated shortfall would cost individuals $300 and families valued at $1,200 over the next two years. A UNODC spokesperson simply said the projected deficit section - $1.766 billion - by the people of Wisconsin - 5,742,712 people, according to the 2013 United States census. The result was $307 per person. This was multiplied by four, the figure was $1,230. However, the division of the expected deficit into the individual level does not in any way mean that individuals or families will have to pay these amounts. In fact, the spokesman for Larson Fred Ludwig told us that Larson was referring to \"cost\" in a broad sense -- that the shortfall of $1.8 billion means that people will see either tax increases or service cuts. However, as we have noted, the estimate of $1.8 billion can change, and there is no way of knowing how State officials will respond to this shortfall. If a similar allegation had been made by Larson at the same stage four years ago, it would also have been wrong. One measure of how the deficit can be addressed is: Walker has addressed the deficit in his first budget with significant cuts in spending and other changes, some of which have provided taxpayers with funds. Our assessment says Larson: \"For the next two years, this deficit of $1.8 billion will cost each Wisconsin 300 dollars, or $1,200 for families of four.\" No decisions will be taken until long after the November 2014 elections on whether revenue should be increased or spending reduced to close the $1.8 billion gap, an estimate for the 2015-17 State budget cycle. The figure of $1.8 billion can change, based on tax collection. We appreciate that Larson's statement is wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07325"}
