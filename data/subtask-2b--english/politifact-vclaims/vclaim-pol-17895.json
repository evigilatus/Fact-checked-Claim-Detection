He called on Congress to \"outlaw chokeholds, stop the transfer of weapons of war to local police forces, improve oversight and accountability, and create a model use-of-force standard.\"\n\"We need to implement real community policing and ensure that every police department in the country undertakes a comprehensive review of their hiring, their training, and their de-escalation practices,\" Biden wrote.\nOur ruling\nTrump said Biden wants to \"defund the police.\"\nBiden did not have this position when Trump made this claim, and his campaign\u2019s website does not list defunding the police as part of \"Joe\u2019s vision.\" Biden and his campaign have since said Biden does not support defunding police but does support reform.\nWe rate Trump's statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17895"}
