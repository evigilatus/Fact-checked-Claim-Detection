Cain says the nation is behind the United States in the CT cameras.", "text": "In the United States, health care is expensive for patients. However, it may be more expensive for elected officials next year. Both Republicans and Democrats hope to raise public concerns about health care as a powerful weapon in the upcoming presidential and congressional elections, and some of the first candidates have already begun to swing. In January and last month, the Executive Director of former Rabbi Pizza and Governor Herman Cain attacked a presidential reconnaissance committee in President Barack Obama &apos; s healthcare initiative. The health-care plan approved by the Democrats in the House of Representatives and the Senate was described as a social medicine that increased waiting times for diagnostic examinations. Cain, a cancer survivor, said waiting longer could put cancer patients like him at risk by delaying discovery. Cain told The Rut, a black online magazine: \"In Canada, the number of CT cameras per 1,000 people is like the tenth we have here in this country. That's why people must wait.\" And that's a big difference, so we decided to move this statement through our diagnostic equipment to see if it's accurate evidence prediction. Computerized imaging scanners are X-ray machines that release several rays from different angles simultaneously to produce detailed images of any part of the body. CT scanners are used to search for bleeding in the body, tumors and other internal damage. Unfortunately, Cain didn't tell us how he identified the number of CT scanners in Canada and the United States. In fact, neither he nor any of his crew will tell us anything else, \"I don't think we're gonna hang.\" However, Polyte Fact found data that determined the number of CTs per capita. Canada had 12.7 scanners per million inhabitants in 2007, according to OECD. The United States had 34.3 per million in 2007, last year, data on the United States. Canada has fewer scanners per individual from Greece and Portugal, countries about to fail, and certainly fewer than the United States, but not \"like a tenth.\" It's more like a third. Although the number of Caines was not factually accurate, his general view that the lack of diagnostic capacity puts patients at risk is still worthy of scrutiny. Canada was spending less on medical treatment, and therefore, as Edwin Meyer said, its capacity was lower than that of the founder of the Buffalo-based Cross-Border Access Company, a company that helped negotiate hospital bills for Canadians coming to the United States for medical services. Canada is doing a good job of giving priority to those who need to be served immediately. By doing so, the costs for patients are kept low, as Meyer said. However, a person suffering a life-threatening injury that prevents him from working and causes permanent pain may not immediately receive diagnostic and surgical services. \"People who need but are stable can end up waiting for a long time,\" said Meyer. While the United States has generally better capacity, many Americans, like the uninsured, do not have access to it, as William Custer, a professor at the Institute of Health Management at the State University of Georgia, said. The large number of CT scanners also helped raise the cost of health care in the United States, but Custer said that there was insufficient evidence that this more expensive service would lead to better health outcomes. In the end, you cannot judge the national health-care system for medical capacity alone. \"They trade as we trade,\" said Custer. \"It's a matter of taste.\" If Cain had said that Canada had one third of the number of CT scanners in the United States, he would have been right, and then we could have examined whether this lack of capacity made the Canadian system sub-standard. This is not what he said, although he does not need a 3D X-ray machine to know that the tenth is different from the third. * Diagnosis: error.
