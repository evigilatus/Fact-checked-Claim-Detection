On October 16, in the MSNBC newspaper \"Morning Joe,\" the participant Joe Scarboro opened an interview with former Congressman in Texas, saying: \"Tell us about your plan on the confiscation of arms, which many clearly believe is unconstitutional, and they are also very concerned that it plays directly in the hands of Republican candidates. \"To be clear, I'm not talking about confiscating anyone's weapons. But I believe that for these weapons of war - AR-15s, AK-47s - these weapons were designed and sold to the world's military to kill people on the battlefield and there are more than 16 million of them in America. We have seen the devastating impact they can have in Dayton, Ohio, El Paso, Texas or Odessa, not too far from where I live. They must be bought or each of them is a potential instrument of terrorism in this country.\" In fact, the answer of Aurourke is not clear at all. We'll help you arrange gymnastics. The targeted weapons were used in both El Paso and Dayton collective shootings, which are offensive weapons and are legitimate in both states. Each weapon was semi-automatic - the gunmen could have fired as quickly as possible - and carried enough ammunition to kill dozens of people in minutes. The El Paso shooter used a semi-automatic Kalashnikov rifle (also known as an AK-47 rifle), usually using a magazine containing 30 shots. The shooter in Dayton used an AR-15 pistol, modified to operate as a rifle, with a drum magazine that could carry up to 100 rounds. In his previous speech, O &apos; Rourke was asked at least twice whether he would support the confiscation of the weapons he called weapons of war. He said yes. 12 September Democratic presidential debate co-hosted by David Muir: \"Some at this stage have proposed the voluntary repurchase of weapons in this country. I've gone beyond that. I said, quote, \"The Americans who own AR-15s and AK-47s will have to sell them to the government, all of them.\" You know the critics call this confiscation. Are you proposing to take their weapons? How's that gonna work?\" Orok: \"I am, if it's a weapon designed to kill people on the battlefield. When we see it being used against children, in Odessa, I met the mother of a 15-year-old girl who was shot by AR-15, and that mother watched her bleeding to death 24 hours a day because many other people were shot by AR-15 in Odessa and Midland (Texas), there weren't enough ambulances to get to them in time, hell, yeah, we're going to take your AR-15, AK-47.\" On September 18, CNN \"Cuomo's head of host time Chris Kuomo: \"Well, let's put the proposal forward. Are you, in fact, in favour of the confiscation of weapons? Orok: \"Yes, when it comes to AR-15s and AK-47s, weapons designed for military combat. So, when it comes to those weapons, Chris, the answer is yes. But when it comes to hunting or self-defence firearms, the answer is no.\" How else did Aurourke describe his proposal on the same day as the interview \"Am Joe,\" the host of \"New Day\" on CNN: \"How do you plan to get offensive weapons away from people who don't want to give them up?\" The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" By Samantha Buterman - January 11, 2012, O'Rourke replied: \"It's very simple. As with any law in this country, we expect our American colleagues to follow the law.\" Later, Kameruta pushed back by saying that collective shooters would not follow such a law. She then said about O'Rourke's proposal: \"Looks like confiscation.\" O'Rourke replied: \"No, I'm not suggesting that. And I think that's why people use the word \"confiscated,\" because it scares people. What I'm talking about is a mandatory buyback, where Americans who own AR-15 or AK-47 will sell this weapon back to the government. O'Rourke made similar comments on \"Good morning, Joe.\" Scarborough asked what the federal government would do if owners of AR-15s and AK-47s refused to sell. Aurourke said: \"As in any law that does not follow or is grossly abused, there must be consequences or there will be no respect for the law. So, in that case, I think there's gonna be a law enforcement visit to get that firearm back and make sure it's bought, and then bought it again, so it can't be used against someone else.\" We added some additional contexts to the Orroc statement after we first published this fact-checking process. When asked later in the interview about going door-to-door to pick up conventional guns, Aurourke said she was not as lethal as the weapons used in the assault, and there was the use of a gun project for protection at home. The O'Rourke website states that it calls for \"a mandatory programme for the repurchase of offensive weapons and a voluntary programme for the repurchase of hand-guns,\" and that \"individuals who do not participate in the mandatory purchase of offensive weapons will be fined.\" \"Beto was clearly talking about a mandatory program to buy back offensive weapons, which are not confiscation\" his campaign told us. Aurourke's argument that his plan is not ultimately confiscation is based on the fact that the Government will buy arms from its owner. But this is misleading. Arms owners will have no say in this matter, and because they will be compensated, it is likely that some will not see trade in equal value. The owners are required to sell, and if they do not, then what happens next will be ambiguous. O'Rourke says that people may be fined, and that they may somehow have to hand over their weapons through the buy-back program. While manipulating scenarios how this can happen, they all lead to something that most people consider to be confiscated. It is clear that many of the owners of arms who have purchased and possessed weapons are deemed to be confiscated by the Government, even if they have been paid for the weapons. \"It is unreasonable to call it what Mr. O'Rourke proposes anything other than confiscation,\" said arms law expert George Moxeri, a professor of law at Wyoming University, Politi Fact. Imagine the situation when the owner of a weapon refuses to sell. He is fined. Anyway, the owner still has the gun. Does the payment of the fine mean that the weapon can now be retained and is fully legal? Of course not, \"Moxari said. \"There is no scenario in which a single owner of a particular weapon obtains to retain it. This is confiscation.\" \"To be clear, I'm not talking about confiscating anyone's weapons.\" Orok said \"yes\" and \"yes, yes\" when asked about the confiscation of assault-type weapons. And his mandatory purchase suggests taking those weapons from people even if it involves buying. We consider O'Rourke's claim that \"no one's arms are confiscated\" to be false.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00040"}
