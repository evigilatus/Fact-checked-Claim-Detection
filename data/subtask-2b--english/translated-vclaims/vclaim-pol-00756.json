The stadium is still empty today and is scheduled to host only three events during the remainder of the year. Denny Hoskins of the Warnsburg is sponsoring an SB44 bill proposing the legalization of sports gambling in Missouri. The bill proposes to take 0.5% of all bets for integrity fees and place those revenues in a fund to pay for tax-funded improvements to sports stadiums, including the dome at the American Center. In an article published by Colombia, Dili Tribune, in January 31, Hoskins spoke about the proposed bill and debt payments on the dome at the American Center. \"Missouri still owes $60 million on bonds issued to build Edward Jones, a 23-year-old dome, the former home of St. Louis Rams,\" noted Hoskins. Do the people of Missouri still owe $60 million on an abandoned stadium? We've reached out to Hoskins to see where his numbers came from. His Chief of Staff, Rachel Bauer, explained that the senator was \"a little high\" in his assessment and referred to the state budget for the right numbers. In 1991, prior to the start of construction on the stadium, the Regional Conference and Sports Complex issued $132,910,000 of the draft convention bonds and the sports facility to pay for the project. Debt has been refinanced several times, most recently in 2013, when the principal of the remaining debt was $64.385 million. This is probably where Sen got the $60 million. Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" \u2022 26 January 2021, however, after examining the 2018 State Debt Report, the principal of the remaining debt was $35.45 million last July. This number consists of three payments of approximately $10 million, from 2019-2021, and $5 million in 2022. In addition to the principal of the debt, the State owes an additional $2 million per year for maintenance up to 2024, for each original funding agreement. All this amounts to a total of $47.45 million still outstanding from Missouri, which is far from the $60 million that Hoskins mentioned. While this is the overall contribution still required of the State, the State Debt Report 2018 shows what St. Louis still owes on bonds. \"In addition to the State contribution, both St. Louis County and St. Louis City pay $5 million for the asset, interest and $1 million for maintenance each year. Payments began in fiscal year 1992 and ended in fiscal year 2022.\" Our Governor, Hoskins, noted that Missouri still owes $60 million on bonds issued to build the dome at the American Center. However, Chief of Staff of Hoskins indicated that his estimates were high and that the State debt report of 2018 showed that Missouri owed only $47.45 million of those bonds against the $60 million claimed by Hoskins. This is a simple number claim, and Hoskins was high on his assessment. We're mostly assessing the statement wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00756"}
