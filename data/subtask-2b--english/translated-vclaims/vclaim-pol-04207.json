Ken said, \"Here's what Hillary and I won't do. And I want to make this very simple. We will never engage in a dangerous scheme to privatize social security. Donald Trump wrote a book and said, \"Social security is a Ponzi scheme and privatization will be good for all of us.\" Penny replied that \"All Donald Trump and I said about social security is that we will fulfil our obligations to our elderly. That's it.\" Kane said, \"Go read the book.\" The wording of Ken was cautious, but it gave the clear impression that Trump would characterize the retirement programme while Ken and Clinton would protect the existing system. As it turns out, Kane is on target with reference to the Ponzi scheme in Tramp's book. However, it is difficult for Cain to use a 16-year-old book as evidence that the Tramp-Pines ticket will \"involve into a risky scheme to privatize social security.\" As we have noted before, social security benefits for today &apos; s beneficiaries come from tax revenues on salaries paid by younger and middle-aged workers. Over the years, however, some conservatives have been pushed to convert social security into a system where workers invest at least part of their money to provide retirement. The positive aspect, as the proponents say, is that the nest eggs can be much higher, given that historical rates of return from private investment are higher than social security rates. The downside is the possibility of market losses. Although social security funds are more likely to be invested conservatively than many private investments, doing so will continue to run the risk that beneficiaries will lose their value or, at worst, their savings will be wiped out altogether. Neither can be achieved under the current social security programme. The most prominent suggestion was in 2005, when President George W. Bush drew up a plan to allow workers under the age of 55 to invest part of social security taxes in \"personal retirement accounts.\" Although the Republicans were in control of Congress at the time, the idea did not gather much enthusiasm, and died without even being presented as legislation. A few years later, President Paul Ryan, R-Wiss -- who in 2012 will become the candidate for the post of President of the General Democratic Party, Met Romney, and now acts as speaker in the House of Representatives -- made a similar proposal, allowing workers under the age of 55 to start investing part of social security taxes in a series of government-run funds. Nor did this idea go anywhere in Congress. These failures reinforced the old traditional wisdom that changing the way social security operates is the \"third track\" of politics (i.e., touch it and die). This opposition to change is particularly strong among older voters, who rely on social security and tend to vote at higher than average rates. For this reason, declarations of attack targeting social security have prevailed over the years, often broadcast by Democrats, although at times Republicans. Attacks on plans such as Bush and Ryan have often played the term \"privatization\" as a frightening concept -- so much so that supporters of this kind of proposal have made a great effort to separate their plans from those terms. On January 10, 2021, the book Tramp mentioned \"Maddous Verification of Special Facts\" in the story of \"Tramb refers to the law of rebellion - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 January 11, 2012, in the Trump 2000 book, America we deserve, directly compares social security with the Ponzi scheme. Trump wrote at some point: \"America's workers were forced to invest a sixth of our wages in the huge Ponzi scheme.\" The pyramids are made of Babir Maash. He also wrote in the book, according to Bazved, \"This is the second year in which social security benefits are paid. Even after inflation was taken into account, the first beneficiaries of social security received the equivalent of 36.5 per cent of the annual interest rate in their initial contributions to the Social Security Trust Fund. For those who retired in 1956, their inflation rate of return was still 12 per cent respected. In the National Journal, Julie Kosterlitz compares this figure with this: for those who are now working and are looking to retire after 2015, their return will be less than 2 per cent. This is if they get any pay at all. Did the name Bonze suddenly appear on your mind? \" In his book, Trump suggested that \"each American should be allowed to allocate a portion of their salary taxes to a personal social security account in which they can own and invest in shares and bonds. Federal guidelines can make sure that your money is diversified, that it invests in sound cooperative funds or securities, not in Imo farms.\" So Ken has a point that Trump once supported partial privatization of social security and called it the Bonze scheme. But that was 16 years ago, and the Clinton campaign gave us no further evidence after the end of the debate. What about Trump's attitude today? As stated, Trump &apos; s views on social security as a candidate were somewhat unusual among the major Republicans in rejecting any call for reform of benefits, including social security. It was also fairly consistent during the electoral campaign - a statement that we cannot make on other policy issues. In September 2015, he said in CBS 60 minutes, \"What I want to do is recover money from other countries that kill us and I want to save social security. We're gonna save him no more. We're not gonna raise the age and everything's gonna be okay.\" He told a crowd in Georgia in February: \"We will save your social security without making any cuts. Remember my words.\" He also responded to a questionnaire conducted by the Association in June on making social security more accessible in the future, focusing mainly on economic reforms, and did not mention any proposals to change the structure of the benefit programme. \"If we are able to develop the economy, increase the tax base, return capital and jobs to the United States and encourage foreign direct investment, we will strengthen our current entitlement programmes.\" Our governor, Ken, said that Trump would be involved in a dangerous scheme to privatize social security. Ken mentioned an old situation, but it needs an update. In 2000, Trump supported privatization and called social security the Bonze Plan. But now, 16 years later, Trump has provided relatively vague - but relatively consistent - data that supports maintaining the structure of the programme as it is, without the age of major changes such as special accounts. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that give a different impression, so we often assess it wrong. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f5ba48df-5efa-48ca-aa2d-4104c36b02e3", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04207"}
