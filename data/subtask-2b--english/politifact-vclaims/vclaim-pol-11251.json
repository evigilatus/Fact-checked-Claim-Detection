Earmarks are money sent to constituents for pet projects by members of Congress.\n\nLast year, we ruled that Radtke\u2019s claim that Allen \"had 40,000 earmarks\" was False. Her campaign sought to clarify her words, saying Radtke\u2019s statement merely meant Allen had voted for that many earmarks. We did not accept their explanation and pointed out several other claims by Radtke that suggested Allen personally requested all that pork.\n\nThis time around, Radtke has altered her verb and given us a new claim to check. Did Allen really vote for 40,000 earmarks during his Senate term?\n\nChuck Hansen, a spokesman for the campaign, said the number is based on a calculation by the Citizens Against Government Waste, a nonprofit group that tracks earmarks and releases annual reports of \"pork projects.\"\n\nAllen, as a senator, voted on the budgets from fiscal years 2002 to 2006. The 2007 budget did not pass until late January of that year, a few weeks after Allen left the Senate. He was defeated the previous fall by Democrat Jim Webb.\n\nThe five budgets Allen voted on included 52,319 earmarks valued at $121.8 billion, according to the Citizens Against Government Waste. Hansen said that Radtke\u2019s campaign, seeking to be conservative in its claim, chopped off about 25 percent the Citizens\u2019 numbers and estimated Allen voted for 40,000 earmarks valued at $90 billion.\n\nBut there\u2019s an important fact that Radtke omits: Allen did not vote on each earmark individually. They were attached to about four dozen major appropriations bills that Allen supported during his time in the Senate. Those bills authorized a total of about $4.4 trillion in discretionary spending programs -- including defense, education and justice -- and the earmarks added up to less three percent of that total.\n\nEven the watchdog groups that have criticized earmarks as wasteful don\u2019t totally blame Allen for supporting appropriations bills that kept government operating.\n\n\"If anyone against earmarks voted against appropriations bills, we wouldn\u2019t get anything done,\" said Leslie Paige, media director for Citizens Against Government Waste. \"We don\u2019t think that\u2019s very telling. We would really rather look at what the member of Congress requested in earmarks and what bills they introduced on their own.\"\n\nSteve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, said Allen didn\u2019t necessarily support \"each and every earmark.\" He cited the $225 million \"Bridge to Nowhere,\" connecting the city of Ketchikan, Alaska, with the Island of Gravina, which has 50 residents.\n\nAllen voted for a \u00a0$286.5 billion highway and transportation bill in 2005 that funded the bridge. Later that year, he got a chance vote specifically on the earmark, when a measure came up to move funding from the Alaska project to a bridge damaged by Hurricane Katrina on I-10 in New Orleans. Allen was one of 15 supporters of the unsuccessful amendment.\n\nEllis, however, does not not give Allen a free pass on earmarks. He noted a few lawmakers -- including Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. -- who voted against spending bills because they objected to earmarks. \u00a0\n\nAllen \"was part of the system and certainly got earmarks when he was in office as well,\" Ellis said. \"You don\u2019t get a total mulligan because the earmarks were part of much larger bills, but it does need that context.\"\n\nWe don\u2019t know how many of those earmarks Allen actually sponsored or requested. Members of Congress weren\u2019t required to disclose whether they requested a particular line item until the year after he left office in 2008. During Allen\u2019s term, Virginia received 1,135 earmarks, valued at about $1.2 billion, which could have been requested by any of Virginia\u2019s 13-member delegation.\n\nAllen clearly sought pork for Virginia. \"Every single earmark I\u2019ve gotten, I\u2019m proud of,\" he told a town hall meeting in Chesterfield County on March 20, 2006, according to a Richmond Times-Dispatch article. Allen said then that legislators who attach earmarks to appropriations bills should be identified.\n\nA few months later, Allen and other members of Virginia's congressional delegation refused cooperate with a Times-Dispatch reporter\u2019s request to identify the earmarks they requested during fiscal 2006. \u00a0\n\nIn this year\u2019s campaign, Allen is calling for a ban on earmarks until the federal budget is balanced. Afterwards, earmarks would require a two-thirds majority.\n\nOur ruling:\n\nRadtke claims that Allen, during his term in the Senate, voted for 40,000 earmarks.\n\nWe have one quibble. Allen did not vote on the earmarks individually. The items were attached to massive appropriations bills supported by Allen that kept the federal government operating. The earmarks amounted to less than 3 percent of the spending contained in those laws.\n\nBut unlike a few lawmakers, Allen never protested the secretive earmark process by voting against an appropriations bill. He went along with the system and said he was \"proud\" of the earmarks he got for Virginia.\n\nThe appropriations bills Allen backed had 52,319 earmarks, according to the Citizens Against Government Waste. Radtke attaches a smaller number to Allen, but we won\u2019t penalize her for understating her case.\n\nSo Radtke\u2019s statement is accurate but needs clarification. We rate it Mostly True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11251"}
