The figure is the number of African Americans who have submitted this $28 billion Missouri budget, which is zero.\" In speaking of diversity and inclusiveness, Pearson said that the leadership of the State should be taken into account. It is concerned about the lack of African-American representation in decisions on how to allocate $28 billion of State funds. We wanted to know if Pearson was right. Who's presenting the budget? First, a brief account of how the State budget process works: the heads of state departments make presentations to the Budget Committee of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate Appropriations Committee. In these presentations, heads of departments in the executive branch discuss the financial needs of their departments with legislators responsible for allocating funds to departments. The executive branch consists of 16 executive departments and six elected state-wide officials. :: Cody Smith, Chairman of the Budget Committee of the House of Representatives. His Chief of Staff, Chris Dunn, explained that directors of State departments or elected officials and their director of finance usually submitted their department budget. He stressed that the budget committee did not choose who submitted the budget, and that the budget departments made that decision internally. According to minutes from the Missouri House of Representatives, each government department but one submitted its management budget to the House Budget Committee. Clora Lindley-Myers is the Director of the Department of Insurance, Financial Institutions and Professional Registration, an African-American, but has not submitted a budget for its management. Lori Corrie, speaking on behalf of the Section, said in an e-mail, \"Director Lindley Myers was unable to attend the January 31 presentation to the Budget Committee of the House of Representatives because of a previous commitment. She was attending the meeting of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.\" The Deputy Director and Budget Officer of the Department had been introduced in her absence, but Lindley-Miers had already submitted to the Senate Appropriations Committee, as Kroi had said. On January 12, 2021, he wrote in an Instagram article saying that Joe Biden remained silent about the violence in Black Lives-Mite protests. \u2022 16 January 2021: lack of diversity in the employment of African-Americans who present the State budget reflects greater concern: the lack of African-Americans in senior positions in state-wide offices. Of the 22 offices in the executive branch, only 2 are headed by non-whites. We talked to Steele Sheppy, Goff's contact manager. Mike Parson. Chepe defended ethnic diversity in the ruling cabinet, referring to Lindley-Miers and Anna Hoi, Director of the State Department of Labour. According to the Ministry of Labour website, Hui is the first Asian American to serve in the Department of the Governor. It was appointed in March 2017 and approved in January 2018. Executive Directors are appointed by the Governor. Departmental directors do not always leave office with the Governor's rotation, as many of the current department directors are appointed by previous governments. Jay Nixon and Eric Greens. The Parsons Office refused to answer questions about the Bureau &apos; s awareness of the lack of diversity or efforts to promote diversity. Our judgment, Pearson, said no African American has submitted the state budget to the House Budget Committee. According to the records of the House of Representatives and other sources, he is right. The sole Director of the African Department of State, Chlora Lindley Myers, was not submitted to the House Budget Committee because of an earlier commitment in its schedule. We're assessing this statement right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00852"}
