In a search for the quote online, Google returned two results: a link to a Facebook page where someone had posted it in a comment, and a June 2019 blog post titled, \"Kamala Harris buries Joe Biden.\"\u00a0\nThe blog post is supportive of Harris, then still a presidential candidate, and praises her performance during a debate.\u00a0\nThe statement that appears in the Facebook post is also in the blog post, but it\u2019s not in a quote attributed to Harris. Rather, it\u2019s the blog post\u2019s author who writes: \"I don\u2019t like Joe Biden and do not like his history with certain people or who he\u2019s aligned with, he\u2019s trash to me.\"\nWe rate this Facebook post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17144"}
