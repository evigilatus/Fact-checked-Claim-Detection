Four police officers involved in the incident were fired. The officer who knelt on Floyd\u2019s neck was taken into custody and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter on May 29.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe video shows police who were dispatched to a Minneapolis store May 25 after receiving a 911 call alleging that Floyd had paid with a counterfeit bill. Two officers detain Floyd near a police car; one of them has his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck.\u00a0\n\"Please, I can't breathe,\" Floyd says in the video, before going silent after several minutes of pleading with police.\nAnother angle of the encounter shows three officers watching as the arresting officer, Derek Chauvin, presses his knee into Floyd\u2019s neck. Law enforcement experts have broadly condemned the technique.\nThe FBI and Justice Department are investigating Floyd\u2019s death as a possible violation of federal civil rights laws. Hennepin County and federal prosecutors are also looking into the possibility of bringing additional charges against the officers involved in the incident. We reached out to the Minneapolis Police Department for a comment, but we haven\u2019t heard back.\nNone of the investigations have disputed that the video shows Floyd\u2019s death \u2014\u00a0and that Chauvin kneeled on Floyd\u2019s neck, killing him.\nThe nearly 1,000-word Facebook post weaves together a series of speculations and unrelated facts, the motives of the officers and the timing of the incident to spin an unproven conspiracy theory. None of it confirms that the incident was staged.\nConspiracy theories that allege a tragedy was either staged or fabricated commonly circulate online following major news events. False claims that Floyd\u2019s death was staged first started bubbling up in Facebook groups for supporters of President Donald Trump on May 27. From there, they spread to other conspiratorial groups, according to CrowdTangle, an audience analytics tool.\nThe Facebook post is inaccurate and makes a ridiculous claim.
