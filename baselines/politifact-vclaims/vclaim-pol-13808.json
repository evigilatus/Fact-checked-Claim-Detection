Russo started 2011 by appointing entrepreneur Dan T. Moore III to the Cleveland Metroparks Board, he cited Moore's knowledge of the Towpath Trail as one key factor.\n\nThe original Towpath Trail -- constructed 175 years ago as part of the Ohio & Erie Canal -- was \u00a0a simple dirt path on which mules walked to tow canal boats. The modern-day version is a multi-purpose trail of asphalt and crushed limestone open to hikers, cyclists and, in some sections, horseback riders.\n\nWhen completed, the trail will stretch 101 miles from the Lake Erie shore in Cleveland to New Philadelphia. More than 80 miles are done. Obstacles including railroad tracks and industrial contamination have made it difficult to complete the remaining fragments in Cleveland, Akron and Barberton.\n\nMoore, who rides the trail regularly, called it \"a wonderful, magical and phenomenal resource.\n\n\"Unfortunately,\" he said, \"it's taken more time to complete the Towpath Trail than it did to build the Canal, and that's tragic. We need to cut through the politics. I think less talk and more doing is a good idea.\"\n\nThat caught the attention of PolitiFact Ohio. We knew that completing the Towpath Trail became more of a marathon than a walk in the park. But has it really taken longer to complete than it took to build the original canal?\n\nWe thought it might be a good time for a brief history lesson.\n\nThe Ohio & Erie Canal was 308 miles long. Its main channels were 26 feet wide at the base and 40 feet wide at the water line.\n\nIt was built before the steam shovel was invented, so to construct the canal, laborers had to chop a path through the forest and then dig it using picks, shovels and wheelbarrows.\n\nThe work started in 1825. It was finished in 1832 -- or, says the Ohio Historical Commission, \"by 1833.\"\n\nThe National Park Service started work on the Towpath Trail in the mid-1980s, a decade after President Gerald Ford signed the bill establishing the Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area. The trail\u2019s first segment -- a stretch through the park of nearly 20 miles -- opened in 1993.\n\nCompletion of the trail in Cuyahoga County \u00a0is now scheduled for 2014, according to the Cuyahoga County Planning Commission. The Cleveland Metroparks will handle day-to-day maintenance and security for the trail, and city of Cleveland will own the land under it.\n\nThe Ohio & Erie Canalway Coalition says its goal is to complete the full Towpath Trail, from Cleveland to New Philadelphia, by 2020.\n\nAdding it all up, work on the Towpath Trail started no later than 1990. The portion within Cuyahoga County -- which is the portion involving Cleveland Metroparks -- is scheduled to be finished in 2014. That\u2019s a span of 24 years.\n\nConstruction of the canal that the original towpath once serviced took seven years.\n\nWe rate Moore\u2019s statement as True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarcy Kaptur\n\n\nstated on February 29, 2012 in a House of Representatives floor speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Lake Erie contains more native fish than all the other Great Lakes combined.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Sabrina Eaton \u2022 March 22, 2012", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13808"}
