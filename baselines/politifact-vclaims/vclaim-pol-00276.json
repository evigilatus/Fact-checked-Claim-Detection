Not exactly", "text": "Loads of people on the internet are convinced that a portion of every Bang energy drink sale goes directly to President Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign or other Trump 2020 efforts.\u00a0\nThe connection between the energy drink company and President Trump is not as direct as this rumor makes it out to be.\nA viral Facebook post shared Aug. 5 has amassed more than 500 comments and 3,600 shares. It features an image of a Bang energy drink with someone holding up their middle finger in front of it. The body of the post reads,\"Didn\u2019t know but just found this out that every-time you purchased a bang a portion of your money helps re-election Donald Trump & goes to the fund campaign for MAGA! This is a break up ..... I can\u2019t support a company that helps support a Man that puts children in cages, who promotes racisms, who is a white supremacist etc.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nNo, a portion of every Bang energy drink purchase does not directly fund Trump\u2019s re-election efforts, but the parent company of Bang \u2014 Vital Pharmeceuticals \u2014 did donate a large sum of money to a pro-Trump PAC.\nThe rumor started after Axios published a story on July 31, 2019, that reported pro-Trump super PAC America First Action and its affiliated nonprofit, America First Policies, raised nearly $18 million in the first half of 2019.\nThe story identified some of the committee\u2019s top donors: real estate developer Geoffrey Palmer gave $2 million, former Small Business Administration leader and wrestling executive Linda McMahon gave $1 million, and Vital Pharmaceuticals donated $250,000. According to Federal Election Commission filings, it is the only contribution the company has made.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe website Popular Info picked up on the Bang-Vital Pharmaceuticals connection from the report and published a subsequent story on Aug. 1 with the headline, \"Every can of this energy drink helps Trump get re-elected.\"\nIt didn\u2019t take long for the claim to spill over into social media posts of former Bang devotees saying they are giving up the energy drink because of its political affiliation.\nBut the story and social media posts overstate the energy drink\u2019s connection to Trump\u2019s re-election campaign or related PACs. Yes, its parent company donated $250,000 to a pro-Trump super PAC, but there is no direct distribution from a portion of every energy drink purchased. Neither Bang\u2019s website nor its social media accounts advertise any kind of political fundraising campaign. PolitiFact also reached out to the company, but did not immediately hear back.\nHowever, Vital Pharmaceuticals CEO and Bang energy drink founder Jack Owoc and his wife Meg Liz Owoc have been outspoken in their support for Trump in the past.\n@realDonaldTrump Your brilliance has fueled the most epic turn of events in the history of politics.
