The 30 states that Trump took in 2016 had recorded 97,329 deaths in total as of Sept. 28, 2020. Here\u2019s the breakdown, according to a New York Times case and death tracker:\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.

He's saying, if you live in a state like Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, states with Democratic governors, you're not his problem. He has no obligation to you,\" the former vice president said.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s defining blue states as states with Democratic governors, which Trump himself may have been getting at with his comment about blue states, in which, at one point, he cited \"blue state-managed\" leadership.\u00a0\nIt still doesn\u2019t make Trump\u2019s claim accurate. It does, however, make Biden\u2019s a bit less of a bullseye.\nThe 26 states whose governors are currently Republicans had a combined total of 83,695 deaths as of Sept. 28, 2020, behind Brazil and India, coming in third in the world. Here\u2019s the breakdown:\u00a0\nAlabama 2,501; Alaska, 52; Arizona, 5,624; Arkansas, 1,329; Florida, 14,036; Georgia, 6,803; Idaho, 460; Indiana, 3,591; Iowa, 1,321; Maryland, 3,938; Massachusetts, 9,415; Mississippi, 2,921; Missouri, 2,119; Nebraska, 487; New Hampshire, 439; North Dakota, 237; Ohio, 4,746; Oklahoma, 1,007; South Carolina, 3,337; South Dakota, 218; Tennessee, 2,362; Texas, 15,854; Utah, 453; Vermont, 58; West Virginia, 337; Wyoming, 50.\u00a0\nStill, the facts here are clear. No one can split the nation in half based on political parties to spin death counts one way or another.\u00a0\nOur death toll is what it is, and it is high \u2014 the highest in the world, by more than 50,000. Even when adjusted for population, the United States ranks 11th in the world for total deaths.\u00a0\nOur rating\u00a0\nBiden claimed that the U.S. death total from the coronavirus in red states alone would rank second in the world.\u00a0\nDepending on how one interprets \"red states,\" this is either spot-on or close to accurate.\u00a0\nWe rate his claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18591"}
