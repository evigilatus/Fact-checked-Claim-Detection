Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., continue to give our readers pause.\nWe\u2019ve twice debunked wild posts claiming Bachmann said Jesus wrote the Bible in English and that she said President Barack Obama might be responsible for the April Fort Hood, Texas, shooting spree. Both quotes were made up, so they got our Pants on Fire rating.\nRecently, a reader asked us to investigate a third post, a screenshot of Bachmann in mid speech with a quote overlay.\n\"The nation has gotten away from the principles of the founding fathers under the failed leadership of Barack Obama. This country could use a president like Benjamin Franklin again,\" the posts quotes Bachmann as saying on Fox News on May 28.\nIf this were a baseball game, we\u2019d call \"strike three!\" Yes, Bachmann is no fan of Obama. Yes, she is known to bring up the founding fathers, sometimes to controversial ends.\nBut no, she did not remember iconic American Ben Franklin as a past president.\u00a0Franklin signed the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution, served as the nation\u2019s first postmaster general and later as U.S. ambassador to France. But he was never president.\nA search of transcripts and news stories for the quote came up dry.\nBachmann spokesman Dat Kotman said she did not even appear on Fox that day, and we could not find any evidence that she did.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs if the meme weren't\u00a0fishy enough, the screenshot is also the backdrop for the fake quote about Fort Hood. It\u2019s originally from Bachmann\u2019s June 2013 interview on Fox News\u2019 Hannity when she discussed her decision to leave Congress at the end of her term in January 2015. The post appears to track back to a satirical group called \"Christians for Michele Bachmann.\"\nBachmann did extol Franklin in a high-profile address, but she did not refer to him as a president. She referenced Franklin twice in a speech announcing that she was abandoning her 2012 presidential bid.\nBachmann alluded to a painting by Howard Chandler Christy of the signing of the U.S. Constitution, which hangs in a stairway in the Capitol\u2019s House wing. She remembers seeing the painting, with its reminder of the \"connection we have to the principles of freedom and justice,\" on the night she decided to seek the Oval Office. Benjamin Franklin is seated distinctly in the center of the painting, one of the most visible figures in a sea of powdered wigs.\n\"But never was the painting's reminder more poignant than on the evening of March 21, 2010, the day Obamacare was passed,\" Bachmann said. \"Staring out from the painting is the face of Ben Franklin as a consistent reminder of the fragile Republic he and the founders gave to us.\"\nShe did not refer to him as a past president then, and we could not find other examples of her mistaking him for a president.\nOur ruling\nA meme claims that Bachmann said, \"This country could use a president like Benjamin Franklin again.\" This\u00a0quote is made up.\nBachmann wasn't on TV the night of her alleged remarks and we could find no reference of her claiming Franklin was president.
