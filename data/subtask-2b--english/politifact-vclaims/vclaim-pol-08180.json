The award went to 12 Years a Slave, the powerful true story of a black man kidnapped and sold into slavery in the Deep South during the mid-1800s.\nIn accepting the award, director Steve McQueen delivered an emotional tribute.\n\"Everyone deserves not just to survive, but to live. This is the most important legacy of Solomon Northup,\" McQueen said. \"I dedicate this award to all the people who have endured slavery. And the 21 million people who still suffer slavery today.\"\nBecause we\u2019re PunditFact, we can\u2019t even watch the Oscars without our ears perking up at such a statistic, especially when millions of people potentially heard it, too. So we decided to put McQueen\u2019s claim on the Truth-O-Meter.\nModern slavery is often referred to today as \"forced labor\" or sometimes \"trafficking in persons.\" It\u2019s not as easily defined as the slave trade of the antebellum American South, nor is it simple to identify victims.\nThe United States Trafficking Victims Protection Act defines trafficking in persons two ways. There is sex trafficking \"in which a commercial sex act is induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or in which the person induced to perform such an act has not attained 18 years of age.\" Then there\u2019s a more general category: \"the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for labor or services, through the use of force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of subjection to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery.\"\nThere are many different examples of modern slavery worldwide. The International Labor Organization, a United Nations agency, looks for 11 indicators to identify forced labor:\n\n\nAbuse of vulnerability\n\n\nDeception\n\n\nRestriction of movement\n\n\nIsolation\n\n\nPhysical and sexual violence\n\n\nIntimidation and threats\n\n\nRetention of identity documents\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWithholding of wages\n\n\nDebt bondage\n\n\nAbusive working and living conditions\n\n\nExcessive overtime.\n\n\nEstimates on modern slavery vary because victims are difficult to identify and do not often come forward.\nThe United Nation\u2019s International Labor Organization believes the best way to get statistics on slavery is through national surveys, but so far \"only a handful of countries have undertaken special surveys on this topic.\" As a result \"the practice is extremely difficult to research and quantify as it is most often hidden and out-of-sight of law enforcement.\"\nBecause of this, only 46,570 victims were formally documented by law enforcement agencies internationally in 2012, according to the U.S. State Department\u2019s 2013 Trafficking in Persons Report.\nStill, overall estimates exist.\nThe International Labor Organization estimated in June 2012 that 20.9 million individuals were in forced labor. This included 15.4 million adults and 5.5 million children. About 55 percent are women or girls.\nBy far, the most common purveyor of forced labor is in Asia, where 11.7 million are in slave-like conditions. Africa is second at 3.7 million.\nLabor exploitation is most common worldwide with 14.2 million forced laborers, while 4.5 million are exploited for sex. State-enforced labor entraps 2.2 million, the group estimated.\nThe organization has changed how it calculates the figure. As recently as 2005, the estimate for forced laborers was much smaller, at 12 million people, so identifying trends is not possible using their data.\nOther organizations, however, have estimated that the figure is much higher. Luis CdeBaca, the Ambassador-at-Large in the Office To Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, testified to Congress in 2013 that there were \"up to 27 million people living in slavery.\" A State Department spokesman told us that language was agreed to after consulting with industry experts.\nThe Walk Free Foundation, an international organization committed to ending modern slavery, estimates the figure at between 28.3 million and 31.3 million in its Global Slavery Index.\nWe reached out to McQueen\u2019s representation to see if they could provide a source for his claim. If we hear back, we\u2019ll update the post.\nOur ruling \nIn his acceptance speech, McQueen said he dedicated his Oscar to the \"21 million people who still suffer slavery today.\" That figure is based on a 2012 estimate from the International Labor Organization, a United Nations agency. Estimates vary across organizations, and a true headcount is nearly impossible to predict with any certainty. Still, McQueen cited the estimate of the international community\u2019s most reliable source. We rate his statement Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08180"}
