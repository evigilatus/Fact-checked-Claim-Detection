Rush Holt (D-12th) said in a December press release. \"That is the daily average, it is intolerable, and it has to stop.\"\n\nThat would mean 126 veterans every week or 6,570 every year, across the nation. As shocking as that might seem, Holt\u2019s statistic is accurate, PolitiFact New Jersey found.\n\nThe statistic was confirmed in a Dec. 15, 2007 email exchange between Dr. Ira R. Katz, deputy chief officer of Mental Health Services at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and Dr. Michael J. Kussman, then the under secretary for health at the Veterans Health Administration, which is part of the VA.\n\nThe statistic was cited in a CBS News investigation that revealed 6,200 veterans committed suicide in 2005.\n\nWhen Kussman, a retired Army brigaider general, asked Katz in an email if reports by a media organization about the statistic were accurate, Katz responded: \"There are about 18 suicides per day among America\u2019s 25 million veterans. This follows from CDC (Centers for Disease Control) findings that 20% of suicides are among veterans. It is supported by the CBS numbers. VA\u2019s own data demonstrates 4-5 suicides per day among those who receive care from us.\"\n\nHolt spokesman Thomas Seay referred us to a U.S. Court of Appeals 9th Circuit opinion from May 10, 2011 that cites the same statistic from Katz. The opinion criticized the VA\u2019s handling and processing of claims and benefits for veterans in a lawsuit brought by two nonprofit veterans groups against the VA, several of its officials and the federal government.\n\nThe VA said in an emailed statement that the actual numbers of veteran suicides isn\u2019t known, but considers the statistic of an average of 18 per day its best estimate.\n\nLimited data is an issue, Seay said.\n\n\"Some efforts are underway to improve data collection, particularly as relates to the effectiveness of specific interventions: \u00a0for example, the Vet2Vet program run out of UMDNJ in Piscataway is working hard to measure the impact of its counseling services,\" Seay said in an email. \" Even so, better national data would help to guide better policy.\"\n\nSuicide factors for veterans are similar to those for nonveterans, said Jeremy Willinger, director of communications and marketing for the Mental Health Association of New York City.\n\n\"In the general population, suicide risk factors include male gender, older age, diminished support (e.g. homelessness or unmarried status), availability of firearms, and co-occurring physical and mental conditions,\" Willinger said in an email. \"This profile describes a large portion of the veteran population.\n\n\"Nearly 50 percent of military suicides in 2010 occurred at the hands of privately-owned weapons,\" Willinger added.\n\nBob Handy, chairman of California-based Veterans United For Truth, one of the suit\u2019s plaintiffs, said 18 veteran suicides a day is accurate but believes the number might be low \"because that\u2019s veterans involved with the Veterans Administration.\"\n\n\"When we filed our lawsuit on June 23, 2007 until the end of last year there were 29,000 veterans who had killed themselves,\" said Handy, a Korea and Vietnam veteran.\n\n\"If a veteran\u2019s family or the veteran himself felt like he or she was thinking of taking his own life pick up the telephone and call 9-1-1 or the appropriate medical people and not necessarily wait for the VA to call them back,\" he added.\n\nOur ruling\n\nIn announcing Congressional approval of $40 million that he sought to support suicide prevention programs for the military, Holt in a December press release said an average of 18 veterans commit suicide daily. The VA said that figure is the best estimate it has. A U.S. Court of Appeals \u00a0opinion as well as email exchanges between VA officials and a statistical analysis undertaken by a national news network all cite that statistic. We rate the claim True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShelley Adler\n\n\nstated on May 4, 2012 in an interview on NJTV\u2019s \u201cOn the Record\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Jon Runyan voted to \"end programs to aid homeless veterans.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Erin O'Neill \u2022 May 24, 2012\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo comment on this ruling, go to\u00a0NJ.com.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11709"}
