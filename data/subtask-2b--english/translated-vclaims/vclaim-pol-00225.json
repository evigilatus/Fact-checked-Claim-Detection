Throughout the country, the states spend on average more people locked up than students. Sanders may have focused on the state of Palmito because its main democratic vote on February 29 represents the first real test of the power of candidates with black voters, who refer to criminal justice and education as crucial issues. In 2016, Sanders lost the American-African vote to Hillary Clinton by an amazing 50 percentage point. The numbers of Sanders have been verified. However, the gap between South Carolina spending on prisons and schools is nowhere near the greatest disparity between states. The reflection of priorities in Sanders is correct: South Carolina spent an average of $21,756 on each of its approximately 20,000 inmates in 2018, according to the budget paper of the Department of Corrections of South Carolina transmitted to us by the Sanders campaign. During the school year 2017-18, the state of Palmito spent an average of $11,525 per student. This data is derived from the National Education Association &apos; s annual evaluation, to which the Sanders campaign referred. This is a difference of about $10,000 in prisons more than in schools. We heard from the Corrections Department official in South Carolina who argued against Sanders' claim, saying that comparing prisoners at a cost each year with students \"is not comparing apples with apples.\" \"Consistency includes round-the-clock care, housing, clothing, nutrition, medical care, mental health care, programming and 24-hour security, as well as education costs,\" the spokesperson said. Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" \u2022 January 26, 2012, but other experts with whom we spoke said that comparison was a reasonable way of measuring State priorities. \"It is difficult to say that spending on prisons twice as much on schools does not reflect some distorted priorities,\" said David Beals, Professor of Education at Iowa University. According to international standards, the United States has too many people in prison, and according to international standards it is underinvestment in education. The disparity between prison and school spending is not unique for South Carolina - it is the same throughout the country. We compared the latest data on the expenditure of the State Prison from the Vera Institute of Justice, a think tank for criminal justice, with the expenditure of public schools in each state by the National Education Society. The average expenditure on prisoners in each state was higher than the average expenditure on students, based on data available from 2015, which included 45 states. On average, these states spent $11,709 per student and $33,274 per prisoner, or almost three times as much as schools spent on prisons. Of the states that we compared, South Carolina ranked ninth between the lowest differences in spending on prisoners and students. If Sanders wanted to highlight the biggest disparity - $53,497 - he would have been transferred to deep blue California. In 2015, Sacramento spent an average of approximately $65,000 per prisoner, almost double the state-wide average. In the same year, California spent nearly the state average on education per pupil, which is just over $11,000. \"I believe this is generally a reasonable comparison of the priorities of the State,\" said Mark Maur, Executive Director of the sentencing project. \"In many states, spending on corrections has increased at a much higher rate than education over the past several decades.\" Our sentence, Sanders, said, \"Last year, South Carolina spent $21,756 per prisoner and $11,552 per student.\" Sanders is right that South Carolina spends more on average per prisoner than a student last year. However, the disparity in prison spending versus school spending is true throughout the country, and in most states the gap is wider than in South Carolina. We're assessing this mostly right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00225"}
