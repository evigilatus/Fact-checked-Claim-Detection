And all of this has helped to make Austin one of the fastest-growing cities in America.\"\n\nWe know tech is big in these parts, but does it drive more than a quarter of Austin\u2019s economy?\n\nBy email, White House spokesman Bobby Whithorne pointed out a press release issued earlier in May by the\u00a0Austin Technology Council, a trade association for companies working in and around technology and life sciences. The release said the council had released results of its \"Technology Economic Impact Report\" finding that \"technology is generating billions of dollars annually and driving more than a quarter of Austin's local economy.\"\n\nBut the May 6, 2013, report doesn\u2019t exactly say that, though it quantifies the area\u2019s tech boom in various ways.\n\nThe report says: \"While a respectable 9% of total employment is in technology (more than 100,000 jobs), more than one third of all jobs in the Austin economy are supported by the technology sector, including direct hiring and spin-off hiring activity.\"\n\nReference No. 2: \"The sector accounts for a whopping 21% of Central Texas\u2019 gross regional product (GRP) and contributes $21 (billion) in direct value to the local economy.\" Researcher Brian Kelsey later told us by email that the government sector swept in about 12 percent of local output.\n\nThe council put us in touch with Brian Kelsey, a principal at Austin-based Civic Analytics, which conducted the research behind the report.\n\nBy email, Kelsey told us the president\u2019s claim is true if one assumes he was talking about Austin tech\u2019s share of jobs plus spin-off jobs.\n\nFor the research, Kelsey said, he defined Austin\u2019s \"tech sector\" starting from the \"high-tech\" definition in TechAmerica Foundation\u2019s annual \"Cyberstates\" publication. Its list encompasses 52 industries, among them communications equipment such as radio and TV broadcasting and wireless communications equipment; software services; engineering services; computer training; and space and defense systems. Kelsey said his firm added another industry, computer and computer peripheral equipment and software merchant wholesalers, \"which captures a significant portion of business activity at some of Austin's larger companies such as Dell, IBM, etc.\"\n\nAll told, Kelsey said, the 53 industries \"contribute an estimated $20.9 billion to Austin's total Gross Regional Product,\" meaning the economic output in the five-county metropolitan region, \"of approximately $97.4 billion, or roughly 21 percent, a bit under \u2018one-quarter.\u2019\"\n\nKelsey said total estimated employment (full-time, part-time, and self-employment) in Austin's tech sector accounted for 105,667 jobs in 2012, roughly 9 percent of all jobs in Austin. \"That's direct jobs--i.e. people employed in the 53 industries. If you look at the direct employment and the spin-off activity it creates in other industries (the multiplier effect), the tech sector supports an estimated one-third of total employment in Austin--so a bit more than \u2018one-quarter,\u2019\" he said. He added that most of the data behind the report, including the jobs multiplier of 3.5, came from Idaho-based Economic Modeling Specialists Intl., a company that specializes in economic impact studies.\n\nFinally, we asked Jon Hockenyos, president of Austin-based TXP, Inc., an economic consulting firm, to look over the council\u2019s study. Hockenyos said by email that the results looked accurate. Regarding Obama\u2019s reference, Hockenyos said: \"I\u2019d say the verb \u2018drives\u2019 (which to me implies more than the direct effect) makes the president\u2019s remark consistent with the study\u2019s findings.\"\n\nBy telephone, the White House\u2019s Whithorne stood by Obama\u2019s wording, saying it was supported by the press release announcing the study and the study itself.\n\nOur ruling\n\nObama said a report says the \"tech sector now drives more than one quarter of Austin\u2019s economy.\"\n\nThe cited report doesn't directly declare this, estimating instead that high-tech companies in the Austin region directly supplied about 9 percent of the area\u2019s jobs in 2012 and accounted for roughly 21 percent of the region's economic output.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen again, the report also says jobs in the tech sector plus spin-off jobs amounted to more than a third of the region\u2019s total jobs, which strikes us as sufficient to make Obama's claim partly accurate. We rate it as Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09323"}
