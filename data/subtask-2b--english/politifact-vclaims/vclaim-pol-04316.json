Loretta Sanchez to replace retiring Sen. Barbara Boxer in November\u2019s election. All three are Democrats.\nWe decided to check whether Harris stretched the truth in her claim about the rapid rise in America\u2019s prison population.\nOur research\nWe relied on data from the Sentencing Project. The criminal justice advocacy group is considered a credible source for incarceration figures. Its data was cited by the national PolitiFact team in a recent fact check on a similar claim.\nThe Sentencing Project\u2019s data show there are 2.2 million people in the nation\u2019s federal and state prisons and local jails -- a 500 percent increase over the past 40 years. For comparison, the overall United States population has increased just 51 percent during that period.\nAvailable numbers from the U.S. Justice Department\u2019s Bureau of Justice Statistics agree with those from the Sentencing Project.\nHarris\u2019 claim is slightly different in that it cites the nation\u2019s spike in \"prison population\" rather than a combined increase in prisons and jail figures.\nSome might read her statement as including both prison and jail inmates, but there\u2019s a significant difference between the two.\nTo assess Harris\u2019 more limited claim, we examined the rise of the prison population alone.\nThe Sentencing Project\u2019s data show the nation\u2019s prison population grew from 218,466 in 1974 to 1,508,636 in 2014, which is a nearly 600 percent increase.\nUnlike most politicians, it appears Harris understated her legitimate point.\n\nMore background\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in remarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHarris\u2019 claim and stance on prison reform is significant given California\u2019s overcrowded prisons.\nAt nearly 600,000 people, California has the second largest correctional population among states, behind only Texas\u2019 nearly 700,000, according to the U.S. Justice Department. Those figures include prison and jail inmates and people on probation and parole.\n\nSource: U.S. Justice Department\nHarris\u2019 claim centers on the rise of prison inmates over the past four decades. Over the past few years, however, America has seen a decline in prisoners. The nationwide total dropped about 100,000 from 2009 to 2014, according to the Sentencing Project.\nReforms in California account for much of that drop, as the state has reduced its prison population by about 50,000 following a 2009 federal court order to do so, according to a report by the Public Policy Institute of California.\nIn November, Californians will vote on Proposition 57, a measure proposed by Gov. Jerry Brown designed to ease the state\u2019s prison overcrowding. It would allow some offenders to be considered for parole earlier than now possible.\nA campaign spokesman said Harris has declined to take a position on Prop 57, or any ballot measure, because as attorney general she is charged with writing an independent summary and title for each measure.\nThe spokesman pointed to data from the Sentencing Project and other academic reports to back up Harris\u2019 claim about the prison population.\nOur ruling\nU.S. Senate candidate Kamala Harris recently said \"Over the last 40 years, this country\u2019s prison population has grown 500 percent.\"\nData show the nation\u2019s combined prison and jail population has grown 500 percent over this period.\nBut when isolating just the prison population, the data shows that group has soared by nearly 600 percent.\nNo matter how you crunch the numbers, they show a dramatic rise in incarceration -- one that actually exceeds what Harris stated.\nHer statement is on the right track, but needs this clarification.\nWe rate it Mostly True.\n\nMOSTLY TRUE\u00a0\u2013 The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.\nClick here for\u00a0more\u00a0on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/da79554e-4177-4b1f-a88b-0a25ee20818e", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04316"}
