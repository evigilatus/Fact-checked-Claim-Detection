0001	Donald Trump	Wow, thank you so much.
0002	Donald Trump	Hello, West Virginia.
0003	Donald Trump	What a place.
0004	Donald Trump	You know, we only won West Virginia by 42 points last time.
0005	Donald Trump	42 points.
0006	Donald Trump	You know what that is?
0007	Donald Trump	That's like  did anyone ever hear of 42 points  and we're going to better this time, OK?
0008	Donald Trump	But I'm thrilled to be back in this great state.
0009	Donald Trump	I love this state with thousands of hard working American patriots.
0010	Donald Trump	And what job numbers we had today.
0011	Donald Trump	Did you hear?
0012	Donald Trump	Did you hear?
0013	Donald Trump	We're going to that.
0014	Donald Trump	They all say speak about the economy.
0015	Donald Trump	Speak about the economy.
0016	Donald Trump	Well, we have the greatest economy in the history of our country... but sometimes it's not as exciting to talk about the economy, right?
0017	Donald Trump	Because we have a lot of other things to talk about.
0018	Donald Trump	Also, very important, the economy I unbelievable.
0019	Donald Trump	You know it better than anybody because your state under our great Governor Big Jim Justice wherever he may be.
0020	Donald Trump	Where is he?
0021	Donald Trump	Where's big Jim?
0022	Donald Trump	He's around here someplace.
0023	Donald Trump	One thing you can't miss him.
0024	Donald Trump	There he is.
0025	Donald Trump	You can't miss him.
0026	Donald Trump	He's got to be 6'11 and he's up there in the weight, but I won't get into it.
0027	Donald Trump	He's the greatest.
0028	Donald Trump	But I'm going to introduce him in a second.
0029	Donald Trump	But we're here to celebrate our amazing achievements together, to make America's incredible comeback continuing and we will.
0030	Donald Trump	Right now we're moving full speed ahead like nobody thought was possible.
0031	Donald Trump	They did not think it was possible.
0032	Donald Trump	They did not think it.
0033	Donald Trump	In just four days  so important.
0034	Donald Trump	Because you have a great candidate.
0035	Donald Trump	You have a couple of great candidates.
0036	Donald Trump	Carol is a great candidate also.
0037	Donald Trump	You know that.
0038	Donald Trump	Carol Miller.
0039	Donald Trump	In just four days the people of West Virginia are going to send Carol Miller to the House and Patrick Morrisey to the Senate so we making America great again.
0040	Donald Trump	This election will decide whether we build on the extraordinary prosperity that we've unleashed.
0041	Donald Trump	Nobody can believe what's happened.
0042	Donald Trump	Or whether we let the radical Democrats take control of Congress and take a giant wrecking ball to our economy and to our future.
0043	Donald Trump	America now has the best economy in the history of our country, and we want to keep it that way.
0044	Donald Trump	In last month alone we added  this just came out a few hours ago  250,000 jobs.
0045	Donald Trump	That's in the month of October, by the way.
0046	Donald Trump	That's for one month.
0047	Donald Trump	And nearly half a million Americans returned to the workforce.
0048	Donald Trump	We've created 4.5 million new jobs since the election, a number that was unthinkable.
0049	Donald Trump	If I would have said that during the campaign, oh they would have given me a hard time.
0050	Donald Trump	They would have said Pinocchio, you know, they do the whole thing.
0051	Donald Trump	Oh boy.
0052	Donald Trump	And we've lifted 4.3 million Americans off of food stamps.
0053	Donald Trump	The unemployment rate just fell to the lowest level in over 50 years.
0054	Donald Trump	More Americans are working today  think of this  than ever before.
0055	Donald Trump	More American today, right now, this hour, are working than ever before in the history of our country.
0056	Donald Trump	How good is that?
0057	Donald Trump	How do you lose that debate?
0058	Donald Trump	When we're debating a lefty, how do you lose the debate when they're looking at you and say well, we're going to look at jobs.
0059	Donald Trump	But more Americans in the history of our country.
0060	Donald Trump	I mean that to me is  here's another one.
0061	Donald Trump	AfricanAmericans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans unemployment have all reached the lowest levels in the history of our country.
0062	Donald Trump	How do you lose that in a debate?
0063	Donald Trump	How do you lose that in a debate?
0064	Donald Trump	It's always nice.
0065	Donald Trump	You know, when you go into a debate it is nice to have the facts on your side.
0066	Donald Trump	It's going to be very tough to beat.
0067	Donald Trump	Wages are rising and you know it's  it's been incredible.
0068	Donald Trump	And it just got announced they're going at the fastest pace in much more than a decade and wages went up.
0069	Donald Trump	First time in a long time.
0070	Donald Trump	They haven't gone up.
0071	Donald Trump	People were making more money 19 years ago.
0072	Donald Trump	I used to talk about it during the campaign.
0073	Donald Trump	Where people had single jobs and they were making more money than they had with two and three jobs today.
0074	Donald Trump	And now for the first time wages are going up, and they're going up nicely, and people have a choice of lots of different jobs.
0075	Donald Trump	And right here in West Virginia jobless claims reached the lowest level in the history of your state.
0076	Donald Trump	Is that good?
0077	Donald Trump	No wonder I won by 42 points.
0078	Donald Trump	No wonder.
0079	Donald Trump	But then it was just talk.
0080	Donald Trump	Remember?
0081	Donald Trump	When I came, I was campaigning.
0082	Donald Trump	What did you know?
0083	Donald Trump	I mean, it was another, "Can you believe politicians?"
0084	Donald Trump	I'm a politician.
0085	Donald Trump	I guess.
0086	Donald Trump	I have to say.
0087	Donald Trump	Am I a politician?
0088	Donald Trump	But I said things.
0089	Donald Trump	And we overperformed, let's put it that way.
0090	Donald Trump	We overperformed.
0091	Donald Trump	And West Virginia's very happy, and that coal is coming back and our miners are working again, folks.
0092	Donald Trump	They're working again.
0093	Donald Trump	After years of rebuilding other countries, we are finally rebuilding our country.
0094	Donald Trump	And as you know very well, because you look at your wallet, Republicans passed a massive tax cut for working families, and we will soon follow it up with another 10 percent tax cut for the middle class.
0095	Donald Trump	We've ended the war on beautiful, clean coal and we're putting our coal miners back to work.
0096	Donald Trump	That you know better than anybody.
0097	Donald Trump	Remember when my opponent in the last race went to another state about four weeks before she got to West Virginia?
0098	Donald Trump	And she was bragging, how she was going to put the coal miners out of work?
0099	Donald Trump	Remember that?
0100	Donald Trump	Remember that?
0101	Donald Trump	And I said, "You know?
0102	Donald Trump	I don't think this is going to play well in four weeks."
0103	Donald Trump	She was in a noncoal state, talking about how she was going to put the coal business out of business.
0104	Donald Trump	That didn't work.
0105	Donald Trump	It's doing great.
0106	Donald Trump	And countries are buying our coal, and Asia now, you see what's happening?
0107	Donald Trump	Asia's buying massive amounts.
0108	Donald Trump	And you're back in business, folks.
0109	Donald Trump	You're back in business.
0110	Donald Trump	You wouldn't have been in business for another 12 months.
0111	Donald Trump	You were going to be out of business in 12 months.
0112	Donald Trump	You couldn't have  you couldn't have sustained it.
0113	Donald Trump	I'm telling you, the timing was perfect.
0114	Donald Trump	Don't ever wait that long.
0115	Donald Trump	You were ready.
0116	Donald Trump	You were ready to go over the cliff.
0117	Donald Trump	That wasn't good.
0118	Donald Trump	But you're back in business.
0119	Donald Trump	Your miners are back.
0120	Donald Trump	And last year, our coal export skyrocketed by 65 percent.
0121	Donald Trump	Pretty amazing.
0122	Donald Trump	Under Republican leadership, America is booming.
0123	Donald Trump	America is thriving.
0124	Donald Trump	And America is winning.
0125	Donald Trump	Winning like never before, because we are finally putting America first.
0126	Donald Trump	It's been a long time.
0127	Donald Trump	But if Chuck Schumer  cryin' Chuck  and Nancy Pelosi... and the legendary Maxine Waters... take power, they will try to erase our gains and eradicate our progress.
0128	Donald Trump	That's what's going to happen.
0129	Donald Trump	They're going to work hard, and we will be fighting.
0130	Donald Trump	Oh, it will be  it will be ridiculous, frankly.
0131	Donald Trump	It'll be bad for our country.
0132	Donald Trump	The Democrats  and it could happen.
0133	Donald Trump	Could happen.
0134	Donald Trump	We're doing very well, and we're doing really well in the Senate.
0135	Donald Trump	But it could happen.
0136	Donald Trump	And you know what you do?
0137	Donald Trump	My whole life.
0138	Donald Trump	You know what I say?
0139	Donald Trump	Don't worry about it, I'll just figure it out.
0140	Donald Trump	Does that make sense?
0141	Donald Trump	I'll just figure it out.
0142	Donald Trump	The Democrats want to raise your taxes, restore jobkilling regulations, shut down your coal mines  and, by the way, they will shut down your coal mines.
0143	Donald Trump	You know that.
0144	Donald Trump	That's one thing I can guarantee.
0145	Donald Trump	We can talk about taxes, and I'll be here, veto, veto, veto.
0146	Donald Trump	But they ultimately want to raise your taxes very substantially.
0147	Donald Trump	But I can tell you, they will shut down your coal mines.
0148	Donald Trump	They want to take away your good health care, and essentially use socialism to turn America into Venezuela and Democrats want to totally open the borders.
0149	Donald Trump	They have the caravans, let them in.
0150	Donald Trump	Do you want to let them in?
0151	Donald Trump	Does anybody want to let them in?
0152	Donald Trump	I don't get it.
0153	Donald Trump	Think of it  you campaign on open borders and higher taxes.
0154	Donald Trump	How the hell do you win that  how do you win?
0155	Donald Trump	You're right.
0156	Donald Trump	Thank you, and we started the wall and built 1.6 billion and we have another 1.6 billion and then get another 1.6 billion.
0157	Donald Trump	I want to build it all at one time, but wait till  wait till you see  go home and see tonight what our great military is doing on the border.
0158	Donald Trump	Wait till you see.
0159	Donald Trump	Go home and enjoy it.
0160	Donald Trump	So the Democrats want to invite caravan after caravan and I don't know if you know  you see the big caravan coming in?
0161	Donald Trump	Three more are forming and you know what we give to these countries?
0162	Donald Trump	Hundreds of millions of dollars to Honduras and to El Salvador, right?
0163	Donald Trump	We have  to others we give hundreds of millions of dollars.
0164	Donald Trump	Do you know what they to give?
0165	Donald Trump	Nothing  nothing.
0166	Donald Trump	They give us nothing.
0167	Donald Trump	They give us nothing.
0168	Donald Trump	That's going to be stopping, that's going to be stopping.
0169	Donald Trump	But caravan after caravan is forming unvetted, illegal aliens trying to flood into our country on your dollar, over whelming your schools, depleting your resources, and endangering your community.
0170	Donald Trump	Homeland Security has just confirmed that members of the lawless caravan, the one you've been watching, come from 20 different countries and influet among them criminals and gang members convicted of crimes ranging from armed robbery to sexual assault.
0171	Donald Trump	And I don't know if you saw the one  they interviewed him yesterday and he was asking for pardon.
0172	Donald Trump	Didn't speak English and the nice young  I guess reporter was saying oh, (inaudible) and what was it for?
0173	Donald Trump	And essentially it was for murder who wants  and he's in the caravan.
0174	Donald Trump	This is what we have  and you look  you look at him, you look like nice, no, no murder, right?
0175	Donald Trump	You saw that, good I hope you saw that.
0176	Donald Trump	And then they gave me a hard time because I put it up on Twitter and they gave me a hard time.
0177	Donald Trump	They said you shouldn't be doing that, that's not nice.
0178	Donald Trump	And I say, all I'm doing is just telling the trust, what can I say.
0179	Donald Trump	Republicans want strong borders, no drugs, no gangs, and no caravans.
0180	Donald Trump	The choice in this election could not be more simple, a Republican Congress means more jobs and less crime.
0181	Donald Trump	A Democrat Congress means more crime and less jobs.
0182	Donald Trump	That's pretty good, that's nice and simple, doesn't get simpler than that.
0183	Donald Trump	So this Tuesday you have to go out  I know in West Virginia you tend to vote on Tuesday more so than I guess you could do the early thing, but everyone here likes to go out  me too.
0184	Donald Trump	There's something nice about its called Election Day.
0185	Donald Trump	We're all old fashioned.
0186	Donald Trump	That's why we get along.
0187	Donald Trump	That's why we get along, but you have to go out on Tuesday and vote.
0188	Donald Trump	And I'll tell you, Patrick's going to be fantastic.
0189	Donald Trump	And you know what, he'll always vote for us.
0190	Donald Trump	Not for me, for us.
0191	Donald Trump	He'll always  he's not going to be voting with Schumer or Pelosi and open borders and all the things that they want.
0192	Donald Trump	And we're honored to be joined by a friend of mine who I just mentioned before because he is one great gentlemen.
0193	Donald Trump	You know, he's a very, very successful man before he did this and he did it, and he made a mistake.
0194	Donald Trump	He ran as a Democrat.
0195	Donald Trump	And he didn't like it, and now he's a happy man and the Republican Party loves him.
0196	Donald Trump	Big Jim Justice, your governor.
0197	Donald Trump	Where is Jim?
0198	Donald Trump	Thank you, Jim.
0199	Donald Trump	Big Jim, you're doing a great job  stay there, Jim.
0200	Donald Trump	Just relax.
0201	Donald Trump	Just relax.
0202	Donald Trump	Just relax, but I'll tell you what, are you enjoying being governor, Jim?
0203	Donald Trump	The people love you.
0204	Donald Trump	65 percent up, coal exports, 65 and he works on it hard.
0205	Donald Trump	Thank you, Jim for being here.
0206	Donald Trump	Thanks for your support.
0207	Donald Trump	We love  we love our governor.
0208	Donald Trump	Thank you, Jim.
0209	Donald Trump	And another great friend of mine, somebody that has always been there, just always been there.
0210	Donald Trump	And she is a fighter.
0211	Donald Trump	She is very strong, tough but a great woman.
0212	Donald Trump	He says Melania, that's true also.
0213	Donald Trump	That's true, because surely I could say Melania too.
0214	Donald Trump	Because she's been great.
0215	Donald Trump	Great first lady, I will say that.
0216	Donald Trump	And if you think it's easy being a first lady and married to me, it's not that easy.
0217	Donald Trump	She's fantastic.
0218	Donald Trump	But Senator Shelley Moore Capito, she was  where is Shelley?
0219	Donald Trump	Thanks, Shelley.
0220	Donald Trump	Great job.
0221	Donald Trump	Really a fantastic job, I appreciate it.
0222	Donald Trump	Always there for us, always wanting to vote for West Virginia.
0223	Donald Trump	Also joining us is Tim Armstead, who is running as you know for Supreme Court.
0224	Donald Trump	A man who is highly respected and I just want to put a little word out, he's going for that extension.
0225	Donald Trump	You know what an extension is, I guess you do a good job, you're supposed to be extended.
0226	Donald Trump	And he has done so, Tim, wherever you may be  where's Tim?
0227	Donald Trump	Good luck, Tim.
0228	Donald Trump	Good luck, Tim.
0229	Donald Trump	Thank you.
0230	Donald Trump	OK?
0231	Donald Trump	And Jim specifically said you mind doing that, he's a good man, right?
0232	Donald Trump	He is a good man.
0233	Donald Trump	Thank you, good luck.
0234	Donald Trump	Do you have any opposition  any strong opposition?
0235	Donald Trump	It's not strong, it's opposition but not strong.
0236	Donald Trump	Nobody's going to beat you, Tim.
0237	Donald Trump	Not after this anyway.
0238	Donald Trump	Thank you, Tim.
0239	Donald Trump	But I'm especially proud to introduce the next person who has really become (inaudible).
0240	Donald Trump	And he's just  he is a bundle of energy.
0241	Donald Trump	He doesn't stop.
0242	Donald Trump	You know, he's tied right now.
0243	Donald Trump	They're tied in the polls, it's very close.
0244	Donald Trump	It's very close.
0245	Donald Trump	And I have to say, I like Joe.
0246	Donald Trump	The problem is I'm just not going to get Joe's vote.
0247	Donald Trump	I'm just not going to get it.
0248	Donald Trump	I like him he's a friend of mine.
0249	Donald Trump	I'm just not going to get his vote.
0250	Donald Trump	Even with Justice Kavanaugh, you know, I called Joe.
0251	Donald Trump	I said, "Joe, do me a favor.
0252	Donald Trump	I'd like you to vote."
0253	Donald Trump	He said, "well, I may.
0254	Donald Trump	I may."
0255	Donald Trump	But no, but you got to vote before I win, not after we have the vote because it was a real question because nobody has ever been treated worse that Judge Brett Kavanaugh at the time now Justice Kavanaugh.
0256	Donald Trump	Nobody, nobody.
0257	Donald Trump	Get got blindsided like nobody ever got blindsided.
0258	Donald Trump	What happened to him is disgraceful and what the Democrats did and the way they played that way a disgrace, right?
0259	Donald Trump	A disgrace.
0260	Donald Trump	And Joe said, "I'll think about it.
0261	Donald Trump	I'll think about it."
0262	Donald Trump	I said, "Joe, I don't want you to vote after we get the votes," because I didn't know we were going to have the votes without any Democrats.
0263	Donald Trump	We didn't get one Democratic vote, so I said, "Joe, I need the vote like today."
0264	Donald Trump	This was a few days before the vote.
0265	Donald Trump	Well, let me think about it.
0266	Donald Trump	Let me think about it.
0267	Donald Trump	I want to wait to do it.
0268	Donald Trump	OK, because there's nobody smoother than Joe, you understand.
0269	Donald Trump	There's nobody smoother than Joe.
0270	Donald Trump	And, no.
0271	Donald Trump	He's much smoother than Schumer actually.
0272	Donald Trump	Crying Chuck, right, right?
0273	Donald Trump	When he wants something, he cries.
0274	Donald Trump	But I've never seen him cry before, then he cried.
0275	Donald Trump	But Joe said, "all right, let me think about it.
0276	Donald Trump	Let me think about it."
0277	Donald Trump	And then it came time to vote, and as you know we got the vote.
0278	Donald Trump	And when that final vote was just coming out, Joe waited about onetenth of one second.
0279	Donald Trump	Now it means that Justice Kavanaugh was going to be Justice Kavanaugh, right?
0280	Donald Trump	We had all the votes, so we didn't need Joe's vote.
0281	Donald Trump	And he pressed that button.
0282	Donald Trump	I think it was about oneeighth of one second after we had the final vote from Susan Collins, who did us a good job, good job.
0283	Donald Trump	She did a good job.
0284	Donald Trump	Really did.
0285	Donald Trump	And it was really a tough period of time, but Joe  I said, "Joe, that doesn't count."
0286	Donald Trump	It doesn't count because if we would have needed the vote it was not going to happen.
0287	Donald Trump	Does that make any sense?
0288	Donald Trump	Do you guys understand that?
0289	Donald Trump	I said, "Joe, do it before we have the vote.
0290	Donald Trump	I think we've got the vote.
0291	Donald Trump	Do it before we have the vote."
0292	Donald Trump	And he said, "let me think.
0293	Donald Trump	Let me think."
0294	Donald Trump	And then when I spoke to him later he tried to say, "but I was watching for that oneeighth of a second.
0295	Donald Trump	I was watching."
0296	Donald Trump	But he didn't do it.
0297	Donald Trump	He didn't do it.
0298	Donald Trump	And I'll tell you what.
0299	Donald Trump	Patrick Morrisey, I built up your coal business and it's going to get a lot better by the way.
0300	Donald Trump	A lot.
0301	Donald Trump	As much as you're doing and as good as you're doing, if you look at what's happening, if you look at other countries wanting our coal  and I'll tell you, which buys a lot of coal from West Virginia.
0302	Donald Trump	Do you know that?
0303	Donald Trump	Vietnam  I was with the Prime Minister and the president.
0304	Donald Trump	You know, when you're with  well, like when you're the President of the United States I went to Vietnam, I went to various places in Asia  but where you're the president here, you're not greeted by a president.
0305	Donald Trump	You're greeted by a president and the Prime Minister.
0306	Donald Trump	They have both.
0307	Donald Trump	And they said they buy their coal now, because of me, from West Virginia.
0308	Donald Trump	Well, that's good.
0309	Donald Trump	But I  something I didn't know  I learned a lot since then.
0310	Donald Trump	That was six months ago  they said it is  they've used coal for a long time.
0311	Donald Trump	They said it's the finest coal in the world.
0312	Donald Trump	It's the finest coal in the world.
0313	Donald Trump	They have a lot of options, but they said it's the finest coal.
0314	Donald Trump	I said, "good, if I'm never like around the people, which I expect to be a lot, I will explain that."
0315	Donald Trump	But you  do you understand?
0316	Donald Trump	Do the miners know what I'm saying what I say that?
0317	Donald Trump	The finest  see, somebody like me coming from 5th Avenue.
0318	Donald Trump	What the hell do I know about that?
0319	Donald Trump	All I know is I want to put my miners back to work.
0320	Donald Trump	And I know it works.
0321	Donald Trump	And I know  and I know for national security reasons  another reason  coal is something we have to have.
0322	Donald Trump	We have to have.
0323	Donald Trump	But they said it's the finest coal in the world.
0324	Donald Trump	I thought that was great.
0325	Donald Trump	Might as well tell you.
0326	Donald Trump	Now I've told you and I don't feel guilty any longer.
0327	Donald Trump	But I just want to introduce your next United States senator from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey.
0328	Donald Trump	Patrick, come on up.
0329	Patrick Morrisey	Wow.
0330	Patrick Morrisey	Isn't this president making West Virginia great again?
0331	Patrick Morrisey	Thank you, Mr. President, for coming back again.
0332	Patrick Morrisey	I have to tell you, last night I had a debate with Senator Joe Manchin.
0333	Patrick Morrisey	And you know what he said?
0334	Patrick Morrisey	He attacked  he attacked me for supporting President Trump.
0335	Patrick Morrisey	Well I will never apologize for defending President Trump, nor will I kneel to alter of Hillary Clinton, Chuck Schumer or Nancy Pelosi.
0336	Patrick Morrisey	I ask for your vote today.
0337	Patrick Morrisey	President Trump needs a staunch ally in the U.S. Senate.
0338	Patrick Morrisey	I will be that ally.
0339	Patrick Morrisey	But I need your vote.
0340	Patrick Morrisey	I need your help.
0341	Patrick Morrisey	Go online.
0342	Patrick Morrisey	patrickmorrisey.com, volunteer, donate, help me defeat the Manchin Schumer ATM machine.
0343	Patrick Morrisey	Mr. President, thank you for everything you've done for West Virginia.
0344	Patrick Morrisey	You've been huge in our state and I look forward to winning and working with this president.
0345	Patrick Morrisey	Thank you and god bless.
0346	Donald Trump	What a good job that was.
0347	Donald Trump	So I said how's Patrick Morrisey doing to some of my friends, two people that live here, they  I said how's he doing.
0348	Donald Trump	They said he is the Energizer bunny.
0349	Donald Trump	He is all over the state.
0350	Donald Trump	You know, sometimes you'll ask that question about candidates  I won't mention names  and how're they doing  oh, they're lazy, they're not working.
0351	Donald Trump	They're not working.
0352	Donald Trump	Well they couldn't say that about me in 2016 because (inaudible).
0353	Donald Trump	Even these people say he's got a lot of energy.
0354	Donald Trump	This man has a lot of energy.
0355	Donald Trump	And just finally on Joe, I have to say that he was all for Hillary Clinton.
0356	Donald Trump	He was for Hillary Clinton.
0357	Donald Trump	She was against coal, she was against the miners, she got no support in this state, and yet Joe was totally in her camp. So that sort of  that sort of tells you  you know, Patrick  as your attorney general, Patrick 
0358	SYSTEM	[Audience chants Lock her up]
0359	Donald Trump	That's up to Patrick and he won't do that.
0360	Donald Trump	Because he's just focused on one thing, becoming your next United States senator.
0361	Donald Trump	That's what he's doing.
0362	Donald Trump	But Patrick's been tough on crime and a fierce defender of the rule of law.
0363	Donald Trump	And as your senator, he'll always be the tireless champion for the great people of this great state.
0364	Donald Trump	He loves this state.
0365	Donald Trump	And your vote on election day  thank you very much.
0366	Donald Trump	He's not my type, but I like him anyway, folks.
0367	Donald Trump	He's a rough looking guy.
0368	Donald Trump	But you're going to decide.
0369	Donald Trump	And  and everybody's watching West Virginia.
0370	Donald Trump	Because you know, this was a race  when it started I won by a lot.
0371	Donald Trump	And  and a lot of people said that this was not one that was going to happen.
0372	Donald Trump	This was a while ago, and then Patrick came along and did unbelievably in the primary.
0373	Donald Trump	He has won statewide a number of times so he's been  he's been through it but he's won statewide.
0374	Donald Trump	He knows your state as well as anybody I guess and a lot of people said well, I don't know.
0375	Donald Trump	It's almost  lets sort of focus on other states, which were also doing very well I have to say.
0376	Donald Trump	And then all the sudden we see polls and it's tied  it's in one case he's up a little bit, another case he's down a little bit but I mean its right there.
0377	Donald Trump	Let's assume it's sided.
0378	Donald Trump	It's going to be whoever gets the people going to the polls on Tuesday.
0379	Donald Trump	The whole country is watching the great state of West Virginia.
0380	Donald Trump	It's going to be a very exciting moment.
0381	Donald Trump	They asked me  the fake news media asks me recently, like a couple of days it will say, what race are you watching?
0382	Donald Trump	Oh I'm watching Florida, I'm watching all of the red, but I said watch West Virginia.
0383	Donald Trump	It's going to be very inter  and they said what?
0384	Donald Trump	I said watch West Virginia, the great place.
0385	Donald Trump	So you're going to decide, maybe, which party controls the United States Senate.
0386	Donald Trump	It's a very powerful love and a vote for Joe is a vote for Schumer.
0387	Donald Trump	It's a vote for a majority leader who will be not good and we don't want to put anti coal  these are anti coal people.
0388	Donald Trump	We are  they are anti coal people and they vote anti coal and frankly, that's what you're getting and if that's what you end up with it's your vote, not mine.
0389	Donald Trump	Remember that, remember that.
0390	Donald Trump	Joe will never be with us in terms of the vote, he'll be with us in a lot of ways.
0391	Donald Trump	We'll go to dinner with him, we'll take him out, we like him but he's never going to vote for it so I just want you to remember that, ok?
0392	Donald Trump	Ok, let's get on with it.
0393	Donald Trump	Let's get on with it, let's get on with it.
0394	Donald Trump	Patrick, I think if he ever voted against us I'll come back here, I'll say we're going to impeach him  impeach, we will impeach Patrick.
0395	Donald Trump	He'll never do it.
0396	Donald Trump	He loves the people too much.
0397	Donald Trump	He loves your industry too much.
0398	Donald Trump	He understands the state too well.
0399	Donald Trump	It's not going to happen.
0400	Donald Trump	So if you don't want the Democrat mob like you saw in the Senate, vote for Patrick.
0401	Donald Trump	Just vote for him.
0402	Donald Trump	Finally, we're thrilled to be joined by the next member of Congress, a person who you really do like a lot I have to say, and she's doing well and I thought I'd just call her up for a second.
0403	Donald Trump	Third district in West Virginia, Carol Miller, she's done a fantastic job, Carol.
0404	Carol Miller	It is terrific to be up here sharing a stage with our great President.
0405	Carol Miller	West Virginia loves President Trump.
0406	Carol Miller	President Trump, thank you for all of the support you have given my campaign.
0407	Carol Miller	I can't wait to be Congress to work with you.
0408	Carol Miller	You can always count on me to put America first, fight for coal, grow our economy, protect Social Security and Medicare, embrace our veterans, and strengthen our borders.
0409	Carol Miller	Mr. President, thank you so much for your commitment to West Virginia.
0410	Carol Miller	God bless you and God bless our country.
0411	Donald Trump	Thank you, Carol.
0412	Donald Trump	Be careful.
0413	SYSTEM	[Audience chats USA]
0414	Donald Trump	So just to tell you that Carol is great on jobs, she loves our coal miners.
0415	Donald Trump	You know that.
0416	Donald Trump	She'll always support our vets.
0417	Donald Trump	She's very strong on our vets.
0418	Donald Trump	We love our vets.
0419	Donald Trump	Our military and our law enforcement.
0420	Donald Trump	And Carol's opponent is a radical left winger named Richard Ojeda.
0421	Donald Trump	If you don't want to be saying the words Speaker Pelosi for the next two years, who will end your coal business, then you better vote for Carol Miller.
0422	Donald Trump	Thank you, Carol.
0423	Donald Trump	Thank you.
0424	Donald Trump	Thank you, Carol.
0425	Donald Trump	She's doing great.
0426	Donald Trump	If Democrats gain power, they'll also be planning a takeover of American healthcare and that would be socialism, what they want to do.
0427	Donald Trump	The Democrat plan would obliterate Medicare and eliminate Medicare Advantage for more than 121,000 West Virginia seniors who depend on it.
0428	Donald Trump	Republicans will protect Medicare for our great seniors who earned it and by the way, who paid for it.
0429	Donald Trump	Right?
0430	Donald Trump	You paid for it.
0431	Donald Trump	And Republicans will always protect patients with preexisting conditions.
0432	Donald Trump	We're all doing that.
0433	Donald Trump	I listened to President Obama speak today.
0434	Donald Trump	He had a very small crowd.
0435	Donald Trump	I have to be honest with you.
0436	Donald Trump	They don't tell you that.
0437	Donald Trump	You know?
0438	Donald Trump	They don't tell you that.
0439	Donald Trump	We had  in Houston we had the biggest thing you've ever seen and they were saying Donald Trump spoke today in front of a few thousand people.
0440	Donald Trump	Few thousand?
0441	Donald Trump	We had over 100,000 people that wanted to come.
0442	Donald Trump	We had 22,000 people in the arena.
0443	Donald Trump	We had thousands and thousands of people outside of the arena.
0444	Donald Trump	Donald Trump spoke today in front of a crowd of a few thousand people.
0445	Donald Trump	Can you believe it?
0446	Donald Trump	It's called the fake news, folks.
0447	Donald Trump	But I head President Obama speak today.
0448	Donald Trump	I had to listen  I was in the plane I had nothing else to do.
0449	Donald Trump	I heard him talk about telling the truth.
0450	Donald Trump	He was talking about you have to tell the truth.
0451	Donald Trump	And yet 28 times he said you can keep your doctor if you like your doctor.
0452	Donald Trump	You can keep your plan if you like your plan.
0453	Donald Trump	They were all lies.
0454	Donald Trump	Over and over again you heard that.
0455	Donald Trump	Just used it to pass a terrible healthcare plan that we are decimating strike by strike.
0456	Donald Trump	You saw what happened to the individual mandate, the most unpopular part.
0457	Donald Trump	And we actually had Obamacare killed except for one Republican vote and any Democrat  one Democrat and we would have had it obliterated and you would have had great healthcare.
0458	Donald Trump	But we're doing a lot to make it a lot better until we do get rid of it.
0459	Donald Trump	Then I heard him talk about the freedom of the press.
0460	Donald Trump	We have to maintain the press.
0461	Donald Trump	We have to love those people.
0462	Donald Trump	Love.
0463	Donald Trump	Except that nobody was worse to the President Obama.
0464	Donald Trump	Nobody.
0465	Donald Trump	In fact, he even used, as I remember, the Justice Department to go after reporters.
0466	Donald Trump	Remember?
0467	Donald Trump	Remember?
0468	Donald Trump	When he's talking about how I should be nice to the fake news.
0469	Donald Trump	No thank you.
0470	Donald Trump	And let's not forget President Obama's false promises about our trade deals.
0471	Donald Trump	Just one.
0472	Donald Trump	His administration promised that with South Korea we would create in a trade deal 70,000 jobs.
0473	Donald Trump	But instead of that, it killed over 100,000 jobs in our country.
0474	Donald Trump	It was a horrible deal, which by the way, I have totally renegotiated and made it a good deal.
0475	Donald Trump	Lie after lie, broken promise after broken promise, that's what he did.
0476	Donald Trump	Unlike President Obama, we live by a different moto.
0477	Donald Trump	It's called promises made, promises kept.
0478	Donald Trump	And we've done more than we ever said we would.
0479	Donald Trump	We said we were going to do things and we've done a lot more and they will be the first to tell you tell.
0480	Donald Trump	Democrats' plan  that's right, the magic wand, right?
0481	Donald Trump	Remember, he said you need a magic wand to produce manufacturing jobs.
0482	Donald Trump	Well, we just hit almost 600,000.
0483	Donald Trump	Democrats' plan to destroy healthcare, also includes raiding Medicare to fund benefits for illegal immigrants.
0484	Donald Trump	I'm sure you don't mind that.
0485	Donald Trump	As we speak, Democrats are openly encouraging millions of illegal aliens to violate our laws and to over run our borders.
0486	Donald Trump	They want to sign illegal aliens up for free healthcare, free welfare, free education and the right to vote.
0487	Donald Trump	Otherwise, they don't get much.
0488	Donald Trump	Illegal immigration cost American tax payers more than $100 billion every single year, more than 20 times the entire state budget of the sate of West Virginia.
0489	Donald Trump	We need to use our precious resources to help low income Americans who respect our laws, not caravans who break in to our country and break our laws.
0490	Donald Trump	We don't want that.
0491	Donald Trump	We don't want that, I'm sorry.
0492	Donald Trump	Now, we don't mind if they come in, but they have to come in legally.
0493	Donald Trump	Democrat immigration policies not only drain our treasury, but they threaten our communities.
0494	Donald Trump	Nearly 100 percent of heroin in the United States enters though the southern border, along with roughly 90 percent of cocaine, the majority of meth and a substantial portion of the ultra lethal fentanyl killing a youth drug, fentanyl  the worst.
0495	Donald Trump	These drugs kill more than 70,000 Americans every single year.
0496	Donald Trump	Last year alone, our brave ICE officers who they want to get rid of by the way, these are tough, great, strong patriots.
0497	Donald Trump	We need strength, arrested more than 127,000.
0498	Donald Trump	Think of that, 127,000 Aliens With criminal records, including those charged or convicted of 48,000 assaults, 12,000 sex crimes and 1,800 homicides.
0499	Donald Trump	They want to get rid of them, let's get rid of ICE.
0500	Donald Trump	What are these people thinking?
0501	Donald Trump	That's why you have to have Patrick Morrisey and Carol.
0502	Donald Trump	You have to vote them in on Tuesday.
0503	Donald Trump	You have to do it.
0504	Donald Trump	Yet Democrats want to abolish ICE, they want to turn America in to a giant sanctuary for criminal aliens, drug dealers and MS13 killers.
0505	Donald Trump	And by the way, we remove thousands over the last little bit less than two years that I've been here.
0506	Donald Trump	Thousands and thousands of MS13 gang members have been thrown the hell out of the country.
0507	Donald Trump	A blue wave equals a crime wave  you don't hear too much about the blue wave anymore though, do you?
0508	Donald Trump	Remember a couple of months  oh, the blue wave, oh the blue wave.
0509	Donald Trump	Now they don't talk  you know, I'm not saying they don't squeak it by, maybe because they got of races and I can't go everywhere.
0510	Donald Trump	Can't go everywhere.
0511	Donald Trump	But now they're talking about (inaudible).
0512	Donald Trump	I mean, you know let's see what happens.
0513	Donald Trump	Going t be an interesting day at the office.
0514	Donald Trump	You remember that election two years ago?
0515	Donald Trump	There were a lot of really happy people that night, but there were some that were slightly  not too happy.
0516	Donald Trump	Cry, baby, cry.
0517	Donald Trump	A red wave equals jobs and safety.
0518	Donald Trump	Republicans believe our country should be a sanctuary for lawabiding Americans, not criminal aliens.
0519	Donald Trump	And Republicans will always stand with the heroes of ICE, border patrol and our great law enforcement.
0520	Donald Trump	You have great law enforcement right here... in West Virginia.
0521	Donald Trump	I look at those people  I'm looking at your law enforcement right there.
0522	Donald Trump	I feel very safe.
0523	Donald Trump	Thank you, fellas.
0524	Donald Trump	Thank you.
0525	Donald Trump	Thank you.
0526	Donald Trump	Thank you, fellas.
0527	Donald Trump	And, yes, the wall is happening.
0528	Donald Trump	It should happen immediately.
0529	Donald Trump	It's moving beautifully.
0530	Donald Trump	The design is beautiful, and it's happening.
0531	Donald Trump	And some communities in California, of all places, down to miss San Diego, we're just about finishing it up.
0532	Donald Trump	But they're demanding the wall.
0533	Donald Trump	They want the wall.
0534	Donald Trump	I said, "Let's not give it to them because then they'll put pressure on their government to build it," right?
0535	Donald Trump	Now once we build it for them, they'll say, "We shouldn't have a wall."
0536	Donald Trump	But they already have their wall.
0537	Donald Trump	That's the way it works, folks.
0538	Donald Trump	Border security is also a woman's issue.
0539	Donald Trump	You know, they keep talking about women.
0540	Donald Trump	Trump with women.
0541	Donald Trump	Remember the last election?
0542	Donald Trump	Well, Donald Trump won't do very well with women.
0543	Donald Trump	I did great with women.
0544	Donald Trump	Look at the (inaudible).
0545	Donald Trump	I did great.
0546	Donald Trump	Right?
0547	Donald Trump	I did great with women.
0548	Donald Trump	In fact, at the end, when I won, they  they said, "You know, a statistic we got wrong, women really came out for Trump."
0549	Donald Trump	I said, "Thank you.
0550	Donald Trump	Thank you."
0551	Donald Trump	Same thing now.
0552	Donald Trump	Because women want safe neighborhoods for their families, right?
0553	Donald Trump	They want great schools, health care for their children.
0554	Donald Trump	They want to keep drug dealers and predators and traffickers  how about the traffickers?
0555	Donald Trump	These are human traffickers.
0556	Donald Trump	These are the worst scum in the world.
0557	Donald Trump	They want them out of our country.
0558	Donald Trump	And we do that.
0559	Donald Trump	The Democrats don't do that.
0560	Donald Trump	They want the open borders.
0561	Donald Trump	Fly right in, folks.
0562	Donald Trump	Come on in.
0563	Donald Trump	We don't care who the hell you are, come on in.
0564	Donald Trump	Think of it, 300 people.
0565	Donald Trump	You know, we're getting a lot of heat because, I was saying, there were some bad people in that caravan.
0566	Donald Trump	Right?
0567	Donald Trump	So we checked, 300 people.
0568	Donald Trump	I read them out to you.
0569	Donald Trump	That is one more reason why women all across the nation are going to show up and vote Republican on Tuesday.
0570	Donald Trump	They want security.
0571	Donald Trump	They want safety.
0572	Donald Trump	They don't want to have these people coming in.
0573	Donald Trump	They don't want to have  some of these people are just horrible people.
0574	Donald Trump	You have to see the crimes they've committed.
0575	Donald Trump	This election is about security, and it's about prosperity.
0576	Donald Trump	For years, you watched as we let foreign countries plunder our wealth and shutter our factories and steal our jobs.
0577	Donald Trump	And you watched helplessly.
0578	Donald Trump	We don't watch helplessly any more.
0579	Donald Trump	Those days are over.
0580	Donald Trump	We've added half a million manufacturing jobs  soon to be 600,000  since the election, including 32,000 in just the last month.
0581	Donald Trump	These were jobs that the previous administration said would never happen.
0582	Donald Trump	And these are great jobs.
0583	Donald Trump	These are among our greatest jobs.
0584	Donald Trump	Manufacturing jobs.
0585	Donald Trump	And thanks to our tariffs that we put on steel that was coming in, and they were dumping it all over the place and destroying our steel companies and our aluminum industry.
0586	Donald Trump	Roaring back.
0587	Donald Trump	Steel industry is roaring back.
0588	Donald Trump	And for the miners, by the way, in Minnesota and other places, we're grabbing that iron ore and they're making steel.
0589	Donald Trump	And the hottest industry  one of the hottest industries now, look at what's happened to steel.
0590	Donald Trump	Steel, like coal, it was going off the cliff.
0591	Donald Trump	You weren't going to have a steel industry in this country and we need it.
0592	Donald Trump	Certain industries you need, you need steel.
0593	Donald Trump	You don't have steel  you need it for defense.
0594	Donald Trump	What are we going to go incase we're  hopefully we'll never have a problem, ok.
0595	Donald Trump	I made the military  it'll be stronger than it ever was before ever and that's why you won't have a problem.
0596	Donald Trump	You know, if you don't want to have a problem, make your military much stronger than anybody else ever thought possible, but we need steel.
0597	Donald Trump	How about this?
0598	Donald Trump	We don't have any  so see our steel bills were finished.
0599	Donald Trump	We were going down  you guys understand that, but we were going down.
0600	Donald Trump	Now it's so hot, but you need steel.
0601	Donald Trump	There are certain industries you have to have  you need defense.
0602	Donald Trump	You don't have it  you have purpose, what are we gonna do?
0603	Donald Trump	We have a conflict and we call China?
0604	Donald Trump	We need more steel.
0605	Donald Trump	Please, please, could we have some more steel?
0606	Donald Trump	It's ridiculous.
0607	Donald Trump	Our steel industry is roaring back and we're putting billions of dollars in our treasury because we're charging 25 percent tax on those people that dump their steel.
0608	Donald Trump	They dump is all over the place in order to destroy our steel industry and the miner are coming back, in this case, since the iron ore and it's coming out and it's gonna  it's a beautiful thing to see.
0609	Donald Trump	I mean we've rebuilt  we really started that about eight months ago, really heavy started it.
0610	Donald Trump	I wanted to get my feet a little bit wet as President, right.
0611	Donald Trump	We started it about eight months ago.
0612	Donald Trump	It's incredible.
0613	Donald Trump	The head of U.S. Steel called up, he said I've never said anything like it  what you've been able to do in such a short period of time.
0614	Donald Trump	They're building seven new plants, they're expanding plants.
0615	Donald Trump	Nucor  Nucor, a big steel company is building brand new plants $750 million, $900 million brand new plants.
0616	Donald Trump	It's incredible.
0617	Donald Trump	They haven't been built in years.
0618	Donald Trump	Last month, I announced that we're replacing the horrible NAFTA deal, one of the worst  stupidest deals ever made with an incredible brand new U.S. Mexico Canada agreement.
0619	Donald Trump	We've taken the toughest ever action to crack down on China's abusive trade practices and we're doing very nicely.
0620	Donald Trump	We'll probably make a deal.
0621	Donald Trump	They want to make a deal.
0622	Donald Trump	America is being respected again.
0623	Donald Trump	We're respected as a country again.
0624	Donald Trump	We were not respected for a long time.
0625	Donald Trump	We were laughed at just like these stupid immigration laws.
0626	Donald Trump	The whole world looks at it, they laugh, they said what is this all about?
0627	Donald Trump	A person comes into our country  another country throws them out.
0628	Donald Trump	Hey, get out.
0629	Donald Trump	You're not supposed to be here, you have to go through a process.
0630	Donald Trump	You know what we do?
0631	Donald Trump	We take them  we can't do anything  we bring them through a court proceeding.
0632	Donald Trump	We take a person who walks onto our property we have a big deal  a court case.
0633	Donald Trump	They have lawyers, we have lawyers and what happens is then they go away and is supposed to come back for the trial.
0634	Donald Trump	Could be two years, three years later and they disappear into the country never to be seen again.
0635	Donald Trump	There's no trial, very few people come back  almost none.
0636	Donald Trump	This is the procedure.
0637	Donald Trump	This is the law.
0638	Donald Trump	This is crazy.
0639	Donald Trump	And the Democrats don't want to change it because they know its chaos and a disaster and they think that's good, but I think it's good for us because I think they overplayed their hand.
0640	Donald Trump	And how these caravans were formed, you'll have to figure that out.
0641	Donald Trump	But they overplayed their hand too, assuming they had something to do with it but it was very well organized, amazingly, in Honduras and the different places very well.
0642	Donald Trump	And you know they came up and I'll tell you people are really energized.
0643	Donald Trump	They're energized about that, they're energized about the way justice, as you know Kavanaugh.
0644	Donald Trump	Just as Kavanaugh was treated, they're energized when they saw the way he was  Brett Kavanaugh  when they saw the way he was treated, they're energized about a lot of things.
0645	Donald Trump	They want to see us be a great, respected country.
0646	Donald Trump	And that's what's happening.
0647	Donald Trump	We have taken bold action to reduce the price of prescription drugs to help critically ill patients get life saving treatments.
0648	Donald Trump	We passed something that they've been trying to pass for many, many years.
0649	Donald Trump	It's called right to try where you can try stuff.
0650	Donald Trump	That isn't out yet, but it's looking promising.
0651	Donald Trump	That's such an important thing.
0652	Donald Trump	They've been trying to pass that for decades.
0653	Donald Trump	I got it done.
0654	Donald Trump	After years of surging premiums, the cost of healthcare is finally coming down.
0655	Donald Trump	We're getting the cost of healthcare down.
0656	Donald Trump	And last month, I proudly signed the largest bill to fight the opioid epidemic.
0657	Donald Trump	It's the largest bill in American history.
0658	Donald Trump	We passed Veterans Choice, giving our veterans the right to see a private doctor.
0659	Donald Trump	And the landmark VA accountability law to ensure anyone who mistreat our veterans will be held accountable.
0660	Donald Trump	You are fired.
0661	Donald Trump	Get out.
0662	Donald Trump	We secured $700 billion and $716 billion to fully rebuild the United States military.
0663	Donald Trump	And we gave our great warriors, I know you have some of them right here.
