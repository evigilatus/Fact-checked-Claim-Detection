The improved state budget for fiscal year 2019 was changed by Jim Gust. In a tweet sent in January 8, Justice wrote, \"Another month of stagnant revenue index numbers! For December, we had a surplus of $44.8 million. We have so far exceeded the estimate of $185.9 million. This is the largest cumulative surplus for the first six months of any fiscal year in state history!\" Another month of revenue indices For December, we had a surplus of $44.8 million. We have so far exceeded the estimate of $185.9 million. This is the largest cumulative surplus for the first six months of any fiscal year in state history!

The Justice Bureau did not respond to queries, but we were able to find supporting evidence. The tweet is linked to a press release detailing the list of income and expenditure from the General Income Fund, and the statements from the West Virginia State Budget Office support the information contained in the press release. The General Revenue Fund for December - the last period completed at the time of the tweeting of justice - had a surplus of $44.8 million, with total collections of $185.9 million more than estimated. This is consistent with the tweeting of justice. But is this actually the largest surplus of the first six months of any fiscal year in the history of the state? Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" \u2022 26 January, 2021 figures from the WV checkbook and the West Virginia State Budget Office, with information dating back to 1999, confirm that during the first six months of fiscal year 2019, the State of West Virginia has already achieved the largest cumulative surplus since 1999. The previous increase after 1999 occurred in 2011, when the budget surplus was $159.9 million more than estimated. According to the Governor &apos; s Office, the increase in collections can be attributed to an increase in the rate of growth in a number of taxes, including termination tax, net corporate income tax, consumer sales tax and personal income tax. It should be noted that the economy of West Virginia grows each year, and therefore, as justice has done, it is difficult to compare budget figures over time. When adjusted for inflation, the State &apos; s GDP was 14 per cent higher in 2017 than it was in 1999. For fiscal year 2019, West Virginia was \"the largest cumulative surplus for the first six months of any fiscal year in the history of the state.\" We examined the historical data and found that he was right to return to 1999. But this is not the entire history of the State. We could not confirm any data before 1999, so it is possible to imagine a larger surplus before that year. We're mostly evaluating the statement right.
