That\u2019s not how vaccines work. Vaccines give you an inactive form of the bug to allow your immune system to create antibodies.\" (You can read more about how vaccines do work here.)\nSeveral other fact-checkers have also investigated whether a flu shot can result in false positives for COVID-19, and all came to the same conclusion: no.\u00a0\nDr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children\u2019s Hospital in Philadelphia, told FactCheck.org that there\u2019s no cross reaction between influenza and the new coronavirus, meaning flu traces wouldn\u2019t cause someone to test positive for COVID-19.\nA spokesperson for the Food and Drug Administration also told FactCheck.org that all FDA-approved COVID-19 tests are checked for cross-reactivity with influenza virus and influenza antibodies and so far, no cross-reactivity has occurred.\nWe rate this Facebook post Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18357"}
