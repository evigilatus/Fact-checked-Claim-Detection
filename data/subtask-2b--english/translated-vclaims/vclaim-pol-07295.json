On September 8, a television announcement was made, and the post was filled with its record of overseeing the elimination of the prevalence of prescription drug abuse allowed by Florida doctors. \"With our application of the amazing law, we shut down the pill mill,\" said Bondi. \"From the top 100 Oxycodone doctors in this country, 98 of them lived in Florida. Today, there's nothing.\" This stat means that Bondi was hard on crime, but Polly Fuck Florida wanted to know if it was accurate. The cereal mill epidemic was a nationwide problem in 2010, led by doctors who write prescriptions and sell medicines from their own clinics. Florida's soft laws gave the sunshine state a reputation for easy access to medicine, so that billboards were announced to Narco tourists -- extrastate buyers who would come to Florida to buy medicine. With over 1,000 pain clinics all over the state, Florida became known as Oxy Express. Pondi, who was elected in 2010, was a strong supporter of HB 7095, the 2011 law which increased penalties for doctors who abuse prescription privileges, prevented them from describing drugs such as oxycodone, and strengthened the State &apos; s regulatory authority to traffic prescription pills. The bill was passed unanimously by both houses of the legislature on 6 May 2011 and signed by the Government. Rick Scott on June 3, 2011. The Bondi Politi Fact Florida camp reported that the data in the commercial declaration came from the State-wide Task Force on the Description of Drug Abuse and Neonatality, the 2014 progress report, which specifically addressed the effects of opioid use on their children by pregnant women. The report appreciates the changes in the Florida Act that have closed several clinics. \"In 2010, 98 of the top 100 oxycodone pills distributed by doctors nationwide stayed in Florida,\" read the report. \"In 2011, after HB 7095, only 13 of the top 100 residents of Florida, and by the end of 2012, no Florida doctor appeared at the top of the 100 list.\" The report, which also used figures widely disseminated by the media, referred to the data of the United States Drug Enforcement Administration, which had been consulted in January 2013. The Bondi office also gave us a press release from the DEA on April 5, 2013, to support this allegation -- although this statement said \"90 of the top 100 doctors buying oxycodone in the country are located in Florida. On January 12, 2021, he wrote in an Instagram article saying that Joe Biden remained silent about the violence in Black Lives-Mite protests. \u2022 January 16, 2012, when we asked the Prosecutor's Office why there was a discrepancy in numbers, they insisted that the number was 98. However, the DEA has remained stable: in 2010, 90 of the top 100 Oxycodone purchase doctors. The federal agency also told us that the number of doctors in Florida in 2011, after HB 7095, fell to 10, not 13. But wait, the Bondi Declaration says \"Oxycodone Clinicians,\" not \"Buy,\" as measured by the DEA in 2010. Because the 2011 law no longer allows doctors to buy medicine simply to resell it, Mia Roo, the Public Information Officer of the Anti-Narcotics Department of Paulette Fact Florida, said. \"When the Florida Act was changed, doctors were prevented from distributing contraceptive pills from their clinics,\" said Ro. She said that the Agency did not follow \"what was filled or described.\" This means that the DEA figures were not tracking whether or not there was actual abuse, but that doctors in Florida were buying a lot of oxycodone. Some doctors are still allowed to buy hydrocodone in large quantities, as Roe said -- emergency room staff, for example -- but private doctors can no longer buy and sell medicine themselves. There was one unnamed DEA record from Florida, which was in the top 100 Oxycodone buyers in 2014, said Roe: a buyer of a fleet of cruise ships, to use medicine in the sick bays of the fleet. This does not mean that the grain mill was not a problem, or that the 2011 law made no difference. At the time of the enactment of Act No. 7095, 11 people were estimated to die daily from prescription drug use. From 2010 to 2012, the overdose mortality rate for prescription drugs, illicit drugs and alcohol decreased by approximately 17 per cent, and the total mortality from prescription drugs decreased by 23 per cent, according to a report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About 52 per cent of this decline in deaths was from oxycodone. The governor, Bondi, said that out of the top 100 Oxycodone doctors, 98 were in Florida, and \"Today there's no one.\" According to the figures of the DEA, since 2010, the number of doctors who have distributed the most oxycodone in the country and also live in Florida has decreased from 98 to the highest 100. The DEA told us there were some problems with this. First, it was for the largest buyers of oxycodone, not distributors -- the DEA said the list didn't follow the exemption. Second, in 2010, the number was 90 and not 98, although the State and the media have widely disseminated figure 98 in the past few years. Third, in 2014 there was one of the 100 largest buyers of Oxycodone in Florida, a buyer of a cruise ship fleet. The DEA's data are tracked only by the main buyers, not whether the actual use of drugs has decreased, but other sources have confirmed that the use of oxycodone in a downward direction in the State, although there is controversy as to whether the 2011 Bundy Act supported is the only factor. While the details are somewhat unclear, the essence and context of what Bondi says is accurate: there are no more doctors in Florida's contraceptive mill in the top 100 anti-drug units. We're mostly evaluating the statement right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07295"}
