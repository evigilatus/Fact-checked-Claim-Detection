The draft laws - so-called identical bills - generally provide language for the implementation of how the legislature wants to spend money in the budget. However, the leaders of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate have also resorted to two substantive bills to remove regulations on several professions, including internal designers. Moreover, senators had only hours to read the bills -- 43 of them -- and then voted. So, the senators put their collective feet down. A bill to free internal designers died in the Senate 32-6. Another bill that matches Matt's 21-18. Jacques Latvala, who had previously served in the Senate in 1994-2002 and was elected again in 2010, took the floor early in the morning of 7 May to denounce the entire process. \"I don't really want you to get winners and losers. I think the winners and losers, which is how they interpret them, are the people of Florida, \"He said Latvala. \"There is one lesson I hope we will learn. When I left the Florida Senate in 2002, the bill (corresponding) was 11 or 12 pages. The number of pages of the bill implemented in 2008 was 400. I mean, matching bills. The number of pages in matching invoices this year is also Altman -- 2200. \"In three years, pages in matching bills have risen from 400 pages to 2200,\" he said. Then Latvala, speaking directly to Senate President Mike Harridopolous, said: \"May God show us your leadership that we can turn the clock back that way when we have the night of the closing of our meeting next year.\" Latvala's numbers -- courtesy of Altman -- may look amazing. But they're almost right. The leaders of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate proposed 43 bills in line with the budget of approximately 500 pages. We've calculated the pages of each bill. A government reorganization bill, SB 2156, was so large that we couldn't download it on our computer in the Adobe Acrobat version. We had to open a different version of the bill to see that it contained 20,990 lines of text -- which would translate into about 740 pages; * a development management bill, HB 7207, size 349 pages of college; * the smallest matching bill was just two pages. I've removed the cybercrime unit in the D.A.'s office. In total, there were 2,170 pages of matching invoices (the exact number may vary slightly based on the exact number of pages in the Government reorganization bill). Compared to 2008, there were 29 identical bills and a total of 499 pages. We've built a schedule so you can see the difference between the years for yourself. Lavala said that from 2008 to 2001, \"the pages in the matching invoices have risen from 400 pages to 2200.\" We're assessing this claim right. Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" \u2022 January 26, 2012", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13132"}
