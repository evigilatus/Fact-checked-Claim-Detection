A subsequent Pew study pegged the number working in farming and related sectors slightly higher, at 4 percent.\n\nSteven A. Camarota, director of research for the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors stricter immigration laws, said it\u2019s possible that during peak harvesting times, as many as 5 percent of the U.S. illegal immigrant population is working in agriculture. But in general, the statistics involving illegal immigrants are, not surprisingly, tricky to pin down. So we think that saying that \"less than 2 percent of illegals are picking crops\" is reasonably accurate.\n\n\"41 percent (of illegal immigrants) are on welfare\"\n\nThis half of the statement is more problematic.\n\nThe most detailed statistics we found were from Camarota\u2019s group. In a 2007 report, the center published a table titled, \"Welfare Use for Illegal Alien-Headed Households.\" The table reported that 40 percent of illegal immigrant-headed households used any \"major welfare\" program in the previous calendar year. The percentage was even higher in illegal-immigrant headed households that included children: a whopping 71 percent, according to a a 2011 report by the center.\n\nSo there is some basis for the 40 percent figure. However, it\u2019s important to keep two bits of context in mind:\n\n\u2022 This statistic addresses households headed by an illegal immigrant. However, many of these households include American citizens within the family, often children who were born in the United States and who received citizenship at birth. Indeed, given the web of restrictions on the granting of government benefits to illegal immigrants, most of the \"welfare\" benefits being counted in the CIS table are going to citizen children, not to adult illegal immigrants. Indeed, the government is responsible for checking the immigration status of people receiving benefits.\n\nIt\u2019s true that some types of benefits, such as food stamps, can be shared among all members of a family. An illegal immigrant, for instance, may end up eating food bought with a citizen relative\u2019s food stamps. Still, the Facebook post\u2019s phrasing -- that 41 percent of illegal immigrants are on welfare -- is misleading because it ignores that the benefits in question are generally going to American citizens.\n\n\u2022 We suspect that when many people hear the term \"welfare,\" they think of cash benefits. However, very little cash assistance is going to illegal immigrants. According to CIS, less than 1 percent of illegal-immigrant-headed households included anyone receiving direct government cash assistance, such as Temporary Aid for Needy Families (TANF), Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or state-run cash aid. This is not surprising: Illegal immigrants are generally barred from receiving such payments.\n\nInstead, the kind of \"welfare\" these households received were primarily one of two types: health care or food.\n\nIn all, 27 percent of such households received coverage from Medicaid, the federal-state health care program for the poor, while 33 percent received food assistance, such as free or reduced-price school lunches, food stamps, or benefits from the Women-Infants-Children program (WIC). As noted earlier, many of the recipients of these programs were actually citizen children of illegal immigrants. Few illegal immigrants received housing benefits, the other major category of assistance from the government, CIS found.\n\nMedicaid and food assistance certainly qualify as government benefits, and they cost the taxpayers money. But it\u2019s less clear that they fit the commonly understood definition of \"welfare.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nThe Facebook post\u2019s first claim, that \"less than 2 percent of illegals are picking crops,\" is close to correct. The post\u2019s second claim, that \"41 percent (of illegal immigrants) are on welfare\" is misleading. Most of the \"welfare\" benefits in question are going to U.S. citizens who live in illegal immigrant households, not directly to illegal immigrants, and very little of it comes in cash form, which is the traditional definition of \"welfare.\" On balance, we rate the claim Mostly False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.
