Chris Christie arrives and straightens the place up in the 30-second spot released by Committee for Our Children\u2019s Future, a nonprofit group that supports the governor.\n\n\"For years, politicians have run amok in Trenton and cleaning up their mess hasn't been easy, but [with] Gov. Chris Christie and bipartisan reformers: the most job growth in 11 years, millions in new education funding, two budgets balanced,\" the narrator says in the ad released Jan. 25. \"Christie and reformers are working to strengthen our economy, improve education and cut income taxes for all New Jersey families. Join our reform movement, because cleaning up is never easy, but it's worth it.\"\n\nPolitiFact New Jersey has addressed two of these claims previously: the governor increased education funding this year and he\u2019s balanced two budgets, as he\u2019s required to do.\n\nNow, we\u2019re checking the claim that with Christie and bipartisan reformers, New Jersey had the \"most job growth in 11 years.\"\n\nBrian Jones, a spokesman for Committee for Our Children\u2019s Future, first sent us a Jan. 15 Asbury Park Press article to support the claim. It states that job growth last year \"put the state on pace for its best year since 2000, when it added 77,100 jobs.\"\n\nBut PolitiFact New Jersey\u2019s analysis of the most recent state data, which is still subject to revision, doesn\u2019t support that conclusion.\n\nLet\u2019s look at job growth in the Garden State.\n\nIn 2011, New Jersey gained 39,400 private-sector jobs and lost 3,000 government jobs. The net gain, then, was 36,400 jobs.\n\nIn 2004, the state added 37,700 jobs of which 14,700 were from the public sector\n\nPrior to that, New Jersey had the most job growth in 2000, with an overall increase of 77,100 jobs.\n\nSo, last year New Jersey had the highest total employment growth in seven years.\n\nWhen we reached back out to Jones, he said the statement in the ad was referring to private-sector employment, which grew more last year than in 11 years.\n\n\"There\u2019s been bloated government in Trenton for too long. Governor Christie\u2019s policies are working to trim the fat, while growing private-sector jobs,\" he said.\n\nJoseph Seneca, a professor at the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, said it\u2019s more appropriate to compare private-sector job growth now.\n\nIn 2011, the state was purposefully \"trying to reduce public-sector employment and the public sector in general,\" he said. \"Whereas in 2004 it was sort of the Wild West, 40 percent of the total growth that year was in the public sector.\"\n\nAs we\u2019ve noted in previous rulings, it\u2019s generally wrong to assign full credit or blame for job growth or job losses to specific individuals. While the governor and bipartisan reformers may have had a hand in creating more jobs other factors are at work, including the nation\u2019s recovery \u00a0from a job-destroying recession.\n\nOur ruling\n\nA group that supports the governor \u00a0released a video ad that said with Christie and bipartisan reformers, New Jersey had \"the most job growth in 11 years.\"\n\nThe state gained more jobs overall last year than in seven years -- not 11 years. In 2004, the state added 37,700 jobs. In 2011, we added 36,400 jobs.\n\nPublic-sector growth boosted job gains in 2004, while last year the state added jobs despite a decrease in government employment\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 .\n\nThe ad doesn\u2019t make a distinction in the types of jobs gained, but a spokesman said it was referring to private-sector employment. Last year, New Jersey had the most private-sector job growth in 11 years.\n\nOverall, we rate this statement Half True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Boysko\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in a committee debate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe United States is the only industrialized, modernized country that does not already have a paid family medical leave program in place.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11687"}
