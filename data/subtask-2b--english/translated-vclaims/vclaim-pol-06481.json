This is the question posed in Clinton Cash's forthcoming book by the author and political adviser Peter Schweizer. In Sunday presentations, Schweizer said that while his research did not reveal any evidence of a trade between foreign interests and the Democratic Racer in 2016, the evidence indicated an alarming trend. In an interview on April 26 in the Fox News on Sunday, guest Chris Wallace highlighted a claim from Schweizer's book. \"You have an interesting point that I want to put on the screen that seems to indicate exactly the point you're doing,\" said Wallace. Between 2001 and 2012, Bill Clinton delivered 13 speeches, 13 speeches, paid $500,000 or more. Eleven of the 13 letters were at least eight years after he left the presidency while his wife was Secretary of State. Schweiser responded, noting that Bill Clinton's \"dramatically\" speaking fees had risen when Hillary Clinton, now a presidential candidate, took office in 2009. \"When you have one or two examples, it's a coincidence,\" he said. \"When you have this number, for me it's a trend.\" We're not going to go into the health of Schweizer's general thesis here. But we are interested in Bill Clinton's speech fee while Hillary Clinton was in the State Department. His books say \"of the 13 Clinton letters that brought in $500,000 or more, only two occurred during the years when his wife was not the Secretary of State,\" according to The New York Times, which has an advance version. In 2014, before Clinton Cash became public, the Washington Post analysed Clinton &apos; s speaking fees and found that he had received at least $104 million in speaking fees between 2001 and 2012 -- more than half of this income comes from speeches in foreign countries (although he made more speeches within the United States). In order to learn more about Clinton's speaking fees, we have moved to the federal financial disclosure forms developed by Hillary Clinton, which were made available by the Centre for Responsive Policy, a research team that tracks funds in politics. Since Hillary Clinton held federal positions from her departure from the White House in 2001 until 2012, her financial information as well as that of Bill Clinton are available for all those years. Schweizer did not respond to our requests for comments, but the income information in the financial disclosure forms supports his claim. This is a list of all speeches for which Clinton received fees of $500,000 or more, including year, location, host and actual fees: 2003 - Japan, $500,000 Sakura Asset Management (Japan Finance Corporation) (note: cancelled, but fees went to the Clinton Presidential Library Foundation); 2008 - California, $500,000, Internal Energy (Commercial Mark of Life Coach Anthony Robbins); 2010 - Russia, $500,000, Renaissance Capital (Russian Finance Corporation); 2010 - United Arab Emirates, $500,000, Novo Nordisk (Danish Medicines Company); 2011 - Nigeria, $700,000, THERDAY (newspaper); and verification of the false facts cited by Greg Kelly on 11 January 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on the video \"Exultion\" in \"Acession.\" By Bill McCarthy: 12 January 2021 2011 - Austria, $500,000, Center for Global Dialogue and Cooperation (an Austrian NGO); 2011 - Netherlands, $600,000, Ashmia (a Dutch finance company); 2011 - China, $550,000, Huato Senior Executives Forum (a trade conference); 2011 - United Arab Emirates, $500,000, Abu Dhabi Global Environmental Data Initiative (an international environmental information organization); 2011 - Hong Kong, $750,000, Eriksson (a Swedish multinational telecommunications technology company); 2012 - Nigeria, $700,000, THEDAY (a newspaper); 2012 - Austria, $500,000, Center for Global Dialogue and Cooperation (an Austrian non-governmental organization); 2012 - Italy, $500,000, Technogem (value manufacturer). So at the time Clinton left the White House in January 2001 and when his wife withdrew from the Foreign Minister in February 2013, Clinton had already delivered 13 speeches for which he had submitted more than $500,000. Eleven of these cases have occurred since January 2009, when Hillary Clinton became Secretary of State. Only two happened before then. Schweiser indicates that Clinton's speaking fees increased in 2009 partly because companies wanted leverage within the Hillary Clinton Foreign Office. For example, New York Times reporters -- based on Shaweiser's work -- found that while the State Department was involved in securing a uranium mining deal with Russia, investors in the company involved in the deal, uranium One, gave millions to the Clinton Foundation. In addition, \" Shortly after the Russians announced their intention to obtain the majority share of U1 uranium, Mr. Clinton received $500,000 for the Moscow letter from a Russian investment bank with links to the Kremlin that was promoting uranium 1 stockpiles.\" The article speaks of speech No. 1: 1. 3 on the list above, the 2010 speech paid for by the capital of the Renaissance. ABC News also examined Clinton &apos; s talking records and found numerous cases where funds were taken from interest groups pending in the Foreign Ministry. Ethics officials in the Department of State had to sign these speeches, but they rarely said that Clinton could not afford to pay for a particular speech. The presidential campaign launched by Hillary Clinton strongly denied that there was some trade between entities that contributed to Clinton &apos; s wealth, on the grounds that Schweiser &apos; s book did not contain compelling evidence of any such transaction. \"From the 13 letters of Clinton (Bill) that brought in $500,000 or more, only two occurred during the years in which his wife was not the Secretary of State.\" We're not checking Shaweiser's suggestion that the increase in speaking fees was part of a plan for the wife in the State Department. But on the exact numbers, Schweitzer is correct. The financial disclosure forms submitted by Hillary Clinton from 2001 to the end of 2012 confirm Schweizer &apos; s claim. We're assessing it right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06481"}
