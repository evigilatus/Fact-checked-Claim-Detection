And I give people like John McCain and others credit, because they\u2019re saying that. But the fact that Donald Trump acts like nothing happened, makes me even more suspicious of how much he knows and when he knew about it.\nFreyberg: What about other people across the aisle, your peers, are they taking this as seriously as you are?\nPocan: More and more are, as more of this information comes out. So, I think at first, they also were told, Oh, there\u2019s nothing here to look at, nothing here to look at.
