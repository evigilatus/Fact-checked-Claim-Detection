Sexuality and immigration services. Williams said he was frustrated when he heard that people described the situation at the border as \"home crisis\" or \"artificial crisis.\" \"We're doing everything we can to help these people, but at the same time, we have to come back to defend our borders and the rule of law,\" Williams said in the August event. \"I had a meeting with law enforcement in my area and they said, here's a fact for you - we're all familiar with Route 35 - they said 50% of the DUIs on Route 35 are illegal. 90% of the 50% have no identity. So you give them a ticket, you can't put them in jail because the prisons are full here... so you send them on their way.\" There are many problems with Williams' claim. First of all, it seems to mix the DUIs and the DWIS. He referred to the DUIs case, an offence for minors found to be running a car with any traceable amount of alcohol in their systems, but then went to discuss the situation of offenders in prison. When minors are arrested in Texas by law enforcement agencies, they are transferred to the Juvenile Treatment Office and then to the juvenile detention facility if they are not released to a parent or guardian. Also, his claim that individuals arrested for DWIS sent \"on their way\" with a ticket because the prisons in Texas are full is inaccurate. Prison occupancy levels vary across the state and different practices are practised to address capacity issues. Williams also did not specify which parts of the highway he was considering and did not provide a time frame for his claim. Having spoken to officials of five law enforcement agencies in Texas and reviewed various records relating to arrests and immigration status, it is clear that there is no evidence to support Williams &apos; claim. None of the agencies we contacted were able to provide data to report the Williams statement directly. The information they can share revealed that a small percentage of all arrests of persons driving their cars drunk are individuals suspected of being in the country illegally. There are no official figures on this claim maintained by the 35-state law enforcement service, which is a highway of about 1,600 miles from Laredo on the Texas-Mexico border to Minnesota. The road passes through Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, Iowa. About 504 miles from the Texas Highway. Williams represents the 25th Congressional Chamber, which contains several unrelated parts between states. In Austin, his district has more than three miles near the centre of the city. It also includes about 55 miles from Highway 35 west of Abbott to Borlison and about 9 miles from Highway 35 east outside Milford. John Eto, Chief of Staff to Williams, said that the numbers came from law enforcement officers within Congress 25 \"in relation to their personal experience in the performance of their duties within their areas of operation.\" \"This isn't official Texas or DPS statistics,\" he said. Ito refused a request for information on the staff who provided the information, including the agency in which they worked. I-35 is part of the State Highway System and is maintained by the Ministry of Transport of Texas. Various law enforcement agencies enforce traffic laws on these routes, including the State Public Safety Department, which houses the State Highway Patrol. Local law enforcement officials also enforce traffic laws on parts of highways that fall within their jurisdiction. We first moved to the Texas Department of Public Safety for its figures on drunk driving arrests in I-35, but the spokesperson said: \"The data you require is not something that the Department follows.\" Williams said that he spoke with officers of the 25th Congressional Department, so we moved to four law enforcement agencies with areas of coverage that overlap with the I-35 section that passes through the area - Austin Police Department, Travis County Mayor's Office, Hill County Sheriff's Office, and Hillsboro Police Department. On 29 January 2021, local officers in Texas are allowed - but not required - to ask about the status of any person detained as a migrant, including during traffic stoppages. Local prisons are also required to comply with the requests of the federal immigration authorities to illegally detain persons suspected of being in the country. The United States Immigration and Customs Agency places detainees on persons arrested on criminal charges and \"who have probable cause to believe that they can be removed from the United States\" When a person is detained, the local law enforcement agencies must detain him for up to 48 hours, giving DIS personnel time to respond and detain him. None of the entities we contacted were able to provide the exact information we requested, owing to discrepancies in how information was recorded and kept across agencies. Open registry policies also limit information that can be disseminated about Agency detainees. Only one agency was able to provide any information as to whether the individuals arrested for these institutions had obtained an identity. Further data highlight the problem of Williams &apos; allegation, the Austin Police Department provided figures on all arrests for driving while using alcohol in I-35, but was unable to provide information on the immigration situation. The Department arrested 3,904 people from DWI from January 2014 to the end of August this year, according to records provided by the Department. The Travis County Mayor's Office tracks people detained in the county prison with DWI arrests that had been reported to the federal immigration authorities, but they do not run for information by the arrest site. The prison accommodates individuals arrested by several different law enforcement agencies throughout the province. From 1 August 2018 to 31 August this year, there were 6,182 detentions in the district prison for new arrests in the Ministry of the Interior. Of these arrests, 7.4 per cent were held by the Intelligence and Security Commission. Also in Travis County, the DWI court had information on DWI arrests and the percentage of persons arrested from another country, but the court staff were unable to reach persons here illegally or at their place of arrest. Nor can it provide information on whether or not the person has obtained an identity. Of all DWI cases brought to court in fiscal year 2018, about 20% of people were not United States citizens. It is unclear what percentage of this group of persons were illegally in the country. The Attorney General of Travis County, David Escamilla, whose office is prosecuting delicts such as DWIS, said he was unaware of the figures given by Williams. \"I've never seen this kind of measurement and found it highly unlikely,\" said Eskimela. The Hillsboro Police Department was able to provide information on the arrests carried out under the Directorate &apos; s mandate and the number of persons illegally arrested in the country at the time of their arrest, but could not limit the arrests by location. From 2011 to 2019, the Department arrested 180 members of the Internal Security Forces. Of these, three people had CIA detainees. Of these three persons, none had an identity. Finally, Captain. Justin Mansabo at the Hill County Mayor's Office said that the details of Williams' claim are \"not something we even have the ability to track.\" Our judgment, Williams, said, \"50 percent of DUI on Route 35 are illegal people. 90% of the 50% have no identity. There is no evidence to support Williams &apos; claim, which one assistant said was based on a meeting with law enforcement officials in his area. The assistant did not identify the staff or agency in which they worked. The data show that small percentages of persons accused of working in local health-care institutions in jurisdictions over the period 1 to 35 in the 25th Congressional District lack legal immigration status. We're assessing this pants claim on fire. Pants on fire - The statement is inaccurate and makes a ridiculous allegation.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00089"}
