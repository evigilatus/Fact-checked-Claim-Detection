The topic: The degree of public transparency Sanders has provided for his tax returns.\nTapper brought up the topic: \"I\u2019m kind of surprised that you haven\u2019t gone further on transparency. You released the summary page of your 2014 tax returns. Hillary Clinton has posted on her website the last eight years of her personal returns, all of the returns. Before the New York primary, will you match her? Will you post your full returns for the last eight years?\"\nSanders responded, \"You know who does our tax returns? My wife does our tax returns. We\u2019ve been a little bit busy lately. So we will get out as much information as we can. There ain\u2019t going to be very much exciting in that. I get a salary from the United States Senate, you know, there\u2019s not going to be anything new in it that people haven\u2019t seen for the last many years, but we will get it out as soon as we can.\"\nTapper wasn\u2019t satisfied. \"But nobody has seen them at all, I guess, is the point, and whether or not there\u2019s anything exciting in them....\"\nAt this point, Sanders interjected, \"No, that is not true. That is not true. Of course, we have released them in the past. Our financial situation, to the best of my knowledge, has not changed very much, but we will get out all of that information as soon as we can.\"\nHow transparent has Sanders been with his tax past returns? Not very, compared with others in the 2016 presidential field. Here\u2019s a closer look.\nAs our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker have noted, Tax Analysts, a publisher specializing in tax policy, has been collecting publicly available tax returns of presidential candidates and other top officials for its Tax History Project. This archive goes back as far as the 1913 tax returns of future president Franklin D. Roosevelt.\nHere\u2019s a look at what their current archive of the 2016 candidates looks like:\n\n\nIn other words, among the candidates still in the race, Sanders\u2019 releases are less extensive than anybody\u2019s but Donald Trump. (Trump, too, has faced criticism for refusing to share his returns.)\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd Sanders\u2019 shortcomings are actually bigger than the screenshot above would suggest. The 2014 filings Sanders released consist of just the first two summary pages of his Form 1040 and the equivalent summary pages from his home-state Vermont tax form.\nWhy does this matter? Unlike most of the other candidates, Sanders has not released the succeeding pages -- the nitty gritty detail of things like charitable donations and other types of itemized deductions. For instance, Clinton\u2019s release for tax year 2014 is 44 pages long, or more than 10 times the length of Sanders\u2019 for the same year.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Sanders, as a member of Congress, files annual financial disclosures, which are accessible online back to 2012. And as a presidential candidate, he also files financial disclosure documents to the Federal Election Commission.\nBut tax returns are much more detailed. And despite what Sanders said in the exchange with Tapper, his campaign did not provide PolitiFact with any earlier, publicly available tax forms. The campaign told the Post that it has not released any other tax returns prior to 2014. (The campaign did tell PolitiFact that they would release his 2015 returns once they are filed.)\nTax and disclosure experts we contacted agreed that Sanders\u2019 current disclosures are weak by historical standards.\n\"If I filed the first two pages of my return with the IRS, it would not take long for them to ding me,\" said Kenneth A. Gross of the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP and a specialist in political disclosure and ethics. \"There is a lot of information on the pages following the cover pages.\"\nJoseph J. Thorndike, the Tax Analysts official who heads the Tax History Project, agreed.\nSanders \"has not, in fact, released his most recent tax return,\" Thorndike said. \"He has released a portion of that return. The IRS would not accept a Form 1040 as a complete return and neither should voters. Also, it\u2019s worth noting that Sanders has not released any portion of his older returns. \u2026 If Mitt Romney had tried to release an incomplete return in 2012, the media would never have accepted it.\"\nOur ruling\nSanders told Tapper that his campaign has released his past tax returns.\nSanders said his 2015 return is forthcoming, and he has made other types of disclosures in the past, including congressional and presidential-candidate filings. But his releases of prior-year tax forms -- the specific documents Tapper asked about -- have been limited in several ways. He\u2019s only released information for one year, which pales compared to most other recent presidential candidates, and even that year\u2019s release only includes a summary page, not the full return. We rate his claim False.\nUPDATE: As he had promised, Sanders released his full 2014 tax return on April 15, 2016.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ba140e0d-4c11-436d-ad29-15e562ba5a98", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05152"}
