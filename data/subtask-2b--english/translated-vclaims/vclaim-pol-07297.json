On 14 September 2014, the State of the Union in CNN, Sin Amy Klobochar, D-Minn, published a tale from her time as a prosecutor to explain the ills caused by domestic violence. \"We had a poster outside the door so everyone could see it when they came. It was a picture of a woman who was hit with a bandage on her nose carrying a little kid. \"And the words read, \"Hit your wife, and your son goes to prison.\" \"The children... who saw it happen, Klobochar said, \"Twice they are likely to commit themselves.\" Klobochar concluded that because national football put \"outside their players as role models,\" they had \"to develop a different culture.\" We were interested in verifying Klobochar's claim that children who witness domestic violence \"probably twice to commit it themselves.\" We want to be clear that watching domestic violence means watching it at the baby's house -- not watching TMZ video. Com Rice. However, the point of \"twice as likely\" is fairly common among defenders against domestic abuse, and suffices to say that it existed for some time. The domestic violence literature we have seen is often cited in a 1990 book entitled Physical Violence in American Families: Risk Factors and Adaptation to Violence in 8,145 Families. This book compiled the results of the historic 1975 and 1985 national surveys of domestic violence, which constituted 60-minute face-to-face interviews and 30-minute telephone interviews with thousands of American families, respectively. On the basis of these interviews, authors have explained how various factors influence the incidence of domestic violence. Most writers relate to gender and their roles in domestic violence, but the section on the effects on children beats survey figures on whether the abusers said they had witnessed child abuse. That produced a \"probably twice\" estimate. The experts we spoke with told us that no final or comprehensive study has been conducted since then, although other studies have challenged the issue of intergenerational transmission of domestic violence. Jacqueline Campbell, a professor at Johns Hopkins School of Nursing for Domestic Violence, said: \"We have long known that the greatest risk factor for abuse of wives and children is to watch domestic violence in the home or to be abused.\" So \"people didn't repeat the search for a while,\" Campbell said, \"A lot of things are old and most of them are cyclic.\" On January 27, 2021, Marco Rubio wrote in his remarks: \"Only in the Third World do you see this routine use of the trials of former leaders?\" According to the study, children who have witnessed any violence are 1.6 times more likely to become abusive to adults. Thus, Klobochar &apos; s claim is well founded in both old and new literature. There are literally dozens of studies on this issue, although different studies tell different stories. An analysis conducted in 2000 of 39 different studies on this issue found a \"small-to-medium\" relationship between certification and commission. The studies in that survey, although it was two decades ago, ranged from showing a causal relationship between testimony and commission to showing no relationship at all. This confirms the larger point of Klobochar that domestic violence of parents has negative consequences for their children, but this is not the same as these children do \"probably twice to commit themselves.\" Ruth Glenn, Executive Director of the National Coalition against Domestic Violence, said that it was particularly difficult and perhaps inappropriate to establish figures on domestic violence. Glenn said, \"I'm probably not gonna say twice.\" \"So I'd like to say it's an additional risk factor. I feel nervous when we start identifying data, because there aren't enough data to back it up. Domestic violence occurs in families, and each family is an individual unit.\" In other words, there is sufficient suggestion that children who witness domestic violence are more likely to commit it, but it is difficult to say such a precise thing as \"probably twice.\" Domestic violence \"is difficult to measure for different and distinct reasons,\" Glenn said, from the lack of \"good data\" on those accused and convicted of domestic violence to cases of confidentiality with their victims. Even when researchers can obtain positive data, there are systemic concerns. Studies on children experiencing domestic violence often included the clinical population - those with family problems, and thus a non-representational sample - and asked respondents to report themselves and report retroactively. It is also difficult, according to the studies referred to by Campbell, to rid domestic violence of other family issues - such as mental health and drug abuse. Our Governor, Klobochar, arguing that the National Football Union has a responsibility to hold its \"work models\" accountable to \"a different culture,\" said that children who witness domestic violence in their households \"twice are likely to abide by it.\" There are peer-reviewed forensic studies that carry the claim of Klobochar. However, in general, although there is consensus that watching domestic violence exposes children to a greater risk of domestic violence themselves, accurate figures differ. The measurement of domestic violence is very difficult for a variety of reasons, and no recent comprehensive study has been undertaken. So these kids say \"probably twice\" domestic violence is a little too precise. We assess Klobochar's claim mostly true.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07297"}
