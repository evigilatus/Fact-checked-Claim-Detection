In the ninth congressional district of North Carolina, Mark Harris hit the current Republican Robert Pettinger while arguing with Bettinger was not loyal enough to Trump. Harris is accusing his democratic opponent, Dan McCready, of wanting to take legal steps to get Trump out of the Oval Office. In our debate, Dan McCreedy doubled his support for the liberal Belusi weapons control programme, disrespecting our flag, and isolating our president, tweeting Harris after a television debate on 10 October. The tweet was exchanged more than 160 times. Is that really what McCready said? Let's look at the tape. The full discussion is available on Charlotte &apos; s observer website. Part of the discussion can also be found on c-span.org, which also contains a partial version to make the comments of candidates more easily tracked. For this fact-finding, Polyte Fawcett chose to focus on the most specific allegations, that McCreedy wanted to accuse Trump. However, if you watch the debate, you will see that McCready said that he would prefer to check the background of \"general sense\" weapons, without explaining what such a policy might look like. McCready said that he stood in favour of science but added that he understood that a person facing discrimination might kneel \"because he did not feel heard.\" Pelosi and McCreedy McCreedy repeatedly said that he would not vote for Nancy Pelosi as a speaker if the Democrats were able to control the house. On his part, Harris pushed backwards against McCready's claim that he would not support Belusi as a speaker, arguing that the individual McCready's vote for the spokesperson would not matter in the grand scheme of things. \"There's some naiveness, if you want, to think that you'll go to Washington as a democracy and not support Nancy Belusi who frankly spends that $350,000... \"There's a reason for that. If Mr. McCready is elected, he is only a figure that would push Democrats towards the majority.\" If that happens, \"Nancy Belusi has already done math. She's gonna be the speaker.\" The back and forth occur between signs of 27 to 30 minutes of video C-Span. Belauce did not commit herself to isolating Trump. This election season Republicans raised the possibility that Democrats might accuse the president. However, as our friends noted in Factcheck.org in March, Belusi did not call for the isolation of Trump and voted to schedule two attempts at isolation, which actually stopped them. As the election approach approached, Belusi maintained her position that isolation was not a priority, but did not exclude it. On January 26, 2021, in the North Carolina tweet, Secretary of State Ellen Marshall, Jenna Woodsworth stated, \"She has won state-wide races more than anyone else is likely to be alive.\" By Paul Spect \u2022 February 1, 2012, McCreedy discussed the discussion. What about McCreedy? Did he say in the debate that he was going to vote to accuse Trump? 26 minutes before video C-Span, the moderator noted that Democrats might dominate the House of Representatives in this year &apos; s elections. If that happens, some Democrats may try to accuse Trump. \"If you're elected, will you support it or not?\" The manager's asking. Macready didn't show yes or no. \"These types of decisions are very serious and need to be addressed on the basis of facts and evidence. Since I am a small business owner, I do not deal with assumptions, but with facts,\" as McCready said. \"This is a decision - or any decision concerning the Constitution - that I will seriously deal with on the basis of the facts at the time.\" Harris didn't press McCready to charge Trump and the conversation went ahead. In a consistent and unobligated manner, Harris' tweet said in the debate \"dual\" to his support for the isolation of Trump. But Paulette Fuck didn't find evidence of McCreedy's earlier announcement of that desire. In fact, several news articles stated that McCready was not committed to the possibilities of isolation, specifically. He was criticized for being \"very mysterious.\" In August, surveillance quoted Charlotte as saying the same phrase, \"I do not deal with assumptions,\" which he used in the discussion. Also in August, The New York Times wrote that McCreedy showed a little appetite to talk about isolation. However, the Times story pointed out that the California billionaire Tom Styre, \"who led a national effort in favour of protest throughout the year, pledged $500,000 to help\" McCreedy. Our rule, Harris, said that in his interview with McCreedy on October 10, McCreedy doubled his support for Belusi's liberal agenda of isolating our president. McCreedy's always kept himself away from Belusi. No matter what, Belusi and McCreedy didn't commit themselves to accusing Trump. When they did not object to isolation, they left the door open to the idea. But that's not the same public statement that it's part of the democratic agenda or the McCreedy agenda. We value this allegation wrong.
