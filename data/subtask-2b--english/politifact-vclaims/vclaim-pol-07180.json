This claim is followed by a laundry list of actions about which the DCCC thinks voters will dislike.\nSoutherland\u2019s office denied this, and when we\u2019ve looked at this claim before, we took a dim view of such hyperbole. When a pro-Democratic group said Arkansas Republican Rep. Tom Cotton voted in favor of \"taxpayer-funded health care for life,\" PolitiFact\u00a0rated it Pants On Fire!\nLet\u2019s see how this claim fares on the Truth-O-Meter.\nLaw of the land\nThis gets a little complicated, so bear with us.\nThe flap stems from the fact that Congress has to abide by the terms of President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care law as much as you do.\nBack in 2010, Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa attached an amendment to the law requiring members of Congress to obtain health insurance through the exchanges touted by the bill. Before that, lawmakers bought insurance through the Federal Employee Health Benefit Program, in which federal employees younger than 65 chose a plan and split premiums with the federal government.\nThis is much like the way it works for anyone with an employee-sponsored group plan -- in this case, it\u2019s just that their employer is the U.S. government.\nIf Congress ever repealed Obamacare, the Federal Employee Health Benefit Program would return. And the GOP\u00a0majority has been trying to repeal Obamacare for years now, voting to do away with or alter the law more than 50 times, depending on what you count.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe commercial cites a July 11, 2012, vote on HR 6079, a repeal bill that netted a yes vote from Southerland. The congressman had plenty of other yes votes on similar bills -- his online House profile boasts that he has voted to \"to repeal, replace, and defund Obamacare over 40 times.\" -- but the DCCC pointed to a story in The Hill about this specific instance.\n\"Not only are Republicans helping their insurance company donors, they\u2019re also trying to help themselves,\" an unnamed Democratic official told The Hill in the July 9 article before the vote. \"House Republicans are set to repeal the promise that members of Congress have health care just like everyone else and to restart the perk of lifetime government health care for themselves.\"\nUsing that for proof is dubious, as the Democrats are basically citing one of their own anonymously as a source. They are essentially laundering a Democratic talking point through a nonpartisan newspaper.\nSo let\u2019s say Obamacare was magically legislated away and the old congressional system returns. Here\u2019s the problem with the claim: Lawmakers and their aides don\u2019t get to use the federal health plan forever.\nIf a politician loses an election or an aide leaves their congressional job, they will no longer be eligible for the Federal Employee Health Benefit Program. Then, when they turn 65, Medicare will take over, but a lawmaker, if they choose, can keep their current plan in order to pay for things Medicare doesn\u2019t cover. In either case, they still have to keep paying premiums.\nMeanwhile, in the real world, if a member of Congress is buying an insurance plan off an exchange, that coverage is subject to the same terms as anyone else\u2019s policy. Again, if they don\u2019t pay the premium, they don\u2019t have coverage. That\u2019s hardly guaranteeing any lawmaker lifetime health insurance.\nSoutherland\u2019s office pointed out the Panama City Republican voted in favor of the House\u2019s budget resolution in April 2014. That bill encompassed the GOP\u2019s budget policy, actually stating in part, \"Retirement benefits for Members of Congress should not include free, taxpayer-funded health care for life.\" It passed along party lines and was sent to the Senate, where it is stalled.\nOur ruling\nThe DCCC says Southerland \"voted himself health care for life.\"\nThis is a campaign tactic the Democrats have used before, referring to how members of Congress would get to fall back to the Federal Employee Health Benefit Program should Obamacare be repealed and its insurance marketplaces be shuttered.\nThis federal program doesn\u2019t last for life, but only as long as a member of Congress or an aide works for the federal government. It also switches over to Medicare when a lawmaker still in office turns 65.\nWe rate this claim Pants On Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07180"}
