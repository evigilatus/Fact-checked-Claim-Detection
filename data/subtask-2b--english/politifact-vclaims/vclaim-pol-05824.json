So your PolitiFact Georgia scribe ordered a pint \u2013 even Beerack, er, Barack Obama knows the value of a good beer summit \u2013 and settled in to research whether the state\u2019s brewpubs can\u2019t sell their products to go.\nBitter brew\nGeorgia\u2019s history of direct beer sales to consumers is a bitter one. Craft brewers have sought for at least a decade to change the state law that keeps them from making money from those who want to quaff their wares.\nIn this year\u2019s legislative session, Senate Bill 63 originally would have given breweries and brewpubs their wish.\nBut the final version instead gave craft brewers the ability only to sell tours and give away their product \u2013 a backdoor way to sell limited amounts of beer to go - and stripped out brewpubs\u2019 ability to do the same.\nControversy is brewing over that change, now that the state Department of Revenue has issued a bulletin forbidding brewers from charging different prices for the tours based on the value of the beers offered.\nAnd brewpubs? The law makes it clear they must sell only on site or to wholesale dealers \u2013 the middleman that direct sales would avoid.\n\"We have had so many people come in, locals, students, parents and they love our beer and want to take some home with them,\" said Moran, who co-owns the Slice and Pint and two locations of the 5 Seasons brewpub. \"But the state legislature said those people can\u2019t buy beer where they want to. It\u2019s hard to take.\"\nIt\u2019s also hard to pin down. Nancy Palmer, executive director of the Georgia Craft Brewers Guild, agreed the hard line in SB 63 says brewpubs cannot sell their product to go.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Steineke\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembly Republicans \u201chave come to the table\u201d and were part of \u201cgive and take\u201d compromise on a coronavirus bill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut hypothetically, she said, brewpubs could sell a growler of beer that they did not produce on site.\nThat\u2019s because the state license for alcohol sales applies to bars, package stores and brewpubs alike and allows for sales both on and off premise.\n\"As far as the state is concerned, you could walk around Kroger drinking beer,\" Palmer said. \"Of course, Kroger doesn\u2019t allow that. And local governments are the ones who decide if they will allow on- or off-site sales.\"\nDecatur, for instance, allows people to buy growlers to go from growler shops \u2013 and also sample in the store.\nBut Slice & Pint sits outside the city limits and wouldn\u2019t qualify for that perk because it is both a retail operation, like a growler shop, and a manufacturer, by making beer.\nMoran\u2019s operation is also unique in that he rejects selling to a wholesaler. The state has just 12 other brewpubs, Palmer said, and all sell to that middleman, who can then make it available to go at package stores and the like.\nRules on the Department of Revenue website confirm use of wholesalers, as does the new legislation. A spokesman for the department declined to comment.\nOur ruling\nA brewpub owner in DeKalb County has created a series of beers designed to call attention to what his says is the state\u2019s interference between his business and consumers.\nThe IPA in question effectively claims that brewpubs can\u2019t sell their products to go.\nA new state law is clear that neither brewpubs nor breweries can make those sales.\nThe brewpub does have the option to sell to wholesalers, who can then make the suds available to consumers. But that is not the same thing as getting a growler to go with your pizza.\nWe rate the claim True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05824"}
