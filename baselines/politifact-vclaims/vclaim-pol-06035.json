Voter ID laws seem to be working well in Mexico and they worked well in Texas. Our elections should be free from fraud and abuse. The people of Texas deserve no less.\"\n\nSid Miller posted this meme on his Facebook page Aug. 16, 2015.\nMiller, the Republican state agriculture commissioner, piped up after a federal appeals panel directed a U.S. district judge to reconsider plaintiff claims that the Texas ID mandate, passed into law in 2011, was crafted by the Republican-majority Legislature with a discriminatory purpose. The three-judge panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals also affirmed the district judge\u2019s finding that the law\u2019s discriminatory effects violate a U.S. Voting Rights Act provision barring voting practices or procedures that discriminate on the basis of race, skin color and ethnicity. The panel directed the judge, Nelva Gonzales Ramos of Corpus Christi, to consider an \"appropriate remedy.\"\nA previous fact check\nIt wasn\u2019t news to us that Mexico\u2019s government issues voter IDs featuring each voter\u2019s photo and personal information. In checking a 2011 claim about birth certificates in Mexico, we noted that then-state Rep. Leo Berman, R-Tyler, brought one of the voter cards from Mexico to an interview on \"Capital Tonight,\" a weeknight news show produced by Time Warner Cable News. Berman said then: \"If you don\u2019t have this card in Mexico, you don\u2019t vote.\" The legislator, who died in 2015, added that each card has a \u00a0photo, fingerprint and \"your life\u2019s history.\"\nBy telephone, Todd Smith, a political consultant to Miller, told us Miller, a former Texas House member, had seen the photo ID brandished by Berman.\nGovernment spells out ID requirement\nWe checked information posted online by Mexico's government. To vote in Mexico, according to Mexico\u2019s National Electoral Institute, adult citizens must apply to the \"Electoral Roll\" by personally submitting an official form that includes their signature, fingerprint and photograph to a field office of the Federal Electoral Registry. There\u2019s an office in every electoral district. There are some exceptions, such as for citizens who physically can\u2019t go to the offices.\nFor about two decades, the institute has issued free \"photo-voting cards\" \u2014 \"an essential document to exercise the right to vote,\" according to the site. They include the owner\u2019s address, electoral district, full name, age and ID number.\nMexico experts concur\nBy email, Kenneth Greene, a University of Texas associate professor of government, told us Miller was correct in that \"Mexico has an excellent voter registration system that was created to overcome decades of fraud (i.e., multiple votes, voting by dead people).\" Greene cautioned, though, \u00a0it would be a mistake to compare Mexico\u2019s history of fraud with the 31\u00a0credible incidents of U.S. voter fraud that could have been headed off with photo ID from 2000 through 2014 \u2014 in a period more than 1 billion ballots were cast in primary and general elections. That tally was detailed in August 2014 by Justin Levitt, a Loyola University election-law expert, for The Washington Post\u2019s Wonkblog.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso by email, Eric Olson of the Latin American program at the Washington, D.C.-based Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, said: \"Historically there has been so much electoral fraud in Mexico (not by immigrants but by the long-ruling governing party PRI) that Mexico undertook a major electoral reform in 1996 that included the creation of an electoral ID card that has become a default national ID card.\" Olson said the card hasn\u2019t ended voter fraud, \"but it\u2019s much more difficult.\"\nMindful of Miller\u2019s mention of a hologram and thumbprint on each card, we checked the institute\u2019s website, which says the front of each card has a hologram that changes color depending on the angle of light. The hologram is imprinted with the institute\u2019s name, the agency says, and the agency\u2019s initials, \"INE.\" Also there: an element that enables the ID to be verified by a radio frequency, the agency says.\nWe looked at a sample voter card on the website which showed on its back the voter\u2019s signature and what looked to us like a thumbprint:\n\nSOURCE: Web page, \"Modelo Actual de Credencial para Votar,\" Mexico National Electoral Institute (accessed Aug. 24, 2015)\nMeantime, Olson put us in touch with Carlos Heredia, an associate professor at the Center for Research and Teaching in Economics in Mexico City. By email, Heredia responded with a copy of his voter ID and advised that the card \"does include a thumbprint (back side) and hologram of the voter's picture (front side).\"\nA six-day delay in 1988\nNext, we looked briefly at how the ID cards came to be.\nBlame Mexico\u2019s disputed 1988 presidential election, which was won by Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the nominee of the long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party. Against two foes, Salinas drew a record-low 48.8 percent of the vote. But after the results weren\u2019t announced until six days after the election day, a reform push flowered, culminating in the birth of the electoral institute, which was handed the duty of creating a \"fraud-proof\" voter ID card that would show each voter\u2019s photograph, Vikram K. Chand said in his 2001 book, \"Mexico\u2019s Political Awakening.\"\nChand said the government had \u00a0\"lamely ascribed\" the six-day lag \"to computer crashes, heavy voter turnout, and even \u2018atmospheric conditions.\u2019\" In 1994, Chand wrote, the institute\u2019s director revealed the government in 1988 had suspended the vote count amid panic about early returns suggesting a non-PRI hopeful, Cuauht\u00e9moc C\u00e1rdenas of the National Democratic Front, was ahead. In the end, C\u00e1rdenas carried Mexico City and four states, placing second.\nBy phone, Christopher Wilson, a Wilson Center expert on Mexico, told us that through the 1990s, the institute was strengthened to give more legitimacy to national elections. Now \"there are a lot of issues about the legitimacy of the electoral process in Mexico,\" Wilson said. But \"none are focused on the legitimacy of the physical process of voting itself, the identification of the voters, the getting of voters\" or \"the immediate counting of votes.\"\nOur ruling\nMiller said: \"To vote in Mexico every eligible Mexican citizen has to have a tamper-proof photo-ID card with a thumbprint and an embossed hologram.\"\nMexico has required secure photo IDs at the polls for nearly 20 years.
