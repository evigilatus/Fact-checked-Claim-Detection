However, Elorza could not leave all this behind and immediately criticized Cheancy, whose last term in office ended in 2002 with a federal conviction for conspiracy to blackmail. \"In the last six years of the Cianci administration, violent crime was down in the United States,\" said Elorza. \"He was at the bottom of the area. She was in Rhode Island. But he was in Providence.\" Elorza made the same allegation in a news release on Friday, so we were curious -- was Providence really attracting national and regional trends when it reached violent crime in the late 1990s and early 2000s? We went directly to the FBI website, which collects crime data from all over the country as part of the Consolidated Crime Reporting Program. Under this programme, four offences are classified as violent crimes: manslaughter, manslaughter, forced rape, robbery and aggravated assault. The Federal Bureau of Investigation calculates the total number of violent crimes in the expanding geographical areas: cities, towns, states, regions and the nation as a whole. The Agency also calculates region-specific rates by determining the number of violent crimes per 100,000 persons. For our analysis, we used the period from 1997 to 2002, the last six years of the last time we worked in Siancy. At the national level, the rate of violent crime decreased from 611 per 100,000 persons in 1997 to 4,494 in 2002, according to the data of the Consolidated Crime Report. It also fell for the north-eastern region, from 536.4 in 1997 to 416.5 in 2002, and for the smaller New England region, from 1,441 in 1997 to 9,346 in 2002. For Rhode Island, it also declined from 333.5 in 1997 to 285.6 in 2002. What about Providence? The rate of violent crime has already increased from 674.8 in 1997 to 734.9 in 2002. Marco Rubio says on January 27, 2021 in his remarks: \"Only in the Third World do you see this routine use of trials of former leaders.\" The rate has already risen and declined a few times during that period. If you represent those numbers, it'll look a little bit like a drawer. The final result, however, was 8.9 per cent higher in 2002 than in 1997. We also looked at other major urban centres in New England to see how they arrived between 1997 and 2002. Of the other nine cities with the highest 10 cities in the region by population (a list of Boston, Hartford and New Haven), only Waterbury, Kon, also experienced a slight increase in the violent crime rate for that period. In other parts of the country, New York, Los Angeles, Atlanta and Washington, D.C., experienced a decline in the rate. Houston and Philadelphia have seen increases. Rhode Island &apos; s policy explored crime trends in the preceding lines, and attributed the decline in national crime rates in the 1990s and SCCPs to population ageing, community policing, arms repression and other factors. Providence police officials blamed the increase in violent crime in the city over the same period for more people and more traffic in the city centre, according to daily stories from that time. It should be noted that Elorza chose only part of the time he spent in his post to make his point of view clear rather than the entire period of his second opponent in office, which began in 1991. Could it be that the crime rate has declined cumulatively over those 12 years in office -- and it has done so very much? Despite the eventual increase, Providence has experienced a net decrease - a very significant decrease - from 1,274 violent crimes per 100,000 persons to 734.9. In fact, the 42 per cent decrease in the rate of violent crimes committed by Providence between 1991 and 2002 has overcome the 35 per cent decrease in the national rate for those same years and the 38 per cent decrease in the Rhode Island rate. However, David Ortiz, the spokesman for Elorza, said that the upward trend at the end of Chianxi &apos; s tenure was significant because it was contrary to what was happening elsewhere. :: Governor Jorge Elorza said that the rate of violent crime had increased in the last years of the second Cheancy as mayor, while similar rates had declined for the State, the region and the nation. While Ilorza carefully chose a period of time between 1997 and 2002 to clarify a point, this does not mean that this point is incorrect. The rate of murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault for those years has risen, even though - and this makes the prosecution noteworthy - it has declined elsewhere. However, Elorza &apos; s claim ignores the broader context, namely, that the increase did not wipe out the gains seen in previous years from the second mission of Xianxi as mayor. If Elorza had chosen 12 years to take office on the second occasion, he could not file the same claim. If he had chosen eight years, he wouldn't have been able to do it either. Because the statement needs to be clarified, we often judge it correctly.
