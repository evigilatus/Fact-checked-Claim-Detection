John Barrow of Georgia has helped support the implementation of \"Obamacare.\"", "truth_label": "barely-true", "date": "stated on April 30, 2013 in a press release:", "title": "GOP attacks Barrow on 'Obamacare' votes", "text": "Call it a pre-emptive strike, guilt by association or just good ol\u2019 fashioned partisan politics.\n\nThe National Republican Senatorial Committee sent out a news release shortly after the April 29 debate between the candidates running for a vacant congressional seat in South Carolina. Former Gov. Mark Sanford, a Republican, won the seat Tuesday.\n\nThe committee claimed in its release that Sanford\u2019s opponent, Democrat Elizabeth Colbert Busch, was attempting to distance herself from the federal health care law, commonly called \"Obamacare.\"\n\nHere\u2019s the paragraph that drew our interest because of its Georgia connection:\n\n\"ObamaCare has gone from being an \u2018abstract\u2019 discussion to a real life pain for families and businesses which has Democrats who supported this costly agenda like Bruce Braley, Mark Pryor, Mark Begich, Kay Hagan, Mary Landrieu, Jeanne Shaheen, John Barrow, Mark Udall, Gary Peters, Al Franken, Mark Warner, Tom Udall, Dick Durbin and Jeff Merkley in a tailspin,\" it stated.\n\nBarrow, from Augusta, is in his fifth term in the U.S. House of Representatives. Republicans have tried hard in recent years to unseat Barrow, who has fashioned himself as a moderate. We wondered about the accuracy of this claim because Barrow voted in 2010 against the creation of the health care law.\n\n\"I am strongly in favor of reforming the health care system, but I don\u2019t think this bill is going to do it, and therefore I can\u2019t support it,\" Barrow said before the vote. \"It puts too much of the burden of paying for it on working folks who are already being overcharged, and that\u2019s not fair. It threatens to overwhelm Medicaid in Georgia, and that's not right. And it barely touches the insurance companies, and that's not smart. We can do better and I\u2019m ready to start.\"\n\nNRSC spokeswoman Brook Hougesen said the claim is accurate, citing two votes Barrow cast against repealing the entire health care law. Those votes came in January 2011 and last July.\n\nThe repeal measure passed in the Republican-controlled House, but repeal efforts consistently failed in the U.S. Senate, where Democrats held a slim majority.\n\n\"He voted against ObamaCare before voting twice to keep the costly health care overhaul in place,\" Hougesen said via email.\n\nHougesen concluded by saying: \"Facts are a stubborn thing, and no matter how hard Barrow or Obama attempt to cast blame on Republicans for their disastrous law, it\u2019s theirs to own.\"\n\nBarrow spokesman Richard Carbo said the NRSC\u2019s accusations against his boss are \"the same song and dance from these folks who don\u2019t necessarily understand how the process works.\"\n\nCarbo said there are pieces of the health care law that Barrow wants to keep in place, such as prohibiting insurance companies from denying care because of pre-existing conditions. Barrow also supports the provision that allows children to stay on their parents\u2019 health insurance until they\u2019re 26 years old. Carbo said Barrow wants to remove some of the most controversial pieces of the health care law, such as:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Independent Payment Advisory Board, which is designed to examine quality and access to care under the law, the effects of changes in payments to providers.\n\n\n\nThe individual mandate, which requires nearly all Americans to have health insurance or face a tax penalty.\n\n\n\nAn employer mandate that businesses with more than 50 full-time employees offer health care coverage to their employees or pay a penalty of $2,000 per worker above 30 employees.\n\n\n\nBill Custer, the director of Georgia State University\u2019s Center for Health Services Research, said the health care law is complicated and blanket statements about its impact on businesses and people \"are wrong on either side.\"\n\nCuster said the law will help some small businesses that were previously unable to hire more workers because they can now offer health insurance or the worker can buy it through a health insurance exchange. Some larger businesses, he said, may be hurt by the law because of its potential penalties.\n\n\"The overarching answer is adding and removing some provisions will help and hurt some individuals and businesses. It\u2019s not an easy divide,\" said Custer, an associate professor who previously was an economist in a division of the American Medical Association and has written several papers on health insurance.\n\nRobert Zirkelbach, a spokesman for the Washington-based America's Health Insurance Plans, sent us a chart showing information from five different organizations that concluded removing the individual mandate would result in millions of additional uninsured Americans and an increase in private health insurance premiums.\n\n\"If you remove just the mandates and leave everything else in place, the cost of coverage would increase quite dramatically,\" he said.\n\nAHIP, the national trade association representing the health insurance industry, supports bipartisan legislation introduced in February that would remove the health insurance tax scheduled to take effect in 2014. Zirkelbach noted Barrow is one of the bill\u2019s sponsors.\n\n\"Unless this tax is repealed, next year an average family will pay over $300 in higher premiums, seniors enrolled in Medicare Advantage will face $220 in reduced benefits and higher out-of-pocket costs, and state Medicaid managed care plans will incur an additional $80 in costs for each person covered,\" AHIP wrote after the bill was introduced.\n\nZirkelbach sent us a chart showing the tax will result in an increase in premiums of between $5,539 and $6,777 for the average Georgia family over a 10-year stretch.\n\nSo where does this leave us? The NRSC says Barrow\u2019s unwillingness to vote for repealing the health care law is a \"real life pain\" for people and businesses because of its costs.\n\nAn argument can be made that Barrow\u2019s votes against repeal are tantamount to indirect support of its implementation. In other words, the NRSC says, Barrow owns it.\n\nBarrow, however, voted against the original Obamacare legislation and wants to repeal various parts of the law. The GOP cherry-picked a few votes to stretch a point here on a lawmaker it wants to defeat,\n\nOur rating: Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09349"}
