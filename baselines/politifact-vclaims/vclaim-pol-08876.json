Most economists express worry about an ongoing decline in \"labor-force participation\" -- the percentage of Americans 16 or older who are working, or who are actively looking for a job. The percentage for August 2013 was the lowest it\u2019s been since August 1978, and if fewer people are working, that\u2019s a drag on the nation\u2019s potential for rapid economic growth.\nBut as we will see, determining how much of this decline in labor-force participation is due to the poor economy, as opposed to broader demographic trends, is tricky.\nWhen we asked Boehner\u2019s office for the source of this statistic, a spokesman pointed us to news reports about the most recent employment report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nThe bureau found that between July 2013 and August 2013, the economy created a net 169,000 additional jobs, while the size of the civilian labor force dropped by 312,000. (The civilian labor force refers to working-age people who are either employed or were unemployed but looking for work.) That supports Boehner\u2019s comment that more Americans are leaving the workforce finding jobs.\nBut economists say the statistic Boehner chose to illustrate the broader trend isn\u2019t ideal.\nFor starters, it combines numbers from two different surveys that don\u2019t really produce apples-to-apples comparisons. And there are two more worrisome issues:\n\u2022 One-month comparisons are less reliable than longer-term comparisons. There\u2019s a lot of statistical \"noise\" from month to month in this type of data -- \"noise\" that tends to balance out over a longer period of time.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is important because, while Boehner was correct about the most recent jobs report, the trends in the most recent month actually run counter to what\u2019s been happening over the longer term.\nSince the start of the year, the civilian labor force has fallen by 168,000 people, but the number of people employed has risen by 848,000. And over the past year -- from August 2012 to August 2013 -- the civilian labor force has risen by 839,000 people, while the number of people employed has risen by a little more than 2 million. (The numbers are only slightly different if you take into account an annual adjustment for population growth that occurs in January.)\nEither way, the gain in employment was bigger than the gain (or loss) in people in the labor force. So by choosing to focus on the most recent month, Boehner is essentially cherry-picking the one period for which the trends don\u2019t look very favorable.\n\u2022 Using the full labor force to gauge how many people are \"leaving the workforce\" isn\u2019t perfect. Americans are aging -- the leading edge of the baby boomers is turning 67, so every month, large numbers of Americans are retiring. In addition, the statistic Boehner used captures Americans as young as age 16, and many Americans between that age and their early 20s aren\u2019t part of the labor market because they are going to school.\nHow much does this skew the numbers? It\u2019s hard to say for sure, but in August 2013, just under 7 percent of those categorized as \"not in the labor force\" were also categorized as \"want a job now.\" The bulk of the remaining 93 percent are likely school- and retirement-age Americans. So many of the non-workers Boehner\u2019s referring to aren\u2019t people actively engaged in the job market.\nWe can make a more targeted estimate by focusing on those who \"want a job now.\" This particular statistic is not offered in a seasonally adjusted version, so we can\u2019t compare one month to the next. The only valid comparison we can do is between August 2012 and August 2013.\nWhat does that show? It turns out that the number of people not in the labor force but who wanted a job fell by 740,000 over that year-long period, while the number of people employed over the same period rose by more than 2.2 million.\nSo, looking at it this way, Boehner\u2019s claim misses the longer-term trend.\nOur ruling\nBoehner said that, according to the most recent jobs report, \"we've got more Americans leaving the workforce than we have finding jobs.\"\nThat is what the most recent one-month jobs report found. However, there\u2019s less to this piece of data than meets the eye. Looking at the year-to-date and year-to-year figures show the opposite pattern, and Boehner\u2019s calculation doesn\u2019t account for the large numbers of baby boomers who are retiring because they no longer want to work.\nIn all, Boehner has stated one fact correctly -- and put his finger on an issue of concern to economists -- but he\u2019s ignored other pieces of that give a more nuanced impression.
