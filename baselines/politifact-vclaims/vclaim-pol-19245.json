No, this isn\u2019t a movie", "text": "A new conspiracy theory has blossomed among some people who believed that former President Donald Trump had an elaborate scheme to remain in office: that Biden\u2019s inauguration was fake, and he isn\u2019t the real president.\u00a0\nThe theory started to gain traction online when the Jan. 20 \"storm\" disrupting Biden\u2019s inauguration didn\u2019t happen. It\u00a0 points to a myriad of ill-perceived discrepancies for what a real inauguration and presidency should look like.\u00a0\nThese claims fall short. Biden is the real president and his inauguration was legit. The day\u2019s events were broadcast and live-streamed by several outlets including ABC, CNN, C-SPAN, Fox News, NBC and PBS.\u00a0\nThe event was much smaller this year due to COVID-19 restrictions. But we know it happened because it was witnessed and documented by elected officials, former presidents, military members, reporters, photographers and performers.\u00a0\nSocial media posts and videos spreading the theory were flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nWe debunked a variety of claims that argue the inauguration didn\u2019t happen and that Biden isn\u2019t the legitimate president.\u00a0\n\"The White House\u2019s inauguration video was unlisted\"\nSome people on Facebook claimed that the White House\u2019s official inauguration video was unlisted on YouTube because it had more dislikes than likes.\u00a0\nIndeed, the 34-minute video has many more dislikes than likes \u2014 currently 76,000 to 14,000 \u2014 but it is still up on the White House YouTube channel. Web archives show no record that the video was ever taken down.\n\"Biden\u2019s executive orders aren\u2019t available online\"\nAccording to one viral video, Trump\u2019s executive orders were available on the Office of the Federal Register website \"immediately,\" while there are still no sign of Biden\u2019s.\nThat\u2019s false. Biden\u2019s executive orders may not have been uploaded at the time the video was made, but the documents are published on the site now. The online register shows that it also took a few days for Trump\u2019s orders to be published after they were signed.\n\"Biden\u2019s granddaughters disappeared and reappeared in between frames of inauguration coverage\"\nSome claim that the inauguration was staged because Biden\u2019s granddaughters, who were standing behind him when he took the oath of office, suddenly disappeared in certain shots.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey didn\u2019t. Biden\u2019s granddaughters may not have been visible at certain points due to different camera angles, but they were present throughout the oath and did not move. They can also be seen standing behind Biden in photographs taken by Reuters and the Associated Press.\n\"Biden took a private plane to D.C.\"\nBiden\u2019s form of travel has nothing to do with the legitimacy of his presidency.\nBiden originally planned to travel to Washington by train from Delaware, but that plan changed when it was deemed too great a security risk. So he took a private jet, which was also a break from tradition.\u00a0\nUsually the outgoing administration provides a government plane to bring the president-elect to Washington for the inauguration. Trump, who refused to acknowledge Biden\u2019s victory until early January, opted to not attend the inauguration, becoming the first outgoing president in more than a century to skip the event.\nWe previously reached out to the White House, but couldn\u2019t confirm whether the Trump administration offered to provide transportation to the Bidens. CNN reported that \"a source familiar with the matter\" said the government didn\u2019t offer the Bidens a plane, but did not provide further details.\u00a0\n\"Biden\u2019s Oval Office is a movie set\"\nSome social media users have shared photos of Biden in the Oval Office and say they provide proof that it\u2019s not the real presidential office but a movie set owned by Castle Rock Entertainment.\u00a0\nFilm sets of the famous room exist, but there is no credible evidence that supports this. Biden made a public entrance into the White House on Jan. 20 and was photographed in the Oval Office shortly after. He has been seen in the White House several times in the days that have followed.\nSome point to a vehicle visible outside the window behind the Resolute Desk as Biden sits there, saying there is no parking lot in that location. But the Oval Office overlooks the South Lawn and has a private road and circular driveway, both places where the car could have been parked.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nA conspiracy theory circulating on social media says that Biden\u2019s inauguration was fake and that he isn\u2019t the real president.\nThe evidence is paltry. Biden was legally inaugurated as the 46th U.S. president on Jan. 20.\nWe rate the claims Pants on Fire!\nRELATED: Pro-Trump lawyer falsely claims Biden is an \u2018illegal president\u2019", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19245"}
