On Monday, the day before President Barack Obama's tour of El Paso and Austin, Reyes first referred to a comment made by the Republican spokesman Michael Steele. Last week, Steele said that before Congress takes immigration policy, the priority is \"the end of violence at the border must be -- we really can't deal with other issues until they're secured.\" His comment appeared in issue No. 3 (May) of the Roll Call, a newspaper of Capitol Hill. In a press release, Reyes said, \"You should focus on controlling the level of violence in his own country before defaming border communities, which are still among the safest places to live in America. .................................................................................... The fact remains that the six largest cities in Ohio have higher rates of violence and crime than every major city along the United States-Mexico border.\" Whoa. \u25cf Are the larger cities in Bucky State experiencing more violence and crime? It seems so. Reyes cited, as a precautionary measure, the research compiled by CQ Press, which in a press release issued in November 2010 stated that the latest compilation of crime information in each city reflected data on cities with at least 75,000 residents who reported crime data to the Federal Bureau of Investigation under its consolidated crime reporting programme as of September 2010. In 2009, the crime rates were higher in the six most densely populated cities of Ohio - Columbus, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Toledo, Akron, Dayton - than in six border cities: San Diego, El Paso, Laredo, Brownsville, McCallen, Yum, Arizona. The city of Ohio, Columbus, was 49 years old, the most classified border city, Laredo, was 144, according to CQ Press. We checked the population of each of the 10 cities with the United States Census Bureau. The 2010 figures indicate that the average population of Ohio cities was about 363,000, while the average population of border towns was just over 447,000. According to the CQ Press report, the rates of homicide, rape, theft and theft in the six cities of Ohio were higher than in the six border cities. Specifically, for homicide, Ohio city rates ranged from 25.5 per 100,000 inhabitants in Dayton to 9.7 per 100,000 inhabitants in Akron. Among the border districts, Laredo had the highest rate, with 7.5 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants, while El Paso had the lowest rate of 1.9. But in two categories of crimes, there are wrinkles that don't fit the limits. One day, approximately 501 severe assaults were committed per 100,000 inhabitants, the second of all inspected cities to Toledo, Ohio, where 629 aggravated assaults were committed per 100,000 inhabitants. Four cities in Ohio had higher rates than other border towns, although Columbus, with approximately 170 aggravated assaults per 100,000 inhabitants, was lower than any border towns except Brownsville and McCallen. With regard to car theft, Cleveland jumped to the cities reviewed, with a population of 939 per 100,000. However, Laredo was ranked second, with the number of residents in San Diego at about 654 per 100,000, while the number of residents in San Diego III was 570 per 100,000. After that, the carjacking rates in the other five most densely populated cities of Ohio were higher than those of one day, Arizona or McCallen. The lowest vehicle theft rates were in El Paso, 305 per 100,000 inhabitants, and Brownsville, 188 per 100,000 inhabitants. :: Conclusion: The six largest cities in Ohio recorded common crime rates and rates of murder, rape, theft and theft higher than the six main border cities. However, a border town experienced a higher rate of aggravated aggression than four cities in Ohio, while in Columbus the rate was higher than in two border cities. Also, except for one of Ohio's cities, carjacking rates were lower than Laredo. We're mostly evaluating the statement right. On 29 January, 2021 Correction, 10.25 a.m., 11 May 2011: on the day this article was published, we subsequently amended our reference to the rate of aggravated attacks in Columbus in 2009. The first article wrongly said that Ohio had the lowest rate of all the cities examined. In addition, the article &apos; s subsequent conclusion was amended to correct the reference to Columbus.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13119"}
