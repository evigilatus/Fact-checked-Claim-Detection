In fact, the piles will be very unbalanced. Tancredo is wrong to suggest that climate scientists are equally divided. The overwhelming consensus among them is that human beings are the main cause of global warming. In his interview on 31 January 2021, John Kerry says that Hurricane Harvey \"in Houston in five days more water fell on Niagara Falls in one year.\" The February 2007 report states that global warming was \"unclear\" and that most of it was caused by the concentrations of greenhouse gases caused by humans. The report stated that humans had caused a significant increase in atmospheric concentrations of CO2, CH4 and N2O since 1750. Yes, there have been conflicting studies over the years on global warming. However, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is an effort to reach international consensus. It has over 2,500 review experts, over 800 authors and over 450 lead authors working over the past six years.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00345"}
