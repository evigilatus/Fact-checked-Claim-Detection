We wondered if Degner was right.\nHemp comes cannabis plants like marijuana, but it doesn\u2019t contain the same level of tetrahydrocannabinol - THC, for short - that gets people high. Degner said keeping cannabis on a federal list of prohibited drugs is stifling an opportunity for farmers wanting to grow hemp that can be used to make clothes, rope, twine and other stuff.\nThirty-one states, including Virginia, have passed laws to allow hemp cultivation for commercial or research purposes, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. But federal regulations limit who can cultivate it. In Virginia, farmers may only grow it to sell to universities for research examining issues like how it fares in the state\u2019s climate and hemp\u2019s economic viability, said Elaine Lidholm, a spokeswoman for the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.\nThis brings us back to The Declaration of Independence, one of Virginia\u2019s most acclaimed products. Rampant rumors that the actual document - the one on display at the National Archives - was written on hemp paper are untrue. Officials at Monticello - the home of Thomas Jefferson, the main author of the Declaration - say the document was penned on parchment, which is made from animal skin.\n\"A number of sites on the Internet claim that the Declaration of Independence was written on paper made from hemp. As far as we know, this is not true,\" Monticello says on its website.\nDegner told us he misspoke; what he\u2019d heard was that the founding document was drafted on hemp paper. He sent us a couple of sources from pro-hemp organizations making that qualified claim.\nDegner referred us to Chase Milner, the Shenandoah Valley regional director of the Virginia Industrial Hemp Coalition. Milner sent us a copy of a 2010 book by Jack Herer, whom he said was \"kind of the godfather of the hemp reform movement.\" Herer, now deceased, wrote this passage in his book:\n\"The first draft of the Declaration of Independence (June 28, 1776) was written on Dutch (hemp) paper, as was the second draft completed on July 2, 1776. This was the document actually agreed to on that day and announced and released on July 4, 1776. On July 19, 1776, Congress ordered the Declaration be copied and engrossed on parchment (a prepared animal skin) and this was the document actually signed by the delegates on August 2, 1776.\"\nThere are no footnotes in Herer\u2019s book or any other indication about where the information for that passage came from.\nBut there\u2019s reason to be skeptical of the qualified claim the Declaration was drafted on hemp. Monticello says that analysis of Jefferson\u2019s original draft, \u00a0kept at the Library of Congress, was most likely written on Dutch paper.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"While hemp was commonly used to make paper in Southern Europe during this time, the Dutch were much more likely to use flax or linen rags,\" Monticello says.\nFor more insight, we reached out to The Papers of Thomas Jefferson, a Princeton University initiative that has been been compiling and publishing volumes of Jefferson\u2019s writings for decades.\n\"We concur with the information on the Monticello website, that the paper for the drafts of the Declaration would have most likely derived from linen rags, with the primary component being flax, not hemp,\" W. Bland Whitley, the associate editor of the Papers of Thomas Jefferson, wrote us in an email.\nWhitley added that Julian Boyd, the founding editor of the Papers of Thomas Jefferson, found that watermarks on the paper used for various drafts indicated they came from Holland.\nWhitley also pointed us to a 2012 University of Iowa article about early European papermaking technology. Whitley said the takeaway from the \u00a0article is that centuries ago, coarse rags and roping made from hemp mostly would have been used to make wrapping paper, rather than\u00a0writing paper.\nThe article notes early European paper-making methods from the 14th to 19th centuries included\u00a0mixing hemp and flax together to make paper. So Whitley added he couldn\u2019t completely dismiss the possibility that some hemp was used to make the paper bearing the draft Declaration.\n\"In short, we can\u2019t totally rule out that some small amount of hemp went into the manufacture of the rags that produced the paper Jefferson used for the Declaration but would argue against a definitive statement that it was hemp paper,\" Whitley wrote.\nA final note. During the debate, Goodlatte says he opposes legalizing marijuana because he feels it\u2019s a dangerous drug. But he says he\u2019s intrigued by hemp\u2019s value as economic commodity and has supported hemp research.\nOur ruling\nDegner said, \"The Declaration of Independence was written on paper made out of hemp.\"\nHe\u2019s wrong; the actual, signed version of the Declaration was written on parchment made of animal skin.\nDegner told us he meant to say that the early drafts of the Declaration were on hemp paper. But even on this, experts are highly skeptical.\nWe rate Degner\u2019s statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03960"}
