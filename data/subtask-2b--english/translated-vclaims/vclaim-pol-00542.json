In a radio interview held on 29 May at John Frederick's Fair in Portsmouth, he said: \"The phenomenon of e-sigretting has wiped out all the progress we have made in reducing youth smoking.\" We've verified the fact that battery tools have really wiped out the gains in cutting adolescent smoking. Kate Stuntz, Press Secretary of Karen, said that the Senator &apos; s statement was based on a February report on centres for disease control and prevention of tobacco use since 2011 by middle and secondary school students. The CDC concluded that \"a significant increase in the use of e-cigarette among United States youth, combined with no change in the use of other tobacco products during the period 2017-2018, has removed recent progress in reducing the overall use of tobacco products among young people.\" The CDC conducts an annual survey on tobacco use by middle and secondary school students and wonders whether they have used tobacco production in the past 30 days. According to the recent opinion poll issued in February, the use of middle schools increased from 5.6 per cent in 2017 to 7.2 per cent in 2018; among secondary school students, it rose from 19.6 per cent in 2017 to 27.1 per cent last year. Almost all the increase comes from electronic cigarett. Among middle school students, the employment rate rose from 3.3 per cent in 2017 to 4.9 per cent last year. The use of secondary school pupils almost doubled, from 11.7 per cent in 2017 to 20.8 per cent in 2018. We need to refine the statistics to examine Kane's statement. The figures for the CDC that we cited compare washing with all the applications of Baku, including chewing and chewing products. The Senator said that the use of electronic cigarett had eliminated the progress made in cutting off smoking for young people. In order to make the right comparison, we must compare the electronic cigaret used only with the toxic tobacco products. There has been success in reducing the smoking of young people. In 2011, 6.4 per cent of middle school students said they smoked in the last 30 days; this fell to 3.3 per cent last year. During the same period, the use of electronic cigaret increased eight times, from 0.6 per cent in 2011 to 4.9 per cent last year. Among secondary school students, 21.9 per cent of smokers were in 2011 and fell to 13.9 per cent last year. However, over the same period, the use of electronic segarite increased from 1.5 per cent in 2011 to 20.8 per cent last year. In secondary schools, electronic segarit oversmoking occurred in 2014 as the most common type of smoking; the same happened in middle school a year later. Did their rise erase progress in curbing the smoking of young people, as Cain says? Let us do some calculations, applying the percentages of the Centers for Disease Control to the population of public and private secondary schools in the United States, compiled by the National Centre for Education Statistics. Check the facts (Kirk Cox) was mentioned on January 13, 2021 in a speech. Virginia ranked lowest third of the states in the management of the COVID-19 vaccine. \u2022 On January 20, 2020, the CDC report began to measure it in 2011. That year, some 3.5 million high school students said that they had smoked in the last 30 days, falling to 2.3 million last year. In 2011, some 240,000 people said that they had used electronic cigaretts in the past month, and that number had risen to 3.5 million in the past year. In other words, the number of smokers in secondary schools decreased by 1.2 million, while the number of smokers using electronic segarit increased by about 3.5 million. This is more than eliminating the progress made in reducing smoking over the past seven years. However, during his radio interview, Cain did not mention the CDC report, nor did he set a date for the commencement of his claim. If you go back 20 years or more to start measuring, progress will again appear. In 1997, 36.4 per cent of secondary school students - 5.2 million - said that they had smoked at least one cigarette over the past 30 days. This exceeds 27.1 per cent - or 4.5 million students - who reported using any tobacco product last year. It should be noted that some studies have found that electronic segarit is less harmful to health than cigarette smoking because it does not produce harmful fumes. However, researchers continue to study the long-term effects of washing. The general surgeon warns that most electronic cigarettes contain nicotine, which causes addiction and can harm the brains of adolescents. Kayin has sponsored a bill with the majority leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, R-Ky, that would raise the age for buying tobacco products. This measure was referred to the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labour and Pensions. Our governor, Caine, said, \"The cybersygart survey phenomenon has wiped out all the progress we have made in curbing the smoking of young people.\" The Senator &apos; s Office told us that it was referring to a recent report by the Centre for Disease Control showing since 2011 that the growth in the use of electronic cigarett among middle and secondary school students has greatly exceeded the drop in smoking. The increase in clearance between 2017 and 2018 - the last two years of the survey - represents an eye opening in particular. However, Kane did not cite the CDC report when making comments and did not set a date to begin measuring it. If you go back to two decades or more, there is still progress in curbing tobacco use among young people. Therefore, Kane &apos; s statements are assessed as mostly true.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00542"}
