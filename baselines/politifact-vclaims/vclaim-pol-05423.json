But we\u2019ll take a look at the most basic measure of how well Americans more generally are doing income-wise -- namely, median household income, adjusted for inflation.\nAs shown in the following graph from the Federal Reserve Board of St. Louis, inflation-adjusted median household income generally rose between 1984 and 1999, then began falling starting in 1999 and 2000.\n\nSpecifically, median household income, adjusted for inflation, rose from $48,664 in 1984 to $57,843 in 1999 -- a 19 percent increase over 15 years.\nThen, over the next 15 years it fell to $53,657, a decline of 7 percent.\nSo by this measure, Clinton is correct.\nOther statistics are somewhat less clear-cut.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider the median usual weekly earnings for full-time wage and salary workers age 16 and over. Here\u2019s the St. Louis Fed\u2019s graph for that statistic:\n\nUsing this measure, wages are up slightly since 2000. That\u2019s a raise, but it\u2019s a pretty modest one of 2 percent over the past 15 years. That compares to a 6 percent increase between 1984 and 2000.\nIn one sense, wages are a reasonable yardstick to use in judging Clinton\u2019s claim, since this statistic focuses on people who are employed full-time on a wage and salary basis -- the very kind of people who would be in line to \"get a raise\" if employers were so inclined.\nOn the other hand, median household income is the broadest measure of income growth. Many households either see a share of their income in government transfer payments, such as Social Security, or from investments, rather than wages or salaries, and this income is not reflected in the the second statistic we looked at. Because median household income encompasses a wider range of income sources, it\u2019s reasonable for Clinton to base her statement on that measurement.\nOur ruling\nClinton said, \"Americans haven\u2019t had a raise in 15 years.\" Using inflation-adjusted median household income, she\u2019s right. There has actually been a decline of 7 percent over that period.\nHowever, earnings of wage and salary workers have risen over that period -- by about 2 percent. That\u2019s a tepid increase. But, it is an increase.\nOn balance, we rate Clinton\u2019s statement Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05423"}
