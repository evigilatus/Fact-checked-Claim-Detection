Yet estimates vary surrounding the level to which it will increase.\nOne study from 2014 in the academic journal Agricultural\u00a0Economics stated food demand might increase by 59 percent to 98 percent between 2005 and 2050. Another study contributed to the National Academy of Sciences in 2011 said crop demand might rise by 100 to 110 percent between 2005 and 2050.\nThose estimates are close to the increase of 50 percent to 97 percent Spicer mentioned, though Spicer\u2019s claim didn\u2019t specify a start date for his projection. (We asked for clarification but didn\u2019t get a response.) The start date matters, because if it\u2019s 2017 -- as a casual listener would probably assume -- then Spicer\u2019s estimate is likely too high.\nHarry Kaiser, a Cornell University professor and an expert in food demand, said about a 39 percent increase in global food demand seemed more accurate (though he said other factors, like global changes in diet, might contribute to a higher estimate). He calculated that figure based on projected increases in population multiplied by projected increases in per-capita food demand using 2012 data from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\"Bottom line: This is way lower than Spicer\u2019s claim of between 50 to 90 percent growth in world food demand by 2050,\" he said.\nRichard Waite, an associate from from the World Resources Institute\u2019s Food Program also told us that Spicer\u2019s estimate was too high.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe explained that forecasts of this nature \"can be a little misleading\" \u00a0because the base year for frequently used data is often in the past. Waite estimated a roughly 45 percent increase in food demand from 2017, but noted that it was a fairly common \"mistake\"\u00a0to use projected figures from 2006 in the way Spicer did. The World Resources Institute estimated about a 70 percent increase in global food demand between 2006 and 2050.\nReasons for increasing global food demand\nSeveral factors impact rates of global food demand: growth in population and income are two of the most important ones.\nEstimates show the projected world population will be around 9.6 billion by 2050, up from roughly 7.5 billion currently, and per-capita income is expected to rise to 1.8 times what it was in 2012. \nPopulation increases the number of mouths to feed, while income growth tends to increase the amount of calories the people eat. Income increases can also create a shift in diet as lower-income individuals may have better access to protein-heavy foods like livestock and fish as their incomes rise.\nFor example, the World Resources Institute expects a 23 percent global increase in consumption of livestock and cattle between\u00a02006 to 2050. \nOur ruling\nSpicer said that global food demand would increase by 50 to 98 percent by 2050. Recent projections agree with general thrust of his forecast, but it seems likely that Spicer\u2019s claim is a little too high to be completely on target. We rate the claim Mostly True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/8e0ffe0c-c964-466d-8119-10dd50b67863", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03504"}
