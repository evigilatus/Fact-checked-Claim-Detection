Five veteran Republicans published a joint newsletter critical of the Hollow. The Tony Evers budget proposes to allow non-national migrants to pay tuition fees in the states throughout the University of Wisconsin system and government technical colleges. On March 12, 2019, the State Republic of Jesse James, Ken Skoronsky, Jim Ott, John Spyros and Tony Kurtz said that immigrants would be given a three-year education break, while veterans would have to wait five years. Republican leaders took the case on Twitter, including the President of the Robin Vos Society and the President of the Assembly, Majority Jim Steinke. Under (Goff) The Tony Evers budget, undocumented immigrants will qualify for education in the country two years ago from our veterans, \"Steinke said, R-Cocona on March 12, 2019, Tweed. All the news and tweeting bulletins included drawings entitled \"The Beautiful Print\" attributed to the Wisconsin GOP Society. In public education for non-United States citizens after 3 years in WI. (Warriors must wait five years) \" Did the Republicans get their good prints right? Not quite. Let us verify the educational benefits available to both groups. Differences in benefits for veterans and immigrants. graphs claimed by non-United States citizens can pay education in the country after three years, but veterans must wait five years to receive those benefits. The first problem: Graphics combine two different types of programs. According to the budget proposal of Evers, citizens of other countries living in Wisconsin will be able to pay education fees in the state if they graduate from the Wisconsin high school, live in the state for at least three years before applying for university and prove that they have submitted or will apply for a permanent residence visa, according to a memorandum prepared by the non-partisan legislative financial office, the Veterans Program cited for exemption from education. This is it, paying tuition fees. Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" \u2022 January 26, 2012, under the program, veterans can cover all their tuition fees up to eight semesters if they meet certain conditions, according to the memo. The requirements include serving for at least two years under \"honorary circumstances,\" maintaining 2.0 GPA and being a resident in Wisconsin. Veterans are eligible for exemption after using their educational entitlements under the Public Occupation Bill. Here is an important point: veterans who lived in Wisconsin when they entered the service receive school funding immediately. There's no waiting at all. Those who moved to Wisconsin after their service must live here five years before receiving funding. Therefore, the wait is five years for one category of veterans and three years for undocumented immigrants, the number of Republicans on whom they focus. But many veterans get the greatest benefits without waiting. In the school year 2017-18, more than 3,300 veterans received their tuition fees through the UW exemption programme or the State Technical College system, according to the Financial Office. We are not aware of any background data on veterans before they apply for interest, but they are likely to be immediately qualified as residents more than those who have faced a five-year waiting period. The tweetings were deleted, and the amendment of the problematic news comparison between the two programmes led the Republicans to retreat from their initial baldness. All tweets comparing drop-out periods were deleted from Vos, Steineke and GOP Assembly a few hours after publication. The Republican Veterans News Bulletin has been amended to show a new image. Foss and Steinke's employees said the tweets were removed because the drawings were \"new.\" Recent news bulletins - and subsequent tweets from Republican legislators - the reference to veterans in \"Beautiful Printing\" changed to \"non-resident veterans must wait five years before exemption.\" The new version thus makes it clear that it refers to \"non-resident\" veterans and mentions exemption. But it still has a comparison based on two different programs with very different benefits. Our classification of the graphs that appeared in the news and tweet from a group of Republicans - many of which were deleted or subsequently updated - claimed that the people of Wisconsin, who are not citizens, could receive education in the state in three years, but veterans must wait five years. The claim is dismissed on several counts. The benefits available to veterans are not deducted from education fees in the State, but fully cover all tuition fees. Waiting for five years applies only to veterans who move to the state after the end of their term of office, not to all veterans. Many will receive the greatest benefits without waiting. In our view, the original allegation contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that give a different impression. That's what we often call wrong.
