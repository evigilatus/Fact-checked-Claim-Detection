The report breaks that job tally into three categories.\nIt says 42,638 jobs were directly involved in the oil and natural gas industry. That includes the expected extraction and production jobs and \u2013 as we will get to in a moment \u2013 a total of 29,146 jobs at gas stations with and without convenience stores.\nIf that were the only category, those jobs would account for just 0.8 percent of all Georgia jobs.\nBut the report classifies another 33,502 workers as indirectly involved in the oil and gas industry, or with positions in activities in outside industries that supply those fields.\nDrew Lyon, principal and leader of the national economics and statistics group at PwC and the author of the report, said care was taken to eliminate double counts so that some suppliers who would have been in the direct jobs tally were removed.\nThen the largest number of jobs -- 65,490 -- are counted as \"induced\" jobs. Lyon said those are the positions that are created to meet the demand from the spending of employees in the direct and indirect jobs.\nIn that category, the general \"service\" field has by far the most indirect and induced jobs, with 43,349 workers \u2013 or 711 more employees than work directly for the oil and natural gas industries.\nConsidering those jobs are apt to be in professional services, healthcare, education and the like \u2013 all known powerhouses in metro Atlanta\u2019s economy -- those numbers are not surprising.\nAnd to Lyon, they show how many of those back office jobs -- say in human resources -- owe their existence to an industry thought of as minor in the Peach State.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Boysko\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in a committee debate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe United States is the only industrialized, modernized country that does not already have a paid family medical leave program in place.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It\u2019s no surprise, for example, that a significant amount of employment in Texas is directly related to oil and gas,\" Lyon said. \"But it\u2019s of interest in how other states, either as suppliers to in-state or out-of-state producers, or through some of these other industries, are impacted by the oil and gas industry.\"\nTaken together, that brings the total to 141,600 jobs, or 2.7 percent of the Georgia workforce.\nBut is it fair to count all of those jobs, knowing that two thirds of the positions in question are outside the oil and gas industries?\nBruce Seaman, an economist at Georgia State\u2019s Andrew Young School of Policy Studies, said he was not troubled with the methodology of the study.\nThe report took care not to count jobs twice and also used commonly accepted input-output models to show the known relationships between industries (Basically, the output from one industry become inputs in another but must be adjusted not to exaggerate the impact).\nThat said, Seaman wondered about the service station employees, who primarily are not working as pump attendants or mechanics. Especially at stations with stores, those workers are apt to run the cash registers, do janitorial work or even cook.\n\"Those jobs are more accurately convenience store retail jobs,\" Seaman said.\nThe BLS codes back up that assessment, listing those positions as retail, versus the mining or production jobs expected in oil and gas.\nLyon said PwC included those gas station positions as a best estimate of companies and jobs that exist only because of the gas and oil industry.\nReid Porter, a spokesman at API, agreed, adding \"What happens in the oil and natural gas industry reverberates throughout the entire economy.\"\nOur ruling\nThe American Petroleum Institute recently released a series of press releases, drawing attention to the economic impact of the oil and gas industry on every state.\nGeorgia, it said, has 141,600 jobs provided or supported by oil and gas.\nA 2011 report by PricewaterhouseCoopers backs up the number by looking at direct positions in the industry, supportive jobs and, accounting for most of the workers, all of the positions created from the industry and its supply chain.\nThe math and economics are right \u2013 to a point. But careful examination of the report shows that 68 percent of the jobs counted as directly working in the oil and gas industry could just as easily be classified as retail workers.\nAdjusting the base number up by 29,146 workers, then, amplifies the number of jobs that support the industry or caters to its whims.\nThe report is clear that it counts those positions, though. And the claim takes care to say the industry \"supports\" that large number of workers.\nIt\u2019s accurate, but somewhat misleading. We rate the claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05850"}
