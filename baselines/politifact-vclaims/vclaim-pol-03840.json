So we examined the records and found three statements by Obama that decimate Pratt\u2019s claim.\nDallas\nOn the night of July 7, 2016, a sniper killed five Dallas policemen and wounded seven in the deadliest attack for police since 9/11. The assassin, before dying at the scene, said he was angered by the fatal police shootings of black men in Louisiana and Minnesota that had dominated national news in previous days.\nObama denounced the sniper\u2019s acts the next morning as \"a vicious, calculated and despicable attack on law enforcement.\" He added, \"I believe that I speak for every single American when I say that we are horrified over these events and that we stand united with the people and the police department in Dallas.\"\nThe president also said, \"There is no possible justification for these kinds of attacks or any violence against law enforcement.\"\nObama was in Europe at the time to attend a NATO Summit and to hold meetings with leaders in Poland and in Spain. He cut short the trip by one day to speak at a memorial service in Dallas for the slain policemen.\nBaton Rouge\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThree Baton Rouge law enforcement officers were ambushed and shot to death on July, 17, 2016. The assassin, who was killed at the scene, had vowed in an email to avenge the recent police killings of blacks.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObama issued a statement that day that said, \"For the second time in two weeks, police officers who put their lives on the line for ours every day were doing their job when they were killed in a cowardly and reprehensible assault. These are attacks on public servants, on the rule of law, and on civilized society, and they have to stop.\"\nNew York\nTwo New York City policemen sitting in their patrol car were shot at point blank range on Dec. 20, 2014. \u00a0The New York Times reported that the murderer, who committed suicide near the scene, had made statements on social media that he planned to avenge police killings of black men earlier that year in Ferguson, Mo. and New York.\nObama issued a written statement that day that actually used the word \"condemn.\" He wrote:\n\"I unconditionally condemn today's murder of two police officers in New York City. Two brave men won't be going home to their loved ones tonight, and for that, there is no justification. The officers who serve and protect our communities risk their own safety for ours every single day - and they deserve our respect and gratitude every single day. Tonight, I ask people to reject violence and words that harm, and turn to words that heal - prayer, patient dialogue, and sympathy for the friends and family of the fallen.\"\nWe asked Pratt if he had second thoughts about his comment about Obama.\n\"Nah,\" he replied, saying the president\u2019s statements deploring the attacks on police have been tempered by other comments Obama has made legitimizing the distrust many blacks have of police officers. For example, Obama said on July 7, 2016, that while most police perform admirably, there are racial \"biases, some conscious and unconscious, that have to be rooted out.\"\nPratt told us that Obama \"has stirred the pot,\" on attacking police. \"He\u2019s looking for division.\"\nWe should finally note that Pratt is not the first to accuse Obama of being aloof about the attacks on police. Our colleagues at PunditFact on July 8, 2016, examined a similar comment by William Johnson, executive director of the National Association of Police Officers. They rated it Pants on Fire. \u00a0\nOur ruling\nPratt said Obama never \"condemned\" murders targeting police.\nHis outrageous statement ignores the president\u2019s expressions of abhorrence following each of three different ambush murders of multiple police officers in the last two years. \u00a0Obama publicly called the killings \"vicious,\" \"reprehensible,\" \"cowardly,\" and \"despicable.\" \u00a0Following the 2014 slaying of two New York policemen, Obama used the very word Pratt denies him, saying, \"I unconditionally condemn\" the murders.\nWe rate Pratt\u2019s claim Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03840"}
