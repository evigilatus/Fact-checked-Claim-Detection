That was one of the goals that the president had when he pushed the crime bill that was passed in 1994.\"\nProvisions of the act included a ban on some assault weapons, more funding for community policing and an expansion of the death penalty. The legislation, which was championed by Bill Clinton as a way to reduce the number of African-Americans being killed in drug-related incidents, has drawn criticism in recent years for sending disproportionate numbers of African-Americans to prison.\nThe \"superpredator\" remark, which Priebus and Trump referenced, was in the same speech a few lines later.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But we also have to have an organized effort against gangs,\" Hillary Clinton \u00a0said in a C-SPAN video clip. \"Just as in a previous generation we had an organized effort against the mob. We need to take these people on. They are often connected to big drug cartels, they are not just gangs of kids anymore. They are often the kinds of kids that are called superpredators \u2014 no conscience, no empathy. We can talk about why they ended up that way, but first, we have to bring them to heel.\"\nThe full context of this incident does link children and superpredators, but nowhere in the speech does she directly label African-American youth this way.\nHowever, backlash from this speech has followed Clinton into this year\u2019s election. Two Black Lives Matter activists confronted Clinton at a private fundraiser in February, telling the candidate she owes black people an apology.\nOne day after this confrontation, Clinton released a statement to the Washington Post\u2019s Jonathan Capehart, expressing regret for her word choice.\n\"Looking back, I shouldn't have used those words, and I wouldn't use them today,\" she said.\nLater in the election cycle, former Democratic opponent, Bernie Sanders, also criticized her language at a debate in Brooklyn. When Sanders was asked by debate moderator why he called out Bill Clinton out for his defense of Clinton\u2019s use of the term \"superpredator,\" Sanders responded, \"Because it was a racist term, and everyone knew it was a racist term.\"\nOur ruling\nPriebus\u00a0said Hillary Clinton is \"the the one that labeled African-American youth as superpredators.\"\nClinton \u2014 in the midst of championing her husband\u2019s 1994 crime legislation \u2014 did use the term \"superpredator\" when referring to \"gangs of kids.\" She did not specifically label superpredators as African-American, but the context of her speech and her subsequent apology decades later suggests it was a reasonable inference.\nPriebus\u2019 claim is accurate, but needs some clarification, so for that reason we rate his statement Mostly True.\n Share the Facts   Politifact    2 7  Politifact Rating: Mostly True  Says Hillary Clinton \"is the one that labeled African-American youth as \u2018superpredators.\u2019\"    Reince Priebus RNC Chairman   In an interview on NBC's Meet the Press Sunday, August 28, 2016 08/28/2016    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04408"}
