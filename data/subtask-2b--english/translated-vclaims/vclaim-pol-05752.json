For the record, the Trans-Pacific Partnership includes Asian States, but not China. However, Trump said, \"We are losing more than $500 billion a year in terms of imbalance with China. Last month in an election campaign in Sioux Falls, Iowa, Trump said, \"We have approximately $400 billion in trade imbalance with China.\" Jumping over $100 billion in less than a month? Really? No. We contacted the Trump campaign to get more information on this form, but we didn't hear a response. However, according to census office data, the United States trade deficit with China was $343 billion in 2014. That makes Trump fall back by more than 31%. For comparison, the $343 billion trade gap is almost the total gross domestic product (GDP) of Denmark. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 As at 11 January 2021, the 2015 trade deficit had so far been calculated as of September 2015, with a total deficit of approximately $274 billion. During the last 12 months of available data, the total trade deficit was $364 billion. This is a huge deficit, but not more than $500 billion, as Trump said. Since 1986, the annual trade deficit of the United States with China has increased from year to year with the exception of 2001 and 2009. See our schedule for further information. Our Governor Trump said, \"We are losing more than $500 billion a year in terms of imbalance with China. Last month, Trump said approximately $400 billion during a speech in Iowa. He had to hold on to that number. The 2014 trade deficit totalled $343 billion, and is expected to be larger in 2015 but not more than $500 billion. Tramp's claim rates are mostly false.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05752"}
