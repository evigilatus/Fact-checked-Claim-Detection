John Nygren hits pay dirt with property tax claim", "text": "Many homeowners are currently receiving receipts stamped \"Paid\" in the mail for their 2018 property tax bills.\nWhether the bill goes up or down each year is of paramount importance to homeowners.\nSo politicians are also eager to weigh in on the issue.\n\"Today, property taxes are lower than they were in 2010. Allowing taxpaying to keep more of their hard-earned money has been and will continue to be a top priority,\" state Rep. John Nygren, R-Marinette, said Jan. 11, 2019 in a tweet.\nProperty taxes are levied on most types of real estate -- including homes, businesses, and parcels of land. The amount owed depends on the fair market value of the property, as determined by the local assessor.\nIs Nygren right?\nAre property taxes lower today than they were in 2010?\nThe evidence\nThe year 2010, of course, is not an arbitrary starting point.\nIt marks the year Republican Scott Walker was elected governor and when the GOP won full control of the Legislature. Democrat Tony Evers is now in the governor\u2019s office, after topping Walker in the 2018 election.\nWhen asked for backup to the claim, Nygren\u2019s chief of staff Nathan Schwanz\npointed to a January 2019 report from the Legislative Fiscal Bureau on median property tax payments in the state.\nThe nonpartisan fiscal bureau is considered the gold-standard on such financial and budget issues. Here is its breakdown for the years in question:\n2010 - 2011-- $2,963\n2011- 2012 -- $2,953\n2012 - 2013 -- $2,943\n2013 - 2014 -- $2,926\n2014 - 2015 -- $2,831\n2015 - 2016 -- $2,849\n2016 - 2017 -- $2,852\n2017 - 2018 -- $2,876\n2018 - 2019 -- $2,870 (preliminary estimate)\n\u00a0\nSo, the 2018-19 total is, indeed, lower than the 2010-11 total.\nThe fiscal bureau regularly does such estimates, and they are routinely cited by politicians of both stripes.\n\nBut it\u2019s important to note they are an illustration -- some people's property taxes went down, some went up. Even if your home value was right at the statewide average, your tax bill might have been higher due to various factors, including levies in individual communities.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Steineke\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembly Republicans \u201chave come to the table\u201d and were part of \u201cgive and take\u201d compromise on a coronavirus bill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPast ratings\nMeanwhile, we have checked variations of this claim in the past:\n*July 15, 2015: Walker claimed that because of his actions, property taxes were lower than they were four years earlier. Walker\u2019s actions to limit the ability of local governments and school districts to raise levies played a major role. But we found the lower property taxes to that point were also due in part to declines in housing values.\nOur rating: Mostly True.\n*Jan. 13, 2017, Walker said property taxes -- as a percentage of personal income -- were \"the lowest that they've been since the end of World War II\" An analysis by the nonpartisan Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance showed that on the measure Walker cited, they were lowest since 1946.\nOur rating: True.\n*June 7, 2017, after a \"lower than 2010\" claim from Walker, we wrote that fiscal bureau estimates of the hypothetical property tax on a median-valued home found the tax was indeed lower. That time we found the drop in residential property taxes was due to commercial and manufacturing properties rising at a faster rate -- not due to collecting less revenue.\nOur rating: Mostly True.\nFinally, we also used the Walk-O-Meter to monitor a promise by Walker to continue to reduce the tax burden on working families and seniors every year he was in office. This, of course, applied to all taxes -- not just property taxes.\nWe rated the pledge Promise Kept. \u00a0\nAre there any wrinkles this time? Yes.\nAccording to the fiscal bureau, the change over the latest two years -- from 2017-18 to 2018-19 -- is a net decrease for homeowners, even though the gross tax bill is projected to increase.\nWhat\u2019s behind the difference? Funding for the lottery and gaming property tax credit increased by about $66 million, which contributed to the decrease in the median net tax bill. \u00a0\nWhere Wisconsin ranks\nTo be sure, Wisconsin property taxes remain among the highest in the United States. Various property tax trackers place Wisconsin in the top 10, sometimes in the top five.\nThe personal finance website WalletHub analyzed data from the U.S. Census Bureau for all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The website also used rates to obtain the dollar amount paid in real estate taxes on a median-valued home in each state.\nIt ranked Wisconsin as the fifth worst state for property taxes. With the median home value sitting at $167,000, the typical tax bill comes to $3,257, according to WalletHub. Filling out the rest of the top five for 2018 were:\n\u00a0\nMedian Home value \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Taxes\n\n\nNew Jersey: $316,400\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 $7,601\n\n\nIllinois: \u00a0$174,800\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 $4,058\n\n\nNew Hampshire: $239,700\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0$5,241\n\n\nConnecticut: $269,300 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 $5,443\n\n\nWisconsin: $167,000\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 $3,257\n\n\nBut Nygren\u2019s claim was not about the state\u2019s rank. So that does not factor into our rating.\nOur rating\nNygren said \"today, property taxes are lower than they were in 2010.\"\nData from the Legislative Fiscal Bureau shows the statement generally rings true. But there have long been wrinkles on these claims -- from declining property values driving the drop to an increase in commercial and manufacturing property values shifting the burden from homeowners.\nThose sorts of factors are still in play, this time with tax credits contributing to latest decrease.\nAnd the rating is still Mostly True.\nShare the Facts2019-02-08 21:47:06 UTCPolitiFact517PolitiFact Rating: Mostly True\"Today, property taxes are lower than they were in 2010.\"John NygrenState Representativehttps://twitter.com/rep89/status/1083793162034761728TwitterFriday, January 11, 20192019-01-11Read Moreinfo", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01045"}
