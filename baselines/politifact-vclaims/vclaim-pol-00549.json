The only problem is ...\u00a0 the photo is only of the claim that Snopes researched, not the conclusion.\nThe screenshot shows Snopes\u2019 URL and the claim, which reads: \"November 2018 marked the first Veterans Day in 56 years upon which a sitting U.S. president did not attend a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Arlington National Cemetery.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe screenshot conveniently cuts off right before the Snopes rating \u2013 which, of course, you already likely know is False. There is no mention of the \"False\" rating or all the reasons why that fact-checking organization determined this claim is completely wrong.\nAccording to the Snopes article, it is accurate that Trump did not attend a wreath-laying ceremony at Arlington on Veterans Day in 2018, but he was nowhere near the \"first sitting U.S. president in 56 years\" to do so.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral presidents have not attended the ceremony at one time or another.

Bush was not present in 1989, 1990 and 1992.\nSince 1989, President Bill Clinton is the only one to have attended the event all eight years of his presidency.\nOur ruling\nA viral image on social media claims that president Trump was the \"first\" sitting U.S. president who did not attend the wreath-laying ceremony at Arlington Cemetery on Veterans Day 2018.\nIt is accurate that Trump was elsewhere that day, but he is not the first president to be absent from the event. Three out of the four presidents who preceded Trump observed the holiday elsewhere.\nThis screenshot is a blatantly inaccurate and incomplete depiction of a fact-check.\nWe rate it Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00549"}
