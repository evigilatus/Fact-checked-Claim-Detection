Germany has won praise for its early and aggressive testing-and-tracing response to the pandemic. The United States has not.\nWith that in mind, we wondered: Are these countries so similar? And are they really the \"two best\"?\nWe contacted the White House to find out the basis for the president\u2019s statement and never heard back. But of all the datasets tracking COVID-19 deaths, none supports anything near Trump\u2019s assertion.\nAnd when you look at the numbers on which experts rely, Trump\u2019s claim is at best misleading. The United States\u2019 rate of COVID deaths per capita is better than many countries \u2014 but in no universe is it one of \"the two best.\"\nThe numbers\nDeaths per 100,000 people \u2014 the per capita metric Trump used \u2014 is generally considered a valuable public health measure that helps quantify the intensity of an epidemic. In this situation, it tracks how many people have died from COVID-19 in relation to countries\u2019 populations.\nIt\u2019s an imperfect measure, to be sure. Globally, COVID-19 deaths are typically undercounted, since countries aren\u2019t testing all the people who have been infected, let alone counting all deaths attributed to the virus. And comparing the numbers gets trickier when you place countries like Germany, which has tested large swaths of the population, against the United States, which has not.\nBut even when comparing apples with oranges, Trump\u2019s claim inflated just how well the United States has performed.\n\"It is not supported by the facts,\" said Jennifer Kates, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe looked at four credible estimates, all of which were recommended by health researchers: Johns Hopkins University\u2019s coronavirus death count, along with global estimates published by the Kaiser Family Foundation, Our World in Data and Worldometer. (Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation.)\nThe Hopkins death count estimates that, in the United States, 24.66 people per 100,000 have died of COVID-19, as of May 12. In Germany, meanwhile, the rate is 9.24 \u2014 meaning the American death rate is 2.5 times that of Germany. And that\u2019s only part of the issue.\nWhen compared with many other countries \u2014 including Canada, South Korea, Iran, Russia, Poland and Switzerland \u2014 the U.S. numbers don\u2019t do very well. \"We have higher levels of deaths per capita than [those] countries and many others,\" said Jeffrey Shaman, a professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia University.\nThat\u2019s true no matter the dataset. The United States performs better than countries like Spain and Italy, but still far worse than Germany and worse than numerous other countries.\nIn fact, per Our World in Data\u2019s estimates, the United States\u2019 rate of COVID-19 deaths per capita isn\u2019t just worse than what we see in countries like Canada and South Korea. It\u2019s also worse than the global average. As of May 12, 36.66 per million people had died of COVID for the entire world \u2014 in the United States, it was 243.76 deaths per million people.\nThere is another way to look at the numbers, Kates said. Instead of the cumulative number of people who have died per capita since the pandemic began, one can consider whether the United States is performing better when it comes to recent deaths. If American numbers were similar to that of Germany within a specific window of time, it would suggest that the United States is approaching a similar point in efforts to alleviate the crisis.\nEven then, the United States falls short. As of May 12, numerous countries, including Canada, France, Germany, Russia and Italy, had fewer daily deaths per capita based on a seven-day average than did the U.S. \u2014 suggesting that the risks here are still greater than they are in those nations.\nSo, big picture? It is misleading to suggest the United States and Germany are in the same league, especially when it comes to COVID deaths per capita. It\u2019s flat-out untrue to suggest that the United States is one of the \"two best,\" when countless other nations are seeing far lower death rates per 100,000 people.\n\"The claim is false,\" Shaman said.\nOur ruling\nTrump claimed that, when it comes to COVID-19 fatalities, \"Germany and the United States are the two best in deaths per 100,000 people.\"\nThis is untrue. While the metric Trump highlighted is important, there are countless countries performing far better than the United States on COVID deaths per capita. And it is misleading at best to categorize the American fatality count in the same group as Germany\u2019s; Germany\u2019s numbers are better.\nWe rate this claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18294"}
