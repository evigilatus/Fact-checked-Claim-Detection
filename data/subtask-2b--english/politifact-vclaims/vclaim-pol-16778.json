(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nThe photo is real, though we wouldn\u2019t describe the people in it as crying. AFP photographer Nicholas Kamm took it on Nov. 9, 2016, as U.S. National Security Adviser Susan Rice and White House communications director Jen Psaki, among others, listened to Obama address the nation after Donald Trump\u2019s election.\nThe Facebook post points to the man to the far right of the photo and describes him as the whistleblower who alleged Trump is soliciting foreign interference from Ukraine in the 2020 election.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe whistleblower has legal protection from retaliation and U.S. officials have kept that person\u2019s name confidential. Most news organizations have also withheld the name, though, as the Washington Post reports, the name of a CIA officer has appeared widely on social media as posts claim to out him as the whistleblower.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nBut it\u2019s not R. David Edelman, the man in this photo. On Nov. 7, he tweeted another image claiming that he\u2019s the whistleblower. \"Here\u2019s a picture of the \u2018whistleblower\u2019 see the \u2018NERD\u2019 in the picture...his face is circled,\" it said.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"FAKE NEWS,\" Edelman tweeted, \" the \u2018NERD\u2019 circled below is the whistleblower. TRUE (just not news): the \u2018NERD\u2019 circled below is...this nerd. Me. Left government in 2017. Sorry to disappoint, y\u2019all.\"\u00a0\n\"This photo was on the cover of @washingtonpost, people,\" he added. \"Seriously, even conspiracy theories deserve a quick google fact check.\"\nBefore he left government in January 2017, Edelman was a special assistant to the president for economic and technology policy, leading policy development and coordination on issues related to the digital economy, according to a White House bio. He also served as senior advisor for internet, innovation and privacy at the Office of Science and Technology Policy, and he was the first director of international cyber policy at the White House National Security Council.\u00a0\nHe\u2019s included on the 2016 annual report to Congress listing White House office personnel and their pay. But his name doesn\u2019t appear on the June 30, 2017, report.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s because on March 3, 2017, MIT announced that Edelman was joining its internet policy research initiative. As director of the school\u2019s project on technology, the economy and national security, he leads the initiative\u2019s AI policy research.\u00a0\nBut the whistleblower complaint that led to the U.S. House impeachment inquiry details recent government work, describing \"official duties,\" \"official interagency business\" and colleagues \u2014 U.S. officials, not academics.\u00a0\nWe rate this Facebook post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16778"}
