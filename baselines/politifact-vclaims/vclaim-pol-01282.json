The Post story concerns comments she made in an interview with CNN that month that prompted the allegations of racism. \u00a0\nDuring the interview, CNN anchor Poppy Harlow notes that Brewer is a rarity in \"the corner office\" as a minority, female CEO.\n\"Where do you fall on who has to make the change and how it is going to happen so that there are more women like you represented in the top echelons of corporate America?\" Harlow then asks.\nBrewer says it has to start with the top leadership at a company. \"My executive team is very diverse, and I make that a priority. I demand it of my team and within the structure. And then, every now and then, you have to nudge your partners, and you have to speak up and speak out. And I try to use my platform for that. \u2026 I try to set an example. I mentor many women inside my company and outside the company because I think it\u2019s important.\"\nBrewer then agrees with Harlow that diversity is important in hiring for top positions at a company. \u00a0\"And I talk to my suppliers about it. Just today I met with a supplier, and the entire other side of the table was all Caucasian males. That was interesting,\" Brewer says. \"I decided not to talk about it directly with the folks in the room because there were actually no females, like, levels down. So I\u2019m going to place a call to him.\"\nHer remarks led to hashtags like #boycottsamsclub and #boycottracistsamsclub, according to the Post. But while the comments may have been controversial, they don\u2019t indicate that she thinks white men are \"evil\" or \"the root of all evil.\"\nWe rate this post Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01282"}
