Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, in the Capitol.\u00a0\nMurkowski appears to be standing in a doorway while Feinstein leans toward her with a hand pressed against the wall by the Alaska senator\u2019s head. Their exchange was inaudible, the Hill reported, but they appeared to be on good terms, hugging when they met and then stepping aside to whisper to each other.\u00a0\nNearly three years later, the image is being recast as a recent interaction as senators now grapple with the Supreme Court vacancy left since Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died on Sept. 18.\u00a0\n\"Feinstein caught on camera bullying Murkowski,\" reads the headline of a Sept. 21 blog post that\u2019s being shared on social media.\u00a0\nIt was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

And, oh yes, the President himself has said his list is made up of five women. With this in mind, Feinstein cornered Murkowski \u2014\u00a0literally physically.\"\nBack in 2018, Murkowski voted against Kavanaugh. And on Sept. 20 of this year, the day before this blog post was published, Murkowski announced that she would not support filling Ginsburg\u2019s seat before the presidential election.\u00a0\n\"For weeks, I have stated that I would not support taking up a potential Supreme Court vacancy this close to the election,\" she said in a statement. \"Sadly, what was then a hypothetical is now a reality, but my position has not changed.\"\u00a0\nThe photo in this blog post is authentic, though we don\u2019t know what, exactly, was happening as Feinstein and Murkowski huddled together in 2018. But the post wrongly gives the impression that this is a recent interaction connected to the political fight over whether to fill Ginsburg\u2019s seat on the court before the election. It\u2019s not.
