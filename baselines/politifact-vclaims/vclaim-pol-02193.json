Austin, Sam Houston only ones holding a gun or sword", "text": "A fundraising email staked a claim to uniqueness about Texans in the U.S. Capitol that made us wonder.\nJonathan Saenz, who heads Texas Values, a group that says it\u2019s dedicated to faith, family and freedom, wrote March 28, 2018, that\u00a0during a recent walk through the U.S. Capitol, \"I gazed up at the carvings and paintings that tell America\u2019s glorious story\u2026 smiling that Stephen F. Austin\u2019s and Sam Houston\u2019s statues were the only ones holding a rifle or a sword. I was reminded about the truth of all that\u2019s exceptional about America and Texas.\"\nThat kind of historical trivia seems tailor-made for our Texas Truth-O-Meter.\nTourists visiting Washington, D.C., learn that the Capitol houses 100 statues, two donated by each state. According to the Architect of the Capitol, which is the steward of the landmark buildings and grounds of Capitol Hill, such statues were confined to the building\u2019s National Statuary Hall until Congress in 1933 reacted to overcrowding--at the time, 65 statues were wedged three-deep into the hall--by authorizing the statues to be spread throughout the building, which extends to the Capitol Visitor Center.\nWe scrolled online through the architect office\u2019s posted photos of the 100 statues. Could it be that only Austin and Houston were carved holding a gun or sword?\nAustin\u2019s statue has a long gun front and center, it looked to us, while Houston\u2019s statue just barely appeared to have a sword to its left rear side.\nBut our click-through of photos of the Capitol statues showed that Houston wasn\u2019t the only one holding a sword. (A fair number of others, we saw, hold books.)\nList of statues holding weapons\nWhen we sought expert help, a curator from the Capitol architect\u2019s office, Jennifer Blancato, emailed us a list of Capitol statues holding weapons \u2014 with a notation that the Austin statue alone holds a firearm, which she listed as a rifle.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJake Tapper\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in remarks in a CNN broadcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second presidential impeachment of Donald Trump was \u201cthe most bipartisan impeachment in American history.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlancato listed 12 Capitol statues--including the one of Houston--of men holding swords.\nSimilarly, William C. diGiacomantonio, chief historian of the U.S. Capitol Historical Society, which was chartered by Congress in the 1960s to educate the public on the Capitol\u2019s history and heritage, responded by email that the Capitol statue of Austin is the only one brandishing a musket or rifle while, he said, many Capitol statues hold swords.\nBlancato specified as the sword-holding statues: Houston; Gen. Joseph Wheeler of Alabama; Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith of Florida; Gen. James Shield of Illinois; John Stark of New Hampshire; Philip Kearney of New Jersey; John Peter Gabriel Muhlenberg of Pennsylvania; Nathanael Greene of \u00a0Rhode Island; John Sevier of Tennessee; Ethan Allen of Vermont; Robert E. Lee of Virginia; and Gen. Ulysses S. Grant. (Blancato otherwise said the statues of King Kamehameha I of Hawaii and Chief Washakie of Wyoming hold spears.)\nWe shared Blancato\u2019s break-out with Saenz who said in an emailed statement that he based his claim about the Texas statues on what he noticed while at the Capitol, perhaps \"because my focus is always primarily on Texas.\"\nOur ruling\nSaenz said the Capitol statues of Austin and Houston are \"the only ones holding a rifle or a sword.\"\nThis proud Texan's claim has an element of truth in that Austin\u2019s rifle-bearing statue alone holds a rifle.\u00a0 However, a dozen statues donated by states, including the one of Houston, hold swords.\nWe rate this statement\u00a0Mostly False.\n\nMOSTLY FALSE \u2013 The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.
