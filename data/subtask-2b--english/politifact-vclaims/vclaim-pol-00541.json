Ilhan Omar's claim is high: There aren't 500 gun deaths per day in the US, it's closer to 100", "text": "U.S. Rep. Lucy McBath of Georgia, who became a gun-control advocate after her 17-year-old son was shot to death, tweeted on June 5 that she was praying the U.S. Senate would adopt the House-passed Bipartisan Background Checks Act.\nThat drew a retweet from a Democratic colleague, Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, who added this statement:\n\"Supporting my colleagues\u2019 call on Senate Majority Leader to vote on H.R. 8, 1112 & 1158. Gun violence is an epidemic. Every day on average 500 people die from gun violence. How many more lives will we let gun violence claim?\"\nAt 500 per day, that would be 182,500 deaths per year from gun violence in the United States.\nThe actual figure is nowhere near that high.\nThe legislation\nThe legislation (H.R. 8) would establish new background check requirements for firearm transfers between private parties. Transfers would be prohibited unless a licensed gun dealer, manufacturer, or importer first takes possession of the firearm to conduct a background check. There would be some exceptions, such as a gift between spouses.\nCurrently, only federally licensed gun dealers, importers and manufacturers are required to conduct a background check for someone seeking to obtain a gun.\nThe House, which is controlled by Democrats, passed the bill 240-190 in February 2019. National Public Radio reported then that passage in the Republican-majority Senate is unlikely. The White House has signaled that President Donald Trump would veto the legislation, which is opposed by the NRA. And Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has declined to take up the bill.\nThe numbers\nWhen we last examined the numbers, earlier this year, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported there had been 39,773 deaths related to firearms in 2017. 2017 is still the most recent year for which annual statistics from the CDC are available.\nThe figure counts deaths resulting from suicides (60 percent of the total), homicides, unintentional and undetermined deaths, as well as those from law enforcement. And it was the highest tally in at least 40 years.\nMeanwhile, the average over five years \u2014 2013 through 2017 \u00a0\u2014 is slightly lower, according to Brady, the nonprofit formerly known as the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.\nEither way, the total gun deaths per day is far fewer than the 500 Omar claims:\nTotal gun-related deaths, 2017: 39,773.\u00a0Average per day: 109.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage annual gun-related deaths, 2013-2017: 36,383.\u00a0Average per day: 100.\nTwo other anti-gun violence groups \u00a0\u2014 Everytown for Gun Safety, which McBath became a spokeswoman for after her son\u2019s death; and Giffords, which is named for former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords of Arizona \u2014 also use figures of 100 deaths per day or fewer.\nTo get near the figure that Omar used, you have to count nonfatal injuries as well as deaths.\nFor 2017, the daily average comes to 475 cases of gun-related deaths and injuries, based on CDC figures.\nBut the CDC itself says its injury estimate is \"unstable because of small sample size.\" And an analysis by The Trace and FiveThirtyEight indicates the CDC could be overcounting the number of firearm injuries.\nFinally, Amnesty International states that every day more than 500 people die from gun violence \u00a0\u2014 around the world. That\u2019s the figure Omar\u2019s office cited to back up her statement, and it arguably is low.\nA study published in 2018 in the Journal of the American Medical Association said there are about 250,000 gun deaths worldwide per year. That would amount to 685 per day.\nBut Omar\u2019s claim was clearly made in the context of legislation that would affect gun transactions only in the United States.\nOmar\u2019s spokesman, Jeremy Slevin, defended Omar\u2019s use of the 500 figure. But he acknowledged to us that Omar\u2019s tweet was in the context of domestic legislation and that the reference to 500 could have been more precise.\nOur ruling\nOmar said, \"Every day on average 500 people die from gun violence.\"\nHer claim was made in promoting legislation that would add new background check requirements for gun transfers made in the United States.\nBased on the latest federal figures, for 2017, the average per day was 109 \u00a0\u2014 that\u2019s counting deaths resulting from suicides, homicides, unintentional and undetermined deaths as well as those from law enforcement.\nAnd it\u2019s 100 if you use a five-year average for 2013 to 2017.\nWe rate Omar\u2019s statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00541"}
