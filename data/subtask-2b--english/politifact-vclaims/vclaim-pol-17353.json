We also found the video on Twitter and Facebook.\nThe \"undercover journalists\" in the video, Joe Basrawi and Josh Aminov, are college students and conservative activists for Turning Point USA, a group that supports limited government and free markets.\nThe YouTube video is similar to clips from Project Veritas, an investigative outlet run by conservative activist James O\u2019Keefe. Project Veritas has a history of using undercover reporting, hidden cameras and selectively edited videos.\nWith that in mind, we wanted to take a closer look at what was said during the video. We found that Gooding\u2019s comments were misconstrued to play into a common conspiracy theory about voter fraud.\nWhat Gooding said\nThe shaky video lasts nearly four minutes. It shows a booth at an outdoor event. No one\u2019s face is visible.\nOver the course of the recording, Basrawi and Aminov repeatedly question Gooding about how they can vote illegally. At four points, Gooding tells them that they must be citizens to vote.\nHere\u2019s everything that Gooding, co-founder of the liberal grassroots organization AZ Blue 2020, said in response:\n\nAminov: \"I like Democrat but I come here illegally. Can I register?\"\nGooding: \"No, you can\u2019t.\"\n\u2026\u00a0\nGooding: (to Basrawi) \"Are you registered to vote?\"\nBasrawi: \"No.\"\nGooding: \"How old are you?\"\nBasrawi: \"21.\"\nGooding: \"Are you a U.S. citizen?\"\nBasrawi: \"Not yet.\"\nGooding: \"OK. Are you going to get your naturalization?\"\nBasrawi: \"Maybe. I don\u2019t know.\"\nGooding: \"Well, when you do, if you do that, they actually have people there that will register you to vote, but you have to be a U.S. citizen and over 18.\"\nBasrawi: \"Oh.\"\u00a0\n\u2026\u00a0\nBasrawi: \"I\u2019m from the Middle East. I came here to study.\"\u00a0\nGooding: \"Where at? Where are you at school?\"\nBasrawi: \"Over at ASU. I want to vote to get Trump out of office.\"\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGooding: \"You have to get your citizenship to vote.\"\nBasrawi: \"I have to get my citizenship. There\u2019s no way for me to vote?\"\n\nThen the camera shuts off and is replaced by some distorted audio that claims to be the same interaction. In it, Gooding tells Basrawi and Aminov that, for them to vote, they\u2019d have to \"tell me you\u2019re a citizen when you\u2019re not.\"\n\nGooding: \"You can go to the Secretary of State\u2019s office, and ask them for a federal form because they don\u2019t verify your citizenship.\"\nBasrawi: \"And I can register to vote?\"\nGooding: \"Yes, but you\u2019re going to have to check the box that says you\u2019re a citizen. I mean you would, and it\u2019s illegal, but \u2026\"\u00a0\n\nWhen Basrawi and Aminov press him on the comment, asking if it\u2019s a \"big deal\" or if they would get deported, Gooding says: \"I have no idea.\"\n\nAminov: \"I want to support party.\"\nGooding: \"Yeah, I know. Really the best thing to do is to become a citizen.\"\u00a0\n\nWhen the two men continue to press Gooding on the voter registration form, he clarifies.\n\nAminov: \"Tuesday we can come, we register to vote and we don\u2019t need citizen.\"\nGooding: \"Well, there\u2019s a federal form, and they don\u2019t check your citizenship. So you illegally registered to vote.\"\n\nThen the video shuts off again.\nAZ Blue 2020\nThe video is misleading on several fronts.\nFirst, AZ Blue 2020, the group that Gooding belongs to, is not part of the Democratic National Committee. A public Facebook group for AZ Blue 2020 describes itself as \"an independent organization of energized volunteers who want to make a difference. Our goal is to elect Democrats at every level to create a Democratic governance in Arizona by 2020.\"\nRELATED FACT-CHECK: Did 3 million undocumented immigrants vote in the 2016 election?\nThe organization\u2019s mission is to \"empower and prepare the grassroots members of the Democratic Party, the Precinct committeepersons.\"\u00a0\nGooding told PolitiFact that AZ Blue 2020 does not have a connection to the DNC, which oversees the national efforts of the Democratic Party.\n\"We are a AZ State PAC and an Indivisible group,\" he said, referring to a progressive movement that launched after Trump\u2019s election.\nIn a phone call, Basrawi conceded that AZ Blue 2020 is not a DNC group but stood by the video\u2019s assertion that Gooding was teaching \"illegal voting.\"\nNon-citizen voting in Arizona\nDuring the YouTube video, Gooding repeatedly told Aminov and Basrawi that, if they want to vote in the federal election, they should become citizens. He said it\u2019s illegal to register as a citizen if you\u2019re not.\nWhat Gooding was describing in the video about a federal form is an Arizona quirk: the state accepts voter registration forms from people who don\u2019t provide proof of citizenship, such as a valid driver\u2019s license, birth certificate, passport or naturalization documents. But they can only vote in federal elections, they have to attest to their citizenship when they register, and they must bring a valid photo ID to their polling place.\n\"A person is not required to submit proof of citizenship with the voter registration form, but failure to do so means the person will only be eligible to vote in federal elections (known as being a \u2018federal only\u2019 voter),\" the Arizona secretary of state\u2019s website reads. \"A \u2018federal only\u2019 voter will become eligible to vote a \u2018full ballot\u2019 in all federal, state, county and local elections if he or she later provides valid proof of citizenship to the appropriate County Recorder\u2019s office.\"\nIf federal-only voters lie about their citizenship on Arizona\u2019s voter registration form, they are subject to prosecution, said C. Murphy Hebert, director of communications for the Arizona secretary of state.\nThe federal voter registration form also asks about applicants\u2019 citizenship status. Respondents must check either yes or no, under penalty of perjury.\nRELATED: Report about potential Iowa voter fraud is false\n\"We never use the federal form and have never registered a voter using the federal voter registration form, because we could be registering non-citizens,\" Gooding told PolitiFact in an email. \"My error was sharing that information with those with an ulterior motive.\"\nUndocumented immigrants sometimes end up registered to vote after getting a driver\u2019s license or state ID card. The Arizona Republic has reported on efforts by state elections departments to verify voters\u2019 citizenship.\u00a0\nOfficials in Maricopa County, where Phoenix is located, told the newspaper that \"instances of non-citizens or undocumented immigrants attempting to register, let alone casting ballots, are extremely rare.\" According to a database maintained by the conservative Heritage Foundation, there have been 20 confirmed instances of voter fraud in Arizona dating back to 2009.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nA YouTube video claims to show a \"DNC group\" teaching \"ILLEGAL VOTING in Arizona.\"\nThe group that the video purports to show is a grassroots local political organization in Arizona, and is not affiliated with the DNC. The activist in the video said multiple times that it\u2019s illegal to register as a U.S. citizen if you\u2019re not. He told the two men in the video that there is a loophole in Arizona and federal law by which prospective voters can register to vote without showing proof of citizenship. He did not encourage undocumented immigrants to try to illegally vote.\nThe YouTube video is inaccurate. We rate it False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17353"}
