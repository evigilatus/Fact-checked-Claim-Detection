The numbers speak for themselves.\"\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat potential false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe graph, which cites the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as its source, shows a declining abortion rate in the U.S. starting in the Reagan administration through the end of Obama administration. (It doesn\u2019t show data from the Trump years.) It shows the rate of abortions declining marginally under Republican presidents and more dramatically under Democrats.\nIn analyzing the post, we found two issues. First, states voluntarily report abortion data to the CDC, and which states report data varies wildly from year to year. For instance, California hasn\u2019t reported abortion data in more than two decades. Second, experts say the post oversimplifies the reasoning behind the decline and overstates the role the occupant of the White House plays.\nThe CDC data and historical rates of abortions in the U.S.\nSince 1969, the CDC has attempted to collected nationwide data to document the number of legal abortions, the abortion ratio (abortions versus live births), and the abortion rate (number of abortions per 1,000 women ages 15-44).\u00a0\nBut the CDC data isn\u2019t complete because not all abortions are counted.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe latest CDC abortion report, from 2016, used data from health agencies of 48 reporting areas (New York City and 47 states). But it did not include California, the District of Columbia, Maryland and New Hampshire \u2014 about 14% of the country\u2019s population.\nThat makes comparisons over time periods \u2014 or in this case presidential administrations \u2014 challenging.\u00a0\nOverall, the CDC says that the known number of abortions increased rapidly in 1973, after Roe vs. Wade, and reached their highest levels in the 1980s before decreasing \"at a slow yet steady pace.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nThe CDC says the decline temporarily slowed between 2006-08, before resuming.\u00a0\nThe specific declines cited in the graphic\u00a0\nAccording to the Facebook graphic, the abortion rate (per 1,000 women ages 15-44) declined 4% in the Reagan administration, and another 4% in George H. W. Bush\u2019s four-year presidency. Then, it plummeted by 30% during President Bill Clinton\u2019s two terms, and slowed once again during President George W. Bush\u2019s two terms, with only a 3% drop.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe last large decrease, the chart shows, came in the Obama years with a 26% decline. The most recent CDC abortion surveillance report is from 2016.\nThe percentage decreases generally line up with the available CDC data we reviewed. Though, that data isn\u2019t perfect.\u00a0\nFrom 1973 through 1997, the CDC compiled the data from 52 reporting areas in the United States: the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and New York City. But that changed in 1998 (states send in the data voluntarily). That year, the CDC received abortion data from 48 reporting areas, instead, excluding Alaska, California, New Hampshire and Oklahoma.\u00a0\nStates have continued to swap in and out over the ensueing years, but it\u2019s notable that California, the most populous state, has remained constant and hasn\u2019t submitted any abortion data since it stopped in 1998.\nWhat to make of the numbers\u00a0\n\"I think it is an oversimplification to say there is an association between the abortion rate and the political party occupying the White House,\" said Dr. Daniel Grossman, a professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at the University of California, San Francisco.\u00a0\n\"Many of the policies that might affect the abortion rate vary at the state level. These include things like whether there has been an expansion of programs, including Medicaid, to provide contraception for people living on low incomes, or alternatively, policies that might make it more difficult for clinicians to provide abortion care.\"\nNearly all abortion challenges have, indeed, come at the state level. The federal outliers are the 1976 Hyde Amendment, which prohibits which prohibits the federal government from covering the costs of abortions except in very rare cases, and the 2003 Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, which prohibits a form of late termination of pregnancy.\nBut by and large, federal lawmakers have had trouble passing abortion restriction laws.\nThe Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights, compiles abortion data every three years and surveys hospitals, abortion clinics and health departments.\u00a0\nIn 2017, the organization reported that the U.S. abortion rate had decreased to record low levels, dropping to 13.5 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15\u201344, the lowest rate recorded since abortion was legalized in 1973.\nThe decline may be due to fewer women becoming pregnant and increased access to contraception rather than by laws restricting abortions, said Elizabeth Nash, the institute\u2019s senior state policy manager.\n\"Between 2011 and 2017, the abortion decline appears to be driven by fewer people becoming pregnant in the first place, as both abortions and births declined. If abortion restrictions were the main driver across the board, we\u2019d expect the birth rate to increase,\" Nash said. \"There are a lot of potential factors at play, including increased access to affordable contraception (due to the Affordable Care Act among other policies that make it easier to afford contraception), new methods of contraception, and changing pregnancy desires and attitudes.\"\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post shares a graph on U.S. abortion rates and says the larger declines during recent Democratic presidential administrations is due to the party\u2019s approach of making abortions unnecessary, rather than the Repbulican party\u2019s approach of making them illegal.\nThe graphs cites CDC data, but health department reporting on abortions has fluctuated so much over the years that making broad comparisons can prove challenging. Not every state has reported its abortion data for every year.\nMoreover, experts said tying the abortion rate to the occupant of the White House alone is an oversimplification of a variety of factors that are at play.\nWe rate this claim Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19012"}
