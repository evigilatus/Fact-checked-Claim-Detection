Is that right?", "text": "On his first day in Iowa as a democratic presidential candidate, I heard Beta O'Rourke from a man in a coffee shop who said that teachers in his area needed more money. The guy said teachers are struggling and paying for school supplies. Aurourke, a former congressman in Texas, said that things aren't much better in Texas. \"Almost half of Texas's public school teachers work in a second or third job, not for kicks, not to spend extra cash, but only to cover expenses,\" said O'Rourke on March 14 in Kyok. \"To put food on the table, to buy that medicine with $444 a common payment, just to exist. At the same time, the gentlemen said in his question, from their own pocket, that they were buying supplies to separate them, Is O'Rourke right about how many public school teachers in Texas have other jobs? Aurourc &apos; s claim is based on a voluntary online survey close to the figures. But he exaggerates when he says it's certain why teachers take outside work. The Aurourke survey campaign of the Texas State Teachers &apos; Association stated that it relied on survey information from the Texas State Teachers &apos; Association. Texas is an organization affiliated to the National Association for Education, a labour union. The Texas Group recommended that the National Education Assembly endorse the 2018 Aurourke offer of the United States Senate. Aurourc lost the Republic X (Ted Cruz) election. In August 2018 (at the beginning of the new school year), Texas stated that according to a survey, about four out of 10 teachers expect to take additional jobs outside the classroom \"to cover family expenses.\" In August, Texas said: \"Almost 39 per cent of secondary school respondents need second jobs during the school year to supplement their school salaries.\" Fifty-six per cent of respondents said that they had summer jobs when the school was not in session. Clay Rubison, spokesman for the Texas State Teachers' Association, said to Bolivi Fakt: \"Teachers in Texas have been underpaid for a long time, and the financial plight of teachers has been exacerbated in recent years by high health insurance costs.\" The Texas Teachers &apos; Organization did not have an analysis of the number of teachers specifically receiving second or third jobs to compensate for financial needs. The average salary of public school teachers in Texas is lower than the national average. On average, Texas teachers receive $53,167 for the school year 2017-2018. At the national level, teachers have obtained an average of $60,483, verifying the facts mentioned by Tony Evers on January 12, 2021 in \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" \u2219 January 26, 2012, there is no data on why teachers specifically get additional jobs, but it appears that the main reason is to meet their needs, as Dr. Robert Manninger, an assistant teacher at the School of Education and Learning at Sam Houston State University. He is one of the researchers who conducted the Texas survey. Manninger said that most of the moonlight jobs revolve around the teaching profession, such as teaching. As Dick Starz, Professor of Economics at the University of California-Santa Barbara (not linked to the survey), told us, there is not much data available on why teachers generally get additional jobs, whether to cover living expenses or to cover additional family costs. He also doubted that the results of the Texas survey might not represent all State teachers because those who responded were more likely to be selective. The researchers sent a survey link to all members of the Texas Teachers &apos; Organization and the members responded voluntarily. There are about 50,000 teachers in the organization; 974 teachers responded to the survey. Does the survey reflect all teachers of public schools in Texas? Texas has about 350,000 teachers in public schools. \"The reflection of everyone will be impossible, I think,\" said Mananger. \"Can I circulate our results to the Texas teacher population? I think so.\" Sam Houston State University has been surveying teachers about their salaries since 1980. He said: \"For the past decade, the number of \"yes\" answers in the moonlight has been from 31 to 44 per cent.\" In his State of the State address in February, Texas Goff. Greg Abbott announced a reform of school funding and an increase in teachers &apos; wages as emergency items. The legislatures are considering legislation that would give classroom teachers and school librarians an annual salary increase of $5,000. More generally, at the national level, 18 per cent of regular full-time public school teachers reported having a job outside the school system to supplement their income, and the United States Department of Education reported in a June 2018 report based on the 2015-16 National Survey of Teachers and Managers. At the regional level, 17 per cent of teachers in the south worked outside their school system. The Southern District of Texas, the District of Columbia, and 15 other states. The Ministry of Education stated that its data were based on a nationwide survey of representative samples of public schools K-12, school principals and teachers in the 50 states and District of Colombia. \"Almost half of Texas public school teachers work in a second or third job, not for kicks, not to spend extra cash, but only to meet the burden,\" said the Governor, Aurourke. Aur\u00fcrk &apos; s claim is based on responses to a voluntary online survey sent to some 50,000 teachers in public schools in Texas. The respondents chose themselves. Approximately 1,000 answered. 39 per cent said they needed second jobs during the school year, and 56 per cent said that they received summer jobs when the school was not in session. On average, public school teachers are paid less in Texas than at the national level. However, researchers say that there is limited information on why teachers get additional jobs. The O'Rourke claim makes it seem as if paying for basic necessities is the only reason why teachers take additional jobs. This may be the case for some teachers, but we don't know if it's the driving factor for all of them. Aurourc's statement is partially accurate but does not contain significant details. We value it half right.
