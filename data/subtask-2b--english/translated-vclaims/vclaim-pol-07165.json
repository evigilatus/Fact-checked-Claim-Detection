The Republic of California, speaking to Greta Van Susteren on Fox News October 7, 2014, said he learned from the United States Border Patrol that Islamic State fighters had been arrested in an attempt to enter the country from Mexico. Hunter said: \"ISIL is coming across the southern border,\" and he said a moment later: \"I know that at least 10 ISIL fighters have been arrested across the Mexican border in Texas.\" As Hunter also said, \"the agents of the border patrol,\" but \"you know there are dozens of others that have not been captured by the border patrol.\" Our eyebrows have been raised. We've looked for details. None of the law enforcement agencies in the United States or the United States confirmed Hunter's version when asked about it, and Hunter Joe Kasper's spokesman refused to disclose Congressman's sources. In its original news report of October 8, 2014, Fox News quoted the Hunter Declaration from the Department of Homeland Security challenging his account. Internal security told Polyte Fact Texas that such fears had not occurred. Marsha Katron, speaking on behalf of the Agency, sent an e-mail: \"The proposal that individuals with links to ISIL have been arrested on the south-western border is entirely false, and is not supported by any credible intelligence or facts on the ground. The Ministry of National Security still lacks any credible intelligence to indicate that terrorist organizations are actively planning to cross the south-west border.\" After Hunter spoke, the Texas Ministry of Public Safety wrote to state legislators, saying on October 8, 2014, that they \"have no information to confirm\" the data on Islamic terrorists or ISIS fighters entering the country. Tom Finger, spokesman for the Democratic Party, confirmed the validity of the message. In the letter, Robert Bodish, Deputy Director of the Department of Public Security, mentioned an interview with Hunter and a press report issued on 8 October 2014 by the Judicial Supervision Authority, a conservative news site, which stated that Muslim terrorists had entered the country from Mexico. According to unknown sources of internal security, the Judicial Supervision Authority stated that four terrorists had been arrested by the federal authorities and the national security forces in the previous 36 hours in McClane and Farr. In the letter to legislators, Podish further wrote: \"Unsafe borders are certainly a weakness that criminals of all kinds can exploit, and it would be naive to exclude the possibility that no criminal organization may seek opportunities to take advantage of security gaps along our international borders. However, DBS has no information to confirm the specific statements recently published by the press.\" On 17 September 2014, the newspaper Politi Fact in Washington analysed the story of judicial oversight in August 2014, and often found false the claim of the other congressman that \"We know that ISIS is in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez,\" a neighbour of El Paso. The research did not reveal any law enforcement official or news director who independently investigated or supported the allegation, making the declaration \"We know\" certain that the Islamic State in Ju\u00e1rez was a significant extension. On January 22, 2021, Jeremy \"Spike\" Cohen mentioned an article on Facebook in which the Paiden administration said that she was a liberal terrorist. \u2022 On January 22, 2012, an expert in terrorism stated that Hunter's claim was unreasonable. \"It is unreasonable, given the way the criminal justice system operates, that 10 ISIL fighters have been arrested at the border and have not been charged,\" said Dave Gartenstein Ross, Director of the Centre for the Study of Terrorist Extremism at the Foundation for the Defence of Democracies in Washington. On the telephone, Gartenstein Ross said that he knew \"there are no reports coming through the Ministry of National Security indicating that a large number of ISIS fighters were intercepted at the border. I've spoken to a large number of people in the department, and the department has categorically denied it. \"There is no single evidence of that.\" Caspere, we were told we didn't confirm Hunter's statement. He said Hunter was sticking to what he said. Kasper also expressed doubt that the federal agencies were revealing the facts about the fighters being arrested. \"The problem here is that this is always a zero-sum game,\" wrote Kasper. \"We make the point. Official channels deny it. Then, perhaps in a few years from now, the information will appear on the front page of the Washington Post, \"like that newspaper this week mentioned new details about the scandal of the secret service of prostitution, as Kasper said. Our governor Hunter said, \"At least 10 ISIL fighters have been captured coming across the Mexican border in Texas,\" and there are \"tens more not arrested by the border patrol.\" There is no government agency that confirms anything close to the idea that at least 10 ISIL fighters have been arrested coming across the Mexican border. It should also be noted that the lead Texas agency in charge of public safety has warned legislators not to confirm it. Similarly, the notion of \"tens more not arrested by the Border Patrol\" lacks a realistic basis. Everything that has been said, this statement seems to us to be incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on fire! Pants on fire - The statement is inaccurate and makes a ridiculous allegation.
