Then we opened the email with that subject line and saw our alert reader meant vaccinations, not Fireball.\nThe question was about a meme that appeared on Facebook and other social media sites in the wake of the terrorist attack in Paris.\nThe wording, over the image of a syringe with a skull inside and the words National Mandatory Vaccinations stamped on top, was awkwardly clear:\n\"While Americans pray for Paris, France, their government sent HR (House Resolution) 2232 to Congress,\" it read.\nThe implication, of course, is that politicians took advantage of an international tragedy to quickly enact controversial legislation (all with a complicit press). Thank goodness for Internet memes, right?\nThe facts\nWrong.\nTo be clear, HR 2232 exists. U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson, D-Florida, introduced the Vaccinate All Children Act of 2015 on May 1.\nHer proposal would restrict the federal government from awarding preventive health service grants to state-level entities unless that state required all public schoolchildren be vaccinated. Exemptions are in place, only for medical reasons.\nWhile in theory that means it would remain a state decision to enact vaccination rules for public schools, the federal government\u2019s deep pockets have historically brought states in line.\nThe most famous example was the Reagan administration\u2019s decision in 1984 to use of the Highway Trust Fund to get states to raise the drinking age to 21. \nStates that didn\u2019t comply with the new national standard would see 10 percent of their federal highway funds cut. Eventually, every state agreed \u2013 and ensured that what amounted to several million dollars in some places would continue to flow.\nSo while the proposal does not officially make vaccinations mandatory, that would likely be the end result if it were passed into law.\nExcept for one major flaw with the meme. There was no movement on the bill since the massacre in Paris.\nIn fact, there hasn\u2019t been any action on the proposal since the GOP-controlled House assigned it to a subcommittee a week after Wilson introduced it.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin Nunes\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in an interview on Fox\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRepublicans have no way to communicate\u201d after tech companies cut off Parler.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Amy Sherman \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd there likely won\u2019t be.\n\"It\u2019s a Democratic bill, and it doesn\u2019t look like a coordinated move by the Democrats,\" said Kerwin Swint, chairman of the political science department at Kennesaw State University. \"This looks like a lone wolf type bill. It hasn\u2019t moved because it\u2019s not going to.\"\nThe conspiracy\nSo then why the meme?\nSeveral discredited claims about vaccines \u2013 most notably the thoroughly debunked link between the shots and autism \u2013 reared up again after a measles outbreak traced to Disneyland in California sickened 147 people in the United States. \nThe theme park outbreak \u2013 and the first reported American death from measles in 12 years \u2013 led to a new law in California that revoked \"personal belief\" exemptions and required all children in public schools without medical reasons to be immunized.\n\"While I absolutely understand the freedom to say no to healthcare, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a freedom to extend when it\u2019s to protect your child or to you put others at risk with your choice,\" said Arthur Caplan, the director of medical ethics at New York University\u2019s Langone Medical Center. \"It\u2019s not a bad idea to consider this on a national level.\"\nPushback and skepticism, though, has been fierce, from everyone from Hollywood celebrities who long objected to immunizations to the two physicians running for the Republican presidential nomination.\nThe anti-vaccination movement is one place where the left and right converge and from that, can move onto greater conspiracies, said Mark Fenster, University of Florida law professor who studies conspiracy theories.\nThe Paris attacks, then, are a \"false flag,\" an operation designed by conspiring forces \u2013 this time the media, government and pharmaceutical companies \u2013 to distract Americans from the goal of dangerous immunizations.\nA similar \"false flag\" theory is touted by some in connection with the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. There, the conspiracy goes, the government staged a horrible massacre in a bid to take citizens\u2019 guns.\n\"The anti-vaccine movement is obsessed with their fear of vaccines, and they view any government effort to require their use as a threat,\" Fenster said.\n\"Vaccines may have nothing to do with Paris, but the movement views it as a way to ram through this law while no one is watching,\" he added.\nOur ruling\nA meme making the rounds on social media takes a different tack on the Paris terrorist attacks.\nIt claims the tragedy has been a distraction to government efforts to mandate vaccinations for all public schoolchildren.\nThere is a proposal for a similar law, but there has been no movement on the proposal since a week after it was introduced last spring.\nThat\u2019s the last bit of truth to the meme. The rest of the message and implication border on the ludicrous.\nWe rate the claim Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05704"}
