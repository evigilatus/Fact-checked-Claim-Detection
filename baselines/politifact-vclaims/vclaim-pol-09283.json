Saxby Chambliss\u2019 seat up for grabs, Berlon would rather the party support a single candidate for an uncontested primary. That doesn\u2019t sit too well with some of the party\u2019s leaders, who chided Berlon for not putting up Democratic candidates to run in some key 2012 state races.\n\n\n\"When we ran the numbers, we saw fewer Democrats on the ballot in this last election than in more than 100 years,\" Long said. \"If your goal was to increase the turnout in all these counties, I\u2019m not sure how by having fewer Democrats run would meet that goal.\"\n\n\nOne hundred years is a long time and a lot of races to count. We decided to check out Long\u2019s claim and see whether old state ballots contained more Democratic candidates.\n\n\nLong left a public relations job to start Better Georgia, an affiliate of the ProgressNow network. Employees of the left-leaning group call themselves political troublemakers and highlight GOP policies with which they disagree. For full disclosure, Long is a former Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter who has also reported for CNN.\n\n\nWe first saw the exchange between Long and Berlon reported on the AJC\u2019s Political Insider blog. Long also provided us with his full quote from the event.\n\n\nHe also provided his research of the past seven statewide elections, from 2000 to 2012, with data compiled from the Georgia secretary of state\u2019s website. Long\u2019s chart showed the total number of Democrats on the general election ballot for the state House and Senate for those years.\n\n\nWe reviewed his provided numbers on the state website and found that within a few candidates in some years, Long\u2019s data were mostly accurate.\n\n\n\nYear\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 House\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Senate\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Total Democratic candidates\n\n2012\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 86\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 112\n\n2010\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 118\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 152\n\n2008\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 99\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 134\n\n2006\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 110\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 146\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2004\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 123\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 43\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 166\n\n2002\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 132\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 174\n\n2000\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 133\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 175\n\n\n\"Even with the state\u2019s increasing diversity, the number of Democratic candidates has decreased,\" Long told us. \"Demographics don\u2019t win elections. It\u2019s about putting candidates on the field to challenge for those seats.\"\n\nLong did not provide 100-year data to support his claim. He based his statement on the decreasing number of Democrats on the ballot (with a minor exception in 2010) since 2002, when Sonny Perdue was elected governor.\n\n\n\"Before that (2002) it\u2019s an assumption because the Democrats were in control of everything,\" Long said. \"The Democrats were the majority party.\"\n\n\nBut the pure numbers don\u2019t really mean anything in terms of candidates, Berlon told us. \"It\u2019s problematic to run a candidate in every race when you are the party not in power,\" he said. \"... We\u2019ve been targeting races we think we can win because we have a limited amount of resources.\"\n\n\nWe went further with our research, reviewing the numbers as far back as 1988, the earliest data available on the secretary of state\u2019s elections website. Those figures -- with the exception of 1994 and 1992, which were not available online -- showed that Democratic ballot representation didn\u2019t fall below the 171 candidates in 1998.\n\n\nBut Long\u2019s comment went back 100 years, and around here we aim to be totally accurate, so we also went back 100 years -- at least we tried to.\n\n\nWe pored over all the volumes of the Georgia Official and Statistical Register from 1923 to 1990 for more information. The register included ballot information for 1980-1990, 1970-1974 and 1966. State legislative data for all other years was not included, and elections officials were researching whether the information was available elsewhere.\n\n\nFor the years that were available, the Democratic candidates on the state ballots numbered in the 200s, up to 256 candidates in 1966.\n\n\nUntil 2002, Democrats held about 60 percent of the state\u2019s legislative seats, said University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock, who tracks state political trends. In the 1980s Democrats held about 80 percent of the General Assembly\u2019s seats.\n\n\nBut it\u2019s not uncommon for the minority party to have a harder time recruiting candidates, Bullock said.\n\n\nSo does Long\u2019s claim pass the test of time?\n\n\nHe said that Georgia\u2019s 2012 general election ballot included fewer Democratic candidates for the state House and Senate than in the past 100 years.\n\n\nState elections data that are available for the previous 46 years confirm Long\u2019s claim. Data before this point were not readily available to check. And there is a 42-year gap when information is not available.\n\n\nLong\u2019s overall point that 2012 was a light year for Democrats is correct. But he overreaches when he tries to stretch those numbers back a century. A lot of context -- and years -- are missing from his statement.\n\n\nWe rated his claim Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09283"}
