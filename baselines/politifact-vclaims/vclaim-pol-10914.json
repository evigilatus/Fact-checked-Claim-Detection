Meanwhile, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives is trying to nibble away at individual provisions.\n\nSeveral members of Congress, including U.S. Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., recently gathered for a photo opportunity and to speak for repealing a health-care law provision that applies to a 2.3 percent excise tax on the sale of medical devices and for a bill that would repeal it.\n\n\"In my congressional district, we have about 10,000 individuals that are employed in the medical device industry,\" Blackburn said. \"We have estimates from the Manhattan Institute that 1,000 of those jobs will be lost if this tax stays on the books.\"\n\nThat sounded pretty drastic to us. We decided to check out the accuracy of Blackburn\u2019s summary of the institute\u2019s findings, and what went into the institute\u2019s estimate.\n\nWe first went to Blackburn\u2019s press person, Mike Reynard, who sent us a YouTube video of Blackburn\u2019s statement; LifeScience Tennessee\u2019s Workforce Development Survey which includes as its third federal and regulatory priority \"Medical Device Tax Repeal\"; and, the Manhattan Institute\u2019s 30-page analysis of \"The Employment Effects of the New Excise Tax on the Medical Device Industry\" by Diana and Harold Furchtgott-Roth.\n\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Manhattan Institute is a conservative, market-oriented policy think tank based in New York City. It has received funding from the usually politically neutral Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Walton family foundation, but also from very conservative Koch and Scaife family foundations.\n\nLifeScience Tennessee is the non-profit advocacy group promoting the life science industry in the Volunteer State. Its survey uses slightly different numbers from Blackburn\u2019s in describing the Manhattan Institute\u2019s findings, saying it \"predicts a loss of 1,000 jobs in Tennessee, which currently employs more than 9,000 workers directly and many more indirectly.\"\n\nSince we know some of those 9,000 jobs are in Johnson City, Chattanooga and and Knoxville and other places outside Blackburn\u2019s 7th Congressional District, we can begin to quibble with Blackburn\u2019s suggestion that 10,000 are in her district, which stretches to connect suburban Nashville to suburban Memphis.\n\nFigures for 2011 from the Department of Labor and Workforce Development indicate there were 236 medical device manufacturing establishments with 8,871 employees in seven Tennessee counties -- or more than 10 percent fewer than Blackburn claimed were in her own congressional district.\n\nBlackburn represents people in parts of two of those counties -- Davidson and Shelby -- and those counties employ 6,044 people, a majority of the jobs in that category. We also know that in Shelby County, a large majority of those jobs have long been located in the mostly urban 9th Congressional District, not the suburban-rural 7th. Three Medtronic and three Smith & Nephew operations all have addresses within the 9th Congressional District.\n\nAlso worth noting -- because of re-districting, Blackburn will represent neither Shelby nor Davidson next year if she\u2019s re-elected.\n\nReynard, her spokesman, said Blackburn didn\u2019t mean to say \"in my congressional district,\" but rather that \"she meant \u2018state.\u2019 \" However, as of June 15, the video of the statement was still posted by the \"RepMarshaBlackburn\" channel on YouTube without any clarification, and other partisan websites were featuring it. PolitiFact policy is to rule on what is said, but to acknowledge when someone admits to a mistake and take that into account when making a ruling.\n\nBlackburn does make the point that anything affecting medical device manufacturing could have a significant effect on Tennessee employment -- many of her suburban residents do in fact work for firms like Smith & Nephew and Medtronic -- so let\u2019s look at exactly what the Manhattan folks said.\n\nThe study says Tennessee had 9,179 medical device manufacturing jobs statewide in 2009, nearly 10 percent fewer than Blackburn claimed. It then goes into a discussion from Macroeconomics 101 on the excise tax\u2019s anticipated effect on the elasticity of demand for medical devices. It assumes that price-sensitive elasticity would send some manufacturing offshore. It breaks down the number of jobs lost by the effect of the tax on a shift in production offshore of 1 percent, 2 percent, 5 percent, all the way up to 30 percent, where it says as many as 146,218 of the estimated 409,000 jobs nationwide might be lost.\n\nTable 11 on page 21 of the report indicates that in Tennessee 1,023 of 9,179 jobs would be lost statewide assuming a 2.3 percent excise tax and a 10 percent shift in production offshore.\n\nBut is that shift to overseas employment a reasonable assumption?\n\nWe hear a lot of talk these days about penalizing, not rewarding, companies that use the overseas labor of low-wage countries. To the extent it\u2019s not just talk, some politicians are seeing that some constituents thought they favored \"free trade\" until they saw that free-trade agreements may lower standards of living and manufacturing employment numbers of higher-wage countries.\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say this debate will rage on, but what\u2019s less clear is the extent to which health-care spending is sensitive to fluctuations in price. How will \u00a0those who need a catheter or a stent, or those who manufacture them, respond to the imposition of a 2.3 percent excise tax? If someone needs crutches, is a 2.3 percent rise in price a major consideration? A 2006 study cited by Businessweek in March indicates health-related spending is \"relatively inelastic: When prices go up, demand falls by only a fraction as much.\"\n\nThe same Businessweek article notes that another study, commissioned by the medical device industry trade association AdvaMed, also assumed that American manufacturers would ship 10 percent of jobs overseas in response to the tax. But since the tax applies to all devices -- those made overseas as well as domestic production -- there would be no incentive to move production out of the country, it says, describing a Bloomberg Government analysis. Devices manufactured in the U.S. for sale overseas are exempt from the tax.\n\nIt also makes the case that the industry trade group underestimated the increased demand for medical devices from the 32 million more people who will be insured under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nOur ruling\n\nBlackburn exaggerates the number of medical device manufacturing jobs in her district and in the state while citing a free-market advocate\u2019s 2009 study that says 1,000 jobs could be lost statewide.\n\nSome of the assumptions made by The Manhattan Institute study have been questioned, and the provisions of the bill itself mean there\u2019s little reason to suspect there would be much off-shoring based on the excise tax. There is also no consensus on how much demand might drop for medical devices produced in Tennessee based on pricing.\n\nTaking into account that Blackburn\u2019s office acknowledges she made a mistake in saying \"congressional district\" rather than \"state,\" we rate the statement Mostly False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10914"}
