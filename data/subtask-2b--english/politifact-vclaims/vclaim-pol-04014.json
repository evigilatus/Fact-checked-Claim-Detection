Mosby warns voters, \"Don\u2019t trust him.\"\nMosby told us back-up information for her claim about Morrissey\u2019s General Assembly record can be found on the state\u2019s Legislative Information System, which tracks measures that lawmakers write and pass every year. So we took a look.\nMorrissey served in the House from 2008 to 2015. We found a dozen bills that were signed into law for which Morrissey was listed either as the patron or chief co-patron.\nBut almost all fell outside of Mosby\u2019s specification regarding laws \"to help our black community with education or workforce.\" The lone exception we found was a 2009 law Morrissey wrote that required colleges, in the middle of a semester, to give full course credit to students who are deployed on active military duty.\nWe asked Morrissey for his take on Mosby\u2019s statement, and he sent us a letter pointing to 26 laws that he said \"had some connectivity to either education or workforce.\"\nOnly three of the laws Morrissey cited were measures where he was chief patron:\n\u2022 The 2009 military academic credit law mentioned above.\n\u2022 A 2008\u00a0law\u00a0to allow people who had their driver's license suspended for failure to pay fines to get a restricted driving permit if they showed there was a good reason they didn't pay their parking tickets. Morrissey's legislation was rolled into a similar bill sponsored by then-Del. Rosalyn Dance, D-Petersburg, that was signed into law.\n\u2022 A 2009\u00a0law that established guidelines for state investigations of licensed health professionals.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf the 26 laws Morrissey cited, the other 23 were measures he co-sponsored. Sometimes he was one of a few delegates backing a bill, but often he was among dozens of fellow lawmakers who supported a bill.\nSometimes the connection between the statutes to which Morrissey points and the categories Mosby cites is tenuous. But we did find some that could fall into the broad categories of education and workforce issues:\n\u2022 Morrissey was one\u00a0of 21 legislators who co-sponsored a 2010 law establishing virtual schools that allow public school students to take classes online.\n\u2022 In 2013,\u00a0Morrissey was one of 26 co-sponsors of a law that established guidelines for school districts to tackle bullying.\n\u2022 In 2008,\u00a0Morrissey was among 37 co-sponsors of a law authorizing $350 million in bonds for construction projects at colleges.\nIn 2009,\u00a0he was among nine sponsors of a law to establish guidelines for teaching financial literacy to K-12 students.\nOur ruling\nMosby said \"Joe (Morrissey) has been a delegate in the General Assembly for eight years with no laws passed to help our black community with education or workforce.\"\nA review of Morrissey\u2019s record shows he was not a prolific writer of laws that helped the black community in those two categories. But we don\u2019t come up empty.\nMorrissey introduced a bill - which became a law under another legislator\u2019s name - that allows people who can\u2019t afford to pay traffic fines to keep driving. That will help some people - black and white - get to work.\nMorrissey wrote a law that requires colleges to give credit to students who are deployed by the military during mid-semester. That will help some people - black and white - complete college.\nSo Mosby\u2019s statement has some basis but also overlooks some of Morrissey\u2019s broad legislative accomplishments.
