Anthony List, a political action committee that opposes abortion and supports anti-abortion candidates.\nThe Susan B. Anthony List\u2019s numbers derive from Planned Parenthood\u2019s 2013-14 annual report.\nThe first caveat to know\u00a0is that Planned Parenthood does not have a category for \"pregnancy services.\"\u00a0That\u2019s a category the Susan B. Anthony List created, and the background reasoning has been the same as similarly misleading\u00a0claims over the years.\nOn the fact sheet, \"pregnancy services\" are broken down into three categories: abortions, prenatal care and adoption referrals. Susan B. Anthony List spokeswoman Mallory Quigley said these are the three ways a woman can respond to a pregnancy.\nWith that in mind, here\u2019s the section from Planned Parenthood\u2019s annual report that contains those categories.\u00a0\n\nTo arrive at the Susan B. Anthony List figure, you have to tease out specific elements\u00a0from the chart:\u00a0prenatal services (18,684), adoption referrals (1,880) and abortions (327,653).\u00a0Abortions account for 94 percent of the sum of these subcategories.\u00a0\nFor several\u00a0reasons, that\u2019s a misleading way to analyze the data.\nReferrals for prenatal care not in equation\nNot all of Planned Parenthood approximately 700\u00a0clinics offer prenatal services because prenatal care is not Planned Parenthood's focus.\u00a0As a result,\u00a0many pregnant women are referred to outside obstetricians or other health providers for prenatal care.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow many? It's impossible to know.\nPlanned Parenthood does not record how many\u00a0pregnant patients are referred to outside health care providers,\u00a0said Elizabeth Clark, a Planned Parenthood spokeswoman.\u00a0\nIf referrals were included, the 95 percent figure would likely change, though we can't say by\u00a0how much \u2014 and neither can Smith nor the Susan B. Anthony List.\nThe rest of the story\nPlanned Parenthood\u00a0does not specifically\u00a0track of the number of pregnant women who come into clinics for\u00a0other reasons. And many of Planned Parenthood's services are not related to prenatal care, abortion or adoption.\u00a0\nTesting and treatment for sexually transmitted disease and\u00a0infection, both for men and women, accounts for the largest share of services provided by Planned Parenthood at\u00a0more than 4.47 million.\nContraception, which includes birth control, emergency contraception\u00a0kits, and\u00a0sterilization and vasectomy procedures, accounts for more than 3.58 million\u00a0services.\u00a0Different types of cancer screening and prevention, including breast exams,\u00a0account for 935,573 services.\u00a0\nAs show on the chart above, there were also\u00a0more than 1.1 million pregnancy tests, 47,2000 urinary tract infection treatments,\u00a0or 65,500 \"family practice services.\"\nOver the course of 2013-14, Planned Parenthood performed more than 10.5 million services. Sometimes patients are double-counted because they receive multiple services. Put another way. Planned Parenthood clinics saw 2.7 million individual patients that year.\nOf all services, abortions\u00a0account for 3 percent of services performed, said Erica Sackin, a Planned Parenthood spokeswoman, pointing to page 18 of the report.\u00a0\nBut looking at the share of abortions per patient (and\u00a0assuming one procedure per patient), the figure rises to\u00a012 percent.\nSome critics have taken issue with Planned Parenthood\u2019s measurement of \"services.\" Performing an abortion is more involved than administering pregnancy tests or giving someone a contraception kit, for example. The share of abortions might be different if cost or hours of services were used. (However, that information is not in the 2013-14 annual report.)\nOur ruling\nSmith said, \"Almost 95 percent of all (Planned Parenthood's) pregnancy services were abortions.\"\nAn anti-abortion group puts\u00a0the figure at 94 percent using a cherry-picked method that ignores the majority of Planned Parenthood's services, which aim to prevent pregnancies. The group describes\u00a0\"pregnancy services\" as counting what Planned Parenthood does for women once they are already pregnant.\nBut Planned Parenthood does not fully track this number, making the claim a leap of logic based on insufficient information.\u00a0What's most noticeably missing among the number of Planned Parenthood\u00a0services used by pregnant women are the number of pregnancy referrals.\nPlanned Parenthood says it doesn't keep records of how many pregnant women are referred to outside healthcare providers.\u00a0Without that information, we don't know an accurate\u00a0percentage of \"pregnancy services\" that were abortions.\u00a0Neither, however, does Smith.\nWe rate the claim False.\nUPDATE:\u00a0After this fact-check published, an official with Planned Parenthood contacted us and said that she was not authorized to speak on\u00a0the\u00a0record. A spokeswoman who is authorized to speak on\u00a0the\u00a0record, Elizabeth Clark, then provided us the same information. We've updated this fact-check to include her comments.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06114"}
