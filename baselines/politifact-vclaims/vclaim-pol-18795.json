(He does intend to stop new fracking on public lands.) But his vision for the oil industry hasn\u2019t gotten as much attention.\nTrump\u2019s characterization of Biden\u2019s position is vastly oversimplified, and he\u2019s suggesting Biden doubled down on a stance he never took in the first place.\nBiden wants to reduce the country\u2019s reliance on oil by investing heavily in renewable energy, and he plans to pay for part of that investment by ending federal subsidies for oil companies. He doesn\u2019t want to wipe out the oil industry as Trump claimed. In fact, some oil executives have cheered Biden\u2019s support for the development of technology that captures greenhouse gas emissions before they reach the atmosphere, allowing companies to safely burn fossil fuel for years to come.\nBiden\u2019s stance on oil was thrown into question after the presidential debate on Oct. 22, when he said he wants to gradually ease the country\u2019s reliance on fossil fuels.\nHere\u2019s an excerpt of the former vice president\u2019s exchange with Trump on the debate stage.\n\"Would you close down the oil industry?\" Trump asked\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL. Lin Wood\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in an interview with the Patriotically Correct Radio Show\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"China was behind the interference and the effort to overthrow our government and the election, election fraud.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Daniel Funke \u2022 January 19, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"By the way, I would transition from the oil industry, yes,\" Biden said.\n\"Oh, that\u2019s a big statement,\" Trump said.\nBiden stumbled over his words as he tried to explain his position \u2014 that he wants the country to transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy over time, and that he wants to end federal subsidies for oil companies. After the debate, he again stressed his interest in eliminating subsidies in interviews with reporters.\nBut the Trump campaign saw an opening and quickly declared that voters would abandon him in swing states where Biden has led for months.\nBiden\u2019s position on oil has been clear since he released his clean energy plan in July.\nThe document details Biden\u2019s stance on oil subsidies, his support for renewable energy, and his interest in developing technology to capture greenhouse gas emissions, as well as his plan to limit oil companies' methane pollution, ban new drilling on public lands and beneath public waters, and set new fuel economy standards that would reduce U.S. oil consumption by 12 billion barrels.\nOur ruling\nTrump said Biden wants to \"abolish the entire U.S. oil industry.\" He\u2019s oversimplifying Biden\u2019s nuanced position \u2014 and baselessly saying Biden confirmed that oversimplification. Biden wants to eliminate federal subsidies for oil companies and use that money to invest in renewable energy. Plus, Biden supports the development of carbon capture technology that could help oil companies stay in business. Trump\u2019s statement is inaccurate. We rate it False.\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click\u00a0here, for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18795"}
