The program is meant \"to offset the burden of Social Security taxes and to provide an incentive to work,\" according to the Internal Revenue Service.\n\n\nIn the federal version, when the tax credit exceeds the amount of taxes owed, it results in a tax refund to those who qualify. In the Illinois bill that Obama co-sponsored, state taxes can go to zero, but there is no additional refund.\n\n\nIn the 2000 legislation, the legislative record shows that Obama was one of more than 40 senators who co-sponsored the bill, with most of them signing up for it on the same day.\n\n\nBut the bill had a sunset clause, and when it came time to renew it in 2003, Obama filed the bill and was its chief sponsor. Another 20 senators signed on to co-sponsor it. Rather than renewing it for another few years, the Obama bill made the state earned income tax credit permanent, and it allowed for a refund if state funds were available.\n\n\nThe record shows Obama was a minor co-sponsor in cutting taxes in 2000 and was the leader in the state Senate in 2003 in making the tax credits permanent. It takes more than one person to pass a bill, and although he played a significant role in making the tax credits permanent, the record on Obama's statement supports only a Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16052"}
