(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In this case, the claim about Coulter is accurate.\nCoulter made the statement several times, notably on The View and on Twitter in 2015.\nThe particular quote in the meme comes from Coulter\u2019s 2015 appearance on The View where she discussed her book \"\u00a1Adios, America! The Left's plan to turn our country into a third world hellhole.\"\nAs The View panel and Coulter discussed Coulter\u2019s anti-immigration views, guest host Ana Navarro asks Coulter if she\u2019s Native American.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoulter responds, \"Why, yes I am.

While Coulter\u2019s mother\u2019s side can be traced back to colonialism, Smolenyak wrote that Coulter\u2019s paternal ancestors came to America two centuries later than the first Europeans \u2014 a stretch for fitting the definition of \"settler.\"\nWe're not judging whether it's accurate for Coulter to call herself a settler.
