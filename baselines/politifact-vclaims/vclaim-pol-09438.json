It also more than doubles a second charge to customers based on the amount of water they use and flush into the sewer system.\n\n\"Through this rate structure change, an estimated 50 percent of our residential households will see a decrease in their water and wastewater bills,\" Jones said in a March 12 news release announcing the plan.\n\nWe wondered if the mayor was correct.\n\nUnder his plan, the monthly base rate charged to all customers for water and wastewater service would drop from $49.40 to $26.11. Meanwhile, the second monthly payment based on the volume of water used would rise from $4.22 to $9.03 for every 100 cubic feet that comes into their taps or leaves their home as wastewater. That 100 cubic feet, listed as a \"ccf\" on a resident\u2019s water bill, amounts to about 750 gallons -- roughly 15 bathtubs full.\n\nThe new rates are part of Jones\u2019 proposal for a Richmond budget that is scheduled for a City Council vote May 13. Jones said his rates are not aimed at generating more revenues but were designed to shift more of the burden of supporting the utility to the residents who use the most water.\n\nTammy Hawley, a spokeswoman for the mayor, sent us a Department of Public Utilities chart breaking down the number of residential customers by their water use. The chart showed that 25,904 customers were billed for using 400 cubic feet or less each month in the 2012 fiscal year, the most recently completed budget cycle.\n\nThat comes to about half of the city\u2019s 51,832 residential customers.\n\nAnother chart Hawley sent shows that anyone charged for using 400 cubic feet or less would see lower bills. That\u2019s because the increase in their volume fee would be less than the savings they would get from the halving of the base rate.\n\nPeople right at that 400 cubic foot threshold now pay $66.28 a month. The new rates would drop their monthly bills to $62.23 -- a savings of $4.05. The less water they use, the greater their savings.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, customers who use 200 cubic feet \u00a0would save $13.67 each month. Their monthly bills, now $57.84, would drop to $44.17.\n\nCity charts show that the biggest savers would be the 13.7 percent of customers who use \"0 ccf\" a month. That doesn\u2019t mean these households don\u2019t use water, just that they consumed less than the 750 gallons threshold necessary to trigger a volume charge, said Angela Fountain, a spokeswoman with the Richmond Department of Public Utilities. So these users, who only pay the base rate, would save $23.29 a month.\n\nBut 750 gallons is precious little water to use in a month. Such a household would be limited daily to a 5-minute shower, one tooth brushing, one hand washing and several toilet flushes and monthly to two loads of laundry and several dish washings, according to estimates from the U.S. Geological Survey. We wondered if some of those households might be properties where no one is living but where someone still pays a water bill, such as a vacant apartment.\n\nFountain said no one knows.\n\n\"If we\u2019re sending them a bill, then we believe the property is occupied, that someone is using water there,\" she said. \"We can\u2019t tell you how many people, how often they\u2019re there. We just don\u2019t have that information.\"\n\nSo the mayor is correct that his plan cuts water and wastewater rates for half the city households. The unsaid part, of course, is that it raises rates for the other half -- those billed monthly for using 500 cubic feet or more.\n\nWe should note that the average residential household uses 600 cubic feet in water and wastewater each month, according to Raftelis Financial Consultants, a group that examined the Richmond\u2019s utility pricing in a March 2013 report. Such customers will see their bill rise from $74.72 to $80.29 -- a $5.57 increase.\n\nOur ruling\n\nThe mayor said that under his plan, half of the city\u2019s residences would see a drop in water bills.\n\nHis carefully worded statement is accurate. The unspoken part is that 50 percent will see their bills increase. The mayor also omits that his proposal would lead to a modest rate hike for the average water user.\n\nThe mayor is correct, but his statement benefits from additional information.\n\nWe rate the claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09438"}
