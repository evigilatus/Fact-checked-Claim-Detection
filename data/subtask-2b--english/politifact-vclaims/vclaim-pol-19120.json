You know why? They don\u2019t want you going to a certain BIG RALLY tomorrow! I bet the Big Tech hypocrites fix this \u2018bug\u2019 before Jan 20th.\"\nThe post features a video showing someone searching for directions to Washington D.C. in Apple Maps and receiving a message that says \"Directions Not Available.\"\u00a0\n\"Directions are not available at this time because of current road conditions,\" the app says in the video.\u00a0\u00a0\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe video appears to be authentic. Initially, PolitiFact staffers in Florida, Texas and Louisiana all tried to map directions to Washington using Apple Maps and received the same message.\u00a0\nHowever, another staffer based in New York successfully found a 3-hour and 51-minute route.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.

The app estimated it would take more than two days to reach D.C. from Texas that way.\u00a0\nAnd when staffers in Texas and Louisiana later tried to get directions by car, Apple maps provided them.\u00a0\nWe reached out to Apple for more information but did not immediately receive a reply.\u00a0\nMeanwhile, all four staffers were able to get directions to D.C. using Google.\u00a0\nWe don\u2019t know why the Apple Maps app is working for some people and not others. But it seems likely it\u2019s related to street closures.\nWe know that at least 42 streets in D.C. were scheduled to be closed to vehicular traffic from 6 a.m. to 11:59 p.m. on Jan. 5 and 6 in connection with planned demonstrations there.\u00a0\nWe found no evidence that \"Big Tech\" was trying to thwart protesters from reaching D.C.\u00a0\nWe rate this post Mostly False.\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click here, for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19120"}
