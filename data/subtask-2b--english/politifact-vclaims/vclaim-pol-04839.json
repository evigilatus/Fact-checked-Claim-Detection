The next month, he was on stage with Trump and eight other hopefuls for the first GOP debate, held in Cleveland. The candidates were asked to raise their hand if they would not pledge to back the party's nominee and swear off an independent run.\nTrump was the only one to raise his hand.\nIn other words, Walker pledged he would back the GOP nominee.\nOf course, at that stage, Walker himself hoped to be his party\u2019s choice, and it would be months before Trump became the presumptive nominee.\nWalker ended his presidential bid in September 2015, amid campaign cash-flow problems and a drop in the polls, \u00a0Ahead of Wisconsin\u2019s primary in April 2016, Trump was harshly critical of Walker, who endorsed U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. Soon questions turned to whether Walker would back Trump.\nApril 20, 2016: Walker told reporters: \"I will support the Republican running against Hillary Clinton in the fall -- whoever that is.\" Asked if he would do so even if Trump were the nominee, he said: \"Yeah. To me, I think it's preferable to have a Republican nominee over Hillary Clinton.\"\nMay 4, 2016: Alluding to the first GOP debate, Walker told reporters\u00a0the day after Cruz dropped out: \"I stood on the stage in Cleveland and said that I would support the nominee. I\u2019ve said it repeatedly since then and I\u2019ll be supporting the Republican nominee once that\u2019s officially set at the convention against Hillary Clinton.\"\nJune 6, 2016: The Post-Crescent in Appleton reported that Walker said he would have no problem supporting Trump even though \"he wasn't my first choice.\"\nHe said in the interview:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin LeMahieu\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a TV interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It takes quite a while on Election Day to load those ballots, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are issues, not the least of which lately with his statements about the judge he commented on, which I just fundamentally disagree with him on, so just saying that I'll support him over Hillary Clinton doesn't mean I embrace all the things that he says or all the ways that he says it.\"\nSo, Walker initially declared he would support the Republican nominee.\nThen, months later, as it became clear that Trump was closing in on the nomination, Walker repeatedly said he would support Trump -- though on at least one occasion he said his support once the GOP nomination becomes \"officially set.\"\nNow to the Walker comments that made national headlines.\nWalker\u2019s latest comments\nJune 7, 2016: The Wall Street Journal headline about Walker withholding a Trump endorsement was based on comments Walker made to reporters that were highlighted in a report by WKOW-TV in Madison.\nWalker denounced Trump\u2019s comments about the judge and said he wanted Trump himself to renounce them, according to a reporter\u2019s recording of Walker\u2019s remarks.\nA reporter then asked: \"Would that influence your decision at all on whether or not to back him as the nominee?\"\nWalker said: \"Again, we\u2019ll watch and see what happens. We\u2019ll be watching closely. There\u2019s still quite some time until he\u2019s even the nominee, so we\u2019ll have to wait and see.\"\nAsked what would cause him not to support Trump, Walker said:\n\"Well, again, he\u2019s not yet the nominee. Officially that won't happen until the middle of July, and so for me that's kind of the time frame on that. In particular, I want to make sure that he renounces what he says -- at least in regards to this judge.\"\nWalker added: \"I think for a lot of us, not just Republicans in general, we want to see what he\u2019s going to do between now and the time the convention comes. The sad fact is -- it\u2019s just sad in American that we have such poor choices right now.\"\nJune 8, 2016: After another question-and-answer session with reporters, the Associated Press reported, that Walker was wavering in his support of Trump and that he dodged a question on the issue.\nWalker was asked, according to a reporter's recording of that exchange: \"Do you still support him (Trump) as the nominee?\"\nWalker began his response by saying: \"Well, right now I'm focused on calling out, as I have the last couple days, the fact that I believe what he said about the judge is wrong -- not as a Republican, not as a political person, but I think it's just wrong as an American.\"\nWalker went on at some length criticizing Trump\u2019s remarks, ending by saying: \"He needs to make it abundantly clear to the American people that he does not embrace those ideas. And I think it\u2019s particularly important between now and the convention that he does that.\"\nOur rating\nDating back to August 2015, when he himself was a candidate for president, Walker said he would support the Republican presidential nominee. And several times over the next 10 months, Walker repeated that pledge -- including as it was becoming clear that Trump would be the presumptive nominee.\nBut on two consecutive days in June 2016, Walker shifted somewhat.\nQuestioned about Trump by reporters, Walker would not state his support as he had in the past. Instead, while criticizing Trump, he emphasized that Trump is not yet the nominee.\nOur definition of Half Flip is a partial change of position or inconsistent statements. That fits here.\nRecently on our Flip-O-Meter:\nNo Flip -- to GOP U.S. Rep.
