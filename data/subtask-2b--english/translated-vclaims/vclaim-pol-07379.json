Rick Scott is involved in a drilling project that was eventually closed down by the state. \"The Collier family, owners of the company that rented their land for oil exploration to drillers who threatened drinking water for seven million Florida,\" mentioned the novelist in the television commercial. \"Rick Scott took $200,000 from them, and now he's trying to hide from him.\" He looks familiar? At that point, the screen shows a picture of Scott while the text says, \"Takes the fifth 75 times.\" And then the ad reshoots Scott's video in the legal certificate of 1995, saying, \"I don't remember. I have no idea. What's your question?\" Polyte Fact Florida has previously checked the next-generation pledge of $200,000. We have verified the fact that the Florida Democratic Party's announcement about Scott took the fifth 75 times and assessed it mostly true. (Scott) Beg for the fifth was related to the issue of medical care, however, not oil exploration. But this new announcement revolved around another claim that we're going to check the facts here: is he trying to keep hiding from this donation? The Colliers' land and their donations to see if Scott's trying to \"conceal\" the donation require a little back story. In 2012, Collier Resources hired some 120,000 acres of mining rights in Collier County to Dan A. Hughes. Collier County is a county located in the U.S. state of Florida. However, despite protests by the population - including in front of Scott &apos; s house - the Ministry of Environmental Protection in September 2013 granted Hughes a permit to inject deep acid underground to break the limestone. However, Hughes wanted to try a procedure that had not been allowed in Florida in the past. In December 2013, Hughes followed up on this procedure and used it, although the Department of Public Education asked him to postpone it. This led the department to fine Hughes and then file a lawsuit, which Hughes is fighting. The Colliers aren't part of the lawsuit. Neither does Scott in his personal capacity. Why does all this matter to advertising? Because four members of the Collier family - Baron, Miles, Parker and Thomas - each gave $50,000 to Scott. Let's go to the working committee in January 2013. That is why S\u00e9gen had to claim in its earlier announcement that Scott was very comfortable with the interests of oil: \"a dangerous new type of oil exploration near Everglades threatened the drinking water of seven million Florida,\" which is part of the advertising states. \"But one Floridaer is the interest. Rick Scott drank from the campaign money fountain from the company that benefited from the pollution.\" Facebook published on January 27, 2021, in Facebook, says that Joe Biden canceled the Keystone pipeline because Warren Buffett \"doned $58 million\" for his campaign. By Tom Kircher: 29 January 2021, the screen text says: \"Rick Scott $200,000 in oil interest.\" The announcement did not mention Hughes, the oil drilling company or Colliers, the landowners who made donations, by name. Because the ad lacked those details, and because no contamination had been found so far, we evaluated it half right. The most recent announcement of the next generation takes this conflict another step, saying that Scott not only took the money but \"he's trying to hide from it.\" This is a reference to Scott's campaign's argument that she didn't take donations from Hughes. The Miami Herald reported that Scott's campaign spokesman, Matt Moon, strongly denied the suggestion that Scott would make that he took the campaign money from Hughes, the driller. In fact, there is no political entity associated with Jove. Scott has ever received contributions from the company -- in these elections or 2010, Mon said. The Republican Party in Florida adopted a similar strategy in a declaration, saying: \"The Jeff Team of Christ says. Scott took contributions from this polluter. It's a complete fantasy. Scott didn't take the nickel. Scott held the polluter responsible. \"Close the wells.\" In fact, both sides are vomiting some fog here. It's true that Scott didn't take the nickel from Hughes, but the announcement that he was going to produce didn't say he did. In the meantime, the Republicans are missing a major point -- that Scott took money from the Colliers, who are connected to the project referred to in the Declaration because they rented the land to dig. In the new declaration, an attack would have produced some caution in its formulation. He didn't say Scott was \"trying to hide it.\" This was to be more misleading -- these donations are a public record and Scott did nothing to restrict access to those records. On the contrary - many media reported these donations, starting in January 2013 when Colliers donated money for the first time. But instead, St. Jane said Scott was trying to hide donations. There is some truth: when Scott's camp attacked donations, he issued a statement that was essentially misdirected. Scott did not admit in his statement that the landowners gave the campaign money, although Hughes did not. Our ruling in the next generation's announcement is that Rick Scott took $200,000 from the Colliers who rented their land for oil exploration, and now he's trying to hide from it. In fact, both sides present self-interested images of the truth. Scott StenterGen invited him to say that he had received Hughes' money, but the group did not explicitly claim that he had received that money, and Scott's campaign statement ignored the fact that the campaign had already received money from Collier, a party that was an integral part of the drilling plan. For his part, the SnextGen charge that Scott is trying to \" hide from\" too much Collier's donations. The treatment was publicly reported in accordance with normal procedures, and there is no evidence that Scott tried to restrict access to that information. Quite the contrary - it has been widely discussed in media reports. The statement is partially accurate but omits important details. So we're assessing this claim half right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07379"}
