In this version, Michelle Obama and Oprah are absent though a similar call to action also asks people to repost the picture. But Know Your Meme has labeled this one a parody. Another so-called \"Fraternal Kiss\" parody photo in the site\u2019s collection? Obama kissing former Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. The image was part of a 2011 advertising campaign from the United Colors of Benetton (and the Obama White House was not happy about it).\nThe photo of Obama and Cameron, however, doesn\u2019t appear to be a marketing ploy. Rather, it looks like a guerilla Photoshop job.\nThe original photo shows Obama kissing Michelle. According to the caption on a Nov. 6, 2008, Belfast Telegraph story, it happened after he gave his victory speech in Chicago on election night on Nov. 4 that year. The image was also posted on other websites, like Pinterest. \u00a0\u00a0\nWe rate this Facebook post Pants on Fire!\n Share the Facts 2019-04-02 15:25:07 UTC   PolitiFact    1 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Pants on Fire  A photograph shows Barack Obama kissing David Cameron.
