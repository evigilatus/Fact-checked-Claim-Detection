(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nOn Oct. 24, Biden held a rally at a parking lot in Bucks County, Pa., north of Philadelphia, when Trump supporters could be heard \"making a ruckus from a short distance away,\" according to the Associated Press.\u00a0\nCNN reported that the Trump supporters were playing music, honking and shouting \"four more years\" as the former vice president spoke. In this video, tweeted by a CNN correspondent, Biden can be heard amid the din. He could also hear the noise, and addressed it.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAround the 22:15 mark of this video, honking can be heard in the background as Biden says: \"I am running as a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American president for everybody. I\u2019ll work as hard for those who don\u2019t support me as those who do, including those chumps at the microphone out there.\"\u00a0\nSo Biden did call some of Trump\u2019s supporters \"chumps\" during a rally in Pennsylvania.\u00a0 But the claim in the Facebook post that Biden calls Pennsylvania voters who don\u2019t support him \"chumps\" gives the impression that Biden was denouncing all such voters who don\u2019t cast a ballot for him. That\u2019s not the case.\u00a0\nHe was referring to a very specific group of people \u2014\u00a0those disrupting his speech \u2014 and not all of the president\u2019s supporters in the state. And his comments came as he was saying that he would be a president for all Americans, not just those who support him.\u00a0\nWe rate this Facebook post Mostly False.\u00a0\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click here, for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18832"}
