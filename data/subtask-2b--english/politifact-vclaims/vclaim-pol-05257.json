Then the Democratic leader said, to laughter, \"the folks who are currently governing the good state of Texas aren\u2019t interested in having more people participate.\"\nAbbott, a Republican, told reporters three days later: \"To the contrary of the president\u2019s comment, the\u2026 fact is, despite our voter registration laws, we had the highest level of turnout than ever before in the primary that occurred just a few weeks before he made that comment.\"\nWe\u2019re separately checking his turnout tout.\nAbbott, the former longtime state attorney general, went on: \"The fact is voter fraud is rampant--and in Texas, unlike some other states and unlike some other leaders, we are committed to cracking down on voter fraud.\"\nRampant fraud? We wondered, especially because we\u2019ve looked into identified instances, finding them rare.\nAbbott offers no backup\nAbbott didn\u2019t respond to our request for elaboration. So we don\u2019t know the basis of his \"rampant\" claim.\nBut generally, the prevalence of voter fraud has widely been doubted.\nIn 2013, for instance, a chart provided by then-AG Abbott showed 18 convictions, no-contest pleas or guilty pleas on voter fraud charges from 2002 through 2012. That\u2019s not a lot of fire but it was sufficient for us to find\u00a0False\u00a0a Democrat\u2019s claim that studies had shown voter fraud to be non-existent in Texas.\nNo surge, state records suggest\nAfter Abbott disagreed with Obama, we asked the Texas attorney general\u2019s office for its latest breakdowns.\u00a0Could there have been a fresh surge in fraud?\nNot according to the state documents, updated through February 2016.\nBut we did learn of the 2015 case of\u00a0Rosa Maria Ortega, charged with illegally voting in 2012 and 2014. A Tarrant County grand jury indicted Ortega for illegally voting in five Dallas County elections dating from 2005 through May 2014, according to a Nov. 9, 2015,\u00a0Dallas Morning News\u00a0account. The story said \u00a0she\u2019d allegedly registered to vote by swearing incorrectly that she was a citizen and it quoted Sharen Wilson, the Tarrant County criminal district attorney, saying: \"This is a big deal. People insist this kind of thing doesn\u2019t happen, but it\u2019s happening right here at home.\"\nAccording to the state's\u00a0updated information, about 20 voting-related referrals to local prosecutors have occurred since 2014 including a few \"illegal voting\" matters such as the Ortega case.\nA conservative compendium\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSherrod Brown\n\n\nstated on January 8, 2021 in an interview with Ohio reporters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummer \u201cprotesters outside the White House were met with tear gas, rubber bullets, a full militarized response. While ... rioters were able to breach the Capitol.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jon Greenberg \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNationally, the conservative Heritage Foundation in 2015 posted a\u00a0state-by-state breakdown\u00a0of voter and election fraud convictions. Its Texas section walks through convictions reached against a dozen Texas residents from 2006 through 2015 for schemes ranging from vote-buying to impersonation fraud at the polls to, in a 2012 instance, trying to register to vote despite lacking citizenship. In 2015, most recently, Francisco \"Frankie\" Garcia, Rebecca Gonzalez, Diana Balderas Castaneda, and Guadalupe Escamilla were convicted of trying to buy votes in a Donna school board race with cocaine, cash, beer and cigarettes, the foundation says, with all four pleading guilty. Also in 2015, Hazel Woodard of Fort Worth pleaded guilty to impersonation fraud; Woodard had been a candidate for Democratic precinct chair who had her teenage son vote for her husband at the polls out of concern the elder Woodard wouldn\u2019t make it to the polls, the foundation says. The gig was up, according to the foundation, after the dad showed up to vote after all.\nMore rare than a lightning strike?\nOther resources indicate there\u2019s not much there there.\nIn 2012, the News21 investigative project headquartered at Arizona State University\u2019s journalism school compiled a\u00a0database\u00a0that showed 104 Texas cases of alleged election fraud among 2,068 nationwide since 2000. The News21 students, who published their results Aug. 12, 2012, gathered allegations through public information requests, news accounts and court records.\nAccording\u00a0to the project\u2019s website, the students included all cases \"that had reached some level of official action: That is, someone was charged, an investigation was opened, a specific accusation was made against a named person.\" All told, News21 determined that 37 of the 104 Texas allegations were made against voters. Most of the cases were still pending at the time the students published their project in 2012, but 15 had resulted in a guilty plea or conviction, according to the database.\nA\u00a0follow-up PolitiFact fact check, posted in August 2015, found that in Texas since 2002, there had been 85 election fraud prosecutions, not all resulting in convictions. Some perspective: From 2000 to 2014, per the Texas Secretary of State\u2019s\u00a0online record, about 72 million ballots were cast in Texas (and that\u2019s not counting municipal and other local-only elections).\nIn 2015, Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, said most of the Texas prosecutions would not have been prevented by the voter ID law. \"There were a bunch of prosecutions for unlawfully turning in a ballot that people weren't supposed to have possession. There are a few instances of marking someone else's ballot without their consent \u2014 those are all absentee ballots. \u00a0There are a few of fake registration, or of voting while ineligible \u2014 none of which are stopped by a rule requiring ID at the polls,\" Levitt said. \"There are vanishingly few instances of voter fraud \u2014 incidents flat-out, not just prosecutions \u2014 that could be stopped by applying a rule requiring ID at the polls.\"\nAlso in 2015,\u00a0Lorraine Minnite, a Rutgers University political scientist professor who has testified as an expert on behalf of plaintiffs challenging the Texas voter ID law, pointed out 2012 court testimony by Major Forrest Mitchell, a criminal investigator with the Texas Attorney General\u2019s office, in which Mitchell admitted that only about five of the more than 300 election fraud referrals that had been investigated since 2002 dealt with in-person voter impersonation. Mitchell\u2019s testimony indicated that two of the cases could have been prevented by a voter ID law. Three people were prosecuted, though, since one case involved two people.\nAccording to an August 2014 analysis posted by the Washington Post, Levitt\u00a0found only\u00a0three credible allegations of fraud in Texas elections since 2000 which the state\u2019s Republican-brought voter ID law was crafted to prevent.\nSeparately, Minnite found four cases of this kind from 2000 until 2014.\nFour cases of fraud for 72 million votes cast suggests the incidence of Texas voter fraud was about 1 in 18 million.\nPlaintiff\u2019s lawyer: \u2018Not rampant\u2019\nWhile we didn\u2019t hear more from Abbott, we did reach\u00a0Jennifer Clark, a voting-rights lawyer for the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law, which\u00a0represents\u00a0the Texas State Conference of the NAACP and the state\u2019s Mexican American Legislative Caucus in an ongoing lawsuit challenging the Texas voter ID law.\nBy phone, Clark told us that \"under no definition of rampant is voter fraud rampant in Texas and the United States,\"\u00a0though, she said, \"that doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t happen.\"\nOur ruling\nAbbott, defending the Texas mandate to present a photo ID at the polls, said: \"Voter fraud is rampant.\"\nIf Abbott has the goods on this, he\u2019s keeping secrets.\u00a0Best we can tell, in-person voter fraud--the kind\u00a0targeted by the ID law--remains extremely rare, which makes\u00a0this claim incorrect and ridiculous.\nPants on Fire!\n\nPANTS ON FIRE\u00a0\u2013 The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.\nClick here for\u00a0more\u00a0on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05257"}
