According to incumbent Kate Brown and other prominent Democrats, a vote for Republican candidate Knute Buehler is a vote for right-wing Republicans and a vote to kill our vote-by-mail system.\n\nThis week, former Democratic Secretary of State Bill Bradbury, who was in office when Oregon became the first state to conduct a presidential election entirely by mail, chimed in with his thoughts on Buehler in a fundraising pitch:\n\nRepublican Secretary of State candidate Knute Buehler is right on message with the Republican talking points trying to scare voters (out of) vote-by-mail. If Buehler were elected, our vote-by-mail system would be at risk.\"\n\nSal Peralta, secretary of the Independent Party of Oregon, asked PolitiFact Oregon to check it out. Buehler also is the Independent Party\u2019s nominee for this office. (The other candidates in the race, by the way, are Pacific Green Seth Woolley, Libertarian Bruce Alexander Knight and Progressive Robert Wolfe.)\n\nVoters approved the citizen ballot measure switching to mail-in voting by a 2-to-1 ratio in 1998, so we know it was well received. Is it true that Buehler has a beef against the system?\n\nAs evidence of Buehler\u2019s alleged hostility toward vote-by-mail, Democrats have cited language from a column written by Oregonian columnist Steve Duinabout Republican attempts in other states to introduce new ID requirements for voters. Brown is quoted as opposed to the \"war on voting.\"\n\nThe part involving Buehler, we offer in its entirety, because readers need the context.\n\u00a0\n\nKnute Buehler, the Bend Republican opposing Brown in November, said he has no interest in ending vote-by-mail. The system is a popular element of the state's independent streak, he said, and he isn't hearing -- or pushing -- a move to return Oregonians to the polls.\n\n\nBut Buehler does say, \"There is some concern about the integrity of the process, where it takes more ID to rent a movie at Blockbuster than it does to vote. There are thousands of ballots floating around in various locations during the process. There are concerns about undue pressure to vote, because you don't have the privacy of a polling booth.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And I'm not sure we've done a thorough evaluation to see how we're dealing with these integrity issues.\"\n\n.\nSee that part where Duin writes that Buehler said he has no interest in ending vote-by-mail? Democrats probably saw that too, but for some reason, chose instead to focus on the language about Blockbuster and ballots floating around and the privacy of a polling booth.\n\nBuehler, in an interview with PolitiFact Oregon, said he still thinks it takes more ID to rent a movie than to register to vote in Oregon. He supports the idea of an audit of the system. And Buehler repeated to us -- as he clearly stated to Duin -- that he does not want to end Oregon\u2019s vote-by-mail system.\n\n\"I love vote-by-mail,\" he said. \"My point is that I just want to make it the best that it can be. Why are people so concerned about studying something?\"\n\nWe also talked to Bradbury.\n\n\"My understanding is that he has stated that the vote-by-mail system has had many problems with fraud,\" Bradbury said. \"If you\u2019re convinced that vote-by-mail is a fraud-filled system, it\u2019s very unlikely that you\u2019re going to support strengthening vote-by-mail.\"\n\nWe told Bradbury that Buehler didn\u2019t say that the system was filled with fraud -- just that there were questions that he wanted to address.\n\nBradbury\u2019s response? \"I don\u2019t feel very comfortable with someone being in charge of vote-by-mail if their biggest concern seems to be that there is a fraud-riddled system, or they\u2019re listening to friends who think it is.\"\n\nWe also offered Brown\u2019s campaign spokeswoman a chance to comment.\n\n\"Knute questions the very nature of vote-by-mail by saying that there is 'undue pressure to vote because you don't have the privacy of a polling booth.' Knute\u2019s statement fundamentally argues against vote-by-mail\u2019s existence,\" said Jillian Schoene in an email.\n\nBriefly, let\u2019s get back to the remark about Blockbuster. Buehler is interested in beefing up identification requirements to register to vote in Oregon, and that position definitely puts him to the right of Brown on the issue. But changing the requirements of registering to vote doesn\u2019t mean the way we vote in Oregon would be at risk by electing Buehler.\n\nDemocrats are hammering Buehler for raising questions. Raising questions about vote-by-mail -- even talking about the possibility that some people may feel pressured outside a polling booth -- is not the same as wanting to end vote-by-mail. Does Brown want to get rid of state agencies just because her Audits Division raises questions about them? We think not. That\u2019s her job.\n\nPolitiFact Oregon doesn\u2019t do predictions. Obviously, we don\u2019t know what Buehler would do if elected. More important, Democrats don\u2019t know either. When we look at the evidence they\u2019ve provided for his alleged antipathy toward the system, we just aren\u2019t convinced.\n\nIn fact, the evidence indicates that he likes vote by mail just fine. We don\u2019t know how many more times -- or in how many more ways -- he can say that he supports mail balloting. The statement is inflammatory and ridiculous.
