Rick Scott took the story of a group of Minnesotans crossing into Canada to drive home. \"Americans travel to Canada to pay 12 times less insulin than they did here in the United States,\" Scott tweet 8 July. Americans travel to Canada to pay 12 X less insulin than they would have paid here in the United States. This is unacceptable. It is time to treat American families fairly and pay a fair price for life-saving medicines. For this reason, I am fighting for a common logical solution: https://t.co/rmiuE8oLd https://t.co/E6IDSDK2 - Rick Scott (@SenRickScott) 8 July 2019 we have decided to explore whether Americans can get insulin in Canada in one of the 12ths what they will pay in the United States. The cost is certainly lower in Canada, but it is difficult to stabilize. In the United States in particular, the gap between the list and the actual price is often significant. However, persons without insurance are the most vulnerable to higher prices. Scott's tweet made the wrong comparison to an article in Miami Herald about a drug-buying trip organized by the sugar activist Quinn Nystrom. Nystrom announced that the exit was successful. \"Enjoy as we get out of the pharmacy in Canada after buying insulin for less than 12x from the United States. Insulin group application in the United States: $23,789.24. In Canada: $924.10, she said a nestrom tweet on July 1st. Pure joy when we get out of the pharmacy at o after buying insulin for less 12x and then at o. Insulin group order: $23,789.24 in: $924.10 we have a problem! One in four Americans ranks their insulin because they cannot afford it. #Caravanto Canada #insulin4all pic.twitter.com/NyRyQ4Vg7e - Quinn Nystrom (@QuinnNystrom) 1 July 2019 asked us where Nestrom came from. You told us it was the price the members of the trip would have paid if they didn't have insurance or discounts and paid the full price of the list. \"We did this because in Canada we were paying for the monetary retail there,\" said Nystrom. \"It was the closest comparison we could make. As soon as the insurance comes, it varies considerably in the United States.\" Some in the group had insurance. Others did not, and Nystrom faces huge bills. \"I have a high-cut plan, so in January, I paid from my pocket $600 for two bottles of Novolog - retail for $680,\" she said. On January 14, 2021, Chuck Grasley stated in a tweet that insulin prices had \"lost the RoOOF for patients/taxpayers bc from the manufacturer, a health plan and PBM Biz practices.\" By Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2012, the bottom line is that nearly $24,000 in Nestorum's tweet is the highest price possible because many would have paid less at their local pharmacy. \"The entire pharmaceutical industry has seen a large gap between the list and the actual reduced price over the years,\" said the pharmaceutical researcher Jeffrey Joyce at the Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics at the University of Southern California. \"Insulin is the poster child for this direction.\" Joyce called Naystrom \"fault\" 12 times. He said, \"That's true in extreme cases, but it's not a fair comparison between apples and apples.\" When the price is not the price, there are two main ways in which Americans avoid paying the full price for the medicines they prescribe. Persons with insurance benefit from negotiated prices that keep the medicine on the insurance list of covered medicines. Or if a person does not have insurance, he may have a coupon from a drug manufacturer that reduces the price. \"The price of medicines in general, specifically for insulin, is very complicated,\" said the 2018 study of the American Diabetes Association. \"With this system, there is no agreed price for any insulin formulation. The price ultimately paid by the person with diabetes at the point of sale is the result of prices, discounts and fees negotiated among stakeholders.\" That Byzantine system offers higher prices than in Canada, but research on what is the actual gap is minimal. One obstacle is that Canada has its own complexities. As mentioned earlier, the national health system does not cover prescription drugs. The experience of a person varies according to the province in which he or she lives and the employer &apos; s plans. At the same time, however, the prices of medicines in Canada are controlled by the Patented Medicines Review Authority. That government agency sets a price cap, partly based on the costs of the same medicine in other countries, which keeps cover for Canadians. (President Donald Trump put forward an idea along these lines.) Even with this approach, problems remain.) \"In Canada, you have the government to negotiate on behalf of Canadian citizens,\" said Joyce. \"In the United States, it's more market-driven, and if the market doesn't work very well, people pay more.\" Joyce asserted that in the United States, those with the least insurance and the least capacity to pay face the highest prices. As stated by our partners in the Kaiser Health News, one in four people with type 1 diabetes and type 2 are distributing their insulin. That means hundreds of thousands of people. Even if the price gap between the United States and Canada is on the smaller side, diabetes patients need insulin forever, and US prices increase. Our judge, Scott, said the Americans go to Canada to pay 12 times less for insulin than they would in the United States. And the difference for most people wouldn't be great, and in fact, it wasn't even great for people who read Scott about it. However, insulin prices in Canada tend to be several times lower than in the United States. Scott's number indicates the right direction, but it's exaggerating. We're assessing this claim half right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00441"}
