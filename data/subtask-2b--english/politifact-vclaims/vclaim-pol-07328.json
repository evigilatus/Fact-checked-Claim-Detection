Prepare for \u2018Honey, I'm checking how many calories we're burning on my #iWatch!\u2019 \"\nWe don\u2019t know if wearable tech will mesh with moments when little \u2014 if anything \u00a0\u2014 is worn, but the statistical reference to smartphones and sex raised the eyebrows of one of our fans, New York Times Upshot reporter Josh Barro, who tweeted asking for a fact check.\nWe asked Huffington for her source and she pointed us to a Huffington Post article from about a year ago. Indeed, Jumio, a firm involved with mobile credit and debit card payment systems, commissioned a distinctly non-random online survey of mobile consumer habits. Topping the press release was the finding that 9 percent of adults say they have used a smartphone during sex. For those 18 to 34, the percentage rises to 20 percent. (Huffington said use, while the study asked \"have used.\")\nWe asked Jenny Davis, the media contact for the survey, if there were any other details. In particular, we wanted to know what people were doing with their phones at times when their attention might be focused elsewhere.\n\"That\u2019s the question everybody has,\" Davis said. \"The survey didn\u2019t go further. I\u2019ve always thought a follow-up study would be interesting. Are they playing music? Are they taking pictures?\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOr looking up recipes, who knows?\nThe online report of the poll, we should note, included this word of caution. \"This online survey is not based on a probability sample and therefore no estimate of theoretical sampling error can be calculated.\"\nThat\u2019s an important distinction for anyone who knows anything about polling, and means that you shouldn\u2019t consider the results scientific or all together\u00a0meaningful.\nOur ruling\nHuffington said that 20 percent of young adults use mobile devices during sex. That, for the most part, accurately reflects the findings of an unscientific online poll.\nWhile the poll itself is dubious, there is no\u00a0better information available to contradict the poll of Huffington's claim.\u00a0Maybe the new Apple Watch will have an app for that one day.\nWe rate the claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07328"}
