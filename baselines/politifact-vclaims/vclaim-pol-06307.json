In his June 16 announcement speech, Trump said he also has a new competitor in the hotel biz: a group of entrepreneurial terrorists who call themselves the Islamic State.\n\"Islamic terrorism is eating up large portions of the Middle East,\" he said. \"They've become rich. I'm in competition with them. They just built a hotel in Syria. Can you believe this? They built a hotel.\"\nWe weren\u2019t sure if we could, in fact, believe Trump\u2019s claim that the Islamic State built a hotel in Syria, so we decided to check it out.\nThe grain of truth here is that the Islamic State has taken over a luxury hotel. But they didn\u2019t build it. And it\u2019s not in Syria. And it doesn\u2019t really operate like a normal hotel.\nWe couldn\u2019t find any evidence that the Islamic State is running any sort of hotel in Syria. We tried to get in touch with a Trump spokesperson and didn\u2019t hear back.\nHowever, this May, the Islamic State reopened a five-star hotel in Mosul that shut down when the terrorist group took over the city, one of the largest in Iraq. (Most of the information about this has come from Arabic language news sources.)\nSo the Islamic State didn\u2019t build the Ninawa International Hotel; they just occupied it.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, it\u2019s not really open for business. According to news reports, the Islamic State is using the hotel\u2019s 262 rooms to house the group\u2019s commanding officers, and they might use it as a wedding venue for the group\u2019s members.\nYou can\u2019t book a room at Ninawa online, and the TripAdvisor page is now defunct.\nBut pre-Islamic State reviews -- caught by Buzzfeed and others -- said the hotel had a good view of the Tigris river, a tennis court, gymnasium, swimming pool and two restaurants.\nNews reports say that, keeping with Islamic law, the Islamic State banned drinking and smoking in the hotel, and workers have removed decorations they disapprove of.\nOur ruling\nTrump claimed the Islamic State \"just built a hotel in Syria.\"\nThe Islamic State does occupy a luxury hotel, which they took over about a month and a half ago. However, it\u2019s in Iraq, not Syria, and they didn\u2019t build it. It\u2019s an old hotel that the group refurbished and occupied. As far as we know, the hotel\u2019s rooms are reserved for Islamic State commanders, and the event spaces are for weddings.\nAt least for now, Trump doesn\u2019t have to worry about the Islamic State running him out of the hotel business.
