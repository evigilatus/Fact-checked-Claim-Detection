Stasis was a big improvement compared to the heavy losses the industry suffered under President Barack Obama, when the workforce shrunk by 40 percent. Still, the revival Trump promised never materialized. There are 6,400 fewer miners today than when he took office.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nSo, what happened?\u00a0\nOne of Trump\u2019s first executive orders ended a ban on coal mining on federal lands and scrapped Obama\u2019s plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\u00a0\n\"Come on, fellas,\" Trump told the miners who had assembled for the signing ceremony in March 2017. \"Basically, you know what this is? You know what it says, right? You\u2019re going back to work.\"\u00a0\nThe Trump administration rolled back a slew of environmental rules that had harmed the industry and tried to stop coal-fired power plants from closing. It even spent $1 billion in taxpayer money on coal, including the development of smaller coal plants that could be fired up more quickly than larger facilities to better meet the fluctuating needs of the electrical grid.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.

And just over the border in West Virginia, Longview Power, the nation\u2019s most efficient coal-fired power plant, filed for bankruptcy that same month, citing the pandemic.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nTrump said he put coal miners back to work. He stabilized the industry after years of losses under Obama, but then the pandemic began, and the subsequent recession turbocharged the hobbled industry\u2019s decline. The 6,400 job losses the mining industry has suffered in recent months tracks with utility companies\u2019 waning demand for coal.
