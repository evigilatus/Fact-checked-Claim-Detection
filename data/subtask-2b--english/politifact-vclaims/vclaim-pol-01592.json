We set out on a fact check.\nOur research\nNewsom\u2019s campaign spokesman said the claim is supported by the July 2018 report\u00a0\"Child Poverty in California.\"\u00a0\nThat study produced an updated look at what researchers call the California Poverty Measure, which is a joint research effort by the Public Policy Institute of California and the Stanford Center on Poverty and Inequality to closely examine poverty in the state.\u00a0\nIt found that 45.8 percent of children in California were \"at or near poverty\" in 2016, the most recent year examined. That matches with Newsom\u2019s statement of \"close to half.\"\nBut we wanted to know how researchers came up with that number.\nCaroline Danielson, a PPIC policy director and co-author of the study, said the California Poverty Measure takes into account California\u2019s high cost-of-living, as well as factors that offset those costs, such as the state\u2019s social safety net programs.\nThe report found the share of children in poverty was 21 percent. It found an additional nearly 25 percent lived \"near poverty,\" meaning their family incomes was one-and-a-half times the poverty line, Danielson said.\nIn the report, the income threshold for poverty varies by region.\nIn a high-cost county, including many places along the coast, the average threshold for a family of four is $30,000 per year, Danielson explained. A family that makes less than that would be considered in poverty.\nIn that same county, near poverty includes families whose incomes range from $30,000 to $45,000, or one-and-a-half times the poverty line.\nOther counties had lower income thresholds.\nTo reach 45.8 percent figure, the study combined children who live at or near poverty in all regions of the state.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 28, 2021 in a blog\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook tried to \u201cshut down\u201d the campaign to recall California Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Chris Nichols \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDanielson said the state\u2019s child poverty rate has declined from 25 percent in 2011, the first year PPIC produced the California Poverty Measure, to 21 percent in 2016.\nCensus figures also support claim\nThe finding that nearly half of California\u2019s children live at or near poverty is also supported by data in the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s Supplemental Poverty Measure. An updated version of that report, which also takes into account cost-of-living, was released this month.\nFor 2016, it found 22.5 percent of California\u2019s children live in poverty while a total of 45 percent live at or near poverty, according to a review of that report\u2019s 2016 public-use dataset conducted by Danielson at our request.\nThe Census Bureau\u2019s Supplemental Poverty Measure has gained wide acceptance among researchers over the agency\u2019s Official Poverty Measure, which does not take state-by-state variations in cost into account.\nTwo researchers, however, raised questions in a recent op-ed in the San Francisco Chronicle about relying too much on that measure. David Brady, professor of public policy and director of the Blum Initiative on Global and Regional Poverty at UC Riverside and Zachary Parolin, a researcher at the University of Antwerp\u2019s Herman Deleeck Centre for Social Policy, asked \"whether California\u2019s poverty rate should depend so exclusively and overwhelmingly on housing costs.\"\nThey proposed using questions about median income, alongside the supplemental poverty measure, to arrive at poverty rates.\nThis isn\u2019t the first claim we\u2019ve fact-checked on California\u2019s dismal poverty rate. In January 2017, we rated True a claim by Republican Assemblyman Chad Mayes that California had the nation\u2019s highest overall poverty rate, when including children and adults and factoring in cost-of-living. Mayes, at the time, was citing the state\u2019s 20.6 percent overall poverty rate for the period 2013 to 2015.\nThat rate has dropped slightly but remains the highest in the nation at 19 percent, according to the Supplemental Poverty Measure for 2017.\nNewsom\u2019s plan for child poverty\nNewsom has described California\u2019s child poverty as \"a moral outrage.\" His campaign website includes several proposals for reducing it. They include, among other plans, creating college savings accounts for every incoming kindergartener; expanding the state\u2019s Earned Income Tax Credit for very low-income earners; and increasing CalWORKS grants, a financial assistance program for families in need.\nOur ruling\nDemocratic candidate for governor Gavin Newsom recently claimed \"close to half of the children\" in California are \"at or near poverty,\" when you consider the state\u2019s cost-of-living.\nA July 2018 report by the Public Policy Institute of California backs up Newsom\u2019s statement. It accounts for cost-of-living in each region of the state and found 45.8 percent of the state\u2019s children live at or near poverty.\nAnother report, the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s Supplemental Poverty Measure, also confirms the claim.\nNewsom\u2019s statement is supported by credible reports and includes necessary context.\nWe rate his claim True.\n\nTRUE\u00a0\u2013 The statement is accurate and there\u2019s nothing significant missing.\nClick here for\u00a0more\u00a0on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.\n Share the Facts 2018-09-20 00:29:34 UTC   PolitiFact    6 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: True  \"Close to half of the children\" in California are \"at or near poverty,\" when you consider cost-of-living.
