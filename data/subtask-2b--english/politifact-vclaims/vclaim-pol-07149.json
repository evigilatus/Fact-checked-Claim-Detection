Accordingly, billionaire and occasional presidential aspirant Donald Trump called out Obama for the cost of his recent New York fundraising trip.\n\"He raises a million dollars and it costs between $25 million and $50 million, and they close up the entire city of New York,\" Trump said Oct. 13 on Fox News\u2019 Fox and Friends.\nWe reached out to Trump to learn where he got his numbers and didn\u2019t hear back. But we wondered, would a one-day New York trip cost between \"$25 million and $50 million\"?\nThe president made a one-day trip between Washington\u00a0and New York on Oct. 7. According to the White House schedule, from take-off at Andrews Air Force Base to return took a bit over nine hours. In New York and Connecticut, Obama attended two events for the Democratic National Committee and one for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.\nObama traveled to John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York via Air Force One, which is the call sign for one of two 747 jets specially equipped with communications gear so the president is always able to respond in an emergency. According to a 2012 report from the Congressional Research Service, the policy arm of Congress, the hourly cost of Air Force One is $179,750. On domestic trips, a cargo aircraft and a backup aircraft normally accompany Air Force One.\nFor the purposes of Trump\u2019s calculation, that would put the total cost of the air travel between $360,000 and $1.6 million, assuming a range of two and nine hours of usage time for Air Force One.\nNote: Under the rules of presidential travel, when the purpose of a trip is political, not official, the president\u2019s political organization reimburses the government. For airfare, the price is based on the cost of a commercial ticket for the president and all those who accompany him. In this case, the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee would be on the hook.\nIn addition to the aircraft, there would have been a Secret Service cost, but those figures are classified. There also would be security costs for the New York Police Department.\nTo get a fuller picture of what the cost of presidential travel is, we have to go back to 1999 for a more comprehensive accounting. That year, the Government Accountability Office, Congress\u2019s auditing division, looked at the price tag for three foreign trips taken by President Bill Clinton. Again, these numbers don\u2019t include the Secret Service\u00a0expenses, or the pre-trip planning. But they do include pretty much everything else. (We adjusted the 1998 dollars to account for inflation.)\n\n\n\n\n\nTrip\n\n\nTotal days\n\n\nDaily cost (2014 dollars)\n\n\n\n\nAfrica - six nations\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\n$5.1 million/day\n\n\n\n\nChile\n\n\n5\n\n\n$3 million/day\n\n\n\n\nChina\n\n\n9\n\n\n$3 million/day\n\n\n\n\n\nForeign travel requires much more staff and equipment than the one-day jaunt Obama made to New York City. In Africa, for example, the Marines sent a helicopter squadron. The Air Force deployed five additional planes and ran refueling missions. The Chilean trip pulled in about 600 staffers from a variety of agencies. There were hotels and meals to pay for.\nWhile we can\u2019t know all the details of Obama\u2019s New York jaunt, there is no evidence that it approached the complexity of either of the lower cost trips in the GAO report.\nAnd if those trips halfway around the world came in at about $3 million per day (in today\u2019s dollars), it is extremely likely that a back-and-forth to New York would cost less. Much less.\nBottom line: Presidential travel is expensive, but Trump\u2019s estimate of Obama\u2019s fundraising trip to New York is wildly high, based on everything we know.\nOur ruling\nTrump said Obama\u2019s recent New York fundraising trip cost between $25 million and $50 million. Trump provided no evidence, likely because all the available information points to a total that would be way, way lower than $25 million, let alone $50 million.\nWe rate the claim Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07149"}
