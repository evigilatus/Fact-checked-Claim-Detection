We reached out to the Democratic National Committee for comment but did not get a response.\nThe story includes a few sentences contradicting its overarching claim.\nIt said that Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., was asked on MSNBC if ICE should exist, and that her answer \u2014 \"certainly\" \u2014\u00a0 \"sparked a backlash among some liberals.\" (In the interview, Harris said undocumented immigrants should be deported if they commit serious and violent offenses. \"ICE has a purpose. ICE has a role. ICE should exist.\")\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolitical pundits have speculated that Harris might run for president in 2020. But her stance of keeping ICE goes against yournewswire.com\u2019s claim that Democrats announced they will abolish ICE if they win the 2020 election.\nThe story does include legitimate examples of others calling for an end to ICE, including statements from Brian Fallon, former Hillary Clinton campaign spokesman, and posts published by some media organizations.\nFallon on Jan. 21, 2018 tweeted\u00a0that Democratic candidates in 2020 \"should campaign on ending the agency in its current form.\"\nJack Mirkinson, a news editor for the website Splinter, took it further in a story responding to Harris\u2019 MSNBC interview,\u00a0writing, \"ICE must be abolished. Anything less is not good enough.\"\nThe Nation published a piece on March 9 from researcher and writer Sean McElwee headlined, \"It\u2019s Time to Abolish ICE.\" Yournewswire.com notes that The Nation\u2019s piece quotes Angel Padilla, policy director of the Indivisible Project, which describes itself as working to \"to defeat the Trump agenda, elect progressive leaders, and realize bold progressive policies.\"\nYournewswire.com included a tweet by MSNBC host Chris Hayes\u00a0that linked to McElwee\u2019s article and wrote, \"This is a growing position on the left, and I imagine 2020 Democratic presidential aspirants will have to grapple with it.\"\nThe Nation\u2019s story mentions several Democrats running for Congress and for state offices who support defunding ICE. But it does not cite Democrats with plans to run for president in 2020 calling for ICE\u2019s abolition.\nWhile there are calls from some Democrats running for state offices and Congress to defund ICE, yournewswire.com\u2019s post offers no evidence of presidential hopefuls making such claims. It actually cites one possible presidential contender, Harris from California, as saying ICE should exist.\nWe rate yournewswire.com\u2019s post False.\n Share the Facts 2018-03-15 20:30:40 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  \"Democrats announce they will abolish ICE if they win 2020 election.\"     yournewswire.com Bloggers https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:jtnoWA1FrssJ:yournewswire.com/democrats-abolish-ice-2020/+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us   in a blog post Sunday, March 11, 2018 2018-03-11    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02304"}
