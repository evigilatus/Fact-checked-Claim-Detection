He also likes to belittle those of his political rivals.\nOn Feb. 11, Trump went to the border city of El Paso, Texas, to tout his get-tough policies on immigration. On the same night, Beto O\u2019Rourke, a possible 2020 Democratic presidential candidate who previously represented El Paso in the U.S. House, spoke to a crowd elsewhere in El Paso.\nDuring his speech, Trump mocked the turnout of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s event.\nTrump described O\u2019Rourke as \"a young man who's got very little going for himself, except he's got a great first name.\" Trump added, \"He challenged us. So we had, let's say 35,000 people tonight and he has 200 people, 300 people. Not too good.\"\nWas it true that just \"200 people, 300 people\" attended O\u2019Rourke\u2019s speech?\nWe may never know the exact number of attendees -- we sought an official estimate from the El Paso Police Department and the city government of El Paso, but none was provided by publication time. Media reports suggested the number was in the thousands. For instance, the Texas Tribune reporters in El Paso wrote that \"about 7,000 people went to see O'Rourke speak at the park, according to an aide, who cited law enforcement.\" (The White House did not respond to a request for information.)\nStill, after reviewing photographic and video footage of the event, we conclude that the number was definitely higher than the 200 to 300 Trump said.\nConsider video footage distributed by O\u2019Rourke on Twitter. Here\u2019s a freeze-frame showing the middle of the crowd from the perspective of the podium:\n\nPanning to the left, we see that the crowd continues (we\u2019ve cropped it to avoid duplication):\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd if you pan further left, there\u2019s still more (also cropped to avoid duplication):\n\nMeanwhile, a livestream video published by the El Paso Times has a different, and more narrow, perspective -- facing the stage. But even this view suggests a crowd of more than just 200 or 300 people.\n\nAs for the question of whether 35,000 people attended Trump\u2019s rally, news reports suggest that law enforcement officials disagree with his estimate.\nAn El Paso Fire Department spokesman told the El Paso Times that the venue where Trump was speaking holds 6,500 people for that type of event, and it was filled to capacity. A few thousand more might have been standing outside, fire public information officer Enrique D. Aguilar told the newspaper, though there was no official count\u00a0made of the outside crowd.\nThis would mean that the total crowd size \"might be 10,000 with the people outside,\" Aguilar told the paper. Other reported estimates were a few thousand higher. Either way, those estimates were well below Trump\u2019s total. (We will update this article if an official government estimate is released.)\nOur ruling\nTrump said that at O\u2019Rourke\u2019s rally in El Paso, there were \"200 people, 300 people.\"\nOur review of the available visual evidence suggests that the number is clearly several times that. Media reports suggest the number may have been much larger still, in the thousands.\nWe rate the statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01029"}
