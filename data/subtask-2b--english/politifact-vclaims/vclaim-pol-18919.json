(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nIn the name of supporting the police, this post feeds a narrative of racial and political division, and nothing about it is accurate \u2014 including the photo.\u00a0\nOn Sept. 12, a gunman walked up to a parked police car, opened fire and ran. Two sheriff deputies, a man and a woman, were badly injured. Anti-police protesters gathered outside the St. Francis Medical Center in Lynwood, Calif., where the two officers were being treated.\nSome protesters yelled, \"We hope they die.\"\nWith those basic details as context, everything else about the post is false.\nHere is the post\u2019s full text:\n\"Last night in California, a 6-year-old boy begged God to save his mother\u2019s life after she was ambushed and shot, unprovoked, while sitting in her police car. Today, the NFL will honor and praise the organization that stood out outside his mother\u2019s hospital chanting, \u2018we hope she dies.\u2019 Make no mistake, Anyone who watches football today, purchases NFL merchandise or supports these teams in any way has blood on their hands.

Some players took a knee as the national anthem played. Some wore shoes or shirts that said, \"End racism,\" or \"No justice, no peace.\" Both slogans are common within the Black Lives Matter movement, but in no way did any player or the NFL honor the protesters outside the Los Angeles hospital.\nThe sheriff\u2019s department said it has tied no organization to the protesters who gathered outside the hospital.\nWe rate this post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18919"}
