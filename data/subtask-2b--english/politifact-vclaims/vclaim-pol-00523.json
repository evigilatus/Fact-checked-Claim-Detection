A list of words and abbreviations, such as \"xoxo,\" \"congratulations,\" and \"BFF,\"\u00a0that when included in a status update or comment trigger animations such as color changes, balloons or hearts.\nWe reached out to Facebook for a response to the claim but did not hear back before publication.\nThe rumor appeared to pop up in the spring of 2018 \u2013 right around the time Zuckerberg appeared in Congressional hearings to answer questions on Facebook\u2019s data privacy practices after more than 50 million users\u2019 private information was shared without their permission.\nAnd although this BFF claim has been labeled a hoax by several outlets, it re-surfaces on the social media website every so often.\nWe rate it Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00523"}
