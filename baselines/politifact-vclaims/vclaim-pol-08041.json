Charlie Crist is a very rare breed of a candidate running in a competitive statewide race: He\u2019s in love with Obamacare, and he\u2019s not afraid to say it.\nIn fact, it\u2019s terrible that Gov. Rick Scott is against the law, Crist says, in a new online video responding to Scott.\n\"The truth is Rick Scott wants to take us back to the days of insurance companies denying coverage for pre-existing conditions, where women are charged more than men, and lifetime caps limit care, even for kids with cancer.\"\nSeveral opponents of the law say they want to scrap it but keep elements they support -- for example, banning insurers from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions, one of the most popular elements of the law. We wanted to check what Scott has said in the past about pre-existing conditions.\nWe asked Crist\u2019s campaign for documentation that Scott is in favor of denying coverage for pre-existing conditions. Former Sen. Steve Geller, an informal adviser to Crist\u2019s campaign, cited newspaper reports that stated Scott had failed to propose an alternative to the health care law.\nWe asked Scott\u2019s campaign for his position on pre-existing conditions. Spokesman Greg Blair pointed to a July 2012 interview Scott gave to Newsmax, a conservative news outlet:\n\"If you\u2019re worried about pre-existing conditions, give the individual the same tax breaks as an employer so when you change jobs, you don\u2019t lose your health insurance, just like you don\u2019t lose your life insurance if you have your own policy,\" Scott said.\nScott made similar remarks in July 2012: \"Give individuals the same tax breaks as employers so they can buy their own insurance so they won't have to deal with the pre-existing conditions.\"\nWe weren\u2019t sure how tax breaks would end exclusions for pre-existing conditions, and Blair declined to elaborate on Scott\u2019s proposal.\nHealth care experts \nWe sent Scott\u2019s quote about tax breaks to health care experts and asked if that would be a solution to pre-existing conditions. They told us that if the 2010 health law disappeared, a 1996 law protects most people from denial after gaps of less than 63 days. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act established that time frame.\nThat means if you lose coverage but get new coverage within the 63-day window, you don\u2019t have to worry about pre-existing conditions. And insurers can only look back 18 months for coverage gaps.\nBut if you go without insurance for longer than 63 days, then the experts told us that Scott\u2019s tax breaks don\u2019t help you.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMark Pauly, a professor of public policy at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, said a tax break has no direct connection to covering pre-existing conditions.\n\"Giving Gov. Scott the benefit of the doubt for lack of artfulness, I think he was referring to proposals that would give \u2018portability\u2019 to people who had obtained group coverage so they could continue that coverage (and its tax break) even if they went to self employment or a job in a company not offering coverage. ... The general idea (is) that you can continue your coverage without being singled out for \u2018re-underwriting\u2019 if you had continuous coverage.\"\nInsured people in poor health are more likely to lose their coverage from one year to the next if it is employment-based coverage rather than individual coverage, he said.\nPolicy experts disagree on just how helpful Scott\u2019s proposal would be.\nMichael Tanner, a health care expert at the libertarian CATO Institute, said Scott\u2019s suggestion \"is part of a long-term solution that I think would do a very good job of dealing with the problem. In the end some people would probably still fall through cracks, but for most people with pre-existing conditions, this solves the problem.\"\nOn the other hand, Jonathan Oberlander, a health policy professor at the University of North Carolina said that by themselves, tax credits do little to help people with pre-existing conditions.\n\"A limited tax credit will not help someone with cancer get coverage unless there are protections in place that compel insurance companies to take all customers regardless of their medical condition and that prevent insurers from charging exorbitant premiums to persons with pre-existing conditions,\" he said.\nCrist\u2019s campaign told us that Scott is suggesting changes to federal tax law that governors don\u2019t have a say in anyway.\nDespite Scott\u2019s opposition to the health care law, it is still being implemented in Florida. As of February 440,000 Floridians signed up for plans, the most of any state using the federal exchange.\nOur ruling\nCrist said in a video, \"Rick Scott wants to take us back to the days of insurance companies denying coverage for pre-existing conditions.\"\nThere is no dispute that Scott has been a persistent critic of the health care law which banned insurance companies from refusing coverage due to pre-existing conditions.\nWe could not find many comments from Scott about pre-existing conditions, and the two brief remarks we found didn\u2019t explain his ideas in detail. Overall, Scott supports tax breaks that allow people to buy their own insurance, and if they keep themselves insured, they don\u2019t have to worry about pre-existing conditions.\nBut that would leave those who end up uninsured for more than a few months in danger of being denied coverage for pre-existing conditions.\nWe rate this claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08041"}
