Superimposed over a photograph of Sanders, it said, \"Instead of removing the conditions that make people depressed, modern society gives them antidepressant drugs. In effect, antidepressants are a means of modifying an individual's internal state in such a way as to enable him to tolerate social conditions that he would otherwise find intolerable.\"\nWe asked the reader who sent us the image for the original source, and he sent us to a personal page on Facebook. That page alone reported more than 9,000 shares and 1,000 likes for the Sanders image.\nBut did Sanders really say (or write) this? We took a closer look.\nA quick Google search provided an answer. Those words were actually written by Theodore Kaczynski. Kaczynski was arrested in 1996 and accused of sending mail bombs to universities and airlines that resulted in three deaths and 23 injuries over two decades; he pled guilty and is now serving four life sentences.\nKaczynski was captured after he sent a 35,000-word \"manifesto\" to the Washington Post and the New York Times in 1995, saying he would commit another bombing unless it was published in full. On the recommendation of the attorney general and the FBI director, the Post published it as a supplement to the newspaper. Its publication is credited with breaking the case, after Kaczynski\u2019s brother David recognized the writing style and arguments in the manifesto as his estranged brother\u2019s and informed the authorities.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s a portion of the manifesto, archived on the Post\u2019s site:\n\"Instead of removing the conditions that make people depressed, modern society gives them antidepressant drugs.
