We've ruled this separately. However, other remarks made by Trump about the so-called \"birth\" dispute inspired their own fact-finding processes. Trump has already said about Obama's birthplace: \"Hilary Clinton and her 2008 campaign started arguing about Obama's birth. I finished it. I finished it. You know what I mean.\" We assessed the first part of that claim that \"Hilary Clinton and her campaign in 2008 started arguing about the generator\" was wrong. And here, we're going to check the fact that Trump is \"finishing it.\" We did not hear a reply from the Trump campaign, but the night before the Trump announcement in Washington, Jason Miller, the campaign's chief communications adviser, sent a partial press release saying: \"In 2011, Mr. Trump finally managed to bring this terrible incident to an end by successfully forcing President Obama to issue his birth certificate. Mr. Trump did a great service to the President and to the country by ending the issue raised for the first time by Hillary Clinton and her team.\" It seems, therefore, that the campaign's argument is that Trump prompted Obama to issue the long form of his birth certificate in Hawaii on 27 April 2011, after several years of controversy over the generator. Previously, there was a shorter version of the document, but skeptics called for the full document to be issued. Trump himself had presented this case early on August 22, 2013, when he tweeted, \"Why do people piss me off on Obama's president's birth certificate? I made him fire it, or whatever, when no one else could!\" But in order to withstand Trump's argument in the water, we see two conditions that must be met. First, did Trump call for the generator's point of view as soon as Obama issued his long birth certificate? And secondly, was Obama's long testimony \"ending\" an idea among American voters that Obama was born outside the United States? In either case, the answer is no. The ongoing Trump tweeting of Slate's birth produced a comprehensive catalogue of Tramp's tweets - all of which were released after Obama's document was issued in 2011 - in which the major estates either openly called for birthright or encouraged questioning of the official story of Obama's birth. The list contains some 13 examples between November 2011 and November 2014. Here's a sample: July 17, 2012: \"I wonder what's the answer to Barack Obama's request for the question: place of birth? Maybe the same cover as his book? Write down your records, mister. Hey, boss! The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" By Samantha Buterman: January 11, 2021 20 July 2012: \"With @BarakObama, he listed himself as \"Bourne in Kenya\" in 1999 http://bit.ly/JaHQW0 were the laws that allowed him to submit a false certificate. #SCAM\" August 6, 2012: \"A very reliable source\" called my office and told me that @BarakObama birth certificate is a fraud.\" August 27, 2012: \"Why do the Republicans keep apologizing for the so-called \"birth\" issue? No more apologizing... take the attack!\" September 13, 2012: Wake up America! See article: \"Israeli Science: Obama's Fake Birth Certificate,\" http://bit.ly/UpfG7B. June 29, 2014: \"Remember always, I'm the one who got Obama to release his birth certificate, or whatever that is! Hilary can't, McCain can't.\" September 6, 2014: \"Beware all pirates: you're hacking into everything else, so please hack Obama University records (destruct?) They checked the \"place of birth\" of public opinion about Obama's birthplace. The argument over the birth did not actually end, either, based on polls. At first, the issuance of the birth certificate itself did not remove suspicion within the public about Obama's birthplace -- not even close. At least two surveys considered this issue shortly before and shortly after the issuance of the Obama document. Gallup asked whether respondents would say that Obama was \"probably or certainly born in another country\" and found that the number had decreased from 24 per cent before his release in April 2011 to 13 per cent after his release in May 2011. And Yogoff asked you if Buck Obama was born in the United States. Before release, 15 per cent of respondents said \"false,\" which fell to 13 per cent after release. Thirteen percent is not a insignificant number of people in a nation of more than 300 million people. Over time, the polls conducted by Yuzhov have in fact found increasing numbers of respondents who answered \"fake\" \"Brack Obama was born in the United States\" - 17 per cent in January 2012 and 20 per cent in July 2012. More recently, in September 2015, CNN/Opinion Research Corp. found opinion polls 13 percent the answer to \"Another country\" when asked, \"Where is Barack Obama's boy, as far as you know?\" This survey took place more than four years after Obama issued his long birth certificate. Our governor Trump said about the born argument, \"I've finished it.\" This is not true in any reliable sense. Trump wasn't \"finishing\" the generator's conspiracy fire once Obama issued his long birth certificate in April 2011 -- he kept tweeting about it for at least three and a half years. There is a core group of Americans that has not \"finished\" the expression of the feelings of the generator. More recently, a year ago, various polls found that 13 per cent of Americans supported the point of view. We appreciate Trump's claim for pants on fire. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f8a8c00a-de79-480b-8444-2e5f66aab040", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04309"}
