Nathan Deal, House Speaker David Ralston and Senate Majority Leader Chip Rogers by name. If they back the reforms, ATR said, they\u2019re breaking a promise they made when they signed the group\u2019s anti-tax pledge.\n\nThe proposal \"is akin to shards of glass in a delicious creme brulee,\" Grover Norquist, leader of the Washington-based group, said in a written statement Jan. 10. \"It is a bit of desirable tax reform ruined by an overall tax hike.\"\n\nAre there really shards of tax-hike glass in an otherwise yummy overhaul?\n\nIn June, then-Gov. Sonny Perdue created the Special Council on Tax Reform and Fairness for Georgians to recommend a rewrite of the state\u2019s tax code.\n\nCritics think change is overdue. They argue that the code is outdated and riddled with exemptions for special interests. They also want the state\u2019s income to rely on revenue sources that aren\u2019t so vulnerable to economic downturns.\n\nOn Jan. 7, the council came back with more than a dozen recommendations. They included lowering the 6 percent personal and corporate income tax over three years to a rate that \"does not exceed\" 4 percent, re-establishing a tax on groceries and eliminating many exemptions.\n\nCouncil members recommended lowering income tax rates to levels they think will zero out any potential revenue increases, said Christine Ries, an economics professor at Georgia Tech and a member of the council.\n\nState legislators now must decide how to incorporate the recommendations into a bill.\n\nThree days later, ATR called the recommendations an \"overall tax hike.\"\n\nATR used data from the council\u2019s report and its own estimates to determine cuts would total $3.375 billion over three years but hikes would total far more -- between $4.77 billion and $5.75 billion. Since the proposal would increase state revenue, it counts as a tax increase, its officials told PolitiFact Georgia.\n\nATR\u2019s focus is on the recommendation\u2019s overall effect on revenue and not whether certain individuals would pay more taxes. We will therefore focus on revenue, as well. \u00a0\n\nWe took our own look at the council\u2019s report and found that while it\u2019s possible the changes would increase tax revenue, it might not.\n\nUnder the council\u2019s proposal, a grocery tax would start right away, but reductions in personal and corporate taxes that would offset that hike would phase in over three years. Therefore, in the first year taxes could rise. Our rough calculations put that jump between some $250 million and $1.4 billion.\n\nThe report, however, lacks revenue estimates for major pieces. It has none for two years of the three-year cut in personal and corporate income taxes. Estimates for other initiatives, such as eliminating the tax on energy used in manufacturing, are missing as well. News accounts place the cost of this tax anywhere from $80 million a year to $420 million.\n\nMore complete estimates are in the works.\n\nWhen you tally what numbers are available, it\u2019s not clear whether tax numbers would rise or fall. PolitiFact Georgia was able to cobble together reasonable scenarios in which they increased and dropped.\n\nFor instance, if you follow ATR\u2019s assumptions and take the high revenue estimates for taxing groceries, increasing cigarettes taxes and taxing person-to-person auto sales, revenue would jump by an average of more than $1 billion a year (about 6 percent of the state budget).\n\nIf you use low revenue estimates and ignore ATR\u2019s assumptions, they would sink by nearly $119 million (roughly 1 percent). \u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnother problem is that ATR boost its revenue estimate by about $1.23 billion over three years by assuming state-level reform would enable Georgia to collect sales taxes from out-of-state Internet retailers.\n\nBut state changes can\u2019t create this windfall. This is largely a federal issue, and the constitutionality of collecting this money is in dispute. Other states, the U.S. Congress and courts will likely have to act before this money comes in. It\u2019s not clear when or if this will happen.\n\nATR opposes taxing e-commerce, but \"that said, we are merely using the numbers we were provided,\" Joshua Culling, the group\u2019s state affairs manager, said in an e-mail. \u00a0\n\n\"Most of what has been discussed about this plan has been guesswork to this point,\" Cullig added. \"ATR\u2019s scoring of the plan is as comprehensive as anything out there.\" \u00a0\n\nWe talked to other experts and found they were hesitant to label the proposal a \"tax increase.\"\n\nKelly McCutchen, who is president of the Georgia Public Policy Foundation, a Libertarian-influenced think tank, cautioned that even valid revenue estimates can vary widely.\n\nFor instance, the foundation\u2019s estimate for the revenue from taxing food was more than $175 million higher than one by the Georgia State University Fiscal Research Center. \u00a0\n\nWhether the proposal would constitute a tax increase is up for grabs, McCutchen said.\n\nKail Padgitt, a staff economist for the fiscally conservative Tax Foundation in Washington, noted that taxes may jump initially because of the timing of income tax cuts. Still, the group currently favors the proposal because its language would allow legislators to solve this problem by slashing income taxes more quickly and deeply than recommended. \u00a0\n\nAnother issue is ATR\u2019s \"tax hike\" definition. Tax revenue is currently unusually low because of the foundering economy. It\u2019s fair to ask whether \"revenue-neutral\" means the proposal maintains current revenue levels or returns us to pre-recession figures, said Sarah Beth Gehl, deputy director of the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute.\n\nTo sum up:\n\nATR concluded the reform recommendations were an \"overall tax hike\" before it had enough evidence. PolitiFact Georgia\u2019s own analysis found that the tax overhaul could increase or cut taxes. \u00a0\n\nATR also included a $1.23 billion boost in e-commerce revenue that recommendations cannot bring about on their own.\n\nCalling the recommendation an \"overall tax hike\" is therefore akin to telling Georgians there are shards of glass in their creme brulee before it reaches the table.\n\nATR\u2019s assessment contains some element of truth, but it is premature and ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. It therefore meets our definition of Barely True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the 2017 tax law, \u201cpeople who make under $75,000 will have their taxes raised in 2021 and every 2 years after that until 2027.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEditor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.
