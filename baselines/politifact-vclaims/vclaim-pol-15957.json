And it has got to be brought under control.\"\n\n\nThe bear study in Montana has become a go-to line in McCain\u2019s stump speeches, and we fact-checked an almost identical line when McCain said it before an audience of evangelicals\u00a0at Saddleback Church in Orange County, Calif., on Aug. 16, 2008.\n\n\nThe U.S. Geological Survey is indeed conducting a study that involves the DNA of bears in Montana, but the\n\nNorthern Divide Grizzly Bear Project\n\nactually has received more earmarked funding than McCain mentions \u2014 to the tune of $4.8-million, according to Katherine C. Kendall, the researcher in charge of the study.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe study had received $3.1-million in earmarked money by 2003, the year McCain first started taking aim at the project (he mentioned it on the Senate floor as part of a speech criticizing earmarks). But apparently McCain's campaign rhetoric hasn't been updated to reflect the additional $1.69-million the study's gotten since 2003.\n\n\nAnd, strictly speaking, the point of the project isn't really to analyze the bears' DNA, it's to use their DNA to take a census. The researchers collect hair left when the grizzlies scratch themselves on trees, then use DNA extracted from the hair to identify individual bears. This helps researchers count the number of grizzlies that live in Montana, considered one of the last strongholds of this endangered species.\n\n\nKendall said it's a much cheaper \u2014 and safer \u2014 way to count them than traditional methods, which involve capturing grizzly bears and saddling them with satellite collars. It also has resulted in doubling the previous population estimates. The new figures, when paired with the results of another study on population trends, may eventually lead to removing grizzlies from the endangered list.\n\n\nMcCain's math is a little dated. And he clearly is suggesting \"the study of bear DNA\" is a frivolous use of federal money, but we won't argue the merits of the project. McCain claims $3-million in federal money has been used to study the DNA of bears, and that's Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-15957"}
