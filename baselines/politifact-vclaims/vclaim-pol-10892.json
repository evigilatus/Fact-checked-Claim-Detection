Chris Christie makes it sound, Democrats in the state Assembly are a bunch of crazed junkies looking for their next fix of raising taxes and he\u2019s the one forcing them into withdrawal.\n\nAt a June 13 town hall meeting in Atlantic County, the Republican governor pointed to his opposition to a proposed gas tax increase as an example of him fighting off the Democrats\u2019 addiction.\n\n\"Now I\u2019ve been governor now for over 800 days and we vetoed two income tax increases. They wanted to raise the gas tax by $2.4 billion. We said no to that,\" said Christie, according to a video posted June 14 on YouTube. \"Imagine now if you\u2019re paying 20 to 25 cents more a gallon. That\u2019s what the Assembly Democrats would have gotten for you. We\u2019re saying no to all that stuff.\n\n\"So now\u2026you got to see what\u2019s happening with the Assembly Democrats. They\u2019re like people going through withdrawals. They haven\u2019t gotten to raise a tax in over 800 days. They\u2019re down on the ground. They\u2019re sweating. They\u2019re twitching. It\u2019s ugly, \u2018cause I keep saying no.\"\n\nSuch colorful language, and yet so misleading, PolitiFact New Jersey found.\n\nThere has been a proposal to raise the motor fuels tax by about $2.4 billion, but despite Christie\u2019s suggestion, it hasn\u2019t been pushed by the Assembly Democratic leadership and stopped by the governor. In fact, the legislation has never made it to the governor\u2019s desk for him to take any action.\n\nState Assemblyman Albert Coutinho (D-Essex) has introduced the bill twice over the last roughly two years, but has never received additional legislative sponsors or a committee hearing. The full Assembly has never voted on the proposal.\n\nAs Coutinho put it, \"this bill is going nowhere.\"\n\nFirst introduced in May 2010, Coutinho\u2019s bill called for annual increases of 8-cents-per-gallon in fiscal years 2011 through 2013. According to the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services, those increases were projected to generate a total of about $2.4 billion over the three-year period to go toward the state\u2019s Transportation Trust Fund.\n\nCoutinho said the tax hike would allow the state to stop borrowing for the fund, which supports various transportation projects.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the 2017 tax law, \u201cpeople who make under $75,000 will have their taxes raised in 2021 and every 2 years after that until 2027.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the bill, which Coutinho reintroduced in January for the current legislative session, hasn\u2019t moved an inch since being referred to an Assembly committee.\n\n\"Leadership\u2019s not looking to do this,\" Coutinho told us. \"Nobody seems willing to politically have that conversation.\"\n\nTom Hester Jr., a spokesman for the Assembly Democrats, explained that Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver does not support raising the gas tax.\n\n\"Hundreds if not thousands of bills are proposed each session without getting a hearing. Nothing unusual about it at all,\" Hester said in an e-mail. \"The governor is once again misleading the public.\"\n\nChristie spokesman Michael Drewniak noted how other Democrats have indicated support for a gas tax increase, including state Sen. Raymond Lesniak and state Assemblyman and state Democratic Party chairman John Wisniewski.\n\nAs for Christie\u2019s role in stopping such a tax hike, Drewniak added: \"The Governor was emphatic many times amid this discussion by Democrats that he would not sign legislation increasing the gasoline tax and add a new tax burden on over-taxed New Jersey residents.\n\n\"The unambiguous promise of a veto is often just as effective in stopping legislation in its tracks as is the actual act of a veto.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nAt a town hall meeting, Christie claimed Assembly Democrats \"wanted to raise the gas tax by $2.4 billion. We said no to that.\" Now Democrats are \"down on the ground. They\u2019re sweating. They\u2019re twitching. It\u2019s ugly, \u2018cause I keep saying no,\" Christie added.\n\nThe governor\u2019s right about there being a Democratic proposal to raise the motor fuels tax by about $2.4 billion, but Assembly Democratic leaders have stopped the bill from moving forward. Since its first introduction in May 2010, the bill has never received additional legislative sponsors or a committee hearing.\n\nSince Christie\u2019s claim \"ignores critical facts that would give a different impression,\" we rate the statement Mostly False.\n\nTo comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10892"}
