He criticized Mendoza for touting her opposition to a vehicle sticker price increase in 2011 during her time as Chicago\u2019s city clerk as part of her campaign launch.\n\"Susana Mendoza\u2019s assertion that she fought Rahm Emanuel\u2019s efforts to drastically raise city sticker prices is absurd,\" Vallas said in a statement sent out by his campaign. \"As news stories earlier this year by WBEZ and ProPublica painfully show, Mendoza pushed a draconian city sticker penalty program that led to the financial ruin of thousands of Chicago\u2019s neediest families.\"\nHis press release linked to a July story from ProPublica Illinois and WBEZ in which Mendoza expressed regret for backing an increase in the cost of city sticker violations, a policy that ProPublica and WBEZ revealed had exacted a painful financial toll on thousands of Chicago's poorest residents, in particular African-Americans.\nBut just as clearly documented is Mendoza\u2019s outspoken opposition to the sticker price increase Emanuel proposed in his first budget as mayor.\nIt sounded like Vallas was conflating these two pieces of the sticker policy puzzle. So we asked for clarification.\n\"I think it\u2019s a pretty clear statement,\" Vallas said in a phone interview. \"I define what I meant and what I meant was, these draconian fines are bankrupting families. \u2026 I gave the specific example of what Mendoza did that was so egregious and what the impact was.\"\nA Vallas spokesman followed up several hours later to explain the statement his candidate had characterized as \"pretty clear\" needed some clarification.\n\"There was inadvertently a word change,\" spokesman John Holden said, explaining the original draft had called absurd Mendoza\u2019s assertion that she fought Emanuel over sticker policy rather than sticker prices specifically.\nThat was not, however, a distinction Vallas attempted to draw when he discussed the matter with PolitiFact. Holden, while acknowledging a lack of clarity in the initial statement put out in Vallas\u2019 name, said the campaign did not plan to issue a correction.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLori Lightfoot\n\n\nstated on March 5, 2019 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays the percentage of officers the Chicago Police Board fired after hearing their cases or who chose to resign prior to a board hearing roughly doubled during her tenure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Kiannah Sepeda-Miller \u2022 March 10, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, it\u2019s worth noting that while Vallas\u2019 public statement attempts to cherry-pick the part of Mendoza\u2019s city sticker record that casts her in the worst light, Mendoza did some cherry-picking of her own when referencing the sticker issue in her campaign launch announcement.\nBack in 2011, Emanuel prevailed in hiking sticker prices, although he reworked his plan in response to Mendoza\u2019s criticism, opting to spread out a lower increase among all drivers rather than dramatically hiking rates on larger passenger vehicles alone. The city also adopted the kind of increased ticket penalties for sticker scofflaws that Mendoza had pitched as an alternative to an increase in sticker prices. Citations for failing to have a required vehicle sticker jumped from $120 to $200.\nIn the announcement that Vallas ridiculed, Mendoza highlighted only her opposition to higher sticker prices while not mentioning the corresponding increase in violation penalties she backed.\nProPublica Illinois and WBEZ found that debt from sticker tickets soared, compounded by late penalties and collection fees, with drivers collectively racking up $275 million in dollars owed to the city for tickets issued since 2012.\nWe reached out to Mendoza\u2019s campaign to hear how she reconciled her actions on city sticker policy. Spokeswoman Rebecca Evans sent us a response that included a statement from the candidate.\n\"I said long before I announced my candidacy that the city should revisit these penalties and how they are enforced, which overburdens our city\u2019s low-income residents,\" Mendoza said. \"As mayor I plan to do so.\"\nEvans elaborated by calling the comparison between the two issues a \"false equivalency,\" writing that Mendoza\u2019s efforts to halt the sticker price increase and how the city\u2019s Department of Revenue has enforced sticker penalties are separate issues.\nOur ruling\nVallas said, \"Mendoza\u2019s assertion that she fought Rahm Emanuel\u2019s efforts to drastically raise city sticker prices is absurd \u2026 Mendoza pushed a draconian city sticker penalty program.\"\nVallas is correct that Mendoza backed hiking tickets for violating city sticker requirements during her time as city clerk, a policy that has financially burdened thousands of low-income Chicagoans.\nBut he\u2019s off base in calling into question Mendoza\u2019s well-documented opposition to Emanuel\u2019s sticker price increase.\nWe rate his partially accurate statement Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01251"}
