If one person raised their hand we would all look at them in disbelief.\"\n\nMilwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr., who urges citizens to arm themselves to ward off harm, offered his own memories.\n\n\"When I was growing up as a kid in the city of Milwaukee, if we averaged 4 homicides a year in the entire city that was a record number,\" said Clarke, 56. \"So a lot obviously has gone on since then.\"\n\nA good chunk of the sheriff\u2019s childhood overlapped with the 20-year run of Police Chief Harold Breier as Milwaukee\u2019s top cop. Breier called Milwaukee \"the safest city in the nation\" just months before retiring in 1984.\n\nClarke went to work in Breier\u2019s MPD as a patrolman in 1978 at the age of 21, and later worked his way up to homicide detective and various command staff positions. He was appointed sheriff in 2002 and has been re-elected since.\n\nIs Clarke right that homicides were a rarity when he was growing up?\n\nWe took a walk back in time through Milwaukee Police crime stats and news stories to get an answer. Clarke declined to discuss his remarks.\n\nOne of the first news stories we found from the era said that Milwaukee\u2019s 1960 murder rate per capita was lowest of any major city. At the time, Milwaukee was the nation\u2019s 11-largest city (population 741,324).\n\nBut Clarke\u2019s memory for the frequency of homicides was fuzzy. He recalled \"if we averaged 4 homicides a year in the entire city that was a record number.\"\n\nMilwaukee\u2019s lowest annual homicide total in Clarke\u2019s childhood was 12 in 1956, the year he was born.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHomicides tallied in the 20s in most of his first 10 years, and then picked up their pace, totaling 36, 46 and 51 before Clarke\u2019s teen years began.\n\nAnd if you include his early teenage years as part of his time as a \"kid,\" the count had risen sharply to 75 in 1973, when Clarke was 17.\n\nSo, instead of coming in at record-setting lows, as Clarke recalled, homicide was doubling or tripling during his youth.\n\nAs a point of reference, the figure of 75 was higher than the homicide total in both 2008 and 2009. At the same time, that figure looks low when compared with the early 1990s, when homicides hit 160 as crack cocaine and related violence took hold.\n\nThe sheriff, we found, would have better made his point about changes in safety by citing per-capita figures and national rankings.\n\nPolitiFact Wisconsin ran those numbers in March 2013 when analyzing a dispute over homicide figures used by Clarke and Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn.\n\nThe picture is much-changed compared with 1960, when that \u00a0study put the city\u2019s homicide ranking as lowest among the largest cities.\n\nFor starters, the city\u2019s population is now 598,916, a number that dropped it to the 30th-largest U.S. city. And nationally in 2011, Milwaukee\u2019s homicide rate was fifth highestin the country among cities of 500,000 to 999,000 people. And it was 18th-highest of 73 cities, when cities of 250,000 or more were included.\n\nJust looking at Milwaukee over time, the city\u2019s homicide rate in 1960 was eight times lower than the 2010 rate, we found.\n\nOur rating\n\nSpeaking about changes in the crime picture over time, Clarke said, \"When I was growing up as a kid in the city of Milwaukee, if we averaged 4 homicides a year in the entire city that was a record number.\"\n\nThe sheriff\u2019s memory misfired. In reality, homicides ranged from 12 to 75 during Clarke\u2019s pre-adult years, accelerating at a steady clip.\n\nWe rate his claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09146"}
