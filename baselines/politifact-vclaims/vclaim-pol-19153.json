Rather, the company said it identified people associated with Nazi groups.\u00a0\nSo we were skeptical of a supposed breaking news item circulating on Facebook by the end of the week.\u00a0\n\"The FBI just confirmed that it was ANTIFA, not Trump supporters who breached the Capital,\" the post said, misspelling Capitol. \"It\u2019s reported that 2 captured had MAGA hats on as a ruse. Remember who ANTIFA works to promote and how they work. Now, when will you hear a retraction, apology or even this news on CNN? Don\u2019t hold your breath. That\u2019s not their policy.\"\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.

It mentioned neither antifa nor the president\u2019s supporters, but said the FBI is \"seeking information that will assist in identifying individuals who are actively instigating violence in Washington D.C.\"\nAs we\u2019ve previously reported, there\u2019s no way to identify everyone who participated in the mayhem on Jan. 6. But no one claiming that antifa activists stormed the Capitol has provided legitimate proof, while the evidence that Trump supporters were involved is indisputable.\nWe rate this Facebook post Pants on Fire.\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click here, for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19153"}
