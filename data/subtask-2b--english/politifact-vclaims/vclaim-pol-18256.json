Andrew Cuomo. It provides for certain employee benefits if the employee is subject to a mandatory or precautionary order of quarantine or isolation due to COVID-19.\nAmong these benefits is paid sick leave during the government-mandated shutdown of non-essential businesses.\nJacobs voted against the bill.
