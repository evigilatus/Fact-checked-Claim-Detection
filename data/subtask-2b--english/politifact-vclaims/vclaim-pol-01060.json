We decided to check it out. (We reached out to a party representative but did not receive a response.)\nJustice, elected as a Democrat in 2016, took office on Jan. 16, 2017. That month, the unemployment rate in West Virginia was 5.3 percent.\nJustice became a Republican on Aug. 3, 2017. That month, the state unemployment rate stood at 5.2 percent.\nAnd today? In the most recent month available, December 2018, the unemployment rate in West Virginia was 5.1 percent.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs that a dramatic drop?

Because West Virginia\u2019s population is small, he said, the margin of error for the survey used to track the unemployment rate is big enough to produce uncertainty about small changes in the data, like those seen during Justice\u2019s tenure.\n\"The change is statistically insignificant,\" Lego said.\nHe added that regular revisions by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which collects the data, could produce small changes that affect the comparison.\nOur ruling\nThe West Virginia Democratic Party tweeted, \"FACT: Unemployment rate has not decreased since @WVGovernor took office.\"\nThe state unemployment rate did, in fact, decline from 5.3 percent to 5.1 percent on Justice\u2019s watch.
