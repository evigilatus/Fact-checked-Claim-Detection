Lee statue, supporters of Trump are sharing a familiar image created after Lemonis\u2019 August 2017 interview on CNBC with #boycottCampingWorld.\nThe post shows Lemonis\u2019 face next to the Camping World logo with text that says the following:\u00a0\nTo President Donald Trump Supporters:\n\"Frankly, don\u2019t shop at my business.\"\n-Marcus Lemonis CEO\nThis is an exaggeration of what Lemonis said in a CNBC interview. The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

(Trump quickly dissolved the councils.) Trump said of the white supremacists and counterdemonstrators in Charlottesville, \"You had some very bad people in that group, but you also had people that were very fine people, on both sides.\"\nTrump\u2019s comment came Aug. 15, 2017, three days after a man from Unite the Right rammed his car into a crowd after the rally, killing Heather Heyer and injuring 19 others.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRELATED: In Context: Donald Trump\u2019s \u2018very fine people on both sides\u2019 remarks (transcript)\nThe day after Trump\u2019s press conference, Lemonis went on familiar territory at CNBC, where he anchored \"The Profit\" on the same cable channel.\n\nLemonis, who was not a member of a White House advisory council, told the CNBC host he was \"horrified\" by the administration\u2019s response and was concerned about some CEOs \"dancing on the fence\" out of fear. Then the host asked how he would weigh the fear of customer retaliation for criticizing Trump.\n\"There\u2019s no doubt that there is probably not many consumers in this country today that are in favor of what has been said in the last couple days and if they are, quite frankly, don\u2019t shop at my business,\" he said. \"And I think that the reality of it is that there is a fear, a fear of retribution.\"\nThe CNBC headline was born: \"Marcus Lemonis: If you\u2019re OK with what Trump said, don\u2019t shop at my business\"\nReading his comments in context, Lemonis was not telling all Trump supporters not to shop at his store. He was talking about consumers who agreed with what \"has been said in the last couple of days,\" with a focus on Trump\u2019s comments.\nA few days later, Lemonis made a live video to defend himself from the blowback, though he made a revision to what he actually said. \"What I said is that if you were okay with what happened at Charlottesville, with what was said and what was done, I am not OK with it,\" he said. He added he would not change his position no matter how much it hurt him.\nOn Aug. 25, 2017, CNBC reported on Lemonis\u2019 apology for the mistake of \"not being clear.\"\u00a0\n\"As the CEO of a business, I am responsible to take care of the people that work there. I opened my mouth and put them in harm\u2019s way. While I know, that (sic) the headline published was taken out of context and I have to live with that. There should have never been a headline and (sic) I gave a chance to live.\"\nBut #BoycottCampingWorld lives on, boosted by this misleading image.\nThe claim that Lemonis told Trump supporters broadly not to shop at his store has an element of truth, but it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.
