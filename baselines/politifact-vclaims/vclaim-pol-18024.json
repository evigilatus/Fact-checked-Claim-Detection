Bernie Sanders finds himself in hot water with some Democratic members of Congress over his comments about Cuba.\nOn \"60 Minutes,\" Sanders said not everything Fidel Castro did was bad when he took power, singling out a literacy campaign. The criticism came fast, including from Florida\u2019s Republican Sens. Marco Rubio and Rick Scott and some prominent Democrats.\nCNN anchor Chris Cuomo asked Sanders about the reaction in a town hall the next day: \"Now Democratic members of Congress who represent Cuban Americans in Florida \u2014 obviously you've got to win there \u2014 they're attacking your comment as \u2018absolutely unacceptable,\u2019 singing the praises of a murderous tyrant. Response?\"\u00a0\nSanders dismissed the criticism from fellow Democrats during their back and forth.\n\"By the way, all of those congresspeople that you mentioned just so happen to be supporting other candidates, just accidentally, no doubt, coincidentally,\" Sanders said.\nSanders claim suggests \u2014 but doesn\u2019t specify names \u2014 that the members of Congress prefer other candidates. They do seem to prefer anyone but Sanders, but they haven\u2019t made specific endorsements, and they\u2019re officially neutral.\u00a0\nIt was easy to narrow down where the criticism was coming from. There are two Democratic congresswomen from South Florida who had tough words for Sanders, and both used just the words Cuomo described.\nThey are South Florida Reps. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell and Donna Shalala.\nMucarsel-Powell called Sanders\u2019 comments \"absolutely unacceptable.\"\u00a0\nAs the first South American immigrant member of Congress who proudly represents thousands of Cuban Americans, I find Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019 comments on Castro\u2019s Cuba absolutely unacceptable.\u2014 Debbie Mucarsel-Powell (@DebbieforFL) February 24, 2020 \nShalala tweeted, \"I'm hoping that in the future, Senator Sanders will take time to speak to some of my constituents before he decides to sing the praises of a murderous tyrant like Fidel Castro.\"\ndiv class='artembed'>\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin Nunes\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in an interview on Fox\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRepublicans have no way to communicate\u201d after tech companies cut off Parler.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Amy Sherman \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm hoping that in the future, Senator Sanders will take time to speak to some of my constituents before he decides to sing the praises of a murderous tyrant like Fidel Castro. https://t.co/Iwvmay9LOH pic.twitter.com/KT9sQ0pfkh\u2014 Donna E. Shalala (@DonnaShalala) February 24, 2020 \nIn 2018, both women won Miami-Dade districts that were previously held by Republicans and face competitive contests this year. Both Shalala (District 27) and Mucarsel-Powell (District 26) represent districts that have a majority Hispanic population, and around 38% of the population is Cuban.\u00a0\nRELATED: Fact-checking Bernie Sanders' claim on Cuba literacy under Castro\nShalala has donated to Sanders\u2019 opponents\nShalala and Mucarsel-Powell have indicated that they are neutral in the primary. However, both have been skeptical about the possibility of Sanders becoming the party\u2019s nominee.\u00a0\n\"He\u2019s not going to be the nominee,\" Shalala told the Miami Herald in mid February when asked if she would campaign for Sanders should he win the nomination. \"That\u2019s a hypothetical question, and since I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to be the nominee, I don\u2019t have to answer the question.\"\nMucarsel-Powell was more forceful in her response to the Herald: \"I\u2019m seriously considering endorsing another candidate, that\u2019s my answer to you.\"\nA spokesman for Shalala said she will not endorse anyone until after the Florida primary. But she has not held back on donations.\nFEC records show that Shalala gave $1,000 to Sen. Amy Klobuchar\u2019s presidential campaign in recent months, half in December and half in September. She also gave $500 to former Vice President Joe Biden in September.\nIn September 2019, both Shalala and Mucarsel-Powell appeared at a Biden campaign event for Latino voters in Little Havana, a Miami neighborhood. Shalala also attended events in Miami-Dade County for Klobuchar and Bloomberg. (Shalala has long-standing relationships with many Democrats. She was President Bill Clinton\u2019s former Health and Human Services secretary.)\nMucarsel-Powell also has no plans to endorse and remains undecided, her spokesman told us. She has not made any donations to presidential candidates.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nSanders said Democratic members of Congress who represent Cuban Americans in Florida \"just so happen to be supporting other candidates.\"\nNeither woman has endorsed a primary candidate. But they have not shown Sanders any primary love. On top of criticizing Sanders on Cuba, they have publicly cast doubt on whether they would support him as the Democratic nominee. And Shalala has donated $500 to Biden and $1,000 to Klobuchar.\u00a0\nWe rate Sanders claim is partially accurate but lacks important context. We rate it Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18024"}
