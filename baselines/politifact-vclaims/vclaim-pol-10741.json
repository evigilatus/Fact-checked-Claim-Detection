Lou Greenwald sets Truth-O-Meter ablaze with ridiculous description of tax increase proposal", "text": "As much as Assembly Majority Leader Lou Greenwald would like to call it something else, a tax increase is still a tax increase.\n\nA Democrat from Camden County, Greenwald has proposed raising the state income tax rate on taxable income exceeding $1 million, and then using that new revenue to offset property taxes for people earning up to $250,000.\n\nBut that\u2019s not a tax increase, Greenwald claimed in a recent TV interview.\n\n\"First of all, it\u2019s not a tax increase. A tax increase is when you increase a tax that brings in more revenue that you spend in government,\" Greenwald said during a July 15 interview on \"Inside Story\" on Philadelphia-based 6abc.\n\n\"What we\u2019ve offered is to take 16,000 people and have every penny that comes in from them offset property taxes up to 20 percent for 2.6 million filers, the other 8.8 million. So, it\u2019s not a tax increase. It\u2019s a tax shift.\"\n\nGreenwald\u2019s claim doesn\u2019t make any sense, PolitiFact New Jersey found.\n\nFor the last few months, Greenwald has been leading the charge to raise taxes on millionaires in order to provide property tax relief for residents with annual incomes up to $250,000.\n\nThe tax hike was initially tied to a proposed income tax credit based on the amount of property taxes paid. More recently, the increase has been linked to providing roughly $800 million in additional property tax relief payments through the state\u2019s Homestead Benefit Program.\n\nLegislation sponsored by Greenwald -- Assembly Bill A-3201 -- increases the tax rate on taxable income greater than $1 million from 8.97 percent to 10.75 percent. Through a separate piece of legislation sponsored by Greenwald -- Assembly Bill A-3202 -- that additional tax revenue would go toward the higher property tax relief payments.\n\nThe Democrat-led Legislature passed both bills last month, but Gov. Chris Christie vetoed A-3202 outright and conditionally vetoed A-3201. Instead, the Republican governor called on legislators to amend that legislation to implement an income tax credit for homeowners earning up to $400,000 in taxable income.\n\nIn the TV interview, Greenwald offered a definition of a \"tax increase\" to explain how his proposal is not one.\n\nBut that definition -- \"A tax increase is when you increase a tax that brings in more revenue that you spend in government\" -- matches exactly what those two bills would do. One bill would \"increase a tax,\" and the second bill would \"spend\" that extra revenue.\n\nBrian McGinnis, communications director for Greenwald, maintained in an e-mail that the assemblyman\u2019s proposal is a \"tax shift\" that would benefit millionaires as well.\n\n\"When our plan is taking every additional income tax dollar to reduce a local property tax expenditure for 95% of families, it\u2019s a tax shift that ultimately accrues benefits to every family in our state through a lower property tax burden, stabilized property values and increased economic competitiveness,\" McGinnis told us.\n\nThe spokesman added: \"The Majority Leader has frequently talked about the hidden tax on all New Jerseyans being the hit a family\u2019s property values take because property taxes are so high. In providing significant property tax relief to 95% of New Jersey families, our plan would have addressed this problem\u2014helping to stabilize property values and benefiting people throughout the state, including millionaires.\n\n\"Furthermore, as the Majority Leader said in the interview, lower property taxes for the middle-class makes our state a more attractive place to live, meaning millionaires (whom the Governor calls job creators) can attract more talented employees.\"\n\nWe gave Greenwald a False for a related claim from the same interview in this fact-check.\n\nOur ruling\n\nDuring a TV interview, Greenwald offered this description of his proposal to raise the state income tax rate on millionaires and use the extra money to offset property taxes for people earning up to $250,000:\n\n\"It\u2019s not a tax increase. It\u2019s a tax shift.\"\n\nBut despite how the money would be spent, raising any tax rates is clearly a tax increase. Calling such a measure a \"tax shift\" doesn\u2019t make any sense, and Greenwald should know better. So, here\u2019s three more words to add to his vocabulary:\n\nPants on Fire!\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the 2017 tax law, \u201cpeople who make under $75,000 will have their taxes raised in 2021 and every 2 years after that until 2027.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10741"}
