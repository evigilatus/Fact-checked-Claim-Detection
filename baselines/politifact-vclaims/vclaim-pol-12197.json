Now O\u2019Brien is holding secret meetings with big developers.\"", "truth_label": "barely-true", "date": "stated on October 17, 2011 in a political advertisement:", "title": "Sayreville Mayor Kennedy O'Brien blasts Democrats' political ad", "text": "Building permits, secret meetings and big developers \u2013 oh my!\n\nSayreville voters should keep those concerns in mind, if a political mailer circulating in town \u2013 complete with marquee-style lettering and an exclamation point or two -- is to be believed.\n\n\"Since Mayor O\u2019Brien took office Sayreville has issued 22,081 Building Permits! Now O\u2019Brien is Holding Secret Meetings with Big Developers\" reads a large postcard mailed to residents in this small Middlesex County borough. The postcard shows a man attempting to climb a small mountain of paperwork \u2013 presumably applications to build in the borough. A large headshot of O\u2019Brien, a Republican, is in the background. The postcard states that it\u2019s paid for and authorized by the New Jersey Democratic State Committee. O'Brien is seeking re-election to a four-year term. His opponent is Democrat Stanley Drwal.\n\nAlthough the ad doesn\u2019t specifically state it, the inference from the ad is there\u2019s a lot of building going on under O\u2019Brien\u2019s watch. And building can be a dirty verb in New Jersey. For some people, it means more children in schools, more government services needed and less open space \u2013 all costing more tax dollars.\n\nPolitiFact New Jersey checked the claims in the ad and found that the number of building permits issued during O\u2019Brien\u2019s 11-year tenure as mayor is correct \u2013 but only about 5 percent of those were to construct homes. As for secret meetings? That depends on who\u2019s asked.\n\n\"This is a personal attack,\" O\u2019Brien said about the ad. \"It\u2019s personal and it\u2019s misleading. They must think the people of Sayreville are stupid. We only have about 11,000 homes in Sayreville.\"\n\nActually, the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s American Fact Finder survey for 2010 shows Sayreville has 16,393 housing units. The Census Bureau defines a housing unit as \"a house, an apartment, a mobile home or trailer, a group of rooms, or a single room occupied as separate living quarters, or if vacant, intended for occupancy as separate living quarters,\" spokeswoman Stacey Gimbel Vidal said in an email.\n\nAn ad doesn\u2019t have to make a specific statement for its intent to be clear, according to Dr. Terry Madonna, a political science professor at Franklin and Marshall College in Lancaster, Pa.\n\n\"When I look at things I try to look at the whole picture,\" Madonna said. \"What meaning are they trying to convey consciously and subconsciously?\"\n\nThe Democratic State Committee sent an Open Public Records Act request to the borough on Sept. 20, seeking the number of building permits issued in Sayreville from Jan. 1, 2000 to Sept. 20, 2011. O'Brien became mayor in 2000.\n\nKirk Miick, the borough\u2019s construction official and director of code enforcement, said he contacted the organization and asked if a breakdown was wanted of what the permits were for, and was told that just a total number of permits issued was needed.\n\nMiick told PolitiFact New Jersey the borough issued 22,081 permits during the requested timeframe but noted that of those, about 1,240 were for new homes \u2013 single-family residences, condominiums and townhouses. Another 3,026 were for significant additions or modifications to existing houses, while the rest were permits for demolition work, pools, sheds, fences, warehouses, educational facilities and more.\n\nNow, about those \"secret\" meetings.\n\nJason Springer, communications director for the Democratic State Committee, provided us with copies of news stories and a letter from the Middlesex County Prosecutor\u2019s Office relating to a February 2010 incident in which O\u2019Brien showed up at a meeting at the Woodbridge Hilton between Deborah Lee and Robert Kaye of the development firm PRC Group. Lee, an alternate on the Planning Board, was at the meeting as president of the Spinnaker Pointe Homeowners Association. When O\u2019Brien showed up -- unexpectedly, according to Lee -- she asked that the discussion not include matters to be brought before the Planning Board.\n\nA portion of the meeting recorded on tape was later found to have been deleted. The Middlesex County Prosecutor\u2019s Office investigated and determined that a crime had been committed \u2013 tampering with public records and information -- but had no suspects and closed the investigation without filing criminal charges. The prosecutor\u2019s office then made a number of recommendations about better securing future recordings of public meetings.\n\nO\u2019Brien, who owns a sales and marketing agency, said the meeting was not held secretly. O\u2019Brien said he travels frequently for work and often conducts borough business where a meeting is convenient \u2013 a practice he has done since he\u2019s been mayor.\n\n\"If I can meet somebody at a restaurant I\u2019ll meet them at a restaurant, I\u2019ll meet them in a lobby of a hotel on a parkway -- wherever I am and wherever they are, I meet with them, at borough hall and all points in between,\" he said.\n\nO\u2019Brien said Councilwoman Lisa Eicher, a Democrat, filed an ethics complaint against him with the state Department of Community Affairs, regarding the meeting. We checked with the state for the status of the complaint.\n\n\"For reasons of confidentiality, we can neither confirm nor deny the receipt of an ethics complaint,\" DCA spokeswoman Lisa Ryan said in an email. \"Ethics complaints are only subject to public disclosure 30 days after mailing a notice of dismissal or a notice of violation to the individual named in a complaint and the complainant.\"\n\nWe also asked Springer about evidence of other alleged secret meetings that O\u2019Brien supposedly had, since the wording of the mailer indicates more than one, and that such meetings are continuing.\n\n\"If the Mayor told us he was holding additional secret meetings, they wouldn\u2019t be very secret,\" Springer responded in an email. \"However, one has to assume so, otherwise why would someone go through such great lengths to erase evidence of the first meeting.\"\n\nSpringer also questioned the appropriateness of doing borough business outside Sayreville.\n\n\"Meetings with a developer should take place in Borough Hall, not in a hotel in another town,\" he said. \u00a0\"The very nature of the meeting, with the surprise appearance of the Mayor was highly inappropriate. \u00a0And again, if there was nothing to the meeting, why would someone go through such great lengths to erase part of the recording?\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nThe Democratic State Committee sent a mailer to Sayreville residents stating more than 22,000 building permits had been issued in the borough during the incumbent mayor\u2019s tenure, and accused him of having secret meetings with big developers. We confirmed that 22,081 permits were issued, but just 5 percent -- 1,240 --\u00a0of those were for new home construction. O\u2019Brien says a complaint alleging that an out-of-town meeting he attended in February 2010 was unethical was filed with the state DCA, but the agency will neither confirm nor deny that. A spokesman for the Democrats admits assuming Kennedy is having other \"secret\" meetings, but there\u2019s no proof of that allegation. Therefore, we rate this claim Mostly False.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-12197"}
