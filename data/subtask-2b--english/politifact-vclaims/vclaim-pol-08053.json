Paul Ryan, R-Wis., saying it reflected the principles of the Koch brothers and would lower taxes on the wealthy.\n\"Is $80 billion of personal wealth for the Koch brothers enough?\" Reid asked. \"I think most everyone would say yes, it's enough. But not the Koch brothers. They want more. They're the richest people in the world. Individually they're only fifth. Put them together they're the richest in the world.\"\nWe wondered: Is that correct? Reid\u2019s office didn\u2019t respond to an inquiry for this story, but we were able to find some answers.\nIt\u2019s tricky to say definitively who is richer than who, because of privacy issues and fluctuations in market values. But the longstanding yardstick for measuring the world\u2019s richest people comes from Forbes magazine, which publishes both the Forbes 400 (a list of the 400 richest Americans) and the World\u2019s Billionaires (which tracks more than 1,600 billionaires across the globe).\nCurrently, Charles and David Koch, when measured as individuals, are tied for sixth place on the international list, with $40.7 billion each. Combined, their net worth is $81.4 billion, which is higher than the highest-ranking individual on the list -- Microsoft founder Bill Gates, at $77.8 billion. (A third brother, William, has long been estranged from Charles and David, and media accounts about the brothers\u2019 giving patterns generally do not consider him to be part of the \"Koch brothers.\" William is worth an additional $4 billion.)\nSo are Charles and David Koch No. 1 in the world? They\u2019re close--but not quite.\nReid ignored one other family that, collectively, has greater net worth than the Kochs: the Waltons, the heirs to the Walmart fortune. Here\u2019s the rundown, in descending order of their ranking on the Forbes international list:\n9. Christy Walton and family: $38 billion\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10. Jim Walton: $35.6 billion\n11. Alice Walton: $35.1 billion\n12. S. Robson Walton: $35.1 billion\n305. Ann Walton Kroenke: $5.0 billion\n367. Nancy Walton Laurie: $4.2 billion\nTogether, the six Waltons have a net worth of $153 billion -- a little less than double the holdings of Charles and David Koch.\nSo if Reid is going to put together the Koch brothers, it makes sense to combine the wealth of the Walton family as well. And the Walton family\u2019s wealth is bigger.\nOur ruling\nReid said the Koch brothers are \"the richest people in the world. Individually they're only fifth. Put them together they're the richest in the world.\" If you look at families -- which is what Reid is essentially doing -- then Charles and David Koch rank second internationally to six members of the Walton family, at least according to Forbes. That\u2019s still pretty close to the top of the list. We rate his statement Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08053"}
