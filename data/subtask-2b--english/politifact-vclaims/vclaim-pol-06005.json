Trump said the one-time tax of 14.25 percent would raise $5.7 trillion and wipe out the debt. Trump said if the rich were having trouble liquidating their assets they could pay off their tax over 10 years.\nThe New York Daily News featured a photograph of Trump with the words, \"SOAK THE RICH.\"\nExperts at the time bashed Trump\u2019s plan as economically and politically unviable.\n\"I don't think the plan makes much economic sense,\" said Stephen Moore, director of fiscal policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute told the New York Times in 1999. \"The fact is that most people's wealth that has been built up over 10, 20 or 50 years is wealth that has already been taxed.\"\nDaniel Mitchell, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation in 1999 said of Trump\u2019s plan at the time, \"The lunacy of this idea is almost indescribable.\" He raised concerns about the economic consequences including that households would shift assets overseas to try to avoid confiscation.\nTrump calculated that 1 percent of Americans would pay the Trump tax. He proposed that half the savings would go toward middle-class tax cuts and the other half for Social Security.\nA spokeswoman for Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, Hope Hicks, wouldn\u2019t tell us if Trump still supports that plan and said that he will release his current tax plan later in September.\nBut in 2011, talk show host\u00a0George Stephanopoulos asked Trump if he still supported that tax, and Trump said it was no longer viable.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 23, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBiden invested the entire family fortune in Ukraine gas and oil.

I mean, you wouldn't have a deficit, at that time,\" Trump said (though he confused debt and deficit). \"Unfortunately, the world has changed, today you can't do it. Today, and I'm very strongly against tax increases. And the reason I'm-\"\n\"So, you're no longer for that tax?\" Stephanopoulos asked.\n\"No, no. I'm no longer for that tax, no,\" Trump said.\nWould Trump\u2019s tax have broken records? \nMany tax experts told us that indeed Trump\u2019s plan would have been record-breaking in terms of revenue, but they said it was never going to happen and lacked major details.\n\"It certainly would have been the biggest ever simply because of its sheer size -- it was trillions of dollars,\" said Roberton Williams, a fellow at the Tax Policy Center. However, \"it\u2019s a totally crazy idea. ... \u00a0I don't think anybody was taking it seriously -- it was Donald Trump being Donald Trump.\"\nThe United States\u2019 gross domestic product in 1999 was $9.7 trillion, so if Trump\u2019s tax had raised $5.7 trillion, that would have been 59 percent of GDP, said Chris Edwards of the libertarian Cato Institute.\nFederal tax hikes typically are no more than 1 percent of GDP, Edwards said.\n\"The Bush 1990 hike and Clinton 1993 hike were less than 1 percent of GDP over 5 years \u2014 \u00a0whereas Trump\u2019s tax would have been 59 percent one\u00a0time in one year,\" Edwards said.\nPolitiFact previously has looked into the largest tax increases as a percentage of GDP. Topping the list from 1940-2006 was the\u00a0Revenue Act of 1942, which was about 5 percent of GDP.\nRichard Phillips, an expert at the\u00a0Citizens for Tax Justice research group, which aims to require the wealthy to pay their fair share, said that Trump\u2019s one-time tax proposal can\u2019t be compared to conventional tax reform, which typically refers to taxes collected annually.\n\"His estimate was based on a back of the envelope calculation of total wealth of individuals with over $10 million in assets multiplied by the 14.25 percent rate,\" he said. \"There are very real questions as to whether you could plausibly tax all forms of wealth and whether wealthy individuals would be able to take action to shield large swaths of their wealth from taxation.\"\nAdditionally, Trump proposed repealing the estate tax and enacting other tax cuts using the revenue that the federal government would save by no longer paying interest on the national debt. It\u2019s not clear how much those tax cuts would have cost and how much of the tax they would offset over time, Phillips said.\nOur ruling\nBush said, \"Trump proposed enacting the largest tax increase in American\u00a0history.\"\nYes, in 1999, Trump proposed a historically large one-time tax increase. Trump said the tax would have raised $5.7 trillion and wiped out the national debt. It would have applied only to the wealthiest Americans.\nThis claim rates True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06005"}
