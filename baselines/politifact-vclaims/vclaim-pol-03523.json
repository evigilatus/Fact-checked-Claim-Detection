This comparison differs from most, though. Reilly refers to an actual statement from Hitler that deportations in the 1930s were part of a \"military operation.\"\nFor this fact-check, we looked back at the policies of Germany\u2019s Third Reich, and specifically whether Hitler or his inner circle had publicly characterized forced deportations in the 1930s as a military operation.\nNazi Germany\u2019s anti-Semitic policies\nTo begin, we reached out to Reilly\u2019s office to see where the alderman found the source he used for the tweet.\nA staffer told us on background that it\u2019s a well-known fact that soldiers aided with the deportation of Jews and that the military, known as the Wehrmacht, guarded concentration camps. The staffer said the information came from the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM) website.\nWe turned to the museum in order to see whether Hitler actually called the deportation of Jews a \"military operation.\"\nAnti-Semitism grew in the early-to-mid-1930s as the Nazi Party became more powerful. With the help of the Gestapo, the Sutrmabteilungen (Stormtroopers) and the Schutzstaffel (more commonly known as the SS), Hitler\u2019s Germany restricted Jews from having many basic human rights. According to the museum, for six years, Nazi-inspired legislation restricted Jews from entering certain parts of town and stripped them of any meaningful employment. In 1939, many German Jews were being deported to concentration camps.\nAccording to the museum website, the deportations were spurred through the Nisko, or Lublin plan, which were Jewish \"reservations\" in what was then a German-occupied area of Poland. Adolf Eichmann of the Reich Main Security Office (RSHA) coordinated the transfer of roughly 3,500 Jews through the Lublin plan.\nThere were other instances of deportations in the 1930s. The USHMM website notes Germans also were deported three days after the official start of WWII if they spoke out against the war. This was enacted by Reinhard Heydrich, commander of the Security Service.\nHowever, there is no record on the USHMM website of Hitler publicly announcing his intentions for deportations or of him describing them as military operations.\nWhile Hitler often spoke about his goals regarding racial purity, he never actually tied them to his military pursuits, publicly or otherwise.\nAccording to the USHMM, it still is unknown when exactly, during 1941, Hitler officially authorized the Final Solution, the name given to the Nazi Plan to exterminate the Jews. In fact, there still is no trace of a written order from Hitler ordering the deportation of Jews.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis kind of internal secrecy was common in Nazi Germany. The website Holocaust Denial on Trial, a joint project of Emory University and Emory\u2019s Tam Institute for Jewish Studies, cites Heinrich Himmler, the head of the SS, as saying, \"We will never speak of it publicly \u2026 I mean the evacuation of the Jews, the extermination of the Jewish race\u2026This is a page of glory in our history which has never been written and is never to be written.\"\nEvidence of Hitler publicly connecting his military plans to the deportation is lacking, though Reilly\u2019s tweet indicates otherwise. \u00a0\u00a0\nThe Trump comparison\nIn the CNN story Reilly retweeted, Trump called his deportation plan a military operation. When asked to clarify, the White House told CNN the president meant \"military\" as an adjective.\nBut Reilly\u2019s conflation of German deportations in the 1930s and Trump\u2019s plan is an inaccurate premise on its face, said Johannes Evelein, a professor of language and cultural studies at Trinity College in Hartford, Conn.\nReilly\u2019s comparison of Hitler\u2019s deportation raises more differences than similarities, Evelein said.\n\"What we are seeing with Trump\u2019s plan is the deportation of immigrants who came here illegally and being returned back to their original country,\" Evelein said. \"In Hitler\u2019s Germany, actual German citizens were being deported. Trump\u2019s plan is more of a question of who is illegal and who\u2019s not, rather than Hitler\u2019s plan, which gauged which citizens were pure and which ones weren\u2019t.\"\nEvelein says as a general rule he hesitates to compare any figure to Hitler.\n\"I have seen a lot of these comparisons and I understand where they are coming from, but I tend to stay away from the comparison,\" Evelein said. \"I feel others should, too, unless people have the time to develop the point and zero in on a very specific element. It\u2019s very easy to write a tweet and be done.\"\nHe even considers these kinds of comparisons \"dangerous,\" especially when done in a short format like Twitter.\n\"There are limits to how much you can explain yourself,\" Evelein said. \"Given the limited amount of text (on Twitter), it invites a kind of glibness. Oftentimes, it\u2019s provocative. Politically, it seems unwise to do that precisely because you cannot explain yourself.\"\nOur ruling\nA recent tweet from Chicago Ald. Brendan Reilly compared a quote from President Trump to the military aspirations of Adolf Hitler. Trump was quoted as saying his deportation plan is a military operation. Reilly responded in a tweet saying, \"I seem to recall a guy in mid-1930s Germany who said the same thing.\"\nAfter reviewing sources from the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and the Holocaust Denial on Trial website, we could not find any record of Hitler expressly calling his deportation of Jews a military operation. The Nazis were known for keeping their plans secret, and while Hitler spurred the majority of the anti-Semitic rhetoric in Nazi Germany, there are no records expressly describing deportations in the 1930s as a military operation.\nInformation from Trinity College\u2019s Professor Evelein and the Hamburg Institute for Social Research revealed the German army did have a hand in carrying out the deportation of Jews.\nFinally, as Evelein pointed out, there are many differences between Trump\u2019s deportation plan and the plan Hitler carried out, including the criteria for deportation and in the case of European Jews, torture and execution.\nReilly\u2019s statement contains an element of truth but ignores many important facts.\nOverall, we rate this claim Mostly False.\u00a0\n Share the Facts   Politifact    4 7  Politifact Rating: Mostly False  Said Adolf Hitler and Donald Trump have both described deportations as \"a military operation.\"     Brendan Reilly  Chicago Alderman   in a tweet  Friday, February 24, 2017 02/24/2017    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03523"}
