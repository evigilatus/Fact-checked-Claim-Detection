There is an announcement that Donald Trump's wife, Melania, may not be modest enough to be the first woman to start a series of bad exchanges between Trump and Sin. Ted Cruz, who has been talking about the campaign for more than a week. Anderson Cooper on CNN questioned Trump about the announcement during an interview on 29 March in Wisconsin, and Trump questioned his accusation, in March 22, that Cruz was responsible for the photo. \"I didn't start this,\" said Trump Cooper seven days after tweeting. He sent a picture and he knew it was a photo that didn't send a picture. It was anti-tramp. Super P.C. When Cooper Trump asked if he had any evidence that Cruz was behind the announcement, Trump said, \"No. Everybody knows he sent it. He knew people at the PAC. He knew. I would be willing to bet that he wrote the phrase \", a reference to the words that accompanied the naked image of Mrs. Trump, a model, placed on a carpet. \"Meet Melanie Trump, your next first lady,\" said the ad. \"O, you can support Ted Cruz on Tuesday,\" reference to 22 March Utah Primary. \"I didn't send the picture to everyone in Utah. He said \"tramp.\" \"It was his people, who were his friends.\" In order to verify the facts, we'll see if Trump's right that Cruz distributed a Facebook ad containing a nude picture of Trump's wife. Federal law states that political declarations must clearly determine their origin, and this is one that lists the source as a political action committee called making America great. These groups are called \"SuperbC\" because they can spend unlimited amounts of money for or against a candidate or a point of view. The PACs have one major constraint: they cannot coordinate their efforts with the candidate's official campaign, which they are constrained in spending. If Cruz arranges the announcement under the Super BC's auspices, it would be a serious violation of federal law. The super PAC says. ................................................................................................................ ................................................................................................................ The Cruz campaign had nothing to do with this announcement at all. We didn't get the picture or the idea of advertising from them,\" said the Republican Strategy Liz Meyer, which is behind the PAC. The magnificent America, based in Virginia, was founded in December, and reported to be 20,752 contributions up to February, with most of the money spent on a small purchase of airtime in nine states, according to the website of the Federal Election Commission. \"I think that including the money that's come in since our last file, we've raised about $35,000,\" said Meyer. There's also no evidence that the BC is a front for Cruz' campaign. On January 18, 2021, in an interview with the right national radio program, \"China was behind intervention and effort to overthrow our government and elections, electoral fraud.\" By Daniel Funk \u2022 19 January 2021, when we reviewed the page PAC on YouTube, we found four ads, only two of which are the standard length of the broadcast. The \"Pier Buyer\" announcement in January 20, which is clearly made with a reduced budget, contains a light presentation of nine Republican presidential candidates as cereals. Among them is the Bush pocket (\"a good source of experience and fondness.\" The brand you know. \", Ben Carson (\"with the doctor of a very nice man.\" \", Chris Christy (\"100% RDA of saying so as it is.\") And Ted Cruz. In advertising, the shopper buys Trump pills (\"Ensure success and free of charge\" crush the Liberal Foundation!\" \"A coupon inside, and it ends up regretting the purchase. Mormon women targeted \"the only announcements we made for any candidate are the three Facebook announcements we made that targeted Mormons in Utah and Arizona, one of which was in Melania, and one of the least money they had put behind them (about $300, perhaps even less honestly).\" Meyer wrote in an e-mail. In the Melania Declaration, she wrote: \"Only Mormon women between 45 and 65 years of age (if I remember correctly) who live in Utah and Arizona and who define themselves as moderate, provincial or very provincial. \"The shot we used was chosen because of the existence of the handcuffs, which were particularly disturbing to the target audience,\" said Meyer. \"Anyway, there's definitely more exciting footage out there that no doubt is more scandalous than a lot of voters across the political spectrum-- Although the announcements urged voters to support the Texas Senator, only one of two options was currently valid for Trump in the polls in those states. The photo was bought? In an interview on 27 March with ABC News, Trump Cruz claimed or campaigned for Melania's photo rights and gave them to the Super PAC. There's no evidence that Cruz, the campaign, or the Mir Group bought photo rights taken when Trump was friends. \"The image was, at the time we conceived and then created the ad, which has already been republished all over the Internet on many sites,\" said Meyer in the e-mail. The photographer who took the picture of the 2000 photo was published in Britain GQ, Antoine Verglass, told our friends in Factcheck.org that no one called him to buy rights in the photo. The magazine reprinted that picture, along with other photos of the photo, on the 4th of March, under the title, \"The First Lady of the Future? \"Milania Trump's sexy picture.\" \"For Cruz himself,\" said Meyer, \"I think I've met him in gatherings attended by many people perhaps once or twice in my life (and it'll be a while ago), and I haven't talked to him alone.\" We contacted the Trump campaign, but we didn't get a response. Our verdict, Trump, said Cruz was responsible for Racy's announcement, which questioned whether people wanted Melanie Trump to be the First Lady. One of the principles of the Polyte Fah document is that the person who filed the claim is responsible for establishing it. Trump said on CNN he didn't have any real evidence. All the evidence we found suggests that the Declaration is the work of the Political Action Commission, whose objective was to prevent the nomination of Trump. There is no evidence that Cruz is working with that commission, which is illegal. We're assessing Trump's claim as false. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/0c9f8bb38-bbff-4c6b-8ec6-c489e2fbb41", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05178"}
