Kyrsten Sinema \"voted to cut ICE.\"", "truth_label": "half-true", "date": "stated on September 16, 2018 in a Fox News interview:", "title": "Martha McSally's exaggerates Kyrsten Sinema votes on ICE funding", "text": "Immigration enforcement is a top issue for the border state of Arizona, and one that Republican congresswoman Martha McSally has elevated during her campaign for the U.S. Senate.\nIn an interview with Fox News, McSally said that Democratic rival and U.S. Rep. Kyrsten Sinema voted to weaken the federal agency responsible for executing immigration laws within the United States, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\"This is a dangerous agenda coming out of the Democrats, and again my opponent voted to cut ICE. ... I support ICE and my opponent voted for cuts to ICE, voted not to support the Department of Homeland Security,\" McSally said in the interview that aired Sept. 16. \"She is associated with this dangerous agenda, don\u2019t be fooled by it. And that\u2019s a real contrast in this race as well.\"\nMcSally is on the House Homeland Security Committee and chairs the Border and Maritime Security Subcommittee.\nIs it true that Sinema \"voted to cut ICE\"? There\u2019s truth to McSally\u2019s claim, but it leaves out important details.\nKey takeaways\n\u2022\u00a0Sinema voted to shift funds from ICE to other agencies.\n\u2022\u00a0However, Sinema also voted to increase ICE\u2019s funding in fiscal year 2018 and, like McSally, voted in favor of a resolution supporting ICE.\n\u2022\u00a0Sinema said abolishing ICE \"isn\u2019t realistic and it doesn\u2019t make any sense.\"\nMcSally spotlights Sinema\u2019s September 2017 votes\nMcSally\u2019s campaign said Sinema was among Democrats who voted in favor of an amendment to an appropriations bill for fiscal year 2018. That amendment, sponsored by Rep. Lou Correa, D-Calif., sought to reduce ICE funding by $100 million and give that money to the U.S. Coast Guard. (The amendment failed.)\nCorrea argued on the House floor that the Coast Guard should use the money for additional ships to interdict drugs coming to the United States by sea. Despite record-breaking efforts against drug trafficking, the Coast Guard\u2019s cocaine seizures accounted for less than 10 percent of all attempted shipments, Correa said.\nThe $100 million represented \"additional support for our border security, our high seas,\" Correa said. He was responding to Rep. John Carter, R-Texas, who argued that the Coast Guard program was already robust and ICE money should go toward the detention of immigrants.\nSinema\u2019s campaign argued that the $100 million redirection would have reduced an overall increase in ICE funding, but not necessarily cut it.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat September, Sinema also voted in favor of a motion introduced by Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, to recommit a bill to the House Appropriations Committee. The intention was to get the committee to amend the bill by allocating $2.4 billion to FEMA\u2019s National Pre-Disaster Mitigation Fund.\nAbout $840 million would have come from ICE\u2019s budget and $1.6 billion from U.S. Customs and Border Protection's allocation for border barriers. (The motion failed.)\nJackson Lee argued that instead of funding a border wall and ICE detention facilities, more money was needed for pre-disaster funding, especially in light of Hurricane Harvey's aftermath in Texas and Louisiana.\n\"We do not need another 10,000 beds in ICE detention centers; but we do need more than 10,000 beds in evacuation shelters,\" said Jackson Lee.\nSinema\u2019s counter argument\nIn spite of those votes, Sinema\u2019s spokeswoman Helen Hare said McSally\u2019s claim ignores a big part of the story.\nSinema voted in favor of a 10 percent funding increase for ICE, compared to fiscal year 2017.\nSinema over her years in Congress also has voted in favor of other appropriation bills funding ICE, her campaign said.\nMoreover, Sinema was one of 18 Democrats who voted in favor of a July resolution stating explicit support for ICE officers and personnel\u00a0and denouncing calls to abolish the agency. Most Democrats voted \"present.\"\nThat measure came to the floor as Republican House leaders sought to put Democrats on the record regarding their position on ICE.\nSinema in July also\u00a0told azfamily.com that \"abolishing ICE isn\u2019t realistic and it doesn\u2019t make any sense.\" While the agency removed criminal immigrants, Sinema said, \"most Americans would agree that we could use some reform.\"\nOur ruling\nMcSally said Sinema \"voted to cut ICE.\"\nMcSally\u2019s evidence are votes Sinema cast on measures seeking to take funds away from ICE to give them to FEMA and the Coast Guard.\nBut McSally\u2019s claim ignores Sinema\u2019s broader voting record. Sinema has also voted to increase funds for ICE and cast a vote supporting ICE and denouncing calls to eliminate the agency.\nMcSally\u2019s claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details.
