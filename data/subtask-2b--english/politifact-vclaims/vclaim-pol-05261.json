We have more kids now than ever before. \u2026 We need to invest in our families.\"\nIt\u2019s not the first time Rendon has used child care to argue for greater state budget investments.\nIn January of this year, he told reporters: \"We\u2019ve cut about $1.2 billion out of child care and I think we need to put that money back in. We\u2019ve gotten about a quarter of the way in terms of restoring those funds. But restoring more funds to early childhood education is something that\u2019s very important to me.\"\nTaking a more conservative approach, Gov. Jerry Brown has declined to restore social service funding as rapidly as many Democrats in the Legislature would like.\nBut in recent budgets, the four-term Democratic governor has agreed to pour hundreds of millions of dollars back into programs slashed during the recession.\nThat made us wonder, was Rendon right when he said the state has reinvested just $300 million in child care? Or has California done more?\nWe decided to check the facts.\n\nAssembly Member Eduardo Garcia, left, congratulates Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon on his inauguration March 7, 2016. Andrew Nixon / Capital Public Radio\nOur research\nFirst, it\u2019s important to define what\u2019s meant by \u2018child care.\u2019\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin Nunes\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in an interview on Fox\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRepublicans have no way to communicate\u201d after tech companies cut off Parler.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Amy Sherman \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor lawmakers and budget analysts at the Capitol, and for early education advocates across the state, \u2018child care\u2019 is a huge umbrella term. It includes subsidized child care programs for infants and toddlers of low-income working parents and preschool for older children.\n\nThere\u2019s no debate that California slashed more than $1 billion in funds for these programs during the recession. Those cuts eliminated child care and preschool for tens of thousands of working families.\nCuts to child care alone totaled nearly $1.1 billion between the fiscal years of 2007-08 to 2011-12, according to budget estimates from the Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office. That\u2019s not quite the $1.3 billion that Rendon stated this month, but it\u2019s close.\nHistorical Child Care And Development Funding\nCreate your own infographics\nWhen looking at reinvestments in the child care system as a whole, the state has put back more than $578 million, according to the Department of Finance, which is part of the Brown Administration. Taking a more narrow look at what can be defined as child care, Brown\u2019s finance team said the state has still pumped more than $450 million back.\nBoth figures are far more than Rendon\u2019s $300 million reinvestment total.\nWe asked Rendon to explain his number. His spokesman said Rendon was speaking strictly about child care services, not preschool.\nOf the $1.1 billion in child care cuts, under this strict view, the state has reinvested a figure matching Rendon\u2019s total -- $303 million -- over the past two fiscal years in childcare programs, according to budget estimates from the Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office.\nThat figure, however, excludes $151 million reinvested under a preschool category that Brown\u2019s finance team described as \"wraparound child care,\" which gives preschool students a full day of care.\nAn independent expert we spoke with said it was strange that Rendon would ignore the preschool component, but agreed it was possible he was using the much stricter definition of child care funding.\nOne advocate for early childhood education suggested Rendon may have been highlighting the fact that while California has made \"huge strides\" in investing in preschool, it\u2019s not done the same for child care.\n\"It\u2019s a tale of two different parts of the system when you think about what\u2019s been put back in,\" said Erin Gabel, deputy director of First 5 California, a state commission that advocates for health and education programs for children up to the age of 5.\nWith the push to provide preschool for all of California\u2019s eligible four year olds, state preschool funding has more than tripled from the recession to the current fiscal year, according to budget figures.\nGabel said child care programs for children under age 2, meanwhile, have seen \"almost no restoration\" from cuts during the recession.\nWhile there are questions about the numbers Rendon used, experts we contacted agreed that Rendon is correct that California \"is nowhere close\" to restoring all the child care funds cut during the recession.\nOur ruling\nCalifornia Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon said recently that the state cut $1.3 billion in child care programs during the recession and has reinvested only $300 million since. His spokesman told us Rendon was speaking strictly about child care programs, not preschool funding.\nExperts agree that more than $1 billion was cut to the child care system. An analysis of budget data shows the total cut from just child care programs was closer to $1.1 billion, a bit less than Rendon\u2019s total.\nA very strict look at how much has been reinvested shows California put back $303 million of that $1.1 billion just to child care programs. The state Department of Finance, however, says the total is more than $450 million because some preschool funding actually pays for child care.\nWe believe this is an important point for those who crunch budget numbers at the Capitol. But we don\u2019t feel it\u2019s enough to say Rendon was intending to deceive the general public.\nWe rate his statement Mostly True because it\u2019s accurate but needs clarification and additional information.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05261"}
