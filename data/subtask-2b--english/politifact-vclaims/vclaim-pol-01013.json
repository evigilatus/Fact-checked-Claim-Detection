Evers flipped on raising minimum wage", "text": "The 2018 gubernatorial campaign featured plenty of spirited debate between Republican Gov. Scott Walker and Democratic challenger Tony Evers.\nAmong the flash points: The state\u2019s minimum wage.\nEvers, who defeated Walker, backed raising the state minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $15 an hour, though with a lower minimum for teenagers and workers in rural areas.\nIndeed, his position was spelled out on his website:\n\"Tony supports raising the minimum wage to $15/hour and indexing to inflation. However, like Senator Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, Tony also believes that this should be phased in over multiple years.\"\nHas Evers already backed off such a central promise weeks into his term?\nThat was the claim made Jan. 8, 2019 by the Republican Party of Wisconsin, which cited an article by the Maclver Institute headlined: \"Evers has pulled an about-face on several campaign promises.\"\nSeems like a good time to return to our Flip-O-Meter, which we use to gauge whether a politician has changed his or her position. Our requisite reminder: We are not rating whether any change is good (or bad) politics or policy -- just whether the politician has been consistent.\nWe have already used the Flip-O-Meter to look at whether Evers has shifted his position on directing the attorney general to withdraw Wisconsin from the pre-existing conditions lawsuit (Rating: Full Flop) and on dissolving the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. in his first budget (Rating: Full Flop).\nWhat about Evers and his support for a $15 minimum wage?\nHas his position changed?\nThe evidence\nIn the article, the MacIver Institute, a conservative think tank based in Madison, cited two Evers statements to declare he had flip-flopped on the minimum wage.\nThe MacIver article quoted a statement from an October 2018 rally featuring Sanders at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, in which Evers said: \"We\u2019re going to $15 an hour minimum.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Steineke\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembly Republicans \u201chave come to the table\u201d and were part of \u201cgive and take\u201d compromise on a coronavirus bill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s pretty clear. And consistent with his campaign platform.\nAs evidence Evers has backed off the $15 promise, the article cites an interview he did with the Wisconsin State Journal posted Jan. 3, 2019.\nThe lead of the State Journal article states: \"Democratic Gov.-elect Tony Evers says he expects his first state budget plan to offer a \u2018clear pathway\u2019 to increase the state\u2019s $7.25 minimum wage.\"\nFrom lower in the article:\nEvers declined to say how, or how much, his budget would propose to increase the state\u2019s minimum wage, which now is as low as permitted under federal law: $7.25 an hour. He said only \"there will be a clear pathway found in the budget to get to\" an increase.\n\nDuring the campaign Evers supported a gradual increase to a $15 minimum wage. He told the State Journal editorial board in October that he\u2019s open to exceptions to a $15 wage in rural areas and for teenage workers.\n\nSuch a plan likely would meet with opposition from the Republican-controlled Legislature, which has resisted minimum-wage hikes embraced in neighboring states.\n\nOf the states bordering Wisconsin, only Iowa has a $7.25 minimum wage. Illinois\u2019 minimum is $8.25 an hour, Michigan\u2019s is $9.25 and Minnesota\u2019s is $9.65 for large employers and $7.87 for small ones, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\nTo critics, this is evidence of a shift in position. The MacIver article notes \"While his first budget will offer a \u2018clear pathway\u2019 to raising the wage, Evers declined to say how, or how much, his budget would propose to increase the state\u2019s minimum wage.\"\nIn our view, this is not a switch at all.\nEvers\u2019 platform talked about the need to phase in an increase -- it did not call for an immediate jump to the $15 level. And, in any case, the budget at hand covers a two-year period, or roughly the first half of his term. It\u2019s not Evers\u2019 only shot to accomplish his goal.\nIndeed, when we contacted Britt Cudaback, Evers\u2019 deputy communications director, she said the governor has not backed off his pledge.\n\"The Governor indicated he thinks we can get to $15 by the end of his first term,\" Cudaback said in an email. \"The article isn\u2019t reporting that the Governor won\u2019t be trying to raise the wage or that the Governor no longer supports a $15 minimum wage, just that the Governor declined to say exactly \u2018how, or how much\u2019 it would be increased in his budget, which he\u2019ll be introducing on February 28.\"\nOur rating\nThe state Republican Party and the MacIver Institute have accused Evers of shifting his position on raising the state\u2019s minimum wage. Has he?\nThe evidence is beyond slim.\nEvers has long talked of phasing in an increase. Not telegraphing how much he might move to increase it in his first budget is not evidence that he no longer wants to increase it at all.\nWe rate this one a No Flip.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01013"}
