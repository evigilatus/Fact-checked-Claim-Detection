Jefferson Smith said at the debate that mayors should guard against boondoggles. PolitiFact Oregon totally agrees with Smith that boondoggles are bad. But our ears perked up at what he said next. \n\n\"The most important principle, I think, for a mayor is to be on boondoggle watch,\" he said. \"Is to make sure that if somebody is trying to build a set of water treatment plants to cure us from cryptosporidium we don\u2019t have, we don't say yes even if CH2M Hill wants us to.\"\n\nLast time we looked, the city did find cryptosporidium in our drinking water. Not a lot, but there were traces.\n\nMore importantly, we think, the City of Portland agreed to build a treatment plant to guard against cryptosporidium not because of a contractor but because the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency demanded it. (We no longer have to build as of March.)\n\nCH2M Hill, an engineering and construction company, certainly has been involved with the Water Bureau. The company would have gotten a piece of the contract for the UV treatment system we no longer have to build.\n\nWe asked Smith to comment. And he said of course he didn\u2019t mean to imply that CH2M Hill was behind the treatment mandate; he knows it came from the federal government.\n\nThe broader point he was trying to make \"is the power behind these big projects can be immense\" and it can be far too easy for government to make decisions based on what powerful interest groups want rather than what\u2019s important to the public.\n\nCertainly, large companies have the power to cajole officials into making some projects more important than others. But that\u2019s not what Smith said at the debate. To the casual listener, Smith said that we don\u2019t have cryptosporidium but we\u2019re building plants to treat for it because a corporation wants us to.\n\nWe find the statement False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEileen Brady\n\n\nstated on April 30, 2012 in a debate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays we could have saved ourselves the cost of building the Powell Butte water reservoir.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Janie Har \u2022 May 5, 2012", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11155"}
