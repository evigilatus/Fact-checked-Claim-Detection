We have drones and sensors. We have dramatically increased the amount of money we spent on border security, adding Smith to the Committee's hearing in January 29. The border between the United States and Mexico extends about 2,000 miles and has barriers of approximately 700 miles; drones and sensors are also used to monitor the border. Has the number of border patrol personnel quadrupled since 2005? No. The number has increased significantly, but not as much as Smith claimed. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection have electronic data on the staffing of border patrols by fiscal year, 1992 to 2017. In 2005, there were approximately 11,300 border patrol personnel throughout the country. Approximately 10,000 jobs on the south-west border. In 2017, there were some 19,400 border patrol personnel throughout the country. Some 16,600 people work on the south-west border. On February 1, 2021, Tom Cotton mentioned in an interview with Fox and friends \"Many of these arriving immigrants, we have no way of checking their background for either health or security.\" By Miriam Valverdi, 3 February 2021, Customs and Border Protection, Politi Fact said that it now has about 20,000 border patrol personnel. The number of persons on the south-west border has not been determined, but historical data show that the vast majority of them are sent to the south-west border. The number of border patrol personnel throughout the country peaked in 2011 at approximately 21,400 (within the time frame of 1992-2017), but remains less than fourfold. The spokesman for Smith Rebecca Bryant, who was contacted by Politifakt, said that Congressman had misspoked and that border patrol staffing levels were more than double, not quadruple in 2005. The Border Patrol continues to be understaffed, despite the increase in the number of staff recruited. It strives to retain agents who see a lack of mobility and better opportunities elsewhere, according to a federal report issued in 2018. Smith's remarks came at a time when legislators were working on a deal to finance the Government and to avoid another closure in mid-February. Trump wants $5.7 billion for a border wall with Mexico; however, Democrats are reluctant to provide this amount for the wall, favouring other security measures. Our referee Smith claimed, \"Go back to 2005 so far, we've quadrupled the number of border patrol personnel.\" Government data show that the number of border patrol personnel has almost doubled, and not quadrupled from 2005 to current levels. Smith's statement is inaccurate. We assess it wrong.
