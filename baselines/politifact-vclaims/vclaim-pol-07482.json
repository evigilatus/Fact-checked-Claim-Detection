One of his latest messages revives the inaccurate claim that President Barack Obama let the head of Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) slip through our fingers in 2009.\nISIS, which has simplified its name to Islamic State, is the well-armed Sunni force that has claimed broad swaths of land in Iraq. Recently, it defeated seasoned, if ill-equipped, Kurdish forces in battles for two key towns.\nOn Aug. 5, Woods, no fan of Obama, tweeted to his 145,000 followers, \"The leader of ISIS was imprisoned by American troops and ordered released to Iraq by Obama administration in 2009.\"\nWoods followed that up with, \"Clearly Obama did not hand select the leader of ISIS for release to the Iraqis in 2009. Obama's weak kneed foreign policy is the issue.\"\nWe looked at an almost identical claim about the head of Islamic State, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in June.\nBaghdadi was held by U.S. forces at a detention facility in Iraq called Camp Bucca, but not when Woods said. According to the Defense Department, Baghdadi was released in 2004, not 2009.\n\"Ibrahim Awad Ibrahim Al Badry, also known as 'Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi'\u00a0was held as a 'civilian internee'\u00a0by U.S. Forces-Iraq from early February 2004 until early December 2004, when he was released,\" the Pentagon told us in a statement. \"He was held at Camp Bucca. A Combined Review and Release Board recommended 'unconditional release'\u00a0of this detainee and he was released from U.S. custody shortly thereafter. We have no record of him being held at any other time.\"\nIn short, according to the Defense Department, the man who heads Islamic State was set free in 2004, long before Obama took office, and he was not recaptured.\nHow did the 2009 version get started?\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn mid June, there were several articles -- from Slate, and NBC among others -- \u00a0that placed Baghdadi at Camp Bucca in 2009 (when Obama would have been president). However, all the talk tracked back to a Daily Beast interview with Army Col. Kenneth King, the former commander of Camp Bucca. That article said King knew Baghdadi at the camp and that he didn\u2019t expect to see him become the leader of a spectacularly vicious and brutal movement.\n\"I'm not surprised that it was someone who spent time in Bucca but I'm a little surprised it was him,\" King said. \"He was a bad dude, but he wasn't the worst of the worst.\"\nIn this storyline, Baghdadi was handed over to Iraqi justice system late in 2009 shortly before Camp Bucca closed.\nABC News questioned King\u2019s recollection, citing a \"a U.S. official\" that Baghdadi was not in American custody in 2009.\n\"I could be mistaken,\" King told ABC News, \"but I\u2019m 99 percent. He\u2019s a dead ringer for the guy I had the run-in with \u2026 His face is very familiar.\"\nKing declined to comment to PunditFact.\nFor the record, even if King's memory is better than the Defense Department's paper trail, Obama didn\u2019t order Baghdadi released as much as enforce an agreement brokered by President George W. Bush. Before Bush left office, his administration signed a contract between the United States and Iraq that guaranteed that the United States would give up custody of virtually every detainee.\nOur ruling\nWoods said Obama ordered the release of the leader of ISIS, now called Islamic State, in 2009. The Defense Department says the release took place in 2004 and Obama had nothing to do with it.\nWe rate the claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07482"}
