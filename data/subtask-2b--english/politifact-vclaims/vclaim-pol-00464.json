There\u2019s a hacking conference that\u2019s held every year in Las Vegas, where I think a 14- or 15-year old-girl from Florida hacked into a replica of Florida\u2019s election system in less than 15 minutes.\"\nWhat we found is some indication of vulnerability \u2014 even if it\u2019s not a direct threat to the voting system itself. At least one kid did do some quick hacking.\u00a0\nBut two points are problematic for Gabbard\u2019s claim.\nFirst, there wasn\u2019t hacking into a replica of the election system\u00a0\u2014 but rather a website made to look like Florida\u2019s Secretary of State website that reports preliminary election results. In other words, not the system that receives and counts actual votes.\nAnd second, what was hacked into was not even a replica \u2014 as in an exact copy\u00a0of the website \u2014 because it did not contain the proprietary security features that the Secretary of State website has.\nAs the National Association of Secretaries of State said at the time:\n\"While it is undeniable websites are vulnerable to hackers, election-night reporting websites are only used to publish preliminary, unofficial results for the public and the media. The sites are not connected to vote counting equipment and could never change actual election results.\"\nRussia hacking in Florida\nBesides being a large swing state, Florida is important because Russian hackers gained access to at least one Florida county\u2019s election computer network during the 2016 presidential campaign, according to Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report on Russian interference in that campaign. The county was not named.\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis has said two local election offices were hacked ahead of the 2016 election, but that he is not allowed to name the counties.\u00a0\nThe Republican governor has emphasized that while the counties had experienced \"intrusion into the supervisor of election networks,\" no information was manipulated or changed, and that it\u2019s possible they obtained voter information that was public record anyway.\nGabbard\u2019s evidence\nTo support Gabbard\u2019s statement, her campaign sent us two news articles about DEFCON 26, a hacking and cybersecurity event held in Las Vegas in August 2018. As part of the annual event, kids ages 8 to 16 could try to hack into what DEFCON described as replicas of election websites of 13 battleground states, including Florida.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHogan Gidley\n\n\nstated on January 17, 2021 in a Fox News interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump \u201ccan\u2019t say anything (about the U.S. Capitol riot) because the platforms have removed him.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 18, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne article said an 11-year-old boy hacked into the website that was made to look like the Florida Secretary of State\u2019s website; and the other article said an 11-year-old girl hacked into one of the sites, but didn\u2019t indicate which state. Both were done in under 15 minutes. (The home states of the kids were not named.)\nAs DEFCON said, the purpose was not nefarious: \"By exposing the cyber vulnerabilities of these websites, young contestants will compete for prizes in a number of categories, including proposing the best plan to defend the Secretary of State websites from cyber attacks.\"\nBut to be clear: While the websites might report election results and have other voting information, they are not used to receive or count actual votes.\nOne of the articles, from PBS Newshour, said an 11-year-old boy hacked into a version of the Florida state election website and changed voting results in under 10 minutes. And an 11-year-old girl tripled the number of votes on the same site in about 15 minutes.\nIn other words, hacking into a state\u2019s election website could cause confusion if results were manipulated. But that is not the same as hacking into an election system and actually changing votes.\nAnd with regard to how closely the hacked websites matched the actual websites, ProPublica published an article shortly after the DEFCON convention emphasizing that the websites hacked by the kids were not actual replicas of the state election websites.\u00a0\n\"Instead, students were working with look-alikes created for the event that had vulnerabilities they were coached to find,\" ProPublica said. \"Organizers provided them with cheat sheets, and adults walked the students through the challenges they would encounter.\"\nJosh Franklin, an elections expert formerly at the National Institute of Standards and Technology and a speaker at DEFCON, was quoted as saying the websites were \"fake.\"\n\"When I learned that they were not using exact copies and pains hadn\u2019t been taken to more properly replicate the underlying infrastructure, I was definitely saddened,\" he said.\nSimilarly, Vice.com reported after Gabbard\u2019s interview that DEFCON organizers had given the participants \"clones\" of state election websites \"with vulnerabilities inserted by the organizers. In particular, the sites were designed to be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks, one of the most ancient\u2014and yet still very common\u2014hacks ever.\"\nOur ruling\nGabbard said, \"There\u2019s a hacking conference that\u2019s held every year in Las Vegas, where I think a 14- or 15-year old-girl from Florida hacked into a replica of Florida\u2019s election system in less than 15 minutes.\"\nIn less than 15 minutes, two 11-year-olds attending a 2018 hacking convention were able to hack into a website that was made to look similar to the website of the Florida Secretary of State\u2019s Office that reports election results.\nDespite news reports that used terms such as replica and facsimile, the hacked site was not a copy of the Florida site and did not contain the same security features. Moreover, the site that the hackers meant to target does not include the system that is used for receiving and tabulating actual votes.\nGabbard\u2019s loose recollection could leave readers with the wrong impression about the vulnerability of Florida\u2019s election system.
