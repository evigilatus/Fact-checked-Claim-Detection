While the discussion on arms control focused largely on the collective ceasefire, Miaris says that the greatest value of his bill could be that it would prevent some people from shooting at themselves. \"On average, 65% of all gun deaths in America are suicide,\" he said during the August 14 interview on John Frederick's show, a conservative radio broadcast. \"This is one step we can take, in my opinion, to prevent people from hurting themselves. \"It's not just about some mass massacre.\" We've verified his claim that suicides account for 65% of gun deaths in the United States. The latest information comes from an annual report issued in June 2019 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It's called \"Death, Final Data 2017.\" According to the data, there were 38,882 firearms deaths in 2017, and 23,854 suicides. This amounts to 61.4 per cent - slightly below the Miari number. In addition to suicides, statistics showed that 14,542 (37.4 per cent) of the killings of armed men were homicides and 486 (1.2 per cent) accidental killings. Because Miares began his statement by saying, \"On average,\" we calculated 10 years of statistics - from 2008 to 2017. There were 335,746 deaths by firearms and 208,287 suicides. This is an average of 62% again, and it's a little lower than the current figure. Over 10 years, 335,746 rifles and 208,287 suicides were reported to the CDC. That's 62%. We asked Miaris for his 65% claim and sent us an article in a magazine published in Atlantic on December 21, 2018. The article, referring to the data of the Centre for Disease Control, said that \"suicide accounts for 60 per cent of the country's weapons deaths.\" On January 12, 2021, he wrote in an Instagram article saying that Joe Biden remained silent about the violence in Black Lives-Mite protests. \u2022 16 January 2021, from 2008 to 2017, more than half of all firearms suicides were committed, according to the Centre for Disease Control. The number of annual suicides increased by 36 per cent - from 18,223 to 23,8545. Annual suicides with weapons increased by 30 per cent, from 18,223 to 23,854. The Red Flag Act has been advocated by a number of legislators in the State of Virginia - most of them Democrats - for the Red Flag Act, predicting that it would reduce armed violence. At least 15 states have enacted such measures. In Virginia, Democrats introduced this winter bill, which would have allowed law enforcement officials to ask a judge to declare a person a \"high risk\" to himself or others and to order the police to confiscate his weapons for 14 days. Within that period, the person was entitled to be heard to refute the charges against him. If the judge found the charges credible, he could have ordered the weapons held for renewable periods of 180 days. The Republicans in control of the House of Representatives subcommittee defeated the bill on voting 4.2. The weapons activists complained that the measures allowed for weapons to be taken without due process. Myares says his bill addresses this concern. This requires an expert in mental health to assess the person concerned and bring him before a judge, with the opportunity to defend himself, before his firearm can be taken for renewable periods of 14 days. This measure is expected to be considered by the General Assembly in November. Our rule, Miares, in promoting the Red Science Bill, said, \"On average, 65% of gun deaths in America are suicide.\" It's a little overlooking in a sad state. Data from the CDC showed that 62 per cent of rifle deaths from 2008 to 2017 were suicides. We're mostly assessing his statement right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00248"}
