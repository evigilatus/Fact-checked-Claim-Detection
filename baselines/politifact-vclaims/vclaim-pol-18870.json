Trump aggressively pushed back, rejecting the article\u2019s conclusion that he had, on multiple occasions, disparaged those serving in the military, particularly service members who had been wounded or killed.\nOne of the claims in the article, which is based on anonymous sources, was about Trump\u2019s private remarks about the late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. Trump and the 2008 Republican presidential nominee often tangled, including over McCain\u2019s pivotal vote against a bill that would have overturned much of the Affordable Care Act.\nThe article by Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg reads:\n\"Trump remained fixated on McCain, one of the few prominent Republicans to continue criticizing him after he won the nomination. When McCain died, in August 2018, Trump told his senior staff, according to three sources with direct knowledge of this event, \u2018We\u2019re not going to support that loser\u2019s funeral,\u2019 and he became furious, according to witnesses, when he saw flags lowered to half-staff. \u2018What the f--- are we doing that for? Guy was a f---ing loser,\u2019 the president told aides.\"\nAfter the article was published, Trump took to Twitter to reject its reporting, including what he said about McCain.\nOver three linked tweets, Trump wrote,\u00a0\n\"I was never a big fan of John McCain, disagreed with him on many things including ridiculous endless wars and the lack of success he had in dealing with the VA and our great Vets, but the lowering of our Nations American Flags, and the first class funeral he was given by our Country, had to be approved by me, as President, & I did so without hesitation or complaint. Quite the contrary, I felt it was well deserved. I even sent Air Force One to bring his body, in casket, from Arizona to Washington. It was my honor to do so. Also, I never called John a loser and swear on whatever, or whoever, I was asked to swear on, that I never called our great fallen soldiers anything other than HEROES. This is more made up Fake News given by disgusting & jealous failures in a disgraceful attempt to influence the 2020 Election!\"\n....John a loser and swear on whatever, or whoever, I was asked to swear on, that I never called our great fallen soldiers anything other than HEROES.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 4, 2020 \nHere, we\u2019ll focus on Trump\u2019s assertion that he \"never called (McCain) a loser.\"\nThe reality is that Trump did say that about McCain in a widely noted public event in 2015.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

Here\u2019s the full video, with the remarks in question coming at about the 5:10 mark.\nAfter Trump recalled McCain saying something that Trump considered an insult to him and his supporters, \"I said, 'Somebody should run against McCain,' who has been, in my opinion, not so hot. And I supported him for president! I raised a million dollars for him. That's a lot of money! I supported him. He lost. He let us down. But he lost. So I never liked him much after that, because I don't like losers.\"\nAmid audience laughter, the moderator, Republican pollster Frank Luntz, then interjected, \"But he's a war hero!\"\nTrump responded, \"He\u2019s not a war hero. He\u2019s a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren\u2019t captured.\"\nLater that day, Trump retweeted, with seeming approval, a web post headlined \"Donald Trump: John McCain Is \u2018A Loser,\u2019\" that recapped his exchange at the summit.\nVia @fitsnews: \u201cDonald Trump: John McCain Is \u2018A Loser\u2019\u201d http://t.co/sgiETvdUqi\u2014 Donald J.
