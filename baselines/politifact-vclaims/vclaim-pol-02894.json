Facebook users tagged the story as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network\u2019s efforts to fight fake news.\nThe article said Hart, 38, lost control of his car in Summerlin, Nev., on Monday night, corresponding to the first time we saw the post on Sept. 18, 2017. Summerlin is a planned community west of Las Vegas.\nThe post said Hart had been exceeding the 25 mph speed limit and went off the road, hitting a guardrail. Hart was allegedly taken to MountainView Hospital, a real hospital in Summerlin, and remained in critical condition.\nThis accident never happened, mind you, because the post is fake.\nThe photo the website used was of a 2010 accident in Montana, in which a college student had fallen asleep and hit a guardrail that speared his car but missed the driver by inches.\nThere have been no reports that Hart was in any car accident, let alone was injured. He has been posting on social media accounts since then, which the fake post actually used in its writeup of the bogus crash.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second half of the NYDailyNews-TV.com post went on about how Hart had confessed online the day prior about how he had made a \"bad error in judgment\" that had affected his family and made him a target of extortion.\nHart had posted an Instagram video on Sept. 16 with the caption, \"Sending so many apologies to my wife & kids. I gotta do better and I will. I'm not perfect and have never claimed to be ...I love you all.\"\n    Sending so many apologies to my wife & kids. I gotta do better and I will.

It\u2019s another fake news site, without any contact information, posing as a real news source, like others we\u2019ve encountered. While it tries to capitalize on the name recognition of the tabloid New York Daily News, that real newspaper\u2019s website is actually NYDailyNews.com.\nThe story evoked a real celebrity scandal to bolster a completely fake car accident to draw traffic to a website masquerading as a well-known newspaper.\nWe rate this claim Pants On Fire!\n Share the Facts 2017-09-19 19:44:06 UTC   PolitiFact    1 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Pants on Fire  https://nydailynews-tv.com/breaking-us-comedian-kevin-hart-in-critical-condition-after-gory-car-crash/ \"U.S. comedian Kevin Hart in critical condition after gory car crash.\"    NYDailyNews-TV.com website   in a headline Monday, September 18, 2017 2017-09-18    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02894"}
