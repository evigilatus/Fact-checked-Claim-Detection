With a smile on her face.\"\nThis video was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

And everyone should take note of that, on both levels, that they\u2019re not going to let up, and they should not, and we should not.\"\u00a0\nThat\u2019s all the YouTube clip shows, but a longer version of the exchange posted by the \"Late Show\" shows Harris saying that the protests continuing is \"critically important\" to achieve change. Neither she nor Colbert mention riots.\nDuring her rebuttal to Donald Trump\u2019s speech accepting the Republican nomination for president on Aug. 27, Harris condemned looting and violence but she said she supported peaceful protesters.\u00a0\n\"We should not confuse them with those looting and committing acts of violence, including the shooter who was arrested for murder,\" she said. \"And make no mistake, we will not let these vigilantes and extremists and derail the path to justice.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nWe rate this video False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18879"}
