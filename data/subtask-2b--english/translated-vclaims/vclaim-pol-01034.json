The article on Facebook in January 30 reads \"Trap signs for cleaning millions of tons of garbage from the world's oceans.\" The story was highlighted as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The link to the article leads to the story of October 12 in Neon Netle, an online publication \"Debates the official narrative of the public news cycle,\" according to its website. The story says that Trump signed our Sea Rescue Act 2018 and \"expanded and expanded the program to clean up man-made waste by promoting international cooperation in the removal of debris from the planet's oceans.\" Another story is cited on the Fox News website in El Paso. ......................................................................................................................... A spokesperson for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) did not respond to the e-mail of Poletti Fact on Facebook, but we received a response from a spokesperson for ocean conservation, a non-profit organization that supported and celebrated the passage of the law on the rescue of our seas. There are millions of tons of debris in the world &apos; s oceans; it is estimated that 8 million metric tons of plastic find their way there each year, according to the ocean portfolio. Is it accurate, as we have asked, to summarize legislation as a bill \"to clean up millions of tons of garbage from the world's oceans.\" Facebook was published on January 11, 2021 in Facebook, Nancy Belusi, who was no longer the Speaker of the House of Representatives by Samantha Buterman on January 12, 2021, \"not exactly,\" as Jordana Miran, director of communications in the group said. Indeed, the law signed by Tramp re-states the \"$10 million per year\" of the NOAA Marine Debris Programme, as she said. Among other efforts, the programme supports international coastal ocean conservation clean-up, in which volunteers collect millions of pounds of garbage off beaches and watercourses around the world. However, many entities provide financial support to the International Criminal Court.\" According to a copy of Tramp's remarks when he signed the bill on October 11, he said that more than 8 million tons of waste were dumped in the oceans each year. He said that the law to save our sailor \"will help address this problem.\" \"We also strengthen this to improve waste management abroad and clean the water of our nation.\" This legislation, sponsored by the United States of America and co-sponsored by Mr. Sheldon Whitehouse, De-Rod Island, was supported by both parties. It does not direct the country to clean up millions of tons of garbage from marine environments. Instead, the bill re-authorizes the amendment of the Marine Debris Act \"to promote international action to reduce marine debris, and for other purposes,\" in accordance with the Act. But it's not specific about the amount of debris, or how it should be cleaned up. For example, in cases of \"high marine debris event\" - when natural disasters such as tsunamis or storms cause unusually large amounts of marine debris - the United States \"helps to clean up and respond to the heavy marine debris incident,\" says the Bill. It also notes that the President should \"support research and development on systems and materials that reduce\" the amount of solid waste in the marine environment, as well as work with other countries that release waste into water to develop \"mechanisms to reduce such discharges.\" There are other proposals in law, such as the study of the economic effects of marine debris. Meanwhile, the Marine Debris Programme was established in 2006 to identify, assess, prevent, reduce and eliminate the sources of marine debris and to address the adverse effects of marine debris on the United States economy. But it also does not specify how many tons of debris the country will clean, as the Facebook article puts it. There are millions of tons of garbage in the world &apos; s oceans and President Donald Trump has signed a bill to re-authorize a programme aimed in part at the removal of marine debris. However, the law does not provide for the removal of a certain amount of garbage from water. We're assessing this claim half right.
