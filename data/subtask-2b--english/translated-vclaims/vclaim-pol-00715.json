Wade's case.", "text": "In an episode of political discourse, a broadcast was broadcast by St. Louis Public Radio, Ovalon Reap. Nick Shrour spoke of the legislation he is sponsoring, known as \"Missori, which supports the law of the unborn.\" The draft law, which prohibits abortion once foetal heartbeat or brain activity is discovered, is one of the country's most powerful pro-life bills. The interviewer (Jason Rosenbaum) (Shrewer) asked how he responded to the opponents of his bill who said that this would motivate women to exceed the six to eight weeks of pregnancy when heartbeat or brain activity could be detected to obtain a serious abortion. According to Schroeer, statistics measuring the number of women who died as a result of illegal abortions prior to the national legalization of abortion in Roe v. Wade in 1973 were fabricated and overestimated. Schroer said, \"There are statistics showing the number of women who died of illegal abortion prior to Roe v. Wade, which has increased dramatically since the death of women due to legal abortion. \"After further investigation, we found Schroer's allegation misleading. What makes a woman come to Schroeder to find out where he got the information on how many women are dying of legal abortion. In his reply, Schroeer said, \"This quote was intended to withdraw the numbers of female children as well.\" Since Roe v. Wade, the number of children killed, male and female, has risen dramatically according to this information. Whether it be, whether it be, whether it be, whether it be a baby, or how many lives have been lost as a result of abortion since Roo's rise significantly.\" None of that is clear from an evil answer to the graph, and it has nothing to do with the question he asked -- which was about pregnant women. So what do we know about the results of pregnant women seeking an abortion before Roe v. Wade? Have the deaths of pregnant women seeking abortion increased or decreased? On August 18, 2017, in a tweet, \"It is time to remove any statue of Margaret Sanger, who was a white superior, that took place in the Kikke events and was supported by Democrats. On October 5, 2017, Carissa Hagberg, an assistant professor in history at Tulan University, said, \"It may be difficult to obtain accurate deaths due to illegal abortion because many doctors and pathologists have withheld the cause of death from death certificates to protect caregivers and women's families.\" Many of these deaths are reported to be abortion or other complications in pregnancy. The Guttmacher Institute determines the number of deaths resulting from abortion prior to Roe v. Wade, where abortion was the official cause of death of some 2,700 women in 1930, 1,700 in 1940 and more than 300 in 1950. The Institute also states that the actual number was probably much higher. In her book \"When Abortion Was a Crime,\" Leslie G. Reagan said, \"The same developments that finally reduced the birth-related mortality rate have reduced the abortion mortality rate.\" Medical developments such as the use of blood transfusions and antibiotics make every medical procedure, including abortion, safer. Antibiotics were widely introduced in the post-Roe v. Wade case, and the number of deaths due to abortion continued to decline. The 1992 abortion control report of the Centre for Disease Control summarized the number of deaths resulting from legal and illegal abortion from 1972, one year before Roe v. Wade, to 1990. During this period of time, the number of deaths due to both legal and illegal abortions decreased. In 1972, the mortality rate was 4.1 per cent; by 1976, it had fallen to 1.1 per cent. According to the Centre for Disease Control, \"in 2014, the last year for which data are available, six women have been identified as having died as a result of complications resulting from legally induced abortion.\" Our judgment (Shrueer) said that the number of women dying of legal abortion \"has increased\" compared to illegal abortion before Roe v. Wade. Schroeder said that he was talking about pregnant women and female foetuses, although that was not the question he had asked and he was very misleading to the listeners. The number of women who died of abortion has steadily decreased, even before the decision in Roe v. Wade. We're assessing this claim with pants on fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00715"}
