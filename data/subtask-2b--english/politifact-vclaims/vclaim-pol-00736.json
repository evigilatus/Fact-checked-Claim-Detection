Today, an estimated 400,000 Israelis live in settlements in the West Bank, plus 200,000 in east Jerusalem.\nWilliamson said:\n\"It has been a long time since the United States could actually be considered by either side as an honest broker. With me as president, they will know that they have in the United States a president who listens deeply. \u2026 It's been since Jimmy Carter that we've had a U.S. president to say flat out those settlements are illegal. In me, you would have a president who says those settlements are illegal.\"\nThe discussion of Israeli settlements was timely, because shortly before winning re-election as Israel\u2019s prime minister about a week earlier, Benjamin Netanyahu broke with precedent by saying he would annex the West Bank. Critics said that would endanger a future deal that could include a Palestinian state.\nThe Trump administration hasn\u2019t officially weighed in on the annexation idea, but the administration previously made several moves that align with Netanyahu\u2019s wishes even though they had been rejected by previous U.S. presidents of both parties. The moves include relocating the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem and announcing that the Golan Heights \u2014 a different territory captured by Israel in the 1967 war \u2014 \"are part of the State of Israel.\"\nGiven the shifts in policy under the Trump administration, we wondered whether Williamson was correct to say that Carter was the last \"U.S. president to say flat out those \u00a0settlements are illegal.\" (Williamson\u2019s campaign did not respond to an inquiry.)\nWe found nuances in the often-murky diplomatic language. And Carter didn\u2019t literally use the word \"illegal\" while he was president.\nJimmy Carter\nAt a June 1980 question-and-answer session with the American Jewish Press Association, Carter was asked whether he considered the settlements \"illegal.\" He stopped just short of using that word.\n\"We consider these settlements to be contrary to the Geneva Convention, that occupied territories should not be changed by the establishment of permanent settlements by the occupying power,\" he said, adding, \"We have long maintained this position under the administration of previous presidents, back at least 15 years, that the establishment of settlements in that area was contrary to progress toward a comprehensive peace.\"\nLara Friedman, the president of the Foundation for Middle East Peace, which supports a two-state solution, told PolitiFact that, \"in effect, Carter was agreeing with the assertion that he views settlements as illegal \u2014\u00a0in that they were contrary to the Geneva Convention, meaning illegal \u2014\u00a0without using that word himself.\"\nAt least one of Carter\u2019s subordinates went so far as to use the word \"illegal\" \u2014\u00a0the United States representative to the United Nations, William Scranton, in a 1976 speech. \"Substantial resettlement of the Israeli civilian population in occupied territories, including in East Jerusalem, is illegal under the (Geneva) Convention,\" Scanton said.\nFriedman added that a group of memos to Carter from his chief of staff Hamilton Jordan used the term \"illegal\" in relation to Israeli settlements 16 times.\nAs for Carter himself, it took him until his post-presidential years to actually use the word \"illegal\" himself. During a 1983 press conference during a trip to the Middle East, Carter said, ''Settlements are illegal and an obstacle to peace.\"\nRonald Reagan\nIn a 1982 address to the nation, Reagan called for a freeze in settlements as part of peace negotiations, but he didn\u2019t call them \"illegal.\"\n\"The immediate adoption of a settlement freeze by Israel, more than any other action, could create the confidence needed for wider participation in these talks,\" Reagan said. \"Further settlement activity is in no way necessary for the security of Israel and only diminishes the confidence of the Arabs and a final outcome can be freely and fairly negotiated.\"\nIn a speech the following year, Reagan used a turn of phrase short of \"illegal\" that would recur in future years \u2014\u00a0that settlements are an \"obstacle to peace.\"\nGeorge H.W. Bush\nIn 1990, Bush reaffirmed the United States\u2019 stance, again without saying \"illegal.\"\n\"The United States policy on settlement in the occupied territories is unchanged and is clear, and that is, we oppose new settlements in territories beyond the 1967 lines. It is a stated, reaffirmed policy over and over again,\" Bush said during a news conference with Russia\u2019s Mikhail Gorbachev.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the rest of his term, Bush didn\u2019t use the term \"illegal,\" but U.S. policy turned against settlements in ways that irritated Israel. Bush insisted on settlement-related conditions for loan guarantees for Israel, and his secretary of state, James Baker, offered the \"sharpest criticism of Israel on settlements in history,\" Friedman said.\nThe Bush White House \"considered settlements a serious enough obstacle to push back quite significantly,\" said Samer S. Shehata, an associate professor in Middle East studies at the University of Oklahoma.\nBill Clinton\nIn 1996, Clinton continued to use the phrase \"obstacle to peace,\" and in 2001, he said that settlements were \"inconsistent\" with the commitment in the Oslo peace negotiations that \"both sides negotiate a compromise.\"\nAnd the Clinton-commissioned Mitchell Report \u2014 a \"fact-finding\" panel headed by former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell \u2014 called on Israel to \"freeze all settlement activity, including the 'natural growth' of existing settlements.\"\nKhaled Elgindy, a fellow in the Brookings Institution\u2019s Center for Middle East Policy, said dropping the \"obstacle to peace\" language amounted to a softening of U.S. rhetoric. The Clinton administration \"carved out various exemptions that allow Israel to continue building in some settlements,\" Elgindy said. Subsequent administrations also allowed settlement expansions of various types on an ad-hoc basis, he said.\nGeorge W. Bush\nThe George W. Bush administration put forward a \"roadmap\" for peace, which included a settlement freeze and a removal of settlement outposts erected since 2001. We found no examples of Bush using the word \"illegal\" or \"obstacle to peace.\"\nBarack Obama\nIn a June 2009 speech in Cairo, Obama heightened the rhetoric on the illegitimacy of Israeli settlements, but without using the word \"illegal.\"\n\"Israelis must acknowledge that just as Israel\u2019s right to exist cannot be denied, neither can Palestine\u2019s,\" Obama said. \"The United States does not accept the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlements. This construction violates previous agreements and undermines efforts to achieve peace. It is time for these settlements to stop.\"\nThen, in 2013, Secretary of State John Kerry echoed that language after a meeting with Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president. \"The position of the United States is that we consider now, and have always considered, the settlements to be illegitimate,\" Kerry said.\nDonald Trump\nTrump expressed some caution on settlements early in his presidency, telling the newspaper Israel Hayom in February 2017 that settlements \"don\u2019t help the process.\" He added, \"Every time you take land for settlements, there is less land left. But we are looking at that, and we are looking at some other options, we\u2019ll see. But no, I am not somebody that believes that going forward with these settlements is a good thing for peace.\"\nThat same month, in a press conference with Netanyahu, Trump said, \"As far as settlements, I\u2019d like to see you hold back on settlements for a little bit.\"\nIn September 2017, U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman said in a television interview, \"I think the settlements are part of Israel,\" though the State Department later walked back the idea that this was a shift in policy.\nMore recently, Trump\u2019s moves on the U.S. Embassy and the Golan Heights have fueled speculation that he might go further in accepting Israeli settlements, and pro-settlement groups are lobbying the administration to take the leap.\nIn an Israeli television interview in April 2019, Netanyahu was asked why he wasn\u2019t yet pushing Trump to change U.S. policy. \"Wait until the next term,\" he replied.\nTracing the rhetorical arc\nSo Carter never used the term \"illegal.\" But broadly speaking, U.S. statements about the settlements\u2019 legality have gone from tough under Carter to somewhat less tough, though in a bit of a zigzagging way.\n\"There has definitely been a softening, and it has never reverted back\" to what it was under Carter, said David Makovsky, director of the Project on Arab-Israel Relations at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.\nElgindy of Brookings also said it\u2019s reasonable to separate Carter\u2019s rhetoric. \"He does stand out substantively from his successors,\" he said.\nFriedman,\u00a0Foundation for Middle East Peace,\u00a0added that it\u2019s important to distinguish between rhetoric and policies.\n\"While the wording under Carter may have been tougher about the legal status of settlements, it was subsequent presidents who tried to put some actual meat on the bones of U.S. anti-settlement policy,\" she said. \"It was Reagan who first called for a settlement freeze. It was George H.W. Bush who imposed conditions on loan guarantees tied to Israel's settlements policy. It was under Clinton, George W. Bush, and Obama that the U.S. again called for a settlement freeze.\"\nIt\u2019s also important not to get overly focused on the question of legality, Makovsky said.\u00a0The settlements could still be considered a political \"irritant without being illegal,\" he said.\nOur ruling\nWilliamson said that Jimmy Carter was the last \"U.S. president to say flat out those (Israeli) settlements are illegal.\"\nWe couldn\u2019t find an example of Carter actually using the word \"illegal\" to refer to Israeli settlements while he was president. However, he did as an ex-president, and experts agreed that his rhetoric came closer than the words used by his successors in the Oval Office.\nAt the same time, it\u2019s important to note that subsequent presidents\u2019 actual policies may have had more teeth than Carter\u2019s, despite his tougher rhetoric.\nWe rate the statement Half True.\n Share the Facts 2019-04-22 14:04:23 UTC   PolitiFact    4 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Half True  Says Jimmy Carter was the last \"U.S. president to say flat out those (Israeli) settlements are illegal.\"    Marianne Williamson Democratic presidential candidate http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1904/14/se.01.html   in a CNN town hall Sunday, April 14, 2019 2019-04-14    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00736"}
