That's not true.", "text": "President Donald Trump is facing a reaction from Democrats and some members of his political party after he said that he would withdraw United States troops from Syria, despite the ongoing battle in the region against terrorism. The decision is \"a premature and costly mistake that threatens not only the safety and security of the United States, but also encourages ISIS, Bashar Assad, Iran and Russia,\" and he wrote a letter to Tramp signed by six members of the United States Senate, including four Republicans. On Twitter, Trump claimed that his movement was not in favor of Russia. After Trump quoted comments from television recruits and members of the Republican Senate who praised his plan, Trump wrote in December 20: \"It was no surprise to leave Syria. Years ago, six months ago, when I wanted to do it publicly, I agreed to stay longer. Russia, Iran, Syria and others are the local enemy of ISIS. We were doing a job there. It's time to go home and rebuild. Does the United States of America want to be a Middle East cop, getting nothing, but spending precious lives and trillions of dollars protecting others who, in almost every case, don't appreciate what we're doing? Do we want to be there forever? It's time for others to finally fight... \"Russians, Iran, Syria and many others are not happy to leave the United States, despite what the false news says, because now they're gonna fight ISIS and the others, who hate them, without us. I'm building so far the most powerful army in the world. ISIL beats us dead!\" We questioned Trump's claim that several States, particularly Russia, were \"unhappy about the United States. They're \"leaving.\" The comments of Russian President Vladimir Putin and others contradict Tramp's assertion. The White House did not respond to Poletti Fact &apos; s requests for evidence in support of Trump &apos; s claim. A civil war began in Syria in 2011, after uprisings against President Bashar al-Assad. The conflict has escalated and become more complex, with various groups involved within the country and foreign countries - not to mention terrorist groups. In the complex struggle for power, Russia and Iran support the Syrian Government. The United States supports opposition groups. The United States has long accused the Syrian Government of committing atrocities against its people, including a chemical-weapons attack in April 2017, which killed more than 80 people. The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria who support Syrian Kurds fighting the Islamic State terrorist group. By tweeting that ISIS had been defeated in Syria, Trump claimed that there was no longer a need for United States forces to be there. Members of the Senate who objected to the Trump resolution did not agree with his assessment of ISIL. Among the signatories are Lindsay Graham from South Carolina and Tom Cotton from Arkansas, who supported him in other policy objectives. \"while you believe that the ISIS threat has been dispelled, the Earth's conditions paint a very different picture,\" said the message. On January 13, 2021, bloggers mentioned the remarkable facts in a story in which General David H. Berger, commander of the US Navy, said that they rejected Nancy Belusi's request for the use of marines for inaugural security, saying, \"We are not working for you.\" On January 17, 2021, senators added that the US' departure from Syria might encourage Assad \"to take further action to strengthen his power,\" and that Iran and Russia used the Syrian conflict \"to increase their influence in the region.\" Russia welcomed the United States military withdrawal, so is Putin unhappy about this? On the contrary. At an annual press conference on 20 December, Putin stated that he agreed with Tramp &apos; s claim that ISIS had been defeated. Putin said that he did not believe that the presence of American troops was required in Syria. The United States presence there had been illegal because it had not been approved by the United Nations Security Council, and because the Syrian Government had not invited the United States to her country. Putin said: \"Russian forces have been invited by the Syrian Government,\" according to the copy published on the Kremlin website. \"The United States has not received any of these even if they decide to withdraw their troops, is the right decision.\" On 19 December, Maria Zakharova, spokesman for the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, welcomed the decision of Trump to withdraw United States forces from Syria. \"The story of a teacher who may develop from this decision is a real possibility for a political solution,\" Russian news agency TASS stated that Zacharova is telling another Russian news channel. \"The hope is that this site on the Syrian map will follow the example of Aleppo and other Syrian towns and villages that begin to return to peaceful life,\" Zakharova quotes. \"When Americans were there, there was no such hope.\" The Center for Strategic and International Studies, which focuses on international policy issues, said in article Q &A about the Trump decision that the United States is working with Syrians and foreign groups throughout the conflict in Syria to negotiate the country &apos; s political future. The Group stated that the parallel processes led by Russia in recent years went beyond the discussions sponsored by the United States. \"With the rapid withdrawal of the United States from Syria, the position of the United States in any negotiations on Syria's future has become very weak,\" wrote analysts John B. Alterman and Will Tudman with the Middle East program at the Center. \"Maybe the most confusing, United States opponents have sacrificed nothing to get that result.\" The Special Presidential Envoy of the Global Alliance for the Defeat of ISIL, Brett McGork, told journalists on 11 December, prior to the Trump Declaration, that he believed it was \"just to say that Americans will remain on the ground after the material defeat of succession, until we get the pieces necessary to ensure that such defeat continues.\" Brian Finlay, President and Executive Director of the Stemson Center, a non-partisan public policy research centre, told Politi Fact that \"the overwhelming majority of foreign policy thinkers\" seemed to agree with McGurk. \"while it is clear that the President's critics are absolutely right to say that those conditions were far from being met, it is also difficult to imagine a scenario where these pieces will be held at any time in their place,\" Finlay said. The withdrawal of the United States from Syria will leave \"a great void in the region,\" as Finlay said, which Russia, Syria and Iran will seek to exploit. As Associated Press reported in December 20, Syrian Member of Parliament Peter Morgana described the withdrawal of the United States from Syria as \"acknowledged that Syria has won.\" Many analysts said that while Iran had not formally responded to the Trump decision, it would benefit in its quest to strengthen its role in the region. Our Governor Trump said, \"Russian, Iran, Syria and many others are not happy\" about American troops leaving Syria. Putin publicly welcomed this step, considering it the right decision. The United States forces in Syria support forces that oppose the Syrian Government, and Iran supports the Syrian Government. Six American senators and analysts have said that Russia, Iran and Syria are ready to stimulate their authority in the region without the United States. Trump's assessment is inaccurate. We appreciate Trump's claim that it was wrong.
