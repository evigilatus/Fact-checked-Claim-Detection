Its economic effects \"catastrophic.\"\n\nWould it?\n\nState Rep. Matt Ramsey, a Republican from Peachtree City, is lead sponsor of the wide-ranging legislation. It would allow legal residents to sue if they think an agency is not adequately enforcing state immigration law; ban transporting, harboring or enticing an illegal immigrant to enter the state; authorize an officer to check a suspect\u2019s legal status if there is \"reasonable suspicion\" that he is here illegally; and require businesses with more than five employees to use the federal E-Verify system to ensure their workers are legal residents.\n\nSome portions resemble Arizona\u2019s HB 1070, which critics say encourages racial profiling and infringes on federal authority. The U.S. Department of Justice and civil rights groups are suing Arizona over the 2010 legislation, and major cities and organizations boycotted the state. \u00a0\n\nWe asked Brett Bittner, executive director of the Libertarian Party of Georgia, for evidence to back his claim about Georgia\u2019s legislation. He did not have specific costs but said Ramsey\u2019s bill \"grows the size of government.\"\n\nLawsuits challenging its constitutionality could be costly, Bittner said. Plus, the provision that would allow individuals to sue agencies over enforcement could spawn frivolous suits.\n\n\"We\u2019re not sure of the costs, and Representative Ramsey hasn\u2019t provided any of the costs,\" Bittner said.\n\nIndeed, Ramsey didn\u2019t have an estimate. So PolitiFact Georgia dug up cost estimates for Arizona and states considering similar legislation and looked at an existing program for guidance. \u00a0\n\nWe found that estimates are extremely limited. Arizona\u2019s costs for certain HB 1070 provisions are unknown because a federal judge temporarily blocked their implementation.\n\nWe also found that the impact is so complex that it is difficult to predict.\n\nFor instance, if illegal immigrants and their families leave Georgia because of the legislation, state government would no longer have to subsidize their children\u2019s health care or education, advocates for lower immigration levels noted. \u00a0\n\nBut illegal immigrants would no longer buy goods or services or work here, which could lower tax revenue and weaken the economy, critics of the legislation told PolitiFact.\n\nMost research, though limited, concludes tax revenue generated by all immigrants exceeds the cost of the services they use, the Congressional Budget Office said in 2007.\n\nHB 87 could save money. Gwinnett County is part of the federal 287(g) program, which allows state or local law enforcement agencies to enforce certain immigration laws. Its sheriff said this program lowered its foreign-born jail population in its first year, saving between $386,010 and $2.1 million. Program staffing cost $1.2 million.\n\nA January study on 287(g) said those local costs shift to the federal government. \u00a0\n\nIf one cost is almost certain, it\u2019s legal bills.\n\nArizona\u2019s total is $1.5 million as of early this month, and its governor is using donations to pay them. The American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia plans to sue if HB 87 passes as written.\n\nAnother potential cost is from lost convention business from boycotts. Roughly three months after HB 1070\u2019s passage, Arizona\u2019s Hotel and Lodging Association said at least 40 group meetings were canceled, costing $12 million in revenue, excluding restaurant, retailer or rental car company losses. The progressive Center for American Progress estimated a total loss of about $141 million. This translates to $9.4 million in lost tax revenue. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nEstimates by other states for their own Arizona-style legislation also hint at potential Georgia costs.\n\nThe Kentucky Legislature is considering a bill that could cost $40 million a year despite savings on services for illegal immigrants who leave. A Utah bill could cost local governments between $5.3 million and $11.3 million yearly.\n\nRamsey argued that those bills are so different their estimates may not apply to HB 87. Indeed, Kentucky\u2019s bill, unlike HB 87, makes crossing state lines as an illegal immigrant a crime. Arrests, and therefore costs, could be higher.\n\nStill, Georgia\u2019s bill contains provisions that on their face appear pricey. The provision that would allow local law enforcement agencies to check immigration status would likely cost money to transport illegal immigrants to federal facilities and train officers.\n\nThe bill would let residents sue state and local agencies for inadequate enforcement, which could result in big legal bills. Ramsey said he is revising the bill to address this.\n\nTo sum up:\n\nWhile there\u2019s no evidence to show the legislation would have \"huge\" and \"catastrophic\" effects, there is enough to be concerned that HB 87 could have significant costs. Whether the bill would save money down the road is unclear.\n\nRegardless, Georgia\u2019s budget is about $18 billion. And while the potential costs could strain the state\u2019s already tight budget, it\u2019s extremely unlikely they would bankrupt the state.\n\nGeorgia Libertarians\u2019 alarmist statement that the bill \"will bankrupt Georgia\" is therefore False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13598"}
