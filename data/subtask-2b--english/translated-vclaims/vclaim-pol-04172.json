In its reply, Hillary Clinton defended the law, citing its provisions aimed at ending barriers to obtaining insurance for those with pre-existing circumstances and the time limits for coverage. \"If we cancel it, as Donald suggested, and start over, all the benefits I just mentioned have been lost to everyone -- not just people who get their health insurance on exchange,\" she said. \"And then we have to start over\" The practical results of the law had been strong. \"Now we're in 90 percent health insurance coverage,\" she said. \"This is the highest we've ever been in our country.\" Is she right? Yeah. The most common data come from the United States Census Bureau, which annually updates statistics on the percentage of Americans covered by health insurance. The last report was issued in September 2016 and covers 2015. The Census Bureau found that 90.9 per cent of Americans had some kind of health coverage, whether it was provided by their employer, was purchased independently or through a government programme such as medical care or medical assistance. The rest - 9.1 per cent of Americans - were not insured. Here is the main table of the report: the distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"Trap refers to the rebel law - General Flynn for appointment as Vice-President.\" By Samantha Buterman: January 11, 2021, this was an improvement from 89.6 per cent in 2014, 86.7 per cent in 2013, 84.6 per cent in 2012, 84.3 per cent in 2011, and 83.7 per cent in 2010 -- in the year in which the Affordable Care Act was passed, although the Act did not start to have a significant impact for a few more years. At the same time, between 1999 and 2009, the insurance rate jumped from a low of 83.9 per cent to a high of 86.9 per cent, far from the Census Bureau providing statistics on the Internet. At the time of the release of the 2015 data, the framework was developed as a high insurance coverage index. In contrast, the uninsured rate fell from 16.3 per cent in 2010 to 9.1 per cent in 2015 - a decline of almost half over five years. Our rule said Clinton, \"Now we're in 90 percent health insurance coverage. This is the highest we've ever been in our country.\" According to census office data, this is true; it was a mere shame of 91 per cent in 2015, the last year for which data are available. We're evaluating the statement right. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/491fb1b8-ab7c-4372-bd27-f484b5729ea7", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04172"}
