Texas, says that the United States cannot defeat an enemy he will not define. The presidential candidate came to Richmond on 14 November to address a dinner ceremony organized by the Family Foundation, a socially conservative lobby group. Before the speech, Cruz was asked at a press conference how the United States should respond to the terrorist attacks a day ago in Paris. \"Well, the first thing we have to do is identify the evil we're fighting,\" said Cruz. \"The fact that President Obama will not recognize him, he will not say literally the term \"extremist Islamic terrorism,\" and at the political level, no one in the administration will say the term \"extremist Islamic terrorism.\" We wondered whether the White House really avoids it. We texted Cruz's campaign twice, but we didn't answer it. Also, the White House press office did not respond to e-mail questions for this article. We have therefore tried Lexie Nyxy's research on media articles and speaking records using the words \"Brack Obama\" and \"extremist Islamic terrorism.\" We've brought 1900 items - more than we've had time to look. However, we have found on the list many references to complaints from current and former presidential competitors - Louisiana Goff. Bobby Gindal, Wisconsin Goff. Scott Walker and Cruz - Obama does not use the phrase. We have also looked for the term \"extremist Islamic terrorism\" through the search engine on the White House website, and we have not been able to find an example of administrative officials describing the Islamic State in this way. In one case, during a news briefing in February, the closest thing was when White House Press Secretary Josh Ernest referred to \"Islamic militants\" during the discussion of Islamic State fighters in Iraq. In February, the Politifakt National, the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times reported that the President and his administration were trying to avoid invoking Islam while describing the Islamic State and its followers, preferring to describe the organization's philosophy in non-religious terms such as \"violent extremism.\" Obama also described the Islamic State as a \"terrorist group\" with \"moderate ideology.\" The result, according to these articles, is that the White House wants to avoid linking 1.6 billion Muslims in the world to terrorism. That can play in the hands of terrorists, who portray the United States as an enemy of Islam itself. Obama refers to ISIS as another abbreviation, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. \"ISIL is not \"Islamic,\" he said in the statement of September 10, 2014, \"No religion condones the killing of innocent people.\" Check the facts (Kirk Cox) was mentioned on January 13, 2021 in a speech. Virginia ranked lowest third of the states in the management of the COVID-19 vaccine. On 20 January 2021 at a press conference on 16 November in Turkey, Obama said that the group did not represent Islam and \"is not in any way represented by the attitudes of the overwhelming majority of Muslims.\" However, Obama added that Muslims around the world \"have to ask very serious questions about how to entrench these extremist ideologies, even if they affect a very small part of the population.\" Two analysts in the Middle East told us that the careful white house formulation is not a coincidence. Rick Brennan, a major political scientist in Rand, said that the administration avoided linking the words \"extremist Islam\" and \"terrorism\" because it did not want to give religious legitimacy to the Islamic State in the Islamic world and to swell the ranks of the Organization. David Gartenstein-Ross, a senior colleague of the Foundation for the Defence of Democracies, had a similar share. There is a discussion among analysts about governance terms. Brennan PolititFact National reported earlier this year that the White House formulation was \"very cautious,\" noting that the teachings of the Islamic State reflected a race of Islam that attracted 40,000 or more followers. James Gilvin, Professor of History at the University of California, disagrees. He told Bolivi Fukte that it was not necessary to emphasize a religious aspect of the Islamic State because \"their faith is totally unpopular among most people who consider themselves to be Muslims.\" Our government said that the Obama administration would not use the term \"extremist Islamic terrorism.\" And even though we wouldn't have sworn that White House officials never said those words in public, we didn't find any evidence to the contrary. It is clear that the administration prefers non-religious methods to describe the Islamic State - such as \"terrorist group,\" \"violent extremism\" and \"controversial ideology.\" We also appreciate the rise of Cruz by health. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6a836aeb-405a-49f2-9a3f-32ac9aff818", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05671"}
