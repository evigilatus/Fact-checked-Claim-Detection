Joe Manchin\u2019s West Virginia.\n\nDueling ads from the NRA and Manchin target West Virginia voters: \"Tell Senator Manchin to honor his commitment to the Second Amendment!\" and \"Call the NRA and tell them to support criminal background checks!\"\n\nManchin\u2019s not giving up his quest to broaden gun buyer background checks, the Associated Press reported June 26, 2013.\n\nThe Democratic senator told Chris Matthews on MSNBC that he\u2019s still making his case to the people in West Virginia to resurrect the bill that died in April.\n\n\"When they start seeing what we have done to the bill, you know what they said? And you mean the NRA in Washington is against this? We have been fighting for some of these provisions for the last decade or more.\n\n\"And I said, all we have done \u2014 and I said, guess what? In 1999, the NRA leadership in Washington, pretty much the same people intact, were for this. I haven't changed.

No loopholes for anyone.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the House rejected an expansion of background checks in June 1999 \u2014 a rejection the NRA supported. A Washington Post headline at the time said, \"NRA Achieves Its Goal: Nothing.\"\n\nLaPierre\u2019s testimony before the House subcommittee hadn\u2019t been in support of background checks legislation \u2014 it was against an amendment from Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J..\n\nIn his testimony, he outlined a set of proposals the NRA at the time found \"reasonable,\" such as \"instant criminal background checks.\"\n\nBut the crux of his testimony was that he found provisions of the legislation unreasonable, such as the way the legislation defined a gun show, how the law handled inheritance of weapons, and that the instant check system didn\u2019t destroy records of transactions immediately.\n\nThe NRA ultimately backed legislation in the House that did expand background checks to sales at gun shows \u2014 but cut the time allowed for background checks to 24 hours, a change that ultimately killed the legislation.\n\nManchin\u2019s recent legislation, which he offered with Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, addressed a number of the NRA\u2019s concerns with Lautenberg\u2019s 1999 provisions. (We summarized Manchin-Toomey back in April.) \u00a0It didn\u2019t apply background checks to transfers between close relatives. Its definition of a gun show increased the number of guns from 50 to 75 and excluded residences of private collectors. It ultimately would have cut the time allowed for background checks down to 24 hours. But the NRA still challenged applying background checks to transfers between distant relatives and \"lifelong friends,\" for example, echoing its opposition to 1999 proposals.\n\nOur ruling\n\nManchin explained his continued pursuit of expanding background checks, saying that in 1999, even \"the NRA leadership in Washington, pretty much the same people intact, were for this.\"\n\nHe\u2019s correct that LaPierre, at the center of the most recent gun legislation battle, testified before lawmakers that the NRA supported \"mandatory instant criminal background checks for every sale.\"\n\nBut then, as now, the group was opposed to specific legislative measures behind implementation of expanded checks. Even Manchin\u2019s compromise measure may not have passed muster with 1999\u2019s NRA. He\u2019s right that the leadership expressed support for expanding background checks generally, but the details get more complicated, especially in the context of specific legislation.
