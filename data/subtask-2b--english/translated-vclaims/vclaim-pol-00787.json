Kennedy Jr. didn't raise Donald Trump's presidency in George's magazine.", "text": "There were many conspiracy theories about the assassination of former President John F. Kennedy, but in 2010 a new wave of allegations began, such as that of President Donald Trump saying daily prayers to the old commander-in-chief. Other allegations focus on Kennedy &apos; s son, John F. Kennedy, Jr. He died in an aircraft crash in July 1999. However, according to the source, he either faked his death or was killed to get Hillary Clinton off the political track. According to the Facebook article of April 1, Trump once praised Trump as a huge presidential candidate. \"If my dear friend Donald Trump ever decided to sacrifice his wonderful billionaire way of life to become president... he would be an unstoppable force for final justice... celebrated by both Democrats and Republicans,\" read the text over the image of Trump and Kennedy posted on Facebook on 1 April. This quote is attributed to Kennedy and includes a reference to Georges magazine, June 1999. This article was referred to as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Perhaps because Kennedy never said that in the Georges case, or ever, as far as we know. Liam Nesson appeared on the cover that month, and the subject includes stories showing the actor, Ariana Havengton and the tobacco lawyer. Ann Colter wrote an article about the dating scene in Washington, D.C. But Trump did not mention it on the magazine's pages. Kennedy was president and editor-in-chief of George, and wrote the editor's letter from Star Wars to Sin at the time. John McCain wrote to the financial reform campaign. We wondered whether Kennedy had made a statement about Trump elsewhere, but we could not find it when we sought news coverage on the Internet. The nearest match in November 2016 was the New York Post story that Kennedy's former business partner, Michael Berman, referred to a moment in 1996 when Kennedy led a group of advertisers to Mar Lago. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" According to the story: \"As was often the case with Kennedy in his events, the talk quickly turned to whether he could imagine himself as a presidential candidate. In an attempt to get the letter of the presidential gossip, Kennedy observed that Trump was much cooler than the Kennedy family compound a few miles away. \"I think you should ask those questions from Donald,\" said Kennedy, according to Berman. \"It is clear that he has the most excessive winter White House.\" In June 1999, we also searched the Nexus database of American publications for any mention of John F. Kennedy Jr. and Donald Trump. There were two outcomes. First, the story of June 24, New York Post consists of smaller news materials, remembering both men but not about each other. The second story, a similar one on 9 June, New York Daily News, also refers to both, but not both. \"John Kennedy Jr. is scheduled to spend a few months in a cast after breaking his ankle in Martha Square,\" says the article. \"Friends say he's gonna get a little crazy.\" Kennedy and Trump. The judges weren't strangers. The picture that appears on Facebook is real, the one from March 1999, when the two men saw the New York Knicks game. While one of Kennedy's associates said that he once praised Mar Lago and asked questions about the presidential candidacy for Trump, Kennedy did not make the Twaani statement on Facebook as he claimed, nor did he say it in his magazine in June 1999. We're assessing this article as wrong. Sharing the facts 2019-04-08 19:55:46 UTC Politic Fact 2 1 7 PoliticFacting: falish John F.
