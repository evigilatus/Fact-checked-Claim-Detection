Conservative websites came down hard on Krugman for his error, taking it as a case study of mainstream media spreading fake news.\nThere\u2019s no question that Krugman was wrong. Here\u2019s how the episode played out.\nAt about noon on Sept. 30, Krugman tweeted, \"Cholera. In a US territory. Among US citizens. In the 21st century. Heckuva job, Trumpie.\"\nCholera is spread by bacteria in dirty water and can bring on severe diarrhea, so severe, it can even be\u00a0fatal.\nWithin minutes, people peppered Krugman with tweets asking for his source and noting that that were no confirmed cases of cholera. A University of New Hampshire journalism professor wrote, \"UPDATE (please share): Cholera outbreak in Puerto Rico is UNCONFIRMED at this time.\"\nAbout six hours after the initial tweet, Krugman retracted his claim.\n\"OK, cholera not confirmed,\" he wrote. \"Conjunctivitis yes; lack of clean water (situation worsening, not improving) makes it a risk. But not certain.\"\nOK, cholera not confirmed. Conjunctivitis yes; lack of clean water (situation worsening, not improving) makes it a risk. But not certain\u2014 Paul Krugman (@paulkrugman) September 30, 2017\n\nAbout half an hour before Krugman sent out his correction, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tweeted, \"CDC does not anticipate cholera cases in Puerto Rico or the U.S. Virgin Islands b/c of #Maria.\"\nCDC does not anticipate cholera cases in Puerto Rico or the U.S. Virgin Islands b/c of #Maria. #MariaPR https://t.co/dzSnsaj50u\u2014 CDC (@CDCgov) September 30, 2017\n\nKrugman\u2019s original tweet was shared over 14,000 times. The correction was retweeted 567 times (as of this writing).\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe were curious about where this rumor came from and asked Krugman.\nHe said he saw it in a tweet from Kurt Eichenwald and \"was far too quick to assume it was validated.\"\nKurt Eichenwald, a liberal commentator and contributing editor to Vanity Fair, tweeted on Sept. 29, \"Cases of cholera now being reported in Puerto Rico. I can\u2019t believe this is America. We're too incompetent or uncaring to get them water?\"\nThat tweet was retweeted more than 13,000 times. We found no retraction by Eichenwald on Twitter.\nWarnings for the potential for cholera had been bouncing around the web.\nA couple of days before Krugman\u2019s tweet, the liberal information and political action website Daily KOS included and then retracted reports of the disease. \u00a0The corrected headline for a Sept. 28 blog post said \"SOS Puerto Rico: The suffering continues; Update: Cholera cases possible (not confirmed).\" At the end of the post, was this note: \"An earlier version of this diary included a Tweet saying that cases of cholera had been reported. Given the facts of the ground \u2014 including, particularly, the lack of clean drinking water \u2014 this is definitely a possibility. \u00a0Importantly, though, I have been unable to find confirmation of the information in that Tweet. I should not have posted it as fact, and have updated the title.\"\nThe Daily Beast had an article that underscored the potential for an eruption of cholera. Under the headline \"Outbreaks begin in Puerto Rico while Trump tweets \u2018amazing job\u2019,\" was\u00a0the warning \"mayors and a top physician tell The Daily Beast the island faces deadly outbreaks of cholera and hepatitis unless the federal government surges help.\"\nThe earliest tweet we found that declared that people had cholera in Puerto Rico came on Sept. 27 from a man in Boston who wrote, without any supporting evidence, that \"Reports of cholera already breaking out.\"\nConservative websites took Krugman to task.\n\"NYT\u2019s Paul Krugman falsely blames \u2018Trumpie\u2019 for non-existent cholera outbreak in Puerto Rico,\" read the Daily Caller\u2019s headline. TownHall wrote \"No, Mr. Krugman, There is not a cholera outbreak in Puerto Rico.\" And the Blaze wrote \"NYT columnist slams Trump after cholera reported in Puerto Rico \u2014 except there\u2019s just one problem.\"\nOur ruling\nKrugman said that cases of cholera had been reported in Puerto Rico. By his own account, that was incorrect. He assumed someone he trusted had verified the facts and the person\u00a0hadn't.\u00a0\nHealth care professionals raised the concern that massive damage to the water supply system increased the risk of cholera, but that falls well short of an actual outbreak. While references to a cholera outbreak littered the twittersphere, those accounts were being rejected two days before Krugman\u2019s tweet.\nWe rate this claim False.
