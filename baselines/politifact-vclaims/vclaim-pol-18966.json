Keep that in mind when you see online posts of an alarming tweet from \"RBGOfficial\" preceding her death. There\u2019s nothing official about it.\nOne fake post shared the day after Ginsburg died evoked a well-worn conspiracy linking former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton to various deaths of former staffers and associates.\nThe Instagram post included a screenshot of a tweet from @RBGOfficial on 8 p.m. on Sept. 18 \u2014 the same evening she died. \"I have information that will lead to the arrest of Hillary Clinton,\" the tweet says.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe person who posted this added touches of flair to make the post look legitimate, adding a photo of Ginsburg as the avatar and a blue checkmark to indicate a verified Twitter account. But the claim is easily debunked. Whoever created @RBGOfficial in 2013 has zero followers and tweets.\nGinsburg died of complications from metastatic pancreatic cancer in her Washington home. She was 87.\nWe rate this post Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18966"}
