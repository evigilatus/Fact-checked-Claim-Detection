His article - which drew our attention because of his unauthorized use of the picture of Poletti Fuckett the Truth O-Meter - began to summarize the results of the news article: \"Income equality has increased to the highest level in 50 years.\" \"FACT: Quite the opposite,\" wrote Brady. \"In the new census report all four measures of income inequality, SHRONK reversed the rise over the past five decades.\" We had to ask: Who's right? Does the United States have the highest levels of income inequality in the past 50 years, or does the latest figure show a decrease in inequality? The news reports describe the growing inequality. Let us begin with the Associated Press article, which was published when new income information was released from the American Community Survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau at the end of September. \"The gap between those who own and those who do not in the United States last year widened to its highest level in more than 50 years of tracking income inequality,\" read the story, and attributed the information to the Census Bureau. The article goes on to discuss a change in the Gini Index - a common summary measure of income inequality. The value varies from 0 (full equality, when each individual receives an equal share) to 1 (full equality, when one group or beneficiary receives all income). In 2018, the United States Community Survey set the Gini Index at 0.485, a statistically significant increase over 2017, when the Gini Index was estimated at 0.482. Many news outlets have written articles on new data released by the Census Bureau, including the Washington Post. \"Inequality in income in the United States has reached its highest level since the Census Bureau began tracking it more than five decades ago, according to the data released on Thursday, even with the country's poverty and unemployment rates falling at historical levels,\" Post. National Public Radio stated that \"the gap between the richest and poorest families in the United States is now the largest in the past 50 years.\" In the press release issued by the Census Bureau, which announced the latest survey, the Agency stated that income inequality in 2018 was \"a lot higher\" than in 2017. So, how could Brady have come to a different conclusion about the income inequality situation in the United States after reviewing census office data? \"The most obvious thing that happens is that they talk about two different sources of data,\" said Rakesh Kochar, the senior researcher at the Pew Research Center who studies trends in income and wealth. Isabel Guzdez, speaking on behalf of Brady, stated that his allegation was based on the latest report on the current population survey issued by the Census Bureau in September. The current population survey is a joint effort of the Census Bureau and the United States Bureau of Labour Statistics to track employment, income and education statistics throughout the country. It is a different project from the American Community Survey, which has a much larger sample size and collects information on population, housing and other subjects - including income. Kochar said that the current population survey should be \"understandable as a national survey,\" while the American community survey \"is designed to measure across states, sub-regions and districts.\" \"The two surveys are different in methodology, sample size and reporting period, so it is not unusual for them to report slightly different results,\" said David Cooper, a senior economic analyst at the Institute of Economic Policy. One of the main differences between the surveys is that the current population survey raises more detailed questions about income than the United States Community Survey. In addition, the current population survey uses a smaller sample. In order to analyse national income estimates, the Census Bureau generally recommends that the current population survey be used on the American Community Survey, according to a statement by the Agency. On January 16, 2021, Jordan Rachel stated in Tweedda that the minimum wage of $15 per hour would raise the price of taco bill burrito to $38. By Bill McCarthy: 20 January 2021, while the current population survey can show changes in income inequality over longer periods of time, \"evenly rarely are changes from year to year in Jenny of statistical significance,\" due to the size of the small sample survey, according to the statement. The current population survey also uses the Gini Index, as well as three other summary measures of inequality - Thel, Atkinson and average logarithmic deviation - while the American Community Survey includes only Gini. \"Anyway, it is also difficult to explain, while Jenny has a clearer explanation,\" reads the statement from the Census Bureau. \"Gini coefficient is the most used measure of inequality.\" The value of Gini can vary according to the survey and other factors. When Brady referred to \"four measures of income inequality,\" Gooseds said he was looking at the values of Jenny, Thel, Atkinson and the medium logarithmic deviation from the current 2018 Population Survey on Income and Poverty. The current population survey report uses \"two different concepts of income\" to measure inequality: monetary income and income adjusted by equation. Monetary income is household income, while income adjusted on an equal basis takes into account the number of people in the household and how they can share resources. Given cash income only, all four summary measures appear to show a decrease in the disparity between 2017 and 2018. However, none of the reductions are considered to be of statistical importance. \"If you go to the CPS 2018, it's no different from the 2017 estimate, statistically speaking,\" said Kochar. \"I have decreased, but it was not enough to be statistically important. All you can say from CPS is that there was no change between 2017 and 2018.\" The Census Bureau analysed the changes in the Gini index in the current population survey report and said, from that data, \"We cannot say with confidence whether Jenny has increased slightly, decreased slightly, or has not changed relatively.\" With regard to income adjusted on the basis of parity, all four measures decreased from 2017 to 2018. Three of these measures, which do not include the average logarithmic deviation, have decreased significantly statistically. The Census Bureau and the economists we consulted to verify the facts stated that it is normal to see changes in these measurements, depending on the source of the data and the concept of income used in the estimation. Ken Ho Lin, Professor of Sociology at the University of Texas in Austin, said that both Associated Press and Brady should be more careful with their explanations of census office data. He said: \"In general, there is no significant change from year to year in inequality.\" \"Thus, it is difficult to separate the real trend from the statistical noise.\" Kochar agreed, and said that the consideration of further changes in income inequality did not tell the whole story. \"I would like to conclude that, at times when we are now, income inequality is higher than it was in five decades,\" said Kochar. \"Whether this year is different from last year, this is one of the five decades.\" A similar assessment was provided by Cooper of the Institute for Economic Policy. \"The Potom Line: AP Minute Story,\" said Cooper. None of the statistics invoked by Mr. Brady refutes anything reported on the story of E.B.\" Our ruling Brady said that Associated Press was wrong when it stated that \"income inequality has risen to the highest number in 50 years\" because in \"a new census report of all four measures of income inequality SHRONK, the rise has been reversed over the past five decades.\" Brady used a different census office scan from Associated Press to file his claim. The two surveys yielded slightly different results on income inequality - which, according to multiple experts, is normal. The Associated Press survey showed a statistically significant increase in income inequality from 2017 to 2018, using the only measure of inequality in the survey. In the Brady survey, estimates were made for four measures of income inequality using two different categories of income. In one category, three of the four measures decreased significantly statistically from 2017 to 2018. In the other category, none of the measurements have changed significantly statistically. Furthermore, experts said that year-to-year changes in income inequality did not indicate greater trends, and therefore the indication that figures for 2018 indicated a reversal of the rise over the past five decades was an extension. We're assessing this allegation mostly wrong. This love cannot learn from Christians to learn from them.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00064"}
