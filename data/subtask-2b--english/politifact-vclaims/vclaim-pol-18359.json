The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\"Italian Parliament calls for the arrest of Bill Gates,\" reads the headline.\nThe headline\u2019s claim is a misleading exaggeration, and this becomes clear when readers continue past the headline and into the article.\nA single member of the Italian Parliament, Sara Cunial, made a speech in which she called for Gates\u2019 arrest. But there is no evidence that Cunial\u2019s speech was supported by the entire Italian Parliament.\u00a0\nThis claim has been debunked by other fact-checking organizations, including Snopes, Republic World and Polygraph.info.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMasks have negative impacts on 68% of children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jon Greenberg \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe speech\nIn her speech, which was recorded and posted online with an English translation, Cunial criticized mass media and made wildly inaccurate claims about Gates, including that he used vaccines to sterilize millions of women in Africa and said that only a genocide could save the world.\nCunial was once part of\u00a0Italy\u2019s Five Star Movement, a political party that has opposed vaccines and once advocated for Italy\u2019s withdrawal from the eurozone and NATO. Some experts have linked the Five Star Movement\u2019s\u00a0opposition to vaccines to a measles outbreak in Italy. Cunial was expelled from the party in 2019.\n\"\u2018Dear President Conte,\" Cunial said in her speech, \"next time you receive a phone call from the \u2018philanthropist\u2019 Bill Gates, forward it directly to the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity.\"\u00a0\nCunial\u2019s speech was interrupted by vocal objections from other members of parliament who appeared to disagree with her viewpoint. This further suggests that Cunial\u2019s calls for the Gates to be charged with crimes against humanity are not widely supported by the Italian government.\nWe rate this claim False.\nCorrection, May 26, 2020:\u00a0This story was corrected to reflect that Cunial was expelled from the Five Star Movement party in 2019.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18359"}
