The same story has been picked up by multiple websites.\nThe Hungarian-born Soros is a hedge fund manager who has supported liberal causes and backed Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.\nSoros has been a major critic of Trump. After Trump won, Soros called him \"a con artist and would-be dictator.\" At a speech in Davos, Switzerland, in January, Soros said, \"I consider the Trump administration a danger to the world.\"\nSoros has been the target of many online hoaxes, including that his foundations were banned from Austria and false smears, for example that he instigated racial protests in Charlottesville. Soros, who is Jewish, has also been falsely accused of being a Nazi collaborator.\nIn this case, the story said Trump had placed a call to Russia to ask about files related to Soros. The story said Trump used a 2014 executive order by Obama to take such action.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat executive order was real, stating that Obama declared a national emergency to deal with the threat of people undermining democracy in Ukraine. However, there is no evidence that Trump used that order to label Soros a threat to national security.\nSoros has been involved in Ukraine for decades and said he established a foundation there before it declared independence from the Russia. His International Renaissance Foundation has invested tens of millions in \"Ukrainian NGOs, sponsored conferences, scholarships, human-rights confabs and investigative journalists,\" the National Post reported in 2015.\nIn 2015, Soros called on the west to inject $50 billion in Ukraine.\nAdrian Karatnycky, an expert on Ukraine and nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, which promotes engagement in international affairs, said in general Soros is viewed as a positive figure in Ukraine.\n\"He is not overtly in step with a particular political party and political movement,\" he said. \"His foundation is pretty sober-minded, reasonably well regarded in Ukraine.\"\nWe emailed the Conservative Daily Post and did not get a reply. The Las Vegas-based website states that it \"thrives on independent journalism and truth;\" however, the story about Soros is not based in evidence. We found no proof that Trump declared Obama a \"national security threat.\"\nWe rate this story Pants on Fire.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/0ea76c5c-0cac-4a1d-88ab-e1940d64dffe", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02393"}
