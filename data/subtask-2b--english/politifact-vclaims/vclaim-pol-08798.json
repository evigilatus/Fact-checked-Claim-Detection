It was originally posted on the Facebook page of Healthcare.gov, the federal government\u2019s portal to the new insurance marketplace created under President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law. The marketplace is designed to offer one-stop shopping for health insurance plans for Americans whose employers do not offer coverage.\nThe Facebook post claims to be from a man named Will Sheehan. (We couldn\u2019t confirm his identity.) \u00a0The post says that he tried to sign up for Obamacare and then decided to not go along with it; he then said he received an email detailing fines he would face. \u00a0\nHere\u2019s the full text of the post:\n\"I actually made it through this morning at 8:00 A.M. I have a preexisting condition (Type 1 Diabetes) and my income base was 45K-55K annually I chose tier 2 \u2018Silver Plan\u2019 and my monthly premiums came out to $597.00 with $13,988 yearly deductible!!! There is NO POSSIBLE way that I can afford this so I \u2018opt-out\u2019 and chose to continue along with no insurance. I received an email tonight at 5:00 P.M. informing me that my fine would be $4,037 and could be attached to my yearly income tax return. Then you make it to the \u2018REPERCUSSIONS PORTION\u2019 for \u2018non-payment\u2019 of yearly fine. First, your drivers license will be suspended until paid, and if you go 24 consecutive months with \u2018Non-Payment\u2019 and you happen to be a home owner, you will have a federal tax lien placed on your home. You can agree to give your bank information so that they can easy \u2018Automatically withdraw\u2019 your \u2018penalties\u2019 weekly, bi-weekly or monthly! This by no means is \u2018Free\u2019 or even \u2018Affordable\u2019.\"\nWe will check a number of the post\u2019s claims below.\n\u2022 \"There is NO POSSIBLE way that I can afford this so I \u2018opt-out\u2019 and chose to continue along with no insurance.\"\nAccording to a spokesman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the agency that runs the marketplace, this is not how the system works: \"There's no way for people to complete the online application and then affirmatively \u2018opt out\u2019 at the end. They would simply close the website or not enroll in a plan.\"\n\u2022 \"I received an email tonight at 5:00 P.M. informing me\" about the fines I would face.\nThis is wrong on several levels. First, the system would not send any user an email if they failed to complete an application. Second, any fines would be calculated as part of the user\u2019s overall income tax form 1040 -- they wouldn\u2019t be sent as a bill. And third, any taxes would be owed by April 15, 2015 -- a year and a half from now. Someone being assessed a tax penalty by the Internal Revenue Service in early October doesn\u2019t even make any sense, since the applicant has many weeks to find another insurance plan and avoid a penalty.\n\u2022 \"My fine would be $4,037.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis number is way out of line. Under the law, the penalty fee in 2014 is 1 percent of your yearly income or $95 per person for the year, whichever is higher. The fee increases every year. In 2016 it is 2.5 percent of income or $695 per person, whichever is higher.\nIf we are to take this Facebook user\u2019s claims at face value -- that his \"income base was 45K-55K annually\"-- and if he has no dependents, he would not have to pay any more than $550, by 2015. To pay a penalty of $4,037 in 2014, you would need to be making making more than $403,700 a year.\n\u2022 \"Your drivers license will be suspended until paid.\"\nCMS told PolitiFact that nobody\u2019s driver's license will be suspended as a noncompliance penalty under the Affordable Care Act. Nothing in the law mentions that as a penalty, and driver\u2019s licenses are administered by state governments.\n\u2022 \"If you go 24 consecutive months with \u2018Non-Payment\u2019 and you happen to be a home owner, you will have a federal tax lien placed on your home.\"\nA Treasury Department spokesperson confirmed that the law specifically bars the IRS from using their normal means of collecting unpaid taxes, including the use of liens and levy. \u00a0\nAccording to the law, the government \"shall not (i) file notice of lien with respect to any property of a taxpayer by reason of any failure to pay the penalty imposed by this section, or (ii) levy on any such property with respect to such failure.\u2019\u2019\nInstead, the only thing the IRS can do to collect fines is to subtract it from any tax refund you qualify for. If you aren\u2019t due a refund, all the IRS can do is send you a letter.\nAnother section of the health care law protects citizens from any other form of punishment. \u00a0\"In the case of any failure by a taxpayer to timely pay any penalty (\u2026) such taxpayer shall not be subject to any criminal prosecution or penalty,\" it says.\n\u2022 \"You can agree to give your bank information so that they can easy \u2018Automatically withdraw\u2019 your \u2018penalties\u2019 weekly, bi-weekly or monthly!\"\nDon\u2019t take online banking advice from a Facebook post. The Treasury Department warns citizens not to hand out bank information online.\nOur ruling\nThe Facebook post tells the story of a man who says he opted out of Obamacare soon after the marketplace was launched on Oct. 1, 2013, and was informed that he owed a fine of more than $4,000.\nThe post includes many elements that make no sense or are flat-out wrong -- and can be easily debunked by reading the law or reliable summaries of it.
