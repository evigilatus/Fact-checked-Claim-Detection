PolitiFact Ohio wondered how Ohio stacked up on the economic numbers. We asked Faber's office which ones he was talking about.\n\nThe answer: Unemployment and job creation.\n\nEmployment figures are the true measure of the health of a state\u2019s economy, economic experts have told us, which is why they are so frequently cited.\n\nWe checked the numbers released last week by the U.S. Congress Joint Economic Committee.\nIts report showed the unemployment rate in Ohio was 6.7 percent in December 2012, which was more than a point below the national figure of 7.8 -- and down from the most recent peak of 10.6 percent in January 2010.\n\nThe federal Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that Ohio's over-the-year jobs increase through December 2012 (up 90,700), was exceeded only by Texas (260,800), California (225,900) and New York (123,600).\n\nWe found similar significant job growth in a fact-check a couple of months ago.\n\nThat backs up Faber's statement.\n\nBut because two figures are \"both\" and not \"all\" the numbers, we looked at more.\n\nOhio's gross domestic product (GDP), the broadest measure of economic production, totaled $484.0 billion in 2011, the most recent number available. That was 8th largest in the U.S., or above average, but failed to keep pace with growth nationally.\n\nOn a per capita basis, Ohio's GDP of $41,920 was 33rd in the nation.\n\nOhio also ranked 33rd in 2011 in per capita personal income, at $37,836, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. That was below the national average of $41,560.\n\nIn median household income, the most recent figures show Ohio dropping precipitously. Ohio ranked 39th among the states in median household income in 2011, at $44,648, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. That was a drop of 5.7 percent from a year earlier, or more than three times the national average. Ohio ranked 34th in median income the previous year, and 19th a decade earlier in 2000.\n\nThe state's percentage of population living below the poverty line, at 15.1 percent in 2011, was almost unchanged from the previous year, the Census Bureau reported last September. The official poverty rate for the nation was 15 percent, also almost unchanged.\n\nThose numbers help to illustrate that Ohio was one of the half dozen hardest-hit states in the great recession. A recent analysis by JPMorgan Chase, though, says its economy is forecast to grow faster or as fast as the national economy in 2013 -- \"paralleling the national recovery.\"\n\nEven so, while the analysis says \"housing activity is forecast to gradually recover from current levels,\" it also says \"home building remains depressed, as in most other states, and there is little indication yet of a housing revival in Ohio,\" according to data from the Census Bureau and Federal Housing Finance Agency. The growth in house prices lags the national trend.\n\nWhere does that leave Faber?\n\nAt PolitiFact Ohio, words matter. And \"all\" is a little word that covers a lot of territory -- too much to apply to his statement about the economy.\n\nFaber's point about Ohio doing better than average is backed up by what experts have told PolitiFact Ohio are key figures -- unemployment and job creation -- and they are the ones he cited.\n\nOther figures, however, show Ohioans have lost ground economically and trail national averages.\n\nFaber\u2019s statement is partially accurate. But even allowing for political hyperbole, a statement that \"all\" of Ohio\u2019s economic numbers are outpacing averages for the nation omits or overlooks important information.\n\nOn the Truth-O-Meter, his statement rates as Half True.\n\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09763"}
