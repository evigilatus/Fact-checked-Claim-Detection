Rick Perry says the state\u2019s public schools are improving -- in part, he suggested, because state aid is way up. \"Over the past decade,\" Perry said in his Feb. 8 State of the State address, \"the state\u2019s share of public education spending increased from $11 billion per year to $20 billion in \u201809. That\u2019s an 82 percent increase.\"\n\nOur first pass at his analysis proved a snap after reaching the Legislative Budget Board, which advises lawmakers on budgetary matters. Its staff spokesman, John Barton, said the board shared spending figures with Perry before his speech. Separately, Perry spokeswoman Catherine Frazier pointed us to a chart showing that in 2000, state aid totaled around $10 billion and the board\u2019s 2008-09 \"Fiscal Size-up\" projected the aid to be about double that in 2009.\n\nBarton said the state spent $11.1 billion on public education aid in 2000. According to LBB staff, the state spent $20.3 billion on such aid in 2009--$9.2 billion, or 84 percent, more than before.\n\nWhat drove the increase? More students, for starters. Texas public schools served more than 4.8 million students in 2008-09, the Texas Education Agency says -- 20 percent more than in 1998-99.\n\nWhat else? School finance expert and lobbyist Lynn Moak, whose clients include a consortium of the state\u2019s largest school districts, said other factors that boosted state aid between 1998-99 and 2008-09 included legislated increases in teacher pay and health care coverage, supported by increasing local tax revenue driven by surging property values.\n\nMoak said another major factor driving state aid was the 2006 decision by GOP lawmakers and Perry to mandate lower school property taxes and make up the difference in lost revenue going forward. According to LBB research, nearly $18.6 billion in state aid went to the schools in 2008 compared with $12.1 billion in 2006, before the tax swap took effect. Meanwhile, local funds spent on public education dropped slightly to $18.2 billion in 2008, compared with $19.9 billion in 2006. All told, school spending (from federal, state and local funds) amounted to nearly $41 billion in 2008.\n\nBut school districts in 2008-09 also had more money to spend per pupil, according to TEA calculations included in year-by-year pocket guides to school statistics. In 1998-99, operating expenditures averaged $5,668 per pupil. Adjusting for inflation, that amount would have been about $6,720 by 2008-09. The actual per-pupil operating expenditure was $8,572, the TEA says.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe guides reminded us of another way to size up state spending on public education: by comparing it to the total spent from all sources, meaning local, state and federal funds. According to the guides, the state picked up 46 percent of school districts\u2019 spending in 1998-99. That share was less than 43 percent in 2008-09. During Perry\u2019s decade as governor, the state\u2019s portion hit a low of 34 percent in 2005-06 and a high of 45 percent in 2007-08.\n\nSo, the state spent 84 percent more money in 2008-09 than before and per-student spending from all funding sources also was higher. Yet the state\u2019s share of education spending -- a telling indicator of state support for the schools -- was down from what it was a decade earlier.\n\nWe contacted Perry\u2019s office about these aspects. Frazier said the governor stands behind his speech statement.\n\nWe rate the statement Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13497"}
