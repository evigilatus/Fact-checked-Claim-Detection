AZ POPULATION IS 7,270,000.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nWhile the claim gets the population of Arizona right, it\u2019s wrong about the number of registered voters Facebook is reporting there. Here\u2019s why.\u00a0\nFacebook\u2019s tally of registered voters, which users will sometimes see pinned to the top of their newsfeeds, displays the number of people in the U.S. who\u2019ve used Facebook\u2019s interface to share that they have registered to vote. The figure is not representative only of those in Arizona \u2014 or any other single state, for that matter.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.

The website\u2019s voting information center also provides details on how to check your registration status and information on where to register, including a link to the user\u2019s state registration website or a voting information organization.\u00a0\nA spokesperson for Facebook confirmed to PolitiFact that it hasn't shared the number of registered voters by region or state, and said the post is likely referring to the total number of users around the U.S. who\u2019ve shared that they registered, which updates in real time. A tally showing that figure appears above the words \"People who shared they registered to vote in the United States.\"\nThe user\u2019s state is listed above that tally, but the number isn\u2019t specific to that state:\n\n\u00a0\nAccording to the Arizona Secretary of State\u2019s website, as of August 2020 there were 3,989,214 registered voters, with 1,389,960 registered as Republican and 1,293,074 registered as Democrat. The remaining are registered under \"other\" or Liberatarian.\u00a0\n\nAs of July 2019, the population of Arizona stood just over 7.2 million, with 22.5%, or about 1.6 million, being under the age of 18 and therefore not eligible to vote, according to Census data.\nThis post gets Arizona\u2019s population right, but the rest of the claim is wrong.\nWe rate this post Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18588"}
