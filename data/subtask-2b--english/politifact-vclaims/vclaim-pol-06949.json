Jeb Bush says yes", "text": "Failing test scores aren't\u00a0the only problem that has caused the military to reject applicants, says former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. Another problem\u00a0is, well, more colorful: tattoos.\nWhile talking about his push to improve public education at the Wall Street Journal CEO Council event Dec. 1, Bush pointed to problems the military has finding qualified applicants.\nBush mentioned a video in which a military official talked about the challenge:\n\"In the video beforehand, Gen. Dempsey talked about a 25 percent pass rate. Now that\u2019s not just because of the test, that\u2019s also because of obesity, and too many tattoos, to be honest with you, on visible body parts for people that are trying to get into the military. But the pass rate for a high-school-level test to join the military is about 35 percent, I think, or 40 percent at best. These are abysmal numbers.\"\nPolitiFact has previously fact-checked claims about whether obesity and physical fitness have kept applicants out of the military (both true).\u00a0But we hadn\u2019t explored the role of tattoos in filling the military ranks. We couldn\u2019t resist taking a look.\nTattoo policies\nEach branch of the service sets their own rules about tattoos, but it was the Army\u2019s policy that has drawn the most ink recently\u00a0from the media.\nIn March 2014, the Army overhauled its appearance policy, which includes more than two pages of detailed rules about \"tattoo, branding and body mutilation.\"\nThis led to a rush to get tatted\u00a0so soldiers could be grandfathered in under the new rules. The Army has a detailed procedure for grandfathering that directs unit commanders to document each tattoo in an official memorandum.\nThe Army\u2019s policy states that tattoos, regardless of subject matter, are prohibited on certain areas of the body, including the wrists, hands and fingers, as well as the head, face, and neck, defined as \"anything above the t-shirt neck line to include on/inside the eyelids, mouth, and ears.\"\n\"Soldiers may have no more than four visible tattoos below the elbow (to the wrist bone) or below the knee,\" the policy says.\nSo far under the new policy, 2,919 applicants could not process due to tattoos,\u00a0said Brian Lepley, an Army recruiting spokesman. \"Those 2,919 are the ones whose tattoos were so egregious it was highly unlikely a waiver could get through, or the applicant chose not to try a waiver,\" he said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Army, 193 tattoo waivers for applicants have been granted, while one was rejected and four are pending.\nLepley told us that tattoos are not the No. 1 disqualifier. Medical conditions, drug use, misconduct or some combination of those issues disqualify more applicants.\nNews reports around the country indicate the tattoo\u00a0policy is limiting applicants, though.\n\"Right now, with the new tattoo policy in effect, we currently turn away one in every five applicants that come through our door,\" U.S. Army Captain Joshua Jacquez told CNN in a report from El Paso.\nMaj. Gen. Allen W. Batschelet, head of Army recruiting at Fort Knox, told the Kansas City Star\u00a0in August that the policy is, \"rather arbitrary, in some sense.\" However he said that \"you have to draw the line somewhere\" for the Army to present a professional image.\nAs for waivers, Batschelet said,\u00a0\"To be blunt, the higher quality of applicant you are, the more tolerance we'd probably have for seeking a waiver. If you came in to sign up today and were a neurosurgeon, I got to tell you I'd go a long way toward trying to get an exception if all you had was a disqualifying tattoo.\"\nThe Air Force,\u00a0Marines and Navy also have their own tattoo policies. All of them generally ban tattoos that are obscene, advocate discrimination or express offensive views.\nThe Air Force policy has a seven-step measurement guide that contains math formulas in an attempt to prevent tattoos from covering more than 25 percent of an exposed body part. (Partial inches should be rounded up to the nearest inch, it says.)\nThe Marines policy states that applicants with more than four tattoos must be administratively reviewed.\nThe Navy\u2019s policy is the least detailed --\u00a0only 277 words -- though like the other services, it bans head tattoos.\nOur ruling\nBush said that among the reasons applicants are rejected by the military -- in addition to being obese or not passing the test -- is that some have \"too many tattoos\" on visible body parts.\nSince the Army updated its tattoo policy earlier this year, 2,919 applicants could not proceed due to tattoos. Other branches of the service also have restrictions on types and locations of tattoos that keep some applicants out of the military.\nWe rate this claim True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06949"}
