The US dollar is stronger than ever.", "text": "Is the United States dollar stronger than other currencies than it ever was? President Donald Trump said that - at least four times in one day. First, on August 21, 2019, Trump wrote that the United States had the \"most dollar in history.\" So Germany pays zero interest and is actually paid to borrow money, while the United States, which is much stronger and more important credit, pays interest and stops (I hope!) Quantum tightening. The strongest dollar in history is very difficult for exports. - Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTromp) August 21, 2019 a few hours later, Trump told the White House journalists, \"Last we had the strongest dollar in our country's history.\" He then reiterated two more times. (Notes begin at around 10:31 in this video.) Trump was not quite encouraging, as he admitted in his comments, but he noticed that having a strong dollar also had flaws. A strong dollar can benefit Americans travelling abroad, because their dollar will go even further in local currency. But the downside is that US exports cost more abroad. This is detrimental to the commercial output of the United States and can exacerbate the trade imbalance in the United States. We wondered whether Trump was right that the United States dollar had recently set a new historical rise vis-\u00e0-vis foreign exchange. That didn't happen.

By Samantha Butterman: January 11, 2021, the most common method for tracking the total strength of the dollar is the United States dollar index, a statistical calculated for decades. It is based on a weighted average exchange rate in the United States in six currencies: primarily the euro, but also the Japanese yen, the British pound, the Canadian dollar, the Swedish krona and the Swiss franc. According to this indicator, the dollar has recently been stronger than the number of days between December 2016 and March 2017, and remains stronger between late 1999 and early 2003. The dollar was at the peak of its historical strength during parts of the early to mid-1980s. Trump did not specify any foreign currency to compare it, but the examination of some large currencies also shows that Trump is not right here. According to internal market calculations, the dollar is nowhere near the historical heights of the comparisons per euro, yen or yawn. As at 20 August, the euro could have purchased $1.11 - but the euro could often buy less than its equivalent between 2015 and 2017, and the record decline of $0.64 was in 1985. This compares with the European currency unit (ECU) or the European currency unit (ECU), euro advances. Meanwhile, on August 20, one dollar could buy 106 yen. But the dollar has been stronger for a long time since 2014 and much of the time between 1998 and 2008. The dollar can buy a record 358.44 yen in January 1971. Finally, on August 20, a dollar can buy 7.06 Chinese yuan. The dollar was stronger between 2000 and 2008 at least. Torben Andersen, Director, International Business and Market Programme, Kellogg School of Administration, Northwestern University, said. \"The United States dollar is strong, but nowhere strong as in the mid-1980s.\" Anderson added that the strength of the dollar was \"natural growth of better economic growth and higher interest rates in the United States than in most other Western developed economies.\" Our Governor Trump said, \" Yesterday we had the strongest dollar in our country's history.\" This is not the case - the total dollar index and comparisons between one and one euros, yen and yen have all been stronger for the United States for a long time in recent years. We're assessing the statement wrong. Clarification, August 23: This material has been updated to show that the strongest exchange rate of the dollar on date against the euro was in fact against the euro &apos; s advance currency, the European Monetary Union.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00246"}
