It got to the point where Gingrich felt he needed to address his apparent rhetorical contradiction in a Facebook post titled, \"My position on Libya.\"\n\nFirst, we\u2019ll look at the two comments that drove the questions about Gingrich\u2019s stance.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first comment came during a March 7, 2011, \u00a0interview with Greta Van Susteren of Fox News. Here\u2019s an excerpt.\n\nVan Susteren: \"First let me ask you about Libya. It's in the news. The president has said that military options with NATO are not off the table. What would you do about Libya?\"\n\nGingrich: \"Exercise a no-fly zone this evening, communicate to the Libyan military that Gadhafi was gone and that the sooner they switch sides, the more like they were to survive, provided help to the rebels to replace him. I mean, the idea that we're confused about a man who has been an anti-American dictator since 1969 just tells you how inept this administration is. They were very quick to jump on Mubarak, who was their ally for 30 years, and they were confused about getting rid of Gadhafi. This is a moment to get rid of him. Do it. Get it over with. \u2026\n\n\"All we have to say is that we think that slaughtering your own citizens is unacceptable and that we're intervening. And we don't have to send troops. All we have to do is suppress his air force, which we could do in minutes. And then we have to say publicly that he is gone, that the military should switch sides now, and we should help the rebels. And if that means getting them weapons or whatever it means, the fact that there's no more Libyan air power and the fact that the United States has publicly come out for decisively replacing him, I suspect the military will dump him.\"\n\nNow let\u2019s look at the second comment that attracted attention. It was made during a March 23, 2011, interview with Matt Lauer on NBC\u2019s Today show.\n\nLauer: \"Do you think Moammar Gadhafi has to go as a result of this military intervention?\"\n\nGingrich: \"I think that now -- let me draw a distinction. I would not have intervened. I think there were a lot of other ways to affect Gadhafi. I think there are a lot of allies in the region that we could have worked with. I would not have used American and European forces, bombing Arab and that country.\"\n\nIn the blogosphere, critics on both the left and the right charged that Gingrich had flip-flopped. The liberal blog ThinkProgress wrote that \"there is no other reasonable explanation for Gingrich\u2019s complete flip-flop\" than \"opportunism and news media publicity.\" At the conservative blog site Hot Air, the anonymous AllahPundit suggested that Gingrich\u2019s comments amounted to a flip-flop and asked, \"Is this anti-Obama pandering or just a big misunderstanding?\"\n\nWe won\u2019t address whether Gingrich\u2019s position in either interview was accurate or justified. We\u2019ll only look at whether Gingrich changed his position between March 7 and March 23, and if so, whether any extenuating circumstances can help explain his shift.\n\nIn his March 23, 2011, Facebook post, Gingrich dismissed the notion that he had flip-flopped, arguing that the apparent contradictory positions in the two interviews were actually consistent.\n\nGingrich\u2019s argument hinges on a difference between what he would have liked to have done in theory, and what he felt he had to do given the actions Obama took. The key moment for Gingrich came on March 3, 2011, when Obama declared that Gadhafi had to go.\n\n\"Going forward,\" Obama said, \"we will continue to send a clear message: The violence must stop. Moammar Gadhafi has lost the legitimacy to lead, and he must leave. Those who perpetrate violence against the Libyan people will be held accountable. And the aspirations of the Libyan people for freedom, democracy and dignity must be met.\"\n\nGingrich said in his Facebook post that prior to the March 3 statement \"there were options to be indirect and subtle to achieve this result without United States military forces. \u2026 The president, however, took those options off the table with his public statement. From the moment of the president\u2019s declaration, he put the prestige and authority of the United States on the line. After March 3, anything short of a successful, public campaign for regime change would have been seen as a defeat for the United States.\n\n\"That\u2019s why during a March 7th Greta van Susteren interview, I asserted that the president should establish a no-fly zone \u2018this evening.\u2019 After March 3rd, the President should have moved immediately to consult with Congress to implement a no-fly zone, while also making it clear the U.S. would welcome involvement from other nations.\"\n\nGingrich concluded the post by reinforcing his support for the mission. \"Now that we have U.S. forces engaged, any result less than the removal of Gadhafi from power will be considered a defeat,\" he said. \"For that reason, I believe we must support the mission and see it through.\"\n\nGingrich has not persuaded us that his comments were consistent. The best evidence supporting Gingrich\u2019s explanation is that he did raise some of the themes from his Facebook post during the interview with Today. Gingrich reminded Lauer that \"the president said on March 3rd Gadhafi has to go,\" and he raised the possibility that a \u00a0failure could be harmful to the United States\u2019 standing. \"Having decided to go there, if Gadhafi does not leave power it will be a defeat for the United States,\" Gingrich told Lauer. \"It will lengthen our engagement, it will increase our costs.\"\n\nHowever, if Gingrich\u2019s position is that he was making two separate arguments -- a hypothetical one about what he would have done prior to Obama\u2019s March 3 statement, and a practical one about what he would do once the U.S. had crossed the Rubicon of advocating Gadhafi\u2019s ouster -- he didn\u2019t do a very clear job of explaining himself. In neither interview did he frame the arguments in that fashion. So we think it\u2019s reasonable for viewers to conclude that he\u2019d flip-flopped on the issue of imposing a no-fly zone.\n\nSo where does this leave us? Gingrich has a point that Obama\u2019s March 3 declaration about Gadhafi had consequences, and if Gingrich had provided that context of his thinking in both interviews, he could have made a reasonable argument that the two statements were consistent. However, Gingrich didn\u2019t clarify his comments in that way until after he started taking heat for having flip-flopped. Because he didn\u2019t, we give him a Full Flop.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13369"}
