The tweet claimed Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, is planning drastic measures to take away guns.\n\"WARNING\u2026 VIRGINIA GOV RALPH NORTHAM SET TO.. Cut off electric\u2026 telephones\u2026 faxes\u2026 cellular phones & cellular data, Internet, so #Virginia residents cannot reveal what is happening once gun confiscation begins to take place,\" the tweet reads.\nThe Facebook post, which has been shared nearly 10,000 times, was flagged as part of the company\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\n(Screenshot from Facebook)\nThere\u2019s no evidence for this disconnected conspiracy.\nWhile a variety of gun control legislation has been introduced in Virginia, one bill is particularly relevant to the Facebook post and tweet: Virginia Senate Bill 16. The measure, which was introduced in late November, would ban the possession, transport and sale of assault weapons. The bill includes six definitions for \"assault weapons,\" which include anything from a semi-automatic rifle to a shotgun with a revolving cylinder.\nDemocrats will take control of both the Senate and the House of Delegates in January, which helps the chances for passage. But there\u2019s no evidence that Northam would cut off the state\u2019s electricity to enforce the legislation or suppress news about enforcement.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSB 16, which would make the possession of an assault weapon a felony, does not spell out how it would deal with firearms that Virginians already own. Northam has said he would call on law enforcement to enforce the bill, and he\u2019s pushed back on resolutions that deem certain cities \"Second Amendment sanctuaries.\"\u00a0\n\"We're not going to take people's guns away,\" he told reporters Dec. 11.\nRELATED:\u00a0All statements involving Guns\nIn its tweet, which got more than 2,000 retweets, @cindyseestruth linked to a story published Dec. 13 by the Hal Turner Radio Show. Other Twitter bots have also amplified the article, according to Hoaxy, a tool that tracks automated accounts.\nHal Turner is a white supremacist who uses internet and radio broadcasts to float conspiracy theories and hate speech. In 2010, he was sentenced to 33 months in prison for threatening three federal judges over their decision to uphold handgun bans in Chicago.\nThe story contains the tweet\u2019s claim about shutting down cellular infrastructure almost verbatim. In an email, Alena Yarmosky, Northam\u2019s press secretary, said that it is \"absolutely false.\"\n\"People who spread lies like this should be ashamed of themselves,\" she said.\nWe reached out to Turner for more evidence to support his site\u2019s claim, but we haven\u2019t heard back.\nThe Facebook posts are inaccurate and make a ridiculous claim.
