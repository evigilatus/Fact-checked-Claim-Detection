The President &apos; s claim appears to be contrary to criticism from some Georgian legislators and activists who say that the federal government has done little to prevent people from illegally crossing the United States border and discouraging employers from recruiting illegal immigrants. We decided to verify Obama &apos; s claim. National Security spokesman Stephen Creepy told us that there are currently 20,745 border patrol agents. About 85% of them patrol the U.S.-Mexico border. The rest patrol the U.S.-Canada border. Krippy said there were 17,499 clients by the end of September 2008, approximately four months before Obama took office. A decade ago, in 2001, there were some 9,000 border guards, according to a March 2010 report compiled by the Congressional Research Service of the United States of America for Congress. In 1992, the first year mentioned in the report, there were 3,555 clients along the south-west border. Some 300 clients patroled the northern border in 1992. The federal statements were not challenged by an official working with the Union for the Reform of American Migration, who supports the stricter guidelines for illegal migration. However, the official said that Obama should not be insulted. \"The border patrol is growing markedly under Obama's rule as well as [under the presidency of former President George W. Bush,\" said Jack Martin, the director of the FAIR Special Projects. \"So he can take credit for it - but not all credit. The great stimulus was to focus on border control in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks.\" The Congressional report endorses Martin &apos; s point of view. The number of clients almost doubled during the Bush presidency. However, the average annual increase of border patrol officers since Obama took office is almost the same as Bush. Marshall Fitz, Director of Immigration Policy at the Center for American Progress, said that the strongest critics of immigration policy are \"continuing the transfer of the target\" in this case because it is easier to say that border patrols are wrong than what he said are the most complex issues with regard to irregular migration. The Center for American Progress is an organization that has pushed the federal government to help illegal immigrants pay taxes and obtain legal status in the United States of America, Fitz said that the President's claim was \"right,\" but noted that there may have been times when there were more customers on the south-west border. He referred to 1954, when an estimated 750,000 illegal immigrants left the United States to avoid border repression. Experts say there may have been only 750 agents leading the assembly process. Our colleagues at the Poletti Fructte national site dealt with a similar allegation by the President in July 2010 when he said that the United States had more border patrols along the Mexican border \"from any time in our history. They took into account the Mexican journey in the early 20th century prior to their rule. :: Polyte Fact noted that President Woodrow Wilson sent between 75,000 and 150,000 troops to the United States-Mexico border in 1916 to suppress a sudden attack in Columbus, New Mexico. And here's part of what led them to give Obama the right verdict in most of it: \"We have clients more than ever since the early 1990s. But there were times in our history when the United States sent troops to the border, and many more people there to guard the border today.\" Federal data indicate that the number of clients patrolling the United States border has risen to its highest levels in the past two decades. There are historical data showing that there was at least one period in American history in which there were many other authorities patrolling the border. Because of this, the President &apos; s claim is often assessed as valid. On February 1, 2021, Tom Cotton mentioned in an interview with Fox and friends \"Many of these arriving immigrants, we have no way of checking their background for either health or security.\" \u25cf February 3, 2012", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13179"}
