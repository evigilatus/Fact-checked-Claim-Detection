Headlined, \"This is what liberalism will buy you,\" the meme features a photograph of a sign with removable letters, purportedly advertising a group called the Advancement of Islamic Agenda for America. The sign reads, \"Allah be praised. America we will kill you all and nothing you can do to stop it. Allah be praised.\" The meme concludes with the line, \"Still think they are kidding.\" (The question mark for that last sentence was mysteriously missing.)\nA pretty scary sign if true. But is it? Hardly.\nWe searched for a group called Advancement of Islamic Agenda for America on the Web and found no trace of it. More importantly, the sign comes from a template on the website Church Sign Maker.\nThe site allows people to create photos of church signs conveying any message they choose. The site allows users to \"create your own funny photos and graphics -- simply type in some text and choose from a few simple options. You can create your own church sign, make an official seal, have your own fire or police badge, and more.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.
