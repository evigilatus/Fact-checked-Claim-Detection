Cohen, senior executive vice president of Comcast, also cited it\u00a0in a recent editorial. Is it legitimate? \u00a0\u00a0\nKenney\u2019s communications director, Lauren Hitt, said Kenney got the statistic\u00a0from the Economy League, which used\u00a0a study from ReadyNation/America\u2019s Edge, an organization with a goal of strengthening business \"through better policies for children and youth.\" Cohen specifically mentioned the same study in his editorial.\nThe study examines the total dollar effect of $1 in pre-K spending on the state\u2019s output. Using a tool called the IMPLAN model, it theorizes that the money spent on pre-kindergarten would lead to new learning centers and new teachers and staff. Those new learning centers would spend locally on supplies and other resources for the pre-K programs, and the teachers would spend the money on food, clothes, restaurants and whatever else they\u2019d need. The businesses would in turn hire more people to meet the increased demand. The estimated economic effect would be an additional 79 cents generated in the economy per dollar spent on pre-k for a total of $1.79.\nTim Bartik, author of \"Investing in Kids: Early Childhood Programs and Local Economic Development\" said the study\u2019s estimate of an additional 79 cents generated per dollar of spending is probably high because it doesn\u2019t take possible tax increases into account, which is the way many early childhood education programs are financed. Kenney hopes to fund the annual $60 million to fund pre-K through a soda tax. Bartik said the likely effect of $1 on pre-K spending, given a tax increase, would be the dollar spent for pre-K and perhaps a little extra.\n\"I could imagine it being greater than a dollar,\" said Bartik, who is also a senior economist for the Upjohn Institute and has received a research grant from ReadyNation. \"How much greater I couldn\u2019t say. It would be a lot of work to get the right answer.\" \u00a0\nHe said the estimated impact of an extra 79 cents for every dollar spent was not likely unless the pre-kindergarten program was privately financed.\nSteve Doster, the Pennsylvania director for ReadyNation/America\u2019s Edge, confirmed the study did not take into account how each $1 spent on pre-K would be raised, such as through an increase of taxes. \u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPat Toomey\n\n\nstated on January 19, 2021 in a hearing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere will be several thousand dollars in payments going to families with six-figure incomes who\u2019ve had no income interruption whatsoever.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jessica Calefati \u2022 January 21, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When this report was generated it was generated looking at significant public investment from Pennsylvania,\" Doster said.\nThis doesn\u2019t mean expanded pre-K couldn\u2019t have major benefits. In fact, Bartik said the total economic impact from $1 of pre-K spending could be as much as $3 to $5. But that estimate would include benefits from freeing the time of parents of pre-kindergarten students who could work more hours or gain more skills, the possibility of increased earnings of pre-kindergarten students years down the line and the spillover effects from both of those scenarios. The study being referenced by Kenney and Cohen -- and that would be of most interest to the business community -- is about the short run, the total dollar impact of one dollar spent on pre-kindergarten on the state output. \u00a0\u00a0\nRon Haskins said there hasn\u2019t been much other research to back the estimates laid out in the ReadyNation/America\u2019s Edge study but reaffirmed what Bartik and several other studies have pointed out in terms of overall economic benefits. No matter what kind of positive economic effect is being predicted, the total would depend on the unknown: the quality of the program. For pre-kindergarten to pay off for businesses or children, it must provide a good education across the board. \u00a0\n\"I want to emphasize,\" Haskins said. \"Without quality, forget the 79 cents.\"\nOur ruling\nMayor Jim Kenney cited a study saying every dollar spent on pre-k education in Pennsylvania would yield $1.79 for the state economy. Comcast\u2019s David L. Cohen noted the same study in an editorial. \u00a0\nWhile studies and experts agree the economic impact of quality pre-kindergarten programs could be substantial, the study pointed out by Kenney is about shorter-term effects on the state\u2019s output. Taxes required to pay for the pre-K program could lessen the economic effect, adding up to less than an extra 79 cents per dollar spent. \u00a0\nBut research and expert opinion illustrate quality pre-K likely will have a substantial, positive effect on the local economy. \u00a0\nWe rule the claim Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05335"}
