Not even 2 percent, mind you: 0.2 percent.\"\nWe have taken a look at this general topic before but haven\u2019t rated this particular assertion, so we\u2019ll do it here.\nA look at the numbers\nWe turned to data from the Center for Responsive Politics, an independent clearinghouse for campaign finance data.\nClinton has raised $307,561 from people employed by the oil and gas industry. It\u2019s worth noting that not all this money comes from people with deep pockets; this total includes donations from everyone employed by the industry, from CEOs to gas-station employees.\nAltogether, Clinton\u2019s campaign has raised more than $180 million, so the percentage raised from employees of the oil and gas industry works out to 0.17 percent -- which is actually a bit less than Mook said.\nBy comparison, Sanders has raised less from oil and gas employees than Clinton has -- $53,760 -- which amounts to 0.03 percent of the $182 million his campaign has raised.\nIn any case, this particular statistic looks solid on the math.\nThat said, we\u2019ll raise a caveat.\nMook\u2019s narrow focus\nMook has worded the claim carefully to exclude other donations, which amounts to a bit of cherry-picking.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden canceled the Keystone pipeline because Warren Buffett \u201cdonated $58 million\u201d to his campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMook refers to \"employees.\" But as the Sanders campaign has argued -- citing analyses by Greenpeace and the Huffington Post -- Clinton\u2019s campaign has also received donations from lobbyists who have ties to oil and gas interests. These donations would not be reported as having come from employees of oil and gas companies and thus aren\u2019t included in the total we calculated above.\nThe Huffington Post article, from July 17, 2015, found that \"nearly all of the lobbyists bundling contributions for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign have at one time or another worked for the fossil fuel industry.\" It links to 40 registered lobbyists but only offers details on some donors who still work for the industry.\nThe Greenpeace report says that when you add in donations by lobbyists with an alleged tie to the fossil fuel industry, Clinton's total would rise to nearly $1.8 million. The fossil fuel industry's share of the Clinton coffers would go up to about 0.8 percent.\nThe Sanders campaign added that the Greenpeace report goes a step further to include more than $4 million to Priorities Action USA, the super PAC that supports Clinton. And the Sanders team said that Chevron, ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil have donated at least $2.5 million to the Clinton Foundation.\n\"I understand the Clinton campaign objects to these figures, because some of the fossil fuel lobbyists who have bundled huge sums of money for their campaign also represent clients in other industries,\" said Sanders spokesman Warren Gunnels. \"In our view, that makes these contributions even more objectionable. It's the lobbyists in Washington who write the bills and curry special favors for the firms they represent. You can't reform big oil and gas companies by taking bundled campaign cash from their lobbyists.\"\nThe Sanders critique is not a slam-dunk, however\nFor starters, it\u2019s a stretch to draw a direct line between those super PAC donations and Clinton\u2019s campaign. Under federal law, the candidates have no control over super PAC spending.\nIn addition, it\u2019s up for debate how significant these lobbyists\u2019 donations are. It\u2019s not clear how much of\u00a0influence the oil and gas industry would wield through a donor who once lobbied for them but doesn\u2019t any more. In some cases, the lobbyists advocated for clients in multiple industries, not just oil and gas.\u00a0\nFinally, Clinton\u2019s stances on oil and gas issues is not exactly in tune with the industry. She has said that if individuals from the industry want to donate to her, they should know that they may be wasting their money. She favors policies the oil and gas industry doesn\u2019t like, and she is a big supporter of renewable energy, a philosophy Sanders has also embraced.\nOur ruling\nMook wrote, \"In last week\u2019s debate, Bernie questioned Hillary\u2019s commitment to fighting climate change because a whopping 0.2 percent of the money given to our campaign has come from employees of oil and gas companies. Not even 2 percent, mind you: 0.2 percent.\"\nMook\u2019s statement is accurate, though it\u2019s carefully constructed to exclude donations by lobbyists who have at one time represented the industry -- a point made by Sanders, though its relevance is up for debate. The statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f1dfea64-4e60-4564-9663-e348645568ed", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05064"}
