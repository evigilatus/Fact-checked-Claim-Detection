The bill did not mention any potential beneficiary.\nBut within weeks, the beneficiary became clear when the EDC approved a $75-million loan guarantee for 38 Studios. The company ultimately went bankrupt; the EDC, now the Rhode Island Commerce Corporation, owes a total of \u00a0$115.9 million in principal, interest and fees to repay the bonds.\nAt least two prominent Rhode Island politicians vigorously opposed the deal when it was proposed.\nLincoln Chafee, when he was running for governor as an independent in 2010, repeatedly urged the EDC to reject the proposal. He repeatedly tried to address the EDC directly and showed up at one of its meetings, only to be rebuffed.\nThen-General Treasurer Frank Caprio, a Democrat also running for governor, eventually joined Chafee in his opposition, to the point where Gov. Donald Carcieri, who chaired the EDC, complained, \"The attitudes and positions taken by Mr. Caprio and Mr. Chafee serve only to undermine the positive economic development steps the state has taken in recent years.\"\nWhere was Raimondo, then a candidate for general treasurer, in all this?\nOn July 16, 2010, she wrote an email to Keith Stokes, then EDC's director, expressing \"significant concerns.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I would proceed very carefully on this,\" she wrote. \"The fact that many have looked at it and passed is a red flag,\" a reference to other groups that had decided not to help finance the 38 Studios venture.\nSo she was clearly voicing serious concerns.\nIn addition, Raimondo's TV commercial references The Providence Journal of July 22, 2010, where an Ed Fitzpatrick column quotes Raimondo as saying, \"Truly, this is a gamble. This company hasn\u2019t launched a game yet. It\u2019s pre-revenue; they haven\u2019t made one penny. This could very easily be out of business in a year or two.\"\nThe column appeared two days before the EDC took its final vote on the 38 Studios deal.\nFitzpatrick, paraphrasing Raimondo, wrote: \"Venture capitalists prefer to spread risk among a portfolio of 20 to 30 companies, but this $75-million loan guarantee is a big chunk of the state's new $125-million Job Creation Guaranty Program.\"\nThen he quoted Raimondo as saying, \"This strategy is like, 'put all your chips on red and cross your fingers. It makes me nervous.'\"\nBut neither example shows Raimondo actively fighting the project.\nWe asked Raimondo's campaign if it had any evidence of the candidate trying to block the deal. Spokeswoman Joy Fox said Raimondo met with Stokes and separately with Karl Wadensten, the only EDC member to vote against the proposal.\nWe checked with Wadensten. He said he asked her about the pending deal during commercial breaks when he had her on his WPRO radio show.\nAsked about Raimondo's claim that she fought the deal, he responded, \"With who? That's what I'm trying to figure out. With who? I had already made up my mind at that point.\" He said he couldn't recall how strongly she advised against the deal.\nOur ruling\nGina Raimondo says, \"I fought 38 Studios from the beginning.\"\nIt's clear Raimondo had concerns about the deal.\nBut calling something \"a gamble,\" saying a deal makes you \"nervous\" and urging someone to \"proceed very carefully\" signals opposition but doesn't rise to the level of fighting.\nWe couldn't find -- and her campaign couldn't produce -- any evidence that she actively tried to block the 38 Studios loan or that she specifically told anyone in authority that the deal should be rejected.\nTo say she \"fought 38 Studios\" is a big stretch. We rate her claim as Mostly False.\n(If you have a claim you\u2019d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, email us at [email\u00a0protected] And follow us on Twitter: @politifactri.)", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07058"}
