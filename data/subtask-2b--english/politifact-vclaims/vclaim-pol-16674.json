(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nWe could find no evidence in internet searches or archived news databases that support the claim that women used to \"beg\" for their husbands forgiveness during the holidays. The image has been shared online for years, with the Christmas tradition description being attached to it later on.\u00a0\nPrevious postings of the image contain different explanations as to what\u2019s going on in the photo. A reverse-image search showed that it was widely circulated on various websites in 2014 with captions that simply said \"women begging men\" (with no mention of Christmas, marital relationships, or forgiveness).\nIt has also been shared on many Russian-language websites for years.

Ladies invite gentlemen to the White Dance, 1900.\"\nA \"white dance\" festival in Russia has been described as an event in which the women ask men to be their dates, similar to a \"Sadie Hawkins\" dance in the United States.\nJim Leary, emeritus professor of folklore at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told PolitiFact that he hasn\u2019t ever encountered evidence of any seasonal tradition like the one described in the Facebook post.\u00a0\nLeary said there are major seasonal traditions, such as the Jewish holy day, Yom Kippur, where atonement and forgiveness figure, but he is only aware of reciprocal practices, rather than one-way traditions regarding forgiveness between couples.\nHe called \"ridiculous\" the claim that \"\u2018women\u2019 (what women? since not all women share the same traditions) apologized so abjectly to their husbands, who the implication is had nothing to apologize for\" and said it sounded more like a \"patriarchal fantasy\" than anything based in reality.\nWhat\u2019s more, this version of the image we saw on Facebook included, in hard-to-read type, the words \"Shitz & Giggles\" in the lower portion of the photo, with the url \"facebook.com/theshiggles,\" an account that says it posts \"comedy, memes, humor and other stuff to make you laugh out loud.\" Despite that, commenters who found the item shared by a non-comedy account wondered if it was real.
