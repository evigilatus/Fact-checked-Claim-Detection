(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nThe story says that, as part of a lawsuit settlement with consumer groups, the FDA was forced to publicly admit that \"all \u2018silver\u2019 dental fillings are poisoned with mercury.\"\u00a0\nIt\u2019s referring to dental amalgam, a filling material dentists use to fill cavities. According to the FDA, its primary component is elemental mercury. Amalgam fillings are also known as \"silver fillings\" because of their silver-like appearance. The agency says such fillings have been used in hundreds of millions of patients around the world for over a century, and are beneficial because they\u2019re strong and less likely to break than those made of other materials.\nBut there are also risks. Amalgam releases low levels of mercury vapor that can be inhaled and absorbed by the lungs.\u00a0\nHigh levels of mercury vapor exposure can harm the brain and kidneys. The FDA says it reviewed scientific evidence to determine whether low levels of mercury vapor from dental amalgam fillings were cause for concern. Based on the evidence, according to the agency, the FDA considers them safe for adults and children 6 and older.\u00a0\nBut fetuses and young children may be more sensitive to the \"neurotoxic effects of mercury vapor,\" according to the FDA. It says there is \"very limited to no\" clinical data on the long-term health outcomes for pregnant women, their fetuses and young children, and advises concerned patients to talk to their dentists.\nThe agency also discourages patients from removing their dental amalgams if they\u2019re in good condition and there\u2019s no tooth decay under the filling because, in part, it could expose that person to additional mercury vapor released during the removal process.\nThough the Principia Scientific story was published in 2018, it uses an FDA statement from 2008 to show that the agency \"was finally forced to admit\" amalgam fillings are toxic.\nIt was then, Reuters reported in June 2008, that the FDA settled a lawsuit with several consumer advocacy groups, including Consumers for Dental Choice and Moms Against Mercury. The group sought to ban mercury fillings from the U.S. market. As part of the settlement, according to Reuters, the FDA agreed to alert consumers about the potential risks on its website and to issue a more specific rule about fillings that contain mercury.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a notice on its website \u2014\u00a0and this is what the Principia Scientific story quotes \u2014\u00a0the FDA said that amalgams contain mercury, which may have neurotoxic effects on the nervous systems of developing children and fetuses.\n\"Pregnant women and persons who may have a health condition that makes them more sensitive to mercury exposure, including individuals with existing high levels of mercury microburden, should not avoid seeking dental care, but should discuss options with their health practitioner,\" the FDA said.\nAt the time, a lawyer for Consumers for Dental Choice described the FDA\u2019s statement as a major shift.\u00a0\n\"Gone, gone, gone are all of the FDA\u2019s claims that no science exists that amalgam is unsafe,\" he said.\nThe Associated Press, reporting on the settlement, said that \"silver dental fillings contain mercury, and the government for the first time is warning that they may pose a safety concern for pregnant women and young children.\" It described it as a victory for \"anti-mercury activists.\"\nBut the report also notes that the warning isn\u2019t aimed at everybody \u2014\u00a0just two groups of people who are already urged to limit mercury from seafood because too much can harm a developing brain.\nOur ruling\nThe story we\u2019re fact-checking claims that the FDA finally admitted that \"dental fillings are toxic.\"\nThat\u2019s not quite right, and it\u2019s old news \u2014\u00a0not from 2018, when the story was posted, but 2008, when the FDA settled a lawsuit with consumer groups. It\u2019s true that as part of the settlement the FDA warned that a type of dental filling, amalgams, may have neurotoxic effects on some people \u2014\u00a0pregnant women, fetuses and young children. But it didn\u2019t declare without caveats that dental fillings are toxic, full stop.\u00a0\nWe rate this story Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17653"}
