If you look at the polls \u2014 Todd, and you know this no matter what they say \u2014 you look at the polls, Hillary Clinton wins every time with Donald Trump.\"\nFor this fact-check, we'll look at whether Beck is accurately characterizing the national head-to-head polls.\nAs it turns out, he is.\nOur source is the compilation of national surveys by RealClearPolitics.com. Since a Fox News poll dating back to Feb. 15, Clinton has won every hypothetical head-to-head matchup with the billionaire.\nAnd in every case, the winning margin has been larger than the poll's margin of error.\nThe website\u2019s aggregation of the most recent polls gives Clinton a spread of 10.5 percentage points over Trump.\nThe trend has been clear for the past year.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you go back to polls released in May 2015 (before Trump was officially a candidate), Clinton has bested Trump in 51 of 58 matchups. In 43 of those surveys, she's outpolled Trump by a percentage that's greater than the margin of error.\nTrump has come out on top in only five\u00a0polls. The last time was in a February USA Today/Suffolk survey, where the two-point spread was within the margin of error. That poll has not been repeated.\nHis winning margin hasn't been greater than the margin of error since a November survey by Fox News. More importantly, Fox's two newest\u00a0polls, from February and March, both\u00a0show Clinton winning. The March survey gives her a winning margin of 11 percentage points.\nOne of those five polls, from early September, hasn't been repeated either.\nTwo other surveys released since May 2015 have had him tied with Clinton. The most recent was conducted in early October. But once again, the latest versions of those polls, by Public Policy Polling in late March and CNN/ORC in mid March, have Clinton way ahead.\nOur ruling\nThe bottom line is every recent poll shows Clinton clearly ahead of Trump. The only polls that favor Trump are old and have mostly been superseded by newer surveys showing that Clinton has pulled ahead.\nWe rate Beck's claim True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05130"}
