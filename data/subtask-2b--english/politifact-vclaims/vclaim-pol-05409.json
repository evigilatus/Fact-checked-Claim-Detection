Scott Walker.\nThen the ad turns quickly to Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Joe Donald, who is the third candidate in the Feb. 16, 2016 primary for Bradley\u2019s seat. The two candidates who get the most votes will face off in the April 5, 2016 general election.\n\"Joe Donald,\" the narrator says in Kloppenburg\u2019s ad, which was released Feb. 8, 2016, \"he supported Rebecca Bradley, Walker\u2019s choice, twice.\"\nAt the same time, these words are shown on the screen: \"Donald twice supported Walker appointee Bradley,\" with the quote attributed to a blog. \u00a0\nKloppenburg, who is running from the left, is associating Donald with the candidate who is clearly on the right.\nAs we\u2019ll see, Donald\u2019s support for Bradley was explicit for one judicial post, but split for another.\nThe candidates\nKloppenburg, of Madison, ran for the Supreme Court once before, in 2011. Then an assistant state attorney general, she lost to Justice David Prosser in a race so close it went to a recount. Kloppenburg won election to the Madison-based District 4 Court of Appeals in 2012.\nBradley, of the Milwaukee suburb of Wauwatosa, was appointed to the Supreme Court by Walker in October 2015 after the death of Justice Patrick Crooks, and is now running for the seat for the first time. Bradley had also been appointed by Walker to the Milwaukee-based District 1 Court of Appeals in May 2015 and before that to the Milwaukee County Circuit Court in 2012.\nDonald, of Milwaukee, was appointed to the Milwaukee County bench in 1996 by GOP Gov. Tommy Thompson and has won election to the court four times, without opposition. He is also running for the high court for the first time. The Milwaukee County court is the link between Bradley and Donald.\nGiven her incumbency and her position on the ideological scale, Bradley is expected to advance to the general election, which means the real race in the primary is between Kloppenburg and Donald.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin LeMahieu\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a TV interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It takes quite a while on Election Day to load those ballots, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKloppenburg\u2019s evidence\nOn Kloppenburg\u2019s claim that Donald twice supported Bradley, let\u2019s look at the instances cited by Kloppenburg\u2019s campaign. Both were first reported by WisPolitics.com.\n1. Donald specifically endorsed Bradley in 2013 in her first run for the Milwaukee County Circuit Court. She had been appointed the year before by Walker to the seat, and defeated two challengers in the election.\nIt is common for sitting judges to support one another in elections, something Donald\u2019s campaign itself has said in explaining Donald\u2019s backing of Bradley.\nDonald, though, has also said he got \"bamboozled,\" telling WisPolitics: \"I really thought (Bradley) was about being a trial court judge. It became apparent that it had nothing to do with it, that this was clearly a process to put her in place to put her on the Supreme Court.\"\n2. Donald gave his name as a reference when Bradley applied to fill the 2015 vacancy on the state appeals court -- but he also recommended that Walker choose another candidate.\nBradley\u2019s application letter to Walker lists Donald as one of four references, noting that Donald had previously served as presiding judge of the Milwaukee County Children\u2019s Court. Bradley served there after being appointed to the Milwaukee court by Walker.\nDonald\u2019s campaign acknowledges that Donald consented to Bradley listing him as a reference for her appeals court application. But the campaign also cites a letter Donald wrote to Walker in which Donald recommended that Walker choose Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Timothy Dugan for the slot.\nSo, in contrast to the first instance, when Donald\u2019s support for Bradley was unilateral, his support in the second instance was split.\nOur rating\nKloppenburg says Donald twice \"supported\" Bradley.\nDonald explicitly endorsed Bradley in a 2013 election for the Milwaukee County Circuit Court. When there was a vacancy on the state appeals court in 2015, Donald supported Bradley by allowing her to use him as a reference in her application, although he also recommended that the governor choose a different applicant for the post.\nFor a statement that is accurate but needs additional information, our rating is Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05409"}
