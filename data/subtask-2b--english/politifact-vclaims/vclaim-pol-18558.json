But former U.S. Rep. Ron Paul declared that Biden\u2019s plans also include a nationwide lockdown, despite recent statements from Biden and his team that it\u2019s not his preferred plan.\u00a0\nIn a Nov. 5 Tweet that became a viral Instagram post, Paul said, \"20 million Americans are collecting unemployment, and Biden wants a nationwide lockdown to combat a virus that has a 99%+ survival rate?\"\u00a0\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nPaul is a libertarian and former physician who represented a Houston-area district in Congress. His tweet mostly gets the numbers right regarding unemployment aid and the COVID-19 survival rate, with the caveat that the survival rate does not include\u00a0those over age 70. But for this check, we focus on the claim about Biden\u2019s view on a national lockdown similar to the stay-at-home orders and business closures that many local and state governments have enacted.\nRecent statements from Biden and his advisers have created some confusion about his position on a U.S. lockdown:\u00a0\n\n\nIn an August interview with ABC\u2019s David Muir, Biden was asked whether he would shut the country down to stop the spread of COVID-19 if scientists recommended it. Biden said, \"I would shut it down; I would listen to the scientists.\"\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nIn early September, Biden said, \"There's going to be no need, in my view, to be able to shut down the whole economy. I got asked by David Muir a question, if I was asked to shut everything down. I took that as a generic question if \u2014 \u2018Am I going to follow the science?\u2019\"\n\n\nOn Oct. 31, Biden tweeted: \"I'm not going to shut down the country. I'm not going to shut down the economy. I'm going to shut down the virus.\"\n\n\nOn Nov. 12, as cases began surging nationwide, Michael Osterholm, a member of Biden\u2019s newly formed COVID-19 task force, said he believed locking down the country for four to six weeks could help to slow the spread. Osterholm later clarified that his comments did not represent the views of Biden\u2019s advisory team and had not been vetted by them.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter Osterholm\u2019s clarification, a Biden transition official said Nov. 13 that a shutdown \"is not in line with the president-elect\u2019s thinking,\" according to NBC News.\n\n\nThe same day, Dr. Celine Gounder, another member of Biden\u2019s COVID-19 task force, said that it is \"not the opinion\" of the group to enact a nationwide lockdown, according to CNBC. She said the task force would prefer a geographically targeted approach to closures and shutdowns.\u00a0\n\n\nMisinformation also muddied the waters: Viral posts circulated in October that falsely claimed Biden pledged to lock down the nation until a vaccine is available. Reuters and other fact-checkers found no evidence that Biden said that.\nDaniel McAdams, executive director of the Ron Paul Institute for Peace and Prosperity, said the basis for Paul\u2019s tweet was Biden\u2019s response to Muir in the August ABC interview, when Biden said, \"I would shut it down; I would listen to the scientists.\"\nBut Biden qualified his answer by saying he would take the advice of scientists \u2014 he did not explicitly say in that interview that he \"wanted\" a shutdown, as Paul claimed. And by the time of Paul\u2019s Nov. 15 tweet, Biden and his advisers had provided more context on their current views about a national lockdown.\nBiden\u2019s most definitive statement came on Nov. 19, a few days after Paul\u2019s claim. \"I am not going to shut down the economy, period,\" he said in a news conference after a meeting with governors. \"I\u2019m going to shut down the virus, that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to shut down. I\u2019ll say it again: No national shutdown. No national shutdown. Because every region, every area, every community can be different. And so there\u2019s no circumstance which I can see that would require a total national shutdown. I think that would be counterproductive.\"\nOur ruling\nIn a tweet that became a viral Instagram post, Paul said, \"Biden wants a nationwide lockdown to combat a virus that has a 99%+ survival rate?\"\u00a0\nPaul\u2019s post mischaracterized Biden\u2019s position at that time, and Biden has further clarified it since.\nBiden said in August that he would support a national lockdown if scientists determined it was necessary to curb the disease.\u00a0\nIn October, he said he would not shut down the country or economy. And after the election \u2014\u00a0 before Paul made his claim \u2014 Biden and members of his COVID-19 task force indicated again that a nationwide shutdown is not part of their plans. Biden has come out even more forcefully against the prospect of a nationwide shutdown since Paul published his tweet.\u00a0\nWhile Biden\u2019s earlier comments suggest he is open to seeking a lockdown if it\u2019s warranted, he and his team have made it clear that they neither intend nor want to impose a national shutdown, as Paul claims.\u00a0\nWe rate this claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18558"}
