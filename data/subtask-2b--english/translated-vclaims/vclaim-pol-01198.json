The registrations are legitimate, and the United States Border Patrol denounced the actions that occurred in January when they first became viral. The one-minute and 30-second video contains footage of border patrol officers kicking and emptying in ground bottles of water gallons. The time seals of some videos indicate that they were recorded in 2011 and 2013. The group behind the videos also said it contained footage from 2017. \"The U.S. border agents observed the sabotage of supplies left to the immigrants,\" he said, provided for footage of the gallons of water kick agents left on the ground.
