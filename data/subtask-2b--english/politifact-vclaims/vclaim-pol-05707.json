By letting refugees into our country without vetting we are putting America at risk,\" Republican candidate Ben Carson wrote in an official statement posted on Facebook on Nov. 16.\nIs Carson right that we don\u2019t vet the refugees? Well, it\u2019s more that we can\u2019t, Carson spokesperson Doug Watts told us.\n\"There is no foolproof and effective way of vetting these people,\" Watts said. \"That\u2019s his opinion, shared by millions of others, and confirmed by thousands of felonies occurring at the hands of both legal and illegal immigrants.\"\nBut Carson said we don\u2019t vet refugees, and that isn\u2019t correct. Carson has a point that the system isn\u2019t foolproof, but the ability to screen refugees does exist.\nHow we vet refugees\nLet\u2019s begin with an overview of the refugee admissions process, which has been in place since 1980 and was retooled after 9/11.\nBefore refugees even face U.S. vetting, they must first clear an eligibility hurdle. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees \u2014 or occasionally a U.S. embassy or another NGO \u2014 determines who counts as a refugee, who should be resettled (about 1 percent) and which countries would take them. This can take four to 10 months.\nOnce the cases are referred to the United States, refugees are vetted through a process that involves multiple federal intelligence and security agencies. Typically, about half of refugees are approved, according to the State Department.\nRefugees undergo several rounds of security clearance checks. Their names, biographical information and fingerprints are run through databases coordinated by the FBI, the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Defense.\nFor Syrian refugees, there\u2019s one additional step. Their filings with the UN and initial documents submitted to the U.S. program are reviewed. Information about where they came from, what caused them to flee and what their experiences were like are cross-referenced with classified and unclassified information.\nAccording to Buzzfeed, Syrian refugees are also being vetted through a secret national security screening program. The program, the Controlled Application Review and Resolution Process, is specifically used to screen people deemed potential national security threats.\nWhile the checks are being conducted, trained DHS officers interview refugees in person. (Most interviews with Syrian refugees happen in Amman, Istanbul and Cairo.) Refugees who\u2019ve been cleared by the officer, the State Department and the background checks then undergo medical screenings, a\u00a0match with a sponsor agency, \"cultural orientation\" classes and one final security clearance.\nThis process typically takes one to two years, if not longer, and happens before a refugee ever gets onto American soil.\nGaps and challenges\nThere are undoubtedly challenges to vetting refugees, with intelligence and national security officials highlighting the paucity of data in particular.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe head of the National Counterterrorism Center told Congress in October that the intelligence in Syria is \"not as rich as we would like it to be,\" while FBI Director James Comey told Congress that there are \"gaps\" in data availability.\n\"If someone has never made a ripple in the pond in Syria in a way that would get their identity or their interest reflected in our database, we can query our database until the cows come home, but there will be nothing show up because we have no record of them,\" Comey said in a House Committee on Homeland Security hearing on Oct. 21.\nThe lack of U.S. relationships with Syrian government and law enforcement and the use of fake passports and fraudulent documents are also causes for concern, according to Jessica Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Studies, which describes itself as \"low immigration, pro-immigrant.\"\n\"The country is in chaos and the identities and claims of the applicants are nearly impossible to verify. We can check our databases and fingerprint repositories, and so on, but if we have collected little information on Syrians, it will not help,\" Vaughan said\nThe case against alarm\nChallenges, however, don\u2019t translate into \"no ability\" to vet at all.\n\"No system is foolproof. If we really wanted a foolproof system, we would shut down immigration entirely,\" said David Martin, a University of Virginia professor who\u2019s previously held posts at DHS and the State Department. \"The alarm is way overblown.\"\nExperts and advocates pushed back on the notion that we accept refugees with no intelligence at all. In contrast to refugees worldwide, Syrians tend to have identity documents and the reasons they give for missing documents (i.e. a barrel bomb dropping on their house) can be verified, according to the State Department.\nThere\u2019s no real precedent of a terrorist slipping in through the U.S. refugee system. The concerns stemming from the Syrian passport found in connection to the Paris attacks don\u2019t apply here, experts said. That\u2019s because the European vetting process for refugees arriving by sea is extremely chaotic and not comparable to the processes used by the UN and United States.\nIn the United States, very few resettled refugees \u2014 three since 9/11, according to the Washington Post\u00a0Fact\u00a0Checker \u2014 have been implicated in terrorist situations. Daryl Grisgraber of Refugees International pointed out that the Tsarnaevs came to the United States as children from Chechnya and applied for asylum, but were radicalized here.\n\"We\u2019ve also resettled thousands in recent years from the Central African Republic, Somalia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, all of which have faced similar terrorist threats and have unstable governments that present challenges for the vetting process. But we\u2019ve done this successfully time and time again without incident,\" said Geoffrey Mock, the Syrian country specialist for Amnesty International USA.\nAnd finally, refugees are subject to the highest level of security checks of any category of traveler to the United States. So for ISIS to take advantage of the refugee program \"makes no operational sense,\" said Anne Speckhard, a counterterrorism expert at Georgetown University. It would be more likely for ISIS to find Europeans who could travel to the United States on business or tourist visas.\n\"Given how easy it is to send a European extremist to the U.S. via Europe, why would an ISIS guy in Syria wait the three years it takes to get refugee status?\" she said.\nOur ruling\nCarson said, \"There is currently no ability to vet these people,\" referring to Syrian refugees.\nThe United States vets refugees through a process that involves multiple federal and international groups and that typically takes one to two years. Refugees undergo security checks, interviews, medical screenings and other steps.\nCarson has a point that there is some concern over insufficient data, though some say the concern is exaggerated. Even if there are gaps and challenges in the vetting process, it\u2019s a far cry to say there\u2019s no ability at all to vet refugees.\nWe rate Carson\u2019s claim Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05707"}
