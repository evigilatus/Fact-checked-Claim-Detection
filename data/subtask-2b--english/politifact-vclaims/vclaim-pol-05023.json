Sanders of Vermont won an upset victory in the party\u2019s Michigan presidential primary.\nClinton leveled a similar claim about Sanders and the Minutemen at a Democratic debate in Miami the next day; PolitiFact found her statement Mostly True. Unlike Castro, she did not call the Minuteman Project a hate group.\nDemocrats tend to support comprehensive immigration reform including possible citizenship for residents living in the country without legal permission. Sanders, an Independent, caucused with Democrats in the House and later in the Senate. So it\u2019s arguably not helpful at the polls for him to be seen as supporting the Minuteman Project, which came into the spotlight in 2005 when its founders organized a volunteer stakeout of parts of the Arizona-Mexico border for the month of April.\nOne of the co-founders of the Minuteman Project, Chris Simcox, parted ways with the project and established the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps in 2005. The remaining founder, Jim Gilchrist, was fired from the Minuteman Project in 2007, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. \nThe groups spawned a network of chapters over the years, driven by a combination of growth and internal conflict over finances and other issues. Some chapters were not close to the border and focused on anti-immigration advocacy, while others voluntarily patrolled the U.S.-side of the border with Mexico.\nThose patrols and confrontation with undocumented immigrants prompted then-President George W. Bush to disparage them as \"vigilantes\" \u00a0and a former Mexican president to call them \"immigrant hunters,\" the Washington Post reported in 2005.\nBut the Minuteman Project and Minuteman Civil Defense Corps websites in 2005 and 2006 explicitly described their cause as \"peaceful\" and urged members to follow the letter of the law while patrolling the border, or risk discrediting their cause.\nIn the claim, Castro, like Clinton, was referencing a vote on an amendment to a 2006 appropriations bill. The amendment was proposed by Rep. Jack Kingston of Georgia in response to rumors that the U.S. Border Patrol had been telling the Mexican government where vigilante civilian border groups were stationed.\nThe 2006 CQ Almanac described it as follows: \"Kingston, R-Ga., amendment that would bar the use of funds in the bill to provide a foreign government with information that relates to the operations or location of the Minutemen or other private volunteer border patrol groups along the U.S.-Mexican border, unless the information sharing is required by an international treaty.\"\nOn the House floor, Kingston explained, \"What this amendment does is it clarifies Congress' position on a Border Patrol practice or a practice of the U.S. Government that tips off illegal immigrants as to where citizen patrols may be located. ... What my amendment does is simply says that the U.S. Government cannot tip off the Mexican officials as to where these folks are located.\"\nAt the time, Rep. Martin Olav Sabo, D-Minn., said he didn\u2019t oppose it because it essentially restated existing Customs and Border Patrol policy.\nPolitiFact found that Clinton got Sanders\u2019 vote right \u2014 he did vote with the GOP for the amendment, House records show \u2014 but downplayed what had been a bipartisan vote where 76 Democrats joined 216 Republicans in support.\nBut unlike Clinton, Castro described the Minuteman Project as \"a hate group.\"\nSo, is the Minuteman Project a hate group \u2014 and did Sanders\u2019 vote really protect them?\nRequests for clarification from Castro led to Josh Schwerin, a spokesman for the Clinton campaign, reaching out via email and directing us to the Southern Poverty Law Center\u2019s list of nativist extremist groups. \u00a0The SPLC was established in 1971 and is listed as an outreach partner by the FBI, according to the agency\u2019s website.\nThe SPLC list doesn\u2019t designate the Minuteman Project a hate group, unlike some other groups on their list of nativist extremists, which are marked with an asterisk to denote that they are both nativist extremist and hate groups.\nWe wondered what moves a group into hate-group territory. By phone, Mark Potok, a center expert, told us \"the nativist extremist groups are a step towards the center.\"\n\"Basically, those are the groups which go beyond merely disagreeing with immigration policy and confront, personally, suspected illegal immigrants, or people who would help or hire them,\" he said, adding: \"We don't list a group just for saying they think immigration levels ought to be lower.\"\nPotok continued, \"the thing to understand about our hate group listing is it's not based on criminality or violence. It\u2019s based on the ideology expressed by the group, on its website or by its leaders. We ask, does it demonize an entire group? Those are the hardest line groups we cover.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe SPLC\u2019s website defines hate groups as those that \"have beliefs or practices that attack or malign an entire class of people, typically for their immutable characteristics.\"\nPotok said that in 2006, the year the vote Castro referenced took place, nativist extremist groups were on the rise after beginning to emerge around 2005. Activity peaked in 2010, he said, when the center tallied 319 groups. In 2015, the SPLC counted only 17 such groups.\n\"A lot of these [extremist nativist groups] were spinoffs of the Minutemen groups,\" Potok said, \"but not all.\"\nBrian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, said in a phone interview that Jim Gilchrist, one of the co-founders of the Minuteman Project, was receptive when Levin approached him to deal with neo-Nazi elements in the organization, and that differences of opinion on how to handle that issue contributed to the fissure creating the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps.\n\"Certainly there were entities in the border movement that were clearly racist hate groups, and certainly there were people who were in the Minuteman Project at the time who were, but I can tell you that [Jim] Gilchrist wanted those people excluded, and after I informed him, he took measures to do,\" he said.\nIn our research, we found that coverage of the project\u2019s offshoots has been dominated by several high-profile criminal cases that happened in the years between 2006 and today. In 2009, a former member of the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps murdered a Latino man and his 9-year-old daughter after breaking into their home, CNN reported. In 2013, Minuteman Project and Minuteman Civil Defense Corps co-founder Chris Simcox was arrested for child sexual molestation, according to Univision. These incidents have taken a toll on the reputation of the groups (for instance, in 2010, the NAACP referred to the Minuteman Project as \"a nativist organization that has in the past been associated with the murder of migrant Mexican workers as part of its vigilante \"border operations\").\nBut it doesn't make sense to judge Sanders\u2019 House vote on incidents that came after it occurred.\nSo what information on the project was available at the time of the vote?\nA report from the Congressional Research Service, dated April 7, 2006, cited many potential problems that could arise with civilian border patrols, but also said that \"apart from the widely reported incident involving Ranch Rescue [an extremist anti-immigration group that dressed in military gear and went looking for armed drug smugglers in 2002], there have been no credible reports of civilian border patrol organizations engaging in violence against migrants.\"\nSome scholars of the Minuteman Project, like Leo Chavez, an anthropologist at UC Irvine who has written about the group, have suggested that press coverage and creating a spectacle were central to the group\u2019s purpose (\"Although monitoring the U.S.- Mexico border was Gilchrist\u2019s immediate objective, the larger goal was to use the \"citizen patrols\" on the border to draw attention to Gilchrist\u2019s larger aim of influencing public opinion and federal immigration policy,\" he wrote).\nChristopher J. Walker, an associate professor of law at Ohio State\u2019s Moritz College of Law, echoed this view in an article in the Harvard Latino Law Review, writing, \"More than anything else, the Minutemen seek media attention.\"\nTodd Gutnick, communications director for the Anti-Defamation League, told us by email, \"We have always referred to the Minutemen Project (of that period) as anti-immigrant extremists, who had racists/haters in their rank and file, but not specifically a hate group,\" when asked about the ADL\u2019s view of the Project circa 2006.\nSanders campaign policy director Warren Gunnels told us by email that Sanders \"did not vote to protect the minuteman. This amendment simply stated what was already law at that time. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has never shared information with the Mexican government except when required by treaty.\"\nAlthough Sabo said it didn\u2019t reflect a change in existing law, 106 out of 201 Democrats at the time still voted against it; 19 did not vote.\nWe reached out to Kingston for his perspective on the amendment.\n\"It wasn\u2019t an extremist group, they weren\u2019t violent, they weren\u2019t making threats, it wasn\u2019t anything like that at all,\" he said by phone. \"It passed overwhelmingly. I may have spoken to Bernie about it at the time, I don\u2019t remember, but it wasn\u2019t an extremist position. To me, it was common sense.\"\n\"It was a minor vote. I\u2019ve gotten calls from a few other reporters that started a few months ago. I didn\u2019t even remember the thing itself until they started asking me about it,\" he said.\nOur attempts to reach the Minuteman Project by phone and via its website proved unsuccessful.\nOur ruling\nCastro, a surrogate for the Clinton campaign, said: \"Bernie Sanders voted with Republicans to protect the Minutemen, a hate group that used military tactics against our community.\"\nSanders, then an Independent in the House, voted with 75 Democrats to restrict the U.S. from alerting Mexico to Minutemen operations on the border. However, we didn\u2019t see any evidence that this since-weakened extremist group was designated a \"hate group.\"\nOn balance, we rate this claim as Half True.\n\nHALF TRUE \u2013 The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05023"}
