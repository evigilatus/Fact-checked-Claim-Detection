On Facebook, one of them targets President Obama in particular, questioning his assistance - or his lack of assistance - in obstructing democratic candidates. The post of November 7 was shared more than 2,500 times and claims that \"each candidate\" is the campaign of the former president to lose their races in the elections. This article was referred to as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) While we have found that many of the candidates supported by Obama on the electoral campaign course have already lost, they certainly were not all. Obama supported more than 300 democratic candidates in Federation and State races throughout the country, according to national public radio. Because the Facebook article specifically says \"Possible,\" those are the races on which we're going to focus. From what we found, the former President travelled around the United States and campaigned for dozens of candidates. While some suffered losses, many also achieved victories; such as Jackie Rosen, who won a seat in the Nevada Senate; and Tony Evers, who won Governor in Wisconsin and Sin Tim Kane, who won a re-election in Virginia. The article quotes and quotes an opinion story from the Washington examiner. However, nowhere in this story does he say that \"all\" candidates Obama swinged to waste. But he highlighted three: Andrew Gillum, C. Bill Nelson, Stacey Abrams. Facebook was published on January 11, 2021 in Facebook, Nancy Belusi, who was no longer President of the House of Representatives by Samantha Buterman on January 12, 2021, but even those losses are far from stone. We'll explain. In Florida, a state known for the margins of the razor elections, several recounts are under way, including for Gillum and Nelson. On election night, Gillum was tracking Republican Ron Desantes in the run for governor with 7777 votes when he called Desantes to congratulate him. But the votes were still counted. Similarly, Nelson, the Democratic Governor, has been following the Republican Government. Rick Scott was on a small margin when Scott declared victory after midnight. Once again, the votes were still counted. By Friday, November 10, with the results of the recent informal elections from all Florida, the democratic candidates in both races were very little behind: Desantes was driving Gillum at 0.41 per cent, or 33,684 votes; Scott was driving Nelson in the Senate race at 0.15 per cent, or 12.562 votes. This was when Florida Secretary of State Ken Dietzner ordered a state-wide machine to re-screen more than 8.2 million race ballots in three races, including the United States Senate and Governor. The Florida Act requires automatic recounting in any race where the margin of victory is within half a percentage point. In Georgia, it's not very close, but the Democratic Governor's candidate Stacey Abrams doesn't admit it. The Republican competitor Brian Kemp, who had been Georgia's Foreign Minister for eight years prior to last week's election, resigned from his post as the superintendent of the state elections in November 8, two days after election day, when it became clear that his margin of victory might be small enough to force him into the final round. By Monday night, unofficial returns showed that Kemp was driving around 58,000 votes. However, questions about the State &apos; s handling of the provisional ballot and the voter registration system led a federal judge to issue an order for delays in the certification of the results until officials formally reviewed those issues. Our position in Facebook claims that every Obama candidate defeated the election campaign that took place on Tuesday. This is clearly wrong. Obama gathered democratic candidates who ended up losing, but the same applies to many others who were supported by those who won their races. We value this allegation wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01264"}
