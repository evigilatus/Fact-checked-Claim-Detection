The commission approved the resolution 6-0 at its June 2 meeting. The state will decide June 22 whether to allow another hunt.\nSome opponents of the measure had spoken in favor of a bear hunt. Phil Walters of GatorGuides.com said Hillsborough County didn\u2019t need to pass the resolution, because the county didn\u2019t even have a black bear population. But commissioners ran that risk if there was no bear hunt.\n\"Do you really want bears being brought into this county?\" Walters asked. \"If you think you\u2019ve got problems with wildlife now, wait until you have a top apex predator in close proximity to people.\"\nWhite later responded by saying Walters had mischaracterized bears as apex predators \u2014 meaning they are at the very top of the food chain.\n\"One of the folks that spoke during the public comment portion of the meeting called the Florida black bear a top apex predator. That is absolutely, unequivocally false,\" White said. He followed up with Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (or FWC) statistics that said a black bear\u2019s diet \"usually consists of 80 percent plants, 15 percent insects and 5 percent animal matter.\"\nWhite told PolitiFact Florida he meant apex predator in the figurative sense, to refute what he saw as Walters\u2019 implication that bears may hunt down\u00a0humans. Bears \"certainly don\u2019t actively hunt animal prey,\" White told us.\nHe has a point there, bear experts said, but using the term \"apex predator\" largely depends on how it\u2019s being applied.\nBear complexities\nFlorida\u2019s black bear population had dwindled to 300 some four decades ago before the species was protected and hunting was outlawed. In 2012, the FWC removed bears from the \"threatened\" list as their numbers rebounded. Recent estimates say there are about 4,350 bears statewide today.\nAs more people moved into bear habitat, the state fielded thousands of complaints about them hanging out in hot tubs, swinging in hammocks and raiding garbage bins. Then, beginning in 2013, bears attacked and mauled four women. That led to a decision in 2015 to schedule the first hunt in 21 years as a way to control the population. \u00a0A 320-bear limit was set for the weeklong hunt, but the state shut it down after just two days when permitted hunters had killed 304 bears.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong the reasons bears venture into populated areas (beyond loss of habitat and increased numbers) is that bears are omnivores, and will eat just about anything they can find \u2014 including what\u2019s in humans\u2019 garbage cans, barbecue grills and pet-food dishes. \u00a0\nTheir diet mostly includes berries, acorns, grasses, seeds, plant shoots, and even moss and ferns. If they do eat other animals, many times they are of the six-legged variety, such as ants, wasps and beetles. If a bear digs into a beehive, chances are they want the bees and not their honey.\nBears also will eat the odd armadillo or possum, but often those are scavenged from already dead carcasses. Playing dead is not a safe way to avoid being eaten by a bear.\n\"Bears definitely are carnivores and predators. Whether they are a \u2018top predator\u2019 is open to one\u2019s perspective,\" said Thomas Eason, the FWC\u2019s director of wildlife and habitat conservation. \"That connotation is not commonly used in the scientific arena for black bears.\"\nThat leads to an interesting juxtaposition: Bears are, by the standard definition, apex predators. They\u2019re at the top of the food chain, and practically nothing can or would even try to kill an adult bear for food. But how you use the term apex predator matters, too.\n\"If you are thinking about apex predators being a danger to people that they might see as food, as a polar bear might, then black bears are not a big issue,\" University of Florida wildlife biologist Bill Giuliano said. \"However, their omnivorous tendencies and ability to live in close proximity to people is a concern.\"\nBears don\u2019t look to hunt people down, as the term apex predator may evoke, but events can potentially turn sour quickly if they are around people. If bears, especially a sow with cubs, get startled or cornered (perhaps by a dog you\u2019ve let out of the house), they will try to escape. That escape route may be through you.\nIn that case, we asked, what could kill a 300-pound adult black bear, short of hitting it with a car?\n\"Nothing besides a bullet,\" Giuliano said.\nOur ruling\nWhite said\u00a0it's not true that Florida black bears are an \"apex predator.\"\nThat\u2019s overstating the case a little bit. Experts said bears are apex predators in the sense that nothing in their ecosystem naturally hunts them for food. Bears are definitely capable of injuring or even killing someone, but they don\u2019t normally seek out humans. Bears are omnivorous, and any interaction between hungry bears and people most often involves the bear getting caught rooting in the trash.\nWe rate White\u2019s statement Half True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/0629247b-6fb8-4941-9dbc-c3e878da71d4", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04858"}
