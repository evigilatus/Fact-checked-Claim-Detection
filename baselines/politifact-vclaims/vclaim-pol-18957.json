Chrissy Houlahan, D-Pa., asks during a hearing of a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee, \"Should you wear a mask if you\u2019re healthy?\"\nRedfield pushes the microphone toward his face and says, \"No.\"\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

In reality, this exchange happened in February 2020. You can hear it about 56 minutes and 30 seconds into the hearing on the country\u2019s coronavirus response.\nThis was before President Donald Trump declared COVID-19 a national emergency, and before the CDC changed its recommendations to encourage nearly everyone to wear a face covering when out in public and when social distancing is difficult.\u00a0\nEarly in the coronavirus outbreak, the CDC did discourage people from wearing face masks unless they had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. But that changed on April 3, when the CDC said it was revising its guidance based on continuing studies that found the virus could be transmitted by people who were asymptomatic.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 25, 2021 in a blog post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWHO now saying you do not need to wear a mask.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CDC\u2019s website now says that everyone 2 years of age and older should wear a mask in public and when around people who don\u2019t live in your household, especially when it\u2019s hard to physically distance.\nOn July 14, the CDC released a news release calling on \"Americans to wear masks to prevent COVID-19 spread.\"\u00a0\n\"All Americans have a responsibility to protect themselves, their families, and their communities,\" the release said.\u00a0\nRedfield was the co-author of an editorial that was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. It was titled, \"Universal masking to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission\u2014the time is now,\" and made the case that \"broad adoption of cloth face coverings is a civic duty, a small sacrifice reliant on highly effective low-tech solutions that can help turn the tide favorably in national and global efforts against COVID-19.\"\u00a0\nOur ruling\nWhile Redfield did say in February that healthy people should not wear masks, the CDC reversed course months ago and since early April has recommended that healthy people wear face coverings.\nThis Instagram post wrongly frames his comments from February as if he currently believes that healthy people shouldn\u2019t wear masks.\u00a0\nThis was published online the same day that Redfield said masks are the most effective tool Americans have in the fight against COVID-19 \u2014 muddying the waters for people seeking clear, current information.\u00a0\nRedfield says that healthy people should wear face coverings.\u00a0\nWe rate this Instagram post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18957"}
