Hays County, which sits to the south of Austin, has been hit particularly hard.\nOn June 19, the county reported more active cases than Austin\u2019s Travis County \u2014 a remarkable feat considering that Travis County\u2019s population is five times that of Hays County.\nU.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, a Democrat whose district includes parts of both counties, shared two tweets about the Austin area, including one highlighting the impact of the virus in Hays County.\n\"Hays County is one of the only places in Texas with more trouble: an incredible 845% increase in cases since June 7,\" he wrote.\nThere\u2019s no question Hays County has experienced a dramatic increase in the number of COVID-19 cases, but is Doggett\u2019s figure accurate?\u00a0\nHays County increase tied to activities\nIn response to a question from PolitiFact Texas, Hays County spokeswoman Kim Hilsenbeck shared a press release outlining the impact of the coronavirus in the county since the onset of the pandemic.\nDuring April and early May \u2014\u00a0when local and statewide orders to stay at home were in place \u2014\u00a0the number of new daily cases in the county ranged from zero to ten.\nIn late April, Gov. Greg Abbott initiated the first phase of a plan to reopen the state\u2019s economy and allowed the statewide stay-at-home order to expire. He also allowed restaurants, retail stores, malls and movie theaters to reopen at limited capacity.\nIn subsequent phases, Abbott allowed barbershops and salons to reopen with limited capacity and other restrictions. He also allowed rivers, parks and other natural areas to reopen.\u00a0\nCounty health officials said they believe the gradual reopening of businesses might have contributed to an increase in COVID-19 cases.\u00a0\n\"Through contact tracing, our health department staff were able to see the rapid increase in COVID-19 totals seemed to coincide with activities such as working at or going to restaurants and bars, activities such as floating the river, and attending large public gatherings,\" the release reads.\u00a0\nHilsenbeck also highlighted Mothers Day (May 10), Memorial Day (May 25) and protests against racism and police brutality as significant events in May.\nBy the end of May and early June, the number of new cases in the county started to rise. On May 27 there were 18 new cases. On June 8, there were 43 new cases.\u00a0\nMore recently, the number of new daily cases in Hays County has ranged from 100 to 200.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn April and May, the majority of new cases in the county were primarily in Kyle among people older than 30 who were Hispanic.\u00a0\nBut since early June, the group experiencing the largest increase in new COVID-19 cases is 20 to 29-year-olds in San Marcos. The number of people who identified as Hispanic has decreased.\n\"While not all 20-29-year-olds are college students, San Marcos has a large student population because of Texas State University, many of whom are now back in town following a period of virtual learning throughout the spring,\" the release reads.\nExamining data on new cases\nDoggett spokeswoman Kate Stotesbery said the figure he shared came from a graph published by an Austin-area television station.\u00a0\nThe graph shows the number of new coronavirus cases that have been reported each day in Hays County since April, plus a line showing the 14-day average of daily new cases.\nAn arrow pointing upwards is overlaid on the graphic, with text on top that reads: \"845% 14-day average since June 7.\"\nBut Doggett\u2019s remark on Twitter is missing that detail \u2014 that there has been an 845% increase in the 14-day average of new COVID-19 cases in the county since June 7. The increase in the actual number of cases is much higher.\nOn June 7, the cumulative number of cases in the county was 385 and the number of new daily cases had been fluctuating. There were 24 new cases on June 2, 14 new cases on June 4 and zero new cases on June 7.\nBy June 21, the cumulative count of cases in Hays County was 1,608, with 57 new cases reported that day.\nLooking at the 14-day average of new cases, it was 8 on June 7 and 87 on June 21.\nBut the 7-day average is a more commonly used measurement by government agencies and news outlets to assess changes in the number of new cases in the area. The change in that figure during this period is substantially higher.\nUsing weekly averages instead of daily tallies offers a more accurate picture of change over time, as it reduces the impact of daily spikes.\nFrom June 7 to June 21, Hays County experienced a roughly 1,569% increase in the 7-day average of new COVID-19 cases \u2014 from 8 cases on June 7 to 134 on June 21.\nOur ruling\nDoggett said that Hays County had experienced \"an incredible 845% increase in cases since June 7.\"\nDoggett was actually speaking about an increase in the 14-day average of new COVID-19 cases \u2014 a less common measurement of the increase in COVID-19 cases in an area \u2014 but his figure is accurate.\u00a0\nWe rate this claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18002"}
