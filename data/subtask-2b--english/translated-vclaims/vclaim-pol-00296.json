Anyway, the growth business club, a conservative PAC, came after him for his work in the energy field in a new attack announcement. \"McCreedy was able to pay $450,000 to press for the energy systems of the state that benefited from McCreedy's own business. Then, McCreedy handed you the bill. The cost to the consumers here? 149 million dollars a year in higher energy costs,\" said the ad. According to Matthew Farid, MacCready's spokesman, the declaration's claim that solar energy had increased its rates was \"clearly false.\" When asked where the information was obtained for the announcement, the Growth Club referred to an article from the Washington examiner and echoed the allegations made in the announcement. Why are we investigating this? We are investigating allegations that are published or widely disseminated; they relate to a subject of interest to many of our readers; they can be proved or refuted by the facts; and they can induce people to act or vote in a particular way. This subject has met all the criteria. The Ninth Circle race of Congress will be imminent. Charlotte's surveillance report last week that multiple groups of GOP spent $4 million on commercial purchases against McCreedy. This means that the announcement of this growth club is one of the many announcements that will appear before the special elections of 10 September. In addition, electricity is an important expense for many households. The aim of the Growth Club announcement is to convince voters that McCready put pressure on him to develop his renewed business at their expense. Did McCreedy return to energy rules \"at cost \"? Before running for Congress, McCready was a co-founder of double capital, an investment company launched in 2013 focusing on solar farms in North Carolina. Because of his participation in sustainable energy, McCready was appointed to the Board of Directors of the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association for 2015-2016, which means that he served on the Board from January 2015 to December 2017. The amount of $450,000 may be misleading to voters, as it includes pressure on funds spent before McCready joins the Board of Directors of the National Council for Economic and Social Affairs. However, we decided to verify specifically from the most affected part of the Declaration that it supported legislation that would cost consumers money. The Declaration refers to \"cost government energy systems\" as the criterion for the renewable energy portfolio in North Carolina, which was established in 2007 eight years prior to the election of McCready to the NCSEA Council. It requires that all facilities owned by investors in North Carolina receive 12.5 per cent of their retail electricity sales from eligible renewable energy resources by 2021. In 2015, a bill in the Council of State, the House of Representatives Bill 760, would revise the standard to require only utilities to obtain 6 per cent of electricity from renewable energy resources. This legislation was passed by the House of Representatives but died in a Senate committee. A report issued in 2015 by the Office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs in North Carolina shows that the Authority spent $288,842.97 on lobbying that year. We could not find research that would show what could have been cost if HB 760 had become law. However, there are estimates of the cost of these standards more generally. Did the firm cost taxpayers $149 million a year? &apos; Washington &apos; s examiner quote a study by Utah State University and Strata Policy. The updated study in 2017 estimates the cost of residential electricity consumers at $149 million, or $34 per person, and an increase of 2.3 per cent in cost for residential consumers. Facebook published on January 27, 2021, in Facebook, says that Joe Biden canceled the Keystone pipeline because Warren Buffett \"doned $58 million\" for his campaign. \u2022 29 January 2021, left-wing groups challenged the credibility of this study. David Bomerants, Executive Director of the Institute for Energy and Liberal Policy, said that the study might be linked to the oil industry because of the University &apos; s funding from an oil mongol. The lead researcher, Randy Simmons, was a professor of political economics in Utah State from 2008 to 2013. He said that this was just one element of the study of \"fat defects.\" \"The main focus of the study's \"economic analysis\" is that it looked at how states that have enacted laws of social protection succeed before passing them as compared to how they succeed after passing them. This is a comfortable method (if you want a distorted result) that benefits from the fact that many states passed the RPS right around the beginning of the 2008 recession,\" Pomerantz said in an e-mail interview with News & Overview. We have looked into this issue and found that there are many different studies of programme implications, and their estimates of the total cost of the programme range from minor savings to cost increases. Laurie Benner, Professor of Energy Economics and Policy at Duke University, said that this was due to \"systematic challenges in isolating the impact of RPS on electricity costs.\" The National Renewable Energy Laboratory conducted a comprehensive study which concluded that the renewable energy system could lead to energy cost savings of up to 0.7 per cent or an increase in costs of up to 0.8 per cent. Peter Van Doren, a senior colleague at the Kato Institute and expert in housing, land, energy, environment, transport and labour regulation, referred to a study from the University of Chicago that estimated cost increases of 11-17 per cent of retail prices. The study estimated that the cost of pesticides could range from $115 to $530 per metric tonne of reduced CO2 emissions, which is much higher than estimated elsewhere. Of course, renewable standards also have benefits, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. However, the University of Chicago study stated that the Obama Administration estimates that climate change damage has a \"social cost\" of about $51 per tonne of CO2 emissions, which is far below the RPS cost calculation. A series of studies estimate that renewable energy standards increase electricity rates. The price increase is estimated from less than 1 per cent to 17 per cent of retail prices. However, the growth club announcement lacks the benefits of renewable energy, as Benjour said. The growth club announcement says McCreedy supports regulations that will cost consumers $149 million a year in their electric bills. While it was true that the clean energy package had been pushed to maintain the renewable portfolio standard in North Carolina, the standard had already been established for almost a decade at the time McCready joined the Panel &apos; s board of directors. It is misleading to say that NCSEA pressed for \"high state regulations\" when RSS was already in law for years before the House of Representatives passed legislation that would have mitigated it. The declaration gives an accurate figure of the costs of the standard, but the experts told us that estimates of the effects of the measures of protection against harm vary considerably, ranging from savings to costs. Furthermore, the Declaration does not mention that renewable energy reduces toxic and costly CO2 emissions. So, we're evaluating this statement mostly wrong. Correction: An earlier version of this story contained incorrect figures of the estimated cost of CO2 emissions and a study by the University of Chicago of the cost of renewable standards for each metric ton of reduced carbon emissions. This does not change our judgment. This story was produced by the North Carolina Fact Review Project, a partnership from Maclachi Carolina, Duke University Reporter Laboratory and Fact Politics.
