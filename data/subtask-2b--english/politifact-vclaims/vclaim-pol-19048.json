Some call for the same order to be given for other states.\nOne problem: The post is completely fictitious.\nIn fact, a ruling from a federal judge -- upheld by an appeals panel -- actually does the opposite. It extends the period for which absentee ballots can be counted by nearly a week.\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook).\nLet's look at this more closely.\nFor those in line, voting can continue after 8 p.m.\nThe first problem is that results have never been tallied by 8 p.m. on Election Day.\nThat\u2019s when polls close.\nAnd, by state law, anyone in line by 8 p.m. is entitled to vote. That alone might take hours in a high turnout election. So, as a practical matter, there is no way to count all of the votes by 8 p.m.\u00a0\nAbsentee ballots mean it will take longer\u00a0\nEven in pre-pandemic election years, when many fewer absentee ballots are involved, it can take hours to run all of the ballots through machines and get final numbers. That\u2019s because Wisconsin is among a few states that do not allow election clerks to begin that process until Election Day.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.

Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson recently called for it as well, but the GOP-controlled Legislature has refused to act.\nRuling says the opposite of the post\nThe Facebook post says a judge issued this ruling but provides no name.\nThat\u2019s because there is no such ruling.\nHistorically, state law has held that only absentee ballots received by Election Day can be tabulated. Those that come in later, even if mailed on time, are discarded.\nOn Sept. 21, 2020, a federal judge ordered a number of changes to procedures. Notably, for our purposes here, he gave Wisconsin voters more time to get their absentee ballots in. As long as the ballots are postmarked by Nov. 3, they can be accepted and counted by clerks through Nov. 9, nearly one week later.\nThat judge, William Conley, initially put that ruling on hold, so it could be appealed. On Sept 29, a panel of appeals court judges upheld the ruling, putting the extended deadline in place.\nThat ruling, which was unanimous, came from a three-judge panel of the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago, all of whom were appointed by Republican presidents.\nThe decision was a victory for Democrats, who asked to loosen election rules during the coronavirus pandemic and a setback for Republicans who tried to prevent changes to the timeline of Election Day.\u00a0\nThe ruling, which could be appealed again, also gave voters extra time to register to vote, extending the deadline from Oct. 14 to Oct. 21.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nThe Facebook post claims that a judge ruled all ballots in Wisconsin must be counted by 8 p.m. on Election Day.\nBut the post gets it completely wrong. First, voters in line at 8 p.m. on Election Day can legally cast their vote. No judge made this ruling.\u00a0\nAn earlier ruling from a federal judge -- since upheld by an appeals panel -- actually did the opposite, allowing any absentee ballots returned by Nov. 9 to be counted, as long as they were postmarked by Election Day.\nWe rate the claim Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19048"}
