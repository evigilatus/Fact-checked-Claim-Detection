The article shows a supposed clipping of newspapers and claims that Trump's 73-point IQ element was finally discovered - only two points away from the \"intellectual deficit\" and far below the average IQ of 100. The problem is that the story appears to have been made in order to disseminate misleading information: the images are false and none of its allegations are substantiated. The article was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The headline of the fake story says: \"The results of the IQ test found in the locker of the former NYMA employee. \"The results of the IQ test that President Donald Trump allegedly took during his first year at the New York Military Academy were discovered in a file box in a Brooklyn safe. According to test results, the IQ in Trump is 73. The article goes on to say that a man named William Eskio, Jr., discovered the files as he was cleaning up his deceased father's apartment. Skio explains that his father was a school counselor at the Military School from 1955 to 1985. Let's just get this out of the way: people have been guessing about presidential IQs for years, but we haven't found any record of presidential IQ being declared. Of course, many presidents died before the emergence of the new IQ test, the first versions of which were drafted in the early 19th century. Doesn't mean people didn't try to assign IQ numbers to key leaders. In 2006, a study by the psychologist Dean Keith Simonton at the University of California in Davis estimated that the sixth President of the United States, John Quincy Adams, had a brilliant intelligence level somewhere between 165 and 175. The study applied algorithms to presidential performance estimates of historians and political scientists, as well as presidential curriculum vitae, surveys and other sources. The Simonton Thomas Jefferson study was classified as the second smartest president with an average result ranging from 145 to 160. Kennedy ranked third with estimated results between 138-159. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" By Samantha Buterman: January 11, 2021 Trump, both before and after he became President Forty-Fifty, he was known for challenging people for intelligence tests, including bragging once that, in competition with former Secretary of State Rex Tellerson, the IQ in Trump would be higher. He also called himself \"a very stable genius.\" However, the news coverage of these presidential allegations has never led to an actual intelligence rate in Trump. In 2013, when Trump was asked on Twitter what his IQ was, he tweeted in his response, \"Upper, hole.\" Nothing in this viral image changes what we know (or don't know) about Trump's IQ. A counter-image examination of the supposed newspaper clipping showed no results. Similarly, we have not been able to find articles on the Internet or in the Nexis archive of legitimate news sources discussing the discovery of Trump's IQ. This is important, because if this story exists - that the President of the United States once received an IQ test of 73 - it will not only be easy to find it on the Internet, but it could have been repeated by media organizations around the world. Searching with zero results indicates that the mail is fabricated. What's more, the picture of William Asquiu Jr. - the man who claims to have discovered the test results in Brooklyn's closet - is actually a picture from the website of Adobe stock, which can be searched by the phrase \"an older man.\" And the picture of the man who is supposed to be Eskio's father actually pictured Mr. Lawrence W. Hanson, director of Grand Forks Central High School in North Dakota in the 1950s. Jack Seraphin, Vice-President of the Graduate Regiment of the New York Military Academy, attended school from 1962 to 1967, a period that overlapped with Tramp, a 1964 graduate. Seraphin told Bolivi Vakt that the claim was unfounded. \"It's a fake, NYMA didn't give intelligence tests and long-term counselor for 30 years, \"Asquio, wasn't there,\" Seraphin wrote in the e-mail. \"The only tests I remember were for admission to school, such as SAT, taken before application.\" Our judgment is a picture of what appears to be a newspaper clipping claiming that Trump had an IQ of 73, according to a test he did when he joined the New York Military Academy in the 1960s. This test never happened, the leader of the alumni association said, and the newspaper clipping doesn't exist outside M. Photos at the site of the persons involved in the discovery were also selected and misunderstood. This article is pants on fire!
