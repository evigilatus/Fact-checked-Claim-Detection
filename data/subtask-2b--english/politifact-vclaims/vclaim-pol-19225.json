(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\n(Screenshot from Facebook)\nWood was banned from Twitter in early January after he promoted the Capitol insurrection and false claims about the results of the 2020 presidential election. He has also promoted the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory; Wood\u2019s claims about \"little children being abused, molested, and sacrificed\" by \"leaders in our government\" were aired on the Patriotically Correct Radio Show before his appearance.\nWe\u2019ve previously fact-checked false statements from Wood about the 2020 election, as well as rumors about a military takeover of the federal government. So we wanted to take a look at this post, too.\nBiden is not an \"illegal president,\" and there is no evidence that the military is running the country.\nBiden\u2019s election was legal, and followed the process spelled out in Article II of the Constitution. All 50 states and the District of Columbia have certified their election results, which Congress finalized on Jan. 7. Biden won 306 electoral votes, while Trump won 232. Since Biden got more than 270 electoral votes, he is the rightful president.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiden was duly sworn into office Jan. 20, after which he and first lady Jill Biden moved into the White House. Trump gave a farewell speech the same day.\nThere is no credible evidence that voter fraud affected the election outcome. Here\u2019s how we know that:\n\n\nElection officials in every state have said there was no sign of significant fraud during the voting process.\u00a0\n\n\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency called the election \"the most secure in American history.\"\n\n\nThe Justice Department said it uncovered no evidence of widespread fraud.\n\n\nNot one of the lawsuits from Trump and his allies offered evidence that voter fraud affected the election outcome.\n\n\nBefore Inauguration Day, QAnon supporters said the military would take over the federal government instead of Biden becoming president. That did not come to pass, and the U.S. is not under a military dictatorship.\nWe reached out to Wood for a comment, but we haven\u2019t heard back.\nHis statement is inaccurate and ridiculous. We rate it Pants on Fire!\nRELATED: A note to our readers who think President Trump won", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19225"}
