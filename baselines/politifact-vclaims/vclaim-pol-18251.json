It has been shared more than 27,000 times.\n\n(Screenshot from One News Now)\nDespite being one of the most trusted coronavirus experts in the United States, Fauci has been the target of several conspiracy theories about his handling of the pandemic \u2014\u00a0particularly since he tempered expectations for hydroxychloroquine during a March press conference. So we wanted to check out this article, too.\nThere are several things wrong with the One News Now story.\u00a0\nFirst: The article relies on a 2005 study about the effect of chloroquine on Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, more commonly called SARS. Chloroquine is chemically similar to hydroxychloroquine, but it is a different drug and is primarily used to treat malaria. Both drugs pose risks for people with heart problems.\nThe One News Now story claims the journal that published the study is \"the official publication of Dr. Fauci\u2019s National Institutes of Health.\" That\u2019s inaccurate.\nWhile the 2005 study has been indexed by the NIH\u2019s National Library of Medicine, it was published in the peer-reviewed Virology Journal. The journal is produced by BioMed Central, a United Kingdom-based for-profit publisher. The study\u2019s authors worked for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Clinical Research Institute of Montreal, and the study was funded by grants from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.\nWe reached out to the NIH for more context, but we haven\u2019t heard back.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on February 2, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeniors around the world who died from COVID vaccine are being improperly listed as \u201cnatural causes.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond: The study does not suggest that hydroxychloroquine could be effective at treating or preventing COVID-19, as One News Now claims.\n\"HCQ functions as both a cure and a vaccine,\" the website wrote. \"In other words, it\u2019s a wonder drug for coronavirus.\"\nThis is inaccurate \u2014\u00a0there is no cure or vaccine for SARS or the novel coronavirus. While some studies have found that hydroxychloroquine could mitigate some of the symptoms associated with COVID-19, other research has found no such effect. With more than 50 studies in the works, as well as an NIH clinical trial, it\u2019s too soon to say whether the drug is a viable treatment for the coronavirus.\nThe 2005 study found that chloroquine \u2014\u00a0not hydroxychloroquine \u2014 was \"effective in inhibiting the infection and spread of SARS CoV,\" the official name for SARS. The research was conducted in \"cell culture conditions,\" meaning the drug was not administered to actual SARS patients. The authors wrote that more research was needed on how the drug interacts with SARS in animal test subjects.\n\"Cell culture testing of an antiviral drug against the virus is only the first step, of many steps, necessary to develop an antiviral drug,\" said Kate Fowlie, a press officer for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in an email. \"It is important to realize that most antivirals that pass this cell culture test hurdle fail at later steps in the development process.\"\nRELATED: Hydroxychloroquine and coronavirus: what you need to know\nFinally: Fauci could not have known in 2005 that hydroxychloroquine was a potential treatment for COVID-19. Available evidence shows that the novel coronavirus first emerged in Hubei Province, China, in November.\nWhile the novel coronavirus is similar to SARS in some respects \u2014 both are human coronaviruses that originated in bats, cause respiratory illness and spread through coughs and sneezes \u2014 they are different diseases. COVID-19 has infected more than 3.5 million people worldwide compared to the 8,000 who were sickened during the 2003 SARS outbreak. While SARS cases are generally more severe, scientists believe that COVID-19 is more transmissible.\nAs One News Now notes, the novel coronavirus and SARS have a 79% genetic similarity and use the same \"host cell receptor,\" meaning they infect people in similar ways. But that doesn\u2019t mean the findings of the 2005 study apply to COVID-19.\n\"Whether chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine are of value for treating infections with the different, but related, SARS-CoV-2 virus cannot be answered by the data in the 2005 study,\" Fowlie said.\nOur ruling\nOne News Now wrote that Fauci \"has known for 15 years that chloroquine and \u2026 hydroxychloroquine will not only treat a current case of coronavirus but prevent future cases.\"\nThe website cited a study that has to do with SARS, not the novel coronavirus. It was published in 2005 in Virology Journal, which is not the \"official publication\" of the NIH.\u00a0\nWhile the study found that chloroquine helped inhibit the spread of SARS in cell cultures, those results do not suggest that the drug is an effective treatment for SARS or COVID-19. As of now, there is no approved treatment or vaccine for either coronavirus.\nThe One News Now article is inaccurate. We rate it False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18251"}
