But the Biden campaign told us in a statement that \"these claims are laughably false.\"\u00a0\nThe blog post cites the National File, which on Oct. 18 published a post that said affidavits filed as part of a lawsuit claimed to have \"video evidence, documentation and witnesses to prove that Biden\u2019s political director Dallas Jones and his cohorts are currently hoarding mail-in and absentee ballots and ordering operatives to fill the ballots out for people illegally, including for dead people, homeless people, and nursing home residents, in the 2020 election.\"\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in September by conservative activist Steve Hotze among other plaintiffs, sought to limit in-person and absentee voting options for voters in Harris County, where Houston is the county seat.\nIn October, Snopes dug into the lawsuit\u2019s allegations that some Texas officials were running an illegal ballot harvesting scheme, finding no evidence to corroborate the claim.\u00a0\nWe similarly found no evidence that Jones, a Houston political consultant who the Biden campaign tapped to serve as its Texas political director, has been charged with a crime or arrested.\u00a0\nWe looked at Harris County court records and found nothing to suggest he was charged with electoral fraud.\nJones told FactCheck.org, \"This is completely make believe and they\u2019re running with it.\"\u00a0\nWith no evidence to back the claim, we rate it False.\u00a0\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click here, for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18531"}
