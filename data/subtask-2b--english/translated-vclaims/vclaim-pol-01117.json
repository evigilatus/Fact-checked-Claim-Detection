One of the popular rumors that often occurs is that the former CEO of Clinton Eric Braverman was missing for a long time after he revealed Clinton's secrets. The full allegation, published on Facebook, says: \"Why did the main media silence the fact that the former CEO of the Clinton Foundation has been missing for 70 days, rumored to be the source that said: \"Follow the money and find the real scandal of the Human Rights Council?\" Where's Eric Braverman? A picture of Braverman is posted at the station next to the word \"message.\" This article was referred to as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We didn't find any evidence that Braverman was missing or hiding from the Clintons. The rumor has already been revealed by fact-checkers, and Braverman is currently serving as CEO of Schmidt Fjorks' California-based charity. Searching backwards on TinEye.com indicates even the Mimi himself is being carried out in two years of age. Although Braverman did not publish on social media for a while, he went to Twitter in January 19, 2017, to announce that he had accepted a position with the Schmidt Family Foundation. I'm excited to join @ericschmidt, @winschmidt, and an amazing team as we combine the power of people and technology to improve life. On January 12, 2021, he wrote in an Instagram article saying that Joe Biden remained silent about the violence in Black Lives-Mite protests. By Tom Kircher: 16 January 2021 - Eric Braverman (@eric_braverman) 19 January 2017 he is still posted on the organization &apos; s website as Executive Director of Schmidt Future, the Foundation &apos; s charitable arm. In one story, the only evidence presented was that Braverman did not respond to press inquiries and his lack of use of social media. This doesn't indicate a missing person. We didn't find any police reports indicating that Braverman was a \"missing person\" or well-known media reports detailing his disappearance. Braverman is a lawyer and businessman who chaired the Clinton Foundation from 2013 to 2015 when he resigned. His disappearance is rumored to have been exchanged by social media users since October 2016 at least. This timing suggests that it may have evolved from John Bodista's e-mail that WikiLeaks dropped in October and November 2016. In an e-mail, Bodista (who served as head of the Hillary Clinton campaign) indicates that Braverman could be an unnamed journalist. But in the same e-mail, he also throws out other names. At about the same time, in autumn 2016, conspiracy websites began another false rumor, according to which Braverman applied for asylum in Russia after his name was revealed in WikiLeaks. This allegation was also distorted. Our judgment, Amy, says that Braverman was \"missing for 70 days\" after he was rumored to be the source of the quote, \"Follow the money and find the real Harvee scandal.\" We found no evidence that Braverman was missing or missing, and he is currently on the list as CEO of a California-based charity.
