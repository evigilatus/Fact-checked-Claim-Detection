Scott Walker, has pledged to seek $606.1 million increase in funding for special education programs, which would bring funding for such services to $900 million by 2021.\n\"School districts have a legal obligation to kids with disabilities, and they are required to provide those services,\" Evers said when he made the announcement. \"That, in turn, puts pressure on the rest of the school budget. It\u2019s time to change that momentum.\"\nStates use different methods to allocate special education funds. Wisconsin is one of five that reimburse schools for the costs incurred for educating special-needs students. It is considered \"categorical aid\" -- that is, based on a category outside of the regular funding formula.\nAccording to a report from the state Department of Public Instruction: \"This categorical aid is the state\u2019s primary direct fund source to recognize the additional costs of educating pupils with disabilities. This critical aid program has widespread statewide impact providing funding for all pupils with disabilities, approximately 14 percent of Wisconsin pupils, providing equal benefit across all school districts.\"\nEvers\u2019 request would more than double the state reimbursement rate for school districts\u2019 special education costs, from 27 percent to 60 percent by 2019.\n\"We\u2019re going to add $600 million to special education categorical aid; it hasn\u2019t been raised in over a decade,\" Evers said at a primary election forum broadcast Aug. 16, 2018, by WRRD Resistance Radio \"Devil\u2019s Advocates.\"\nIs Evers right?\n\nThe evidence\n\nWhen asked about special education funding, a spokesman for the state Department of Public Instruction directed PolitiFact Wisconsin to the Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau, a nonpartisan entity considered the gold standard on state budget matters.\nAccording to the fiscal bureau, in the 2006-2007 budget, the number was just over $350 million. In every year since then, the total has been just under $369 million -- $368,939,100, to be exact.\nAbdur Chowdhury, Marquette University Department of Economics Professor Emeritus, said inflation in the U.S. from 2007-\u201918 averaged between 1 percent and 2 percent. Thus, he said, \"in later years, you need to provide more nominal aid in order to be equal to real aid in the early years.\"\nSo, to keep up with inflation, the $368,939,100 in fiscal year 2007 aid would have to have amounted to this much in subsequent years:\n2008-\u201909 -- $381,741,700\n2009-\u201910 -- $388,003,320\n2010-\u201911-- $400,250,755\n2011-\u201912 -- $408,533,744\n2012-\u201913 -- $414,517,781\n2013-\u201914 -- $421,242,038\n2014-\u201915 -- $421,742,043\n2015-\u201916 -- $427,062,373\n2016-\u201917 -- $436,160,315\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Steineke\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembly Republicans \u201chave come to the table\u201d and were part of \u201cgive and take\u201d compromise on a coronavirus bill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the same time, the report notes that while costs have increased, Wisconsin has experienced a decrease in special education enrollment since fiscal year 2007:\n2007-2008 -- 124,520\n2008-2009 -- 123,734\n2009-2010 -- 123,412\n2010-2011 -- 122,763\n2011-2012 -- 121,881\n2012-2013 -- 121,378\n2013-2014 -- 120,698\n2014-2015 -- 118,601\n2015-2016 -- 118,923\n2016 -2017 -- 118,209\nThat represents an enrollment drop of 5.07 percent from 2007-\u201908 to 2016-\u201917. The enrollment counts for 2018-\u201919 are not final, but they are expected to again decrease.\nSo, all this raises a question about what has happened with the per-student average -- and whether that has kept up with inflation.\nAccording to the Department of Public Instruction, special education costs per pupil in 2008-\u201909 was $10,388, with the state on average paying $2,981, or nearly 29 percent per pupil.\nIn 2018, the estimated cost per pupil is at $12,084, with the state on average paying $3,140, or nearly 26 percent per pupil.\nSo, had the per-pupil amount being paid by the state kept pace with inflation, it would be an estimated $3,489.18 in 2018, not the projected $3,140.\nA DPI spokesman pointed out that the per pupil figures are just special education costs, and \"those ride on top of regular education costs.\"\n\nThe Walker team\n\nWhen asked about Evers\u2019 claim, Walker campaign spokesman Austin Altenburg pointed PolitiFact Wisconsin to Walker education initiatives that feature targeted aid in the form of grants and other avenues for special education students:\n\nIn the last budget, the governor approved DPI\u2019s request for Special Education Transitions Incentive Grants ($6.1 million). This program provides payment to school districts based on postsecondary education and employment for pupils with disability. The definition of postsecondary is a reference to any education beyond high school.\nProject SEARCH, a business-led collaboration that helps young people with disabilities gain and maintain employment through hands-on training and in-field career exploration. Project SEARCH is a national program developed in Cincinnati in 1996 and has grown to include programs in 42 states. In 2014, Walker signed legislation for a $35.4 million expansion to the Wisconsin Fast Forward worker training program, which included $850,000 to expand Project SEARCH sites in the state from seven to 27 over three years.\nWalker approved Special Education Transitions Readiness Investment Grants ($1.5 million). These grants fund transportation for special needs students to internships or work, training for school staff, and additional staff to support coordinating work experiences for special needs students with local businesses and organizations.\nWalker proclaimed 2014 as a Year of a Better Bottom Line to promote the employment of people with disabilities.\n\nAltenburg did not say whether he was arguing these programs more than make up for the lack of increase in the main aid program. In any case, Evers was talking about the main categorical state aid for education, and that is what we are focusing on here.\n\nOur rating\n\nEvers said \"special education categorical aid\" from the state \"hasn\u2019t been raised in over a decade.\"\nThe Walker administration has launched several initiatives that feature targeted aid in the form of grants for special education students, but the special education categorical aid continues to be set at nearly $369 million.\nData shows a per-pupil increase in raw dollars paid by the state, from $2,981, or 28.6 percent, per pupil in 2008 to an estimated $3,140, or 25.98 percent, paid per pupil in 2018. But that increase is more than eaten away by inflation. And the state is paying a lower share of the cost per pupil.\nWe rate Evers\u2019 statement Mostly True.\u00a0  Share the Facts 2018-09-20 16:09:55 UTC   PolitiFact    5 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly True  \"Special education categorical aid\" from the state \"hasn\u2019t been raised in over a decade.\"    Tony Evers Democratic candidate for Wisconsin governor  https://realresistanceradio.com/podcast/8-16-18-the-devils-advocates-extended-coverage/   In a candidates forum Thursday, August 16, 2018 2018-08-16    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01591"}
