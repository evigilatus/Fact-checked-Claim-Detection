So it makes sense that they\u2019d want to resume them.\nThis is where state Senator Warren Daniel comes in. Daniel, a Republican from western North Carolina, tweeted on April 23 that hospitals might be punished if they choose to resume those procedures.\n\"It\u2019s being reported that NC DHHS is telling hospitals that if they decide to do elective surgeries, they won\u2019t be eligible to receive PPE from the state,\" Daniel tweeted, referring to personal protective equipment.\nHe suggested the alleged threat was contrived by Cohen. Aside from Gov. Roy Cooper, Cohen has been perhaps the state\u2019s most visible government official during the pandemic.\nDaniel referred to the decision as \"The heavy hand of government,\" adding: \"I hope Secretary Cohen will reverse course.\"\n\nWhen PolitiFact reached out to Daniel, he said he got the information from the N.C. Healthcare Association, which represents hospitals across the state.\nConversation with a staffer\nDaniel said the association \"reported to legislators last week that DHHS told them if hospitals began offering elective surgeries again, then the state would not give them additional PPE.\" He added: \"When I heard that I was shocked and thought it was something the public deserved to know.\"\nWe reached out to the NC Healthcare Association and were referred to Leah Burns, the group\u2019s senior director of government relations.\n\"I had a conversation with a staffer at DHHS where this notion was discussed that PPE would potentially be withheld from hospitals if hospitals began elective surgeries,\" Burns said. She declined to identify the DHHS staffer she spoke with.\n\"After my conversation with the DHHS staffer, I spoke with a legislative staffer about it. Since then, this idea has not come to fruition, and I do not believe DHHS is withholding PPE from any hospitals in North Carolina,\" Burns said. She declined to identify the legislative staffer she spoke with.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEight days after Daniel\u2019s tweet, on May 1, DHHS offered guidance to hospitals on how they could resume elective procedures. That letter mentions the lack of PPE across the state, stating: \"If appropriate PPE is unavailable to protect the health care worker or the supply of appropriate PPE is limited, then the non-time sensitive surgery or procedure should be cancelled.\"\nBut the letter doesn\u2019t say hospitals would be cut off from resources if they didn\u2019t obey the guidelines.\u00a0\nWhat DHHS said\nWhen we asked DHHS about Daniel\u2019s tweet, spokeswoman Amy Ellis denied his claim.\n\"That is false. Secretary Cohen did not say that,\" Ellis said in an email and referred us back to the hospital Association.\nWhen we relayed what Burns said, Ellis suggested someone got confused about the department\u2019s plans.\n\"Secretary Cohen has never indicated that,\" she said. \"Conversations between staffers can easily be misunderstood.\"\nSince Daniel posted his tweet, several North Carolina hospitals announced plans to resume some elective procedures.\nWhat hospitals said\nPolitiFact reached out to several hospital systems to see if DHHS threatened to withhold PPE.\n\"I\u2019m told that\u2019s not true,\" said Alan Wolf, spokesman for the UNC Health System. He added that UNC Health leaders and providers are growing concerned about further delays in care for some patients. UNC Health has been doing less than half its usual volume of procedures and will probably increase it to 65% to 75%, Linda Butler, the system\u2019s chief medical officer, recently told the News & Observer.\nDuke Health didn\u2019t receive any correspondence from DHHS indicating the department might withhold PPE, said Sarah Avery, director of Duke\u2019s Health News Office.\n\"Duke Health hospitals received a letter May 1 from the secretary of the state Department of Health and Human Services, Dr. Mandy Cohen, notifying us that the elective and non-urgent procedures and surgeries can be resumed in accordance with guidance developed by the North Carolina Healthcare Association (NCHA),\" Avery said.\u00a0\nNovant and Wake Forest Baptist hospitals also plan to resume elective procedures, according to the Winston-Salem Journal. PolitiFact called and emailed those health systems, but neither responded to questions about Daniel\u2019s claim.\nOur ruling\nSen. Daniel tweeted: \"It\u2019s being reported that NC DHHS is telling hospitals that if they decide to do elective surgeries, they won\u2019t be eligible to receive PPE from the state.\" Let\u2019s break that down.\nThe only \"report\" Daniel cited -- and the only report PolitiFact could track down -- was a conversation between a DHHS staffer and a representative for the North Carolina Healthcare Association. DHHS denied that the staffer said what the association\u2019s representative claimed, describing their conversation as a misunderstanding.\u00a0\nDaniel said \"DHHS is telling hospitals\" about the conditions for receiving PPE. But hospitals who spoke to PolitiFact said they were never given the alleged ultimatum.\u00a0\nDaniel\u2019s tweet also tied the ultimatum to secretary Cohen. But, in her email to PolitiFact, the association\u2019s representative didn\u2019t tie the \"notion\" to Cohen, and we couldn\u2019t find any other evidence that DHHS threatened to withhold PPE from hospitals that resumed elective surgeries.\u00a0\nThis leaves us with a he said-she said situation about a claim that never came to fruition. Given Daniel\u2019s claim lacks evidence, we rate it false.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18278"}
