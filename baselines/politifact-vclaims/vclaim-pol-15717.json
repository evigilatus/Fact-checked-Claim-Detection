More and more, it seems.\n\n\nIn a Twitter message on May 30, 2009, Sen. John McCain took this poke at the Obama administration:\n\n\n\"Obama has more czars than the Romanovs \u2014 who ruled Russia for 3 centuries. Romanovs 18, cyberczar makes 20.\"\n\n\nFirst of all, yes, John McCain \u2014 the guy criticized during the presidential campaign for being computer illiterate \u2014 is tweeting.\n\n\nBut what about the czars? It sure seems like we keep reading about one czar after another being appointed to oversee the auto industry, the Great Lakes, and the closure of Gitmo, and we wondered: Just how many czars does the Obama administration actually have?\n\n\nFirst off, the Obama administration doesn't usually call any of these people czars. We only found two instances of President Barack Obama using the term, once in an April 15, 2009, interview with\n\nCNN En Espanol\n\nwhen he talked about the role of his \"border czar,\" and once during the campaign when he promised to appoint an \"autism czar\" to coordinate a nationwide autism effort (he hasn't yet). And in announcing Obama's nomination of Gil Kerlikowske as director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, Vice President Joe Biden referred to the position as \"our nation's drug czar.\"\n\n\nWe're sure there are more, but the point is that, by and large, you don't often hear the administration talking about its czars.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, the administration has at times gone to some lengths to avoid the moniker, as was the case in this somewhat humorous (in an inside-the-Beltway sorta way) exchange between a reporter and White House spokesman Robert Gibbs on June 10, 2009:\n\n\n\nReporter: On Ken Feinberg, I think that he's maybe the 20th czar-type position you've named.\n\n\u00a0\n\nGibbs:\u00a0 No, I think the title is \"special master.\"\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSo who exactly qualifies as a czar? As best we can tell, it's whenever someone in the media says so. You can identify a guy as \"Assistant to the President for Science and Technology, Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, and Co-Chair of the President\u2019s Council of Advisers on Science and Technology,\" but it's a lot easier on everyone to just say \"Science Czar.\" And \"Special Master\" sounds like Richie Rich's best friend.\n\n\nSo the title of czar is largely arbitrary media shorthand for \"It's this person's job to make sure (blank) goes right.\" And we think everyone can agree that \"Terrorism Czar\" sounds way cooler than \"Deputy National Security Adviser for Homeland Security.\"\n\n\nBelow, we have compiled a wildly unscientific list of Obama administration \"czars.\" But we're not the first. Talking Points Memo has a slideshow of Obama's \"czars.\"\n\nThey count 23\n\n. And ForeignPolicy.com came up with\n\nat least 18.\n\nWe've got 28.\n\n\nSome of these \"czars\" are carryover positions from previous administrations. And \"czars\" go way back in presidential history. Roosevelt had a slew of so-called czars. But to the extent that Obama has created a number of new positions to oversee various issues and to cut through bureaucratic red tape, he seems to have a lot more czars than his predecessors. Or you could argue that the media has just seized on a new buzzword it likes. We're not going to wade into the debate about whether having more czars is a good idea, but Fox\n\nran a story\n\nabout concerns some lawmakers have with it.\n\n\nWe're just fact-checking McCain's claim that Obama has more czars than the Romanovs. According to the\n\nWorld Book Encyclopedia\n\n, there were, as McCain said, 18 Romanov czars, starting with Michael Romanov in 1613 and ending with Nicholas II, who was killed by the Bolsheviks in 1918.\n\n\nAs for Obama's czars, we've got 28 who have been referred to as a czar ... somewhere. Undoubtedly some will take issue with some of the \"czars\" on our list, but we think McCain is on solid ground. He earns a True.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\n\n\n\n\nCzar Title\n\n\n\n\nActual (boring) Title\n\n\n\n\n\nHerb Allison\n\n\nTARP Czar\n\n\nAssistant Secretary of the Treasury for Financial Stability\n\n\n\n\nAlan Bersin\n\n\nBorder Czar\n\n\nAssistant Secretary for International Affairs and Special Representative for Border Affairs\n\n\n\n\nDennis Blair\n\n\nIntelligence Czar\n\n\nDirector of National Intelligence\n\n\n\n\nJohn Brennan\n\n\nTerrorism Czar\n\n\nDeputy National Security Adviser for Homeland Security\n\n\n\n\nCarol Browner\n\n\nEnergy Czar\n\n\nAssistant to the President for Energy and Climate Change\n\n\n\n\nAdolfo Carrion, Jr\n\n\nUrban Affairs Czar\n\n\nDirector of the White House Office of Urban Affairs\n\n\n\n\nAshton Carter\n\n\nWeapons Czar\n\n\nUnder Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics\n\n\n\n\nAneesh Chopra\n\n\nTechnology Czar\n\n\nChief Technology Officer\n\n\n\n\nJeffrey Crowley\n\n\nAIDS Czar\n\n\nDirector of the Office of National AIDS Policy\n\n\n\n\nCameron Davis\n\n\nGreat Lakes Czar\n\n\nSpecial advisor to the U.S. EPA overseeing its Great Lakes restoration plan\n\n\n\n\nNancy-Ann DeParle\n\n\nHealth Czar\n\n\nDirector of the White House Office of Health Reform\n\n\n\n\nEarl Devaney\n\n\nStimulus Accountability Czar\n\n\nChair of the Recovery Act Transparency and Accountability Board\n\n\n\n\nJoshua DuBois\n\n\nFaith-based Czar\n\n\nDirector of the Office of Faith Based and Neighborhood Partnerships\n\n\n\n\nKenneth Feinberg\n\n\nPay Czar\n\n\nSpecial Master on executive pay\n\n\n\n\nDanny Fried\n\n\nGuantanamo Closure Czar\n\n\nSpecial envoy to oversee the closure of the detention center at Guantanamo Bay\n\n\n\n\n\nJ.
