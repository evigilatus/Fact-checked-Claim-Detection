He didn\u2019t say President Donald Trump will go down in history as one of the greatest presidents. He didn\u2019t say \"his COVID-19 vaccine might kill nearly 1 million people.\" He didn\u2019t say a vaccine \"will use experimental technology and permanently alter your DNA.\" He didn\u2019t say church services can\u2019t resume until everyone is vaccinated.\nA Facebook post attributes a new quote to the Microsoft co-founder.\n\"This is Bill Gates statement from last night on CNN,\" it says, before quoting Gates as saying: \"We need to develop a digital certificate that shows who has received all the vaccinations.

Later, he talked about wanting to \"convince people, at least over 80 percent, to take this vaccine.\" He also addressed conspiracy theories and falsehoods that have spread about him and the coronavirus.\u00a0\n\"I hope it doesn\u2019t create vaccine hesitancy,\" he said. \"I hope the conspiracy stuff dies down.\"\nWe rate this post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17048"}
