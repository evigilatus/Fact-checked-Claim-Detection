(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe first few words of the quote do resemble what Washington, the first U.S. president, said during his first annual address to Congress in 1790. But the rest of the quote is manipulated and inaccurate, according to mountvernon.org, the Mount Vernon Ladies\u2019 Association, which is dedicated to preserving, restoring and managing Washington\u2019s estate and to educating people about his life and legacies.\nThe meme\u2019s quote is part of a mountvernon.org list of \"spurious quotations\" misattributed to Washington.

However, the quote is then manipulated into a differing context and the remaining text is inaccurate.\"\nHere\u2019s the accurate version of Washington said:\n\"A free people ought not only to be armed, but disciplined; to which end a uniform and well-digested plan is requisite; and their safety and interest require that they should promote such manufactories as tend to render them independent of others for essential, particularly military, supplies.\"\nWashington \"was a strong proponent of a robust national defense\" and during his first annual address to Congress argued for lawmakers to take a role in promoting the domestic manufacture of weapons and ammunition to avoid the supply issues that the Continental Army faced during the Revolutionary War, said mountvernon.org.\nThe Facebook post contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.
