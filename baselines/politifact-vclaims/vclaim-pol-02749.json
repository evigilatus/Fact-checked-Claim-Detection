Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.,\u00a0spoke Sept. 21 at Westminster College\u00a0in Fulton, where he laid out his vision for foreign policy.\n\n\nLike many of his other speeches, he touched on economic disparity and said, \"There is no moral or economic justification for the six wealthiest people in the world having as much wealth as the bottom half of the world\u2019s population, 3.7 billion people.\"\n\n\nWe wanted to know if it is possible that the collective wealth of the six richest people could equal more than that of half the world\u2019s entire population.\n\n\nWhere is this coming from?\n\n\nSanders\u2019 source is a 2017\u00a0Oxfam report\u00a0that is put together using numbers from\u00a0Forbes\u00a0and Credit Suisse\u2019s\u00a0Global Wealth Databook, according to Joshua Miller-Lewis, Sanders\u2019 press secretary.\n\n\nThe Oxfam report states that the eight richest men in the world had as much wealth as 3.6 billion people in the world, or half that population. But since that report, the numbers have changed: The rich have gotten richer while overall global wealth has decreased, according to the underlying data used by Oxfam.\n\n\nOxfam\u2019s calculations come from wealth estimates by Credit Suisse, a Swiss multinational financial services holding company, said Laura Rusu, policy and campaigns media manager for Oxfam America.\n\n\nBased on the latest data from Credit Suisse, the wealth of the bottom 50 percent of the global population is $409 billion. The six wealthiest people in the world add up to about $416.2 billion, according to Forbes.\n\n\n\"The 1 percent now controls more wealth than the 99 percent of the rest of us combined, and it\u2019s only getting worse,\" said Rusu.\n\n\nThe six richest people, according to Forbes billionaire list, are Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, Jeff Bezos, Amancio Ortega, Mark Zuckerberg and Carlos Slim Hel\u00fa .\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNational Republican Congressional Committee\n\n\nstated on May 2, 2012 in an email statement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Rep. Betty Sutton \"would rather riot with Occupy (Wall Street) than stand up for Ohio families.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Henry J. Gomez \u2022 May 9, 2012\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nSome caveats\n\n\nWhile Sanders\u2019 claim is accurate, there are some notes of caution.\n\n\n\"I think this statement is correct but it is not very meaningful because the bottom 50 percent has essentially no wealth,\" said economist\u00a0Emmanuel Saez\u00a0of the University of California, Berkeley.\n\n\nWhile many of the economists we spoke to agreed that the statement is technically correct, the issue lies with wealth measures.\n\n\nMost of the wealth of the rich is from fungible private wealth, which is an asset\u2019s interchangeability with assets of the same type. \"It is probably the case that one-half the world\u2019s population has almost no fungible private wealth. So by that measure, Bernie Sanders may be right,\" said\u00a0Richard Burkhauser, professor emeritus of policy analysis at Cornell University College of Human Ecology.\n\n\nRusu further explained that the Oxfam reports have seen a drop in private wealth, compared to the world\u2019s collective wealth, but this has to do with an improved data collection method and not necessarily a change in people\u2019s wealth.\n\n\n\"The dramatic drop isn\u2019t due purely to a sharp increase in inequality, but rather the availability of better data,\" Rusu told PolitiFact Missouri.\n\n\nOur ruling\n\n\nWhile giving a speech in Fulton, Missouri, Bernie Sanders stated that the six richest people in the world had as much wealth as the bottom half of the world\u2019s 3.7 billion people.\n\n\nAccording to global wealth disparity research, it is factually accurate to say that six men are, collectively, richer than the bottom 50 percent of the world.\n\n\nHowever, an expert cautioned about reading too much into this specific statistic because of the way wealth is measured and improvements in data collection.\n\n\nSanders\u2019 statement is accurate but needs clarification.
