Antifa stands for \"anti-fascist,\" and it is not a group but a broad coalition of activists.\u00a0\nOthers focused on specific protesters who forced their way inside the Capitol and were shown in photographs, such as a bare-chested man who wore face paint and a horned fur cap.\n\"These are NOT Trump supporters,\" said one Jan. 6 Facebook post. \"Antifa THUGS.\" The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

The man, Jake Angeli, supports Trump and is a well-known supporter of the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory. He goes by the moniker, \"Q Shaman,\" and he told the Arizona Republic he uses his unique outfit to stand out.\nPoynter reported that in December, Angeli launched an online crowdfunding campaign to fund his participation in pro-Trump events.\u00a0\nThe Arizona Republic described him as \"a QAnon supporter who has been a fixture at Arizona right-wing political rallies over the past year.\" The Associated Press reported that he was also seen in the same signature headwear at a pro-Trump rally Nov. 7 in Phoenix.\n\nJake Angeli speaks at a rally outside the Maricopa County Recorder's Office on Nov. 7, 2020, in Phoenix.

(Followers of QAnon believe Trump is leading a fight against a global cabal of Satan-worshipping pedophiles.)\nFalse claims linking Angeli and other people who mobbed the Capitol to antifa took off online in the hours after the event. An NBC News analysis identified thousands of tweets that accused antifa members of \"posing\" as Trump supporters.\u00a0\nAngeli responded on Twitter when Lin Wood, an attorney who has filed lawsuits seeking to overturn the presidential election, posted photos of Angeli and claimed he is an antifa activist. The Daily Beast\u2019s Will Sommer, who covers QAnon closely, highlighted the exchange.\n\"Mr. Wood. I am not antifa or blm,\" Angeli\u2019s tweet said. \"I'm a Qanon & digital soldier. My name is Jake & I marched with the police & fought against BLM & ANTIFA in PHX.\"\nThere remains no credible evidence that the Trump supporters who stormed the U.S. Capitol were antifa activists. Video and photos from the scene show many people wearing and waving Trump-branded paraphernalia and flags.\nTrump spoke to a rally of supporters in Washington hours before the violence erupted, and he had urged them to come to the city on Jan. 6 and back his efforts to overturn the election. He encouraged the rally to march to Congress and suggested he\u2019d join them. He did not.\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post said a man who was photographed storming the U.S. Capitol in a horned fur cap is an \"Antifa thug.\" The man is a known QAnon supporter who has backed Trump.\nWe rate this post Pants on Fire!\nRELATED:\u00a0A day of crisis at the US Capitol, fact-checked\nRELATED:\u00a0Is this a coup?
