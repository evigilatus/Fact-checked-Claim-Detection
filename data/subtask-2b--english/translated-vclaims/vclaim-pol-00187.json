The new Green Agreement does not mention air travel, let alone its disposal. The termination of air travel is not part of the plan of the U.S. Republic of Alexandria Okasio-Cortez, D-NY, revealed the home version of the new green deal 7 February. In the Senate, the Democrat Massachusetts Ed Markie provided facilities. In general, these decisions reflect the aspirations to reduce climate change and protect the environment by investing in renewable energy and infrastructure, in an equitable manner and creating jobs. Even if the two Councils pass, the resolution is not binding. The initial proposal was met with great courage among the Democrats. The House of Representatives version had 89 democratic sponsors, and nearly a dozen members of the Democratic Senate - including the presidential candidates Kuri Booker, Kristin Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobochar, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren - sponsored their version in the room. What does the new green deal say about air travel? In one word, nothing. He doesn't mention planes at all. It calls for \"the excessive transportation system in the United States to remove pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector to the extent technologically feasible,\" which includes \"investment in high-speed railways.\" Yang's campaign did not respond to our request for comment. But his confusion may return to the beginning of the new green deal - which has become the basis of the point of talk (mostly Republican) about Democrats wishing to phase out commercial air travel. As soon as the new green agreement was unveiled, the Ocacio Cortez office issued repeated questions, or FAQ, as a complement to the plan. The document mentioned the aircraft twice, and (sure we have) \"We are not sure that we will be able to completely get rid of the fare from the cows and planes so quickly, but we believe that we can increase renewable manufacturing and energy production, repair every building in America, build a smart network, repair transportation and agriculture, plant a lot of trees, and restore our ecosystem to zero net.\" The United States Armed Forces also called on the United States \"to fully repair transport through the massive expansion of electric vehicle manufacture, the construction of shipping stations everywhere, the construction of high-speed railways on a scale where air travel stops become necessary, and the creation of affordable public transport, with a view to replacing each combustion engine.\" The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" By Samantha Buterman: January 11, 2021, a Republican politician, including President Donald Trump, senators, and conservative media outlets turned on the idea that Democrats wanted to make air travel obsolete. The press office in Ocacio-Cortez did not respond to this verification of the facts, but its Chief of Staff had previously said that there were many common documents among the various interest groups, and that the issuance of this particular document was a mistake. Check the facts in the Politi Fact, Washington Post, and check the facts.org But as Yang's statement shows, the idea still exists. Climate change experts say that ending air travel is not a goal when we considered this allegation earlier, and climate change experts told us that it is important to focus on the language used in the actual solution and not in the questionnaire, which does not carry weight. \"It seems to me that those lines of FAQ were light-hearted and unconsidered, and it is not clear why they were published,\" said Sean Hecht, Co-Executive Director, Emmett Institute for Climate Change and Environment at the University of California. Air travel retains a unique role in moving people for long distances. \"When people classify the difficulty of finding structural solutions to greenhouse gas emissions in various sectors, air travel is one of the most difficult both technological and practical proposals, and there are no serious political proposals so far that would resolve the issue by limiting air travel or changing the energy sources of commercial aircraft on a large scale.\" \"So it's not a policy priority\" Paul Bledsoe, a strategic adviser at the Institute for Progressive Policy and lecturer in environmental policy at the American University, said that electric aircraft might be possible in the long term. He said Bledsoe, who was a climate change adviser at the White House of Clinton. The governor Yang said the new green deal \"will get rid of commercial air travel.\" The resolution does not refer to the termination of air travel. Instead, it calls for \"excess transport systems,\" which include \"investment in high-speed railways.\" His claim may go back to a republican point of discussion, based on a letter document from the Democrats who, perhaps in joking, mentioned the elimination of \"cows and aircraft fire.\" However, we have found no evidence that the disposal of aircraft is a serious political idea from climate advocates. We're assessing this statement wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00187"}
