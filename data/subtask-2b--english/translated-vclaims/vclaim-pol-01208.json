Paul Espinosa made efforts to increase teachers' salaries, and attacked Democrats because they caused the problem of low wages in the first place. On 9 October, Espinosa, who chairs the Education Committee of the House of Representatives, Twittered \"from 1990 to 2015 under democratic control, teacher W. Our legislature, led by the World Democratic Party, is committed to reversing this decline by passing on the largest increase in gross wages in the history of our mandate. From 1990 to 2015 under democratic control, the salary of the W. Va teacher fell from 30 in the country to 48. Our legislature, led by the World Democratic Party, is committed to reversing this decline by passing on the largest increase in gross wages in the history of our mandate. On 9 October 2018, Mr. Paul Espinosa said that he was quoting the figures originally provided by the Governor &apos; s office, but we decided to take a look at the original statements. The West Virginia ranking at the national level varies slightly from measurement to measurement, but there is no doubt that West Virginia is currently located near the bottom of the 50 states in teachers &apos; wages. The CNN article was published around the time of the teachers &apos; strike on March 5, 2018, linking the state in the nation &apos; s 48th -- in line with number two Espinosa. The article cited the data collected by the National Association for Education, a prominent teacher &apos; s union. We were able to find a newer figure from the National Energy Agency, covering 2017, and by that time, the West Virginia arrangement had worsened. It fell for the second consecutive year, to 49. At the same time, we have located data from surveys conducted earlier by the National Energy Agency and found that West Virginia has not ranked 44th since 2004. However, we were unable to find the data of the National Energy Agency on the Internet before 2003, so we instead moved on to the data collected by the Federal Ministry of Education. This set of data dates back to the late 1960s. The following table compares the salaries of teachers in West Virginia with those of national teachers at different intervals since the 1969-70 school year. This shows that wages in West Virginia have exceeded national pay by a fairly fixed margin since at least 2000. It also appears that teachers &apos; wages have not kept pace with inflation over the past decade. Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" \u2022 26 January 2021, with regard to the West Virginia arrangement at the national level, the arrangement dropped rapidly between about 1970 and 1990, and rose upwards before beginning to decline again around 2000. This follows contemporary news coverage of the teachers' strike in West Virginia in 1990, which came when the teachers' salary was almost at the bottom of the order, according to the school week. In the 1989-1990 school year, the previous strike period, West Virginia ranked 48th. To find a state estimate of about 30 in the country, you have to go back to the end of the 1960s. So Espinosa has the point that West Virginia's professor was pushed to two places from the bottom by the year 2015, but he overestimated the heights from which he fell. Are Democrats to blame? This is more mixed than Espinosa. First, the time period is chosen with cherry. The legislature has been dominated by Democrats for decades until the People &apos; s Democratic Party won control in the 2014 elections. With the expiration of its 2015 deadline, Espinosa overlooks the period during which the General Democratic Party controls the legislature - the period during which the salary ranking of teachers in the state has declined, according to the annual data of the National Energy Agency. In addition, the time frame from 1990 to 2015 falls short of the Republican State of Archie Moore (which served three non-sequential terms, 1969 to 1977 and 1985 to 1989). He also abolishes the position of current Governor of Jim Justis, who was democratically elected but later transformed into the General Democratic Party. At present, both the Governor and the two houses of the legislature are dominated by Republicans. As is the case, the largest increase in the salary ranking of teachers during the period mentioned by Espinosa was between 1990 and 2000. During most of that period, the State had a democratic ruler, Gaston Kiberton. A few years of that time period were under the rule of a Republican Governor, Cecil Underwood. In the end, party blame does not fall exclusively on Democrats. Governor Espinosa said, \"From 1990 to 2015 under the control of (democratic), Push W. Fa. There is no doubt that a West Virginia teacher is currently paying at a rank close to the lowest 50 states, but he has overestimated the extent to which these grades have declined since 1990. In addition, the largest increase in wages during that period occurred during the term of a democratic governor, undermining the argument that Democrats are fully responsible. We're mostly assessing the statement wrong.
