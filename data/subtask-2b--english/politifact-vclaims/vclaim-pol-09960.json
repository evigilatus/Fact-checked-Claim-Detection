That means the birth certificates the way they are now, the forms, would not say \u2018mother\u2019 and \u2018father.\u2019\"\n\nMom and Dad absent from birth certificates?\n\nAsked the basis of his claim, Saenz told us by email the proposal filed by Rep. Rafael Anchia, D-Dallas, for consideration by the 2013 Legislature strips references to a mother and father from supplemental birth certificates, which describes certificates mostly issued in adoption cases.\n\nSaenz said in the TV interview: \"So if you wanted them, any parent wants them,\" meaning birth certificates, \"they\u2019re not going to have \u2018mother\u2019 and \u2018father\u2019 on there. So this isn\u2019t just about the homosexual lobby wanting their rights. It\u2019s partly about that issue, but this change in the law would impact everyone\u2019s birth certificates.\"\n\nChuck Smith, executive director of Equality Texas, which says it lobbies for the elimination of discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity/expression, said in an email and online post that partly because Anchia\u2019s House Bill 201 only applies to birth certificates issued in adoption cases, Saenz\u2019s claim is incorrect, a critique that Anchia echoed by telephone. Smith initially brought Saenz\u2019s claim to our attention.\n\nNearly 30,000 so-called \"supplemental\" birth certificates were filed by the state from September 2011 through August 2012, according to Christine Mann, a spokeswoman for the Texas Department of State Health Services, which filed nearly 388,000 regular birth certificates, the kind issued after babies are born, in the period. Both types, once issued, look the same, she said by email.\n\nAnchia\u2019s proposal would replace a provision in the Texas Health and Safety Code saying that on a supplemental birth certificate, one parent must be a female, named as the mother, and the other a male, named as the father. The law would say instead that the \"supplementary birth certificate of an adopted child must be in the names of both adoptive parents,\" not specifying genders. The measure would take effect in September 2013.\n\nThe way the law now works for same-sex couples is that one adoptive parent must choose to be designated as the father, in the case of a male couple, or the mother, in the case of a female couple, and the other parent is not listed on the resulting birth certificate, according to information posted online by State Health Services. By email, Mann confirmed that the 1997 Legislature put the gender-specific requirement in place of the previous law requiring only that parents be listed.\n\nSo, would mother and father fade from Texas birth certificates in general?\n\nWe noticed that the fiscal note for a similar proposal offered by Anchia in the 2011 session quotes State Health Services as saying relevant forms would be modified to show \"Parent 1\" and \"Parent 2.\" In contrast, the \"Certificate of Adoption\" form now filled out to obtain a supplemental birth certificate has spaces for applicants to designate the child\u2019s mother and father.\n\nBy phone, two lawyers with expertise in adoption cases told us they do not read Anchia\u2019s proposal as Saenz does.\n\nMichael Lackmeyer of Killeen said the proposal solely relates to birth certificates in adoption cases, not \u00a0the vast majority issued after babies are born. Also, he said, he believes the state could keep the existing application for supplemental certificates, perhaps amended with instructions stating the adopting mother need not be a female nor the father a male.\n\n\"I don\u2019t really think it\u2019s going to do quite what the opposition thinks it\u2019s going to do,\" Lackmeyer said.\n\nJeff Barnett of Austin agreed, saying nothing in the proposal should lead to certificates issued after birth losing \"mother\" and \"father\" designations. All the proposal does is remove the hurdle that one adopting parent be male and the other female, Barnett said.\n\nIn contrast, Mann of State Health Services offered an uncertain analysis, saying by email that while the proposal may not appear to affect all certificates, that remains a possibility.\n\nIf the \"modification is made to only supplementary birth records, it may have the effect of identifying adopted persons,\" Mann wrote. \"If you modify just the supplementary birth records of adopted persons by including only gender-neutral references to the parents (e.g. \u2018parent 1\u2019 and \u2018parent 2\u2019) and leave all other birth records with the \u2018mother\u2019 and \u2018father\u2019 references, that gender neutral reference/record distinguishes adopted person\u2019s records and thus identifies them, which under current state law, is prohibited. As a result,\" she said, \"we would have to have a consistent reference on all birth certificates going forward so as to not bring attention to those which are for adopted persons.\"\n\nWe had asked Mann if Anchia's proposal would result in \"mother\" and \"father\" entries going away from all certificates.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShe replied: \"The answer may be no if we can find a way to add \u2018or parent\u2019 \u2018or co-parent\u2019 or some other additional category along with \u2018mother\u2019 and \u2018father\u2019 to provide the gender-neutral option provided by the (legislation) on all certificates such as \u2018Mother or Parent 1\u2019 and \u2018Father or Parent 2.\u2019 This may be an issue of space on the certificates, so it\u2019s unclear at this point if this is an option.\"\n\nMann also said the agency \"would need to modify more than 20 forms which currently reflect the names of the mother and father to show parent and co-parent to comply with this bill. These modifications would result in programming changes which must be made to the Texas Electronic Registrar and Remote Issuance systems, as well as the Texas.gov web portal. These changes would affect all birth certificates yet to be issued. It would not affect birth certificates already issued.\"\n\nFinally, we ran her comments by Saenz, Smith and the outside lawyers. Saenz said they uphold his claim. Smith stressed that no form changes are required by Anchia\u2019s proposal.\n\nLackmeyer said by email that \"even though the changes address only supplemental\" birth certificates, \"who knows what any state agency will do to the entire system to implement that minor change?\"\n\nBy email, Barnett said the proposal still does not mandate the removal of \"mother\" and \"father\" from certificates.\n\nOur ruling\n\nThe leader of Texas Values says a proposed change in law would strip \"mother\" and \"father\" from Texas birth certificates.\n\nThe proposal would eliminate a requirement that adoptive couples seeking a birth certificate list a male father and female mother. But nothing in the proposal explicitly removes mother and father entries on certificates and it seems reasonable to us that any needed tweaks could be made without Moms and Dads vanishing from them.\n\nThen again, the state agency spokeswoman was uncertain about the proposal's effect, which sways us to say that Saenz's claim has an element of truth. We rate it Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09960"}
