Trump recently told Internal Security Minister Kirsten Nelson, \"I know what you're going through with families is very difficult, but these are the bad laws that Democrats have given us. We have to break up with families.\" However, there is no law providing for the separation of children from their parents. The Trump Administration has devised a policy for this purpose. What's Trump talking about? When the parents are charged with a federal misdemeanour (entry without inspection in this case), or pending trial, they are placed in the custody of the United States. Marshal service. Children cannot enter prison and are therefore transferred to the Office of Health and Humanitarian Services for the resettlement of refugees. They are then placed with their relatives, juvenile detention centres or cr\u00e8ches. This is the old internal security policy, as the Ministry of National Security has told us. Before the Trump administration, migrants who enter illegally as families were rarely prosecuted, as stated by Sarah Pierce, an associate policy analyst in the United States immigration programme at the Institute of Migration Policy. Instead, migrants are detained in family detention centres until they are sent to appear before the Migration Court or until they are deported. Prosecutor Jeff announced on April 6 that the Internal Security Department would now refer all illegal border crossings to the Ministry of Justice for prosecution. In the face of criminal charges, parents go to detention centres, leaving their children unaccompanied. The decision to prosecute the parents is the reason for the separation. On February 1, 2021, Tom Cotton mentioned in an interview with Fox and friends \"Many of these arriving immigrants, we have no way of checking their background for either health or security.\" By Miriam Valverdi, 3 February 2021, \"This is an option they have made that is very different from that of other departments,\" said Peter Margolis, a professor of immigration law and national security law at Roger Williams University Law School. When we asked for evidence of policies to separate families, the White House referred us to clauses specifying what happened to unaccompanied migrant minors. However, none of the children concerned would be considered unaccompanied if the Trump administration did not decide to prosecute their parents. For example, the 1997 Flores Settlement Agreement calls for the release of unaccompanied minors to their family members or sponsors who can take care of them when deciding their immigration cases. The Reauthorization of the Protection of Victims of Trafficking Act 2008, mistakenly called Tramp a \"democratic provision,\" provides for the transfer of unaccompanied minors to health facilities and humanitarian services. The White House argues that these policies encourage parents to send their children to the United States, knowing that they will be released immediately. \"The cruel and inhuman open border policies of the Democratic Party are responsible for promoting massive illegal migration, enabling the smuggling of horrible children and releasing members of violent MS-13 gangs in American societies,\" said the White House Deputy Press Minister, Hogan Gedley, in an e-mail statement. The Trump administration may believe that Democrats are responsible for policies that encourage illegal border crossing, but we have not found a law that provides for the separation of children from their parents. Our rule, Trump, said \"a terrible law\" that requires the separation of children from their parents \"as soon as they cross the border into the United States.\" There is no such law. It has long been the policy of the Ministry of National Security to separate children from their guards when they are brought to criminal trial. The Trump Administration has decided to prosecute all illegal crossings. Families are rarely prosecuted under previous administrations. We're assessing this statement wrong.
