However, that\u2019s not his official campaign proposal.\nBiden\u2019s changes would repeal provisions in President Donald Trump\u2019s tax law for taxpayers earning over $400,000. Specifically, Biden would:\n\n\nIncrease the top corporate tax rate to 28% from 21%;\n\n\nRaise the top individual federal income tax rate to 39.6%;\n\n\nPlace a 12.4% Social Security tax on incomes above $400,000;\n\n\nTax capital gains at the same rate as ordinary income for very high earners.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the 2017 tax law, \u201cpeople who make under $75,000 will have their taxes raised in 2021 and every 2 years after that until 2027.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndependent tax analysts side with Biden\u2019s characterization of his plan.\nThe Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a group that\u2019s hawkish on the federal budget deficit, has confirmed that no direct taxes would be imposed on any household making less than $400,000 per year. Households below $400,000 a year could face small income losses indirectly, largely from the portion of higher corporate taxes that companies pass along to their workers through constraints on compensation.\nThe group concluded that \"overall, Biden\u2019s tax plan would make the tax code more progressive, with the vast majority of increased tax burdens and the entirety of direct tax increases falling on high-income households.\"\nThe group summarized four independent assessments of how Biden\u2019s tax plan would affect members of the lowest, second-lowest, middle, second-highest, and highest income quintiles. The four analyses were conducted by the American Enterprise Institute, the Tax Foundation, the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, and the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School.\n\nAs the chart indicates, the lowest 80% of the income spectrum would register small income losses as a result of Biden\u2019s tax proposal, typically about one-half of 1% of income, or in the range of a couple hundred dollars. For instance, according to the Tax Policy Center\u2019s analysis, the lowest income group would see their incomes drop by $30; the next would see a drop of $110; the middle would see a drop of $260; and the second-highest, with incomes up to $170,000, would see a loss of $590.\nBy contrast, the top one-fifth of earners would face a significantly bigger hit \u2014 a loss of somewhere between 2.3% and 5.7% of after-tax income in 2021. And the top 1% of earners would take the biggest hit of all, between 13% and 17.8% of after-tax income.\nOur ruling\nHaley said Biden and Harris \"want massive tax hikes on working families.\"\nIndependent tax analysts agree that the Biden plan would not directly raise taxes on any household earning below $400,000 a year, and it would pose small hits from the indirect impact of raising the corporate tax rate. The vast majority of the income losses from the Biden tax proposal would fall on the top one-fifth of incomes, and especially on the top 1%.\nAll in all, the indirect tax hikes on \"working families,\" such as they are, are not \"massive.\" We rate the statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17177"}
