Jon Tester, D-Mont., waded into Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s Supreme Court nomination and the millions of dollars that has been spent both for and against the would-be justice.\n\"Dark money is paying for over 80 percent of (Kavanaugh\u2019s) ads,\" Tester said in Sept. 29 debate. Tester has said he would vote against Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation.\nMuch of that funding has taken the form of \"dark money,\" which refers to political spending by unknown donors for the purpose of influencing public opinion.\nWe found no one who knows how much money in total has been spent in support of Kavanaugh's nomination. On top of that, the dark money groups aren't required in most cases to report their expenditures.\nBut many of those organizations like the publicitly and announce that they're spending millions to get Kavanaugh on the court. And those amounts are substantial.\nAmount of 'dark money' unknown\nTester\u2019s campaign pointed us to a slew of announcements\u00a0from eight groups that are funding pro-Kavanaugh ads.\u00a0Here\u2019s their tally as of Oct. 2:\n\n\n\n\nFunding for pro-Kavanaugh ads\n\n\n\n\nGroup\n\n\nAmount\n\n\n\n\nJudicial Crisis Network\n\n\n> $6 million\n\n\n\n\nGreat America Alliance\n\n\n~ $4.5 million\n\n\n\n\nAmerica First Policies\n\n\n~ $2 million\n\n\n\n\nNRA-ILA\n\n\n> $1 million\n\n\n\n\nAmericans for Prosperity\n\n\n> $1 million\n\n\n\n\nCitizens United\n\n\n> $250,000\n\n\n\n\n45Committee\n\n\n$650,000\n\n\n\n\nGreat America PAC\n\n\n$448,000\n\n\n\n\nTOTAL: ~ $15.84 million\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the possible exception of Great America PAC, none of these groups needs to disclose their donors or their expenditures.\nIn addition to data flagged by Tester\u2019s campaign, the Brennan Center for Justice compiled\u00a0data from\u00a0the Campaign Media Analysis Group, which tracks television ad buys in national markets. Here's their list of pro-Kavanaugh ads as of Oct. 3:\n\n\n\n\nKantar Media data (via Brennan Center for Justice; current as of Oct. 3)\n\n\n\n\nJudicial Crisis Network\n\n\n$3,692,730\n\n\n\n\nNRA-ILA\n\n\n$1,243,070\n\n\n\n\nAmerica First Policies\n\n\n$1,109,950\n\n\n\n\nState Government Leadership Foundation\n\n\n$473,230\n\n\n\n\nOne Nation\n\n\n$404,440\n\n\n\n\n45Committee\n\n\n$118,490\n\n\n\n\nCitizens United\n\n\n$27,490\n\n\n\n\nGreat America PAC\n\n\n$5,550\n\n\n\n\nTOTAL: $7.07 million\n\n\n\n\nTo be clear, this is an estimate of dark money spending.\nHowever, groups like the National Republican Congressional Committee have also spent on advertisements in support of Kavanaugh.\n\nSuch groups do have to disclose their donors and expenditures, but don't need to do so until the next deadline for the Federal Elections Commission.\u00a0That means\u00a0no one can put together a total ad budget favoring Kavanaugh.\nWithout those reports, no one can have a complete accounting of the pro-Kavanaugh ad spending.\nNevertheless, this type of spending played a significant role in\u00a0the Kavanaugh confirmation fight, said\u00a0Anna Massoglia, an analyst who tracks the flow of dark money at the Center for Responsive Politics.\u00a0\n\" 'Dark money' does make up a substantial portion of spending on the Supreme Court confirmation fight,\" she said. \"But I would be reluctant to classify all spending on Kavanaugh as 'dark money' due to the structure of some of the entities spending on ads.\"\nOur ruling\nTester said, \"Dark money is paying for over 80 percent of (Kavanaugh\u2019s) ads.\"\nWe did our best to tally up the outside spending on the Kavanaugh confirmation fight. But it\u2019s difficult if not impossible to conclusively say how much money is involved.\nExperts said dark money comprises a substantial portion of spending on the Supreme Court confirmation fight. It\u2019s even possible dark money makes up 80 percent or more of the overall share, as Tester said. But we simply can\u2019t be sure. Neither can Tester.
