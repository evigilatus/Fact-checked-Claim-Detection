Following additional reports, the judgement was revised to half correct and republished on 24 May. George Limeaux was raping to his former colleague, the Democrat Sin Bill Nelson, in recent videos and campaign sites. Lee Meaux, the Republican who was appointed by Goff at the time. (Charlie Christ) To fill the last 16 months in the Senate, he will be running for the Senate seat in 2012. In a recent video, Nelson criticized his support for health-care reform and amnesty for illegal immigrants. He also blew up Nelson to support him in plans like $225 million in Alaska. Limeo insisted that he never asked for a single allocation during the short period he had spent in the Senate (we gave this text half correct). Now, LeMieux linked Nelson to the Senate's failure to approve the regular annual budget. In a tweet on May 19, 2011, LeMieux wrote: \"750 days since Bill Nelson and the Democrats of the Senate approved a budget. How can this be justified?\" Has it really been two years since the Senate approved a budget? We decided to find out. We looked at the budget process first, then at what has happened in the past two years and finally at Nelson's role. We texted Lemox to ask him to explain more than 140 letters allowed by Twitter, but we didn't answer them. Background information on budget decisions to obtain background information on the meaning of \"budget overrun,\" we went on to the explanations already provided by our colleagues at Poletti Fact National. Today, Congress is pursuing a budget process based on the 1974 Congressional Budget Act. This process requires a budget decision, first by the Senate Budget Committee and then by the Senate as a whole. This decision, according to Jason Bouquet, the staff analyst of the responsible Federal Budget Committee, a bi-party public political think tank, is \"an internally binding document setting out for at least five fiscal years the total levels of appropriations and expenditures, federal revenues and the resulting surplus or budget deficit.\" Budget decisions are usually approved by the House of Representatives and the Senate in the spring. If the rooms do not agree, they work on a compromise. It is not a presentation if they do not approve the budget decision, because the actual allocation of money to all government departments and agencies is a separate process. If no decision is approved, it becomes a dialogue point for the minority party - in this case, for the Republicans. In fact, the President of the Florida Senate, Mike Harridopolous, also a candidate for the Senate in 2012, tweeted 19 May around 750 days. The inability to make a decision demonstrates disagreement in Congress and adversely affects the majority party. Vern Buchanan showed on April 27, 2010 in an online video. In the past 50 years, the federal government has balanced the budget only five times. \u2022 May 7, 2010, we should add two points. First, the budget decision is not a draft law. It summarizes Congress' intention, but it doesn't go to the president or require his signature. Second, the past two years are not the first time we have had difficulty getting an approved budget. Since 1983, the two chambers have been unable to pass a joint budget bill on four occasions. For fiscal year 2003, the Senate, under democratic control in 2002, did not issue a budget resolution of any kind. On three other occasions (fiscal years 1999, 2005 and 2007), the House of Representatives and the Senate failed to reconcile the various bills and adopt a compromise measure. In the last three cases, the Republicans formed the majority in the two houses of Congress. We turn to what has happened in the past two years. The Senate passed a budget resolution in 2009 for fiscal year 2010. The final action was 29 April 2009, according to a report on the budget process submitted by the Congressional Research Service. That vote was 53-43, with all Republicans and three Democrats voting against it. This was the last budget resolution adopted by the Senate. Quickly to May 19, 2011, that's exactly 750 days later. This is the time frame referred to by the LeMieux system. From the point of view of Democrats, the 2009 resolution included the budget for the year ending 30 September 2010. So Adam Gentelson, Deputy Director of Communications for Majority Leader Harry Reed, R-Nev., calls the 750-day number \"very misleading\" because it's only 231 days from the beginning of the fiscal year to LeMieux's tweet. Remember, though, what LeMieux said was 750 days since the Senate \"budged a budget,\" not \"since we've had a budget.\" So the number of days in the Lemox tweet is true. What was Nelson's role in the budget bargaining ever since? Nelson played his role in 2010 for the budget decision as a member of the Senate Budget Committee. \"In April 2010, that group approved in 12.10 a budget decision for the fiscal year 2011. \"Nelson voted for him,\" said Nelson Dan McLaughlin. \"Every member of the Limeux political party voted against it.\" In full Senate, the budget decision introduced in 2010 by the Chairman of Budget Committee S. Kent Conrad of North Dakota did not go anywhere. The Democrats (and two independents with whom they gathered) were in the majority at the time, 59-41, so they had 51 votes to approve the budget. If they have the votes, why didn't the Democrats succeed in a budget in 2010? We asked Gentelson in the majority president's office, Reid, to explain. \"At a time when democracy's highest priority was to create jobs and put our economy back on track, the Republicans were threatening to hijack the budget process and waste the time of the American people with useless political voices, even as our economy continued to struggle in the aftermath of the financial crisis,\" said Gentelson. In the face of this obstruction, we have decided that it will be a more productive use of the time of the American people to move forward and address other critical issues for middle-class families. For example, other laws enacted in 2010 cited at least little Republican support. He referred to a draft law on employment opportunities to provide incentives for companies to employ more workers, adopted on 17 March 68-29 with the support of 11 Republicans, including Limeux; another bill providing incentives for businesses, adopted on 16 September 2010 with the support of Limeux and another Republican; and the Dodd-Frank Financial System Reform Bill, approved 60-39 with the support of three Republicans. His point was that the total lack of the two parties in the budget would be detrimental to the prospects for further billing. Gentelson also indicates that voting on the budget is \"a completely open process of adjustment.\" Therefore, any senator can present any amendment -- and any number of amendments -- that will be considered relevant and require voting. The Democrats fear that, if they so choose, the Republicans will be able to use this method to block any budget vote. This explanation, though, does not wash with the Republicans, nor with Steve Ellis, the vice-president of the public sense taxpayers, an independent group that analyses federal spending. He says that budgets are historically biased, and he looked for the last four senatorial votes on them. The budget for fiscal year 2010 did not receive a single Republican vote in 2009. The 2009 and 2008 budgets were approved with only two Republican votes each. For fiscal year 2007, when Republicans controlled the Senate, none of the Democrats voted for it. His explanation for the lack of budget approval in 2010: policy. The Democrats didn't want to be seen as major spenders before the 2010 midterm elections, so they didn't vote at all. This year &apos; s 2012 budget, together with Republicans who control the House of Representatives and a larger minority in the Senate, the most visible budget plan for fiscal year 2012 comes from the Chairman of the Budget Committee of the House of Representatives, Paul Ryan. She passed home on April 15. It is expected that a vote will be taken in the Senate this month, as McLaughlin said. However, expectations are that the measure will fail in the Senate. Another major budget hope, expected from a bi-party group called \"Gang of Six,\" spread last week when a key member, Sin. Tom Coburn, R-Okla, retreated from the negotiations. The Chairman of the Budget Committee, Conrad, issued a statement on 19 May stating that the Democrats were about to reach an agreement but would be delayed \"because of the high-level bilateral party leadership negotiations currently under way.\" On the Republican side, Sin Jeff Seals, R-Ala and the Republican President of the Committee replied that \"Democracy keeps the majority in the Senate... Here are the talking points for fun again. What the analysts say we checked again with Peuquet of a responsible federal budget committee. He said, \"It's been 750 days technically since the Senate made the last budget decision.\" That made Democrats appear irresponsible, but they continued to allocate dollars as needed through other spending bills. \"But the bigger picture is that congressional and administrative legislators have not yet drawn up a long-term financial plan for debt stabilization and reduction,\" Bucket said. \"This is the true measure of financial responsibility, and there is a lot of blame for going all over both sides for why our financial expectations are so bad.\" Ellis, a payer of taxation for general sense, added: \"The blame for this (failure to pass the budget) is always on the feet of the majority - democracy or the republic. The majority rarely receive any support (from the minority) to settle their budgets; it is a party matter. So last year, democratic majorities were worried about the divisions in their grouping and talking about spending money. It was a waiver of responsibility. Ellis added: \"But saying it was Sen. Nelson's fault is a huge stretch. If he were the head of the budget or in command, it would be different.\" The number of days since the adoption of the Senate budget is 750, is correct. However, Limeaux's insinuation is that Nelson and the Democrats in the Senate get the full blame. The truth about the stalled budget process is that it is a function of party politics on both sides, not just Democrats in the Senate. We're assessing this claim half right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13046"}
