My \"friend\" (Sianche Jr.) and the Republican Daniel Harrob in the November general election to succeed Angel Taveras as mayor. Elorza made the granting of city contracts an issue in his campaign. He first made a claim that there were no contracts going to minorities and women on April 16 to his campaign website, which announced his proposal for \"equity in business opportunities.\" In that statement, he said that the figure was about 1%. Have you failed Providence to achieve its goal of awarding contracts to minorities and women? While we waited for the Elorza campaign to provide the basis for the claim, we found the city decree of 1990 setting out the objectives of minority and women &apos; s contracts. The law is actually more ambitious than what Eulda described. It aims at 10 per cent of minority contracts and 10 per cent for women, or a total of 20 per cent - twice the percentage mentioned by Elorza. Charles Newton, from Rhode Island Business, explained this to us. This was confirmed by the Taveras office. The decree indicates that in 1990 and in the previous two years, less than 1 per cent of contracts had been awarded to these companies. * (see chap. 21, art. II, arts. 21-52). When John Taraborelli, the spokesman for Elorza, returned to us, he said that the Elorza statement on the low percentage of contracts awarded to minorities and women was based on the 2013 story of Goo Kanibrov. This story reviewed the minutes of all meetings of the Providence Council on Contracts and Supplies held from January 1 to 31 December 2012. Of the $185.8 million awarded in contracts in 2012, only $1.6 million - less than 1 per cent - went to companies owned by minorities, according to the story. Taraborelli also said that the campaign was followed by Brian Hall, Director of Municipal and Intergovernmental Affairs of Providence. Hal said that the analysis of the 2012 figures was accurate, according to Taraborelli. On January 18, 2021 in the Committee &apos; s discussion. The United States is the only industrial country that has been modernized and does not already have a paid family medical leave programme. First, warnings. Not all city contracts go to the board of contracts and supplies. The Board reviews and authorizes the purchase of $5,000 or more from the city. Anything less than $5,000 will be tendered by city administrations, and therefore these small contracts are not included in the Board's records. In addition, in order to be considered to be owned by minorities or women, businesses must be certified by the State. However, not all businesses that may be eligible have decided to go through the certification process, which, as Hal said, could be lengthy. If these non-dependent companies obtain contracts in the city, they are not accounted for as belonging to minorities or women. Now for the updated number. After Mayor Taveras took office in 2011, his administration formed a task force to increase the number of contracts awarded to minority companies, and studied innovative procurement programmes in other cities, including San Antonio, Texas and Bridgeport, Conn. These efforts have resulted in an increase. For 2013, contracts awarded by the Board of Contracts and Supplies for minority-owned or women-owned businesses accounted for 2.3 per cent of purchases of $208 million that year, according to analysis by the Hale Office. This is about three times the corresponding figure of 0.8 per cent for 2012. To put Providence's number in perspective, we spoke to Newton, Assistant Director of Rhode Island Minority Business, the government agency with minority business. The State requires 10 per cent of all purchases to businesses by minorities or women. This share is currently between 4.5 and 5 per cent, according to Newton. Our Governor, George Elorza, said that Providence was aiming to give 10 per cent of city contracts to businesses owned by minorities or women, but in fact less than 1 per cent of contracts go to such companies. Elorza made a mistake in obtaining both parts of the claim. In fact, the target is 10 per cent for minorities and 10 per cent for women, a total of 20 per cent. The latest figures indicate that in 2013, 2.3 per cent of city contracts went to minorities, more than double the old figure cited by Elorza in 2012. The difference in the 2012 and 2013 figures is significant when the figures are seen for each other. However, despite an increase, 2.3 per cent is still well below the 20 per cent target. The larger point of Elorza -- that the city needs to act strongly if it wants to achieve policy objectives in how to award contracts -- may be true, but the numbers it uses to support that claim are too far away.
