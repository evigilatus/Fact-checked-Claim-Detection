Wallace then asked: \"What about Gov. (Rick) Perry's argument that it's better to get these kids an education and to get them jobs than to consign them just to being a burden on the state?\"\n\n\"It's an argument I just can't follow,\" Romney replied. \"I've got be honest with you, I don't see how it is that a state like Texas -- to go to the University of Texas, if you're an illegal alien, you get an in-state tuition discount.\"\n\nIn advance of the debate, we were reviewing another presidential aspirant\u2019s claim about the Texas law. In the Sept. 12 debate in Tampa, former U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum said Perry had \"provided in-state tuition for -- for illegal immigrants. Maybe that was an attempt to attract the illegal vote -- I mean, the Latino voters. But you attract Latino voters by talking about the importance of immigration in this country.\"\n\nSetting aside whether Santorum equated illegal immigrants with Latino Americans, did Perry give a tuition break to people who are in the U.S. illegally?\n\nPerry responded: \"In the state of Texas, if you've been in the state of Texas for three years, if you're working towards your college degree, and if you are working and pursuing citizenship in the state of Texas, you pay in-state tuition there. ... And I'm proud that we are having those individuals be contributing members of our society rather than telling them, \u2018You go be on the government dole.\u2019 \"\n\nIndeed, as we noted in a 2010 fact check, Perry proudly signed into law on June 16, 2001, a proposal allowing certain illegal immigrants to attend Texas colleges and universities at in-state tuition rates. Undocumented immigrants with a Texas high school diploma or GED who have lived in Texas for at least three years may qualify for in-state tuition if they sign an affidavit saying they intend to apply for permanent residency as soon as they can.\n\nFrom 2002 to 2010, according to the coordinating board, 35,200 students used the affidavit method to attend Texas colleges or universities at in-state tuition rates.The annual number of beneficiaries rose from 733 in 2002 to 16,476 in 2010, according to the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board.\n\nAnd \"affidavit\" students pay far less than what they\u2019d pay as non-residents. On average in 2011, a non-resident, full-time student would be expected to pay an estimated $17,000 in tuition and fees, according to Texas public universities, while an in-state resident would be paying $7,200.\n\nTexas isn\u2019t alone with such a provision. Nationally, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 13 states passed such proposals into law in the wake of the 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act. Signed by President Clinton, the act sought to prevent states from giving an in-state tuition benefit to illegal immigrants that is not available to legal residents.\n\nLegislatures in Texas, California and other states responded with measures intended to preserve in-state tuition for some illegal immigrants. Other states banned illegal immigrants from getting in-state tuition rates; Indiana passed such a law last month, as the Indianapolis Star reported Aug. 31.\n\nIn Texas, lawmakers approved House Bill 1403 with few \"no\" votes. After signing it into law, Perry said in a speech to the Southwest Voters Registration Education Project that he approved it \"so that young Texans who graduated from our public schools, regardless of their immigration status, will be able to pay in\u2011state tuition and take part in the Texas Dream. We want bright, new Texans to stay here, and contribute great things to our future.\"\n\nSix years later, Perry opposed an attempt to repeal the measure, telling the Houston Chronicle: \"I\u2019m for leaving the law like it is because I think it serves a good purpose.\" He reiterated his support during the 2010 Texas gubernatorial campaign.\n\nPerry\u2019s comments at the Sept. 12 and Sept. 22 debates aligned with his previously supportive statements.\n\nAll told, Perry isn\u2019t solely responsible for the Texas law enabling illegal immigrants to qualify for in-state tuition, but he signed it into existence and has stood by it. We rate Santorum\u2019s claim as True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-12384"}
