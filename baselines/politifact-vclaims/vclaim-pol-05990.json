They\u2019ve done more damage to our economy than any recession ever did. Labor Day should be replaced by Patriots Day, celebrated every year on 9/11.\"\nThe meme indicates Walker said this on Sept. 5, 2015.\nOnly he didn\u2019t.\nTo be sure, Walker is no fan of organized labor, but there is no evidence he made such a statement. To the contrary, a closer look shows the meme was created by a group that mocks conservatives called \"Stop the World, the Teabaggers Want Off.\"\nDig even deeper and you find a disclaimer that says the site is meant to be satire.\nThey\u2019re old pros at creating this kind of stuff -- and having readers unwittingly pass it around as if it is the truth. This Walker-focused meme has been shared some 2,800 times on Facebook.\nThe \"Stop the World\" site is not new to PolitiFact readers. Our partners in other states have reviewed other fake statements involving GOP presidential contenders.\nMarco Rubio: PolitiFact Florida looked at a quote attributed to U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida: \"No, felons should not have their voting rights restored even after they have served their sentence.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was no evidence that Rubio had actually said the words attributed to him, although he has been critical about felons regaining voting rights. The claim was rated False.\nTed Cruz: PolitiFact Texas looked at a meme that claimed U.S. Ted Cruz said this: \"While there may have been an age difference, Josh Duggar\u2019s transgressions are far less an affront to God than what gays do to each other.\"\nDuggar, a reality TV star, resigned from the conservative Family Research Council after reports that he had sexually assaulted several girls, including two of his sisters, when he was 14.\nPolitiFact Texas rated the claim that Cruz had made the comment Pants on Fire.\nThe myth-busting site Snopes has looked at a number of other outlandish fake quotes attributed to conservatives, including Sarah Palin, \"Duck Dynasty\" star Phil Robertson and former GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney. All were made up.\n(Snopes has declared the Walker meme false.)\nIndeed, the group got more than the alleged Walker quote wrong. It also mixed up Patriot\u2019s Day (April 19), which marks the first battles of the Revolutionary War, with Patriot Day, which is Sept. 11 -- the day of the terrorist attacks on the United States.\nOur rating\nA Facebook meme attributed a fake quote to Gov. Scott Walker saying Labor Day should be replaced by Patriots Day. Walker never said such a thing, and this site has a track record of falsely attributing statements to conservatives.\nWe rate the claim Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05990"}
