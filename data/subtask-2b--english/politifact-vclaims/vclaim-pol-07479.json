Steve won\u2019t.\"\nA Martinez backer, Jose Velasquez, asked us to check Sepulveda\u2019s claim.\n\nWe wondered first if perhaps laws have changed dramatically so that Texas candidates may accept corporate donations.\nNot so, we were reminded, in that Texas adopted its ban on corporate donations to candidates more than a century ago.\nA September 2013 Texas Ethics Commission guide for candidates for local office specified that state law bars contributions to candidates for state and local office from labor unions and most corporations. More recently, Austin lawyer Tim Sorrells, the commission\u2019s former general counsel, advised candidates for city office in an April 2, 2014, blog post: \"In Texas, it is still a felony of the third degree for a corporation or labor organization to contribute directly to a candidate or a candidate committee.\"\nWe asked Sepulveda, a social entreprenuer and philanthropist, to elaborate on his Facebook statement. By email, he told us: \"I should have said Mike was taking money from business entities. I was referring to his acceptance of contributions from LLCs as well as PACs and bundlers.\" LLCs are Limited Liability Companies.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 23, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBiden invested the entire family fortune in Ukraine gas and oil.

Starting to get the picture.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"My bad for not being more specific,\" Sepulveda wrote. In another email, he said that when Velasquez asked him about the corporate claim, \"I used the term corporate generically, even referring him to the documents filed with the city clerk. If I'd been trying to mislead anyone, I certainly wouldn't have pointed them to the candidate-filed reports.\"\nSepulveda, who said he made his Facebook comments as an Adler supporter and not as a spokesman for Adler\u2019s campaign, elaborated that according to a campaign-finance filing, Martinez fielded contributions from 13 businesses, which we confirmed from Martinez\u2019s July 15, 2014, campaign finance report, which showed the cited contributions ranging from $50 to $350.\nWe noticed the business contributors included several limited liability companies, which prompted us to ask an election-law expert, Trey Trainor of Austin, if such companies can legally give to candidates for local office. By phone, Trainor said LLCs may legally make donations so long as none of their members are corporations. Also by phone, Austin lawyer Ed Shack, who said he has helped Adler\u2019s campaign, said the same.\nMartinez campaign spokesman Nick Hudson told us the campaign earlier confirmed from state records and by contacting each contributor that none of the LLCs giving to Martinez\u2019s effort had corporate members. Hudson agreed it would be illegal for Martinez to accept corporate donations.\nMeanwhile, Sepulveda replied to us that he had since posted a comment on Facebook, below his original claim, stating he should have said Martinez accepted donations from business entities including LLCs rather than corporations. It appeared the afternoon of Aug. 4, 2014.\n\nOur ruling\nSepulveda said on Facebook that Martinez takes corporate donations.\nThat\u2019s not so. In fact, corporate donations remain forbidden and accepting such could lead to a felony charge. However, any candidate may field contributions from PACs and LLCs (so long as a donor LLC has no corporate members).\nThis advocate\u2019s claim, which he clarified on Facebook six days later, shakes out as incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!\n\nPANTS ON FIRE \u2013 The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07479"}
