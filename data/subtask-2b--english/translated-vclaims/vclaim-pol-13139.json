Herb Cole says he didn't have any negative campaign.", "text": "After 23 years of senatorship, Herb Cole in Wisconsin did not announce whether he would seek another six-year term in 2012. But as the Republicans escalate their criticism of him, Cole clearly illustrates his contempt for some kind of harsh and troubled campaign environment that will almost certainly be part of another campaign. In comparison to his recent races, when Cole used his enormous personal wealth to vanquish under-funded opponents with cheap television commercials, it would be a new environment for the Senator, who owns Milwaukee Bucks and builds Cole's department and grocery chains. In remarks to journalists in Madison on April 28, 2011, Cole reported on the status of today's campaigns. He said, \"People don't like anyone in public life\" because of the \"crazy\" attacks and the sniper among members of Congress, something he said was involved in \"hardly at all.\" He then specifically said, \"I've been through four campaigns and I haven't done any negative campaigns. And I don't engage in any personal duel with other people in public life. But that's my style.\" So did Cole avoid any negative campaign? This is a clear claim in this era of aggressive tactics and mud making. We decided to check it out. Of course, it would be impossible to track every campaign statement made by Cole since 1988 and copies of television ads decades ago. So we focused our look back on the media descriptions of television spots, debates and candidate strategies in his four races. We also spoke to people who should know the best: many of his former opponents or associates, Cole campaign staff, and a long-time political journalist. Cole has, of course, benefited from the negative attacks by groups supporting his campaigns, but he has spoken only of the conduct of his campaigns, so we will limit our review to that. There is another observation before we begin: because there is no universally accepted definition of what constitutes a \"negative\" campaign, we asked the Cole team exactly what it meant to demand. Mr. Cole said that he believed that the campaign was about telling the people of Wisconsin what he had done and what he was planning to do, not destroying his opponent or telling people not to vote for them. \"It was neither malicious nor dishonest in his campaigns nor during his public service service\" In fact, his last opponent said that there were no negative campaigns in their competitions - and he had great praise for Cole. \"He didn't do anything negative in his campaign. John Gillespie, founder of the Rohyd Boys farm, who lost to Cole in 2000. Say hello to Herb if you talk to him. Tell him I owe him dinner.\" Robert Lorge, Cole's competitor, said in 2006. Fair enough. That was a landslide victories. What about previous competitions? 1988: Cole was a surprise participant in the democratic primary elections, and won a comfortable nomination over the previous government. Tony Earl, Ed Garvey, Doug La Voulette. He foiled his rival by limiting his participation in the debate and spending millions on television commercials. At that time, the media adviser to Earl David Axelrod accused that Cole's popular slogan -- \"No one senator but you\" -- was an implicit negative attack. This implies that candidates who - unlike Cole - must collect most of their campaign money are fans of donors, as Axelrod said, who later went to help a man named Barack Obama get an elected president. Earl attacked Cole as unmarked and prone to error, prompting Cole's campaign assistant Bill Christopherson to call Earl \"desperate\" and guilty of discrediting him. Internalists on both sides agree that Cole does not run offensive announcements at the primary stage -- and nothing in the very narrow general elections that saw Republic State Bill Susan Engileter close the gap to just a few points with a series of ads targeting Cole in recent weeks. Angeleter herself told us that she has \"nothing but positive memories\" of a lovely friendly campaign. She also commended Cole for dealing with her when she was later confirmed to be the manager of the United States Small Business Department. Lafolet and Garvey say today that they won't say that Cole's main race is negative. With regard to Cole's motto, Lafolet agreed with Cole Aid Christopherson, who said: \"Herb Cole was talking about himself, not about anyone else, when he promised to be 'no one senator but you.\" In fact, Cole explicitly used his campaign declarations as a selling point, describing his victory as a blow against negative campaigns. 1994: In his first re-election campaign, Cole wasted a little time filming Republican opponent Robert Welch, a Redgranet lawman, as a \"large conservative\" and volatile. In an early discussion, he cited Welch's position of no exception to abortion and vowed never to vote for tax increases as \"extremist.\" According to media accounts, he did not explain the charge of volatility. After that, Welsh told the reporters that Cole was worse than I thought. Later, after Welch tried to link Cole to President Clinton, Cole launched a rare television commercial focusing on a named opponent. It was followed by someone else. Wilch's ads were accused of distorting Cole's record. One said that \"the Virgin Republics\" criticized Welch's tactics - something that was misleading in examining the facts of the Milwaukee newspaper. The exchange led Welsh to accuse Cole of running a multimillion-dollar mud campaign. Cole said it was Welsh who got negative. He warmed up the speech. At some point in the race, after Wilch Cole was accused of \"battering with religion,\" the spokesman for Cole Geoffrey Gillis said that \"Wilch's attack again shows that he will say or do anything to get an election.\" So, that sounds like a little bit of dagger. But looking back, the director of the Welch Mike Maxwell campaign doesn't have strong views about going back and forth. \"I don't know that Cole was particularly negative through those elections,\" he told us. He didn't remember Cole's \"mutilation\" announcement. He said that some might consider the charge of \"greatness\" to be a negative attack. Cole, Maxwell recalled that he had enormous resources, and then Box signed off on the first-round draft resolution, Glen Robinson, six days before the election. (We could not reach Welch for comment.) Kenneth Lamkie, Milwaukee Sentinel's reporter who covered the 1994 race, offered the strongest opinion we heard about whether Cole went downside against Welsh. He says yes. Lamk said that Cole's \"greatness\" charge was \"within limits but not unique to Herb.\" Lamek considered the attack unjustified and excessive; Gillis, Assistant Cole, said that he had responded to the drums &apos; banging Cole during the presidential presidential election. We must note that Lamk asked us to describe his personal policy as \"the birthright of the Republicans.\" We asked many politicians to describe Cole's language. They responded with caution because we were not able to make the same announcement, just direct quotations from it in media accounts. That makes it impossible to judge the entire tone. Professor Vanderbilt John Gere, author of a very excited book on negative campaigns, said that it seemed like an announcement of a \"tom\" response -- \"not this kind of classic negative advertising that the public does not like.\" Daryl West, Brookings Institution, agreed. He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. On January 12, 2021, Ken Goldstein UW-Madison Qen Goldstein said that Cole's announcement met the definition of \"negative\" academic research because he focused on Welch, not Cole. The test of whether that was unfair was whether it was accurate. So Cole's campaigns were remarkably low-profile, with the most notable exception of 1994, the first time - perhaps only - that Cole had broadcast television programs that were chasing an opponent. How does Cole do on his statement that he has never had a negative campaign? It's obvious that Cole spent most of his time and money in optimistic positive advertising. Even his opponents strongly agree with that -- so that one wants to buy him dinner. The only declaration that appears to be negative is the \"Chuh\" spot of 1994 against Welch. I've attracted some attention, but it's seen as a very offensive response announcement. Moreover, Cole's campaigns were involved in some naming and name. In 1994, Cole's negative portrayal of the aggressive Luillich as a \"extremist\" was negative. Cole's mostly on target here, with some minor exceptions. It's mostly true.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13139"}
