(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nWe found no evidence that the suspect loved Obama.\nThe story falsely said that \"Dimitrius Pagopogouritz is a liberal whose immigrant parents raised him on welfare in the projects of San Dimas.\" The story invented a \"leaked interview with police\" in which the suspect \"admitted he was an Obama-loving moonbat who was looking to \u2018end gun violence\u2019 by adding another shooting.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on February 8, 2021 in a Newsmax TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOnly one person died on that day\u201d during the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 February 9, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first sign that this is made up is that the suspect\u2019s name is wrong; his actual name is Dimitrios Pagourtzis.\nThe story also makes up all sorts of ridiculous details, including that suspect\u2019s father is serving a life sentence for stealing \"6,000 pounds of tainted turkey bacon.\"\nLaw enforcement has not released information about a motive for the mass shooting that left 10 people dead. The mother of one victim\u00a0said that her daughter had recently turned down the advances of the boy.\nThe Daily World Update is linked to a frequent purveyor of hoaxes, Christopher Blair, who says he creates fake stories to make money. While Blair identifies The Daily World Update as satire, other blogs often pick up Blair\u2019s stories without the satire asterisk. \u00a0\nFake accounts imitating the suspect on Facebook also depicted him wearing a hat showing support for Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential bid, with a background photo displaying a banner espousing anti-fascists, or Antifa, views.\nThe Daily World headline said, \"Breaking: Santa\u00a0Fe killer expresses his love for Obama.\" We found no evidence that the suspect declared his love for Obama.
