She was 6 at the time.\nNunn declined to talk to PolitiFact Georgia about the claim.\nBut she has talked with the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and national media about her childhood plenty, even before announcing her candidacy.\nIn several AJC stories, including a 1992 Father\u2019s Day piece, Nunn says she grew up in the Washington, D.C. area.\nA January, 2014 New York Times story describes her as quipping that she moved \"against my will,\" when she was 6 and her family relocated to Maryland.\nThe same article notes Nunn lived in the Capital region during high school, when she played basketball at the all-girls National Cathedral School.\nThose reports are accurate, said Nunn spokesman Nathan Click.\nSo is the biography listed on her official campaign website, which notes only that she was born near the family\u2019s Perry farm, he said.\n\"While the bio that appears on the campaign's website and is widely utilized by the campaign correctly characterizes Michelle's biographical facts, a separate document that appeared on some event invitations failed to properly do so,\" Click said in a statement.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven though the fundraiser was the most high-profile to date in Nunn\u2019s race against Republican businessman Perdue, that might be the end of it: a bio not properly vetted before publication.\nBut another Nunn misstep, the leak of confidential campaign strategy memos this summer, brings up another point.\nThe memos point out that Nunn should anticipate certain attacks, among them that she is \"not a \u2018real\u2019 Georgian.\"\nCandidates, and voters, move in and out of the state all the time, so it\u2019s unclear how much of a negative that would really be, said Kerwin Swint, chairman of the political science department at Kennesaw State University.\nPerdue, for instance, has a television ad airing outside of metro Atlanta, that says he \"grew up working his family\u2019s farm in middle Georgia. \" The spot \u00a0doesn\u2019t mention that the 64-year-old spent much of his working life outside the state, in places such as Massachusetts, Tennessee and Hong Kong.\nBut the leaked memos could open up Nunn to attack for being disingenuous, Swint said.\n\"Newt Gingrich is from Pennsylvania for heaven\u2019s sake,\" he said. \"Ordinarily it wouldn\u2019t be that big of a story, but it is because of the intense publicity from the leak.\"\nLeslie Shedd, spokeswoman for the division of the Georgia GOP known as Georgia Victory, said the issue is not where Nunn grew up but why any biography would counter already-published facts.\n\"To me, it\u2019s not an issue that she didn\u2019t spend her entire life in Georgia,\" Shedd said. \"Why does she feel the need to essentially lie about it?\"\nBased on the explanation from the Nunn camp, and the ease to find biographical information on her, Swint said it appears the bio was an inadvertent, not intentional mistake.\nClick described Nunn as a ninth-generation Georgian, who kept ties to Perry by spending holidays and summers at the family farm.\nNunn herself, in the New York Times piece, said her father constantly reminded her that she was \"from Georgia.\"\nNunn has lived in Atlanta since 1989, after graduating from the University of Virginia at 23.\nChildhood, by any reasonable definition, ends at least at age 18. And the facts are clear: Nunn spent 12 of those years living outside of Georgia.\nEven accounting for summer vacations and holidays, any claim that she spent \"most\" of her childhood here is inconsistent with the facts.\nNunn\u2019s campaign admits it made a mistake with its statement, and there are multiple instances of her acknowledging her move from Georgia.\nNunn did spend part of her childhood in Georgia, but certainly not most of it.\nWe rate the invitation claim Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07282"}
