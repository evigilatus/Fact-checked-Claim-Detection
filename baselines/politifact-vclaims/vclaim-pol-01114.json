But other viewers were more intrigued by the art decorating her kitchen cabinet.\n\"Racist much?\" says a Jan. 16 Facebook post on the New York City Republicans page that shows a photo of Warren in front of the cabinet alongside a figurine of an offensive caricature of a black boy eating a watermelon. One of the pieces on her cabinet is circled in yellow, suggesting that it\u2019s the racist art in question.\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) A message PolitiFact sent to the New York City Republicans Facebook account about the image was not immediately answered. However, the pictures appeared online elsewhere more than week earlier.\n\"Does Elizabeth Warren have blackface statues in her home!??\" asks one Jan. 4 post on Reddit. That same day, Tomi Lahren, a Fox News contributor, tweeted a similar picture (that has since been deleted). \"Am I seeing this correctly?\" she said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot according to Warren.
