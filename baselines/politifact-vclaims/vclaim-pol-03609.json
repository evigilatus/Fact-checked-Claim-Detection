The site describes itself as a source of insurance industry news for minority communities.\nThe story, which is made up as well as outdated, says Porter called President Barack Obama a \"fake president\" and referred to the Civil War as \"the War of Northern Aggression.\" In addition to the quote in the headline, the post claims Porter also said, \"I don\u2019t want my grandkids growing up taking orders from a colored man. It\u2019s our God-given right to keep them as property and keep them in line.\"\nThe Associated Press described Porter in 2013 as having \"a penchant for bold statements.\" He told NRA supporters before officially taking office that they were part of a \"culture war\" that was bigger than just gun rights. Porter was succeeded as NRA president in 2015 by Allan Cors.\nThe BlackInsuranceNews.com post was flagged by Facebook as possibly being fake as part of the social media company\u2019s efforts to weed out fake stories in its news feeds.\nThe BlackInsuranceNews.com story was very popular on Facebook. It\u2019s been shared more than 68,000 times since being posted Monday, according to Facebook.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it actually originates from a joke site called FreeWoodPost.com, which first posted the story on May 5, 2013, the same week Porter was installed as NRA president.\nFreeWoodPost.com makes no secret that its contents aren\u2019t serious. The site\u2019s slogan is \"News that\u2019s almost reliable,\" and each post (including the one about Porter) notes beneath the text that \"this story is satire, folks.\"\nThe site also has a disclaimer that says FreeWoodPost.com \"is a news and political satire web publication, which may or may not use real names, often in semi-real or mostly fictitious ways.\" The articles \"are fiction, and presumably fake news,\" it says.\nBlackInsuranceNews.com, meanwhile, carries no such disclaimer.
