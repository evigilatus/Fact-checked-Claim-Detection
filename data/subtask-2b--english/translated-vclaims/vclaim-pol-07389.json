They said that Lemon was confused, and his exchange with Governor Ben Ferguson &apos; s radio host on 20 August 2014 was embarrassing. It started when Lemon aired live from Ferguson, Moe, who said he supported the second amendment but doubted that the founding fathers were thinking of automatic weapons when they wrote them. Ferguson refired. \"Let's deal with the facts here,\" said Ferguson. \"A semi-automatic weapon is a weapon you or me are allowed to possess and in different places they have different rules. But the suggestion that anyone can go out and buy an automatic weapon isn't true, Don.\" \"What do you mean?\" Lemon said... \"During the shooting of the theatre in Colorado, I was able to go and buy an automatic weapon, and I probably shot a weapon three or four times in my life. I don't live in Colorado. I think most people can go out and buy an automatic weapon.\" This verification of the zero truth in Lemon's claim that \"most people can come out and buy an automatic weapon.\" The gun Lemon bought from Colorado was R-15. The copy sold by Bushmaster is described as semi-automatic. When Ferguson pointed out the difference between a full automatic weapon and a semi-automatic weapon, Lemon refused to distinguish as a matter of significance. \"The automatic weapon is something you can shoot a number of bullets very quickly,\" said Lemon. This is not the legal definition of an automatic weapon, but this discussion draws the curtain on a couple of wrinkles in what federal law says and does not say. For starters, the law fails to define the term \"a robot.\" The Arms Control Act 1968 defines a semi-automatic rifle as \"any repeat rifle that uses part of the launch cartridge energy to extract the fire cartridge and the next firing chamber, which requires a separate pull of the trigger to launch each cartridge.\" The main part there is the \"segregated pull of the trigger.\" Pull one = one shot. The law clearly speaks of its meaning in semi-automatic terms. When it comes to the term \"automatic,\" a simple conclusion is required. The National Firearms Act 1934 defines a machine gun as \"any weapon that shoots, is designed to fire, or can easily be recovered to fire, automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by means of one trigger function.\" Note this part about more than one shot by \"one job of trigger.\" Pull one = many shots. This is the legal difference between a semi-automated weapon and a complete automatic weapon. The AR-15 purchased by Lemon was semi-automatic. People can go out and buy such weapons in many shops across the country. The entire purchase of an automatic weapon is a very different and more restricted process, which we will enter shortly. But it's interesting that while the legal definition of machine guns speaks of automatic firing, there is no definition of automatic weapon per se. We asked the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and two senior legal experts on federal weapons laws. No one can refer to the legal language, court judgement or federal rule that makes machine guns automatically interchangeable, although in practice they are. Yes, you can buy a Greg Kelly machine gun on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Paden is on the video \"According to\" electoral fraud in \"Acknowledging.\" By Bill McCarthy: January 12, 2021, during the exchange between Lemon and Ferguson, Ferguson said, \"The majority of ordinary citizens are not allowed to possess full automatic weapons. Stephen Howard was a lawyer and firearms expert based in Lansing, Mitch. Howard said that the ban on machine guns was not as complete as Ferguson's words might seem. \"Most people can buy machine guns in many states,\" said Howard. \"But, this is one of those classic big 'but', they have to get through background checks by the FBI which is comprehensive as if you're getting a permit to become a federal agent.\" Howard said those checks could take six months. States like California, Iowa, and Kansas, prohibit private ownership under any circumstances. But in about half the country, including Florida and Texas, if you pay the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms $200 and have a clean record free of any history of domestic violence or felony conviction, you can legally get yourself a machine gun. However, Joseph Olson, who recently retired as Professor of Law at Hamlin University, and a former member of the Board of Directors of the National Guns Association, said that he would not be new. \"There was a freeze put on them in 1986,\" said Olsen. The New Jersey Representative (William) Hughes had an amendment limiting it to the one that was registered at the time. There's just under 300,000 in circulation.\" Since the main legal difference between semi-automated weapon and machine gun is whether pulling the trigger will fire one or more bullets, it should be noted that government regulators have approved devices that allow a gun such as AR-15 to fire many bullets at great speed, when added to the gun. It's called baked stocks, or motor stimuli. The fishing supplier Kabila is offering a so-called slide fire. \"The convergence of your fun with this safe and innovative inventory AR-15, which uses trauma technology to fire at the required speed,\" says the retailer on his website. Videos show shooters passing through a video after a clip of ammunition. Howard said that while the shooting rate simulates a machine gun, the mechanism is different. \"If you slowly pull the trigger, the bounce causes the gun to jump back and forth,\" said Howard. \"That's why the trigger's pulled.\" According to government standards, this retains the role of human intervention for every shot fired. Howard said that the effects of the shooting engines are less than the eye can see. He said they fail easily and make it difficult to aim the weapon. Howard said: \"People don't use them for crimes because you have to use them very carefully.\" However, there are enthusiastic reviews on Cabela &apos; s website. The buyer who calls himself \"Fride Joe\" wrote, \"This is a very interesting addition to your A/R. The only problem is the amount of missiles you're going through. I've been through 300 in two days. When you're really good at using this product, you can empty a 30-round video in a second. Wonderful!\" Lemon C.N. said that that rules us that people can go out to buy an automatic weapon. Lemon spoke as if the gun he bought was automatic. It wasn't. It was semi-automatic, which means that each shot requires a separate pull of the trigger. The ease of purchase that Lemon described applies to semi-automatic weapons. The legal status and availability of semi-automatic and fully automated weapons are quite different. Lemon was also incorrect when he did not revise his language and insisted that discrimination was merely a matter of connotations. In some states, access to machine guns is prohibited, while in others more stringent regulation is regulated. We appreciate Lemon's false claim.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07389"}
