Oswald is a professor in the Department of Molecular Medicine at Cornell.\nThe post claims researchers have found that \"COVID-19 was imaginary and fictitious.\"\n\n(Screenshot from Facebook)\n\"I have a PhD in virology and immunology. I'm a clinical lab scientist and have tested 1500 \u2018supposed\u2019 positive Covid 19 samples collected here in S.

He\u00a0did not write the text attributed to him \u2014 the text has been copied and pasted in social media posts and blog comments since at least Dec. 3. Oswald debunked the post in a statement on his faculty page.\nCOVID-19 is not a hoax \u2014 and it wasn\u2019t a plot orchestrated by China, as the post claims.\n\"COVID-19 is real,\" Oswald wrote in his statement. \"Any Facebook post that suggests otherwise is a hoax and is not true.\"\u00a0\nMany researchers have isolated the full genome of the coronavirus, which has killed more than 332,000 Americans and sickened more than 19 million. To claim the virus is a hoax is inaccurate and ridiculous.\nWe rate the Facebook post Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17316"}
