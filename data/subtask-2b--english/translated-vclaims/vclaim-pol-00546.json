During the morning of Joe on MSNBC, De Plasio was asked about income inequality in New York City. He said, \"We've made a lot of progress in New York.\" \"We have brought hundreds of thousands of people out of poverty in the past five years.\" De Blasieu asks the basic democratic voters to see his record as evidence of his effectiveness, and we wondered, have hundreds of thousands of people in New York City been pushed out of poverty in the last five years, as he claims? We approached his campaign to get evidence of his claim, and Olivia Laberelli's spokesman gave us a report from the city. The report, released in May, is the New York City Government &apos; s measure of poverty for the year 2012, prepared by the Mayor &apos; s Office for Economic Opportunities. Report issued a decade ago by Mayor Michael Bloomberg In 2008, using a proposal from the National Academy of Sciences, the city developed a more comprehensive methodology for measuring poverty. It measures poverty differently from the official poverty measure of the United States Census Bureau. By calculating the cost of living - such as housing, childcare and medical expenses - the city found more people living in poverty than the Federal Government reported, either when the measure began or in the city's most recent report. In 2008, the editorial board of The New York Times wrote about Bloomberg's efforts \"created a more realistic vision of life in the city.\" The standards and methods developed during the Bloomberg administration continued under De Blasieu, according to Christine Morse, who worked on poverty management under Bloomberg, and is now the Executive Director of the New School New York City Center. \"I don't think there's any question that this is an effective way to measure poverty,\" said Morse. The city &apos; s methodology also considers the value of benefits such as food and heating assistance as income. This year, the city reported that the number of people living in poverty or on the verge of poverty in 2017 was 236,500 less than if the poverty rate remained at the 2013 level. De Blacio took office in 2014. The percentage of New Yorkers living in poverty fell from 20.7 per cent in 2013 to 19 per cent in 2017, according to the city. This is approximately 140,000 people living in poverty, using the city &apos; s definition of poverty. The decline was evident among demographic subgroups, such as race and ethnicity, educational attainment and geography, but not all subgroups. The poverty rate also declined between 2013 and 2017, according to the official poverty measure set by the New York City Census Office. The city defines \"near poverty\" as those living at or below the 150% poverty threshold in New York City. The city &apos; s poverty threshold in 2017 was $33,562 for a family of adults and two children. The near poverty threshold is $50,343. The poverty rate neared 45.9 per cent in 2013 fell to 43.1 per cent in 2017, according to the city. Colin Schmidt stated on January 14, 2021 at a press conference \"We have scientific data, from all levels, but especially from high school sports levels, from many different states that show that it's safe to play what New York is thinking of doing high-risk sports.\" From 2013 to 2017, the minimum wage rose from $7.25 to $11 per hour. The effects of the minimum hourly wage of $15, which came into effect in 2019, are not reflected in this report. We have reached out to six experts studying poverty, many of whom are working in New York City, and everyone has agreed that poverty in New York City has declined. Nor did it raise any specific objections to the way in which the City of New York measured poverty; some even praised the city &apos; s methodology. They also said that the city &apos; s results on poverty rates were in line with their own research or other measures they had studied. Who's to be commended? But some experts questioned whether De Blacio could take credit. How to measure how city policies helped people out of poverty, and they asked, noting that poverty rates were declining throughout the country. In fact, the national poverty rate using the official poverty measure developed by the United States Census Bureau and its complementary measure of poverty declined steadily between 2014, the year in which De Blacio took office, and 2017. Greg Axe, Vice-President of the Income and Benefits Policy of the Urban Institute, said several factors affecting the poverty rate, such as philatelic benefits and income tax exemption, both federal programmes. Local initiatives in New York also help, such as raising the minimum wage and the global BC. He warned, however, that \"a strong claim\" that the actions of the city had led to poverty reduction. Morse said that De Plasio initiatives were important, called paid leave, comprehensive leave before retirement, and an increase in the minimum wage. The grass-roots and labour organizers called for an increase in the minimum wage, with strong support from De Blacio and signed into law by the Government. (Andrew Como) But a large part of the declining poverty rate is the strong economy, as she said. \"The city has done much in recent years to improve the economic prospects of the neediest New Yorkers,\" said Harold Stohlber, the leading economist of the New York Society of Community Services, a low-income research and advocacy organization, but it is difficult to isolate their effects from other factors. De Blasieu commends his administration &apos; s pressure to mainstream kindergartens to help families control the costs of childcare. Other policies - paid sick leave, housing programmes and improved access to social services benefits - assist low-income families, according to its administration. This year, the city has also implemented cuts in public transport, which help people get cheaper jobs. The measure of urban poverty is one way to assess how life has changed for low-income people, as stated by Robert Hawkins, Associate Professor of Poverty Studies at New York University. But he also referred to the homeless inhabitants of the city, who were on the rise, according to the Coalition for Displaced Persons. Hawkins said, \"Let's say we've reached this figure a good point in talking, but in order to affect people's lives, we have to eradicate poverty, it's more than a number.\" Our rule, De Blasio, said that his administration had brought hundreds of thousands of people out of poverty in the past five years. The Department &apos; s methodology for measuring poverty, which was recognized as effective, calculated that the number of people living in poverty or near poverty in 2017 was 236,500 fewer because the poverty rate was lower than in 2013. But his statement did not include the term \"neighbourhood of poverty.\" He said poverty. Even using the definition of a city as poor, there are about 140,000 poor people in New York City today below the declining poverty rate. This isn't hundreds of thousands. In addition, the federal poverty rate was declining at the national level, and the city enjoyed a strong economy during the State of De Placio. While the city has implemented and supported initiatives to help low-income people, experts doubt that its policies have lifted all these people out of poverty, as indicated by its use of the word \"we.\" We value his claim half right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00546"}
