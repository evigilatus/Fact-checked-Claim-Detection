The numbers can be a great gauge of a person\u2019s grassroots support, although the figures may not have much bearing on whether that candidate wins.\n\nState Rep. Mary Nolan, D-Portland, is no different in her campaign to unseat incumbent Amanda Fritz from the Portland City Council. On Nolan\u2019s campaign website, she lists heavy-hitting endorsements from former Gov. Barbara Roberts and former Portland Mayor Vera Katz.\n\nAnd this: \"Over 8,000 people have supported her campaign as volunteers, donors and advisors and endorsers.\"\n\nMore than 8,000 individuals support Nolan? The number seemed a bit suspect for a City Council race. It\u2019s a small matter, but if it\u2019s meant to reflect broad support, we figured it was ripe for a fact check.\n\nFirst, we checked with other Portland city candidates to get a ballpark feel. We started with the three main mayoral contenders.\n\nStacey Dycus, campaign director for candidate Jefferson Smith, said the campaign has 2,000 individual donors, 850 volunteers, and endorsements from 500 people. Of course, those numbers probably overlap.\n\nCampaign manager Jessica Moskovitz said Charlie Hales\u2019 campaign probably has about 4,000 people in the category of endorsers, volunteers, supporters and donors. We checked the list of supporters on his website and found at least 800 individual names.\n\nNeel Pender, a spokesman for Eileen Brady, said such numbers can be fuzzy -- it\u2019s all in how you count them after all -- but that \"8,000 seems high unless you count all the members of your endorsing organizations.\" Brady\u2019s website lists more than 700 individual names as supporters.\n\nAgain, we\u2019re looking at magnitude, not exactitude. But it appears that 8,000 individual supporters is a big number for a citywide race.\n\nKJ Lewis, Nolan\u2019s campaign manager, cleared up the mystery behind the numbers pretty quickly for us. She explained that the campaign included the individual members of unions that have endorsed Nolan -- even if the individual might not support Nolan.\n\nIs that fair?\n\n\"I think so, because they all contribute to their union so they have a collective voice; they have a process to decide who they are endorsing,\" Lewis said. \"I think a case could be made that the union members can be counted as supporters.\n\nLet\u2019s see which unions back Nolan, according to her website: International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW Local 48); American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME Local 189, AFSCME Local 328, AFSCME council 37); International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU Local 8 and state council); Service Employees International Union (SEIU Local 49).\n\nAlso, Portland firefighters and police. That\u2019s a hefty list. Did the unions care that she was counting some of their members as individual supporters to boost her number?\n\n\"My members know she\u2019s been a friend of the IBEW for many, many years,\" said Joe Esmonde, political director for electrical workers. \"I get elected and chosen to make these decisions and put it to the membership, and I\u2019m down in the Capitol a lot and she has a 97 percent rating from the AFL-CIO, and she\u2019s always been good to the building trades.\"\n\nSure, he acknowledges that all 1,600 active members in Portland may not vote for her -- or vote at all -- but he\u2019s OK with Nolan counting his people. So were other representatives we called. Of course, you\u2019re probably thinking, what else would they say?\n\nFritz makes the point, rightly, that not all members of a union will support the endorsement. Nolan\u2019s campaign website states that more than 8,000 people volunteer, donate, advise and endorse her. (By the way, the last time we checked Nolan had at least 280 individuals named as supporters on her website; Fritz had 480. We heart you Excel!)\n\nUnions are valuable when it comes to campaigning on behalf of a candidate -- making phone calls, knocking on doors -- and donating political action committee money. But a union endorsement is not the same thing as getting support or money from the individuals who make up that union.\n\nThe statement is partially accurate in that certain unions with their memberships have endorsed Nolan. But the statement takes things out of context, in that the members have not all individually cited support for Nolan. We find her statement Half True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDennis Richardson\n\n\nstated on June 30, 2011 in a press briefing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Oregon state employees received a \"catch-up\" pay raise in 1981 -- just two years after they agreed not to take a raise in exchange for a retirement benefit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Janie Har \u2022 September 2, 2011", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11220"}
