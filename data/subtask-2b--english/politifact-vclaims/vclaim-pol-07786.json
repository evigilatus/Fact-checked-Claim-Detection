And it\u2019s going to impact our economy, our future,\" Baldwin said May 8, 2014 on the Devil\u2019s Advocate show on Madison radio.\nA week later, Baldwin announced her support for a bill sponsored by U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) that would allow borrowers to refinance student loans at an interest rate of 3.86 percent, much lower than most federal loan options.\nWith graduation season in full swing, we thought we\u2019d take a look.\nStudies show seven out of every 10 college graduates has student loan debt, but is Baldwin right about the $30,000 figure and that it affects an entire generation?\nSpokesman John Kraus said Baldwin\u2019s source was a December 2013 report from the Institute for College Access & Success, an independent, nonprofit group that tracks student loan debt by state.\nThe California-based group advocates for more available and affordable higher education. Various funders support its efforts, including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Ford Foundation.\nTo complete its 2012 report, the institute relied on federal data and a survey sent to colleges through Peterson\u2019s, a college guide publishing company.\nThe report says the average debt nationally for those 2012 graduates who took out loans was $29,400. Among Wisconsin graduates, the average debt was $28,102, the nation\u2019s 14th highest.\nSo Baldwin\u2019s claim was pretty on target for both national and state levels.\nThe debt itself, however, varies widely by state, from $18,000 to $33,650, and even more so by college, from $4,450 to $49,450. The likelihood for graduating seniors to have debt after college also stretches from 41 percent to 78 percent depending on the state.\nBut the report itself notes its data offers an incomplete picture because only about half of all public and private nonprofit four-year colleges reported their student-loan debt figures 2012.\nThat can skew the results.\nAdditionally, the figures don\u2019t differentiate between federal or private loans. Private loans make up one fifth of overall student loan debt, which colleges cannot document as easily.\nAnd no for-profit colleges are included because none reported their debt figures, while the report shows they have the most borrowers at 88 percent. They also rack up the highest debt at an average of $39,950 per borrower.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Godlewski\n\n\nstated on January 9, 2021 in Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all women that lost jobs (in the December jobs report), it was mostly Black and Latina women.

This led them to conclude that \"the more-rapid expansion\" of student loan debt in early 2012 has not been as fast this past year.\nAll this research undermines Baldwin\u2019s point. The level of college debt is a moving target.\nWhile Baldwin painted the $30,000 figure as affecting a generation of students, the data she cited is limited to a specific graduating class. And studies show three of every 10 graduates finish without student loan debt.\nOur rating\nBaldwin claimed that \"this generation, on average, is starting their careers, if they\u2019ve been to a four-year college, with just under $30,000 in debt.\"\nWhile she cites a figure from a legitimate source, that data has limitations that are not acknowledged. Notably, about half of the colleges were not included in the data used to create the state-by-state breakdown. Additionally, the national figure is for 2012 and more recent studies show a more mixed picture and in some cases suggest the level may be lower.\nWe rate her statement Half True.\n(Note: This item was changed June 5, 2014 to clarify the source of data used to calculate the average student-loan debt and that additional, more recent studies show the debt level may be lower, not decreasing.)", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07786"}
