In fact, rumors are an attempt to disfigure Belusi by using an American college student only because she was an intern at Belusi University for a class of Ukrainian origin. The common picture appeared here in October 1 throughout the social media with a text on it: \"The legislative assistance of Nancy Belusi, Ivana Voronovich, from Ukraine, is linked to the Ukrainian Embassy, the Ukrainian Army, the Ukrainian Government and Ukrainian party life... how this Ukrainian was authorized to work in the third person's office in the United States. - The presidency? Another picture posted on the top corner of the left hand shows a man and a woman along with more of the text that says, \"Father's Head Villarit of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church\" and \"The Order of the Mother of Ukraine is worthy of military and political activity.\" These articles were referred to as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This allegation is inaccurate. Polyte Fact found that Ivana Voronovic was an intern at the Belusi District Office in Washington, D.C., in a university semester, but did not (and is not currently) work in Belusi as an assistant, nor did she hold any other position in the Belusi Office. (The Speaker of the House of Representatives is the second in the Presidency and not the third, as the post says.) It appears that the rumor arose with September 30, 2019, a story by a website on the right, the Bondet Gate. According to that story, Voronovich \"started her career working at the American Embassy in Ukraine in Kiev\" and \"worked with Roman Voronovich, head of Kiev's office, who is connected to Nancy Pelosi.\" In addition, \"the parents of Voronovic are closely linked. Her mother worked with the Ukrainian army, and she even received the Order of Ukrainian Merit for Military and Political Activity. The father of Euronovich was a member of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine and is also associated with the Ukrainian Government.\" It should be noted: Roman Voronovich is Wald Voronovich and is not on the list as head of the office of the United States Embassy in Ukraine, although he works for the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in Kiev, according to the Agency &apos; s spokesman. Bolivi Vakt contacted Voronovich about the rumors. She responded by e-mail, explaining that she was an American citizen and had lived in Ukraine as well as other countries because of her father &apos; s work with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). She was training in Belusi in the spring of 2018 while a second-year student at Northeastern University in Boston and when Belusi was the leader of the minority at home. Voronovich said that her father was a citizen of Michigan, not the head of Kiev's office at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, as was the case in office. Voronovic is now a senior student at the University of Michigan, where, as a transfer student, she studies political science and philosophy. On January 22, 2021, Jeremy \"Spike\" Cohen mentioned an article on Facebook in which the Paiden administration said that she was a liberal terrorist. By Madison Chubik \u2022 22 January 2021 \"since the completion of my training I have had no contact with the speaker, as I imagine she is busy with things more important than following her former trainees,\" said Voronovic. She had spent the last five years as a summer employee of the United States Embassy in Ukraine but had never worked with the Ukrainian Embassy in the United States or elsewhere. \"I have no relations with the Ukrainian Government or army outside the work I did during my career in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\" Ivana Voronovic &apos; s mother, Victoria Voronovic, is a Ukrainian citizen and co-founder of the International Alliance for Non-Profit Brotherly Assistance, which helped raise funds to deliver medical supplies, equipment, equipment and other materials to Ukrainian soldiers who were fighting against Russian-backed rebels, according to an interview in 2015 with the newspaper Makombo Dili, a newspaper in Detroit. The picture on the left upper corner of Facebook shows that Victoria Voronovich received a medal from the father of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church for her volunteer work in the conflict zone, according to Ivana Vornovich, who also sent a photograph of the PolitiFact medal, indicating that it was presented in 2015. Ivana Voronovic said that the organization, apparently based in Kiev, had raised funds from other Ukrainians now living in the United States, most notably Michigan, Illinois and North Carolina. In these days, Ivana Voronovic said that her mother &apos; s work involved supporting persons with disabilities both at birth and through participation in the conflict. \"This story is a trick and a strange set of twisted lies,\" said Voronovich. \"I've received disturbing messages from people who have chosen to believe this misinformation, which makes me feel insecure as a potential target. Comments under some Facebook articles alone are enough to make one worry. \"I am a private citizen, and I should not be subjected to such invasion of privacy, defamation and defamation of my personality.\" On October 3, Voronwitz also published a response to the rumors surrounding his daughter on his Facebook page, stating that she was an American citizen who was detained with Belusi while also working at the American Embassy in Ukraine during the summer. He wrote that rumors had led to death threats: \"My daughter, Ivana Voronovic, was hit hard two days ago by robots with stories containing open lies and twisted facts. She is an American citizen, a student of honour and a social activist, and was also detained with Speaker Belusi, while also working at the American Embassy in Ukraine during the summer. It has no links with the Ukrainian army or the Ukrainian Embassy. Dozens of pieces of flight sites at night share these terrible and dangerous lies. The results were death threats and misleading comments made by a clearly deranged, heartless, less soulless and morally empty ******. No one deserves this.\" Drew Hamel, Deputy Chief of Staff of Belusi, Poletti Vakt, confirmed that Voronovic was an intern at the Belusi Personal Office in Washington, which only works on representative issues for the Congressional Region in Belucci, California XII. \"This person was a trainee in our personal office (means CA-12, not the command office). She was an unpaid trainee in the spring of 2018, who answered the phone and performed other administrative duties, and he wrote Hamill in an e-mail. \"Speaker takes a picture with every trainee while in Washington.\" On May 31, 2018, at the same time, Voronovic posted a picture of her shaking hands with Belusi on her Facebook page. Our Facebook article presents a picture of a woman who shakes the hands of Nancy Belusi and claims that the woman, Ivana Voronovich, is the \"Lusi Legislative Assistant\" from Ukraine and is related to the Ukrainian Embassy, the Ukrainian Army, the Ukrainian Government and Ukrainian party life. Ivana Voronovich lived in Ukraine and worked once as an unpaid trainee for Belarus for a semester in 2018. But she's also an American citizen who doesn't work for Belose. Her mother, an American citizen, was also active in Ukraine and had previously assisted in delivering food and supplies to military personnel. These rumors wrongly suggest that Voronovich, an American, has a significant impact on Pelosi, based solely on the Ukrainian heritage of Voronovic and because she was once trained in the Belucci office. We assess it wrong. Update, October 10, 2019: This story was updated to reflect the fact that the spokesman for the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) confirmed that Roman Voronovich was working there. This addition does not affect the provision.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00078"}
