Well, here he is with both\u2026 Lying POS!!!!\"\nA photo included in the post shows Joe and Hunter Biden standing with two other men holding golf clubs on a green in the Hamptons in 2014.\u00a0\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) So we looked into it.\nFirst, during the \"60 Minutes\" interview, Joe Biden never mentioned Ukraine or Burisma, where Hunter Biden was a board director while Joe Biden was vice president.\u00a0\nSecond, the photo doesn\u2019t show Taras Burdeinyi, CEO of Burisma, or Mykola Zlochevsky, the company\u2019s founder and owner.\nThe man on the far left is Devon Archer, another American board member of Burisma who worked with Hunter Biden in a series of investment and consulting firms in 2008.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStanding next to him is Ralph Pasucci, founder of Netrex Capital Markets LLC, a New York investment banking firm.

Rather, Biden said he\u2019d never spoken to his son about his overseas business dealings.\u00a0\nIn either case, Biden didn\u2019t mention Burisma during the \"60 Minutes\" interview, and the photo doesn\u2019t show the Burisma CEO.\u00a0\nWe rate this Facebook post False.\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click here, for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18833"}
