That\u2019s a disgrace. Budgets are statements of values. And to look at our budget, you\u2019d think prisons were more important than education.\" \n\nEastin makes her claim at about the 46:00 minute mark in the town hall.\u00a0\nWas Eastin right about those rankings? We decided to fact check her per student vs. per prisoner spending comparison.\n41st in per student spending?\nTo support the first part of the statement, Eastin\u2019s campaign pointed to a January 2017 report by the California Budget and Policy Center. The nonprofit, which is described in some media reports as left-leaning, analyzes how budget and tax policies affect low- and middle-income Californians.\nIts report found \"California ranked 41st among all states in spending per K-12 student after adjusting for differences in the cost of living in each state.\" It used data from the 2015-16 fiscal year.\nCalifornia schools spent $10,291 per K-12 student that year, or about $1,900 less than the $12,252 per student spent by the nation as a whole, the report said. Notably, California\u2019s per student spending was up about $2,000 from the 2012-13 fiscal year, when the state ranked 50th in the nation.\nJonathan Kaplan, the report\u2019s author and a senior policy analyst at the center, told us the report applies a wage-based index to account for California\u2019s high teacher salaries. This adjustment, he said, allows for a valid spending comparison between states that pay employees much less.\nClarifications missing\nEastin\u2019s statement does not clarify that the 41st in the nation ranking includes an adjustment for cost-of-living. Nor does she mention that California\u2019s per pupil spending has moved up the rankings in recent years. \u00a0\nThe budget center is not the only group that ranks per pupil spending.\nEdWeek, a publication that covers K-12 education, ranked California 46th in per student spending, also using a cost of living adjustment. It\u2019s most recent ranking, however, uses older data, from 2013-14, that doesn\u2019t account for recent state spending increases.\nBy contrast, the National Education Association conducts a straight spending comparison. It placed California\u2019s per pupil spending at 22nd for 2015-16.\nIn February 2017, EdSource.org published an in-depth look at the ways California\u2019s per pupil spending has been ranked by different groups.\nIt summarized its findings this way:\n\"Since 2011-12, the low point in funding following the 2007-08 recession, California has increased K-12 funding by more than $20 billion. As a result, its average per-student spending has significantly increased, and its ranking among the states has improved in the three most frequently cited studies.\nBut there\u2019s a big variation in the state\u2019s ranking among the three because they use different methods and different data. California has moved up some but continues to be in the bottom fifth of states, according to Education Week and the California Budget and Policy Center, while the National Education Association places California near the middle.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin Nunes\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in an interview on Fox\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRepublicans have no way to communicate\u201d after tech companies cut off Parler.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Amy Sherman \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPer prisoner spending\nTo support Eastin\u2019s claim that California is \"No. 1 in per prisoner expenditure,\" her campaign directed us to a June 2017 Associated Press article that describes those costs as \"the nation\u2019s highest.\" It said California\u2019s per-inmate cost was expected to \u00a0climb to $75,560 in the next year.\n\"Since 2015, California\u2019s per-inmate costs have surged nearly $10,000, or about 13%. New York is a distant second in overall costs at about $69,000,\" the AP reported.\nIn August 2017, PolitiFact California rated Mostly True Sen. Kamala Harris\u2019 claim \"it costs $75,000 per year\" to lock up an inmate in the state, based in part on the AP article and state budget estimates.\nWe found several reasons for the dramatic cost increase. Most notable is California\u2019s sharp drop in inmates combined with higher corrections spending, resulting from greater state contributions to prison employee pensions.\nThe inmate drop is driven by a 2009 U.S. Supreme Court order for California to reduce prison overcrowding. California\u2019s prison population reached a peak of 163,000 inmates in 2006, according to the Public Policy Institute of California. The state estimates it will house an average of about 119,000 prisoners this year.\nMeanwhile, there\u2019s been no corresponding reduction in prison staff as inmate number have fallen, causing per capita costs to spike.\nJeffrey Callison, a state prisons spokesman, told us the conditions of the court order prevent California from closing prisons even as the inmate population is reduced.\n\"So long as the order is in effect we cannot close prisons because to do so would reduce our capacity, thereby pushing us back above 137.5 percent\" level of prison crowding, Callison\u00a0said in an email.\u00a0That\u00a0level is tied to prison capacity and defined by the court, he said.\nPrisoner cost to keep climbing\nLooking ahead, the per inmate cost is expected to go up again -- to $80,729 -- under Gov. Jerry Brown\u2019s proposed 2018-19 budget released this month.\nPolitiFact California could not immediately obtain current per prisoner cost estimates for the state of New York. Various rankings have listed New York as No. 1 for per prisoner costs, including a Vera Institute of Justice report using the earlier 2015 data.\nChristian Henrichson, research director at the Vera Institute, told us by email that California and New York \"are neck and neck on this measure, and the answer may depend on the year studied.\"\nCalifornia\u2019s continued per prisoner cost spike \"would place CA in the top spot,\" Jon Murchinson, Eastin\u2019s campaign spokesman, asserted in an email.\nWhile we don\u2019t have all the exact figures, that\u2019s a fairly safe bet.\nThough per capita inmate costs continue to climb, that doesn\u2019t mean California spends more on prisons than K-12 education, as some might take from Eastin\u2019s claim. The reverse is correct: Gov. Jerry Brown\u2019s current general fund budget projects spending 42 percent, or $55 billion, on the K-12 system. Meanwhile, it proposes spending 9 percent, or about $12 billion, on the prison system.\nOur ruling\nCandidate for governor Delaine Eastin recently claimed California ranks 41st in per pupil K-12 spending but is \"No. 1 in per prisoner\" spending.\nShe relied on a January 2017 policy center report that backs up the per pupil spending ranking, after adjusting for cost of living. Another ranking that makes a straight spending comparison puts California at 22nd for per pupil spending. Eastin did not make this clear in her statement nor did she note that California\u2019s per student spending has increased in recent years.\nEastin\u2019s claim that California is No. 1 for per prisoner costs is backed up by a 2017 Associated Press report, which listed New York a distant second. While we could not immediately find current figures for New York, we discovered that California\u2019s per prisoner costs are expected to again rise -- to more than $80,000 -- in the next fiscal year, several thousand dollars higher than in recent years.\nOverall, Eastin\u2019s comparison is supported by recent studies.
