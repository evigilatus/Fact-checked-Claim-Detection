Orrin Hatch and said it came from basketball star Shaquille O\u2019Neal.\nThe Dec. 10 headline includes an awkwardly worded alleged quote by the basketball star: \"Shaquille O\u2019Neal says: \u2018Trump is possibly the best president of the president of all times ever, he is not afraid to...\u2019\nFacebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network\u2019s efforts to combat fake news. We found no evidence that O\u2019Neal made that statement.\nThe story started with a quote by Hatch that Trump had \"been one of the best presidents\" he ever served under.\nThat was followed by a supposed quote by O\u2019Neal:\n\"I don\u2019t pay much attention to his tweets. I\u2019ll say this for you. He\u2019s been one of the best presidents I\u2019ve served under. And the reasoning is, he\u2019s not afraid to make decisions. He\u2019s not afraid to take on the -- the big mouths around here.\"\nIn reality, a video of Hatch showed that he was the one who made that statement after he was asked about Trump\u2019s tweets in November. (Hatch, a Utah Republican, announced Jan. 2 that he will not seek re-election.)\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe did find real examples of O\u2019Neal talking about Trump optimistically. Before the 2016 election, O\u2019Neal referred to Trump as his friend but suggested he tweak his language.\n\"I think if he could reword some of the things he says and put it in business form, it would really make sense,\" O\u2019Neal said, according to a video posted in 2015. \"Donald is like a straight-up guy.\"\nIn November 2016 after Trump won, O\u2019Neal said on TNT that \"everyone was in shock\" about the outcome but that he hoped Trump would bring people together.\n\"It\u2019s kind of hard to believe that a guy with no political experience is the president of the United States,\" O\u2019Neal said, calling for the public to give Trump a chance to do his job.\nWe sent a message to Pro Conservative News on Facebook and did not get a reply.\nThe headline stated that O\u2019Neal said Trump \"is possibly the best president.\" This fake news story appeared to take a quote from Hatch and attribute it to O\u2019Neal. It was Hatch who said of Trump \"he\u2019s been one of the best presidents I\u2019ve served under.\"\nWe rate this claim\u00a0Pants on Fire.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/721afede-61ae-484f-988e-533bd0c47d69", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02554"}
