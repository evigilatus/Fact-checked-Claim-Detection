As Halloween approaches, a viral Facebook bulletin claims that the famous \"Nithmar on Elm Street\" serial killer Freddy Krueger was based on a real killer. The post presents a picture of a tombstone who reads \"Fredrick Krueger 1838-1910\" with a long title that says: \"You know that the character of the horror film Freddy Krueger was based on a real serial killer who lived in Rockville, Wisconsin, in the 18th century. According to the district records of the court at the time, Mr. Krueger was known to have killed at least 20 children within a three-mile radius from where he lived. It is reported that most children were killed using only the garden claw.\" It is alleged that Krueger lived in an abandoned factory and was eventually arrested after the start of a fire at a facility where he \"burned more than 70% of his body.\" After he died in his sleep at the age of 72, the article says, there were unexpected deaths of adolescents and children in their sleep, and thus later a source of inspiration for Kruger's notorious terrifying personality. The article was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) I'm sorry, but we have to put this scary story to rest. Krueger wasn't built on a real person -- the story is completely made up. On January 10, 2021, in an article on Facebook, he said that Nancy Belusi sent a letter to the mayor of Portland after demonstrations there \"to demand that he stick to the proven democratic playbook.\" By Sierra Aurourke on January 11, 2021, copies of this claim were shared online for several years, with different details. Research into the opposite image shows that the image of the tombstone was uploaded in October 2017, at about the same time rumors were first posted on social media. But unlike most copies and posters that have been shared online since then, the original article finally contained a line that admitted that the story was made as a Halloween joke: \" (In fact, I just found this picture and made it all. Happy October for everyone!\" At the same time, the director of horror movies and the creative Krueger, the late Wes Craven, in an interview with the eagle in 2014, revealed that he had obtained the idea of the film from a scary news story he read in the Los Angeles Times: \"I had read an article in the Los Angeles Times about a family who escaped from Cambodia's killing fields and was able to reach the United States. It was okay, and suddenly the little boy had very disturbing nightmares. He told his parents he was afraid that if he slept, the thing chasing him would get him, so he tried to stay awake for days at a time. When he finally fell asleep, his parents thought this crisis was over. Then they heard screams in the middle of the night. By the time they got there, he was dead. He died in the middle of a nightmare. Here he was a young man with a vision of horror that everyone denied. This central line of nightmare became Elm Street.\" Our judgment is a scary tale that Freddie Krueger was based on a real serial killer recirculating social media. This story is fabricated. While the Creator of Krueger has already revealed that \"Nithmar on Elm Street\" is inspired by a legitimate news account, this account did not include a serial killer in real life. We value these rumors of pants on fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00093"}
