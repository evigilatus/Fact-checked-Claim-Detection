That means the business-backed lobbying group Associated Industries of Florida is also\u00a0announcing a new group to help the state make decisions about water quality and quantity.\nIn a Feb. 6 press release, AIF announced the H20 Coalition, a group described only as \"stakeholders\" who plan to help mold legislation for water laws. The group points out some reasons for this marked interest.\n\"Years of below average rainfall in large parts of Florida combined with reduced infrastructure spending during the recession, have exacerbated a growing shortfall in water supply across the state, drawing the attention of Florida's businesses, environmental groups, utilities and government,\" the release said.\nIt seems like there\u2019s been a lot of rain across the state lately. Is it true swaths of Florida have been experiencing a persistent lack of rain over the years? We decided to examine the rain gauges and find out.\nRain check\nThe state\u2019s main groundwater supply is the Floridan Aquifer, which also supplies parts of Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina. The aquifer\u2019s network loses water as it is pumped out of the ground through wells or city water systems, and relies on rainfall to recharge water levels.\nAndy O\u2019Reilly, a hydrologist with the U.S. Geologic Survey\u2019s Florida Water Science Center in Orlando, says that across the state, anywhere from less than one to 25 or more inches of annual rainfall has the potential to soak into the aquifer, depending on the local geology. Even much of that ends up as runoff in rivers and streams. The rest of the precipitation either evaporates or is used by plants for transpiration.\n\"Rainfall is the biggest component in maintaining the aquifer on a regional level,\" he said, noting that the Floridan Aquifer is particularly sensitive to precipitation levels -- and from overpumping by homes and industries during dry spells.\u00a0\nSo the first thing we did was look into statewide rainfall totals. Checking in with the Florida Climate Center provided a quick look at statewide totals over the years.\nOver the last 30 years, Florida has averaged a little more than 54 inches of rain per year, among the highest in the country. Going back to 2000, an extremely dry year, there have been five years of below-average rainfall statewide (2012 was the most recent complete year available):\n\n\n\n\nYr\n\n\n\u201800\n\n\n\u201801\n\n\n\u201802\n\n\n\u201803\n\n\n\u201804\n\n\n\u201805\n\n\n\u201806\n\n\n\u201807\n\n\n\u201808\n\n\n\u201809\n\n\n\u201810\n\n\n\u201811\n\n\n\u201812\n\n\n\n\nAvg\n\n\n43.2\n\n\n54.5\n\n\n59.4\n\n\n61.1\n\n\n59.2\n\n\n62.7\n\n\n42.6\n\n\n45.2\n\n\n55.1\n\n\n56.0\n\n\n49.1\n\n\n48.9\n\n\n55.5\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nSo, five out of 13 years were below average, which is about 40 percent.\nWe checked the state\u2019s five water management districts, designed to tend to water resources across\u00a0Florida.\u00a0AIF\u00a0said that \"large parts\" of Florida had below average rainfail, so numbers by district give us a sense of how rainfall measures up on a regional basis.\nFor instance, the Southwest Florida Water Management District, which extends from parts of Marion County down to Sarasota County, has a 30-year rainfall average of 51.2 inches.

In the Northwest Florida Water Management District, covering the Panhandle from Escambia County to the western half of Jefferson County, district-wide data isn\u2019t kept, but rather organized by cities where rainfall totals are measured.\nIn Panama City, for example, the 30-year rainfall average is 61 inches. They\u2019re an example of a location being hit by some below average years lately:\n\n\n\n\nYr\n\n\n\u201800\n\n\n\u201801\n\n\n\u201802\n\n\n\u201803\n\n\n\u201804\n\n\n\u201805\n\n\n\u201806\n\n\n\u201807\n\n\n\u201808\n\n\n\u201809\n\n\n\u201810\n\n\n\u201811\n\n\n\u201812\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvg\n\n\n41.2\n\n\n50.4\n\n\n49.0\n\n\n64.7\n\n\n46.3\n\n\n52.6\n\n\n42.5\n\n\n35.8\n\n\n57.8\n\n\n53.6\n\n\n48.7\n\n\n38.7\n\n\n65.8\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nThat means 11 years between 2000-12 had below average rainfall, or 85 percent.\nWhat the climatologists say\nBut do these numbers mean there\u2019s a shortage of rainfall in the state? Climatologist David Zierden with the Florida Climate Center says no. While it\u2019s true there have been some drier years than normal in the past decade or so, there have been plenty of wetter than average years, too. He said 2013 was the 14th or 15th rainiest year on record since 1895.\nTracking average rainfall means \"there will be some winners and some losers,\" Zierden said. Sometimes the totals are above the average, and sometimes they\u2019re below, which is the nature of Florida\u2019s rainfall. This is a pattern that repeats across the state\u2019s climate zones.\nHe added the state has been in and out of drought over the last decade, but recent years are no worse than 2000 and 2001, which coincided with three dry years of La Nina conditions.\n\"Here in Florida we\u2019re really dominated by year-to-year totals,\" he said. \"There\u2019s no statistically significant trend at work here.\"\nThose rainfall variances, as inconsistent as they may be, still mean parts of the state have had dry years, and hydrologist O\u2019Reilly said they still could affect the aquifer. That\u2019s because the recharge rate is not a direct ratio to the rainfall total; for example, a 20 percent decrease in rainfall could mean quite a bit more than a 20 percent decrease in the recharge rate.\nOverall, the accumulated effects of rainfall deficits and surpluses combine with the rate at which people pump water out of the aquifer to affect the water supply\u2019s long-term balance, he said.\nThe AIF press release doesn\u2019t mention overpumping from the aquifer as part of the problem maintaining the water supply, but some experts say that would be the real driver of any shortfalls. And commercial interests, especially agriculture, are responsible for most of that overpumping during dry periods.\nTom Swihart, the former head of the Office of Water Policy in the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, says not only are estimates of future water supply shortfalls historically too high, but currently funded water projects all but meet those goals. Water usage by residents is on a downward trend as well, not just in Florida, but nationwide. But even keeping that in mind, ensuring quality should take precedent over quantity, Swihart said.\n\"All of this concern about water supply deflects attention from the much more serious problem of excessive nutrients in Florida waters,\" he said, referring to the proliferation of fertilizers, pesticides and dangerous chemicals in the water supply from the industries for which AIF lobbies. \"That truly is a statewide issue and needs urgent attention.\"\nOur ruling\nThe Associated Industries of Florida said in its press release that \"large parts of Florida\" have experienced \"years of below average rainfall.\" While parts of Florida have had below-average rainfall, we also saw years of above-average rainfall. Climatologists told us the state overall is doing fine, thanks to the years when it was above average. Most recently, 2013 was the 14th or 15th rainiest year on record since 1895.\nWhile the record on rainfall is mixed, there are other issues that affect water levels in the aquifer. Overpumping for residential and commercial uses, especially during dry spells, has a lot to do with the dwindling water supply as well, but AIF, which lobbies for business interests that pump from the aquifer, makes no mention of that.\nThe claim is partially accurate, but leaves out important details.
