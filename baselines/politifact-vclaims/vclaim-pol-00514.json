Seth Moulton, D-Mass., took Biden to task again \u2014 this time after Biden flipped his position on the Hyde Amendment, a provision that bars Washington from spending federal money to pay for abortions.\n\"Bravo to @JoeBiden for doing the right thing and reversing his longstanding support for the Hyde Amendment,\" Moulton, a former U.S. Marine who served in Iraq, wrote in a June 7 tweet. \"It takes courage to admit when you're wrong, especially when those decisions affect millions of people. Now do the Iraq War.\"\nMoulton\u2019s tweet is based on a faulty premise. Moulton says that Biden admitted he was wrong about the Hyde Amendment. He didn\u2019t. He said he changed his stance due to a change in circumstances.\nAs for Biden\u2019s vote for a resolution that cleared the way for the Iraq War, he called it a mistake, but without admitting he was wrong.\nWe took a close look at his words on both topics. The ways Biden approached his shift on these two issues have more in common with one another than Moulton's tweet suggests.\nThe 2002 march to war\nBy the fall of 2002, the drum beat from President George W. Bush\u2019s administration on Iraq President Saddam Hussein and his nation\u2019s purported weapons programs left little doubt that military action was imminent. Senate Democrats split \u2014 29 in favor and 21 against \u2014 over whether to approve a resolution that would give Bush a free hand to launch an attack.\nPolitical scientist John Pitney at Claremont McKenna College said that Biden saw his vote for the resolution as making war less likely.\n\"Biden explained the authorization to use military force as a way to compel Iraq to abandon WMDs,\" Pitney said. \"He even said, \u2018I believe that failure to overwhelmingly support this resolution is likely to enhance the prospects that war will occur.\u2019\"\nIn the late hours of Oct. 11, 2002, Biden justified his vote by amplifying Bush\u2019s own words about avoiding war.\n\"He said that quote, \u2018war is neither imminent nor inevitable\u2019,\" Biden said. \"And that he desired to lead the world and, if war was necessary, it would be with allies at our side.\"\nBiden said the resolution wasn\u2019t perfect, but it leaned toward working with the international community to get Iraq to comply with U.N. resolutions.\nThe war started in March 2003. In 2004, Biden reflected on the vote he had cast.\n\"A year and a half ago, I voted to give President Bush the authority to use force in Iraq, Biden wrote in an op-ed. \"I still believe my vote was just \u2014 but the president's use of that authority was unwise in ways I never imagined.\"\nBy late 2005, the Iraq operation had unravelled. The weapons of mass destruction were nowhere to be found. Biden was asked on NBC\u2019s \"Meet the Press\" in November of that year if he thought his vote was a mistake.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was a mistake,\" Biden said on the show. \"It was a mistake to assume the president would use the authority we gave him properly.\"\nBiden continued: \"We gave the president the authority to unite the world to isolate Saddam. And the fact of the matter is we went too soon. We went without sufficient force. And we went without a plan.\"\nBiden\u2019s Iraq War vote dogged him when he ran for the nomination in 2008, and he stuck to the same message.\nInterviewed again on \"Meet the Press\" in 2007, Biden characterized his \"mistake\" less as a failure of his own judgment than as a failure of the Bush administration.\n\"I regret having believed that this administration had any competence,\" Biden said. \"It is the most incompetent administration I\u2019ve ever \u2014 if I\u2019d known they were going to misuse the authority we gave them the way they did, if I\u2019d known that they were going to, once they used it, be so incompetent in the using of it, I would have never ever, ever given them the authority.\"\nHyde Amendment reversal\nMoulton spokesman Matt Corridoni told us that while Biden might have expressed regret, his words were \"not very comprehensive.\" And Corridoni said there\u2019s the issue of timing.\n\"He hasn't addressed it yet as a 2020 candidate like he has Hyde,\" Corridoni said.\nWith the Hyde Amendment, Biden justified his shift on the grounds that access to abortion is under threat. He pointed to efforts to shutter Planned Parenthood clinics and limits tied to the Affordable Care Act.\n\"We now see so many Republican governors denying health care to millions of the poorest and most vulnerable Americans by refusing even Medicaid expansion,\" Biden said. \"I can't justify leaving millions of women without access to the care they need and the ability to exercise their constitutionally protected right.\"\nBiden painted his shift as the product of compassion and pragmatism, not contrition. It was about the states\u2019 moves to restrict access.\n\"I make no apologies in my last position,\" he said. \"I don't want to mislead you. If in fact, it (abortion service) was still available, I think, just as I've never attempted to impose my views on anyone else as to when life begins, I have never attempted to impose my view on who should pay for it.\"\n\"But folks, times have changed,\" Biden added.\nOur ruling\nMoulton said Biden hasn\u2019t admitted he was wrong on the Iraq War. And for Moulton, that was in stark contrast to Biden\u2019s headline-making reversal on the Hyde Amendment.\nIt is fair to say that Biden never said that it was wrong to go into Iraq under any circumstances. Rather, he expressed regret for having thought that Bush would wisely use the authority he had been given.\nWe leave it to others to decide if that is sufficient regret. But if Moulton saw that as different from how Biden talked about the Hyde Amendment, we find those differences slight.\nIn both cases, Biden cast his past actions as based on certain expectations or conditions that weren\u2019t met. He had just as many caveats when talking about his shift on the Hyde Amendment as he did about his Iraq War vote. And Biden pointedly never apologized for his past stance on Hyde.\nBiden never voiced contrition about the vote that cleared the way to war. But overall, we find that while Moulton\u2019s statement is partially accurate, it leaves out important details.\nThat\u2019s our definition of Half True.\nEditor's Note, June 20, 2019, 1:13 p.m.: This story\u00a0replaces an earlier version that was initally published at 12:06 p.m. in error.
