Where did the money go? For Scott Walker's friends. Walker gave his corporate friends half a billion dollars in tax exemptions and gifts.\" We've already assessed a false claim by the Wisconsin Grand Commission, that Walker gave $570 million in career development incentives to have \"chronicities\" or \"firm friends.\" Many of these funds went to companies whose employees had provided Democrats in the past, and many donations were small, and the role of Walker Employment Agency was limited in dealing with companies associated with a large portion of $570 million. But what about the claim that Walker will cut school funding, on the basis of every student, more than any other governor? What we know is that there is no dispute that shortly after taking office in January 2011, Walker significantly reduced school funding. In fact, in February 2012, we assessed the health of the broader claim -- that Walker has enacted \"the largest cuts in education in our state history.\" Reductions of $1.2 billion included $792 million in direct government aid to kindergarten schools up to grade 12, the focus of the New Wisconsin Grand Commission Declaration. However, verification of the facts did not calculate K-12 school discounts on a student basis compared to other states. Walker later returned some government aid to the schools. Before we go further, the Commission &apos; s Guide has a few words about the wording. The application of the Wisconsin Grand Commission refers to the financing of public schools. But, as we will see, the evidence that the Committee remembers is public expenditure by schools -- in other words, total spending of state funds, federal funds and local funds. Therefore, in addition to verifying the total expenditure figures that the Commission has mentioned to us in support of its claim, we will examine the State revenue figures -- the amount of money that has been given to public schools only by the State. According to the Wisconsin Grand Commission, the latest annual report from the United States Census Bureau compares all 50 states (and District of Columbia) on public school funding. The report issued in May 2014 covers the State of Wisconsin fiscal year 2011-2012, the first full financial year during the Walker term. (The state fiscal year runs from 1 July to 30 June; in other words, almost the same traditional school year. On a percentage basis, the Wisconsin reduction in gross expenditure per pupil - state funds, federal funds and local funds - was at the top of the scheme compared to the previous year. In terms of reductions, this is the best of five: state/provincial change per pupil in 2011-2012 from all sources from 2010-11 and Wisconsin 11,042-6.2% Florida 8,372-5.8% in Colombia 17,468.5.4% in Texas 8,261-4.7% in South Dakota 8,446 from the verification of specific facts mentioned on January 12, 2021 in the speech \"We have put $330 million in public school assistance - the largest in more than a decade.\" \u2022 26 January 2021 - 4.1 per cent, by contrast, the census report shows that in the four years prior to Walker's assumption of office, spending on each student in Wisconsin increased by 3.6 per cent in 2010-11, 2.6 per cent in 2009-10, 3.7 per cent in 2008-2009 and 4 per cent in 2007-2008. With regard to Bloom Walker's cuts, the Governor, along with the Republican-controlled legislature, was directly in control of State funds, which accounted for 48 per cent of expenditure by Wisconsin schools in 2011-2012. Through Collective Bargain Reform Act No. 10, Walker and the legislature have asked employees to pay more for their pensions and have enabled school areas to impose more costs on employees for health insurance as a means of compensating for some cuts in State aid. However, as noted in the assessment of the largest reductions in the mandate history claim, the statement by the Wisconsin Grand Commission on the net effect was not only the aspect of State financing of the equation. Loker and the legislature also had a significant impact on local finance, which accounted for 44 per cent of school spending, mainly because they frozen the amount of real estate tax revenues that local school areas could raise. Walker didn't have real control over federal funding, which was 8% of all Wisconsin school spending. Other measures now, using the same census report, let's look at revenue figures, focusing on the amount of State funds that have been disbursed to Wisconsin schools. Once again, Wisconsin was at the highest level in terms of reductions. REVENUE State per pupil in 2011-12 of the State Change Government from 2010-11 Wisconsin 5,544-8.33 percent Idaho 4,630-6.79 percent Arizona 018 0-0-6.46 percent Wyoming 9,466-5.05 percent Florida 2,373-4.84 percent. However, there are some new figures available. A May 2014 report on the Centre for Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank in Washington, D.C., examined State funding for schools in 2013-2014. These figures show that Wisconsin was among the 15 states that reduced State spending per student from the previous year. The reduction in Wisconsin by 0.6 per cent (at inflation rate) was not the largest, but the third. (Alaska's 3.2 percent reduction is the largest.) The funding for Wisconsin was $5.74 per student in 2013-2014, compared with $5.783 in the previous year. With regard to the comparison of states with regard to school funding for the entire term of Walker, these figures are not yet available. Our assessment is that the Wisconsin Grand Commission said: \"Scott Walker reduced school funding to every student more than any governor in America.\" Based on the latest census figures, the reductions in Wisconsin for 2011-2012 were the largest on two scales: State revenues for local schools and total expenditure from state schools, and federal and local funds. However, the most recent figures indicate that reductions in school spending in Wisconsin are no longer the largest, at least for a more recent period. For a precise statement, but it requires additional information, our classification is often correct.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07345"}
