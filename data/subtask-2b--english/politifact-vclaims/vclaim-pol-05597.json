Democrats said the focus, given the bad news from Oscar Mayer and several other major employers, should be on the economy and jobs.\n\"We are on pace to double layoffs since 2014,\" declared Assistant Minority Leader Katrina Shankland (D-Stevens Point.)\n\"This is the governor's worst year of his administration in terms of layoffs,\" she continued. \"We're well over 10,000 layoffs and the people of Wisconsin are crying out for action.\"\nWhen we asked Shankland\u2019s office for backup, an aide said Shankland was using state Department of Workforce Development data on notices of plant closings and mass layoffs.\nShankland aide Annika Petty noted the \"list does not yet include the layoffs announced in early November by Oscar Mayer.\"\nUnpacking the numbers\nFor 2014, the state received layoff warning notices that covered 7,239 jobs. As of Nov. 2, 2015, the tally for this year was 11,057.\nSo if you add in the Oscar Mayer layoff,that would bring it to about 12,050.\nThat\u2019s not quite double, but two months of data remained at the time Shankland made her claim and the numbers from earlier months suggest her claim is generally on target.\nBut the layoff number are nowhere near as solid as Shankland suggests.\nHere is how the system works:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin LeMahieu\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a TV interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It takes quite a while on Election Day to load those ballots, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Wisconsin, businesses are required to file warning notices with the state when they anticipate ending employment for more than 50 workers. Wisconsin\u2019s law is more strict than federal law, which sets the threshold at more than 100 workers.\nBut some layoffs never trigger a notice, because they don\u2019t reach the 50 person threshold. And the notices don\u2019t always mean lost jobs. When a company changes hands, the old firm is required to file a notice, even if all the workers will retain their jobs with the new firm.\nIn some cases, layoffs take place immediately. In other cases -- such as with Oscar Mayer -- the plant closing is expected months later. In still others, they never take place.\nSo the numbers don\u2019t represent actual layoffs. As such, experts say they are a lousy tool for assessing the state\u2019s economy.\nThat\u2019s what we found when we rated a July 2015 claim from the liberal group American Bridge 21st Century, which said Wisconsin\u2019s economy had \"tanked\" under Walker and \"so far in 2015 over 6,685 people have been laid off, already more than in all of 2014.\"\nWe rated the claim False.\nShankland\u2019s claim is somewhat different, in that she does not directly cite the number as evidence of the state\u2019s economy tanking. But she did make it at a news conference that asserted more action is needed on jobs due to poor economic performance.\nExperts such as Brian Jacobsen, an economist at Wells Fargo and a professor at Wisconsin Lutheran College, say a far better indicator of the employment picture -- but one that\u2019s not without it\u2019s own flaws -- is the monthly jobs report.\nThose numbers show that as of October 2015, the state added an estimated 30,300 jobs in 2015. That includes a preliminary estimate of 15,100 private sector jobs added in October alone. The number is preliminary and subject to change.\nBut the important point is this: Those figures are the net result of all changes, including layoffs and jobs added, not just one side of the coin.\nOur rating\nShankland said Wisconsin \"is on pace to double the number of layoffs this year.\"\nShe cited layoff notices received by the state. But those aren\u2019t actual layoffs. And while she\u2019s about right on the number of notices received, she\u2019s wrong to suggest that the employment numbers are headed downward this year.\nIn the time frame she cited the state\u2019s added about 30,300 jobs. We rate the claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05597"}
