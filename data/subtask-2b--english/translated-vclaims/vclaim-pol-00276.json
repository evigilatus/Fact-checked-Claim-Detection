Not exactly.", "text": "Many people on the Internet are convinced that part of every sale of energy drinks in Bang goes directly to the campaign to re-elect President Donald Trump or other efforts in Tramp 2020. The relationship between the energy drinks company and President Trump isn't as direct as these rumors say. On 5 August, a joint Facebook publication brought together more than 500 comments and 3,600 shares. He's showing a picture of Bang's energy drink with someone with his middle finger in front of him. The body of the article says, \"I didn't know, but I just found out that every time you buy Bang part of your money, it helps re-election Donald Trump goes to the MAGA funding campaign! This is a breakup. I can't support a company that helps support a man who puts children in cages, promotes racism, is a white fanatic, etc.\" The article was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) No, part of every Bang purchase of energy drinks does not directly finance Tramp's re-election efforts, but the parent company of Bang - Biopharmacists - has donated a large amount of money to the pro-tramp unitary party. The rumors began after Axis published a story on July 31, 2019, which cited supporters and associates of TROMP PAC America First Action, America First Policies, which raised approximately $18 million in the first half of 2019. The story identified some of the Commission &apos; s top donors: the real estate developer gave Jeffrey Palmer $2 million, the former Director of Small Business and the Executive Director of Wrestling Linda McMahon $1 million, and Vitals donated $250,000. According to the data of the Federal Election Commission, this contribution is the only one made by the company. On January 12, 2021, he wrote in an Instagram article saying that Joe Biden remained silent about the violence in Black Lives-Mite protests. By Tom Kircher: January 16, 2021, the People's Information website was picked up in connection with Pang-Vitale Pharmaceuticals from the report and published a subsequent story on August 1, with the headline, \"Every box of this energy drink helps re-elect Trump.\" It didn't take long for the prosecution to leak to the social media sites of the former Bang Christians who say they're giving up their energy drinks because of their political affiliation. However, the stories and social media overstate the connection of the energy drink to the Trump re-election campaign or related policy assessment centres. Yeah, her parent company donated $250,000 to the superhero Trump, but there's no direct distribution of a portion of every energy drink that's been bought. Neither Bang's website nor social media accounts advertise any kind of political fund-raising campaign. Polyte Fact also contacted the company, but did not respond immediately. In any case, the CEO of Biopharmaceuticals and the founder of Bang Energy, Jack Oak, and his wife, Meg Liz Oak, have expressed their support for Trump in the past. @realDonaldTromp your genius has ignited the greatest epic transformation of events in the history of politics. The inevitable God blesses Tramp.
