Kamala Harris asks, \"How can you dream when you're drowned in student loans?\" In a section on the high cost of living in America. Following the campaign, democratic presidential hope called the student loan debt \"one of the greatest challenges facing our country and our students.\" In the Senate, it helped to reactivate the Free College Act, a bill that says it will help reverse the increasing student debt crisis. Specifically, this programme will provide incentives to States by harmonizing grants to increase investments in public higher education. The Senator then made this vague allegation about the rapid growth of student loan debt in a news release on March 6, in which she announced her support for the bill: \"The total debt has increased by 170 per cent since 2006 and now exceeds $1.5 trillion, the second mortgage debt only and even exceeds credit card debt.\" Similar allegations were made a few days later. But is student loan debt growing so fast? And is it really just the second mortgage debt? We decided to check Harris' numbers in this fact. In support of this statement, a Harris spokesman cited a federal reserve table showing the cumulative debt of the student loan for each year from 2006 to 2018. He also cited articles from The Washington Post and Market Watch. The federal reserve schedule shows that student loan debts at the end of 2006 amounted to $521 billion. By the end of 2018, the last available period, it had grown to $1.57 trillion - a match to Harris' claim that it \"now exceeds $1.5 trillion.\" However, after calculating the figures, we found an increase of 201 per cent, faster than the 170 per cent that Harris referred to. Mark Cantruitz, a national financial aid expert, said, \"I say that her statement is mostly true.\" \"The only slight error is actually underestimating the growth of outstanding student loan debts.\" Kantrowitz is the publisher and vice president of research for FailforCollege.com, a guide to college savings plans. \"The only way to get 170 percent\" added, \"if you compare the current debt due to 2007 instead of 2006. This works to be 170 percent.\" On January 16, 2021, Jordan Rachel stated in Tweedda that the minimum wage of $15 per hour would raise the price of taco bill burrito to $38. On January 20, 2012, Hans Johnson, Director of the Institute of Public Policy at the Centre for Higher Education in California, also reviewed these data and found an increase of 200 percent based on the latest Fed figures. Source: Student loan data from the Federal Reserve. Why is college debt growing so fast? More students who go to college explain some growth in student loan debt, but only a small part, Cantruitz said. In 2006, there were 15.2 million university students. A decade later, this number rose to 16.9 million, citing figures from the National Centre for Education Statistics. Cantruitz added that another factor was that federal grants had slowed down as the level of education had risen. States often reduce study assistance when the first signs of a financial crisis emerge. The average student loan debt was about $30,000 for graduate students with bachelor &apos; s degree in 2018, as Cantruitz said. This number rises from approximately $21,000 in 2006. We found this part of Harris' statement to be accurate. In 2014, Polyte Fact Virginia stated that \"student debt began to exceed credit card debt in the second quarter of 2010,\" citing data from the Federal Reserve in New York. At the end of 2018, the country &apos; s total credit card debt was $870 billion and, according to data, mortgage balances amounted to $9.1 trillion. Our classification is X. Kamala Harris said, \"The total debt has increased by 170 percent since 2006 and now exceeds $1.5 trillion, which is only the second mortgage debt and even exceeds the credit card debt.\" I underestimated the speed with which student loans grew. The most recent Federal Reserve figures show that they have increased by 201 per cent since 2006. Harris was right about the college debt of $1.5 trillion, and it's just the second mortgage debt. We're mostly assessing her general statement right. In fact, this statement is accurate but requires further clarification or information.
