Economic growth has surged to 2.6% nationwide. You have to understand what that means. Nobody thought that number was going to happen. And at 3% growth in West Virginia. I wonder how that happened. 3% growth. West Virginia, you are leading the average. When was the last time you heard that, West Virginia? You are leading the country's average. Remember I told you don't sell your homes. Don't sell your homes. You are doing great. I'm so proud of you. You know, we won the state by 42 points. Can you believe that? 42 points. I asked your Republican party leader how would we be doing today versus November 8th and Election Day. He said honestly, President Trump, you are doing better. I said better? 42 points since our election, not mine, since our election we've added more than one million new jobs. And the good news keeping on pouring in. In fact, we have a very important announcement to make tonight. Does anybody know what that announcement is? Does anybody know what that announcement is? We have a very, very large announcement. Do you understand? Large. So I would like to invite my good friend and your Governor, Jim Justice, up to the stage to share this news with all of you. Jim, come on up. Come on up, Jim. Look at this guy. Jim is going to say a few words. These words have not been spoken by a major political figure, meaning Governor or Senator in our country for a long time. Thank you. First of all, it is a real honor. Thank you for coming. Thank our great President for being here. I've got to tell you a couple of stories real quick. I've been to the Oval Office twice in the last few weeks. I've been to present an idea on coal and manufacturing. I've had the great opportunity to be with our President. Let me tell you just this. I have to be serious with you just a moment. I have to tell you at the last session of our legislature I tried with all of my soul. Now I can tell you if you'll just give me just a moment. This man and myself are are not politicians. We ran to get something done. We ran and gave up part of our lives. We ran, because we want nothing. We ran as our founding fathers did years and years ago to serve now I will promise you until my soul that no one loves West Virginia more than I. In the last session, I would tell you that there was something greatness to passed with our rows and so on. But there was way too much pain. Now listen to me and listen really good. We hurt a lot of people. We hurt our vets and our teachers and our disabled and our weak and we walked away from at the old. Now I can promise you just this, I came  I came to only get something done. Let me just say this to you as bluntly as I can say it. West Virginia, at the altar when we had it done, like it or not like it, but the Democrats walked away from me. Now today I would tell you with los of prayers and lots of thinking, today I'll tell you as West Virginians, I can't help you being a Democrat Governor. So tomorrow I will be changing my registration to Republican. Applause, Cheers]
0074	Jim Justice	As a coach, I would tell you it is time to run another play.
0075	Jim Justice	I would also tell you this, please pay close attention to this.
0076	Jim Justice	My mom and dad were staunch lovers of Ronald Reagan.
0077	Jim Justice	Staunch Republicans.
0078	Jim Justice	My mom and dad are no question in my mind in heaven right now and their both saying the same thing.
0079	Jim Justice	But my mom is saying it more profoundly.
0080	Jim Justice	That is she's saying, Jimmy, it's about damn time you came to your senses.
0081	Jim Justice	Now let let me go one step further and say just this.
0082	Jim Justice	What in the world is wrong us as people?
0083	Jim Justice	Have we not heard enough about the Russians?
0084	Jim Justice	I mean to our God in heaven above.
0085	Jim Justice	The stock market is in 22,000.
0086	Jim Justice	And this country has hope.
0087	Jim Justice	We're on our way.
0088	Jim Justice	This man is the really dear friend of mine.
0089	Jim Justice	But you know what else is unbelievable?
0090	Jim Justice	This man now has a Chief of Staff that all of us can pronounce his first name.
0091	Jim Justice	And you know what that name is today?
0092	Jim Justice	It is "Sir".
0093	Jim Justice	Think about that.
0094	Jim Justice	Now I'll end by saying we're a long ways from being perfect.
0095	Jim Justice	There's mistakes made and change is tough.
0096	Jim Justice	I can tell you this tough.
0097	Jim Justice	I can tell you this This man is a reflection of his kids.
0098	Jim Justice	Eric Trump has been in the back of the woods changing a tire, I've talked with Donald Junior, and Ivanka and Jared,  even though Jared is our great soninlaw, are so good at being in charge.
0099	Jim Justice	Now I'll end by saying very quickly this man is a good man.
0100	Jim Justice	He's got  he's got a backbone, he's got real ideas.
0101	Jim Justice	We cares about America, he cares about us in West Virginia.
0102	Jim Justice	And most importantly of all, you know what?
0103	Jim Justice	He has made us as common, every everyday Americans, feel good and be proud of who we are.
0104	Jim Justice	My friend, our great President, Donald J. Trump.
0105	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0106	Donald Trump	I want to thank your great Governor.
0107	Donald Trump	Having big Jim as a Republican is such an honor.
0108	Donald Trump	I will tell you.
0109	Donald Trump	Such an honor.
0110	Donald Trump	It is a fantastic man.
0111	Donald Trump	A fantastic guy.
0112	Donald Trump	And thank you, Jim, very much all over the nation.
0113	Donald Trump	They are watching.
0114	Donald Trump	They really appreciate that.
0115	Donald Trump	And we have another friend with us tonight who voted for us on health care and honestly, how the Republicans and the Democrats let us down on that is hard to believe.
0116	Donald Trump	Repeal and replace.
0117	Donald Trump	Hard to believe.
0118	Donald Trump	Hard to believe.
0119	Donald Trump	Senators.
0120	Donald Trump	A Senator who voted for us, Shelley Moore, who is here with us tonight.
0121	Donald Trump	Thank you, Shelley.
0122	Donald Trump	Jim came to the Oval Office a couple of weeks ago.
0123	Donald Trump	We talked about how we are working together to open up the coal mines in this state and also very importantly to create jobs in furniture manufacturing, and other forms of manufacturing very important to Jim.
0124	Donald Trump	But Governor Justice did something else very important tonight.
0125	Donald Trump	He showed the country that our agenda rises above left or right it is an agenda for all of the people, especially for the tens of millions of forgotten Americans.
0126	Donald Trump	They are not so forgotten anymore.
0127	Donald Trump	I will tell you.
0128	Donald Trump	He approved that.
0129	Donald Trump	You proved it.
0130	Donald Trump	They are not forgotten anymore.
0131	Donald Trump	Countless citizens, Democrats, and Republicans, independents, have been neglected and ignored by Washington.
0132	Donald Trump	But we will make sure they are never ignored again.
0133	Donald Trump	We know there are powerful forces in Washington who want to stomp us.
0134	Donald Trump	But we won't let them.
0135	Donald Trump	We are fighting for every American who has been overlooked, pushed aside, or told to put their dreams on hold but we will win and we're winning though.
0136	Donald Trump	The failed voices in Washington who oppose our movement are the exact same people who gave us one terrible trade deal after another.
0137	Donald Trump	Who gave us one foreign policy disaster after another, and who sacrificed our sovereignty, our wealth, and our jobs.
0138	Donald Trump	They gave them away.
0139	Donald Trump	We don't need advice from the Washington swamp.
0140	Donald Trump	We need to drain the swamp.
0141	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0142	Donald Trump	Washington is full of people who are only looking out for themselves.
0143	Donald Trump	You know it better than most.
0144	Donald Trump	I didn't come to Washington for me.
0145	Donald Trump	I came to Washington for all of you.
0146	Donald Trump	That I can tell you.
0147	SYSTEM	[Applause]
0148	Donald Trump	Your dreams are my dreams.
0149	Donald Trump	Your hopes are my hopes.
0150	Donald Trump	And your future is what I'm fighting for each and every day.
0151	Donald Trump	The question for Democrats  all Democrats, including those in Congress, is whether they are on the side of the voters or are they on the side of the special interests?
0152	Donald Trump	The reason why Democrats only talk about at the totally made up Russia story is because they have no message, no agenda, and no vision.
0153	Donald Trump	They don't talk about the all time high stock market.
0154	Donald Trump	They don't talk about reforms to the V.A.
0155	Donald Trump	Or about manufacturing jobs we're bringing back to America by the hundreds of thousands.
0156	Donald Trump	They don't talk about the Keystone pipeline that I immediately approved or the Dakota Access Pipeline.
0157	Donald Trump	Russia story is a total fabrication.
0158	Donald Trump	It is just an excuse for the greatest loss in the history of American politics.
0159	Donald Trump	That's all it is.
0160	Donald Trump	It is just makes them feel better what they have nothing else to talk about.
0161	Donald Trump	What the prosecutor should be look at are Hillary Clinton's 33,000 deleted emails, and they should be looking at the paid Russian speeches.
0162	Donald Trump	And the owned Russian companies.
0163	Donald Trump	Or let them look at at the uranium she sold that's now in the hands of very angry Russian.
0164	Donald Trump	Most people know there were no Russians in our campaign.
0165	Donald Trump	There never were.
0166	Donald Trump	We didn't win because of Russia.
0167	Donald Trump	We won because of you.
0168	Donald Trump	That I can tell you.
0169	Donald Trump	We won because we totally out worked the other side.
0170	Donald Trump	We won because millions of patriotic Americans voted to take back their country.
0171	Donald Trump	Have you seen any Russians in West Virginia or Ohio or Pennsylvania?
0172	Donald Trump	Are there any Russians here tonight?
0173	Donald Trump	Any Russians?
0174	Donald Trump	They can't beat us at the voting booths.
0175	Donald Trump	They are trying to cheat you out of the future and the future that you want.
0176	Donald Trump	They are trying to cheat you out of the leadership that you want with a fake story that is demeaning to all of us and most importantly, demeaning to our country and demeaning to our Constitution.
0177	Donald Trump	I just hope the final determination is a truly honest one.
0178	Donald Trump	Which is what at the the millions of people who gave us our big win in November deserve.
0179	Donald Trump	And what all Americans who want a better future want and deserve Democrat lawmakers will have to decide.
0180	Donald Trump	They can continue their obsession with the Russian hoax, or they can serve the interests of the American people.
0181	Donald Trump	Try winning a the voter booth.
0182	Donald Trump	Try winning at the voter booth.
0183	Donald Trump	Not going to be easy.
0184	Donald Trump	But that's the way you are supposed to do it.
0185	Donald Trump	Our agenda is the progrowth agenda.
0186	Donald Trump	We want to control our boarders and lift our people from welfare to work.
0187	Donald Trump	We want to support our police and make our communities safe.
0188	Donald Trump	We want to reduce taxes and increase wages for all of our people.
0189	Donald Trump	We want to get the special interest out of politics for good.
0190	Donald Trump	And we want to bring back our plants and our factories and our manufacturing and that's what is happening right now.
0191	Donald Trump	You see it, and so does every other state in our union.
0192	Donald Trump	That is why in the proud tradition of America's great leaders from Washington to Lincoln to Teddy Roosevelt, we are protecting American workers and we are protecting American industry for the first time in many, many decades.
0193	Donald Trump	No longer will we allow other considerations to close our jobs, steal our factories, and drain our wealth.
0194	Donald Trump	We are building our future with American labor and hands and aluminum and steel and, what else, coal.
0195	Donald Trump	We will buy American and we will hire American.
0196	Donald Trump	To protect our jobs and our industry, I withdrew the United States from the horrible TransPacific Partnership.
0197	Donald Trump	And to protect our workers and coal miners, I also withdrew the United States from the jobkilling Paris Climate Accord.
0198	Donald Trump	But not only are we bringing back our jobs, we are bringing back our safety.
0199	Donald Trump	We have seen the bloodshed and devastation inflicted by terrorists in America, in Europe, and all across the world I said it during the campaign.
0200	Donald Trump	I will say it again right here tonight.
0201	Donald Trump	We will keep radical, Islamic terrorists out of our country.
0202	SYSTEM	[Applause, Crowd chants USA]
0203	Donald Trump	we only want to admit people in our country who love our people and who share our values.
0204	Donald Trump	We're also keeping our country safe from criminal gangs and violent crime.
0205	Donald Trump	We are taking the fight to the drug smugglers.
0206	Donald Trump	Human traffickers.
0207	Donald Trump	And the vile criminal cartels like MS13 who are being thrown out of our country so quickly you can't even count.
0208	Donald Trump	Just last week I visited Long Island.
0209	Donald Trump	MS13 has brought violence to a oncepeaceful and beautiful neighborhood right where I grew up.
0210	Donald Trump	We are liberating American communities from the vicious, violent gangs.
0211	Donald Trump	One by one we're finding the drug dealers, gang members, thieves, criminals, and predators, and we're throwing them out of our country.
0212	Donald Trump	Once they are gone, we will not let them back in.
0213	Donald Trump	We are stopping drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth.
0214	Donald Trump	You have a big problem in West Virginia and we are going to solve that problem.
0215	Donald Trump	We are cracking down strongly on sanctuary cities that shield criminal aliens.
0216	Donald Trump	And in order to stop the drugs, gangs, and traffickers, we are building a wall on the southern border.
0217	Donald Trump	I also proudly announced legislation this week with Senators Tom Cotton and David Perdue to perform our immigration system to protect American workers and American taxpayers.
0218	Donald Trump	It is called the raise act.
0219	Donald Trump	RAISE.
0220	Donald Trump	The Raise Act.
0221	Donald Trump	For many years America has issued most of the green cards to lowerskilled immigrants.
0222	Donald Trump	And people who had no hope of getting a job.
0223	Donald Trump	Undermining blue collar workers and wages and costing taxpayers billions and billions of dollars a year.
0224	Donald Trump	The Raise Act switches to a meritbased system.
0225	Donald Trump	You come in largely based on merit.
0226	Donald Trump	Doesn't that sound nice?
0227	Donald Trump	Wouldn't that be nice?
0228	Donald Trump	It is about time.
0229	Donald Trump	Our proposal prevents new immigrants from going on welfare for at least five years.
0230	Donald Trump	So you don't come in and go on welfare.
0231	Donald Trump	Our plan favors applicants who can speak English, who can support themselves financially, and who demonstrate valuable skills that will strengthen our economy and strengthen our country.
0232	Donald Trump	We believe decisions on who immigrants are in our country should be based on the best interest of America and the best interest of the American people.
0233	Donald Trump	You.
0234	Donald Trump	We are working to honor millions and million of workers who came out and voted for us.
0235	Donald Trump	That's why I will repeat again tonight that Congress must do its job, keep its promise, live up to its were, and repeal and replace Obamacare.
0236	Donald Trump	You have to do it.
0237	Donald Trump	Fog in life is easy.
0238	Donald Trump	But Congress must not give in.
0239	Donald Trump	They must not give up.
0240	Donald Trump	But instead, Congress must get to work and deliver Americans the great health care that they deserve, the great repeal and replace that they've been talking about for seven years.
0241	Donald Trump	Incredible.
0242	Donald Trump	One vote.
0243	Donald Trump	Incredible.
0244	Donald Trump	But we'll get it.
0245	Donald Trump	We'll get it, folks.
0246	Donald Trump	They can't give up.
0247	Donald Trump	Call your Congressman, call your Senators, call everybody.
0248	Donald Trump	Get them to have the guts to vote to repeal and replace Obamacare.
0249	Donald Trump	Which is a disaster.
0250	Donald Trump	To be a prosperous nation, it is critical we lower the tax burden on our workers and businesses.
0251	Donald Trump	The United States has the highest tax rate on business anywhere in the world.
0252	Donald Trump	We want to bring it down to one of the lowest, because we want more growth, more jobs, and high er pay.
0253	Donald Trump	That's what's doing to happen.
0254	Donald Trump	And importantly, we also want to let Americans keep more of their own money.
0255	Donald Trump	Not take it from them.
0256	Donald Trump	It is time to pass a tax cut for middle class families.
0257	Donald Trump	Finally, and you'll see very soon what you are hearing about it, my administration is committed to rebuilding the deleted infrastructure of the United States.
0258	Donald Trump	Think of it.
0259	Donald Trump	We've spent six trillion dollars in the Middle East and the Middle East is a hundred times worse than it was 16 years ago when we started.
0260	Donald Trump	Can you believe this?
0261	Donald Trump	What a shame.
0262	Donald Trump	That's why we are pushing a $1 trillion new infrastructure investment bill.
0263	Donald Trump	We're going to fix our roads, we're going to fix our bridges, we're going to fix our highways and our schools and our airports we will create amazing monuments that inspire awe and wonder in our people.
0264	Donald Trump	It used to be that way.
0265	Donald Trump	It is not that way any longer.
0266	Donald Trump	We have airports that look like third world countries.
0267	Donald Trump	It is not going to be that way anymore.
0268	Donald Trump	American workers will build this great future.
0269	Donald Trump	And American energy and American clean coal will power this future.
0270	Donald Trump	We are the nation that put a man on the moon that dug out the Panama Canal, and that won two world wars.
0271	Donald Trump	We can do anything, we can build anything with and we can dream anything.
0272	Donald Trump	We share one home and one glorious destination.
0273	Donald Trump	Where we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood.
0274	Donald Trump	We all salute that same great American flag.
0275	Donald Trump	And we are all made by the same almighty God.
0276	Donald Trump	As long as we remember these truths and who we are and what we are fighting for, we will never fail.
0277	Donald Trump	America will triumph.
0278	Donald Trump	Freedom will prevail.
0279	Donald Trump	Our values will endure.
0280	Donald Trump	Our citizens will prosper.
0281	Donald Trump	And our nation will thrive as never before.
0282	Donald Trump	With patriotism in our soul and with love for West Virginia in our hearts, we say these words again tonight.
0283	Donald Trump	We will make America strong again.
0284	Donald Trump	We will make America wealthy again.
0285	Donald Trump	We will make America proud again we will make America safe again.
0286	Donald Trump	And we will make America great again.
0287	Donald Trump	Thank you, West Virginia.
0288	Donald Trump	God bless you.
0289	Donald Trump	Thank you.
0290	Donald Trump	Thank you.
