Challenger Rick Kriseman, former city council member and state legislator, took every opportunity to point out ways he felt Foster\u2019s leadership has been lacking, especially when it comes to economic development.\nAmong his claims, Kriseman said: \"Since Mr. Foster's been mayor, we have less small businesses in the city of St. Petersburg.\"\nWe wanted to dig into St. Petersburg small business statistics to find out if Kriseman was right. (We examined other claims by Kriseman here and by Foster here.)\nKriseman\u2019s campaign manager, Cesar Fernandez, referred us to the City of St. Petersburg Business Tax Division. The office collects taxes from each business in the city.\nWhen sifting through the data with city officials, we learned there are a number of different ways to define \"small business.\"\nUniversity of South Florida St. Petersburg economics professor Suzanne Dieringer said the number of small businesses would vary based on how it's measured. Even when experts agree to define a small business by number of employees, there\u2019s no consensus among experts about which number to use.\n\"I think if you ask six economists what\u2019s the size of a small business you\u2019d get six different answers,\" said City Council Chairman Karl Nurse.\nThe U.S. Small Business Administration says any business with fewer than 500 employees fits the bill. By the SBA definition, over 90 percent of businesses in the city would be considered small.\nNurse said it\u2019s not necessarily the number of small businesses that\u2019s important to assess economic growth, but rather the total revenue the city pulls in from business taxes.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe city taxes businesses differently depending on the type. Many businesses are taxed by number of employees. Businesses with more than 30 employees must pay an additional fee for each employee, starting with No. 31.\nBut there are other means of taxing as well. For example, warehouses are taxed by their square footage and piano instructors by the number of students they have.\nTammy Jerome, the city\u2019s director of billing and collections, said there\u2019s no clear-cut way to define what makes a small business by things like square footage or amount of inventory, so it\u2019d be difficult to get an accurate count of the small businesses in town.\nBecause different businesses are taxed in different ways, calculating the number of small businesses by looking at each business that files taxes and indicates employing fewer than 500 people would leave out small businesses that pay taxes to the city based on other metrics.\nSince most businesses in St. Petersburg employ fewer than 500 people, we can use the total number of businesses and the total amount of tax money they pull in for the city to get an imperfect picture of how the climate for small businesses has changed during Foster\u2019s term.\nHere\u2019s how much revenue the city has generated from this policy by year, according to Jerome. We\u2019ll start with 2009 because\u00a0Fernandez said Kriseman was referring to the number of small businesses before Foster took office in 2010, but the wording of Kriseman's forum statement would lead viewers to believe he meant 2010, not 2009. The 2013 numbers we're using aren't yet final.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n\n\n\n\nRevenues\n$2,596,245\n$2,405,903\n$2,407,083\n$2,409,290\n$2,446,970\n\n\nBusinesses\n15,768\n15,498\n15,103\n15,923\n15,520\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nWhile the revenue\u2019s clearly gone up since 2010, the number of businesses has taken a bumpier path. The city\u2019s unfinalized number of 15,520, is higher than the 2010 number, but not by much. Experts can\u2019t say for sure if the number of small businesses specifically increased or decreased. Since 2010, the revenue the city\u2019s earned from business taxes has gone up, which contradicts the point Kriseman tried to make about the economic state of the city. If he had clearly used 2009 in his talking point, he would've been more on target.\nOur ruling\nKriseman criticized his mayoral race opponent, saying there are fewer small businesses in St. Petersburg than there were when Mayor Foster took office. But the available data leads us to believe that the number of businesses, and the city\u2019s revenue from those businesses, have actually increased. There are lots of different ways to define what constitutes a small business, but experts told us most city businesses could be considered small. Based on the available data, we rate Kriseman's claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08744"}
