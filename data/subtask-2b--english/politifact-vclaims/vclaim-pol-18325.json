(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nIn the interview, Gates spoke theoretically about how many people might experience side effects from a yet-to-be-developed coronavirus vaccine.\u00a0\nHe did not say anything about people dying from such a vaccine.\nThe Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has pledged millions of dollars to companies developing potential novel coronavirus vaccines. There is no evidence that the foundation stands to profit from these efforts.\u00a0\nReaders of the article were instructed to go to minute 2:35 of a video that\u2019s embedded in the article. The video is a 4-minute clip of an interview Gates did April 9 on CNBC about the work his foundation is doing to fight COVID-19. CNBC posted the clip on YouTube. It has been viewed more than 74,000 times.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 25, 2021 in a blog post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWHO now saying you do not need to wear a mask.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGates mentions needing about 7 billion doses worldwide and says:\n\"The efficacy in vaccines in older people is always a huge challenge. It turns out the flu vaccine isn\u2019t that effective in elderly people; most of the benefit comes from younger people not spreading it because they\u2019re vaccinated, and that benefits, on a community basis, the elderly.\n\"Here, we clearly need a vaccine that works in the upper age range because they\u2019re most at risk of that. And doing that so that you amp it up so it works in older people, and yet you don\u2019t have side effects. If we have one in 10,000 side effects, that\u2019s way more \u2014 700,000 people who will suffer from that.\u00a0\n\"So, really understanding the safety at gigantic scale across all age ranges \u2014 pregnant, male, female, undernourished, existing comorbidities \u2014 it\u2019s very, very hard. And that actual decision of, OK, let\u2019s go and give this vaccine to the entire world \u2014 governments will have to be involved because there will be some risk and indemnification needed before that can be decided on.\"\nGates makes no mention of anyone dying from the vaccine.\nHe\u2019s referring to side effects and suggests, theoretically, that if 7 billion vaccines are administered and one in 10,000 people experience side effects, that would mean 700,000 people experiencing side effects.\n(The full 26-minute interview is here.)\nThis claim is false and ridiculous \u2014 Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18325"}
