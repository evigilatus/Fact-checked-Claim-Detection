Jerry Brown reeled off statistics on California\u2019s prison spending during his final State of the State Address after a total of 16 years as governor.\nBrown, who has followed a federal court order to reduce the state\u2019s prison overcrowding, warned legislators at the state Capitol not to simply pass more crime laws but instead consider a holistic approach to criminal justice.\nHe suggested California has gone too far on prison spending since 1970.\n\"The corrections budget then was about 3 percent of the general fund. Now, it\u2019s 8.9 percent, about $12 billion,\" Brown said.\nWas the governor right? Has California\u2019s prison spending nearly tripled as a share of the state\u2019s general fund budget since 1970?\nWe set out on a fact check.\nOur research\nCalifornia\u2019s 1970-71 fiscal year budget, produced under then Gov. Ronald Reagan, backs up the first part of Brown\u2019s claim. It lists the corrections department as 2.8 percent, or nearly $40 million, of the state\u2019s $1.4 billion general fund budget that year.\nCalifornia's 1970-71 fiscal year budget.\nBrown\u2019s 2018-19 budget proposal, meanwhile, also supports the claim. It shows the state expects to spend 9 percent, or nearly $12 billion, of its $132 billion general fund on the corrections department. That\u2019s up about $1 billion from prison spending two years ago.\nFranklin Zimring, a UC Berkeley criminal justice professor, called Brown\u2019s claim about the increased share of prison spending \"absolutely true.\"\n\"California\u2019s prison population exploded from 1980 through the late 1990s and prison building metastasized in the state,\" Zimring said. \"We went from a little over 24,000 prisoners in California prisons to over 170,000 prisoners in 2010 and 2011.\"\nZimring attributed the increase to the state\u2019s booming population during that period, tough sentencing laws, particularly 1994\u2019s Three Strikes law, and the national focus on drug crimes.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFewer inmates, higher costs\nCalifornia has sharply cut its prison population following a 2009 U.S. Supreme Court order for California to reduce prison overcrowding. The population reached a peak of 163,000 inmates in 2006, according to the Public Policy Institute of California. The state estimates it will house an average of about 119,000 prisoners this year.\nBut as the inmate numbers have dropped, state corrections spending has continued to rise. That\u2019s, in part, because California has the highest per capita inmate cost in the nation, at an estimated $80,000 annually for 2018-19, as we examined in a recent fact check. There\u2019s been no corresponding reduction in prison staff as inmate numbers have fallen, causing per capita costs to spike. At the same time, prison staffing costs have increased.\nJeffrey Callison, a state prisons spokesman, told us the conditions of the court order prevent California from closing prisons even as the inmate population is reduced.\n\"So long as the order is in effect we cannot close prisons because to do so would reduce our capacity, thereby pushing us back above 137.5 percent\" level of prison crowding, Callison said in an email. That level is tied to prison capacity and defined by the court, he said.\nOur ruling\nGov. Jerry Brown recently claimed California\u2019s corrections budget in 1970 was \"about 3 percent of the general fund. Now, it\u2019s 8.9 percent, about $12 billion.\"\nCalifornia\u2019s 1970-71 fiscal year budget supports the first part of Brown\u2019s claim, listing prison system spending as 2.8 percent of that year\u2019s general fund.\nBrown\u2019s budget proposal for this fiscal year, meanwhile, shows the corrections department is now estimated to be 9 percent of the general fund, or $12 billion.\nA UC Berkeley criminal justice professor told us the governor\u2019s spending claim rings true, noting the state\u2019s prison population exploded during the 1980s and 1990s, driven by the state\u2019s overall population boom, strict criminal sentencing laws and a national focus on drug crimes. \u00a0\nThe governor\u2019s numbers are on the mark and there\u2019s nothing significant missing from his statement.\nWe rate Brown\u2019s claim True.\n\nTRUE\u00a0\u2013 The statement is accurate and there\u2019s nothing significant missing.\nClick here for\u00a0more\u00a0on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.\n Share the Facts 2018-01-26 02:26:39 UTC   PolitiFact    6 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: True  California\u2019s prisons budget in 1970 \"was about 3 percent of the general fund.
