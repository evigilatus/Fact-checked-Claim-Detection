Some of Sunday\u2019s Oscar winners issued sincere pleas for wage equality, suicide prevention and calling your parents, not to mention lingering racial injustice 50 years after the civil rights movement.\nMusicians John Legend and Common left the audience with a tear-inducing performance of their Oscar-winning Selma anthem \"Glory\" and then a powerful message about setbacks for black Americans in voting rights, police relations and imprisonment.\n\"We know that right now the struggle for freedom and justice is real. We live in the most incarcerated country in the world,\" Legend said. \"There are more black men under correctional control today than there were under slavery in 1850.\"\nAs for Legend\u2019s latter claim, it is true in terms of raw numbers. There are almost double the number of African-American men under state and federal criminal justice supervision as male slaves in 1850 \u2014 about 1.68 million prisoners compared to about 873,000\u00a0slaves. (The claim isn\u2019t as solid if you adjust for the share of the black population.)\nPunditFact wanted to take a closer look at the first half of Legend\u2019s first claim. Is the United States really the most incarcerated country in the world?\nThe London-based International Centre for Prison Studies is the best resource for comparing worldwide prison statistics, experts said, pointing to the group\u2019s World Prison Brief, which is updated monthly as data becomes available.\nThe United States led the world in raw numbers, with 2.23 million prisoners at the end of 2012.\nMore than half of those prisoners were held in state prisons, followed by people held at local jails, federal prisons, juvenile detention facilities, military and U.S. territorial prisons, immigration detention facilities, and Indian country jails, according to a breakdown of the center\u2019s data performed by the Prison Policy Initiative, a nonprofit group that supports reducing the prison population.\nRanking just below the United States is China at 1.7 million, Russia at 671,700, Brazil at 581,500, and India at about 412,000.\nChina\u2019s population could very well be higher, the center notes. Chinese government officials reported in 2009 that more than 650,000 people were being held in detention centers around China on top of the count for sentenced prisoners. If that number was the same in mid 2013, the total prison population would be more than 2.35 million in China, pushing it above the United States.\nBut we can\u2019t settle that possibility here.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in remarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA better way to compare prison populations worldwide is to measure a country\u2019s prison population as a share of the national population, experts told us.\nAdjusted for population, the United States\u2019 prison population (707 prisoners per 100,000 population) exceeds countries around its size, including China.\nBut according to the latest data, it ranks second -- not first -- worldwide. That distinction goes to the tiny nation of Seychelles, which posts the highest rate of 868 prisoners per 100,000 population based on the most recent data.\nPeter Wagner, executive director of the Prison Policy Initiative, said he would not ding Legend \u00a0for not accounting for Seychelles. The countries are not at all in the same league.\nSeychelles is a group of African islands in the Indian Ocean northeast of Madagascar and is home to just over 90,000 people. For perspective, the least populous U.S. state is Wyoming with more than 580,000 residents.\nThe addition of 240 Seychellois from 2012 to 2014 into an already small prison population dramatically pushes the rate from 707 prisoners per 100,000 population\u00a0to 868, overtaking the United States.\n\"I think countries that small are just not comparable,\" Wagner said, adding that his group\u2019s 2014 States of Incarceration report filtered out countries with less than a half-million residents.\nWhat sets American prisons apart from the rest of the world?\n\"We\u2019ve criminalized so much behavior,\" said University of South Carolina criminology professor Geoff Alpert, singling out sentences for drug and property offenses in particular.\nOur ruling\nLegend said, \"We live in the most incarcerated country in the world.\"\nThe United States far and away incarcerates more people than its peers, in terms of the portion of its population behind bars, despite having a comparable amount of crime.\nOnly Seychelles technically has a higher incarceration rate than the United States. But experts said it\u2019s an outlier because of its miniscule size and largely should be disregarded.\nMaybe so, but it is a point at least worth noting.
