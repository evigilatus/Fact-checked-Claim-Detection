  "vclaim": "A family\u2019s dog trots into the yard carrying the corpse of their neighbor\u2019s pet rabbit in its jaws.  The dog\u2019s owners wash and blow dry the dead rabbit to give it the appearance of life, then sneak into the neighbors\u2019 yard and return it to its cage.  The neighbors are horrified when they discover that some sick person has dug up their rabbit (it had died the day before) and put it back in the cage."
