Here\u2019s one of them: Was Clinton wearing an earpiece?\n\"Has Hillary Been Caught Cheating (Again)?\" asked Charisma News, a Christian political website. \"Was Hillary Wired for Trump Debate?\" asked the conservative website World Net Daily. The U.K.-based Express website summarized, \"Did Hillary Clinton wear an earpiece to CHEAT the US debate? Conspiracy theory sweeps web.\"\nIt\u2019s not the first time Clinton has faced such suggestions. As Snopes.com has noted, some questioned whether Clinton had been wearing one at NBC\u2019s commander-in-chief forum on Sept. 7. Snopes concluded that there was \"nothing unusual\" and what viewers were seeing \"most likely captured a light source temporarily reflecting on Clinton's ear.\"\nA reader suggested we check out what happened at the first debate -- an even higher-profile event with upward\u00a0of 80 million Americans watching. So we will. (Snopes gave a False rating to a related claim that Clinton had a bulge in the back of her jacket at the debate that could have been a \"coughing prevention machine.\")\nThe original post, at Charisma News, said the device \"was meant to match her skin tone almost perfectly.\" The article speculated that the device could be a hearing aid, an \"inductive earpiece\" used by actors to better hear cues, or an \"anti-seizure device.\"\n\"None of these paint a particularly good picture for the Democratic presidential nominee. Either she has an as-yet undisclosed health condition, ranging from mild to severe, or she's been cheating during the televised debates,\" the article says.\nFor the record, Clinton campaign spokesman Josh Schwerin told PolitiFact that Clinton \"was not wearing an earpiece.\" Asked whether she has a hearing aid, he said, \"No.\"\nSo, let\u2019s take a look at the original evidence offered -- a Reuters photo and an enlargement that some say show the suspicious, fleshy bulge in Clinton\u2019s ear.\n\nTo be honest, we don\u2019t see any device in this image. (What\u2019s more flesh-like than flesh itself?) But we decided to look at some other images in our wire service archive to see if anything else made her ear look unusual.\nWhen we reached out to Charisma News, an editor suggested that we contact the author of the article. We emailed him the images, but we did not hear back.\nImage 1 (Damon Winter/New York Times)\n\nClose-up\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHogan Gidley\n\n\nstated on January 17, 2021 in a Fox News interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump \u201ccan\u2019t say anything (about the U.S. Capitol riot) because the platforms have removed him.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n By Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 18, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage 2 (Doug Mills/New York Times)\n\nClose-up\n\nImage 3 (Associated Press/David Goldman)\n\nClose-up\n\nImage 4 (Associated Press/David Goldman)\n\nClose-up\n\nIn these four close-ups, we see nothing that mirrors what the original Reuters image showed (which, again, didn\u2019t even look like a device to us). We just see a lot of ear flesh.\nWhen we ran these images by Richard Quindry, a Philadelphia-area photographic and Photoshop expert, he said that only image 2 could even potentially show anything -- the narrow white form inside the ear canal. But even saying that that shape is something other than skin would be speculative at best, he said.\nEach of the other images -- as well as the original Reuters image -- show \"nothing\" to support a claim that she used an earpiece, Quindry said.\nOur ruling\nInternet claims suggested that a debate photograph of Clinton showed her wearing an earpiece. Neither the original photograph presented as evidence nor other enlargements of photographs taken at the debate show anything that looks like an earpiece or a hearing aid.
