The premise: what America\u2019s economy would look like with Trump in charge.\n\"Over the years, he\u2019s said all kinds of things about women in the workforce,\" Clinton said. \"He once called pregnant employees -- and I quote -- \u2018an inconvenience.\u2019 \"\nClinton went on to say that even she was incredulous that Trump made remarks like the \"inconvenience\" statement, despite assurances from her researchers and speechwriters.\nWe searched for the clip.\nTrump\u2019s comment stems from a Dateline NBC interview of Trump from 2004. The segment, \"Blonde Ambition,\" was about Carolyn Kepcher, Trump\u2019s Apprentice sidekick and executive vice president of Trump\u2019s golf properties. Kepcher had just released Carolyn 101, a memoir of her business experience.\nKepcher describes herself as a straight-shooter, but as her Dateline interviewer points out, that seems to conflict with an anecdote in the book in which Kepcher recounts waiting six months before telling Trump that she was pregnant.\n\"You were worried that he might feel inconvenienced?\" the reporter asked.\n\"Maybe, in my mind, he might think perhaps that this might be a setback,\" Kepcher answered.\nWhen the piece turned to Trump, he answered a question that the viewers don\u2019t get to hear, due to editing. \"Well you know, pregnancy is never, um -- it\u2019s a wonderful thing for the woman, it\u2019s a wonderful thing for the husband, it\u2019s certainly an inconvenience for a business. And whether people want to say that or not, the fact is it is an inconvenience for a person that is running a business.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause the viewers don\u2019t hear the question Trump is responding to, and the only other person to use the word \"inconvenience\" was the Dateline reporter, it\u2019s possible that the term may have been introduced as part of the reporter\u2019s question.\nStudies have shown that the costs of accommodating pregnant employees is minimal. The National Women\u2019s Law Center published a fact sheet in 2012 that pointed out that the accommodations employers already provide for disabled employees are much the same as what pregnant women require, only temporarily. And the positive gains -- better recruitment and retention of workers, boosts in productivity, reductions in absenteeism, better workplace safety -- far outweigh any costs, according to the fact sheet.\nTrump\u2019s views on pregnancy didn\u2019t sway Kepcher\u2019s admiration for her former boss. \"If there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned from Donald, it\u2019s to make a decision, make it fast, and stick with it,\" she said.\nTrump certainly didn\u2019t view his daughter Ivanka\u2019s pregnancy as an inconvenience when she stood beside him, well into her third trimester, stumping in New Hampshire and South Carolina. Trump told crowds in both states that he\u2019d love for his daughter to have her baby there.\n\"You know, she had a baby like five days ago,\" Trump said of Ivanka at a March rally in New York, about 10 days after Ivanka gave birth. \"She did a good job. So I should not say Ivanka, you're fired, right? I promise.\"\nWe searched but were unable to find any additional comments made by Trump about women employees becoming pregnant.\nOur ruling\nClinton said that Trump called pregnancy \"an inconvenience\" for business owners. Trump indeed used that word in a 2004 interview with NBC\u2019s Dateline.\n\"The fact is it is an inconvenience for a person that is running a business,\" Trump said.\nClinton\u2019s claim is accurate. We rate it True.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f3498750-e3e7-457c-ba24-b6bca90e01ea", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04782"}
