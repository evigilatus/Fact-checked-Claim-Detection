We decided to look into the claim.\nBackpage, a free classifieds website, has been criticized for promoting prostitution and helping facilitate human trafficking.\nThe company\u2019s CEO,\u00a0Carl Ferrer, was arrested Oct. 6 for pimping a minor.\nIn 2010, Koster and other attorneys general were trying to get the site to remove its adult services page. Backpage has yet to comply. According to the campaign release, Koster ceased any efforts against Backpage following donations from SNR Denton.\nWe reached out to both the Greitens campaign and Koster\u2019s press secretary to compare their versions of the story.\nBattling Backpage\nMuch like Craigslist, Backpage lets users buy and sell items and services online. Unlike Craigslist, which removed adult services in 2010, Backpage still has an adult services section.\nBefore getting into campaign finance, it\u2019s important to understand the timeline of Koster\u2019s work against Backpage, and how that timeline is described by each campaign.\nStarting in 2009, Koster and a growing group of attorneys general began attacking Backpage for allowing advertisements that promoted human trafficking, particularly of minors \u2014 both campaigns agree on that.\nKoster was one of the lead attorneys in a multistate working group trying to get Backpage to shut down its adult services advertising section in September 2010. Spokespersons from both the Greitens campaign and Koster\u2019s office provided\u00a0news releases to back that up.\nIn August 2011, Koster and 44 other attorneys general sent another letter to Backpage, asking for proof the website was actively working to remove sex trafficking advertisements. Both campaigns\u00a0cited that letter as well.\nAnd that\u2019s where the timelines diverge.\nAccording to Greitens\n\"Then suddenly, (Koster) fell silent.\"\nThat\u2019s what the Greitens press release says, at least.\nThe release goes on to cite Koster\u2019s 2011 campaign finance records. On Sept. 1, 2011, the day after the attorneys general requested information on Backpage\u2019s efforts to end sex trafficking, Missourians for Koster received two donations.\nThe first was a $5,000 donation from SNR Denton, a now-dissolved legal and lobbying firm that represented Backpage at the time. The second was a $250 donation from Samuel Fifer, a lawyer with the firm, who also counseled Backpage during the investigation by the attorneys general.\nMissourians for Koster also received two other donations from SNR Denton in 2012, which the Greitens campaign also referenced.\n\"Campaign cash is worth more to Koster than protecting Missouri\u2019s children,\" the release goes on to say.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Boysko\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in a committee debate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe United States is the only industrialized, modernized country that does not already have a paid family medical leave program in place.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s where the press release timeline ends. But we reached out to the Greitens campaign, and staffers pointed out one more piece of Koster\u2019s involvement in investigating Backpage.\nIn June 2013, Koster and two other attorneys general\u00a0sent a letter to attorneys general nationwide. The letter asked attorneys general to sign on to a letter urging Congress to amend the Communications Decency Act of 1996. The Greitens campaign referenced this letter in its research sent to PolitiFact.\nThe proposed amendment, known as the SAVE Act, would close the loophole that makes it easy for websites like Backpage to promote sex trafficking, giving state and local law enforcement jurisdiction over cyber crimes.\nThe actual letter was sent to Congress that July, signed by Koster and 48 other attorneys general. Koster\u2019s office referenced this letter.\nSo, does sending a letter to Congress count as working to end human trafficking? Not if you ask the Greitens campaign.\n\"That\u2019s the problem with career politicians like Chris Koster,\" Greitens campaign manager Austin Chambers\u00a0told the Springfield News-Leader. \"They think sending a letter and a press release counts for doing something.\"\nAccording to Koster\nBut if you ask the attorney general\u2019s office, Koster wasn\u2019t finished with Backpage in 2013.\nOn Oct. 15, 2014, Koster and the National Association of Attorneys General\u00a0sent a letter to Congress\u00a0asking for passage of the Amy and Vicky Act, which would make anyone involved in the sale or distribution of child pornography liable for restitution.\nFive days later, Koster and other attorneys general once again\u00a0asked Congress to pass the SAVE Act, rehashing the sentiment of the June 2013 letter given to us by both Koster and Greitens. The letter, given to us by Koster\u2019s press secretary, directly mentions Backpage.\nAt the state level, in May,\u00a0Koster\u2019s office announced tuition-free training\u00a0for prosecutors and members of law enforcement on how to effectively investigate human trafficking.\nDirty money?\nBut the question still stands: Did Chris Koster abandon efforts to restrict Backpage as a broker of sexual services as the Greitens\u2019s campaign claims?\nIt\u2019s impossible to tell whether the donations caused Koster to ease up on his investigation into Backpage. However, Koster\u2019s office provided us with evidence of continued activity against Backpage, even after the 2011 donations cited by the Greitens campaign.\nIt\u2019s also perfectly legal for lobbying firms to donate to campaigns, said James Klahr, executive director of the Missouri Ethics Commission.\nKlahr said the commission hasn\u2019t analyzed how often or why lobbying firms make contributions, but a quick donor search shows SNR Denton and its employees donated consistently to Missouri campaigns since 2010. Even after merging into the multinational firm Dentons, the company continued political contributions. Dentons represents a\u00a0long list of corporations.\nThe firm isn\u2019t exclusive to Koster. In fact,\u00a0Dentons has donated to Greitens\u2019s charity, The Mission Continues, since at least 2013.\nKoster has not had any ethics complaints related to donations from the firm, and Greitens can\u2019t file a complaint, because the contributions were made more than two years ago, beyond the statute of limitations for ethics complaints.\nBut, this isn\u2019t Koster\u2019s first time getting tangled in legal and lobbyist firm meddling.\u00a0A 2014 investigation by The New York Times\u00a0found that in 2013, successful lobbying by the law firm representing 5-Hour Energy led to Koster ending an investigation into false advertising by the company. Such practice is common for attorneys general across the country, the investigation found.\nHowever, one month after the Times article,\u00a0Koster\u2019s campaign decided to stop receiving contributions from lobbyistsconnected to anyone involved in litigation with the attorney general\u2019s office. According to campaign spokesman David Turner, the campaign returned more than $115,000 since implementing the policy.\nKoster\u2019s campaign did not receive any contributions from Dentons after 2014.\nOur rating\nGreitens said Koster \"fell silent\" as attorney general in pursuing a case against a free classified service accused of promoting prostitution after accepting \"over $12,000 in campaign contributions\" from people affiliated with the service.\nA lobbying firm that represents the classified service, SNR Denton, and its employees contributed to Koster\u2019s campaign.\nKoster\u2019s office didn\u2019t end its efforts to restrict Backpage after the donations were made. Greitens\u2019 campaign says Koster\u2019s efforts were hollow. But that\u2019s up for interpretation.\nThe statement contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.\nWe rate the statement Mostly False.\n\n\u00a0\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6b71d872-9f1a-40e6-a5ef-59c99ba75040", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04002"}
