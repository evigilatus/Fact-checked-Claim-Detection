Some Republicans have expressed concern that the southern border is so easy to penetrate, which could lead to the infiltration of members of the extremist group into the United States of America from Mexico. Some have said that such a conspiracy already exists in business -- but federal agencies disagree. Representative Trent Franks, a Republican from Arizona, said that his country was facing an imminent threat at a recent telephone conference with non-profit conservatives who remained honest with American national destiny. Bazved picked up Franks' comment, and made his way around the Internet. \"Right, we know that ISIS is in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez or that they've been in the last few weeks,\" said Franks. \"There is no doubt, therefore, that they have designs on trying to come to Arizona. My comment is that if unaccompanied minors can cross the border, trained terrorists can, as well. It's a real thing.\" Several other politicians made similar allegations, including the Government of Texas. Rick Perry, Republic of Le Barleta, R-PA, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. Allegations spread about the media preserving the Internet, such as the Daily Caller newspaper, Breitbart News and Pundit Sean Hannity in Fox News. These clashes with the Federal Government &apos; s assertion that there is currently no credible threat that ISIS is planning an attack on United States territory. With Franks and many others claiming that the threat was certain and imminent, we decided to see whether their evidence was reliable or not. On the basis of our discussions with experts and statements by law enforcement officials, it seems unlikely that the U.S. Islamic State will attack through the southern border. The certainty that Franks proposes about what we know is wrong. In a statement by PoliticFact, Franks said that he had obtained information from an online report. Franks has since learned that internal security believes that the report is \"exaggerated,\" and his subsequent comments reflect this -- although he remains concerned about the possibility of terrorists crossing the border. The report is from the Judicial Monitoring Site, a conservative information site, which claims that \"Islamic terrorist groups operate in the Mexican border city of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez and plan to attack the United States with car bombs or other improvised explosive devices, citing many unknown persons \"enforcement of high-level federal law, intelligence and other sources.\" We have not been able to find any other media outlets that independently investigate the story, nor will any federal officials support its allegations. Without knowing anything about sources of judicial control - such as rank or agency - it is difficult for us to assess the credibility of the article. In an interview with Polyte Fact, Chief Justice Tom Feyton did not go to any other details. According to the article, the Ministry of Internal Security did not respond to their numerous requests. We asked Homeland Security about the threat in Ju\u00e1rez, and they said, \"There is no reliable intelligence to indicate that there is an active plot by ISIS to try to cross the southern border.\" This subject was raised several times at recent congressional hearings, and managers reiterated that there was no evidence of imminent threat. At the September 10th meeting before the Border and Maritime Security Subcommittee, Rep. Lo Barleta, R-PA, said, \"We know that terrorist networks use our porous southern border and broken immigration regime to enter the United States.\" The Deputy Under-Secretary of the Ministry of National Security responded to Jennifer Lasley's analysis. \"To date, we have no credible reports that Hizbullah or any other terrorist group has exploited our borders to move individuals inside and out,\" said Lassley. \"It's something we've always been looking for, but so far, we haven't seen reliable evidence of that.\" Later in the same meeting, Rip Beto Orroc, D-Texas, discussed his talks with the Department of Homeland Security, when managers told him that there was no evidence of terrorists entering the United States across the southern border. The same question was put to the directors of the Ministry of National Security present at the hearing. In response, John Wagner, Acting Assistant Commissioner of the Office of Field Operations for Customs and Border Patrols, said that ISIS and other Islamic extremists were more likely to come to the United States on a commercial plane. Wagner said that the number of persons suspected of involvement in terrorist activity, arrested at the southern border, was dozens, while the number of persons travelling on commercial jets was thousands. The Republic of Franks and Feyton have both stated from our judicial supervision that the Government has intercepted the social media sites of the Islamic State, which have indicated that there is a potential for an attack by crossing the border. On February 1, 2021, Tom Cotton mentioned in an interview with Fox and friends \"Many of these arriving immigrants, we have no way of checking their background for either health or security.\" \u25cf February 3, 2012, this appeared at a hearing of the Senate Internal Security Committee on September 10. The Under-Secretary of Intelligence and Analysis, Frances Taylor, asked about recent reports of Twitter and Facebook exchanges in which ISIS \"propelled infiltration\" across the United States-Mexico border. \"Yes, sir, there was Twitter, social media exchange among members of the Islamic State worldwide speaking of that as a possibility,\" said Taylor, \"I'm satisfied that we have intelligence and the capacity of our borders that would prevent that activity.\" This recognition has stimulated discussions in the conservative media. But threats to social media should be taken with a salt pill, said Colin Clarke, an international security expert at rand, \"And ISIL can say, \"We'll never think across the border, will we take that seriously?\" Clark said... \"It's really just a little piece of evidence.\" It is possible, but it is unlikely that we spoke to many national security experts, each of whom said that they did not see credible evidence that ISIS was carrying out a conspiracy involving crossing the southern border. They also said that the scenario was highly unlikely. David Chanzer, Director of the Triangle Center of Duke University on Terrorism and Internal Security, said: \"There is a great difference between theoretical or worrying danger.\" There was a general feeling among experts: ISIL could infiltrate across borders -- illegal immigrants do it every day. But why would they do that? Shanzer noted that ISIS members with American passports or visas could legally enter the country by aircraft. (September 11, kidnappers have the United States) (Visuals) While if they cross the border illegally, they risk being arrested. Another possibility is that someone living in the United States may become a cyber-extremist and then attack, such as the men who carried out the Boston marathon bombings last year, and Clark said that this was his greatest fear. In addition, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria \"has a strong focus\" on Iraq and Syria, as Daniel Benjamin, former Ambassador-General and Counter-Terrorism Coordinator in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said. It is likely that the group does not have the means to launch an attack on United States territory at this stage. In order to cross the border and launch an attack, ISIL will need an extensive network in the United States that can provide them with intelligence, weapons, money, sanctuary, training, etc., and added Clark. This is not a new claim. In 2011, the then presidential candidate Mitt Romney (and many other Republican candidates) said that the Islamic militant Hezbollah group was operating in Mexico, and we appreciated this claim that it was often wrong. (We found some evidence that Hezbollah sympathizers work in South and Central America, but little evidence for the \"work\" group in Mexico. In 2010, the supervisory body published a story entitled \"Feds warning terrorists to infiltrate the United States. Through Mexico.\" The representative of Texas, Aur\u00fcrk, said that he had encountered the story of the 1981 El Paso newspaper about Libyan terrorists in Ju\u00e1rez, although he had never found evidence of this group. Despite years of these allegations, Shanzer said that he was unaware of \"one person arrested for terrorism after illegally crossing the border.\" It should be noted that in 2011, an Iranian planned to assassinate the Ambassador of Saudi Arabia to the United States, and that his plan included Mexican drug traffickers, according to the Washington Post. The man, who used to live in Texas, believed that his contact in Mexico was a drug smuggler, when he was actually the informant of the United States Department of Drug Control. The man was arrested at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, where he flew from Mexico. Our referee Franks said, \"It's true that ISIS is in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez.\" We found it highly unlikely that ISIS would operate in Mexico and launch an attack involving crossing the border. The claims arose in an article with unnamed sources, published by a right-hand window. We have not been able to find a law enforcement official or other media that independently investigates or supports the allegations. It's very difficult to say \"we know\" for sure that ISIS is in Juarez, so we assess this claim as often wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07290"}
