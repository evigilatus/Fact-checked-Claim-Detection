Roy Cooper and the Republican-controlled legislature can\u2019t agree on a plan for public education spending.\nAmid the stalemate, Cooper just got a new talking point.\nOn Jan. 21, he tweeted:\n\"The Court has ordered North Carolina to step up significantly its funding for education,\" the tweet says, adding: \"It should begin now with this budget.\"\nCooper\u2019s tweet provided a link to a story by The News & Observer newspaper in Raleigh.\nThe education budget is usually set by state lawmakers (the House of Representatives and Senate pass a plan, then the governor approves it.)\nSo it might seem odd to the average person that a judge \"ordered\" North Carolina to spend more on education.\nIs that really what happened?\nGenerally speaking, yes. But don\u2019t expect your kid\u2019s public school to receive a shipment of new resources anytime soon.\nA 25-year-old case\nCooper\u2019s tweet references the latest development in what\u2019s known as the \"Leandro case.\" Here\u2019s a brief history, courtesy of the N&O story:\n\n1994: The Leandro family, along with five North Carolina counties, sue the state government on grounds it hasn\u2019t provided enough resources to public schools.\n1997: The state Supreme Court declares that a \"sound basic education\" is guaranteed through the state constitution.\n2004: The state Supreme Court declares that the state still hasn\u2019t provided a sound education to poor children. As the N&O notes,\u00a0\"The court did not prescribe specific solutions; that was left up to legislators and education leaders.\"\n\nFast forward to 2020. The case is now overseen by Superior Court Judge David Lee, and he says the state still isn\u2019t providing public school students with a proper education.\nThe meaning of \u2018order\u2019\nOne thing that may be confusing: Lee\u2019s latest filing is referred to as an order. That is legally what his document is called.\nAnd, while Judge Lee did issue a directive to lawmakers, his orders weren\u2019t specific.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The judge did not enter an order that specifically said \u2018the state of North Carolina must appropriate X number of dollars,\u2019\" said Jane Wettach, a law professor at Duke University and director of the school\u2019s Children\u2019s Law Clinic.\n\"What (the order) did do was say, it\u2019s obligated to do a number of things, essentially to improve to the point of being adequate the education system in North Carolina.\"\nWe looked at the order. And, indeed, it states this on Page 4:\n\"As outlined in greater detail below and in accordance with the Court\u2019s prior rulings, the Court orders the Defendants, in consultation with each other and the Plaintiffs, to work expeditiously and without delay to create and fully implement a definite plan of action to achieve Leandro compliance.\"\nThen on Page 5, Lee says a more specific plan will come later:\n\"This Court will issue a subsequent order or orders regarding the definite plan of action and its critical components, including the identifications of specific, concrete, definitive actions (preliminarily short-term actions and mid-term and long-term action plans) that will be taken to implement the above seven components and to correct the constitutional deficiencies, so that the State may finally meet its constitutional obligations to North Carolina\u2019s children.\"\nJudge Lee based his order on a report by WestEd, an independent firm brought in to examine North Carolina\u2019s education policies.\u00a0\nThe report not only analyzed the state\u2019s spending, but \"further proposes detailed recommendations for increased funding efforts by the State in order for North Carolina's system of public schools to become Leandro compliant,\" said Lindsay Wagner, a senior researcher at the nonpartisan advocacy group: Public School Forum of North Carolina.\u00a0\nWhat comes next\nIn response, the judge\u2019s order tells defendants to craft a plan of action. But \"the order does not explicitly require additional funds, rather it requires that additional resources, \u2018if any,\u2019 to meet the requirements identified,\" Ann McColl, an education attorney.\nThe order said a plan of action must include seven components:\n\nA system of teacher development and recruitment that ensures each classroom is staffed with a high-quality teacher who is supported with early and ongoing professional learning and provided competitive pay.\nA system of principal development and recruitment that ensures each school is led by a high-quality principal who is supported with early and ongoing professional learning and provided competitive pay.\nA finance system that provides adequate, equitable, and predictable funding to school districts and, importantly, adequate resources to address the needs of all North Carolina schools and students, especially at-risk students as defined by the Leandro decisions;\nAn assessment and accountability system that reliably assesses multiple measures of student performance against the Leandra standard and provides accountability consistent with the Leandro standard.\nAn assistance and turnaround function that provides necessary support to low-performing schools and districts.\nA system of early education that provides access to high-quality pre-kindergarten and other early childhood learning opportunities to ensure that all students at-risk of educational failure, regardless of where they live in the State, enter kindergarten on track for school success; and\nAn alignment of high school to postsecondary and career expectations, as well as the provision of early postsecondary and workforce learning opportunities, to ensure student readiness to all students in the State.\n\nThe judge then notes that it's the \"state\u2019s duty\" \u2014 rather than the judiciary\u2019s duty \u2014 to implement the necessary programs. The order directs the parties involved with the case to provide Lee with a status report \"no later than 60 days\" of the order, which was signed Jan. 21.\nMcColl noted that the GOP-controlled General Assembly isn\u2019t named as a party to the case. But it could participate in implementing the plan.\n\"Because the order is to respond with plans for the immediate future (2020) and mid-range and comprehensive plans, there is not a specific order requiring specific action by the General Assembly at this time,\" McColl said.\n\"At a time when specific steps are submitted to the court and the court approves them, there may be specific actions required of the General Assembly,\" McColl added. \"If the GA does not comply with these orders, the court has some tools \u2013 although limited and difficult with a legislative body, to enforce orders.\"\nOur ruling\nCooper tweeted that \"the Court has ordered North Carolina to step up significantly its funding for education.\"\nJudge Lee didn\u2019t give specific instructions for how much lawmakers need to spend on public education. But he did order North Carolina to spend more on its education system. Cooper\u2019s statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.
