Maxine Waters, D-Calif., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. Text written over the images claims the trio has not been very productive during their government careers.\n\"67 combined years. 6 bills passed,\" the post reads.\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It has been shared thousands of times by several different users and pages.\nLike past social media posts, this one is inaccurate.\n\n(Screenshot from Facebook)\nLet\u2019s look at the first claim \u2014\u00a0that Sanders, Pelosi and Waters have served a combined 67 years in Congress.\nSanders was first elected to Congress in 1991 and has served as both a representative and senator. Pelosi was elected in 1987 and has served as both a representative and speaker of the House. Waters has served as a representative since 1991.\nWhen combined, the three lawmakers have served 88 years in Congress \u2014\u00a0actually more than the Facebook post claims.\nOn the second claim, the Facebook post also falls flat. According to GovTrack, a website that keeps tabs on congressional legislation, the lawmakers mentioned in the post have passed more than six bills.\u00a0\nFor this fact-check, we first used the most stringent definition of the word \"passed\" \u2014 legislation that is \"enacted,\" or signed by the president \u2014 to assess the validity of the post. Then we looked at how many sponsored bills had passed at least one chamber of Congress.\nHere is each lawmaker\u2019s legislative record as of Nov. 17:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJake Tapper\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in remarks in a CNN broadcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second presidential impeachment of Donald Trump was \u201cthe most bipartisan impeachment in American history.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.\nPassed: 2\nEnacted: 3\nRep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.\nPassed: 9\nEnacted: 7\nRep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif.\nPassed: 23\nEnacted: 3\nThat puts the lawmakers\u2019 combined enacted bills at 13 \u2014\u00a0not six, as the Facebook post claimed.\nHowever, experts have told us that counting enacted bills is not the only nor the best way to measure lawmaker productivity.\n\"Very few bills are ever enacted \u2014 most legislators sponsor only a handful that are signed into law,\" reads a notice on the GovTrack site. \"But there are other legislative activities that we don\u2019t track that are also important, including offering amendments, committee work and oversight of the other branches, and constituent services.\"\nAdditionally, Pelosi has served as House speaker for seven years, nonconsecutively. That role is more focused on setting the party\u2019s agenda than actually introducing bills, according to GovTrack.\nThe Facebook post is inaccurate.
