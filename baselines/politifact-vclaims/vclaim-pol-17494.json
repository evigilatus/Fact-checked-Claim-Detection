(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nThe story claims that on the Senate floor, Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York \"high-fived and then clasped the hand\" of Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, \"after she voted \u2018no\u2019 on ending debate over the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act.\" The story includes a 27-second C-SPAN video that allegedly shows the celebration.\nWe fact-checked this claim two years ago when a North Dakota political blog similarly claimed that the two senators high-fived after the controversial abortion vote.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe vote in question was to proceed to a motion that would make illegal nearly all abortions after 20 weeks and subject anyone who performed the procedure to prison time or fines.\nSenators voted 51-46 yea-to-nay; Heitkamp was one of the nay votes.\nThe video shows Heitkamp walking into the chamber, responding to the clerk\u2019s roll call in the negative, and chatting with Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J. Schumer approaches them; he and Heitkamp wave hello and clasp each other\u2019s hand. Booker pats Schumer\u2019s shoulder. The senators\u2019 conversation is inaudible.\nAides for Heitkamp and Schumer told PolitiFact in 2018 that the senators were greeting each other and that they did not speak about the vote in their interaction. When Heitkamp and Schumer met, the vote was about halfway through, so the hand clasp was not in reaction to a final tally and their exchange did not look like a high-five.\nHeitkamp lost her bid for re-election in 2018.\nThe headline on LifeSiteNews.com inaccurately claims the senators high-fived in celebration of late-term abortion.
