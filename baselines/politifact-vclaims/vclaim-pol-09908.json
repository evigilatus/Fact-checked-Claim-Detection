John Kitzhaber or the tax folks over at Nike. So, as the governor was testifying on a bill that would allow him to guarantee Nike up to three decades of a single sales tax factor, he tried to be very clear about what it represented.\n\n\"This is not a tax break,\" he said during a committee meeting. \"This does not lower the taxes that Nike will pay nor does it prevent the Legislature from raising those taxes in the future.\"\n\nIn fact, the bill legislators debated allows the governor to guarantee a business that its tax structure will not change for a given period of time in exchange for a promise that the business will make a certain level of investment in the state.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, on paper, the bill does not represent a tax break -- it doesn\u2019t actually change the tax code in any way. That said, much of the discussion regarding the legislation revolved around the state\u2019s single sales factor. That\u2019s because it was clear all along that the governor was going to use the new bill to guarantee Nike decades of that tax apportionment system.\n\nLet\u2019s back up, though, and offer a little context. Companies can generally be taxed, to varying degrees, on three fronts: property, payroll and sales. Before 1991, Oregon weighted all three of those areas equally, but over the past 20 years or so, the state has inched toward taxing certain corporations on just their Oregon sales. That system is called single sales factor apportionment.\n\nThis method can be advantageous for certain companies, reducing the amount of money they owe to the state in a given year. In theory, that reduced tax burden then attracts them to Oregon.\n\nThough there were no signs that Oregon\u2019s apportionment system would be changing anytime soon, Nike wanted an assurance before committing to expanding further in Oregon. That\u2019s why the governor asked the Legislature to pass a bill that would allow him to guarantee the structure for companies poised to make a certain level of investment in the state. (You can read more of those details here.)\n\nWe called University of Oregon economist Tim Duy to get his take. There were two issues here, he said.\n\nThe single sales factor isn\u2019t a break in the strictest sense, but it certainly reduces the amount a company pays in taxes. The 2013-15 Oregon Expenditure Report, the document that tallies up all of the state\u2019s tax giveaways for a biennium, estimates the state will forgo $165 million over the next two years as a result of this tax structure. Now, to be clear, this estimate is a bit squishy, if only because there\u2019s no accounting for behavioral changes that might occur if the single sales factor didn\u2019t exist. Certain companies, like Nike, might invest elsewhere, for instance. There\u2019s no way of knowing for sure.\n\nThe specific break that Nike gets from this system isn\u2019t public information, but a few years back the Oregon Center for Public Policy made an estimate. Using some publicly available information, they estimated that under the single sales factor Nike shaved more than 90 percent (about $17 million at the time) off its tax bill.\n\nObviously, that\u2019s a considerable savings for any company. So what about the governor\u2019s claim that this new law doesn\u2019t represent a tax break?\n\nWell, as Duy pointed out, this is already the method by which the company was being taxed and there was no talk of changing that. \"We're not actually giving up a dollar we're going to get somehow else,\" he said. \"It's not a tax incentive or a rebate of the type we're usually thinking about it.\"\n\nThe governor said the bill he was asking the Legislature to pass was not a tax break. That\u2019s true, the bill does not reduce Nike\u2019s tax burden. But it\u2019s been clear all along that the governor would use the legislation to ensure the continuance of a sizable tax giveaway for Nike. That is an important clarification.\n\nWe rate this claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09908"}
