Rand Paul of Kentucky called the Justice Department\u2019s potential review into whether classified information was mishandled \"damning\" before charging Clinton with hypocrisy.\n\"Even she knew there was a rule,\" Paul said July 26. \"They actually admonished one of her ambassadors because he wasn't using the proper server. I don't understand how she can skate by and act as if she wasn't aware of the law.\"\nWe won\u2019t address here whether Clinton was or wasn\u2019t \"aware of the law.\" But we were curious about Paul\u2019s allegation: Did the State Department under Clinton chide a diplomat for handling email on an improper server in the same way as Clinton?\nThe Clinton campaign declined to comment.\nThe ambassador\nA spokeswoman for Paul told us he was referring to Scott Gration, a former Obama advisor who left his post as ambassador to Kenya three years ago.\nAfter less than a year and half on the job, Gration resigned in June 2012 (while Clinton was secretary)\u00a0after reading a draft of a highly critical audit by the State Department\u2019s Office of the Inspector General, which works independently. Among Gration\u2019s many failings was his continued usage of a personal email account,\u00a0according to the report.\nUnsurprisingly, Gration\u2019s drama resurfaced when the Clinton email controversy first erupted in March 2015, and some claimed that Gration was fired for his \"Hillary-like\" use of the email. (Gration\u00a0used a Gmail account.)\u00a0Gration himself called the State Department\u2019s treatment of him a double standard.\nPunditFact, however, found that most of the reports inflated the significance of the personal email. Gration\u2019s grating style of management, uncooperative attitude and \"disruptive\" initiatives were more pressing to the State Department. Out of more than 80 mission chiefs, he ranked last for interpersonal relations, next to last on managerial skill and attention to morale, and third to last on overall scores, according to the audit.\nCompared to these issues, the email problem\u00a0played a minor role, according to Ronald Neumann, who served as an American ambassador three times, most recently in Afghanistan from 2005-07.\n\"It could be an important issue, but when you screw up as many things as this guy did, it\u2019s hard to get through to that one,\" Neumann told PunditFact.\nThe admonishment \nPaul\u2019s claim, however, is more tempered, and thus more accurate. That audit did indeed \"admonish\" Gration for his email habits.\u00a0The fourth bullet point on the report\u2019s summary reads:\n\"The Ambassador\u2019s greatest weakness is his reluctance to accept clear-cut U.S. Government decisions. He made clear his disagreement with Washington policy decisions and directives concerning the safe-havening in Nairobi of families of Department employees who volunteered to serve in extreme hardship posts; the creation of a freestanding Somalia Unit; and the nonuse of commercial email for official government business, including Sensitive But Unclassified information. Notwithstanding his talk about the importance of mission staff doing the right thing, the Ambassador by deed or word has encouraged it to do the opposite.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHogan Gidley\n\n\nstated on January 17, 2021 in a Fox News interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump \u201ccan\u2019t say anything (about the U.S. Capitol riot) because the platforms have removed him.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 18, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report describes Gration\u2019s actions in detail starting on page 43: He deliberately defied the State Department\u2019s rule on communication by installing a commercial Internet connection in his embassy office bathroom and authorizing his embassy staff to use personal emails.\u00a0\n\"He has willfully disregarded Department regulations on the use of commercial email for official government business,\" the report says.\nArs Technica, a technology news site, put it even more bluntly: \"Gration was the end user from hell for an understaffed IT team in a politically sensitive outpost.\" \u00a0\nThe report also spells out the reasons for the policy: Unauthorized systems increase the risk for hacks and loss of records. It then states that the use of personal emails \"must be limited to maintaining communications during emergencies\" and recommended the embassy stop using the unofficial email accounts.\nIt is unclear if top State Department brass slammed Gration for violating the personal email policy, as Paul suggests. We found no on-the-record condemnations from department officials, though Gration said multiple times that Clinton\u2019s chief of staff fired him after reading the report. An audit by an inspector general is different than Clinton directly criticizing Gration for the practice.\nComparison to Clinton\nIn short, the department\u2019s watchdogs chided Gration for a number of issues, including his personal email use. But how closely did his improper email habits mirror Clinton\u2019s?\nClinton\u00a0exclusively used a personal email account during her tenure as the country\u2019s top diplomat. At the time, there was no law prohibiting the practice (one was put in place in 2014). There was, however, a long-standing policy against using personal emails, reiterated in a 2011 memo from the State Department under Clinton. Gration, for his part, used both, although he \"very infrequently\" logged onto his classified account, the report says.\nWithout more information, it\u2019s hard to compare the security risks of both setups. Gration likely channeled his personal emails through an unsecured Internet connection despite repeated warnings, according to the Washington Post.\nAs for Clinton, her personal email was relayed through a private server guarded by the Secret Service, Clinton said at a March press conference. We don\u2019t know if the State Department signed off on her private server, but it was aware of the server\u2019s existence. The emails were encrypted after March 2009, according to her security provider, though there\u2019s still debate over the account\u2019s security.\nOverall, an expert told us it\u2019s an apples-to-apples comparison, though he cautioned that the inspector general report does not address why Gration was using a personal email. (According to Gration, he couldn\u2019t get news alerts through the official State Department server.)\n\"The similarities between the two situations are striking, and it is fair to compare them,\" said Douglas Cox, a law professor at the City University of New York, who studies records preservation. \"Both were in senior leadership positions. Both made a regrettable decision to use non-official email, which raised security and record-keeping concerns that should have been obvious. And both refused to accept that their continuous use of non-official email violated State Department rules.\"\nCox pointed out that the report condemned Gration\u2019s email usage as a failure in leadership that \"sapped the morale\" of his staff. The same criticism could apply to Clinton, who, as secretary of state, should be held to a higher standard than Gration, Cox argued.\n\"The buck should have stopped with her, and she should have been leading by example,\" he said.\nOur ruling\nPaul said the State Department under Clinton \"actually admonished one of her ambassadors for not using the proper server.\"\nThe ambassador in question, Scott Gration, was effectively fired from his post in Kenya in 2012 mostly because of his poor management skills but also for his email management. The department\u2019s office of the inspector general, which works independently, called Gration\u2019s use of a personal email account for government business a leadership failure and a security risk.\nWe rate Paul\u2019s claim True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06152"}
