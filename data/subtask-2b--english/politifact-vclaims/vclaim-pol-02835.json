Imagine the deaths if the shooter had a silencer, which the NRA wants to make easier to get.\u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 2, 2017\n\nA silencer is the popular name for a suppressor, a canister attached to a gun muzzle that reduces (but doesn\u2019t entirely silence) the sound produced by a gunshot. Some members of Congress have been pushing for legislation that would make it easier for gun owners to use suppressors.\nThe Hearing Protection Act, introduced in the House of Representatives in January, would lower the restrictions on buying suppressors. As it stands, there is an approximately nine-month approval process and a $200 tax stamp. Act proponents want to streamline purchases to match regular firearm purchases.\nWe wondered whether introducing suppressors to the Las Vegas shooting would have indeed increased casualties.\nOur research shows that a suppressor would not have made a difference in the Las Vegas case, because of the positioning of the weapons and because of the distance of the shooter from the crowd. Clinton\u2019s staff provided no evidence to suggest a different outcome.\nHow much quieter would it have been?\nA shooting weapon produces two sounds. One is the crack of the bullet, which can be heard on most video recordings of the shooting and is produced by the bullet traveling faster than the speed of sound. This is unaffected by suppressors.\nSuppressors instead work on the muzzle blast, or the sound the gun barrel produces when it fires.\nA typical gunshot is around 150-160 decibels, a level that can cause hearing damage. Suppressors can reduce that sound by around 20-30 decibels, depending on the gun, ammunition, temperature and even humidity.\nThat\u2019s just below the threshold for instant hearing damage. Experts compared the suppressed sound levels to a jackhammer and a jumbo jet on the tarmac 100 yards away. That\u2019s still fairly loud.\nIt\u2019s important to note that suppressors are intended to lower the sound for the shooter, not the target. Jeremy Mallette, who has researched suppressors for Silencer Shop, estimated the sound of suppressed gunfire would go up 10 to 15 decibels downrange -- making the impact of the suppressor even lower for those on the receiving end.\nCould it have helped in locating the shooter?\nThe gunman shot at the crowd out of windows on the 32nd floor of the hotel and positioned the guns so that they shot outwards.\nIf the shooter\u2019s aim was to lower the sound emissions, the room could have better trapped the noise, according to Tom Satterly, the director of development for Asymmetric Solutions, a firearm training firm based in Missouri.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you hang your weapon outside of your window the muzzle blast is going outside,\" Satterly said. \"If you back in -- a foot or farther -- a lot of that sound is absorbed into the room. That\u2019s what snipers do when they\u2019re trying to hide their position.\"\nSuppressed or not, Mallette said adjacent hotel rooms would have heard the sound very loudly.\nMarty Langley,\u00a0a gun-control advocate and a senior policy analyst at Violence Policy Center, pointed to claims from the silencer industry that if the suppressor masks the sound of the gunshot, then the person being shot at can only hear the ballistic crack after it has whizzed by, causing them to think the fire is coming from the opposite direction.\nHowever, Satterly, an Army veteran with combat experience in Somalia, said that neither he nor his colleagues had ever been able to pinpoint the direction the sound originated from -- an effect that is amplified in a loud, urban area like the Las Vegas strip.\n\"It\u2019s nearly impossible to tell where someone shot you from in an urban environment unless there\u2019s visual cues,\" Satterly said.\nWhich brings us to our next point: Langley also pointed out claims from the industry that silencers make shooters less detectable in the dark.\nThe flash hider that comes with a silencer is designed to minimize the flame the shooter sees coming out of the barrel, which can blind night vision goggles for a couple of seconds. But while it minimizes the flash, it doesn\u2019t eliminate it altogether.\nWhat\u2019s more, it\u2019s a function that can be performed by tools that are already on the market without the same barriers to purchase as suppressors -- and that many rifles are already equipped with.\nLangley also pointed out industry claims that silencers can improve accuracy and enable quicker follow-up shots by reducing recoil. That is, they can decrease the barrel\u2019s rising produced by the pressure and gas of the bullet.\nExperts agreed a suppressor can slightly improve accuracy, but the effect would have been minimal in the indiscriminate shooting seen in Las Vegas.\nOur ruling\nHillary Clinton suggested gun silencers would have worsened the Las Vegas attack in a tweet.\nIt\u2019s certainly possible that silencers or suppressors could make some shootings worse than they would be otherwise. But the specifics of the Las Vegas shooting don\u2019t fit that scenario. Experts told us it\u2019s highly unlikely a silencer would have made the Las Vegas shooting even more deadly, because of the distance of the shooter from the crowds and because of the crowded, urban environment where the victims were targeted.\nGun silencers can slightly lower the visual and sound impact of a shooter, but experts agreed the impact would have been negligible in the case of Las Vegas.\nWe rate this statement False.\nClarification:\u00a0After this report was published, we added language to clarify that Langley was pointing to industry claims about the characteristics of suppressors.\u00a0\n Share the Facts 2017-10-04 15:39:04 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  \"The crowd (in Las Vegas) fled at the sound of gunshots.
