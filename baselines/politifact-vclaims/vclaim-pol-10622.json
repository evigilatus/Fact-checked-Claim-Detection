The latest\u00a0television commercial\u00a0features two women, Dawn and Alex, talking about Romney.\nDawn:\u00a0\"I think Mitt Romney\u2019s really out of touch on women\u2019s health issues.\"\n\nAlex:\u00a0\"This is not the 1950s. Contraception is so important. It\u2019s about a woman being able to make decisions.\" (As she speaks, a picture of Romney appears beside the words \"Opposes requiring employers to cover contraception.\")\n\nDawn:\u00a0\"I don\u2019t remember anyone as extreme as Romney.\"\n\nRomney event video:\u00a0\"I\u2019ll cut off funding for Planned Parenthood.\"\n\nAlex:\u00a0\"I don\u2019t think Mitt Romney can understand the mindset of someone who has to go to Planned Parenthood.\"\n\nRomney interview video:\u00a0\"Planned Parenthood. We\u2019re going to get rid of that.\"\n\nDawn:\u00a0\"I think Mitt Romney would definitely drag us back.\"\n\nThe ad is airing in Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, and Virginia. Given that\u00a0PolitiFact\u00a0recently found\u00a0the Obama campaign exaggerated other claims about Romney on abortion, we thought it would be worthwhile to check the claim that Romney opposes requiring employers to cover contraception and would eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood.\n\nThe contraceptive mandate\n\nRomney\u2019s stance on contraceptive coverage became clear during the Republican primaries. Early this year, congressional Republicans made a big push to roll back a provision of the health care law that requires all employers except religious ones to provide birth-control services without any out-of-pocket costs.\n\nIn the Senate, Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., sponsored an amendment that would exempt employers from providing any service that went against their \"beliefs or moral convictions.\" At the time, the issue put the Obama administration\u00a0on the defensive\u00a0and the president himself appeared at the White House briefing room to explain a work-around for religious affiliated hospitals, universities and the like.\n\nA few weeks later, with a vote on the Blunt amendment pending, Romney was asked where he stood. He told a\u00a0Boston radio\u00a0interviewer \"Of course I support the Blunt amendment.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCNSNews.com, a conservative news service, seeking clarity,\u00a0wrote about putting\u00a0the question directly to the Romney campaign.\n\n\"Will Mitt Romney, on day one, rescind this mandate in its entirety \u2014 as the Catholic Church has urged the current administration to do \u2014 so that individuals, employers and insurers who have a \u2018moral or religious objection to contraception or sterilization\u2019 will not be forced to violate the tenets of their own faith or act against their consciences?\"\n\nRomney campaign spokesman Ryan Williams responded: \"Yes--Gov. Romney would rescind the mandate in its entirety.\"\n\nIn April,\u00a0Romney reiterated his opposition to the current rule at a meeting of the National Rifle Association. He said, \"As president, I will abolish it.\"\n\nWe conclude from those comments that Romney would not just abolish the requirements for religious organizations, but for any employer that had a moral or religious objection.\n\nWhen the new Obama ad first ran, Romney spokeswoman\u00a0Andrea Saul called it a \"false ad,\" but her statement did not provide specifics and the Romney campaign did not respond to our inquiries.\n\nPlanned Parenthood\n\nPlanned Parenthood, a national network of clinics that provide a range of health services including abortion, has been in the\u00a0crosshairs\u00a0of social conservatives for a long time. The federal government pays Planned Parenthood about $75 million a year to offer cancer screenings, breast exams and other care to lower income women. That money cannot be spent on abortion services.\n\nBut conservatives argue that the federal dollars free up money which the organization uses to underwrite the cost of doing abortions. Mitt Romney has linked that concern to his effort to reduce the deficit. \u00a0\n\nAsked by a Missouri\u00a0interviewer\u00a0what he would cut, Romney gave some examples. \"Of course you get rid of\u00a0Obamacare,\" Romney said. \"That\u2019s the easy one. But there are others. Planned Parenthood. We\u2019re going to get rid of that. The subsidy for Amtrak. We would eliminate that.\"\n\nWe should note that the latest Obama ad edits Romney\u2019s words down to \"Planned Parenthood. \u00a0We\u2019re going to get rid of that.\" This might give the impression that Romney plans to do away with Planned Parenthood, an interpretation that forced the Romney campaign to clarify what he meant when he first made the statement in mid-March. Campaign officials said he would eliminate the federal payments to Planned Parenthood but would not be getting rid of the organization. Planned Parenthood is a private entity with a total budget of about $1.1 billion, an amount much larger than the direct federal payment.\n\nRomney has repeated his plan to eliminate federal funding for Planned Parenthood many times. He said it in a letter to voters that was published in\u00a0Life News, a self-described pro-life news service. On his website, he goes further and says he will eliminate all\u00a0family planning\u00a0funds under the Public Health\u00a0Service Act. That program, Title X, costs about $300 million and was created in 1970 under the Nixon administration.\n\nOur Ruling\n\nThe Obama campaign ad said that Mitt Romney opposes requiring employers to cover contraception and would eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood.\n\nRomney has said he would abolish the contraceptive coverage requirement and he has said repeatedly that he would eliminate federal funding for Planned Parenthood. \u00a0\n\nWe rate the statement\u00a0True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10622"}
