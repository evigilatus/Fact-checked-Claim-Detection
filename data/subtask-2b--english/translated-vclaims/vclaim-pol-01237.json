However, while some heard the 1,600-page national climate assessment as a spicy distress call, others were less alarming. On NBC me the Press, Daniel Bletka, an expert in foreign policy at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, allowed climate change to occur, but she was quick to add that she did not know whether it was human-induced. (In fact, scientists say they're the main contributor.) The issue of climate change was subject to \"hysteria.\" Some weather phenomena, such as global cooling periods, were overlooked by the prevailing media narrative. \"We also need to recognize that we have just two of the coolest years, the biggest drop in global temperatures that we have had since the 1980s, the largest per cent of the past year,\" said Bletka during a panel discussion. \"We're not talking about it because it's not part of the agenda.\" Climate scientists have told us that part of Bletka's claim is wrong and part misleading. Blake said: \"Two of the coolest years\" we just had two years of the coldest years recorded. This is wrong. The Director of NASA &apos; s Goddard Institute of Space Studies, Gavin Schmidt, referred to a graph of NASA data showing global average temperatures over time: extreme right points represent global temperatures for 2017 and 2016. According to these data, it is in fact one of the warmer years recorded - which is contrary to this part of the Baltic claim. We note that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which has a slightly different method of calculating temperature, shows 2016 and 2015 as the warmer two years in the Register. In the United States, according to NASA data, 2017 and 2016 were the second and third warmer year. \"The largest drop since the 1980s,\" \"the largest percentage drop in the last 100 years,\" the other part of the Blackca claim - about cold spells - was not as false as it was misleading. In one interview on January 31, 2021, John Kerry stated that Hurricane Harvey \"droped more water in Houston in five days than it fell over Niagara Falls in one year.\" The April 2018 article indicates that from February 2016 to February 2018 (the last month available at that time), global average temperatures decreased by 0.56\u00b0C. We learned that this is technically true, but it ignores the larger trend that has taken place over decades. Schmidt said, \"In essence, it's just a statistical coincidence people caught because it looks good.\" \"It has nothing to do with long-term trends\" Also, the drop in temperatures after 2016 was not surprising, as climate scientists said. The year 2016 was particularly hot because it was at the height of the last El Ni\u00f1o wave, a recurring event when the Pacific surface warmed, leading to a few tenths of global average temperatures. As the event ended, things calmed down. \"So the subsequent drop in temperature is not surprising,\" said Judith Curie, a former climatologist and chair of the Earth and Atmospheric Sciences School at the Georgia Institute of Technology. \"The two-year trend makes no sense in terms of understanding anything about how climate change will change.\" The real obvious article seems to be critical of the lack of coverage of cold spells by major media, which the author claims should be equally covered, such as heat waves and extreme weather events associated with climate change. \"None of this argues against global warming,\" says the author. \"We have just had the coldest two years, the largest drop in global temperatures since the 1980s, the largest drop in the last 100 years,\" said our referee Bletka. Her claim that we were just had two of the coldest years is wrong. At the global level, 2016 and 2017 were the warmer two years registered, according to one measure. Climate scientists have told us that the two-year trend is meaningless in terms of understanding anything about how climate change can change. With that in mind, Blitka's assertion that we have recently witnessed the greatest drop in global temperatures is red herring. It is based on an irrelevant statistical coincidence, compared with long-term trends. In sum: Cold spells can actually occur, but they do not negate the fact that global warming is a real and legitimate cause for concern, according to a broad scientific consensus. We appreciate Blitka's false claim.
