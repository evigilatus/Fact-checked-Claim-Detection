For months, Watkins bragged to voters that he built his own company from scratch, but it was all a lie.\"\nIt is accurate that Watkins did not build and own the company\u2014 VIAP Inc. \u2014 as he has been quoted.\nHowever, the Democrats' ad takes the rhetoric too far saying it all was a lie. He did oversee an arm of the organization that had just started, and grew that\u00a0outfit to several hundred people.\u00a0\nWhat has Watkins\u00a0actually said?\nOn more than one occasion on the campaign trail, Watkins has said that he started a small business and grew it from \"three people to 470 people.\"\n\"I started an engineering and security company, paramilitary company, that did work strictly for the U.S. government,\" Watkins said during one June GOP meeting. \"This was in Iraq and Afghanistan. We grew to a number of countries. We grew from three people to 470 with me as the principal during that growth period.\"\nThe business he was referring to is VIAP Inc., a spinoff of Versar Inc., a global project management firm based in Washington. Watkins didn\u2019t own the company, but he did appear to work there during a high-growth phase.\nHe never owned it\nVersar International Inc. was formed in January 1997, according to incorporation filings in Delaware. Watkins graduated from the U.S. Military Academy in West Point in 1999.\nWatkins\u2019 federal financial disclosure forms also don\u2019t list VIAP as an asset but do show him earning income from Versar, under which he is listed as a consultant.\nAccording to the forms, he received $27,819 as earned income from the company in 2018 and $45,216 in 2017.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Star spoke with several Versar company officials who did not recall or remember Watkins. One Versar CEO from 2000 to 2010, Theodore M. Provic, told the paper he\u2019s \"nobody that I\u2019ve heard of.\"\nWatkins actually joined the existing company as a contractor in 2004, according to company officials.\nBut he wasn\u2019t off on everything\nWatkins did, in fact, work for VIAP in Afghanistan and Iraq during dangerous times and helped grow his outfit from a small team to hundreds, according to Brian Arbuckle, a former military colleague of Watkins.\nArbuckle, who is is now vice president of engineering and construction management at Versar, sent a response to the Star at the request of the Watkins\u2019 campaign. PolitiFact obtained a copy, which Arbuckle stressed is not an official statement from Versar.\nHe confirmed that VIAP (which stands for Versar International Assistance Projects) was a newly developed name and business line that Versar created between 2004 and 2005, when Watkins joined the team.\n\"The name and organizational structure were new to Versar and were developed by a small team of professionals that set up and grew our business in conflict/post conflict environments,\" Arbuckle wrote. \"The initial core team included me, Steve Watkins, and three other leaders.\"\nHe said that Watkins started working for Versar in Iraq in 2004 where he and a small team started, developed and grew international operations under the name VIAP and led teams of hundreds of professionals that provided engineering and construction quality assurance services in the Middle East.\nWhat the Watkins\u2019 campaign says\nBryan Piligra, Watkins\u2019 campaign spokesman said in an email that Watkins helped form a three-man engineering and security outfit to over 470 people operating in two war zones.\n\"Steve has said countless times to media and voters throughout the district that the firm was a wholly-owned subsidiary of a publicly traded, U.S. company,\" Piligra wrote. \"He helped start it and grow it, operationally. Prior to the involvement of Steve and two other individuals, it did not exist from an operational standpoint.\"\nOur ruling\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said Watkins\u2019 lied to voters about building a company from scratch.\nWe found that Watkins did not own or build the company, VIAP, from the ground up in the Middle East, as he claimed to voters in the past.\nHe did, however, oversee and expand a small team into hundreds during his time in Iraq and Afghanistan under a new arm of Versar.\nWatkins did exaggerate his background with the company, but he did work there when it was growing. The DCCC says it was \"all a lie,\" but that\u2019s an exaggeration, too. We rate the DCCC\u2019s claim Half True. \u00a0\n Share the Facts 2018-10-11 15:25:33 UTC   PolitiFact    4 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Half True  Says that Steve Watkins \"bragged to voters that he built his company from scratch, but it was all a lie.\"    Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Party Committee https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26VDqrXjnRE    Friday, October 5, 2018 2018-10-05    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01491"}
