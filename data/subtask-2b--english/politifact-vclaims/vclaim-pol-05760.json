The probe focused on operations at the agency\u2019s Health Eligibility Center, which is described as the \"authoritative system for veterans\u2019 health enrollment and eligibility information.\" \u00a0It holds about 22.3 million records.\nThe report found that as of Sept. 30, 2014, 866,879 records were listed as \"pending,\" a status given to VA applications that are incomplete - usually because they lack financial information. Of those records, 307,173 pertained to individuals who had been reported dead by the Social Security Administration.\nSo there\u2019s a basis for Trump\u2019s number, but the figure is very complex. The report says the VA\u2019s record-keeping was so shoddy that there\u2019s no way of knowing how many of the 307,000 actually were waiting to be enrolled for VA health care when they died.\nThe agency\u2019s enrollment database was started in 1998 and includes pending files on veterans who died before that year, although the report does not say how many. The inspector general found, for example, that one veteran who died in 1988 still was listed with a pending VA application in 2014.\nAdding to the complication is that in 2013, the agency added into the entry center\u2019s database \"millions\" of records from other arms of the VA. Many of these records ended up in the pending file, according to the report, but software glitches made it impossible for investigators to determine how many of the records pertained to veterans seeking health services.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou have to remember that the VA provides many services, including home loans and disability payments. In some cases, it provides health care to family members of veterans; patients whose military service has not been confirmed; and people receiving humanitarian care.\nThe report also notes that some of the pending files pertain to people inquiring about services rather than actually applying for them. The VA \"does not have a reliable method to distinguish which enrollment records were created in response to an enrollment application or records entered into (the database) by actions other than enrollment,\" the report says.\nMaking matters worse, about 55 percent of the pending files are missing contact dates with the VA. The omissions make the database \"unreliable for monitoring timeliness or determine if a record represents a veteran\u2019s intent to apply for VA health care,\" according to the report.\nThe inspector general concluded, \"Most of the pending records are old and inactive and many of them were misclassified.\"\nOur ruling\n\"Over 300,000 veterans have died waiting for care,\" Trump said in a Norfolk speech in which he promised to overhaul the VA.\nTrump offered the most dire possible interpretation of a scathing report on VA record-keeping and went well beyond what the inspector general was able to conclude.\nThe report found that 307,173 dead people were listed last year on a VA database as having pending status with the agency. But shabby records make a detailed dissection of that number impossible. Investigators said that some of those people were not veterans; not all of them were seeking health care or necessarily any VA service; and some of them died before 1998, when the database began.\nNo doubt, the VA is ripe for criticism. But Trump\u2019s statement takes liberty with the facts, and we rate it Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05760"}
