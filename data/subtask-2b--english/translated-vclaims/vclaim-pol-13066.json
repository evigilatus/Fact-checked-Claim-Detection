We have moved on to President Barack Obama's budget proposal for fiscal year 2012, which includes a statistical table called \"the proposed budget by category.\" While this table primarily reflects the proposed budget for Obama over the next 10 years, it also covers the past two fiscal years - 2010 and 2011 - with dollar figures distributed in each category that we need to analyse the Kramer statement. Here's what we found: interest on debt: US$ 196 billion; US$ 446 billion; US$ 273 billion; US$ 701 billion; Subtotal: US$ 1.616 trillion in tax revenue: US$ 2.041 trillion, less expenditures above: US$ 425 billion; US$ 207 billion; US$ 478 billion; US$ 1.713 trillion for medical care: US$ 276 billion; and therefore US$ 742 billion very close to being corrected. But does her claim say anything meaningful about the federal budget? That's less obvious. The fact that Kramer left her unspoken is several other important elements of the federal budget. The remaining $334 billion for fiscal year 2011 should cover expenditures such as these: other mandatory programmes: $716 billion for estimated non-security expenditure: $507 billion for estimated security expenditure (mainly defence and internal security: $908 billion: total: $2.131 trillion). Now, it is certainly possible to reduce these categories -- but reaching $300 billion or $400 billion is not easy. \"Other mandatory programmes\" include programmes that are not funded annually by Congress but instead receive funds according to a predetermined formula. These benefits include federal civil and military retirement benefits, food stamps, unemployment benefits and veterans &apos; benefits. It is possible to reformulate these programmes in a way that is severely curtailed or even eliminated, but which is a major challenge, both legislative and political. The second category, estimated non-security expenditure, is easier to reduce in practice, but even within this category there are many expenditures that, although estimated, are not easy to give up, from food and drug safety to air traffic control. Finally, Kramer's comparison does not allocate one cent to the army or to internal security. Even reducing the current amount by half - a path that is almost entirely impractical in the short term - will exceed the 2011 increase for Kramer by more than one third. \"Long before the existence of medical care, medical care or social security, she had an army and a Navy,\" said Gary Portless, economist with an institution from centre to liberal Brookings. \"I believe that the omission of \"national defence\" from Ms. Kramer's list of necessities is a very important clarification.\" The evaluation of the Kramer statement is a challenge, because what she has said is undeniablely true, but limited, with missing factors that diminish the relevance of her statement. When we asked a diverse ideological group of economists how useful they were for the Kramer formula, their answers ranged widely. For example, J.D. Foster, an economist at the Conservative Heritage Foundation, noted that some of the extra costs left out of the equation by Kramer could be captured by curbing the factors I included. He said, \"If we're gonna play \"what if,\" then you have to let her have wanted to cut off some medical care, medical aid, and social security to make room for other expenses that are not on the list.\" Kramer is to be commended for doing the math properly. However, its decision to ignore spending on defence and internal security -- not to mention mandatory programs such as veterans' benefits and estimated safety-related expenditure -- makes the comparison of questionable value to discuss the country's budgetary problems. We evaluate her statement half right. On January 13, 2021, the distinguished fact-finding bloggers announced in a story in which General David H. Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for the use of marines for inaugural security, saying, \"We are not working for you.\"", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13066"}
