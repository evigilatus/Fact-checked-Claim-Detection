During the Republican campaign in New Hampshire on October 16, Paul told Radio Concord News that President Barack Obama \"tryed to reduce the possibility of transmission\" of the Ebola virus to such an extent that it put people at risk. \"This is an incredibly contagious disease,\" said Paul. \"People in gloves and clothes are full of it. So they have to be honest -- this is a very transient disease.\" Paul added: \"They are still learning about this subject. We all continue to learn about this subject. But that's not something that's hard to catch, that's something that seems very easy to catch.\" Is the Ebola virus \"incredibly contagious,\" \"very transmitted\" and \"easy to catch\"? We decided to check it out. Paul's office said that his comments indicated that he was talking about how easy it was to get the virus from contacting an infected individual. In a long response to Polyte Vac, Brian Darling's spokesman said that \"the exposure to even a small amount of the virus can cause infection.\" According to WHO, the Ebola outbreak in 2014 in West Africa is the largest in history. It is also the first time that the virus has reached the United States; health officials confirmed the fourth case in the United States on Thursday at a doctor returning to New York from Ebola treatment in West Africa. But so far, only two people have infected the virus on U.S. soil, both health-care workers in Texas who treated an African man who later died of the disease. This is despite the fact that the infected persons were hit by dozens, if not hundreds, of people while they were infected, including close family members. This seems to dispel, at least in a storyal way, the idea that the disease is \"incredibly contagious\" and \"easy to catch,\" even from an injured person. But let's get into the stench. How does Ebola spread? Ebola is not an airborne infection. For example, it is rare - if at all possible - for the disease to spread through cough or sneeze (which is not even Ebola's symptoms, as our colleagues at Bondet Fuckett recently observed). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Ebola is spread through \"human transmission to humans through direct contact (by breaking skin or mucous membrane) with blood, excretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected persons.\" This means that the most common method of Ebola proliferation is direct contact with vomiting, blood or feces of an infected patient. Individuals with such contact are at great risk. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say: \"Be about 3 feet from a patient (Ebola), inside the patient's room or care area for a long period of time,\" is also a potential cause for concern. However, the organization indicated that the risks were low. There is also a potential risk of transmission through contaminated surfaces and objects, but WHO notes that again the risk is low, and most studies from past Ebola outbreaks show that \"all cases were directly related to patients with symptoms. Finally, experts note that individuals are not contagious in the sense that they cannot spread the virus until they have symptoms ranging from two to 21 days. Symptoms begin with fever, followed by vomiting and diarrhea. In order to be at great risk of Ebola, you have to touch blood, feces or vomiting on someone with symptoms. The number of people who find themselves in this situation is relatively small. There is potential to spread other ways - such as to be in a close range with an infected person or to touch a contaminated body by an infected person - but the risk is low, because \"as a wrapped virus, it has a low tendency to survive outside the body,\" said Thomas Vickett, a professor of infectious diseases at Temple University Medical School. 'Cause it's not for nothing. It's not easy to catch through the respiratory system.' How contagious is it? The Centre for the Control of Infectious Diseases is defined as \"a very contagious disease capable of spreading rapidly from one person to another through contact or proximity.\" On January 31, 2021, Ryan Fornier stated on Twitter that \"Biden's administration has lost 20 million COVID vaccines.\" Noah Y. Kim wrote: February 1, 2021 in Africa, that the disease caused many victims because of poor health systems that lack supplies and guarantees and because of burial practices where people deal directly with bodies that are not protected. That's what caused such a great spread there. Burialism is a particular problem because, as Christopher Wallen, a professor of infectious epidemiology at the School of Public Health at the University of Georgia, has very high levels of the virus and is \"very contagious as a result.\" However, even in the worst outbreaks in Africa, health-care officials observed that the disease did not spread from host to many other countries. The basic reproductive figure of the disease, or R0, is calculated as the average number of secondary cases resulting from the injury of a person entering the non-infected population. The higher the R0 rise above 1, the greater the chances of its spread. The rate of Ebola infection in Africa during its recent outbreak ranged from 1.20 to 2.02, by country. This is consistent with historical data on the disease. How does that compare with other viruses? Well, HIV, which is only transmitted by sexual intercourse and blood transfusion, has R0 of 4. Measles have R0 of 18 In other words, while the disease has the potential to spread, \"the minimum requirements for Ebola containment are far less serious than containing more infectious diseases, such as measles,\" according to the WHO Ebola Response Team. Rachel Jones, a professor at the University of Illinois-Chicago School of Public Health, said: \"Epidemic evidence suggests that Ebola is less infected than many other viruses that usually affect people, such as influenza. What if you're in contact with someone with Ebola? Ebola is \"easy to catch\" in the sense that you don't need long contact with the infected fluids to pick it up, Vickett said. However, many people do not touch these infected fluids. The evidence shows that some people who spend time with an infected patient also do not have access to the virus. \"It seems as if even short exposure to the virus can lead to a transmission event, as some patients describe a single communication event with a patient,\" said Wallen. However, on the other hand, they considered all the family members of Ebola patients who had been injured in one case &apos; s home, but who had not been infected. We tend not to hear about them, yet they are an important part of our understanding of the rate of attack.\" But Paul's spokesman, Darling, said: \"The reason that doctors and nurses who touch an injured person must put 100% protection and then undergo a thorough disinfection, is that it's \"easy to catch\" from someone who shows symptoms. This is not necessarily what the health experts we talked to said. On the one hand, health-care workers are in close contact with infected individuals in their most contagious cases, dealing with bodily fluids known to carry higher concentrations of the virus. This puts them at greater risk than a person sitting next to an injured person, even if that person is suffering from symptoms. Moreover, unlike much more infectious diseases, Ebola causes 50 per cent of patients to die. This lights up extra precautions. \"These recommendations arise from the risk of infection, not from the infection causing the disease,\" Johns said. Given the high mortality rate, if it is \"incredibly contagious\" and \"easy to catch,\" the United States is likely to have more deaths already. \"The joke that the Americans married Kim Kardashian more than they died from Ebola wouldn't be true if it was easy to pick it up,\" said Vickett. Our rule is Paul called Ebola \"incredibly contagious,\" \"very mobile\" and \"easy to catch.\" A person who touches physical fluid from an Ebola patient for a short time can be infected with the virus. In this limited sense, Ebola is \"easy to arrest.\" Health-care workers and individuals who deal with patients who are dying or close to them are also at greater risk, as this appears to be the case when the disease is most contagious. However, overwhelming evidence shows that Ebola is less contagious and can be transmitted from many other diseases. According to the figures, Ebola patients continue to be infected by relatively few people. The reason for this is that the patient only spreads the disease as he shows symptoms; the virus cannot spread in the air; people often do not touch the physical fluids of other people. Infecting the disease in other ways, such as touching rooftops or standing near infected patients, is rare, albeit possible, and poses a low risk. Ebola is a dangerous and deadly disease that is fully capable of spreading if the necessary precautions are not taken. But using words like \"unbelievable,\" \"very easy\" and \"easy,\" Paul is magnifying the ability of the virus to transmit from one person to another. We're mostly assessing his statement wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07076"}
