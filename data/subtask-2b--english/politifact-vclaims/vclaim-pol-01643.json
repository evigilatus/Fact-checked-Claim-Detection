Republicans and Democrats either want credit for any progress being made, or want to blame the other side for any lack of progress.\nSen. Michael Lee, a Republican from Wilmington, is gearing up for re-election against Harper Peterson, a former Wilmington mayor.\u00a0He tweeted\u00a0on Aug. 28 that \"teacher pay has increased under Republican leadership every year for the past 5 years. In fact, even according to the national teacher\u2019s unions own rankings, NC ranked number 2 in the U.S. for fastest rising teacher pay 2016-2017.\"\nDid teacher pay increase over the past five years?\nHere\u2019s the average teacher salary from the past five years:\n2013-14: $44,990\n2014-15: $47,819\n2015-16: $47,985\n2016-17: $49,837\n2017-18: $50,861\nThose teacher salaries also include supplements, but those are provided by the local district and not the General Assembly.\nThe numbers do not take into consideration any rise in health care premiums, cost-of-living or other expenses. The average rate of inflation over the course of these years was 2.3 percent, based on information from\u00a0the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nAt first glance, it does appear that teachers got a pay raise every year. However, the\u00a0salary schedules\u00a0from the North Carolina Department of Instruction tell a slightly different story.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeachers with 35 years of experience were being paid $52,150 in the\u00a02013-14 school year.\u00a0In the\u00a02014-15 school year, the base salary for teachers with 25 years of experience or more dropped to $50,000. The 2016\u00a0\"Held Harmless\" statute\u00a0made sure no teacher would make less in 2016-17 than in 2014-15. So, those teachers did not receive a pay cut in the following years.\nThe average pay did increase every year after the 2013-14 school year. In the\u00a02017-18 academic year, teachers with 35 years of experience were paid $51,300. Basically, teachers who reach 35 years of experience today because they are now included in the overall \"25-year-plus\" category.\n(Clarification: An earlier version of this story said teachers received pay cuts following the 2013-14 academic year. However, we neglected to factor in the \"Held Harmless\" statute that prevents teacher pay cuts.)\nIt\u2019s the same story for teachers with 36 years of experience. They were paid $53,180 in the\u00a02013-14 academic year, but teachers who reach 36 years of experience would\u2019ve been paid $50,000 in the 2014-15 academic year. In the\u00a02017-18 academic year, these teachers were paid $51,300 as well.\nThe same\u00a0\"Held Harmless\" statute\u00a0has been included in the 2018-19 budgets so no teacher gets a pay cut.\nIn addition, teachers with up to four years were the only ones to get a base salary increase in the\u00a02015-16 academic year. They were paid $33,000 in 2014-15, and then paid $35,000 in 2015-16.\nIn the following years, first-year teachers did not see an increase to their base salary. It stayed at $35,000.\nHow fast did teacher pay increase?\nNorth Carolina was\u00a0ranked second\u00a0in having the fastest teacher pay raise in 2016-17 nationally, according to the\u00a0National Education Association. This is where Lee\u2019s legislative assistant, Emily Barnes, says Lee got his information.\nHowever, that hasn\u2019t always been the case. In the\u00a02013-14\u00a0academic year, North Carolina was ranked 48th for percentage change in average teacher salary, with a -1.6 percent change. The state also ranked 41st in the\u00a02015-16\u00a0academic year for teacher pay raises with a 0.3 percent change.\nNorth Carolina did rank first in teacher\u00a0pay raise in 2014-15\u00a0with a 6.3 percent change from the previous year.\nOur ruling\nTeachers did get a salary increase in each of the past five years under Republican leadership. However, despite the \"Held Harmless\" statute, teachers who reach 25 years of experience or more today would not make as much as they would have in 2013-14. That\u2019s the main wrinkle in Lee\u2019s claim. North Carolina ranked second in fastest-rising teacher pay in 2016-17, though the ranking wasn\u2019t consistent over the years. We rate this claim Mostly True.\nThis story was produced by the North Carolina Fact-Checking Project, a partnership of McClatchy Carolinas, the Duke University Reporters\u2019 Lab and PolitiFact.
