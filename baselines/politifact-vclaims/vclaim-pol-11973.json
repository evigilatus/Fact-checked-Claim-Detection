Scott Walker says recall organizers began effort even before he took office", "text": "CNBC\u2019s Becky Quick put a question to Gov. Scott Walker after recall organizers claimed that after just 12 days they had more than half the signatures needed to force an election.\n\nHow are you feeling about this?\n\nWalker conceded the drive probably would succeed, putting a recall election on the ballot in 2012. But he downplayed the significance, saying if the effort got the required 540,000 valid signatures it would equal just 25 percent of the voters in the 2010 governor\u2019s race he won.\n\n\"A minority of voters will get to force a new election in Wisconsin,\" he said in the Nov. 30, 2011 appearance.\n\nWalker also argued against the idea it was a fast start by opponents, saying that while the drive officially kicked off in mid-November, those behind the recall actually got going well before he even took office in January 2011.\n\n\"The recall organizers -- who by the way started their website last November, they didn\u2019t just start organically earlier this year \u2013 they\u2019ve been planning this for some time.\"\n\nHe made a similar to a claim National Public Radio two weeks earlier.\n\nTo be sure, Walker inspired anger and protests even before assuming office, based on his rejection of high-speed rail funds, talk of a showdown with state employee unions, and other issues.\n\nBut was a recall effort already under way?\n\nWhen asked to support the claim, Walker\u2019s office referred us to the state Republican Party, which is helping with his campaign. They told us Walker was referring to recallscottwalker.com, a website that -- as its name suggests -- advocates for Walker\u2019s ouster.\n\nThe domain name was registered more than a year ago, in November 2010, according to the registration record and a post on the site by its manager, Ben Paulson, a Milwaukee-area resident.\n\nState GOP spokesman Ben Sparks said the party views Paulson as one of several liberal activists who got the recall push rolling in the fall of 2010.\n\n\"The recall began because the Democrats are sore losers,\" Sparks said.\n\nThe state Democratic Party is behind the recall drive, in concert with the group United Wisconsin and labor organizations.\n\nBased on publicly available information, United Wisconsin began operating in late February, signing up supporters and getting 200,000 unofficial \"pledges\" to recall Walker. That was shortly after Walker unveiled the union limits that drew massive protests at the Capitol and sent Senate Democrats fleeing to Illinois to block a quorum for weeks.\n\nBut Walker\u2019s statement puts Paulson at the center of the effort -- and gives it a three-month earlier start.\n\nPaulson is a virtual unknown among major players on both sides, both personally and politically, based on our interviews with both parties, recall activists and union officials involved in the effort.\n\nIn fact, Paulson and his site have attracted little attention, even in the liberal blogosphere. We couldn\u2019t find a single interview with Paulson and only a few scattered Internet references to his website.\n\nAt least initially, Paulson\u2019s site was viewed suspiciously by some liberals as a possible GOP front aimed at locking up a good domain name. A story on the Wisconsin Reporter, a conservative online site, described recallscottwalker.com as \"the purported creation of Ben Paulson.\"\n\nAs for Paulson himself, even the Republicans know nothing about him and say he\u2019s \"elusive.\"\n\n\"We have not been able to connect him in any official way\" to the recall organizers, said Sparks of the state party.\n\nSo, that undermines the group\u2019s main point -- and the statement from Walker himself.\n\nOn his website, Paulson describes himself as a moderate Democrat \"who believes in fiscal and social responsibility.\"\n\n\"As many of you, I have been horrified with what has been transpiring in this state since January 3, 2011,\" Paulson wrote in an undated introductory post. \"Let\u2019s see where this takes us and maybe ... just maybe ... we can change people\u2019s minds and get a change in the governor\u2019s mansion before too much damage is done in Wisconsin.\"\n\nNotably, Paulson did not post on the site until Feb. 19, 2011 -- eight days after Walker announced his curbs on unions.\n\nThat post was a link to the recall statute. In fact, the site functions mainly as a repository of news and commentary on the recall.\n\nThat\u2019s a sharp contrast to the United Wisconsin and Democratic Party recall machine, which run interactive websites and detailed county-by-county organizing efforts.\n\nAs for the recall effort itself, United Wisconsin launched its \"pledge\" drive on Feb. 18, 2011, and registered a political action committee March 1. It joined forces on the petition drive in the fall of 2011 with the Democratic Party, prompting skepticism on the right about its independence.\n\nPaulson\u2019s website does link to the United Wisconsin and Democratic Party of Wisconsin sites.\n\nBut so do many other blogs and websites on the left.\n\nWe reached Paulson, and he scoffed at the notion he somehow spawned the current recall drive.\n\n\"I was talking and joking with a co-worker about how Gov. Walker would end up being recalled just as he had won election as the Milwaukee County Executive via recall,\" he wrote in an email. \"I checked, the domain was free, and I registered it, not to think about it again until everything erupted in February.\"\n\nHe added: \"I am not an organizer of the recall nor have I initiated any recall activities. The current recall does not trace back to me in any way.\"\n\nPaulson, who works as an engineer with a manufacturing company, said he has had no contact with the United Wisconsin recall group or the Democratic Party.\n\nIndeed, United Wisconsin officials said he was not among the 200,000 people who signed the \"pledges\" to recall Walker.\n\nOur conclusion\n\nIn a CNBC interview, Walker traced the current recall drive and organization to November 2010, arguing that recall leaders were gearing up even before he took office.\n\nBut the founder of the website is not a recall organizer; he\u2019s a fringe player at best who took no steps to actually organize the petition drive. Even Republican officials can cite no evidence to the contrary.\n\nWhile his recall-advocacy website was registered back then, the site was dormant until Walker\u2019s controversial bill was introduced. The real \"recall organizers\u2019\" website, that of United Wisconsin, kicked into operation only after Walker proposed his controversial budget bill in February 2011.\n\nWe rate Walker\u2019s statement False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11973"}
