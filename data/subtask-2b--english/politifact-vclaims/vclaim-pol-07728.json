Jeanne Shaheen\u2019s views on energy policy.\nBrown warned that Shaheen, a Democrat who faces re-election in the fall, is pushing for a \"national energy tax.\"\nThe claim was repeated on Brown\u2019s website and in a series of press releases from his campaign, and was reiterated in an op-ed published during his \"making energy affordable\" tour.\nBrown said he supports a variety of measures to make energy more affordable without passing \"Sen. Shaheen\u2019s national energy tax.\"\nWith the New Hampshire Senate race drawing national attention, it wasn\u2019t long before Brown\u2019s comments were scrutinized.\nJudy Reardon, Shaheen\u2019s chief counsel, issued a challenge to Brown\u2019s campaign on Twitter, asking the former Massachusetts senator to provide evidence that Shaheen supports a \"national energy tax.\"\n\"Please cite the vote,\" she wrote in a June 9 message.\nBrown\u2019s campaign manager, Colin Reed, shot back in a press release that he found it troubling Shaheen\u2019s staff didn\u2019t remember Shaheen\u2019s votes in Congress.\n\"The simple fact is that one year ago, Sen. Shaheen voted for a measure that would have amounted to a new national energy tax which would have a disastrous impact on New Hampshire\u2019s economy,\" Reed said.\nWith Brown and Shaheen sparring on energy policy, we decided to delve deeper into the issue. We were curious about whether Shaheen\u2019s record indeed showed support for an energy tax or carbon tax, as taxes on oil, gas and coal usage are sometimes called.\nThe logic behind the tax is that by making natural resources costlier for individuals and businesses to use, a carbon tax would encourage the use of alternative energy sources.\nMost economists agree that a carbon tax would be effective, but the issue hasn\u2019t gained much political traction.\nWe began by asking Brown\u2019s campaign to explain his statements. Brown campaign staffer Elizabeth Guyton pointed us to Shaheen\u2019s vote on a 2013 budget resolution put forth by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., who has expressed support for implementing a carbon tax.\nThe resolution stipulated that revenue generated by any future carbon tax must be given back to the public in some form.\nShaheen voted in favor of the budget resolution, though nothing in that amendment would actually enact a carbon tax. Rather, the amendment offered a rough framework for how money generated from such a tax, if one were enacted, would be put to use.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden canceled the Keystone pipeline because Warren Buffett \u201cdonated $58 million\u201d to his campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think that ultimately a fee on carbon pollution is inevitable, and the purpose of that amendment was to begin a discussion on that and begin the discussion about when that happens, what the best way to use the proceeds of the fee are,\" Whitehouse told reporters in September. \"So from that point of view, I didn\u2019t view it as binding anybody on a carbon fee, but I did view it as an assessment of the best way of using carbon fee proceeds.\"\nAlthough she was allying herself with a carbon tax supporter\u2019s amendment, Shaheen\u2019s vote wasn\u2019t directly in support of a carbon tax.\nThe second piece of evidence offered by Brown\u2019s campaign concerns an amendment proposed by Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo. Blunt has emerged as a persistent carbon tax opponent in the Senate.\nIn 2013, Blunt proposed an amendment that would have increased the threshold for passing a carbon tax framework within the budget resolution to 60 votes.\nShaheen voted against this amendment, even as some of her Democratic colleagues from energy producing states voted for it. Still, by voting against Blunt\u2019s measure, Shaheen wasn\u2019t directly expressing support for a carbon tax.\nShripal Shah, a spokesman from Shaheen\u2019s Senate office, said that Shaheen has never supported a carbon tax. In an email, Shah wrote that Shaheen supports \"market-driven solutions\" to address pollution, such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.\nThis statement seems to fall in line with the position Shaheen took when she first campaigned for the Senate in 2008. During a roundtable discussion at Seacoast Energy Alternatives in Somersworth, New Hampshire, Shaheen said she would prefer a cap-and-trade program over a carbon tax because it\u2019s \"easier to sell to the population\" and \"puts the onus\" on the polluters.\nWhen it comes to the legislative record, Shaheen\u2019s efforts to influence energy policy since taking office have been focused largely on boosting energy efficiency.\nShaheen partnered with Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, to craft an energy efficiency bill that would launch a federal training program for energy-efficient building design and operation and establish a loan program for energy improvements to homes and small businesses, among other initiatives.\nThe bill has twice died in the Senate. The most recent effort failed on May 12, 2014, when supporters failed to reach the 60 votes necessary to close debate on the bill and proceed to a final vote.\nShaheen took to the Senate floor after it became clear the measure would not pass to remind her colleagues that energy efficiency is the cheapest, fastest and cleanest way to address the country's energy demand.\n\"One of the things that I like about energy efficiency is that it doesn\u2019t matter whether you support fossil fuels or whether you support alternative sources of energy,\" she said. \"Everyone benefits from energy efficiency.\"\nOur ruling\nBrown\u2019s campaign said that Shaheen voted for a measure that would have amounted to a new national energy tax.\nThe campaign cited Shaheen\u2019s support for a 2013 amendment that would have established guidelines for any future carbon tax. They also pointed to Shaheen\u2019s vote against legislation that would have made it harder to pass a carbon tax framework.\nShaheen\u2019s campaign told us Shaheen has never supported a carbon tax, and we didn\u2019t find any evidence to contradict that. One of her major legislative efforts, the Shaheen-Portman bill, focused on energy efficiency.\nBrown has a point that Shaheen voted for a revenue plan offered by a carbon tax supporter and shrugged off a proposal from a carbon tax opponent. Still, neither of those positions is the same as voting for a new energy tax.\nWe rate this claim Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07728"}
