If POTUS knew about fraud 2 1/2 yrs ago & there was a big sting OP going down, a LOT of DC, state capitals and pols are going down VERY HARD!\" reads a Nov. 30 Tweet.\nCIA spokesperson Nicole de Haay called the allegation the \"most absurd inquiry\" she had ever addressed.\u00a0\n\"I\u2019m happy to tell you that Director Haspel is alive and well and at the office,\" she wrote in a Dec. 2 email.\u00a0\nLinks to another conspiracy theory\nThe claim appears to stem from a baseless conspiracy theory that alleges the U.S. military raided the Spanish election software company Scytl in Frankfurt, Germany, and seized its servers for evidence of manipulation in the 2020 U.S. elections. Some posts claim that Scytl has links to Dominion Voting Software, the election software and hardware manufacturer that has become a frequent target of misinformation.\u00a0\nThe raid never actually took place.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth Scytl and the U.S. Army, which has been identified in some posts as having conducted the raid, told the Associated Press that it never happened. And Scytl doesn\u2019t have any servers or offices in Frankfurt.\u00a0\u00a0\nNevertheless, some social media users spread false rumors that Haspel had been involved in the raid, claiming that the Army had arrested her and sent her to Guantanamo Bay, the U.S. military prison.\u00a0\n\u00a0It\u2019s unclear how these rumors began, but one of the earliest mentions we found is in an article dated Nov. 29 published by a conspiracy-oriented website called \"Rumor Mill News.\" The article misspells Haspel\u2019s name several times.\u00a0\u00a0\nShortly after the claim began to circulate, social media users began to also speculate Haspel had actually been killed in the raid, citing an anonymous \"DC Insider.\"\nNone of the users who helped push the story have cited any credible sources or provided a shred of proof to back up their assertions.\nThe claims about Haspel are inaccurate and ridiculous.
