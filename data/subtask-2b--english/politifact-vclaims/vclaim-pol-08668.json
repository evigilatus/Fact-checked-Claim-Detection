Some will like the Massachusetts approach, and some won\u2019t, he said.\nThe Massachusetts approach \"teaches some important lessons some states are not going to want to follow,\" Romney said. \"One lesson is health insurance is more expensive in Massachusetts than anywhere else in the country. Now, that\u2019s something that Texas and Minnesota and Montana are not going to necessarily want to adopt.\"\nIs it true that health insurance is \"more expensive in Massachusetts than anywhere else in the country\"?\nThere are a number of ways to measure the cost of what Romney termed \"health insurance.\" For answers, we turned to research by the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. Here are a few of the categories that would seem to fit Romney\u2019s definition. (Note: None of the categories here include the District of Columbia.)\nEmployer-based health insurance for individuals\n\u2022 Employee share: Massachusetts ranks 1st among all states.\n\u2022 Employer share: Massachusetts ranks 10th among all states.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 Combined employee and employer share: Massachusetts ranks 2nd among all states. (Only Alaska is higher.)\nEmployer-based health insurance for families\n\u2022 Employee share: Massachusetts ranks 11th among all states.\n\u2022 Employer share: Massachusetts ranks 5th among all states.\n\u2022 Combined employee and employer share: Massachusetts ranks 2nd among all states. (Only Alaska is higher.)\nIndividual-market insurance per person\n\u2022 Monthly premiums: Massachusetts ranks first.\nSo, overall, health insurance costs are indeed higher in Massachusetts than almost anywhere else.\nStill, it\u2019s worth noting that while Massachusetts\u2019 universal health care plan is likely a factor in producing high costs, it\u2019s probably not the only factor.\nThe state ranked second nationally in per capita personal income in 2012 (Connecticut was first), and it ranked eighth in the nation in highest cost of living. Whenever residents of a state make a lot of income and pay a lot for consumer goods generally, it\u2019s likely to follow that health care will be relatively expensive as well.\nIn addition, Massachusetts ranks first among states in health care expenditures per capita, and most of the rest of the top 10 consists of other relatively affluent, northeastern and mid-Atlantic states: Connecticut, Maine, Delaware, New York, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, and Pennsylvania. (The others are Alaska and North Dakota.)\nOur ruling\nRomney said, \"health insurance is more expensive in Massachusetts than anywhere else in the country.\" The numbers show he\u2019s basically correct that Massachusetts does have higher premiums than almost every other state. On some measures, though, Alaska outranks Massachusetts.\u00a0The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08668"}
