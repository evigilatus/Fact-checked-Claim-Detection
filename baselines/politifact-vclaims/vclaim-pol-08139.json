He does tend to paint his cause in broad strokes, however.\nDuring a University of Tampa debate on medicinal use of the drug on Feb. 24, Morgan argued that it\u2019s misguided to enforce marijuana laws, using the example of Cathy Jordan, a 64-year-old Parrish resident who smokes to combat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease.\n\"The issue for this year is very simple,\" Morgan said. \"Should about 350,000 to 400,000 people, including Cathy Jordan, who\u2019s here tonight, who was arrested last year, drug out of her home, because she suffers from ALS, and marijuana is the only thing that will help her, the only question this year for us is the legalization of medical marijuana.\"\nLater, he added this: \"There was an arrest of Cathy Jordan a year ago. An ALS patient who\u2019s sitting right here ... this afternoon, and guess what? The agricultural commissioner sent a SWAT team of hooligans out to her house to drag her and her husband out because it's the only relief that she could get.\"\nJordan is now the president of the Florida Cannabis Action Network, while Morgan has spent $4 million of his own money on a petition drive for a constitutional amendment for marijuana.\nSome of the details Morgan mentioned about Jordan\u2019s encounter with law enforcement, though, didn\u2019t sound right, so we decided to check it out.\nActing on a tip\nThe Tampa Bay Times wrote about Jordan\u2019s plight last year, confirming that her marijuana usage did in fact attract the attention of Manatee County sheriff\u2019s deputies on Feb. 25, 2013. A Realtor noticed an extension cord running from a shed on Jordan\u2019s property to an empty home\u2019s garage next door, then saw a mature marijuana plant growing in Jordan\u2019s garden. The Realtor called the authorities.\nAccording to an incident report, two deputies responded to the call, originally for burglary and theft of service for the extension cord, and confirmed the plant was there.\nThe responding deputies\u2019 reports noted that two men harassed them and recorded their arrival and subsequent investigation. One of the men (neither are named in those reports, although Robert Jordan and his son were home) reportedly bumped one of the deputies several times and attempted to prevent the pair of officers from entering their property, saying the marijuana was theirs and they wanted the deputies to leave.\nOne deputy called his sergeant, who responded and then requested the department\u2019s Special Investigations Division, an undercover vice and narcotics unit that responds to drug calls. Three detectives responded to the call and spoke to Robert Jordan, who let the police enter his house and explained his wife used marijuana to deal with her ALS symptoms, according to the division\u2019s report.\nPolice confirmed no marijuana being grown inside the house, then went outside to find three large plants in a plastic container and two smaller plants in another. Robert Jordan then opened the shed that used the extension cord to reveal 18 smaller seedlings, \"a lighting system, an air conditioner, a thermometer and a white erase board to track planting dates.\"\nThe authorities explained to Robert Jordan that growing marijuana was illegal under federal law and they could either take all the marijuana \"observed in plain view\" or they would go get a warrant and forcibly remove the plants. The report states neither he nor his wife were ever threatened with arrest, but reluctantly agreed to let the department confiscate 23 plants.\nNo one was arrested or dragged out of their house by a SWAT team.\nThe Jordans sued the Sheriff\u2019s Office for the return of their plants last year. Sheriff\u2019s Office public information officer Dave Bristow did verify that none of the officers responding drew their guns and only entered the Jordans\u2019 property with permission. No warrants were necessary. The Manatee County Sheriff\u2019s Office wouldn\u2019t comment on the incident other than to confirm details in the report, citing pending civil litigation.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRobert Jordan confirmed the incident happened the way the sheriff\u2019s reports says it did, although he said the deputies who first arrived did rush up his driveway with their hands on their sidearms. He described them as \"very, very aggressive,\" although he said he was aggressive, too, arguing about whether probable cause allowed them on his property. He noted he told his wife to go across the street with friends after the deputies arrived, and no one touched her.\nHe had a different opinion about the Special Investigations Division detectives.\n\"The actual narcotics officers, they were gentlemen,\" Jordan said. \"They were embarrassed, because I told them they were taking my wife\u2019s medicine.\"\nTwo of the trio wore ski masks, Jordan said, which the Sheriff\u2019s Office said is procedure to conceal their identities for undercover work. The unmasked detective told Jordan he had two choices: They could wait outside a couple of hours while they got a warrant. Jordan said the detective told him they would then come back and \"tear your house apart. And we don\u2019t put nothing back.\" Or the Jordans could walk them through the house and allow the unit to confiscate his plants, then wait for word on official charges.\nThe officer then told Jordan they had a right to take anything in the shed, but opted to only remove the light bulb from the grow lamp and smash it.\nThe same week, State Sen. Jeff Clemens, D-Lake Worth, introduced a medical marijuana bill called the Cathy Jordan Medical Cannabis Act. The bill died, but he filed another bill under the same name in February, ostensibly to set a framework should the amendment pass in November.\nRobert Jordan was in the process of buying the property next door, and the utilities were in his name, so the burglary and theft of service charges were never brought, and the Realtor\u2019s company declined to press any trespassing charges.\nThe Manatee County state attorney\u2019s later reviewed the case and declined to press growing and possession charges because \"the state lacks a good-faith belief it can overcome a medical necessity defense in this matter,\" according to the office\u2019s report. Robert Jordan could have faced a felony count of possession and manufacturing of a Schedule I drug.\nWe asked the United for Care campaign for a response. Manager Ben Pollara said Morgan\u2019s comments were off the cuff.\n\"I think it\u2019s just a case of something that happened a year ago \u2026 and he was talking from memory,\" Pollara said. A story about officers in ski masks with guns probably made it sound like a SWAT team, he said.\nRobert Jordan said he figured Morgan may have gotten his account from any of the numerous outlets that layered on the hyperbole about machine guns and police brutality -- he named this story by the Huffington Post as being particularly loose with the facts. \"No one asked me, or I would have told them the truth,\" Jordan said.\nHe also said he had only met John Morgan and didn\u2019t know him, but liked the man for his devotion to getting medical marijuana legislation passed, and how Morgan treated his wife. Having a legal supply of cannabis available would certainly make his life easier, he added.\nMeanwhile, the Jordans continue to cultivate their own plants, thanks to having the charges dropped.\nThe ruling\nMorgan said \"a SWAT team of hooligans\" dragged Cathy Jordan out of her home and arrested her after authorities discovered her family\u2019s tiny growing operation in their Parrish backyard.\nOfficers obtained consent to search the property and removed mature plants and seedlings, and Robert Jordan faced charges of growing and possessing marijuana, which were later dropped. No one was arrested. No one was dragged anywhere. It seems Morgan may have read a report of the incident awash in hyperbole and recalled that.\nThere was an incident at the Jordans\u2019 home, but the police reaction was not nearly as drastic as Morgan described.
