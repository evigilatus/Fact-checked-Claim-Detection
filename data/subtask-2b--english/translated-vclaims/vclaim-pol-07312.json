The Republicans in the House of Representatives, who support Fagan's competitor, Judy Bailey, sent us a statement from the entry of the Fagan voter handbook. They argue that the statement misrepresents Fagan &apos; s participation in a bill submitted to the 2013 ordinary session of the Legislature. Claim: The statement relates to the House of Representatives Bill No. 3473, which would have amended part of the State General Contract Act to require public agencies to purchase iron or steel of American manufacture if the purchase value exceeded $50,000. \"I sponsored the new Oregon Act to buy Americans and fought to give local companies the first chance in state contracts, so the tax money they earned is hard to create more jobs here at home.\" \"HB 3473 of the 2013 session did not become law,\" wrote Kara Walker, speaking on behalf of the Republicans. \"Fagan's assurance that she has sponsored a false and misleading new law.\" Polyte Fact Oregon has decided to check. Analysis: Called the Fagan campaign. Fagan, a trade lawyer by profession, defended her choice of words in e-mail. \"Yeah, the terms \"Bill\" and \"Law\" are often used in joint speech,\" wrote, \"Specially by every day of Oregon, who are the audience for voter statements.\" Rapid Google research had shown two cases that supported its assertion. One of them is linked to a report by the South Oregon TV station entitled \"Now it's the role of the Oregon Senate to vote on weapons laws.\" The second took us to a press release issued last spring by the Oregon Republican Party. Fagan said: \"The terms \"Bill\" and \"Law\" have been used interchangeably.\" We have reviewed the state &apos; s legislative position and found Fagan among the ten sponsors - six Democrats and four Republicans - of HB 3473. The bill was a first reading in the House of Representatives on 28 March 2013. One public hearing was held on 10 April 2013. The draft law was still pending in the Business and Labour Committee of the Chamber of Deputies when the session ended on 8 July 2013. So, can she really call it a law? He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. \u2022 On January 12, 2012, we contacted Legislative Adviser Dexter Johnson, whose office reviews the proposals of legislators for new laws and drafts them for submission to the plenary Assembly. We walked through the process of drafting the bill and then summarized: \"This is technically a draft law. \"It didn't become law.\" We called Vera Katz, a long-time democratic legislator in Oregon, who worked as a speaker in the House of Representatives and later as Mayor of Portland. We didn't recognize Fagan by name, but we asked if Bill and Law were routinely used in Salem. She said, \"That's not accurate.\" \"It's a bill. It's not a law. This person should have been more careful.\" We moved on to the links that Fagan provided. The headline of KPIC (Rosburg) referred to \"arms laws,\" but every reference in the story was to \"cards.\" A press release issued by the Democratic Party on 4 April 2013 stated why the Party was opposed to four proposed draft laws on democratic weapons. \"These laws,\" said the release, \"the guilt of all the owners of firearms...\" this language, however, seems conditional, collects any legislation against weapons under one umbrella, and said, in essence, \"laws such as these are not required.\" Finally, we addressed the part of Fagan's claim where she said that the words \"Bill\" and \"Law\" were often used interchangeably in the joint discourse, especially by the Oregon...........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  Without counting the three people who waved, everyone immediately replied that the terms were separate and distinct. Decision: Fagan, in her first re-election to House 51, wrote in her voter handbook that she \"sponsored the new U.S. law of Oregon.\" HB 3473, Proposal to amend the Oregon Public Contracts Act, died on the Committee after one public hearing. Neither room has passed and the Government has never signed it into law. (John Kitzhaber) The Bureau drafting the legislative proposals says that words cannot be used interchangeably, while a politician from Oregon a long time ago said that Vagan should have \"be more careful\" in her statement. The links that Fagan made to defend her statement were not convincing, and a quick and unscientific survey of \"people every day\" failed to support her claim. In the event of her re-election, Fagan said that she intended to reintroduce the bill at the 2015 session. There is still an opportunity for its draft law to become law. In the meantime, we assess her claim is wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07312"}
