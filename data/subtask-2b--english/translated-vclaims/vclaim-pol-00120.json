According to a Facebook post on February 9, a deceased CBS commentator identified Christianity in his prayer. \"Christians are only sick and tired of turning the other cheek while our courts strip us of all our rights,\" says Ronnie Post in a long comment. \"Our grandparents taught us to pray before eating, and pray before we go to sleep. Our Bible tells us to pray without stopping. Now a bunch of people and their lawyers are telling us to stop praying. Oh, my God, help us. And if the last sentence offends you, well, sue me.\" Facebook was published on February 7, 2021 in an article on Facebook, \"The Devil was diagnosed in the Super Bowl of Satan.\" \u2022 On February 8, 2012, Bill McCarthy referred to this article, in which he participated more than 379,000 times, as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation in his news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This is because most of the words attributed to Andy Ronnie in this article were actually written by Nick Golson, who was then a sports editor in Times Record News in Wichita Falls, Texas. The column does not include the \"2019/2020\" crowd cry that appears on Facebook. The Gholson editorial was published in September 1999, and you can read it in another newspaper here.
