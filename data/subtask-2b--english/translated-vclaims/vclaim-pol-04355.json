The NBC host Matt Lower listed some of the things Trump and Putin said about each other, and asked if Trump wanted to impress someone who was in conflict with United States foreign policy and might be involved in the election. \"I said, \"I'll tell you, in terms of driving, he's getting an excellent score, and our boss is not well. When I referred to Putin's comment about you, I think he called you a genius leader, and I said, \"It's always a great honor to be so kind to a gentleman inside and outside his country,\" Lor said. \"But do you want to be complimentary by former KBG officer?\" \"Well, I guess when they call me a genius, I'll take the compliment, okay?\" Trump said, \"The truth is, see, she won't get it anywhere. I'm a negotiator.\" While Laur and Trump claimed that Putin called Trump \"Brilliant\" during the forum, we put the Trump statement on the truth O-Meter. It's not the first time Trump has mentioned \"really nice things\" that Putin said about him. In two campaign events in February, three times in April, in May on CNN, in a march in June in California, twice in July, and in a municipal hall in August in Ohio Trump, he referred to Putin's comments in December 2015, when he asked about his ideas about a billionaire by ABC reporter. \"He's a very colorful person. The gifted, no doubt, but it is not up to us to decide our merit - and that is up to the American electorate. But he's definitely the leader in the presidential race, \"reads comments on the ABC video. The Russian President's words in translation have been lost in some corners of the American press. CNN, Bazvid, Washington, D.C., New York Post, the Hill, all quoted from Putin calling Trump \"talented and talented.\" At the same time, translation from the British and Russian media was closer to the original ABC video. Reuters mentioned that Putin called Trump \"very talented, very talented.\" BBC interpreted the comments as \"very colorful and talented.\" The Guardian amended an earlier version of his article from Brilliant to \"Very Colorful.\" The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" By Samantha Buterman: 11 January 2021 RT, the Russian government-funded television network, she quoted Putin as saying \"very bright.\" According to Sputnik, a news agency also controlled by the Kremlin, Putin said \"very bright.\" What explains these different interpretations? The word Putin used was \"arkey\" or \"arkey,\" which meant \"bright\" or \"brilliant.\" However, while the word \"bright\" and \"brillant\" in English are synonyms for both \"feed\" and \"intelligence,\" the word \"arkey\" in Russian does not have the second meaning. Putin used \"arkey\" mainly to mean \"color\" or \"strong personality,\" and Harley Balzer, a Russian expert at Georgetown University, said that he saw \"nothing to support \"sea\" in the intelligent sense of Putin's comments in December. Russian language experts told our friends in Vakchik. Org the same thing. In an interview in June with Fred Zakaria of CNN, Putin denied himself the \"brilliant\" translation. \"I have made some comments about the American Republican candidate Donald Trump. I called it polite, \"excellent\" and \"talented,\" said Zachariah. \"These comments have been reported worldwide. I was wondering what led you to this verdict and do you still keep that judgment?\" \"Why do you always change the meaning of what you said?\" Putin responded through an interpreter. \"I just said he was a \"good guy.\" Isn't he bright? It is. I didn't say anything else about him.\" The Governor Trump said that Putin called me smart. This is an inaccurate translation of Putin's actual comments. The word he used was \"arkey,\" which meant \"bright\" as in the neighborhood or color, not smart or smart. We appreciate Trump's claim that it is often false. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/afde471-d5d0-48dc-ad0-f5a5afa1a35b", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04355"}
