On every day in mid April, it shows Virginia ranked either 49th or 50th among states in covid-19 testing per capita.\nOn April 21 - the date of this writing - Virginia was last. It had conducted 58,394 tests, or, on a per capita basis, 738 tests per 100,000 residents. The next lowest was California, at 747 tests per 100,000.\nAcross the U.S., 1,168 tests had been conducted per 100,000. New York, hardest hit by covid-10, had tested a leading 3,851 per 100,000.\u00a0\nHere\u2019s how Virginia compared to its neighbors, in number of tests per 100.000:\n\n\nWest Virginia, 1,514;\n\n\nTennessee, 1,479;\n\n\nMaryland, 1,142;\n\n\nKentucky, 941;\n\n\nNorth Carolina, 794;\n\n\nVirginia, 738.\u00a0\n\n\nOn April 10, when Stoney made his statement, Virginia was 49th in per capita testing, leading Kansas.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Virginia has been at the bottom in testing, other Johns Hopkins data shows it ranks in the middle in the spread of the disease. On April 21, there had been 110 infected Virginians per 100,000. That\u2019s 21st per capita.\nThe controversy\nTesting numbers have a huge role in debate in Virginia and across the country over when\u00a0governors should ease their stay-at-home restrictions and allow widespread business reopenings.\nPresident Donald Trump has called for lifting restrictions and is urging\u00a0supporters to \"liberate\" several states where Democratic governors issued the orders.\u00a0That includes Virginia, where Gov. Ralph Northam's order lasts until June 10. Virginia has seen several recent protests demanding Northam open the state now.\nNortham, a pediatric neurologist, says he set the date cautiously, noting that some projections show the virus may not peak in Virginia until late May. He recently appointed a work group to ramp up Virginia\u2019s testing. \"The ability to run large numbers of tests is key to lifting restrictions on businesses and gathering,\" Northam said at an April 20 news conference.\nNortham\u2019s explanation\nThe governor and his advisors say they\u2019ve had trouble competing with other states for scarce testing supplies. \"We\u2019re scouring the country for the equipment to help our institutions increase testing,\" Daniel Carey, Virginia\u2019s Secretary of Health and Human Resources, said on April 17. \"We just haven\u2019t been successful because of the national shortage, but we realize we have to get significantly more testing\u2026\"\nNortham says\u00a0Trump\u00a0has given \"limited guidance\"\u00a0on how states can work through the competition.\nMany governors have voiced similar complaints. The Northam administration also gives reasons that may be unique to Virginia.\nCommissioner of Health Norman Oliver says Virginia had a slow start because - unlike some other states - no Virginia hospitals or labs developed their own tests. That meant, for a while, Virginia had to rely almost solely on the state lab for testing. The state lab was so crunched, Oliver says, that it set guidelines that limited testing to the most vulnerable patients.\u00a0 As a result, he says, many Virginia physicians didn\u2019t seek tests for patients showing mild covid-19 symptoms.\nCarey also says\u00a0Virginia\u2019s method of reporting tests may create a time lag that hurts Virginia when compared to other states.\nNortham says Virginia\u2019s has improved as the state\u2019s private labs, universities and hospitals have begun creating their own tests. During the first three weeks of April, the total number of tests conducted in Virginia has quadrupled. Many\u00a0states have\u00a0seen similar expansions.\nNortham told clinicians this week they should start testing anyone who\u2019s symptomatic. And the state\u2019s now testing all patients and workers in extended-care facilities.\nOur ruling\nOn April 10, Stoney said Virginia has \"lagged behind other states when it comes to (covid-19) testing.\"\u00a0\nOn any given date from the eve of the mayor's statement through this\u00a0April 21 writing, Virginia has been last, or next to last, in per capita testing.\u00a0 So we rate Stoney\u2019s statement True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16985"}
