Jon Richards, D-Milwaukee.\nIt\u2019s an extreme claim.\nHas Richards said he would only enforce laws he agrees with?\nThe AG race\nRichards and two district attorneys -- Susan Happ of Jefferson County and Ismael Ozanne of Dane County -- will compete in the Aug. 12, 2014 primary, with the winner facing Schimel, the Waukesha County district attorney, in the Nov. 4, 2014 general election. Republican incumbent J.B. Van Hollen is not seeking a third four-year term.\nAll four candidates have stated they wouldn\u2019t defend certain laws, saying they violate the state or U.S. constitution. That could saddle taxpayers with higher costs because private attorneys could be brought in to do that work.\nThe three Democrats said they wouldn't defend or appeal rulings on the state's ban on gay marriage, its voter ID law, or recent abortion regulations. Schimel said he would not defend Wisconsin's domestic partnership law, which gives same-sex couples some of the rights of married couples.\nThose positions drew criticism from Madison lawyer Lester Pines, who supports Ozanne in the attorney general race. After social conservatives in 2009 sued to block the domestic partnership law, Van Hollen refused to defend it. Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle then hired Pines to defend the law.\nWisconsin's attorney general has a legal and professional duty to defend every state law unless the only arguments that can be made on its behalf are frivolous, Pines told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in a June 14, 2014 article. Disliking a law or even believing a law is unconstitutional, he said, is not enough to abandon the duty to defend it.\nSchimel's claim\nAsked to provide evidence for Schimel\u2019s claim, campaign manager Johnny Koremenos argued that Richards has two standards in deciding whether to defend a law, \"the Constitution and the \u2018wishes of the people.\u2019\"\n\"This signals he will disregard the law and replace it with his perception of the \u2018wishes of the people,\u2019\" Koremenos said. \"It\u2019s clear he is willing to place his own values and personal beliefs above the Constitution.\"\nKoremenos also cited several news articles. But only two of them, both from February 2014, contain comments from Richards about his personal beliefs.\nAnd in neither case does Richards say he would enforce only laws he agrees with.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin LeMahieu\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a TV interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It takes quite a while on Election Day to load those ballots, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, an article in the Madison weekly newspaper Isthmus -- about whether efforts to repeal Wisconsin\u2019s ban on gay marriage could benefit Democrats in the fall 2014 elections -- noted that Richards said in a news release he would not defend the state\u2019s ban on same-sex marriage, which voters added to the state constitution in 2006.\nRichards has said he believes the ban violates the U.S. constitution and that he personally favors allowing same-sex marriage.\n\"Given Richards\u2019 proactive stance, it's clear he doesn\u2019t see same-sex marriage as a negative on the campaign trail,\" the Isthmus article stated.\nThe article also said Richards\u2019 political director, Andy Suchorski, did not disagree with this assessment, but that Richards\u2019 position is \"not a political thing for him. It\u2019s something he really believes. It\u2019s why we\u2019re pushing it.\u2019\"\nThat might seem like support for Schimel\u2019s claim. But only regarding one law and only if taken out of context.\nSuchorski told us he had been asked a political question -- whether Richards was talking about gay marriage in the campaign because it was good for Democrats -- and had not been asked any legal questions. And the article itself is framed as a political analysis.\nSchimel also pointed to the first paragraph of a brief version of an Associated Press news story, which stated Richards had pledged to be \"the people\u2019s attorney general\" if elected, and that he said Richards wouldn\u2019t defend every state law if he thinks it violates the U.S. Constitution or goes against the wishes of the people.\nSo, that\u2019s an indication that Richards might not defend some laws if he thinks they are against the public\u2019s wishes, but not that he would defend only laws he supports.\nIndeed, the full version of the AP article noted that Richards said he would defend laws with which he disagrees, though he didn\u2019t provide an example during that particular news conference.\nHowever, despite Schimel\u2019s claim, Richards has actually stated that he would defend laws he doesn\u2019t support if he believes they are constitutional.\nRichards campaign spokesman Sachin Chheda pointed to three such occasions:\n\n\nIn March 2014, Richards told the Waukesha Freeman newspaper: \"There are going to be times when there are laws that I voted against and personally might not support but I believe are consistent with the state and United States constitution, so, of course, the Department of Justice will defend them in that situation.\"\n\n\n\n\nIn January 2014 on the \"Upfront with Mike Gousha\" public affairs TV show, Richards was asked if he would vigorously enforce the state\u2019s voter ID law if it is upheld in court. Richards called the law \"troubling,\" but said: \u00a0\"Obviously, If the law is passed, and a court rules that it\u2019s constitutional, we\u2019ll uphold the law, of course. But I do think the law that\u2019s written really needs some scrutiny.\"\n\n\n\n\nAlso in January 2014, Richards was asked by WisPolitics.com if concealed carry \"is the right thing for Wisconsin.\" Richards said several aspects of the law were \"problematic\" in terms of public safety, but he added:\n\n\n\"Having said that, I mean, the law is in place and as attorney general I would certainly work to make sure that if people apply for a concealed weapons permit, that it\u2019s handled in a professional manner, quickly and expeditiously, and that we obey the law and we get those permits issued.\"\nOur rating\nSchimel said Richards \"went so far to say he would only enforce the laws with which he personally agreed.\"\nHe provides no evidence that Richards made such a statement. On the contrary, Richards has said on multiple occasions he would enforce laws with which he doesn\u2019t agree.\nWe rate Schimel\u2019s statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07599"}
