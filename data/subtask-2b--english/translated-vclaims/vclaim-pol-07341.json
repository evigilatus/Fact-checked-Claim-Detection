In an e-mail for the campaign, Gillespie said: \"It is a law that interrupts medical care for older persons, and it includes reasons why it is opposed to the health-care law. This is a well-transmitted allegation that Polyte Factor has met a great deal over the years. Paul Logan, the spokesperson for the Gillespi campaign, supported this statement, in part, with the vagueness of the fact-checking written by our colleagues in two other polyte fruit offices. He referred to a national article by Politi Fah 2013 examining Scott Brown's claim -- the Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate in New Hampshire -- that Obamakari \"raises taxes and reduces medical care. ===Polic Fact===The two-track statement was mostly correct, saying that the law \"lifts taxes without limits\" to help pay for it. However, our colleagues also said that the claim that Obama &apos; s health care programme shortens medical care is a complex issue that reduces the accuracy of Brown &apos; s full claim. Poletti Fruitte looked at the question about the naked statements that Obama Care was cutting off medical care, categorizing it either half right or often wrong depending on how it was drafted. The Obama Care Program has also imposed a series of savings to help cover its costs. Among these measures, the increase in medical care will be reduced by $716 billion from 2013 to 2022, according to estimates by the Budget Office of Congress. It is important to note that spending on medical care will continue to rise, but at a slower pace than would have been achieved without the law. The savings focus on reducing payments to hospitals and insurance companies - not to beneficiaries. Gillespie says Obama Carrie cuts off \"medical care for older persons.\" This indicates that the law not only reduces spending on medical care, but in fact cuts off the benefits of medical care. In support of this logic, Logan referred to two articles entitled PoliticsFact, in which experts suggested that the reduction of payments called for by law could affect patients &apos; access to services. In October 2012, Polytechnic Wisconsin noted concerns that slow growth in medical care payments may discourage some health-care providers from accepting medical care patients. One area of concern is the Medical Care Benefits Program, run by private insurance companies, which provides greater benefits than traditional medical care for such things as dental care, free eyeglasses and gym membership. Check the facts (Kirk Cox) was mentioned on January 13, 2021 in a speech. Virginia ranked lowest third of the states in the management of the COVID-19 vaccine. \u2022 On 20 January 2021, about 30 per cent of the 54 million medical-care beneficiaries in the United States were registered in those plans, according to the estimates of the Kaiser Family Foundation. These privately run schemes cost more to every beneficiary of traditional medical care, and Obama seeks to compensate for these costs. On the other hand, Gillespie does not mention that the Health Care Act already adds some new services: it gradually fills the gap in the coverage of medicines described as \"the nuts gap,\" finances disease prevention benefits and expands preventive care benefits. Logan also referred us to statements made by former American Sir Jim Webb, De-Fa. In March 2010, Webb said that Obama's care programme would \"make dramatic cuts in medical care\" and regretted the cuts in the benefit of medical care. Here's a quick note on Gillespie's e-mail timing. Logan told us that he was originally sent in January and was offended by the campaign in August 25, after the Daily Press in Newport News - which published the weekly Polyte Vak Virginia magazine - had recently signed for automatic electronic updates from the campaign. \"Unless you want to single out that signature, it would be more accurate to refer to it as an e-mail in January rather than an e-mail on August 25,\" said Logan. And because e-mail is part of the ongoing communications of Obama's care campaign -- that Gilsby's campaign feels free to re-dispatch -- we think it's fair to judge it as a current line of attack from Gilsby's law campaign. Our referee Gillespie says that Obamakari \"cuts medical care for older persons,\" a statement that implies that the law reduces benefits in all areas. There is discussion among analysts about how savings measures will affect the costs imposed by the law on some beneficiaries, particularly older persons enrolled in medical care benefit schemes administered by private insurance companies. Some older persons - who make up about 30 per cent of the beneficiaries of medical care - may lose some of the additional benefits they have received before the law or may see higher premiums. In general, the health care law slows down the growth of medical care, but spending will continue to increase significantly, adding some new services for older persons. Thus, Gillespie's statement is often miscalculated.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07341"}
