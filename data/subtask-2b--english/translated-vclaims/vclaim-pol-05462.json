And they give up the political process because they understand that the economy is fake,\" said Sanders. \"They work longer hours for low wages. They're worried about the future of their children. And yet almost all the new income and wealth will go to the top 1%,\" he said. \"That's not what America's supposed to be about.\" Poletti Fuckett has investigated some of the differences in his claims regarding wages, hours of work and income distribution. In the past, Saunders said wages were down. This allegation was not made on Thursday night, perhaps because when we looked at the data, we found that most of the reports concluded that wages had been fixed since the 1970s. Instead, characterization of wages as low, value judgement we will not manipulate. On the issue of watches, we found mixed evidence that Americans work longer during the week. The best data, from the Office of Labour Statistics, show the average weekly hours of production and unsupervised staff in the private sector that have actually declined slightly since the 1960s. The trend was reversed at the beginning of this century and a temporary decline took place during the Great Depression, but overall the figures do not support the demand for longer hours. Gallup surveys found that workers report working hours longer than BLS figures show. However, historical data from Gallup surveys reveal that there has been no change in the number of hours reported by full-time employees working between 2001 and 2014. On the other hand, when the Brookings Institution looked at a small segment of the middle class -- 10% of households in the middle -- they found an increase in working hours among mothers who worked longer to maintain the standard of living of their families. Finally, there is a lot of data that shows that new income has become concentrated in the richest Americans, the overall theme of Sanders. The question is to what extent On January 16, 2021, Jordan Rachel stated in Tweedda that the minimum wage of $15 per hour would raise the price of taco bill burrito to $38. By Bill McCarthy, 20 January 2021 Sanders said on Thursday night and during recent interviews that \"almost everything\" was a new income. A year ago, he was saying it was 99 percent. There is no useful formula, globally agreed for calculating a specific quantity, but the economy on which Saunders relied in 2015 concluded that the highest 1% had accumulated 91% of income gains from 2009 to 2012. That would be \"almost everything.\" However, when the analysis was updated in 2015, the estimate fell to 58 per cent, a proportion that Sanders publicly acknowledged. This may only be more than most of the new income, but it is far from \"almost everything.\" One of the important caveats: one of the economists we consulted told us that the calculation on which Sanders relies, which looks at pre-tax income minus all government payments, uses a method that tends to make the rich richer. Our rule, Sanders, said the Americans \"work longer hours for low wages... yet almost all new income and wealth will go to the top 1%.\" The issues are whether Americans work longer hours -- on average, they're not -- and whether \"almost all\" income and new wealth will go to the top 1%. Many of them, but not \"almost everything.\" If Saunders argued that a disproportionate amount of income and wealth would go to the richest Americans, he would be right to money. But he's overreacting. We're assessing this claim half right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05462"}
