In a strike at Trump, Clinton said her immigration plan would bring undocumented migrants from shadows and protect them from employers like Trump for exploitation. She said, \"Donald knows a lot about this.\" \"Undocumented labour has been used to build the Trump Tower. Undocumented workers were adequately paid, and when they complained, he basically said what many employers were doing: \"You complain, and I will drive you away.\" \"This line of attack is similar to that used by a major Trump rival, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who in February accused him of recruiting \"illegal\" Polish workers into a construction project decades ago. We assessed Rubio &apos; s claim for half the right because it attributed more blame to Trump and mentioned a separate issue of legal settlement. There is also more evidence in support of Clinton &apos; s simpler statement. Between 1979 and 1980, Trump hired a contractor to destroy a building from Manhattan to eventually make way for the Trump Tower. This contractor also employed local trade union workers as well as 200 undocumented Polish workers to meet tight deadlines. According to media reports, Polish employees are paid from books and work in shifts of 12 hours per day for only $4 to $5 per hour without extra pay. According to Time magazine, Trump requested workers after seeing them in another construction job, and then, through his lawyer, threatened to contact immigration services during a dispute over unpaid wages. In 1983, trade union members appointed to work on the project filed an action against Trump, a trade union leader and contractor for the use of undocumented Polish workers to reduce their pensions and social welfare funds. The next Republican presidential candidate appeared before the court in 1990 and denied being aware that the workers were not legally in the country, but the Manhattan judge ended up judging Trump and ordering him to pay more than $325,000 to the workers. On January 13, 2021, in a story written by General David Berger, the commander of the United States Navy, he rejected Nancy Belusi's request for the use of marines for security, saying, \"We are not working for you.\" By Samantha Buterman on January 17, 2021, Trump appealed the case, which lasted for another decade, before settling quietly out of court in 1999. The alleged Republican candidate for undocumented workers continued to be employed even in the current presidential campaign. A number of construction workers interviewed by the Washington Post in July 2015 stated that they had been appointed to assist in the renovation of the old post office wing in Washington despite their illegal stay in the country. A spokesman for Trump at the time said that his trade and contractors followed all immigration laws in force. Our referee, Clinton, claimed that Trump was using undocumented labor to build Trump Tower. There is no doubt that undocumented workers have been hired to carry out demolition work at the future location of Trump Tower. There are still questions about the extent to which Trump was involved in the construction and employment of the 200 Polish workers, but Clinton is in fact right to say that undocumented employment helped build the New York skyscraper for Trump. We appreciate this statement as correct. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/533008da5-515b-4693-b9b8-f3728465b962", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04093"}
