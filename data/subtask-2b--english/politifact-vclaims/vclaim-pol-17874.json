The Black community is the easiest to manipulate.\"\nThe post says Soros, a billionaire investor and philanthropist who donates to Democratic political causes, made that statement in September 2014 in an \"interview with Germany\u2019s BILD.\"\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nBild is a German publication. Using Google, we searched for references to \"George Soros\" on Bild\u2019s website in 2014. We found one result: an April 3, 2014, story with the headline, \"So irre l\u00e4stern Bulgariens Politiker,\" which Google translates to \"Bulgaria\u2019s politicians are so insane.\"\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe article describes how Bulgarian politicians called government protesters \"\u2018Sorosoids\u2019 \u2014\u00a0a newly created derogatory word for employees of the billionaire George Soros Foundation or other western non-governmental organizations.\"\u00a0\nThere are no other mentions of Soros in the story.\u00a0\nNext, we searched online and in Nexis news archives but found nothing resembling the quote. Soros is a heavily scrutinized figure who is the regular subject of conspiracy theories and misinformation. If in 2014 he made the statement that appears in the Facebook post \u2014\u00a0even in a non-English language \u2014 it would make American news. But we found nothing to corroborate the post.\u00a0\nFinally, we reached out to Open Society Foundations, the philanthropic organization founded by Soros. The group told us that there\u2019s no truth to the post.\u00a0\nWe rate if False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17874"}
