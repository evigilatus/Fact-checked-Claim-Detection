Michele Bachmann made a claim that jolted us out\u00a0of our seats.\n\n\"After the debates that we had last week, PolitiFact came out and said that everything that I said was true,\" she said.\n\nIt came during an exchange between Bachmann, a Minnesota Republican, and former\u00a0House Speaker Newt Gingrich. Bachmann was attacking Gingrich\u2019s work after he left Congress. He has said he was a paid consultant, but critics such as Bachmann contend he was really a lobbyist.\n\nGingrich defended his work on behalf of the government-sponsored mortgage-bundling giant Freddie Mac, arguing that government does not necessarily taint whatever enterprise it touches.\n\nHe added, \"I did no lobbying of any kind for any organization. That was a key part of\u00a0every agreement we had.\"\n\nChallenged by moderator Chris Wallace for hard evidence, Bachmann said that \"we know that (Gingrich)\u00a0 cashed paychecks from Freddie Mac. That\u2019s the best evidence that you can have. Over $1.6 million. \u2026 The speaker had his hand out and he was taking $1.6 million to influence senior Republicans to keep the scam going in Washington, D.C. That\u2019s absolutely wrong. We can\u2019t have as our nominee for the Republican party someone who continues to stand for Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. They need to be shut down, not built up.\"\n\nGingrich responded, \"Well, the easiest answer is, that's just not true. What she just said is factually not true. I never lobbied under any circumstance. I never went in and suggested in any way that we do this. In fact, I tried to help defeat the housing act when the Democrats were in charge of the House. And if you go back and talk to former\u00a0Congressman Rick Lazio, he'll tell you, when we were passing housing reform while I was speaker, I never at any time tried to slow down the reform effort. In fact, I helped him pass the reform bill. And I think some of those people ought to have facts before they make wild allegations.\"\n\nAt that point, Bachmann jumped back in. \"Well, after the debates that we had last week, PolitiFact came out and said that everything that I said was true. And the evidence is that Speaker Gingrich took $1.6 million. You don't need to be within the technical definition of being a lobbyist to still be influence-peddling with senior Republicans in Washington, D.C., to get them to do your bidding.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWait... what? We said that \"everything\" Bachmann had said was true?\n\nActually, that's not what we said.\n\nAt the Dec. 10 debate she was referring to, PolitiFact checked two claims from Bachmann and rated them Mostly True and Pants on Fire.\n\nThe fact-check she may have been referencing was, \"In 1993, Newt Gingrich \u2018first advocated for the individual mandate in health care. And as recently as May of this year, he was still advocating\u2019 for it.\" We rated that one a Mostly True.\n\nBut we also rated her claim that Mitt Romney, as governor of Massachusetts, \"put into place socialized medicine.\" We found that was ridiculously false and rated it Pants on Fire.\n\nHer comment about our ratings was also a bit of a non-sequitur. Neither of the two items we checked addressed the subject at hand -- Gingrich\u2019s work for Freddie Mac, what he thinks of Freddie Mac today, or whether Gingrich was ever a lobbyist.\n\nMaybe Bachmann was simply trying to burnish her image as a truth teller. However, using PolitiFact to back up that assertion is a bit unusual. Her PolitiFact report card shows 59 percent of her statements rated have earned either a False or Pants on Fire. She has earned five Trues, three Mostly Trues, six Half Trues, seven Mostly Falses, 19 Falses and 11 Pants on Fires.\n\nOur ruling\n\nDuring the Sioux City debate, Bachmann said that \"after the debate that we had last week, PolitiFact came out and said that everything I said was true.\" That\u2019s simply not the case. We rated two statements by Bachmann from that debate and ruled one of them Mostly True and the other one Pants on Fire. So for claiming she had a perfect record,\u00a0she earns another Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11931"}
