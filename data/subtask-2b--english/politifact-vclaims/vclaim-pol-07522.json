Fischer claimed that Obama was using the MH 17 downing as a platform to legitimize gay relationships.\n\"Obama politicizes deaths of AIDS researchers on Malaysian plane. We know how to stop AIDS: persuade men not to have sex with men,\" Fischer said in a\u00a0message on Twitter\u00a0that was retweeted 66 times and attracted national attention.\u00a0\nHis comments were lambasted by writers of The Daily Beast, Salon and Patheos. Still, Fischer doubled down in another tweet and column. We wanted to dig into the facts behind his claim that the way to stop AIDS is to \"persuade men not to have sex with men.\"\nFischer\u2019s evidence\nExperts say Fischer\u2019s idea of an AIDS solution is highly flawed.\nBut Fischer stood by his claim in an interview with PunditFact, citing a report from UNAIDS that the rate of HIV is 19 times higher among men who have sex with men than the adult population. Also, he said that while his tweet isolated on men having sex with men, he made a somewhat broader argument on his radio show.\u00a0\n\"We know how to stop the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Persuade men not to have sex with men,\" he said on his radio show\u00a0Focal Point.\u00a0\"Persuade prostitutes to go straight, and persuade people not to shoot up with drugs. If we can get everybody persuaded to do that, then the epidemic begins to diminish overnight.\"\nDr. Stefan Baral, a Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health epidemiology professor and director of the Key Populations Program of the Center for Public Health and Human Rights, said Fischer\u2019s post on Twitter\u00a0reveals a misunderstanding about human nature and societal behavior.\n\"His recommendation is akin to making recommendations for people not to drive cars for fear of car accidents or riding a bike for fear of falling,\" Baral said in an email. \"In other words, this is a natural and healthy normal practice that in the context of an additional determinant induces risk. It would not be dissimilar from saying that there would be no cervical cancer if heterosexual people didn\u2019t have sex.\"\nHIV/AIDS overview\nThere is no cure for AIDS or HIV, the virus that leads to AIDS and ravages the body\u2019s immune system if untreated.\nThe statistics are staggering. About 35 million people have HIV in the world, including about 3.3 million children and 1 million Americans, according to the Foundation for AIDS Research, or amfAR. Among Americans, about 50,000 are newly infected each year, and 18 percent do not know they have the virus.\nIn 2012, 1.6 million people died from AIDS, which was a 30 percent drop from 2005, according to UNAIDS.\nIn the United States, gay men contract the virus at disproportionate rates to their share of the American population. In 2010, men who have sex with men comprised 78 percent of new HIV infections among men -- 63 percent of all new infections -- even though they made up just 4 percent of the male American population, according to the CDC.\nStill, preventing men from having sex with men (if that were even feasible) will not end HIV/AIDS in the United States.\u00a0About 20 percent of Americans infected with HIV in 2010 were women, mainly through heterosexual sex, according to the CDC.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHIV is carried through body fluids. The virus is passed when HIV-infected fluids enter the bloodstream of someone else, such as through contact with a cut or sore, sharing needles or syringes, or through the vagina, rectum, mouth, or tip of the penis.\nIn the United States, anal sex is the highest-risk behavior for spreading HIV, followed by vaginal sex, sex with multiple partners and sharing needles with someone infected with HIV.\nMother-to-child transmissions are not common in the United States thanks to widespread HIV testing of pregnant women and drugs that prevent the virus from affecting a child. Neither is getting the virus through blood transfusions and organ donations and transplants, which are intensely tested for HIV.\nBut what\u2019s true for Americans is not true for other people in the world.\nWorld picture\nAbout 70 percent of all people infected with HIV live in sub-Saharan Africa, about 24 million people. This region is also home to the most children living with HIV whose infections originated during pregnancy, childbirth of consuming breast milk, according to AIDS.gov.\nGlobally, the dominant form of transmission is heterosexual sex, said Sophie Barton Knott, UNAIDS spokeswoman. Nearly half of people with HIV are female, and most were infected through heterosexual sex. Most of the 50.9 percent of men with HIV got it through heterosexual sex, too, she said.\nThe highest rates of AIDS among 15- to 24-year-olds is among women in many parts of the world, said Seth Faison, spokesman for The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. And in Eastern Europe, the highest transmission rates of AIDS are among people who inject drugs.\n\"Men who have sex with men are a high-risk group, but not the only one,\" he said.\nThe bottom line?\nPreventing men from having sex with men will not end AIDS.\nFaison said the criminalization of same-sex activity actually can increase transmission rates. Being gay is a crime in at least 76 countries, and in those places, gay men are less likely to receive treatment, testing and prevention.\nThe CDC also says stigma and homophobia are likely one factor behind the rise in HIV infections among young gay men in the United States.\n\"In effect, efforts to \u2018persuade men not to have sex with men\u2019 is counterproductive,\" Faison said. \"It will not stop AIDS.\"\nOur ruling\nFischer said, \"We know how to stop AIDS: persuade men not to have sex with men.\"\nThough men who have sex with men are at the highest risk of contracting HIV/AIDS in America, this is not a serious solution to ending a pandemic disease. Not in the United States, and certainly not worldwide.\nWomen, children, and men who don\u2019t have sex with men are also at risk, and women make up about half of people worldwide who have HIV/AIDS.\nFischer\u2019s claim is ridiculous.
