And this fiscal year we will pass that,\" Cuccinelli said. \"People who come after the president and this administration, say, \u2018Oh you know, you don't like immigrants.\u2019 Well, we are letting more people become citizens than has happened in years.\"\nPerino said she didn\u2019t think people realize that. \"No, they don\u2019t,\" Cuccinelli responded.\nIs it true that more immigrants are becoming U.S. citizens than has happened in years? In total numbers, yes. But the approval rate isn\u2019t the highest it\u2019s been in recent years. And the number Cuccinelli mentioned is inflated.\nNaturalization data\nGenerally, before becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen, immigrants must pay a fee, pass a civics test and a background check, have lawful permanent residence for at least five years, and meet other criteria. The final step to becoming a U.S. citizen is taking an Oath of Allegiance to the United States at a naturalization ceremony.\nPolitiFact asked USCIS for data backing Cuccinelli\u2019s claim about the Trump administration letting more people become citizens than has happened in years.\nIn 2018, USCIS approved around 756,800 naturalization applications. That beat approval numbers in 2017, 2016, 2015, and 2014. The last time naturalization approvals were higher than 2018 was 2013 \u2014 around 779,900.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Fox News Sunday interview, when asked about how many people were naturalized, Cuccinelli said \"we were in the range of 850,000\" in 2018. But that number refers to applications completed \u2014 both approved and denied. Around 849,500 applications were completed in 2018, according to USCIS\u2019s report.\u00a0\nNaturalization approvals in 2018 \u2014 756,800 \u2014 weren\u2019t that much higher than in 2016, the last full fiscal year of the Obama administration. In 2016, about 753,100 people were naturalized. That\u2019s a less than 1% increase in absolute numbers of naturalizations from 2016 to 2018.\n\nThe report USCIS sent PolitiFact had not just total numbers of people who became U.S. citizens, but also the approval rates.\nIn both fiscal years 2017 and 2018, the approval rate was 89%. In 2016, 90%.\nSo while the total number of people approved in 2018 is higher than in five years, the approval rate is not.\nOur ruling\nCuccinelli said, \"We are letting more people become citizens than has happened in years,\" and that it was 850,000 people last year.\nThe 850,000 represents applications completed \u2014 both approved and denied.\nIn fiscal year 2018, about 756,800 people became naturalized U.S. citizens. That\u2019s the highest number since 2013, when it was about 779,900.\u00a0\nOf all naturalization applications completed in 2018, 89% were approved. It was the same percentage in 2017. In 2016, 90% of applications were approved.\nCuccinelli\u2019s statement is partially accurate. We rate it Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00440"}
