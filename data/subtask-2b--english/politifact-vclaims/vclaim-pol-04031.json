The Republican presidential nominee did so again during a rally in Springfield, Ohio, on Oct. 27.\n\"Nearly half of African-American children under the age of 6 are living in abject poverty,\" Trump said.\nIt turns out that the poverty rate for young African-Americans is disproportionately high, but not nearly as high as Trump suggests.\nWhile the Trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry for this article, we suspect that he came across the statistic in a \"State of Working America\" report published by the liberal Economic Policy Institute.\nAn infographic packaged with the report said, \"45.8 percent of young black children (under age 6) live in poverty, compared to 14.5 percent of white children.\"\nIf that were a current statistic, Trump would be on pretty solid ground. But it\u2019s not.\nIt\u2019s not obvious from the infographic, but the State of Working America report was published in 2012. And the data itself is now six years old.\nThe full text of the report says, \"In 2010, close to half (45.8 percent) of young black children (under age 6) were in poverty, compared with 14.5 percent of white children.\"\nThe problem is that 2010 was during and just after the Great Recession, so poverty rates were unusually high.\nTo find out what the rates are now, we turned to data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The most recent data we found is for children under age 5 and covers 2015. That\u2019s slightly different, but Census data specific to poverty levels among children age six do not change the percentage significantly.\nFor African-Americans under five, the poverty rate was 37.4 percent. That\u2019s quite a bit lower than the \"almost half\" of African-American children that Trump cited.\nThe percentage falls even further if you give weight to Trump\u2019s use of the term \"abject poverty\" and look at the poorest of the poor -- those with incomes at half of the poverty level or less.\nFor African-Americans under 5, that half-of-poverty rate is 20.4 percent. That\u2019s even further from \"almost half.\"\nWe should note that compared to other racial and ethnic groups, the poverty levels for African-Americans are indeed high.

Still, the rates for African-American children are disproportionately high, so Trump has a point even if his statistics are too old and exaggerate the scale of poverty in that age group.
