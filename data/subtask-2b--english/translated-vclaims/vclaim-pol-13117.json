Well, we now have more shoes on the ground on the southwest border than ever in our history. The Border Patrol has 20,000 clients - more than double what it was in 2004, a build-up that began under the leadership of President Bush and continued.\" Obama said that the obligation goes beyond what some Republicans have requested \"who have said they support broader reform as long as we become serious about enforcement.\" \"I doubt there will be those who will try to move targets again,\" said Obama. \"They'll say we need three times the border patrol. Or four times the border patrol.\" Obama has written these statistics on border patrol agents in immigration letters before. In July 2010, we verified the President's claim that \"Today, we have shoes on the ground closer to the southwest border than ever in our history.\" (The same phrase as that used in El Paso.) Last month, our colleagues at Polyte Fact Georgia verified Obama's claim in a television interview that \"we now have more border patrol officers than we ever had in our history.\" We have estimated both of these allegations mostly true, noting that while the border patrol force is at its highest modern level, President Woodrow Wilson sent between 75,000 and 150,000 troops to the United States-Mexico border in 1916 to suppress a sudden attack in the city of Columbus in New Mexico by Bancho Villa, a military project also known as the Mexican flight in 1916. Here, we decided to focus on Obama's claim that \"the Border Patrol has 20,000 clients -- more than double the number of employees in 2004.\" There were 20,745 border patrol personnel on 9 April 2011; 17,659 were stationed along the south-western border with Mexico, according to data provided by Stephen Crepe, spokesman for the Ministry of Internal Security. This is more than 17,499 border patrol personnel at the end of September 2008, four months before Obama took office (18 per cent increase). The number increased from 15,422 to 17,659 (14 per cent increase). According to an analysis carried out by the Congressional Research Service on 3 March 2010 on border security, \"the workforce of border patrol officers assigned to the south-western border has been steadily increasing since the early 1990s. In 1992, there were 3,555 clients dedicated to the southern border, and by 2000, this number had risen by 141 per cent to 8,580. Since 2000, the number of agents assigned to the southern border has continued to increase, further doubling to 20,119 at the end of fiscal year 2009. The rapid and steady increase in the number of border patrol personnel assigned to the southern border reflects the continued interest of Congress in stopping the wave of illegal immigration.\" The report indicates that the 2011 budget proposal for Obama requested a reduction of 181 border patrol personnel. However, the Department &apos; s proposed budget for 2012 calls for an increase in the number of border patrol personnel to 21,370. Jack Martin, Director of Special Projects in the Union for the Reform of American Migration, who supports stricter guidelines for illegal migration, said that Obama's statistics were correct, but the biggest credit for starting the trend towards greater border security was Obama's predecessor. \"There was a constant build-up of BP officers for several years that gave momentum from 9/11 attacks,\" said Martin. \"The increase was necessarily gradual because it was limited by BP training facility capacity.\" In March 2011, the United States Government Accountability Office issued a report entitled \"Border Security: Progress and Challenges for the Department of Homeland Security in Securing the South-West and Northern Borders of the United States,\" in conjunction with a statement by the Director of the Public Accounting Office Richard Stana. The report emphasized that the staff and other resources required to stop the illegal crossing of the United States-Mexico border had increased dramatically in recent years. In 2004, the United States Department of National Security was established, and several federal agencies were reorganized under one roof. In that year, the Agency had 10,500 clients to patrol the land border. This number now stands at approximately 21,000. On January 13, 2021, the distinguished fact-checkers announced in a story in which General David H. Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for the use of marines for security purposes, saying, \"We are not working for you.\" On January 17, 2021, in other words, the workforce nearly doubled since 2004, as Obama said in his speech in El Paso. Once again, this trend began under President Bush, whom Obama owed, but continued under Obama. We're evaluating Obama's statement right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13117"}
