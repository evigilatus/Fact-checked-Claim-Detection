We don't win! We don't win on anything.\"\nMore recently, during an Oct. 10 rally in Ambridge, Pa., Trump offered a variation on that theme -- and the U.S. chess community wasn\u2019t happy about his remarks.\nTrump was in the midst of criticizing international trade agreements, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership. He said he supports the idea of bilateral agreements, saying that such deals would make it possible for the United States to threaten to withdraw, then renegotiate on more favorable terms before the agreement expired.\nTrump went on to say that with multilateral pacts like the TPP, \"you can't terminate -- there's too many people, you go crazy. It's like you have to be a grand chess master. And we don't have any of them.\" (You can see it here, around the 19:45 mark.)\nTrump\u2019s statement sounded wrong to us. The Trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry, but as it turns out, it is wrong. In fact, the comment provoked anger and ridicule within the chess community, which knows that the United States is currently on a roll in international competition.\nChess grandmasters\nIt\u2019s literally wrong that \"we don\u2019t have any\" chess grandmasters. That\u2019s the correct term, by the way, not \"grand chess masters.\"\nCurrently, the United States has 90 grandmasters, counting both men and women, which is enough to rank third-highest in the world. The title is awarded by FIDE, the international governing body of chess; it\u2019s the highest rank conferred by the group, and it is given for life.\nRussia, a longtime chess powerhouse, ranks first with 234 grandmasters, while Germany ranks second with 91, just one more than the United States. Here\u2019s a list of the top 30 nations in the FIDE rankings.\n\nRecent U.S. victories\nIn the meantime, Trump chose a particularly inopportune moment for his comment.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost notable is the victory less than a month earlier by the U.S. men\u2019s team at the 42nd Chess Olympiad in Baku, Azerbaijan -- which is considered the first time in nearly 80 years that the United States won the gold. To win in September, the United States bested such powerhouses as Russia, Ukraine, India and China.\nChess may not be the most popular sport in the United States, but observers called the Olympic victory a watershed moment for U.S. chess.\n\"The 2016 win in the Chess Olympiad is huge,\" said Olimpiu G. Urcan, a Singapore-based chess writer and historian. \"The previous Olympiad was won by China, and Russia and Ukraine are extremely competitive. Having the United\u00a0States\u00a0finish first was a huge boost for chess in America and a moment of genuine pride. Many in the U.S. right now believe that the successes of 2016 could produce a rejuvenation of chess\" similar to what happened with the international stardom of Bobby Fischer in the 1970s.\nMacauley Peterson, a Hamburg, Germany-based American who serves as content director for chess24, calls it \"frankly discouraging\" that the United States team \"received so little media attention. The number of U.S. grandmasters is higher than ever, and winning the Olympiad was a historic achievement.\"\nUrcan was among the first to notice Trump\u2019s quote and tweeted about it. That led to none other than Garry Kasparov -- probably the most famous living chess grandmaster -- to tweet his disbelief. Kasparov is Russian but is living in exile in New York City; he has been an outspoken critic of Russian leader Vladimir Putin.\nProud to see Trump knows as little about chess as everything else. Team USA just won gold at the chess Olympiad! https://t.co/k2Y3KBect3\u2014 Garry Kasparov (@Kasparov63) October 12, 2016\n\nHikaru Nakamura, a U.S. Olympic team member and currently the world\u2019s No. 7 ranked player, \u00a0joined in:\nWow. Just wow. What a disgrace on every level. https://t.co/aJY7haSslH\u2014 Hikaru Nakamura (@GMHikaru) October 12, 2016\n\nIn the meantime, the United States is home to 15-year-old grandmaster Jeffrey Xiong, who in August won the World Junior Chess Championship -- the first U.S. victory in the tournament in nearly two decades.\nAnd the United States is currently the only country to have three players in the world\u2019s top 10 list -- Nakamura, Fabiano Caruana and Wesley So.\n\nA final note: There is a long history of foreign players flocking to affiliate with the U.S. team. The victorious Olympic team includes Fabiano Caruana, a dual American and Italian citizen who had previously played for Italy, and Wesley So, who was born in the Philippines.\nOur ruling\nTrump said, \"We don't have any\" chess grandmasters in the United States. Actually, the United States has 90 grandmasters, the third most of any country, and the U.S. team recently won chess\u2019 biggest international tournament for the first time in eight decades. We rate the statement Pants on Fire.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/26f8a1ec-4030-4753-90d5-20a8f2b68838", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04136"}
