From Marshall to Da 5 Bloods, August Wilson\u2019s Ma Rainey\u2019s Black Bottom and several more, all were filmed during and between countless surgeries and chemotherapy. It was the honor of his career to bring King T\u2019Challa to life in Black Panther. He died at home, with his wife and family by his side.\"\nIn the days since, Facebook posts like this one have spread misinformation about Boseman\u2019s death, claiming that he was poisoned. An image of the actor above a headline on TorontoToday.net says: \"AUTOPSY: Chadwick Boseman was POISONED, homicide investigation begins.\"\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

We found no evidence to suggest an autopsy had occurred, much less that such an autopsy found evidence of poisoning.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on February 7, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Satan flashed in the halftime Super Bowl satanic ritual.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 February 8, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColon cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. Boseman had not spoken publicly about his diagnosis, and the news of his death startled fans, who grieved his passing on social media. But we found nothing to support the claims that others are now sharing on platforms like Facebook. Rather, they seem to follow the same pattern of other death hoaxes that spread after a high-profile person dies.\u00a0\nThe Toronto Today story says that \"police are now considering this a homicide, and will be holding a press conference in the next 48 hours,\" but no such news event has happened.\u00a0\nIf Boseman was actually killed, it would draw wide media coverage. Instead, this post has drawn articles fact-checking it.\u00a0\nWe rate this post Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18855"}
