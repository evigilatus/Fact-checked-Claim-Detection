Trent Franks, R-Ariz., has been active in the nation\u2019s capital recently, lobbying for legislation he introduced that would ban abortions based on race or gender.\nCritics say the proposed ban is \"stereotyping,\" as women seek abortions for a multitude of reasons, such as financial constraints.\nFranks presented a series of abortion statistics at an April 14 House subcommittee hearing on the legislation, called the Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act, or PRENDA.\n\"Today in America, between 40 and 50 percent of all African-American babies, virtually 1-in-2\u00a0are killed before they are born, which is a greater cause of death for African-Americans than heart disease, cancer, diabetes, AIDS and violence combined,\" Franks said.\nThe congressman\u2019s matter-of-fact claim intrigued us, so we decided to check it out.\nLimited data\nFranks\u2019 spokeswoman, Destiny Edwards, referenced multiple reports from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights, for his claim.\nBecause Franks is talking specifically about abortion, we did not account for babies who may die as a result of domestic violence, for example, before birth.\nGuttmacher notes that African-American women accounted for an estimated 37 percent of the 1.21 million total abortions performed in 2008. That would in theory translate to 447,700 abortions. That same year, according to the CDC, 670,809 African-American babies were born.\nBut Guttmacher\u2019s abortion data is based on surveys with women and abortion providers. It is not a complete picture.\nPlus, total abortions dropped to about 1.06 million in 2011, but Guttmacher doesn\u2019t have updated demographic breakdowns, Guttmacher Institute spokeswoman Rebecca Wind said.\nThe CDC\u2019s data is similarly imperfect.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMitt Romney\n\n\nstated on April 26, 2007 in Stratham, N.H.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"(McCain) said he was opposed to overturning Roe v. Wade. Now he's for overturning Roe v. Wade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Angie Drobnic Holan \u2022 August 23, 2007\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we\u2019ve noted in a previous abortion claim from PolitiFact Florida, the CDC does not have a complete record of abortions. Most states require hospitals, facilities and physicians to report all abortions to a central health agency. \u00a0\nBut not every state reports this abortion data to the feds -- and they\u2019re not required to either.\u00a0The data also leaves out more than 20 states, including Arizona, California and Florida.\nAccording to the CDC\u2019s 2012 data, the most recent available, the abortion ratio for non-Hispanic African-American women was 435 abortions per 1,000 African-American live births. But Nikki Mayes, a CDC spokeswoman, said\u00a0that interpreting the ratio as a percent wouldn't be fair.\u00a0Live births exclude stillbirths and miscarriages. According to the Mayo Clinic, 10 to 20 percent of all pregnancies end in miscarriage.\nThe second half of Franks\u2019 claim, comparing other causes of death, is even more complicated.\nCDC data is split among leading causes of death between African-American men and women.\nFor African-American men, the leading causes of death are heart disease (24.1 percent), cancer (23.3 percent) and accidents (5.5 percent). Diabetes accounts for 3.9 percent of deaths and HIV, not AIDS, makes up 2.1 percent.\nFor African-American women, it's heart disease (24.1 percent), cancer (22.6 percent) and stroke (6.4 percent). Diabetes among African-American women account for 4.6 percent of deaths, while accidents make up 2.8 percent of deaths.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nFranks said, \"Today in America, between 40 and 50 percent of all African-American babies, virtually 1-in-2\u00a0are killed before they are born.\"\nData suggests a disparity in the number of abortions performed on African-American women than other races.\nBut saying that \"between 40 and 50 percent of all African-American babies\" are aborted goes beyond the limits of the data. Federal data doesn\u2019t account for all 50 states, and fails to factor in pregnancies that end in a miscarriage.\nPrivate data is based on surveys and is years out of date.\nWe rate Franks\u2019 claim as Mostly False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/495aa314-3469-48b1-9c22-2a846a816891", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05044"}
