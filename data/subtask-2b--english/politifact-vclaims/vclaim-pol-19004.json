They reach in and grab pre-made canvas signs bearing slogans like \"abolish the police\" and \"abolition now.\"\n\"They got shields!\" someone yells.\nThe clip is one of several that circulated on social media following the Sept. 23 news that two Louisville, Ky., police officers involved in the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor would not face charges in connection with her death. Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman, was shot six times in her home as police tried to issue a warrant in March.\nProtesters took to the streets almost immediately after the grand jury announced its decision not to charge the officers with Taylor\u2019s death.\u00a0\nTwo officers were shot and wounded in the ensuing violent demonstrations, and 127 people were arrested. Which leads us back to the video, which was filmed Sept. 23 near downtown Louisville.\u00a0\nSome onlookers claimed the clip showed activists linked to a billionaire philanthropist.\n\"The #ANTIFA UHAUL seen distributing shields, weapons & black bloc is registered to Holly Zoller of the Louisville KY Bail Project which is a George Soros funded initiative,\" a Sept. 23 Facebook\u00a0post says.\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\n\n(Screenshot from Facebook)\nSimilar versions of the post have been shared thousands of times, and \"U-Haul\" trended on Twitter the morning of Sept. 24. Fox News hosts amplified the claim on Twitter, TV and online, as did conservative outlets like the Gateway Pundit and National File. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy cited the footage in an interview with Fox News, during which he claimed protests against police brutality are \"planned, orchestrated events.\"\nWe wanted to take a closer look at the footage.\nSeveral videos of the same event show protesters taking signs from the back of a U-Haul, some of which bear a symbol associated with antifa, a broad coalition of left-wing activists. Zoller, who rented the truck, has done anti-fascist organizing in the past. But there is no evidence that the truck distributed weapons, or that the truck was connected to Soros.\nNo evidence for weapons at U-Haul truck\u00a0\nThe truck depicted in the viral social media video distributed protest supplies like shields, signs and face masks. Some of the signs bore logos associated with antifa. There is no evidence that the truck contained weapons.\nStoryful, a social media intelligence agency, analyzed the video and reported Sept. 23 that it shows protesters unloading shields from a storage truck. That analysis is consistent with reports from journalists on the ground in Louisville.\n\"A parked U-Haul was waiting for the crowd up the street,\" tweeted Shelby Talcott, a reporter for the Daily Caller, from Louisville on Sept. 23. \"It contains supplies such as signs, shields, water etc. I\u2019m not sure how people knew what it contained.\"\n\nIn the footage, one sign taken from the U-Haul shows three arrows pointing down. That\u2019s the symbol of the Iron Front, a German paramilitary organization that formed in the 1930s to oppose extremists on the left and the right, such as the Nazi Party and the Communist Party of Germany.\nInterestingly, the Communist Party of Germany is the source of the term \"antifa.\"\u00a0It adopted the phrase \"Antifaschistische Aktion\" \u2014 \"anti-fascist action,\" in English \u2014 in 1932 as the Nazis were gaining power. So, historically speaking, the Iron Front would have opposed anti-fascist groups and vice versa.\nBut today, American antifa activists have been known to brandish shields, flags and other paraphernalia emblazoned with the Iron Front symbol at protests across the country. Another angle of the protest in Louisville shows the banner head-on, alongside another sign bearing the anarchy symbol.\nDoes that mean the U-Haul was driven by antifa organizers, or that it handed out weapons? Not necessarily.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I haven\u2019t seen any evidence for that specifically,\" said Brendan Gutenschwager, who shot the footage analyzed by Storyful, when asked about the claims in the Facebook post. \"Mostly just the wooden boards and signs handed out of there, some masks as well.\"\nRELATED:\u00a0What is antifa, and why is it all over my timeline?\nSince the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody in May, we\u2019ve fact-checked several claims about alleged antifa involvement in protests against police brutality. Time and again, we have found no evidence to support the notion that a loose coalition of activists is orchestrating violence.\u00a0\n\"We look at antifa as more of an ideology or a movement than an organization,\" FBI Director Christopher Wray said during a House committee hearing Sept. 17.\nWe reached out to the Louisville Metro Police Department and the FBI\u2019s Louisville field office for more information. LMPD didn\u2019t get back to us and the FBI declined to comment.\nSoros isn\u2019t connected to U-Haul\nFor years, Soros has been falsely accused of funding and directing protests. This time is no different.\nThe Facebook post cites \"research by @inteldotwav,\" a 15-month-old Twitter account that posts about \"protests, riots, and chaos.\" It tweeted Sept. 23 that the U-Haul was rented by someone named Holly Zoller.\nZoller is a bail disruptor for the Bail Project\u2019s branch in Louisville whose bio says she \"has organized around anti-fascist movements\" in the past. The Bail Project is a national nonprofit organization that pays people\u2019s bail \"to prevent incarceration and combat racial and economic disparities in the bail system.\"\nSeveral social media posts and the National File story pointed to the fact that some of the Bail Project\u2019s employees were previously Soros Justice Fellows as evidence that the organization is tied to the billionaire philanthropist.\u00a0\nWe asked Storyful whether it had seen any evidence that Soros, whose Open Society Foundations fund many liberal advocacy groups \u2014\u00a0including those that are part of the Black Lives Matter movement \u2014 are connected to the U-Haul. It hadn\u2019t.\u00a0\nThe connection between Zoller and the U-Haul may have started on 4chan, where a user claimed to be able to look up rental information in the company's records. Similar claims spread on Twitter and Discord.\u00a0\nRELATED:\u00a0No, George Soros is not a Nazi who funds antifa\n4chan and Discord are fringe internet platforms where anonymous users are known to create and spread false information. One user, @inteldotwav, claimed to have evidence in the form of\u00a0 a phone call that a group on Discord purportedly had with Zoller, during which she said she drove the U-Haul truck and dropped off supplies at the protest.\nWe could not confirm the date of that call, nor whether the person on it was actually Zoller. But the Bail Project confirmed that Zoller rented the U-Haul truck depicted in the footage.\n\"Holly rented the truck in her personal capacity, during her time off, and did not use funds from The Bail Project,\" said Camilo Ramirez, director of communications for the Bail Project. \"I watched the video and saw painted signs and water, but of course some people are exploiting the clip to create misinformation and attack our organization.\"\nOpen Society Foundations does not fund the Bail Project.\nThe nonprofit\u2019s most recent tax filing shows that it received nearly $25 million in contributions and grants during the fiscal year ending June 2018. None of that money came from the Open Society Foundations, according to the philanthropy\u2019s most recent tax filing and a list of its awarded grants.\n\"The Open Society Foundations supports the First Amendment right of every American to petition their government for redress of grievances through peaceful protest,\" said Laura Silber, the philanthropy\u2019s chief communications officer. \"We abhor violence of any kind. We do not now nor have we ever funded \u2018antifa.\u2019\"\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post says an antifa-operated U-Haul truck distributed \"shields, weapons & black bloc\" to protesters in Louisville and is linked to \"a George Soros-funded initiative.\"\nA video shows protesters taking shields, signs and other supplies from the back of a U-Haul truck. Some of the signs bear a symbol associated with antifa activists. An eyewitness said he didn\u2019t see any evidence that the truck contained weapons\nThe claim that the U-Haul truck is linked to an organization funded by Soros appears to have originated on forums known for spreading online disinformation. There is no connection between the billionaire philanthropist and the truck.\nThe post contains an element of truth but stretches the facts to make an unproven connection to Soros. We rate it Mostly False.\nUPDATE (Sept. 25, 2020): This fact-check has been updated to include a statement from the Bail Project and more information about Zoller.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19004"}
