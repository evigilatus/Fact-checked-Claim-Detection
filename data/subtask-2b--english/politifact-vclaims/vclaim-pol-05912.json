His campaign prides itself on its small donations.\nSpeaking at the University of Chicago on Sept. 28, Sanders vowed to nominate Supreme Court justices who will overturn Citizens United, the landmark 2010 decision that opened the floodgates for unlimited donations to political fundraising organizations known as super PACs. That same day, Sanders took to Twitter to demonstrate his consistency. \u00a0\n\"Unlike virtually every other campaign, we don't have a super PAC which collects money from billionaires and corporations,\" he tweeted.\nWe wanted to look at which 2016 candidates have a super PAC. Is Sanders really the only candidate out of the 15 Republicans and six Democrats without one?\nA who\u2019s who of outside spending\nWe compiled data from the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan campaign finance research group, and a Washington Post analysis. We found that Sanders\u2019 claim largely checks out, albeit with some caveats.\nSanders and Donald Trump are the only major candidates without an affiliated super PAC, the type that are typically campaign surrogates. But he and Trump both have unaffiliated super PACs backing them. We\u2019ll get to the distinction in just a bit.\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of various super PACs connected to the 2016 candidates.

Though these independent groups are not allowed to donate directly to or coordinate with campaigns, they\u2019ve have found ways to toe the line.\nA few examples: Jeb Bush\u2019s longtime strategist and friend Mike Murphy heads his Right to Rise super PAC, which has advertised on his behalf. \u00a0Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2008 campaign manager Guy Cecil is at the helm of the pro-Clinton Priorities Action USA, while her current campaign manager has met with potential PAC donors. Martin O\u2019Malley\u2019s Generation Forward super PAC, established by his former press secretary, has run attack ads against Sanders. \u00a0\nUnaffiliated super PACs are different. The two pro-Sanders super PACs -- Collective Actions PAC and Billionaires for Bernie -- have no ties to Sanders or his campaign.\nIn fact, Sanders team has asked the unaffiliated super PACs to cut it out. Sanders\u2019 lawyers \"have told them to stop,\" said Michael Briggs, communications director for the Sanders campaign, referring to a cease and desist letter sent to one that formed recently. (That group didn\u2019t file with the FEC until mid\u00a0September, but received a $50,000 donation from Daniel Craig, the actor who portrays James Bond.)\nBut because anyone can register a super PAC (this fact-check would be remiss to not mention Stephen Colbert\u2019s Americans for a Better Tomorrow, Tomorrow), candidates can do little to stop one from forming and declaring its support.\nThe distinction between an affiliated super PAC and an unaffiliated one is significant, said Anthony Corrado, a professor who studies campaign finance at Colby College.\n\"Sanders has been clear in disavowing any such efforts and noting that he does not want the support of such groups,\" he said. \"So I do not believe the mere existence of a registered committee renders his point invalid.\"\nAhead of the PACs\nWe should note that Sanders isn\u2019t the only presidential\u00a0candidate without an affiliated super PAC. The same could be said of Democratic rivals former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb (who\u2019s polling at 0.8 percent), former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee (who\u2019s polling at 0 percent) and Harvard professor Lawrence Lessig (who doesn\u2019t appear in the polls at all and who, before declaring his candidacy, famously started a super PAC dedicated to ending all super PACs).\nBut among the more prominent candidates, Sanders is indeed the odd man out.\nTexas Sen. Ted Cruz has more affiliated super PACs than anyone else (four), while Bush\u2019s Right to Rise has raised the most money by far: more than $103 million. In Sanders\u2019 own party, the pro-Clinton Priorities USA Action has raised $15.6 million.\nDonald Trump, who repeatedly touts his financial independence from donors, seems to be friendly with a super PAC created in his honor. While Trump\u2019s not coordinating with the group on the same level as Bush or Clinton, the connections are certainly stronger than Sanders\u2019 with his backers and \"worth noting,\" said McGuire.\nThe billionaire attended a New York fundraiser hosted by the Make America Great Again PAC in July and said he\u2019s grateful for their support, reports Politico. The group also received a $100,000 donation from the in-laws of Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka, according to Politico.\nOur ruling\nSanders tweeted, \"Unlike virtually every other campaign, we don't have a Super PAC which collects money from billionaires and corporations.\"\nOut of the 21 presidential candidates, Sanders is one of five who doesn\u2019t have an affiliated super PAC. Sanders\u2019 qualifier -- \"virtually\" -- makes his claim more accurate.\nIf we narrow the count to major candidates, only Sanders and Trump can claim that, but both have two unaffiliated super PACs backing their candidacy. Trump has appeared at a fundraiser for one super PAC that\u2019s also received donations from his in-laws. Sanders, meanwhile, has disassociated himself with these groups, through statements and legal action.\nWe rate Sanders\u2019 claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05912"}
