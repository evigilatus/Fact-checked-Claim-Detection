Minneapolis is a liberal bastion in a blue state.\nTrump tweeted a response targeting Frey and U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Minneapolis Democrat whom he has attacked before.\n\"The lightweight mayor is hurting the great police and other wonderful supporters. 72,000 ticket requests already.

These estimated additional expenses total $530,000.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe letter states it is the licensee\u2019s responsibility \"to coordinate through the Secret Service and pay for any law enforcement services necessary for the event.\"\nThe letter states that if these arrangements are not confirmed by 8 a.m. Oct. 8, then the agreement will be terminated \"for breach of the Event Security provision.\"\u00a0\nThe campaign wrote in a letter to AEG that the campaign and AEG are not required to pay for security and threatened to sue. (We have not seen a copy of the agreement.)\nCasper Hill, a city spokesman, told PolitiFact that the public safety costs are expected to be around $400,000 and there are an additional $130,000 costs for lane closure fees and traffic control, among other things. The city examined the costs for other major recent events to determine the costs, including the Super Bowl in 2018, which was roughly $6 million, and $1.5 million for the Final Four men\u2019s college basketball tournament earlier this year.\u00a0\nMinneapolis City Attorney Susan Segal told the Star Tribune that \"it\u2019s not fair\" for residents to shoulder the costs. Segal told the Star Tribune that the city has been having conversations with organizations including the Twins, the Vikings and the Minnesota Ballpark Authority about sharing costs of events. Those discussions started before the Super Bowl in 2018, she said.\u00a0\nMinneapolis\u2019 estimate, however, appears far higher than what it cost other cities to host Trump rallies. The Star Tribune reported that Trump\u2019s rally in Rochester in 2018 cost the city government $76,138 while a rally in Duluth cost the city more than $69,000.\nA national investigation by the Center for Public Integrity found that among local governments that invoiced the Trump campaign, the amounts ranged between $8,000 to $82,000 for public safety costs related to rallies. The highest bill was from the city of El Paso for about $470,000.\u00a0\nOn the day of the 2009 Obama rally, the Minneapolis police chief estimated the department\u2019s costs to top $20,000 including for 50 officers on overtime at the 20,500-seat Target Center arena, the St. Paul Pioneer Press reported. We tried to confirm if that was the actual cost with police officials but did not get a response.\nIt isn\u2019t unusual for local law enforcement agencies to be asked to swallow security costs, and Trump\u2019s is not the only campaign to do so. The Center for Public Integrity found that Obama\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t always pay for security. Some 2020 Democratic presidential candidates didn't respond to the Center when asked about security bills while others said they will pay or had paid certain bills.\nNo FEC requirement for candidates to pay security\nThere is no specific requirement within the provisions of the Federal Election Campaign Act or Federal Election Commission regulations for congressional or presidential campaign committees to pay for expenses incurred by a state or local government for campaign events, said Myles Martin, an FEC spokesman.\u00a0\nThat means that campaigns can choose to reimburse governments for security costs, but they are not required.\nA Secret Service spokesman told PolitiFact that it is not funded to pay police overtime and doesn\u2019t have a mechanism to do so.\n\"This is a blank spot in campaign finance laws and campaigns often take advantage of it, as the Trump campaign is in Minneapolis this week,\" said Carleton College political science professor Steven Schier. \"It's a low priority for Congress because it does not affect legislators' campaigns in a significant way.\"\nThere is, however, a mechanism for local law enforcement to seek reimbursement for protecting Trump\u2019s residences in Florida, New York and New Jersey.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nThe Trump campaign said that the Minneapolis \"city government preemptively informed the Target Center that it would be responsible for $530,000 in security and other costs\" related to a Trump rally, \"more than 26 times the estimated security costs for a 2009 Target Center health care rally held by President Barack Obama.\"\nA letter from AEG to the Trump campaign cites the $530,000 estimated costs. An article in the St. Paul Pioneer Press paraphrased the Minneapolis police chief at the time stating that the costs would be $20,000 for an Obama rally.\nWe rate this claim True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00084"}
