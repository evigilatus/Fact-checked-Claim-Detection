Bernie Sanders criticized defense spending during the Democratic presidential debate in South Carolina, saying that the out-of-control budget isn\u2019t focused enough on fighting modern threats.\n\"Unfortunately, much of that budget continues to fight the old Cold War with the Soviet Union,\" Sanders said. \"Very little of that budget \u2014 less than 10 percent \u2014 actually goes into fighting ISIS and international terrorism.\"\nThat seems like very little from a budget that tops $600 billion for fiscal year 2016, so we decided to look into it. What we found is that while Sanders was talking primarily about money earmarked for fighting the group known as Islamic State (also known as ISIS or ISIL), he\u2019s not considering the true fungibility of the Defense Department\u2019s budget.\nDeciphering defense\nSanders\u2019 campaign has used this talking point before, and shared the\u00a0math with us. They cited more than $600 billion in defense spending, saying only $5.5 billion has gone to fighting ISIS and around $42 billion has gone to operations in Afghanistan, much of which is used to fight al-Qaida.\nIn all, they said the government has spent about 7.9 percent of the defense budget on fighting terrorism.\nBut experts told us that\u2019s a very narrow view of how the defense budget works, which is the largest of any single country in the world by far.\nFor fiscal year 2016, total defense spending clocked in at almost $607 billion overall in the spending bill Congress passed in December 2015. That includes all defense-related appropriations, including mandatory funding for retirement and pension payments and nuclear weapons spending at the Department of Energy.\nWe\u2019re concerned primarily with two parts of the Defense Department budget: Base discretionary spending and the Overseas Contingency Operations fund.\nBase discretionary funding is the biggest chunk of the budget. That\u2019s all the money the U.S. military gets to buy planes and tanks, fund research, keep bases open and so forth. Laicie Heeley, a fellow with the Budgeting for Foreign Affairs and Defense program at the Washington-based Stimson Center, said the Defense Department\u2019s base for 2016, minus other defense-related spending, is around $522.9 billion. That\u2019s a $26.8 billion increase from last year, she said.\nBut money for fighting wars comes from the so-called Overseas Contingency Operations fund, which was established after the Sept. 11 attacks. It currently includes funding for the air campaign against ISIS, but also maintaining a presence in Iraq and Afghanistan. Initiatives to assist with counterterrorism efforts in the Middle East and NATO allies in Europe concerned about Russian aggression also come out of the OCO.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fund is controversial, because Congress and the White House have squabbled over using the OCO to pay for things normally covered by base funding, in order to get around the effects of sequestration. For 2016, the fund received about $58.8 billion, but the budget deal put about $9.1 billion in the OCO for things normally covered under base funding.\nThat leaves $49.7 billion earmarked for waging war abroad, but the details of how that money is used is a bit murky in the appropriations bill. A clear picture won\u2019t be available until the Defense Department releases its 2017 budget request in February.\nIn the meantime, Heeley said, we can use President Barack Obama\u2019s 2016 defense budget request to get an idea of how the money is allotted. Obama asked Congress for $5.3 billion to fight ISIS (slated to grow in 2017) and $42.5 billion for Afghanistan, largely to help fight al-Qaida.\nUsing these figures with the Sanders campaign\u2019s rough math, ignoring the military presence in Iraq or other counterterrorism operations, that would be a bit more than 9 percent.\nBut here\u2019s the thing: Policy experts said it\u2019s hard to draw a tidy line between how much of the defense budget is for current operations and how much is for general readiness. The military needs its base budget in order to conduct the fighting for which the OCO was created.\n\"Capital investments in ships and planes are not included in OCO, yet you need them to launch Tomahawks and all other sorts of munitions,\" said Janine Davidson, senior fellow for defense policy at the Council on Foreign Relations. \"Personnel and training also are not easy to parse. A C-17 could fly a mission around the world and only part of the week would be in support of (an) Afghanistan or ISIS fight.\"\nSanders\u2019 math also doesn\u2019t take into account counterterrorism efforts through other sources that don\u2019t involve bombs or fighter jets, like the Justice or State departments.\nFor example, the FBI\u2019s Counterterrorism/Counterintelligence Decision Unit spent about $3.3 billion in 2015, and asked for about the same amount in 2016. The CIA and the National Security Agency also work to thwart terrorism. While we don\u2019t know to what degree those agencies are funded, documents leaked by NSA contractor Edward Snowden showed that in 2013, more than $16 billion was spent to combat terrorism.\n\"Bernie is taking an extremely limited view of the defense budget here,\" Heeley said. \"While it may be true that the counterterrorism budget as a whole deserves a closer look, and would benefit from more transparency, it is not true that we're spending significantly less than 10 percent overall to fight international terrorism.\"\nOur ruling\nSanders said, \"Very little of (the defense) budget \u2014 less than 10 percent \u2014 actually goes into fighting ISIS and international terrorism.\"\nHe\u2019s getting that number by using a very limited view of the overall defense budget, pointing only to specific allotments in the budget for addressing ISIS and other terrorist threats. Experts told us that no matter what amounts are designated for that purpose, those operations draw from resources paid for in the base budget. There\u2019s no clear way to separate the two.\nSanders\u2019 figure does refer to some specific funding but paints a misleading picture of overall defense spending. We rate it Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05534"}
