Thousands of individuals have been identified who appear to have violated the law by casting ballots after they moved from NV.\"\n\"In Nevada, there appear to be thousands of individuals who improperly cast mail ballots,\" Matt Morgan, general counsel for Trump\u2019s reelection campaign, similarly said in a statement Nov. 6.\nPolitiFact reached out to Trump\u2019s campaign, a law office representing the campaign, and to the Nevada Republican Party seeking information. We did not hear back.\nAt this point, the claims are unproven.\nLawsuit filed against against officials in Nevada, letter sent to Justice Department\nA lawsuit filed Nov. 5 against Nevada\u2019s secretary of state and the Clark County registrar of voters alleges that \"irregularities have plagued the election in Clark County.\" Clark County is Nevada\u2019s most populous county, is home to Las Vegas and has the state\u2019s highest number of registered Democrats.\nThe lawsuit claims that there were \"over 3,000 instances of ineligible individuals casting ballots,\" and that ballots were cast on behalf of deceased voters. It does not include evidence to back those claims. The lawsuit, which challenges the county\u2019s use of a machine as a step in signature verification, was filed on behalf of a Nevada resident, candidate committees for two Republicans running for Congress, and another person identified as a credentialed member of the media.\n\"We are not aware of any improper ballots that are being processed,\" Clark County Registrar of Voters Joe Gloria said during a press conference Nov. 5.\nLawyers for Trump\u2019s campaign sent a letter to Clark County\u2019s counsel, saying, \"We have confirmed that thousands of votes have been cast improperly. Indeed, we have initially identified 3,062 voters who moved from Nevada before the election but still cast ballots in this election.\" The lawyers said they cross-referenced the list of general election voters with publicly available change of address records. The attorneys sent a similar letter to Barr, the U.S. attorney general.\nHowever, a mismatch in those records doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that a vote was cast illegally. The ACLU of Nevada said that an American who moved within 30 days before an election has a right to vote in a presidential race in their new state of residence, or may cast a ballot in their previous state of residence, in-person or via absentee ballot. A spokesperson for Nevada Secretary of State Barbara K. Cegavske, a Republican, told PolitiFact that the ACLU statement is accurate and also applies to Nevada.\nTrump\u2019s lawyers produced a list of voters who allegedly voted improperly. But Jon Ralston, editor of The Nevada Independent, a nonprofit news organization, noted in a Nov. 6 tweet that the list includes Nevadans in the military who voted absentee. \"Many on list sent to the DOJ have these postal codes: AE, AA and AP: Armed Forces Europe, Armed Forces Americas and Armed Forces Pacific,\" Ralston said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe list does not include voters\u2019 names, but does show other identifying information. It includes the city, state, and zip code where one voter moved from, and the city, state, and zip code where the voter moved.\nFor instance, the first page of the list says that \"vote cast record 28\" moved from Las Vegas, Nev., and lists as the new city \"FPO\" and as the new state \"AE.\"\nThe Defense Department says that \"FPO\" stands for Fleet Post Office, and is associated with Navy installations and ships. The U.S. Postal Service says that \"AE\" should be used as the \"state\" abbreviation for Armed Forces in Europe.\nNevadans who go to college out-of-state and other people who leave the state temporarily can also get a ballot at a new address.\nSo the list produced by Trump\u2019s lawyers on its own does not prove whether the identified people cast a vote illegally.\nOur ruling\nNevada Republicans said they found \"at least 3,062 instances of voter fraud. ... Thousands of individuals have been identified who appear to have violated the law by casting ballots after they moved from NV.\"\nThe GOP lawyers issued a list that they say shows more than 3,000 people who were no longer living in Clark County by the time they cast their ballots. The list alone does not prove a violation of the law.\nPeople who move within 30 days before an election can cast a vote in their new state, or in their prior state of residence, in-person or via absentee ballot. A Nevadan who goes to another state for college can also request a ballot. The list from Trump\u2019s lawyers also included addresses for Americans serving overseas in the military.\nThe burden of proof is on the speaker making the claim. The information released so far by Trump\u2019s team does not confirm their claim.\nWe rate the claim False.\nRELATED: Donald Trump\u2019s Pants on Fire claim about illegal votes\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click here, for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18483"}
