Farm bills are passed about every five years, reauthorizing food and agriculture policy including measures such as crop and commodity subsidies, conservation programs, agriculture research and food assistance benefits, known as SNAP for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.\nThe bill mentioned illegal immigrants briefly, in Section 4015, to mandate that states would be \"required to use an immigration status verification system\" when distributing food assistance benefits.\nDeSantis voted against the bill, which passed 251-166. He also voted against a predecessor of the bill which failed to pass through the House, but had a similar provision against immigrants in the country illegally obtaining food assistance benefits.\nPutnam and his supporters frequently cite these votes as evidence that DeSantis was in favor of extending SNAP to people in the country illegally.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe thinking goes that by voting against the farm bill in total, DeSantis voted against a provision that sought to verify that food assistance benefits only went to U.S. citizens.\nAs a result, Putnam and his supporters claim, DeSantis supported distributing food assistance benefits without a citizenship test. And therefore, he supported distributing food assistance benefits to people in the country illegally.\nIn April, seven radio stations have pulled a radio ad from the National Liberty Federation making the same claim as Putnam made during the Fox News debate, according to the DeSantis campaign.\nEven if H.R. 2642 had been voted down, SNAP regulations already in place prohibited people living in the United States illegally from receiving benefits.\nNune Phillips, a policy analyst at the Center for Law and Social Policy, told PolitiFact in March 2018, \"Undocumented immigrants are not currently, and never have been, eligible for SNAP. To qualify for SNAP, applicants must be U.S. citizens or be eligible, lawfully-present noncitizens.\"\nAfter the vote in 2014, DeSantis wrote a Facebook post clarifying his reasoning: he voted against the bill because of the high cost and low return. The bill, he wrote, is a \"bad deal for taxpayers and contains little in the way of meaningful reforms.\"\nSpecifically, he was concerned that the bill did not do enough to cut back the rising cost of food stamp program\u2014a far cry from wanting to expand it to include illegal immigrants.\nWhen asked about the claim, Putnam campaign spokesperson Meredith Beatrice directed us toward DeSantis\u2019s voting record on the 2014 bill and its predecessor, as well as a link to this similarly misleading Central Florida Post article.\nOur ruling\nPutnam claimed DeSantis \"voted in an agricultural bill to give food stamps to illegal immigrants.\" DeSantis actually voted against the bill, and explained later it had nothing to do with provisions related to immigration.\nPutnam has cast the vote against the farm bill as somehow allowing people living in the country illegally to receive food assistance benefits.\nBut the practice was prohibited before the 2014 vote, and it remained prohibited after the 2014 vote.\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire!\n Share the Facts 2018-06-29 18:17:43 UTC   PolitiFact    1 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Pants on Fire  Says Ron DeSantis \"voted in an agricultural bill to give food stamps to illegal immigrants.\"    Adam Putnam Agriculture Commissioner https://video.foxnews.com/v/5803306741001/   in a Fox News Debate Thursday, June 28, 2018 2018-06-28    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01910"}
