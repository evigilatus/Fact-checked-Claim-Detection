Nearly half your paycheck! Forget feeding your family after you\u2019ve paid all your bills. Are you really okay with this?\"\nThe post is inaccurate and the latest mischaracterization by conservatives and social media users of Biden\u2019s tax plan. It was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nIn reality, a single worker making $3,000 every two weeks \u2014 or $78,000 annually \u2014 would not be paying 39.6% in federal income taxes under a Biden presidency.\u00a0\nBiden\u2019s tax plan\nThe Facebook post includes a photo of a Fox Business Network segment on Sen. Kamala Harris, Biden\u2019s running mate. The segment listed the tax ideas Harris pitched while running for president herself, including a proposal to raise the top individual federal income tax rate, which Biden has also made. It\u2019s not clear when the segment aired.\u00a0\nBut Harris didn\u2019t propose such giant tax rate increases for lower earners as a candidate, and neither has Biden. Biden has vowed not to raise taxes for those earning less than $400,000 per year.\u00a0\nHis plan aims to raise up to $4 trillion in tax revenues over a decade, according to the Tax Policy Center, in part by rolling back some of the tax cuts for corporations and people with taxable incomes over $400,000 that President Donald Trump signed into law in 2017.\nAmong Biden\u2019s proposed changes, he would:\n\n\nIncrease the top corporate tax rate to 28% from 21%.\n\n\nRaise the top individual federal income tax rate to 39.6% from 37%.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlace a 12.4% Social Security tax on incomes above $400,000.\n\n\nTax capital gains at the same rate as ordinary income for very high earners.\n\n\nUnder current law, the top marginal federal income tax rate is 37%, which kicks in for income above $518,400 for individuals, according to the Internal Revenue Service. A 22% marginal tax rate currently applies to single filers for income over $40,125 and under $85,525.\nSeveral independent tax groups that have examined Biden\u2019s tax proposals have estimated that after-tax income for some lower earners could slightly decrease. But those changes would not be the result of direct increases to their tax rates.\nInstead, tax analysts say the changes in after-tax income for lower earners would be mostly due to indirect effects on Biden\u2019s raising of the corporate tax rate, such as lowered wages.\n\"No direct taxes are imposed on any household making less than $400,000 per year,\" the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget wrote in its analysis.\nOne March analysis from the Tax Policy Center predicted that on average, the bottom 80% of earners could wind up paying between $30 and $590 extra annually on Biden\u2019s watch. The report estimated that over 90% of the tax increases would be borne by the top 20% of earners.\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post said Biden and Harris would raise the federal income tax rate for a person with a bi-weekly gross salary of $3,000 to 39.6%, costing \"nearly half your paycheck.\"\nThat\u2019s wrong. The 39.6% rate is what Biden proposed for earners in the top income tax bracket, which the IRS says includes individual single taxpayers making more than $518,400 per year.\u00a0\nWe rate this Facebook post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17180"}
