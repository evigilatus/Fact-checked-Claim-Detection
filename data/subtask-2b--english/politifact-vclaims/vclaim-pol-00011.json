Tony Evers has called a special session of the state Legislature. He wanted lawmakers to take up a so-called \"red flag\" law \u2014 which would allow judges to take guns away from people who are deemed to be a danger \u2014 and an expansion of gun background checks to include sales between private parties.\nSenate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald promptly announced he would likely adjourn the session as soon as it began, refusing to even vote on the proposals.\nMeanwhile, the state Legislature\u2019s other lead Republican \u2014 Assembly Speaker Robin Vos \u2014 has been making the media rounds to defend Republican inaction and condemn Evers\u2019 proposals.\nThat included a Facebook Live interview with WTJM-TV\u2019s Charles Benson on Oct. 22, 2019. Their conversation turned to red flag laws, also referred to as emergency risk protection orders. Here\u2019s part of that exchange:\nVos \u2014 Red flags laws, it\u2019s basically like saying we are going to take away your car because we think you could drive drunk. It\u2019s crazy.\nBenson \u2014 But a judge has to decide that.\nVos \u2014 No, they take away your weapon first, then you have to go and ask permission to get the weapon back.\nVos later reiterated his description while criticizing how the Marquette University Law School poll summarized red flag laws as \"allowing the police to take guns away from people who have been found by a judge to be a danger to themselves or others.\" In late August, the poll showed 81% of respondents in support.\n\"That\u2019s not the way the red flag law works,\" said Vos, R-Rochester. \"They take it away first. Then you have to get permission from a judge to do it.\"\nIs Vos right that red flag laws allow guns to be seized before a judge gets involved?\nLet\u2019s dig in.\nThe background\nRed flag laws provide a mechanism to take guns from people exhibiting dangerous behavior before they harm themselves or others.\nThe first such law was passed in Connecticut in 1990, but the second didn\u2019t appear until Indiana\u2019s in 2005. More states have adopted such laws in recent years in the wake of mass shootings by people who had exhibited earlier warning signs.\nAt least 17 states and the District of Columbia now have a red flag law, including several passed in 2019, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a research and advocacy organization. Every state allows law enforcement to seek the removal of guns, 12\u00a0 allow family or household members to as well, and a smattering of states also allow petitions from medical professionals, co-workers or school officials.\n\nTypically, a judge (or other judicial official such as a court commissioner) hears the request and then decides whether to issue a preliminary order without holding a hearing or notifying the gun owner. These orders are temporary and last from two to 21 days depending on the state, according to an issue brief put together by the nonpartisan Wisconsin Legislative Council. The gun owner then has a chance to make his or her case at a hearing before a judge decides on a final order. That order commonly lasts for a year.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent states have different burdens of proof that must be met for a judge to issue an order, such as finding the individual poses a \"significant risk\" or that there is \"clear and convincing evidence.\"\nIf an order is issued, some states require guns be turned over immediately, while others allow a short period of time. A search warrant authorizing seizure can also be issued in some states.\nEvers\u2019 proposed red flag law for Wisconsin requires a hearing within 14 days of the preliminary order, and makes a final order valid for a year. It says guns should be seized if the judge finds \"reasonable grounds that the respondent is substantially likely\" to harm themselves or others. Requests can be made to either extend the final order or end it early.\nState law already requires guns be surrendered as a result of other judicial findings, such as mental health commitments and restraining orders, according to the Legislative Council.\nVos\u2019\u00a0defense\nYou may have noticed the word \"judge\" appeared frequently in the summary above.\nThe Wisconsin proposal \u2014 contrary to Vos\u2019\u00a0description \u2014 doesn\u2019t allow any guns to be seized without a judicial order.\nAsked for evidence that judges aren\u2019t initially involved in red flag law seizures, Vos spokeswoman Kit Beyer said Vos misheard the question.\n\"Speaker Vos thought Charles Benson had asked if the accused goes before a judge prior to an order to surrender,\" Beyer said.\nBut that explanation doesn\u2019t strike us as reasonable.\nBenson\u2019s initial question about the red flag law was far less specific \u2013 asking if Vos thinks Wisconsin residents want to see it passed. And Vos\u2019\u00a0second reference to a lack of judicial sign-off came after Benson simply read the wording of the Marquette poll.\nDescriptions of red flag laws consistently refer to decisions being made by judges. That\u2019s the terminology used by Giffords, the Legislative Council, the National Conference of State Legislatures, the New York Times and many others.\nBut there is an exception.\nIndiana\u2019s law allows police to seize firearms without first obtaining a judicial order. However, they must then submit a statement to a judge, who can overturn the officer\u2019s decision and refuse to issue a preliminary order, according to Giffords. Similar to other states, that preliminary order requires a hearing on a final order be held within 14 days.\nBeyer said Vos\u2019\u00a0primary concern with the red flag laws relates to due process, since the preliminary order can be issued without the individual having a chance to dispute it. That is a core objection from other conservatives and groups that oppose red flag laws as well, including the National Rifle Association.\nRed flag laws have been challenged in other states, but courts have upheld them as constitutional on both Second Amendment and due process grounds, the Legislative Council said. That includes a ruling upholding the Florida law in September 2019.\nOur ruling\nVos said red flag laws mean \"they take it away first. Then you have to get permission from a judge to do it.\"\nBut red flag laws \u2014 including the one proposed in Wisconsin \u2014 don\u2019t typically work like that. They involve police or family petitioning a judge, who must sign a preliminary order before any guns can be seized.\nIndiana does have a law set up as Vos describes, but even there the seizure decision by police is subject to immediate judicial review. And that\u2019s the exception, not the rule.\nWe rate Vos\u2019\u00a0claim Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00011"}
