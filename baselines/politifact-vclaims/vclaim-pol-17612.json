(A \"SCIF,\" which stands for \"sensitive compartmented information facility,\" is a secure government facility where classified intelligence can be discussed without eavesdropping.)\nCipollone\u2019s assertion echoed one made by, and on behalf of, a group of Republicans who staged a sit-in at the House Intelligence committee, to protest what they argued were unfair ground rules for the Republican minority during the House impeachment inquiry.\nOn Oct. 23, more than 40 Republican lawmakers disrupted witness testimony by storming the SCIF where depositions were under way, chanting, \"Let us in!\"\u00a0\nAt the time of the sit-in, Republicans could argue that that the impeachment hearings had only taken place behind closed doors and without transcripts being formally released. (Those transcripts were later released to the public, minus redactions for national-security reasons.)\nBut what about access to the depositions at the Intelligence Committee? Were all Republicans banned? No.\u00a0\nIn the recent impeachment, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., instructed three House committees \u2014 Oversight, Intelligence and Foreign Affairs \u2014 to carry out an investigation that the House Judiciary Committee eventually used to draft articles of impeachment. All three committees and all of their members had access to depositions in the SCIF.\u00a0\nThere are nine Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee, 17 on the House Oversight Committee, and 21 on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJake Tapper\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in remarks in a CNN broadcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second presidential impeachment of Donald Trump was \u201cthe most bipartisan impeachment in American history.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll 47 of those Republicans have been able to participate and ask questions in the interviews and depositions held to this point, Ashley Etienne, Pelosi\u2019s communications director, told PolitiFact last October. Independent experts told us the same thing.\nSome Republican House members, such as Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, who organized the Oct. 23 protest, were kept out of the hearings not because of their party affiliation, but because they did not sit not on the relevant committees. (Democrats who weren\u2019t on the committees were kept out as well.) Some, such as Rep. Ted Yoho of Florida, chose not to attend despite being able to do so.\nThe proof is also in the transcripts that were publicly released: Republican lawmakers and staff asked questions of witnesses, with the witness responding under oath.\nOne analysis by Philip Bump of the Washington Post found that Republican lawmakers made extensive use of their questioning powers in the deposition of Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a member of the National Security Council. He did this by tallying up the number of lines devoted to each party\u2019s remarks in the transcript that was eventually released.\n\"About 44% of the transcript is made up of questions or answers from Democratic members or staff,\" Bump wrote. \"About 41% is from the Republicans. The remaining 15% was discussion and objections.\"\nNeither the White House nor Trump\u2019s 2020 re-election campaign replied to our query asking for evidence that backed Cipollone\u2019s claim.\nOur ruling\nCipollone said, \"Not even Schiff\u2019s Republican colleagues were allowed into the SCIF\" during the House impeachment investigation.\nNot only were they allowed in, but there\u2019s voluminous evidence in the deposition transcripts that they asked questions extensively and received answers under oath.\u00a0\nWe rate the statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17612"}
