Daley didn't support the idea, he just said it was worth exploring. However, Mendoza explained it on BBC News Radio. \"Every city has a passenger tax - look at Detroit, Philadelphia - it's actually stagnating in terms of its economy. Mendoza said he was a labour killer. \"This is just, once again, a return to an easy well that pimps to an audience who doesn't understand the real consequences of what these policies will do bad-faced.\" Our attention has been drawn to the comprehensive nature of her statement. Have mobile taxes already moved the long-term desperate to hurt the economies of each city? 101. It should be noted in advance that the term 'computer tax &apos; is a misleading acronym for a range of revenue collection schemes that affect not only those who travel to work from outside the city, but also the city &apos; s inhabitants. \"The only thing that this term expresses is that non-residents also pay taxes,\" said Richard Oxer, an assistant researcher with the Centre for Tax Policy for Urban Brokers. Chicago once had what may be referred to loosely as the passenger tax, the so-called head tax, which imposes a monthly charge on larger employers of $4 per worker. The fees were charged regardless of whether the worker lived in Chicago or abroad. Mayor Ram Emmanuel launched a campaign in 2011 to get rid of the head tax, which was eventually phased out. Other cities tax travellers as supplements to local income taxes, while suburban residents who work in the city sometimes pay the same rate as urban residents and sometimes receive a discount. This scheme is impossible in Chicago because the state does not allow cities and provinces to tax income. It is not every central city in Mendoza's argument that mobile taxes are always counterproductive. When we approached her campaign, the speaker, Rebecca Evans, referred to the report of the Inspector General of Chicago for 2011, which indicated that large cities that tax passengers such as Detroit, Cleveland and Philadelphia also had stagnant economies. Evans also referred to studies on the passenger tax in Philadelphia, which blames her for contributing significantly to the loss of jobs there. However, the experts with whom we spoke said that blaming the economic plight of those troubled cities for passenger taxes alone was crucial. Referring to the decline in Detroit and Cleveland, Oxer said that the passenger tax was probably only one factor among the larger trends in manufacturing and population sweeping the Rust Belt. In 2017, under the Tax Act 2017, \"taxes will be raised on people who receive less than $75,000 in 2021 and every two years thereafter until 2027.\" According to Louis Jacobson on February 5, 2021, the tax could have already worsened by helping to push companies and residents out of the city. \"But the traveller's tax is often a reaction to some of these other cases, the biggest ones that happen,\" he said. For example, Philadelphia's passenger tax was implemented in 1939, where the city sought to avoid bankruptcy in the aftermath of the Great Depression. Evans told us that Mendoza does not claim that in every city a passenger tax is the only source of economic difficulties. However, it is related to the claim of its candidate that cities that levy such taxes are all experiencing economic problems. The problem with this comprehensive circular is that some American cities that tax passengers are flourishing. For example, Denver is often commended for its prosperous economy, although since 1988 it has operated under a monthly division of the head of labour tax of $9.75 between employers and employees. According to census data, the employment rate in Denver has risen by more than 60 per cent since 1990. The unemployment rate is currently 3.3 per cent, below the national average. Furthermore, the average weekly wage in the Metro Denver region, which includes Denver and the nearby Aurora suburb, with a similar head tax, ranked eighth in the State in 2017. Denver added nearly 3,000 new companies between 2007 and 2016. Louisville, Kentucky, Columbus, Ohio, other large cities, financially healthy and taxing travellers. \"I think you should always be careful with these taxes, and there's a good reason not to make this your first choice,\" said Okser. \"But there are many successful cities that have these taxes.\" Our judgment, Mendoza, said that every city taxed a traveler who stumbled economically under a tax that caused job killings. Mendoza is not mistaken in pointing out that passenger taxes carry the risk of discouraging business activity and employment in a city, and have proved to do so in selected cases such as the Philadelphia case. But it didn't stop there. Instead, she said that since the performance of some cities imposing taxes on travellers remained economically weak, all cities imposing such taxes must also be poorly performing. This is simply not the case. We assess her claim mostly wrong. In fact, this statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that give a different impression.
