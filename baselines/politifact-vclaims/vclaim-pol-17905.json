(Read more about our partnership with Facebook).\nDid Clinton really raise a Bible in front of the same church, and is the implied similarity between the two images reasonable?\nNot the same in any way\nThe short answer to both questions is no.\nThe photo of Clinton was taken July 9, 2000, by Manny Ceneta and distributed by Getty Images.\nThe caption says it shows Clinton waving his Bible \"following a church service at Foundry United Methodist Church.\" Clinton worshipped there \"most Sundays when he\u2019s in town,\" according to a 1998 Washington Post article.\nSo it\u2019s not the same church.\nAnd the post\u2019s underlying implication about the similarity of the two situations is just as off base.\nClinton was pictured carrying his Bible after attending a church service at his church.\nTrump\u2019s circumstances were \u2026 different.\nTrump has attended the church a few times, but he\u2019s hardly a regular. The Post reports he attended a service before his swearing-in ceremony in 2017 \u2014 following a tradition dating back to President Franklin D. Roosevelt \u2014 as well as one other time in 2017 and once in 2019.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe church was boarded up at the time of Trump\u2019s June 1 visit, after a fire was set in the basement amid the protests over the death of George Floyd while in the custody of Minneapolis police. It hadn\u2019t hosted services since mid-March due to the coronavirus restrictions.\nCritics have noted the moment\u2019s stark contrast to what preceded it.\nBefore going to St. John\u2019s, Trump had delivered a Rose Garden address where he called himself an \"ally of peaceful protesters\" but also invoked strong military language. He condemned protest violence as \"domestic terror,\" urged governors to deploy National Guard to \"dominate the streets\" and promised to deploy the military to \"quickly solve the problems for them\" if state and local officials didn\u2019t take action.\nTrump closed by saying, \"now I\u2019m going to pay my respects to a very, very special place.\"\nTrump didn\u2019t say much during the stop, where he posed alone and with a group of aides, holding a Bible handed to him by his daughter, Ivanka Trump. When a reporter asked if the Bible was his, Trump responded, \"It\u2019s a Bible.\" When asked more generally for his thoughts, Trump talked about America being a \"great country.\"\nAnd the entire photo op occurred without the permission or involvement of the church, which later condemned the visit.\nTrump did not inform church leadership he was coming. No one associated with the church was present. He did not enter the building. He did not quote any Scripture. He did not pray.\nRev. Mariann Budde, who oversees the church\u2019s denomination in Washington, D.C., said she was \"outraged\" to see the resulting images.\n\"I am the bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington and was not given even a courtesy call, that they would be clearing (the area) with tear gas so they could use one of our churches as a prop,\" Budde told the Washington Post.\nBudde is referring to what preceded the four-minute walk Trump and his entourage took to reach the church. That\u2019s a key reason USA TODAY noted this \"may become a defining event of Trump's presidency.\"\nTo clear a path to St. John\u2019s, police had forcibly removed White House demonstrators the New York Times described as a \"generally peaceful crowd.\"\nThe nature of that removal remains a topic of debate: Park Police told USA TODAY they did not use tear gas (as many media outlets reported) but did use pepper balls, a chemical irritant. The White House and Park Police said rubber bullets were not used.\nOur ruling\nA viral Facebook post claimed \"It wasn't a big deal when Bill Clinton held up the Bible in front of the same exact church (as Donald Trump).\"\nThe image of Clinton in the post is not from the same church.\u00a0\nAnd attempting to draw a parallel between the two incidents is a big stretch. Clinton was holding his Bible as he left a service he attended. Trump was manufacturing a photo op that had no other religious content and occurred without the church\u2019s involvement, which was preceded by police forcibly removing protesters to clear a path.\nWe rate this claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17905"}
