David Cicilline was a liar and had committed voter fraud -- charges that Cicilline strenuously denied -- challenger Anthony Gemma claimed that the first-term congressman\u2019s \u00a0\"number one lie\" pertained to the condition of Providence\u2019s schools while Cicilline was mayor.\n\nDuring their first television debate in the 2012 primary race, broadcast on WPRI-Channel 12, Gemma said Cicilline had described the capital city\u2019s school system during his eight years as mayor in glowing terms when that was far from the truth.\n\n\"When Mr. Cicilline was mayor of Providence -- we\u2019re going to stumble on the number one lie of Mr. Cicilline during his tenure as mayor --what he said is that the City of Providence during his eight years had a world-class -- and he used the word world-class -- school system. And not only did Providence not have a world-class school system but, as measured, was amongst the last school system [sic] in the entire country.\"\n\nWe knew that the city\u2019s schools -- like those in many urban centers -- have problems and are among the most troubled in Rhode Island. But we wondered whether they are among the worst in the entire country.\n\nWe called the Gemma campaign to get the candidate\u2019s supporting evidence and, while we waited for a response, started doing our own research.\n\nAt no time in American history are students and their schools more tested and ranked than today. With every changing season, it seems, comes another report evaluating their educational progress and slippage.\n\nThere are tests that can be used to compare schools within the same district and school districts within each state. There is even the rare instance of one state\u2019s schools ranked against another state's. But we could not find one ranking that measured Providence\u2019s school system against other city systems around the country, as Gemma claimed, let alone that ranked it so poorly.\n\nWe called the state Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, and Rhode Island KIDS COUNT, a statewide children\u2019s policy organization. Neither knew of any national test rankings that ever compared the performance of Providence\u2019s school system with, for example, Los Angeles or Cincinnati.\n\nTerris Ross, a research scientist at The National Center for Education Statistics, an arm of the U.S. Department of Education, said the center does compile an annual list of statistics on the nation\u2019s 100 largest school districts. But it does not rank or compare school districts by achievement or performance.\n\nLocally, Providence\u2019s schools rank among the worst in Rhode Island. According to data by Rhode Island KIDS COUNT, 65 percent of Providence\u2019s public schools made \"insufficient progress\" in 2008 while Cicilline was serving the third of his four terms as mayor.\n\nBut what Gemma\u2019s campaign spokesman supplied as evidence supporting the candidate\u2019s remarks was way off the mark.\n\nIn an e-mail, Alex Morash said Gemma\u2019s claims were based on low marks given in several studies to \u00a0\"Rhode Island and/or Providence schools. \" But how Rhode Island schools fared is not at issue here at all.\n\nGemma specifically criticized Cicilline for the low marks Providence schools allegedly received while Cicilline was mayor. And none of the studies his campaign provided links to specifically ranked Providence against other cities in the nation.\n\nFurther, \u00a0the only reference the Gemma campaign provided of Cicilline using the phrase \"world class\" was a speech Cicilline gave at a school in Cumberland talking about the importance of students -- in general -- receiving a \"world- class\" education.\n\nCicilline was using the phrase as a goal to shoot for -- not, as Gemma claimed, to describe Providence\u2019s schools.\n\nOur ruling\n\nAnthony Gemma, who is challenging David Cicilline in the Democratic primary for Rhode Island\u2019s 1st District congressional seat, said the former Providence mayor had described the capital city\u2019s school system as world class when, in fact, \"not only did Providence not have a world-class school system but as measured, was amongst the last school system in the entire country.\"\n\nWe\u2019ve already cited why Gemma was wrong about the \"world-class\" remark. Concerning the schools, neither state nor federal education officials know of any national school-district ranking that would have placed the city\u2019s school system among the worst in the country.\n\nAnd Gemma didn\u2019t provide any.\n\nFor those reasons, we rate his statement a world-class False.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10484"}
