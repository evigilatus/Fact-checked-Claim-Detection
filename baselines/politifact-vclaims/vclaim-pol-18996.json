Now flash forward to 2020.\nAfter Ginsburg died Sept. 18, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said President Donald Trump\u2019s nominee \u2014 which he is expected to announce Sept. 26 \u2014 \"will receive a vote on the floor of the United States Senate.\" A Sept. 22 Instagram post says Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, has weighed in on that decision.\n\n(Screenshot from Instagram)\n\"The Merrick Garland decision wasn\u2019t unfair & the notion that someone has to pay the price to make up for it is wrong,\" says a quote attributed to Romney in the post.\n\"This further proves my point that a post-RBG race has NOTHING to do with whether or not voters LIKE @realdonaldtrump anymore,\" wrote Lynne Patton, a longtime Donald Trump associate who works in the Department of Housing and Urban Development, in a caption.\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

So we wanted to check whether he actually said the quote cited in the Instagram post.\nThe post is a paraphrase of comments that Romney made Sept. 22 after releasing a statement saying he\u2019s in favor of voting on a nominee to fill the Supreme Court vacancy before Election Day.\nHere\u2019s what Romney said in an interview with reporters when asked about the decision to block Garland\u2019s nomination in 2016:\n\n\"I wasn't there. I think there's some perception on the part of some writers and others that gee, what happened with Merrick Garland was unfair. I don't agree with that. I don't know whether you think it was a good decision or not but it wasn't unfair because it was consistent with history, it was consistent with precedent. It was consistent with the Constitution. So the idea that the Merrick Garland decision was unfair and therefore it has to be made up by doing something, which also wouldn't make a lot of sense \u2014 which is saying to President Trump, \u2018You can't get your nominee either\u2019 \u2014 that just doesn't follow for me.\u00a0\n\"The Garland decision was consistent with history. The decision to proceed with the new nominee is also consistent with history and precedent. And that's where I come out.\"\n\nRomney did say the decision to block Garland\u2019s appointment to the Supreme Court \"wasn\u2019t unfair\" and that he doesn\u2019t agree with the notion that Republicans should abstain from confirming a new justice before Nov. 3. But he did not say the quote attributed to him in the Instagram post.\nThe post is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.
