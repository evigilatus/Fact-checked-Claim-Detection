The North Carolina Election Council investigates voting irregularities in the ninth chamber of Congress, where the Republican Mark Harris appeared to have defeated the Democratic Dan McCreedy on election night. However, the Board refused to certify Harris &apos; win because it discovered unusual voting patterns among the absent ballots by post. Under the State Act, the Council may order new elections if \"infringements or irregularities have occurred to the extent that they have distorted the results of the entire election and cast doubt on their fairness.\" At the same time, legislators recently drafted a draft voter identification law in response to a November referendum on this idea. The critics of the bill, including San Dan Blue, called on the democratic State to postpone their progress until the completion of the investigation in District 9. Cooper vetoed the draft law of 14 December, but it is expected that the House of Assembly led by the World Democratic Party will revoke its right of veto later this year. \"Public confidence in our electoral system at the lowest level\" Blue, from Raleigh, tweeted in December 6. \"#ncga must take the first steps to restore public confidence and delay further changes in voting requirements or in NC Bd. Until the investigation is completed and a remedy is ordered.\" Is it true that confidence in our electoral system is low? In general, there is not much national data to compare confidence in elections over time, and various opinion polls or studies have put this issue in different formats. There are no data for North Carolina, according to David McLennan, Director of Paul, Meredith College, and Jason Hosser, Director of Paul, University of Elon. However, two national opinion polls stand out for consistency, neither of which refers to 2018 as a low point of confidence in the elections. Trust rises? One of the main sources of historical data is Gallup, who has electoral confidence exploratory data dating back to 2004. The last Gallup poll, when a survey of 1,011 adults was conducted in October, found that 70% of Americans were \"very confident or somewhat\" to be accurately cast and counted in this year's mid-term elections. These results are slightly higher than those of Gallup in 2016, as well as the average historical confidence of 68 per cent in the poll. This year &apos; s results were also 11 percentage points higher than in 2008, a low confidence point collected by Gallup in the elections. Even in the Blue Political Party, Gallup found that confidence in the elections was not particularly low this autumn. Since 2004, Gallup has found that Americans from the same political party occupying the White House are more confident in the accuracy of the elections than the opposition political party. This is also true this year. However, about 66 per cent of the democratic respondents in Gallup expressed confidence in this year &apos; s elections - a decrease from 2016 but still higher than in the 2004 and 2006 and 2008 elections. The polls were conducted in Gallup prior to the elections, as many of the polls were due to the fact that the results sometimes helped to predict voters &apos; voter turnout or enthusiasm. The Blue tweet came about a month after the mid-term elections in a state where one congressional competition has yet to be decided and three legislative races are eligible for recounting. However, the Politi Fukte party struggled to reach any post-election ballot on voters &apos; belief in the results of the elections. The new figures are the best data we can find from Charles Stewart III, a leading professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a member of its Electoral Data and Science Laboratory. Stuart reviewed responses to pre- and post-election surveys in the 2014, 2016 and 2018 elections. Data for 2014 and 2016 were derived from the study of the Congressional Cooperative Elections, while Stewart said that he had collected data this year himself. The 2014 study consisted of 1,000 respondents, 1,500 respondents in 2016 and 1,000 respondents per individual in 2018, as Stuart said. The survey question was, \"How confident are you that your vote will be counted/counted as intended in the last election?\" The responses to this question - both before and after the elections - were higher in 2018 than in previous years. On January 26, 2021, in the North Carolina tweet, Secretary of State Ellen Marshall, Jenna Woodsworth stated, \"She has won state-wide races more than anyone else is likely to be alive.\" \u2022 1 February 2021, there was a drop in the pre-election and post-election points in 2014, according to the maps provided by Stewart. \"As you can see, measured this way, we're certainly not at a low point in 2018,\" wrote Stuart in the e-mail. In 2018, the number of respondents was 84.3 per cent in the pre-election and post-election stages. In contrast, voters were only 50 per cent confident before the 2014 elections, 56 per cent confident after the 2014 elections, and only 59 per cent confident after the 2016 elections. \"I think it's fair to say that when people ask what they think about the accuracy of counting votes at the national level, (which is a good agent of how people feel about running elections), confidence is now less than it was in 2000, when we started asking these questions,\" Stuart said. \"But when you ask people for confidence in counting their own voices, the aggregate figures have been very stable for nearly 20 years.\" Some studies indicate a decrease in voter confidence. But it is not recent or does not specifically address the issue of faith in elections. For example, Stuart's work was included in a study recently published by the Democracy Fund, \"Understanding the experience of voters: the public's view of election management and reform,\" by the electoral researcher Natalie Adona and Professor Paul Grunk of Reid College. * The study concluded that between 2000 and 2012, voters gradually lost confidence that their votes would be counted. The Democracy Fund report contains only data until 2016. Data for 2018 will be available shortly, Adona told Polyte Fact in e-mail. The data in this way summarized: \"The public's confidence in the number of votes is still high with regard to their own votes,\" Adona said. \"Yet, people express less confidence when it comes to voting matters throughout the nation. Since the 2000 elections - when the question of voter confidence began to be asked regularly for surveys - voter confidence in the number of national votes has decreased, while confidence in the number of voters remains constant.\" Lauren Brather, an assistant professor at the San Diego School of Policy and Global Strategy of the University of California, conducted her own study after the November elections this year, which asked Americans to assess their confidence in the results of the mid-term elections on a scale of 0 to 10, where zero means no confidence at all and 10 means absolute confidence. On average the sample was about 1300 Americans was 7, and she said, down from 8 in 2016. She also cited the Gallup Global Prize for Anglo-American Democracies, which found that the percentage of Americans who believed that the elections were \"ratious\" had fallen from 52 per cent in 2006 to 30 per cent in 2016. Trends indicate a decrease in confidence since 2006, which Barthor said in a telephone interview. She asked about Blue's allegation, and said, \"I'm not sure we have data to support it.\" What Blue's office said, when Poletti Fukte contacted him, referred to national opinion polls by NPR/Marist and Bio Research. According to the September consultation of 949 adults, 47 per cent of respondents said that they believed that some votes would not be counted in the November elections. Lee Meringoff, Director of the Marisette School of Public Opinion, described the results as \"a very poor report card on the state of American elections.\" However, Marest did not have data to compare this year &apos; s results with those of previous years, or to address the overall confidence of voters in the electoral system. The Pio research study, published in December 2017, found that trust in government had reached levels of \"near history.\" While public confidence in the Government may provide insights into the level of its confidence in the elections, the topics are not synonymous. Research published in the Electoral Law magazine in 2015, \"Confidence in voting: how to measure it and how it differs from government support,\" shows that voter confidence in elections is not necessarily followed by confidence in government. In their summaries, researchers Luna Ray Atkeson, R. Michael Alvarez and Thad E. Hall wrote: \"The voters often trust the election, but they don't trust the government.\" Another poll in Pyo, published in October 29, found that 89 per cent of the surveyed Americans believed that polling staff would \"good work\" in mid-term elections. Only 45% were \"very confident\" that election systems are safe from hacking. However, it is unclear how these responses are compared to previous years. Pyo has not consistently asked voters about their views on the elections over the years, according to Haley Nolan's spokesman. She said: \"So we don't have trend data for comparison.\" Our Governor Blue claimed that \"public confidence in our electoral system is at the lowest level ever.\" This allegation is seriously undermined by the lack of historical data. Some studies point to low confidence, but they are incomplete or outdated. Some of the most powerful recent data do not support Blue's tweet. We assess his claim is wrong. This story was produced by the North Carolina Fact Review Project, a partnership from Maclachi Carolina, Duke University Reporter Laboratory and Fact Politics. The local news laboratory fund and the International Centre for Journalists support the project, which shares fact checks with news rooms throughout the state. * The Democracy Fund is one of the financial supporters of the political film.
