The president himself has urged the media to report his name, as have a Trump ally, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and other Republicans on Capitol Hill.\u00a0\n\"The View\" co-host Sunny Hostin, a former federal prosecutor who also serves as senior legal correspondent and analyst for ABC News, suggested that the younger Trump's tweet may have broken the law.\nHere\u2019s the exchange between Trump, his girlfriend Kimberly Guilfoyle, and Hostin:\nHostin: \"Kimberly, you\u2019re a lawyer\u2026 Did you advise your boyfriend that it is a federal crime to out a whistleblower?\"\nTrump Jr.: \"It\u2019s only a federal crime for the (inspector general) to do it. That\u2019s in the statute.\"\nHostin: \"That\u2019s a lie. ... Under U.S. Code section 1505, it is a crime. \u2026 My law degree says it is.\"\nIs Trump right that \"it\u2019s only a federal crime for the IG\" to out a whistleblower?\" He\u2019s accurately described the most relevant law on this subject, but he\u2019s glossed over a few other statutes that could come into play.\n\"There is no statute that contains a general prohibition on disclosing the name of a whistleblower except for the provision that says the IG and his staff can\u2019t disclose it,\" said Robert Litt, an attorney who served as general counsel for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence during the Obama administration.\nHowever, Litt added, \"That\u2019s not the end of the story. There are other statutes that, depending on the circumstances could apply.\"\nThe barrier to disclosure by the inspector general\nSeveral independent legal experts agreed with Trump\u2019s retort about the inspector general. As Trump noted in a followup tweet, it comes from U.S. Code Section \u202f3033, which specifically bars the inspector general from releasing a name, but is silent on others who would do so.\n\"There is no overarching protection for the identity of the whistleblower under federal law,\" Dan Meyer, a former executive director of an intelligence community whistleblower program, told NPR. \"Congress has never provided that protection.\"\nAnother part of Section 3033 does provide broader protection for workplace \"reprisal.\" But by addressing \"disclosure\" and \"reprisal\" separately, the law suggests that disclosure by itself doesn\u2019t amount to reprisal \u2014 and that disclosure alone doesn\u2019t qualify for the stronger protections granted against \"reprisal.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtections for covert operatives, obstruction of justice, witness retaliation\nOther provisions of federal law could possibly cover the whistleblower scenario, but we can\u2019t say they\u2019d be relevant without knowing more than we do now.\nA 1982 amendment to the National Security Act of 1947 makes it a crime to intentionally disclose \"any information identifying\" a covert intelligence agent.\nThis provision would be irrelevant if the whistleblower is not a covert agent. Reports based on anonymous sources have said the whistleblower is a CIA officer who had been detailed to the White House.\nMeanwhile, there\u2019s another argument: that revealing the whistleblower\u2019s name is tantamount to obstructing justice \u2014 in this case, the work of Congress in carrying out impeachment.\nThis is what Hostin was getting at when she referred to Section 1505, which makes it a crime if someone \"corruptly, or by threats or force \u2026 influences, obstructs, or impedes \u2026 the due and proper administration of the law.\"\nThis passage specifically mentions a congressional proceeding, legal experts pointed out, which would seem to cover the example of the impeachment inquiry.\u00a0\nThere\u2019s a related statute on witness retaliation that may be relevant as well. Section 1513 makes it a crime to retaliate against someone \"for providing to a law enforcement officer any truthful information relating to the commission or possible commission of any Federal offense.\"\nSome attorneys argue that the scenario involving the whistleblower would qualify under one or both of these provisions.\u00a0\nSection 1513 was cited by a lawyer for the whistleblower in a cease-and-desist letter sent to the White House, an ABC spokeswoman noted. And on Nov. 9, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff released a statement that cited \"the president\u2019s effort to threaten, intimidate, and retaliate against the whistleblower.\"\nSections 1505 and 1513 \"would make it criminal to harm the whistleblower in his or her \u2018employment\u2019 or \u2018livelihood,\u2019\" said Stephen M. Kohn, a founding partner of Kohn, Kohn & Colapinto LLP, a law firm specializing in whistleblower representation. \"This covers any person \u2014 federal employee or not. Because an intelligence community employee needs to maintain a level of confidentiality to perform his or her job, including overseas assignments, I believe that \u2018outing\u2019 this person would constitute a serious criminal offense.\"\nThere\u2019s another potential negative consequence for the person outing a whistleblower short of criminal liability: They could leave themselves open to lawsuits for damages.\nThis is not an idle concern, given that the whistleblower has received death threats and is under security measures, the whistleblower\u2019s co-counsel, Andrew Bakaj, told USA Today.\nOur ruling\nTrump said, \"It\u2019s only a federal crime for the\" inspector general to out a whistleblower.\nHe has zeroed in on the clearest legal barrier to outing a whistleblower (at least one who isn\u2019t a covert operative). However, it would be possible to argue in court that outing a whistleblower also qualifies as obstruction of justice or witness retaliation, which \u2014 if a judge agrees \u2014 would be another scenario in which this results in a federal crime.\nThe statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16769"}
