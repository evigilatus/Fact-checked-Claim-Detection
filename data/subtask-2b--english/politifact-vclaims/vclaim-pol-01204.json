We decided to find out if Burlington\u2019s electricity usage has really gone down over the past three decades.\nAsked about the claim, Weinberger\u2019s office pointed us to the Burlington Electric Department\u2019s 2017 Energy Efficiency Annual Report.\n\"Overall electricity use in 2017 was about 4.0% lower than in 1989,\" the report says. \u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden canceled the Keystone pipeline because Warren Buffett \u201cdonated $58 million\u201d to his campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe annual report actually relied on electricity use in 2016, said Mike Kanarick, manager of communications for Burlington Electric Department. \u00a0\nHe said 1989 was the first year Burlington began investing in energy efficiency. In 1990, the city passed an $11.3 million bond for efficiency projects.\nIn 1989, BED sold 353,562,840 kilowatt hours of electricity, while in 2016, the utility sold 340,281,192 kWh \u2014 a decrease of 3.76 percent.\nThe actual figure from 2017 is even lower, Kanarick noted. Since publication of the report, utility staff calculated that BED sold 332,090,724 wWh in 2017, which is 6.07 percent less than in 1989, he said.\nHowever, it hasn\u2019t been a steady downward trend over the past three decades. It\u2019s been up and down. Burlington\u2019s electricity use was actually higher in 2016 than it was during 12 years since 1989. The lowest electricity consumption during that time was in 1996.\nOur data analysis shows that the general trend in Burlington\u2019s total electricity usage has actually been slightly upward, although per capita usage has been going down.\n\n\n\u00a0\nOur rating\nWeinberger\u2019s statement is correct -- the city\u2019s electricity consumption was about 4 percent lower in 2016 than in 1989. But that statistic is not reflective of the general trend in Burlington\u2019s energy usage, which has been on a slight upward trajectory during that time.\nWhat the mayor said is technically true, but it might give the wrong impression.\nWe rate this Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01204"}
