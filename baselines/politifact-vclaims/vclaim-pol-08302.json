He says that determining the classification of marijuana is \"a job for Congress,\" not \"the job of Congress.\" That could mean Obama philosophically believes that Congress should ultimately decide the fate of marijuana, even if his administration has some control over it.\nAnd to be clear, it does. But it\u2019s complicated and not without roadblocks.\nFirst, a quick history lesson.\nCongress passed the Controlled Substance Act in 1970, and it was signed by President Richard Nixon later that year. The law set up guidelines to regulate and enforce the usage, production, sale and importation of various drugs and substances.\nIn the law, Congress created five schedules to classify drugs and narcotics by medical use and potential to incite substance abuse. At one end of the scale is Schedule V drugs, which include substances like cough medicines with small amounts of the narcotic codeine.\nOn the other end of the spectrum are Schedule I substances. These drugs have no accepted medical use and \"are considered the most dangerous class of drugs with a high potential for abuse and potentially severe psychological and/or physical dependence,\" according to the Drug Enforcement Administration. Distribution, manufacturing or possession of a Schedule I substance is a federal offense.\nWhen Congress passed the Controlled Substance Act, lawmakers singled out several dozen drugs that fall under this category. Among opiates, like heroin, and amphetamines, Congress included marijuana.\nCongress could amend the law to reschedule marijuana or exempt the substance altogether, as it did for alcohol and tobacco products.\nBut there is another way to lawfully reclassify marijuana and it does involve the executive branch.\nAccording to the Controlled Substance Act, the attorney general, through the Drug Enforcement Administration, has the power to change the classification of a substance or remove it entirely, but only if the drug meets certain criteria.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, the attorney general reviews eight factors to determine what schedule to assign a substance, according to the law.\n\n\nThe drug's actual or relative potential for abuse\n\n\nScientific evidence of its pharmacological effect, if known\n\n\nThe state of current scientific knowledge regarding the\ndrug\n\n\nIts history and current pattern of abuse\n\n\nThe scope, duration, and significance of abuse\n\n\nWhat, if any, risk there is to the public health\n\n\nThe drug's psychic or physiological dependence liability\n\n\nWhether the drug is an immediate precursor of a substance already controlled under the Controlled Substances Act.\n\n\nIf the DEA feels a substance should be reclassified, the agency can request a scientific and medical evaluation from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to determine if there are safe medical uses for the drug in question. Anyone from a drug company to a local government or even an individual citizen can also petition for review of a drug.\nWhatever conclusion HHS determines \"shall be binding on the attorney general as to such scientific and medical matters,\" according to the law. That means the DEA cannot change the classification of a drug unless HHS says there are medical uses and it\u2019s safe for consumption.\nThe Food and Drug Administration, the agency under Health and Human Services that handles these reviews, has continually reaffirmed that \"the scientific evidence to date is not sufficient for the marijuana plant to gain FDA approval.\" While research continues, the FDA said because marijuana can be addictive and clinical testing on the benefits of marijuana are not conclusive, it won\u2019t give the DEA the go-ahead to reclassify the drug.\nIn 2001 and 2011 the DEA, citing FDA research, turned down petitions to reclassify marijuana, and in 2006, the FDA upheld that \"smoked marijuana has no currently accepted or proven medical use in the United States.\" Guidelines updated as recently as 2012 reflected that opinion.\nMany scientists have debated the merits of the FDA\u2019s ruling, but in an email to PolitiFact, the White House reiterated that the agency\u2019s findings serve as the basis for any action from the Justice Department.\nSo basically, there is a mechanism for the executive branch to change the schedules. But it\u2019s an arduous process and not something Obama can change by decree. And while the FDA is an executive agency that includes presidential appointees, the FDA\u2019s recommendations are supposed be based on science, not politics.\nBut Obama has found other ways to get around the FDA\u2019s unwillingness to concede the medical benefits of marijuana to appease states that have gone a different direction.\nSchedule I substances cannot legally be used for medical purposes; however, 20 states and the District of Columbia have passed laws legalizing medical marijuana. In 2009, the Obama administration told federal law enforcement agencies to stop targeting medical marijuana dispensaries, signaling a change from the approach of President George W. Bush.\nSimilarly, last year the Department of Justice said it would not target new laws in Colorado and Washington legalizing recreational marijuana.\nSo even though marijuana remains a Schedule 1 substance, the current administration, through various memorandums, has not always treated it as one under the law.\nOur ruling\nObama said \"what is and isn't a Schedule I narcotic is a job for Congress.\" While Obama may feel that way philosophically, there is a process by which the executive branch can reclassify marijuana to allow for its medical use or completely remove it from the list of controlled substances. It\u2019s not an easy process, but it\u2019s there.\nAnd Obama\u2019s Justice Department has often given tacit approval, or at least turned a blind eye, when states have taken steps to ignore the federal government\u2019s classification.\nWe rate his statement Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08302"}
