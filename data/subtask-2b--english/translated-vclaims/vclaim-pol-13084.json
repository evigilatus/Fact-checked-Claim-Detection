Both former legislators, young people, Vassman, and well-spoken speaking speaking machines often appear together to defend their respective politics and candidates. The controversial Fifth Senate Bill, the new law that reviews the state collective bargaining rules for some 360,000 government employees, guided the discussion on several points on the May 4 program hosted by the Tipov columnist, Mike McIntyre. :: Democrats and workers &apos; groups strongly oppose the law and wish to present it to voters in November. However, in connection with the programme that defined itself as a democracy, he complained that the party was overly influenced by labour groups. That's not what Redfern said. \"During the past six months, for example, the Ohio Democratic Party has raised $1.1 million since the November elections. A very small proportion of that came from organized work.\" Given the weakness of Polyte Fact Ohio in political bragging, especially the bragging that includes statistics - we decided to take a closer look. Redfern &apos; s reference to the past six months coincides with the current election cycle, which began when books closed on fund-raising for the November 2010 elections. Polyte Fact Ohio requested the calculation of $1.1 million and trade union contributions because political donations are not reported in real time and parties usually have several accounts. The spokesperson for the Seth Gellman Party said that money had been raised this calendar year; after the November elections, funds had not been raised seriously until after the December recess. This year, the party raised $383,191 for its federal campaign, which is used when the party promotes a candidate for federal office, such as the United States Senate, saying: The Federal Electoral Commission requests the party to submit monthly reports on contributions to the Federal Account. :: Polyte Fukte reviewed the party &apos; s allegations against the records of the Federal Electoral Commission and found the exact number. As detailed in his April \"pre-primary\" report to the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ohio, the party raised another account of $477,901 to the State account: The report shows that the party raised $455,281. The minor difference results from the recovery of funds and other accounting issues required by the State. For analysis, Polyte Fact Ohio uses the figure reported to the State. Polyte Fact Ohio verified $858,472 through records. The remaining funds - approximately $242,000 - would be detailed in future reports. This is what we should learn from him, because he will be able to make it easy for the holy brothers to come true. Then we looked at what percentage of the money was collected from the workers' groups. Berman provided a list of contributions from the labour organizations that he received this year. The total contributions, including $25,000 from the Ohio Education Association, amount to $66,645. This translates into about 6 per cent of the total collected this year. Polyte Fact Ohio matched the work donations with the state report And Berman insisted that the next reports detailing the remaining $140,000 wouldn't show any extra money from the workers' group. We have also assessed whether the funds raised from the work over the past six months reflect what the Democratic Party usually derives from the work. Is this form an anomaly that serves Redfern's interest in responding to the caller? In the radio programme, Redfern went on to say that \"our financial support has been and will always be\" by individual donors, many of whom make small contributions. This comment received a reprimand from Diwin, who said that the amount of money that labour groups contributed to Democrats in 2010 was \"marrying.\" The President of the Republican Party issued a paper to us that showed $8.2 million in contributions from labour groups to democratic candidates in 2010 - including candidates for the Ohio General Assembly and state-wide offices - and for democratic parties in the states and districts. The Jatman programme estimated that the State party, state-wide candidates, candidates in the General Assembly and provincial parties had raised some $50 million together in 2010. This means that trade union donations account for about 16 per cent. Facebook published on January 27, 2021, in Facebook, says that Joe Biden canceled the Keystone pipeline because Warren Buffett \"doned $58 million\" for his campaign. \u2022 January 29, 2012, where does this leave Redfern's statements of truth or meter? The campaign figures support his claim that his party has raised $1.1 million since November. The unions contributed a little less than 7% of the total, allowing Redfern to speak generously -- claiming it's a \"very small percentage\" of what I've collected so far. One important warning: figures provided by both Democrats and the People &apos; s Democratic Party take into account only the funds given to the Democratic Party and its candidates. However, this does not include any funds directly spent by labour organizations on behalf of a candidate. This is part of the additional information that provides clarification. On the Book of Truth O-Meter, we assess Redfern's claim mostly true.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13084"}
