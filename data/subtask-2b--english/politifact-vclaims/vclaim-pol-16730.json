Scott Walker were lambasted in 2015 for attempting to remove key portions of the public records law, keeping many more records \u2014 including emails \u2014 from public view.\nBut in his first year in office, the Democratic governor has drawn fire on a number of transparency-related issues.\nHe initially refused to release a letter that had been given to him by the departing Walker.\nHe was sued by the conservative MacIver Institute, which alleged Evers\u2019 office excluded the group from email distribution of news releases and barred the organization from a news briefing.\nHe scrapped a public website created under Gov. Scott Walker that tracked compliance on public records requests.\nMost recently, Evers drew criticism from open records advocates and journalists after his office refused to release a day\u2019s worth of emails. The governor said state law doesn\u2019t allow it.\nAmid criticism, Evers later decided to release the emails as requested.\nThat makes this a good time to break out our Flip-O-Meter. We use this to rate whether officials have been consistent on an issue \u2014 without making a value judgment on whether that change is good or bad.\nLet\u2019s get to it.\nEvers\u2019 first position\nThe controversy started in September 2019 when FOX6-TV\u2019s Amanda St. Hilaire requested more than four weeks of emails from Evers and his chief of staff. That was denied, as were follow-up requests for one week of emails and one day of emails.\nThe denial letters cited a section of state statute that says a records request is insufficient if it does not have \"a reasonable limitation as to subject matter or length of time represented by the record.\"\nEvers\u2019 team interpreted that to mean every request must be limited as to both time and subject matter.\n\"Wisconsin public records law provides that any request for a record may be deemed insufficient for lacking \u2018a reasonable limitation as to subject matter,\u2019 just as it may be deemed insufficient for lacking a length of time,\" the second denial letter to FOX6 said.\nBut open records advocates objected to that interpretation.\n\"It turns public records requests into a guessing game,\" April Barker, an open records attorney, told FOX6. \"You don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know, so you don\u2019t know what to ask for.\"\nAnd other top officials in state government made no such argument in response to identical requests from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Steineke\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembly Republicans \u201chave come to the table\u201d and were part of \u201cgive and take\u201d compromise on a coronavirus bill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald and Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, both Republicans, provided the requested emails within days. So did two top Democrats: Senate Minority Leader Jennifer Shilling and Assembly Minority Leader Gordon Hintz.\nEvers said his position on releasing his emails was based on how Walker handled such requests and on advice from Attorney General Josh Kaul, a Democrat, and his predecessor, Attorney General Brad Schimel, a Republican.\nAn Associated Press request for a week of emails in March 2016 was denied by Walker\u2019s office. A letter from Assistant Legal Counsel David J. Rabe said the law \"requires that a request must include limitations as to subject matter and length of time.\" Rabe said the office interpreted the \"or\" in statute to mean both items are required.\nWith Evers, the email saga dragged out nearly two months before FOX6 spoke to Evers directly on the matter.\nEvers told FOX6 on Nov. 1, 2019, he wasn\u2019t aware of the request. He then said, \"yeah\" when asked if the public should be able to see a day\u2019s worth of his emails.\nBut a few days later he spoke as if his hands were tied by the open records law.\n\"We have to obey the law \u2014 that's the problem,\" Evers told reporters on Nov. 13 after a bill signing ceremony. \"We have people who are willing to help folks that need that information to do it in a way that's consistent with state law but we're not going to go in a different direction than state law \u2014 it's important to follow the law.\"\nIt's a position open records advocates decried as legally dubious. But it\u2019s the position Evers staked out.\nUntil he didn\u2019t.\nEvers\u2019 second position\nOn Nov. 27, 2019, Evers\u2019 staff granted an open records request for his emails filed by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\u2019s Molly Beck. Similar to FOX6, she had asked for all emails sent and received by Evers on one day \u2014 Nov. 12, 2019.\nA letter to Beck offered a one-paragraph explanation for the change, treating the decision as an exception rather than a new interpretation of statute.\n\"Your request lacks a subject matter. See Wis. Stat. \u00a7 19.35(1)(h),\" reads the unsigned letter from Evers\u2019 Office of Legal Counsel. \"Despite this, we are making an exception to this requirement, and are providing the responsive records.\"\nThe only emails released for that day were copies of two news releases and Evers\u2019 daily schedule. The letter also noted the emails had been redacted to withhold security information, phone numbers and the governor\u2019s direct email address.\nOur ruling\nResponding to requests for one day of his emails, Evers first said he would not release them. Then he released them.\nEvers\u2019 team attempts to have it both ways in the release letter. They say their interpretation hasn\u2019t changed that a request without subject matter isn\u2019t sufficient, but they then release the records as an \"exception\" (leaving the door open for future denials on these grounds).\nBut that doesn\u2019t line up with how Evers himself described the matter.\nEvers\u2019 statement on Nov. 13 was not simply that he wouldn\u2019t release the records, but that he couldn\u2019t \u2014 \"We have to obey the law \u2014 that's the problem.\" Based on his later action, that\u2019s clearly not the case.\nThat makes Evers\u2019 later decision to release the records a change in position, or what we call a Full Flop.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16730"}
