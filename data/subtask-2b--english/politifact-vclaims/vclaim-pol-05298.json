Marco Rubio, includes clips of CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper and Trump.\nTapper: \"I asked Donald Trump three times if he would disavow the support of David Duke and the Ku Klux Klan.\"\nTrump: \"Well, I have to look at the group.\"\nNarrator: \"Trump refuses to denounce the KKK. Think about that \u2014 for president?\"\nBecause the ad has aired more than 430 times in Florida, according to Political TV Ad Archive, we thought it was worth taking a closer look.\nWe gave the billionaire businessman a\u00a0Pants on Fire\u00a0rating for claiming to not to know anything about Duke. But\u00a0it\u2019s a stretch to say Trump \"refuses to denounce the KKK\" given his record of denouncements before and after the Tapper interview.\nThe ad cites a Time article recapping Trump\u2019s Feb. 28 interview on CNN\u2019s State of the Union, where Trump dodged multiple questions from Tapper asking if he\u2019d disavow the support of white supremacist and former KKK leader David Duke (he would later blame a \"bad earpiece\" for his noncommittal answers).\nTrump\u2019s history with Duke has been pretty well documented by PolitiFact and fellow fact-checkers at the Washington Post and Factcheck.org.\u00a0\nIn a 1991 interview with CNN\u2019s Larry King, Trump said he \"hated\" what Duke\u2019s success with white voters in a failed bid for the Louisiana governorship represented.\nKing: \"Did the David Duke thing bother you? Fifty-five percent of the whites in Louisiana voted for him.\"\n\nTrump: \"I hate \u2014\"\n\nKing: \"Four hundred New Yorkers contributed.\"\n\nTrump: \"I hate seeing what it represents, but I guess it just shows there's a lot of hostility in this country. There's a tremendous amount of hostility in the United States.\"\n\nKing: \"Anger?\"\n\nTrump: \"It's anger. I mean, that's an anger vote. People are angry about what's happened. People are angry about the jobs. If you look at Louisiana, they're really in deep trouble.\"\nIn 2000, Trump declined to run a Reform Party presidential bid in part because the party attracted the support of Duke, a \"Klansman.\"\n\"This is not company I wish to keep,\" he said at the time.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 23, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBiden invested the entire family fortune in Ukraine gas and oil.

I would certainly repudiate.\"\nThe story popped up again after Buzzfeed reported on Feb. 25 that Duke was urging his supporters to vote for Trump, saying on his radio show that failure to do so would be \"treason to your heritage.\"\nAsked about the endorsement the next day at a press conference, Trump said he wasn\u2019t aware of it.\n\"I didn\u2019t even know he endorsed me,\" he said. \"David Duke endorsed me? Okay, all right. I disavow, okay?\"\nAfter the interview with Tapper, Trump rejected Duke\u2019s support in interviews on Good Morning America and Morning Joe, calling him a \"bad person who I disavowed on numerous occasions over the years.\"\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Duke, despite his support for white nationalism and former membership in neo-Nazi and openly racist groups, hasn\u2019t been associated with the Klan for more than 40 years.\nDuke founded a Louisiana chapter of the racist group in 1974, but left the organization in 1980 because of its tendency towards violence and his inability to stop members of other chapters from doing \"stupid or violent things.\"\nThe modern-day Klan is a hodgepodge of dozens of independent chapters spread throughout the country with a total membership around 5,000, according to the Anti-Defamation League.\nThere\u2019s no central Klan organization that represents every chapter, but Arkansas-based Knights Party spokeswoman Rachel Pendergraft told Politico in December that Trump was a major talking point in the group\u2019s recruitment efforts.\nOur ruling\nA pro-Rubio super PAC said, \"Trump refuses to denounce the KKK.\"\nTrump hasn\u2019t gone after the KKK and white nationalists like Duke with the same fervor as his opponents, but it\u2019s inaccurate\u00a0to make a blanket statement based on a single interview given his history of rejecting white supremacists.\nWe rate the ad as Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05298"}
