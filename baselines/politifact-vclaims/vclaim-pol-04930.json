And that's fine. But we know what we're going into, and we understand what it's going to take to win in the fall,\" she said. \"And finally, I would say that, you know, polls this far out mean nothing.\"\nClinton has a point that compared with her, Sanders hasn\u2019t really felt the burn of negative ad blitzes from Republican groups. But her claim that he hasn\u2019t had \"a single ad ever run against him\" is an exaggeration. \u00a0\nDem-on-Dem negative campaigning\nMany\u00a0of the attacks we found on Sanders in the Political TV Ad Archive actually come from other Democrats, including by Clinton supporters. \u00a0\nGeneration Forward, a pro-Martin O\u2019Malley super PAC, went after Sanders while O\u2019Malley was still in the race. In an attack ad, the group highlighted Sanders\u2019 and Clinton\u2019s Saturday Night Live portrayals and less-than-serious moments on the campaign trail (i.e. dancing). It ended with O\u2019Malley saying a presidency shouldn\u2019t be about entertainment.\nAnother ad attacked Sanders for his record on guns: \"Bernie Sanders voted against the Brady Bill \u2014 background checks and waiting periods. ... Bernie Sanders is no progressive when it comes to guns.\" (We rated the claim about background checks Mostly True.)\nThe Sanders campaign\u00a0referred\u00a0us to web videos by Correct the Record, a super PAC hybrid known as a Carey committee that supports Clinton. The group\u2019s YouTube channel includes at least 13 negative videos about Sanders.\u00a0(Correct the Record said that its videos are not ads as it does not \"do any paid public communications.\")\nOne focuses on Sanders\u2019 controversial interview with the New York Daily News and is entitled \"Bernie Sanders\u2019 Sandy Hook Shame.\" Another asks, \"Will Bernie Sanders explain why he\u2019s sided with the gun lobby time and time again?\" (This charge is largely inaccurate.) Others focus on Sanders\u2019 \"going negative\" against Clinton and his record with fact-checkers.\nThe Clinton campaign itself sent a President's Day-themed attack ad against Sanders through text messages, BuzzFeed reported. After audio of Sanders saying it would be a good idea if President Barack Obama \"faced primary opposition\" in 2012, the text reads, \"Hillary is the only one in this race who\u2019ll fight for the progress we\u2019ve made under Pres. Obama.\"\nLargely, but not totally spared by Republicans\nClinton, who has been a national figure and subject of GOP criticism for decades, is right that she\u2019s faced far more negative campaigning than Sanders has.\nThe Political TV Ad Archive includes some 120 ads either attacking Clinton directly or drawing unfavorable parallels between her and Republican candidates. Besides virtually all of the 2016 contenders on the GOP side, Clinton\u2019s been consistently hit by \u00a0conservative super PACs, the Republican National Committee and even some down-ballot GOP candidates.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo shows man upset because he was added to the no-fly list for storming the Capitol.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSanders, on the other hand, has been largely spared by the Republican attack machine this cycle, and Clinton\u2019s campaign sent us several articles to that point. Given that the ads would write themselves (\"And everyone knows what that pummeling would focus on: He's a self-proclaimed socialist,\" writes Mother Jones\u2019 David Corn), why are Republicans leaving Sanders alone?\nThe answer seems to be that they don\u2019t really see him as a threat.\n\"Sanders has an important message that is resonating with many. But that is not enough to win the nomination. Why spend money that will have little return on the investment?\" said John G. Geer, a political science professor at Vanderbilt University who wrote\u00a0In Defense of Negativity: Attack Advertising in Presidential Campaign and spoke with us in April.\nIn one case, a\u00a0\"faux attack\" from a conservative super PAC appears to actually bolster Sanders, illustrating another line of argument: Republicans may prefer to run against the more radical Sanders in a general election. \u00a0\nThough Sanders hasn\u2019t been hit nearly as hard as Clinton, he has been attacked by the right a few times. Future 45, a conservative Super PAC funded by backers of Marco Rubio, ran a 30-second spot sounding the alarms on higher taxes to come under Sanders.\nSanders is also featured in Republican-on-Republican attack ads as an unfavorable comparison.\nFor example, the anti-Trump Club for Growth has highlighted similarities between Trump\u2019s positions and Sanders\u2019 (as well as Clinton\u2019s and Obama\u2019s). Similarly, American Future Fund, a conservative 501(c)(4) or \"dark money\" group, ran an attack ad against Ted Cruz by lumping him in with Sanders and other Democrats on national security issues.\nMike Huckabee\u2019s campaign, meanwhile, warned voters about \"a crazy old man named Bernie\" in a rhyming Christmas-themed ad and crooned\u00a0\"Hello from the caucus night. If Bernie wins, I\u2019m going to die\" in an Adele-inspired attack.\nWe should also note 2016 is not the 74-year-old\u2019s first time around the block. He has, after all, competed in political races since the 1970s.\nSanders spokesman Michael Briggs pointed to \"blistering negative ads in his first Senate campaign.\" In 2006, Sanders\u2019 Republican opponent Richard Tarrant spent millions on ads accusing Sanders of wanting to protect child molesters and voting against single-working mothers. They didn\u2019t end up doing much for Tarrant, who lost to Sanders by 33 percentage points.\nOur ruling\nClinton said,\u00a0\"Let me say that I don't think (Sanders has) had a single negative ad ever run against him.\"\u00a0\nThe number of attack ads against Sanders pales in comparison to the number against Clinton, but she\u2019s wrong that he\u2019s been completely spared.\nDemocratic groups, including one supporting Clinton, and Republican outfits alike have gone after Sanders.\nWe rate her claim False.\nUpdate, May 23, 2016: This report has been updated to include a response we received from Correct the Record after initial publication.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/d7df3b83-bd90-4892-b050-86ae781485af", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04930"}
