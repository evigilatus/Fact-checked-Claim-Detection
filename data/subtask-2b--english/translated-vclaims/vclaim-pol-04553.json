When Trump sat in an interview with George Stefanopoulos of ABC News shortly after the National Democratic Congress, Stefanopoulos raised this issue. Trump Stefanoplos told that he was not having an affair with Putin. Stefanopoulos challenged him in this -- and the host was on solid ground. The fact that Trump denied the relationship with Putin is contrary to what he has said on many previous occasions. Before early 2016, Trump seemed to have had a chatty relationship with the Russian leader. Trump, a lifetime businessman, boasts of foreign policy experience based on his experience hosting the Miss Universe contest in Moscow in 2013. For example, during an interview with Fox News on May 6, 2016, Trump told host Brett Bayer, \"I know Russia well. I had a big event in Russia two or three years ago, the Miss Universe contest, which was a big, big, incredible event. Unbelievable success.\" However, tramp &apos; s close claims to Russia during Putin raised critical questions, including foreign policy professionals on both sides. The United States Government believes that Russia is a geopolitical competition and that Putin in particular is sometimes a problematic force in international relations. The apparent love of Putin was a cause of concern to critics on both sides. For example, a few days before he met Stefanopoulos after he seemed to encourage Russia to spy on the United States to find thousands of e-mails from Hillary Clinton. \"Russian, if you listen, I hope you can find 30,000 lost e-mails,\" he said. Trump said during a press conference in Florida, So, in the face of growing questions about the wisdom of linking his star to Putin's star, did Trump change his position on whether they both had a relationship or not? Here's a closer look. The previous Trump comments referring to a relationship with Putin were four occasions between 2013 and 2015 when Trump tore apart his relations with Putin. \u2022 When Thomas Roberts of the National Security Department of Trump asked, \"Do you have a relationship with Vladimir Putin? An interactive relationship or anything that you feel you have influence or influence over his government? Trump answered: \"I have a relationship, and I can tell you that he's very interested in what we're doing here today. He's probably very interested in what you and I are saying today, and I'm sure he'll see it somehow.\" - Interview, November 2013: \"You know, I was in Moscow two months ago. I own the Miss Universe contest and they treated me so well. Even Putin sent me a gift, a beautiful gift.\" - Address at the ASEAN Conference, March 2014 - \"Russians no longer respect our country. They believe that we have been severely weakened, both militarily and otherwise, and that he certainly does not respect President Obama. So what I would do - for example, I own the Miss Universe, I was in Russia, I was in Moscow recently, and I spoke, indirectly and directly, to President Putin, who could not have been nicer, and we had a tremendous success. It was live from Moscow, and we had a tremendous success there and it was amazing, but to do well, you get the other side to respect you, and he doesn't respect our president, which is very sad.\" A speech at the National Press Club, May 2014: \"As far as Ukraine is concerned... if Putin wants to go in -- and I got to know him very well because we were both in 60 minutes. We were stable buddies, and we did well that night. Part of the answer is in Focus Business News, November 2015. (The idea that the two men appeared together in 60 minutes was dismantled. As Time magazine briefly stated, \"In fact, they weren't even on the same continent.\" But recently, Trump changed his tune. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u25cf January 11, 2012, these are excerpts from the Trump - Stefanopoulos interview, which was broadcast on ABC this week on July 31. Stefanoplos: \"Let's talk about Russia. I did a lot of headlines with Russia this week. What exactly is your relationship with Vladimir Putin?\" Trump: \"I have nothing to do with him. I have nothing to do with him.\" Stefanoplos: \"But if you don't have a relationship with Putin, why did you say in 2013 that I have a relationship. In 2014, Trump spoke: \"Because he said nice things about me over the years. I remember years ago, he said something -- many years ago, he said something very nice about me. I said something good about it when Larry King was on. That was a long time ago. And you said it was a strong biscuits or something. He said something nice about me. That's what was happening. We did 60 minutes together. By the way, not together, which means he might have been shot in Moscow.\" Stefanoplos: \"Well, he was in Moscow.\" Trump: \"I was shot in New York.\" Stefanoplos: \"I was in New York. But that's the thing.\" Trump: \"No, just to understand, he said very nice things about me, but I have nothing to do with him. I've never met him before. I have nothing to do with Putin. I don't think I've met him before. I've never met him. I mean, if he's in the same room or something. But I don't think so. \"Stefanopolus: \"You never spoke to him on the phone?\" Trump: \"I never spoke to him on the phone, no. Well, I don't know what it means to have a relationship. I mean, he was saying very good things about me, but I had nothing to do with him. I didn't meet him. I didn't spend time with him. I didn't have dinner with him. I didn't go for a walk with him. I don't know -- and I don't know him from Adam except I see his picture and I want to know what he looks like.\" Also, on July 27, Trump said at a press conference in Florida, \"I've never met Putin -- I don't know who Putin is. He said something nice about me. He said I was a genius. I said thank you so much for the paper, and that was the end of it. I've never met Putin.\" For information: according to media outlets, the most accurate translation of Putin's statement was \"Flambuant,\" rather than \"genius,\" and Putin later confirmed that he was trying to refer to \"Flambuant\" when he made his remarks. Our judgment changed what Trump said about whether it had anything to do with Putin. In 2013, he said, \"I have a relationship.\" In 2014, he said: \"I spoke, indirectly and directly, to President Putin,\" and said that the Russian leader had sent him a gift. In 2015, he said, \"I got to get to know him very well\" because of their joint appearance in 60 minutes. Lately, though, Trump said, \"I've never met Putin -- I don't know who Putin is,\" and \"I have nothing to do with him.\" We evaluate this a full flop. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/87035b09-c25c-4af3-843f-dfce8d466048", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04553"}
