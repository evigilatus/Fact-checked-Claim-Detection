Is it true that no GOP nominee candidate in almost three decades has earned more support from women than the Democratic nominee?\nMcGhee pointed us to an article published Aug. 7, 2015, in the New York Times. Even though the\u00a0article repeats the statistic without citing a source, we found several datasets that corroborate the claim with slightly different numbers.\nTo be clear, the source of the information is surveys of voters, and includes exit polling data, so it's not an official record. But the surveys are widely cited as the best data\u00a0available.\u00a0\nIn 1988, Republican nominee George H.W. Bush received a single percentage point more of female votes (at 50 percent) than Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis, according to research by the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. Since then, no GOP candidate has \"won\" the women\u2019s vote.\n\nWomen overall have had a higher voter turnout than men in every presidential election for 35 years, almost always favoring liberal candidates. Their allegiance to the Democratic party is reflected in congressional races as well.\nBarack Obama earned 56 percent of women\u2019s votes in 2008 \u2014\u00a0one of the\u00a0highest shares of female voters\u00a0ever\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and 55 percent in 2012.\nWhy do more women vote for Democrats? Aside from more women simply identifying as Democrats than men, women are also more likely to favor left-leaning policies of more government assistance for poor Americans, children and the elderly; providing better access to contraceptives and reproductive health; and protecting the environment, according to the Pew Research Center.\nOther factors include the rise of the powerful pro-choice PAC Emily\u2019s List in the 1980s and 1990s and the controversy over Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas, added Karen O\u2019Connor, a professor of political science at American University's Women & Politics Institute.\n\"Women were very angry,\" O\u2019Connor said of the all-male Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s questioning of Thomas\u2019 former employee, Anita Hill, who accused Thomas of sexual harassment.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe partisan gap has solidified in recent years, but experts say the female vote began to align with Democrats in 1980, eight years before Bush won a slight majority of female voters. Kelly Dittmar of Rutgers\u2019 Center for American Women and Politics lists the feminist movement, increased participation in the labor force, and greater reliance on government programs as reasons for the shift. At the same time, men have shifted right, she said.\nWomen generally favored GOP candidates from the suffrage movement in 1919 through the 1950s. Republican President Herbert Hoover was known as \"the woman's candidate\" in 1928, according to feminist scholar Jo Freeman. Democratic presidential candidates lost the female vote by double digits in 1952 and 1956, according to Gallup data.\n\"Early on, white upper-class women were Republicans,\" explained O\u2019Connor.\nThen came the 1960s, with both parties responding to the feminist movement. The era of bipartisanship was reflected in the presidential elections, with Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson and Republican Richard Nixon each receiving substantial majorities of female votes.\nBy the late 1970s, however, the political divide in women\u2019s votes resurfaced and changed course. Christina Wolbrecht, a professor who studies gender and politics at the University of Notre Dame, points to a specific watershed moment: the 1980 Republican convention, when the party for the first time refused to endorse the Equal Rights Amendment.\n\"By the early 1980s, the two parties stood on opposing sides of the debate over women\u2019s rights,\" Wolbrecht wrote in The Politics of Women\u2019s Rights.\nNot that the GOP wasn\u2019t aware of the divide. In his first term as president, Ronald Reagan responded by enacting policies that appealed to women.\n\"Reagan supported things like tax credits for child care and individual retirement accounts for homemakers, and the White House Working Group for Women was created in 1983,\" said Dittmar of Rutgers. \"He also appointed some women to high-profile posts (such as) Sandra Day O'Connor to the Supreme Court.\"\nIn his 1984 re-election, Reagan beat Walter Mondale and his female vice presidential pick with 56 percent of women supporting him.\nThe experts said women are more driven by party lines than female candidates, which will make it hard for Republicans to upend the trend in 2016. \u00a0\nOur rating\nMcGhee said, \"The Republican presidential nominee hasn\u2019t won women since 1988.\"\nThe data, based on\u00a0surveys of voters, backs her up. George H.W. Bush won his 1988 election campaign with just 1 percentage point more of female votes than his Democratic opponent. No Republican has \"won\" the fight for more women\u2019s votes since.\nWe rate McGhee\u2019s claim True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06092"}
