Protesters occupied several blocks in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Seattle in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s killing. Police cleared the area in July.\u00a0\nThe\u00a0 search led us to an Aug. 13 post on the neighborhood blog Greenpointers, which reports on news in the Greenpoint neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York.\u00a0\nThe headline: \"How a photo of trash in Greenpoint became a photo of Seattle\u2019s \u2018Autonomous Zone.\u2019\"\u00a0\nA Brooklyn resident brought the photo to Greenpointers\u2019 attention after noticing what he thought was a sign for a local parking garage, according to the post. A video in the post taken by another Brooklyn resident shows the scene captured in the Facebook image. The trash sprawled across the street resulted from a lit, discarded cigarette that set a pile of trash bags on fire on June 2.\u00a0\nWe couldn\u2019t find the original image that the Facebook post describes as Sturgis, S.D., which hosted a motorcycle rally in August. But as Reuters points out in its fact-check of a similar post, it appears to be a screenshot of a live feed of the intersection where Junction Avenue and Main Street meet in the city. We don\u2019t know when the screenshot was taken.\u00a0\nRegardless, this Facebook post misuses a photo of the aftermath of a trash fire in Brooklyn to claim that Seattle protesters were responsible for the mess. That\u2019s wrong.\u00a0\nWe rate this post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18877"}
