In June 2019, Roger Stone, one of Trump\u2019s longtime confidants, called for former CIA director John Brennan to be \"hung for treason.\"\nStone was later found guilty of witness tampering and lying to Congress in connection with special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. But he\u2019s not the only Republican who has criticized both Brennan and former FBI director James Comey for the inquiry.\u00a0\nBut neither Comey nor Brennan have been charged with treason. Here\u2019s what we know.\nIn December, the New York Times reported that federal prosecutor John Durham was investigating the role Brennan played in the intelligence community\u2019s assessment that Russia interfered with the 2016 election.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDurham had requested Brennan\u2019s emails, call logs and other documents because he wanted to learn what Brennan told other officials, including Comey, about his and the CIA\u2019s views on a dossier of claims about Trump associates and Russia, according to the New York Times.\nNeither Brennan nor Comey have been indicted. News that the men were facing multiple counts of treason charges would draw wide media coverage, but there are no news stories to corroborate the Facebook post\u2019s claims.\u00a0\nIn August, Durham questioned Brennan for eight hours. Afterward, an aide for Brennan said Durham told Brennan during that interview that Brennan isn\u2019t the target of any criminal inquiry as part of the justice department\u2019s examination of the Russia investigation, according to the Times.\u00a0\nFinally, there is a high bar for charging someone with treason. The Constitution \u2014 which mentions very few crimes specifically \u2014 defines treason very narrowly. It says that treason can only consist in \"levying war\" against the country or giving \"aid and comfort\" to enemies. \"No person shall be convicted of treason unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession in open court,\" according to the Constitution.\nOn the most basic level, treason has to occur in wartime, or during an armed rebellion against the government.\nWe rate this Facebook post False.\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections FactChat #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click\u00a0here, for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18944"}
