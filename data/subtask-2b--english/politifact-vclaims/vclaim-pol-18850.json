He is accused of using an AR-15-style rifle to shoot and kill Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, and injure Gaige Grosskreutz, 26.\u00a0\nThe violence came days after Blake, a 29-year-old Black man, was shot in the back seven times at point-blank range by a Kenosha police officer. Blake remains hospitalized and paralyzed from the waist down, according to his family, as protesters renew calls to combat police brutality that disproportionately affects Black people.\nRittenhouse\u2019s arrest prompted scrutiny of the teenager\u2019s background and frustration over his treatment by Kenosha police \u2014 particularly when compared to Blake\u2019s treatment by officers days prior.\u00a0\nU.S. Rep. Gwen Moore, a Milwaukee Democrat, weighed in with this tweet Aug. 26, 2020:\u00a0\n\"The same police department who shot an unarmed black man 7 times in the back for walking away from them just let an armed white supremacist walk right past them after shooting people.\"\nWe previously looked at claims about the shooting of Blake, and whether he was armed, including that he \"declared he had a gun in the car and was going to go get it\" and was \"brandishing\" a knife. We rated that claim False. There was no gun, and while there are varying reports of whether he had a knife in his hand or it was found on the floorboard of the car he was entering, he was not \"brandishing\" it at police on the scene.\nSo we will focus here on Moore\u2019s characterization of how authorities in Kenosha treated Rittenhouse in the moments after the shooting.\nLet\u2019s take a look at her account.\nWhat happened that night\nWhen asked for evidence to support Moore\u2019s claim, her office pointed to four news articles about the Aug. 25, 2020 incident that led to Rittenhouse\u2019s arrest.\nHere\u2019s what we know:\nAccording to eyewitness videos and the criminal complaint, Rittenhouse shot and killed Rosenbaum in a parking lot after Rosenbaum chased him and tried to grab his gun.\u00a0\nRittenhouse then began running slowly down the street, but tripped and fell as a crowd began to follow him. While he was on the ground, Huber approached him with a skateboard in one hand and reached for Rittenhouse\u2019s gun with the other. Rittenhouse fired one round that hit Huber in the chest and killed him.\nRittenhouse sat up and pointed his gun at Grosskreutz, who took a step back but then moved toward Rittenhouse. He fired a shot that hit Grosskreutz in the arm.\nAfterward, video footage showed Rittenhouse approaching police vehicles with his hands raised. Several vehicles passed him after he waved toward the first. A voice can be heard yelling, \"Hey, he just shot them! Hey, dude right here just shot them!\" Another voice on a police loudspeaker is heard saying, \"Someone injured, straight ahead.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin LeMahieu\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a TV interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It takes quite a while on Election Day to load those ballots, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRittenhouse ultimately returned to his hometown of nearby Antioch, Illinois, where he was later arrested.\nKenosha Police Chief Daniel Miskinis defended his department\u2019s actions in an Aug. 28, 2020 news conference, saying the police in the vehicles didn\u2019t see Rittenhouse as a threat and wouldn\u2019t have heard yelling from the crowd over other noise. He said officers were more focused on the injuries and what happened down the street.\nSo, multiple sources \u2014 including the Kenosha Police Department \u2014 have verified that Rittenhouse walked by police after the shootings. Moore is on target with that part of the claim.\nWhite supremacy allegations\nMerriam-Webster defines a white supremacist as someone who \"believes that the white race is inherently superior to other races and that white people should have control over people of other races.\"\nVideo taken before the shootings showed Rittenhouse with a group of armed, older men linked to a local group called the Kenosha Guard. Leaders of the group, which that afternoon put out a call for people to bring weapons to defend Kenosha businesses, say Rittenhouse is not a member. But according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Rittenhouse identifies with such groups.\n\"People are getting injured and our job is to protect this business,\" Rittenhouse said in a video interview that night with The Daily Caller. \"And my job also is to protect people. If someone is hurt, I\u2019m running into harm\u2019s way. That\u2019s why I have my rifle; I\u2019ve gotta protect myself, obviously. But I also have my med kit.\"\nBefore it was taken down, Rittenhouse\u2019s Facebook page showed several pro-police photos, including one that featured the phrase, \"Blue lives matter.\"\u00a0\nThree of the four news reports cited by Moore\u2019s office do not reference white supremacy or extremism. And the only one that does, an Aug. 27, 2020 article from CBS News, cites the Anti-Defamation League as saying Rittenhouse does not appear to be involved with any extremist movements.\nOren Segal, vice president of the Anti-Defamation League\u2019s Center on Extremism, echoed that in an interview with PolitiFact Wisconsin. Based on a review of Rittenhouse\u2019s TikTok, Facebook and Instagram accounts, Segal said, the organization has not found evidence linking Rittenhouse to white supremacist groups.\nSegal noted that Rittenhouse appears to embrace the Blue Lives Matter movement, which backs police officers and was created in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement. Segal said Blue Lives Matter is supported by some extremist groups, but also by many other people.\u00a0\nHe contends misidentifying someone as a white supremacist can amount to \"crying wolf\" and minimize the seriousness of extremist beliefs and behaviors.\n\"We need to really be sober about what we are seeing, and we need to tackle it with some honesty and not just fall prey to inaccurate, perhaps politically expedient categorizations,\" Segal said.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nIn a tweet, Moore said in contrast to how a Black man who was shot by police was treated, Kenosha police officers \"let an armed white supremacist walk right past them after shooting people.\"\nKenosha police did let Rittenhouse walk by and ultimately return home to Illinois after prosecutors say he killed two protesters and injured a third.\u00a0\nBut social media posts and profiles haven\u2019t revealed any evidence linking him to white supremacist groups, according to a key organization that tracks extremist activity.\u00a0\nA statement is Half True when it\u2019s partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.\nThat fits here.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18850"}
