Congressman to Trump and QAnon", "text": "House Democrats are trying to hang the QAnon label around the necks of as many Republicans as possible.\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene gave Democrats their moment. The Georgia Republican has praised QAnon and its baseless premise that former President Donald Trump was secretly battling a global cabal of Satan-worshiping pedophiles.\nAs House Republicans tangled over how to deal with Greene, Democratic leaders kept QAnon front and center.\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi referred to Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy in a press release as \"Q-Calif.,\" in place of the conventional \"R-Calif.\"\nWhen Republicans declined to strip Greene of her committee assignments, Democrats (along with 11 Republicans) broke with precedent and voted to remove her themselves.\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee unveiled what it called the first ads in the 2022 midterm elections. It targeted seven Republicans, along with McCarthy, as \"too weak to stand up to President Trump and the QAnon mob.\"\nRep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., was on the DCCC\u2019s list. The ad featured shots of the mob, many under the QAnon banner, attacking the Capitol.\n\"Republicans like Brian Fitzpatrick voted to protect Trump letting the QAnon mob win,\" the Feb. 2 ad said. \"Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick should have stood with us, but he was a coward. He stood with Trump and the lies. Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick. He stood with Q, not you.\"\nFitzpatrick won reelection easily in a largely suburban district outside Philadelphia. But Joe Biden carried it with 53% of the vote, a possible reason for Democrats to target the seat.\nThe ad\u2019s core accuracy problem is that while Fitzpatrick in January voted against impeaching Trump, he introduced a resolution to censure the then-president. Months prior, he condemned the QAnon theory in a resolution that won bipartisan support.\nHouse resolution condemning QAnon\nIn September 2020, Fitzpatrick joined two Democrats and two Republicans to cosponsor a House resolution that rejected QAnon and all it stood for. It condemned QAnon for spreading its unfounded belief in a pedophilia ring, and for how it \"expanded to embrace virtually every popular conspiracy theory of the last several decades, from questioning the truth about the September 11th terrorist attacks, to believing in alien landings, to denying the safety of vaccines.\"\nThe resolution noted that the FBI had determined that QAnon likely motivated domestic terrorists. It said QAnon beliefs \"undermine trust in America\u2019s democratic institutions, encourage rejection of objective reality, and deepen our Nation\u2019s political polarization.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJake Tapper\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in remarks in a CNN broadcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second presidential impeachment of Donald Trump was \u201cthe most bipartisan impeachment in American history.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe measure passed Oct. 2 on a 371-18 vote.\nCensure of Trump\nFitzpatrick did not support impeaching Trump for inciting the attack on the Capitol. He said impeachment would throttle any hope of unity to help the nation deal with its problem.\nBut he did press for a resolution that would put Congress on record as condemning \"his reprehensible conduct which led to the riots at our nation\u2019s Capitol.\"\nThe resolution blamed Trump for his false claim that \u2018\u2018we won this election, and we won it by a landslide.\" It said Trump\u2019s words \"encouraged \u2014 and foreseeably resulted in \u2014 lawless action at the Capitol.\" It said Trump had betrayed his trust as president, and \"threatened the integrity of the democratic system, interfered with the peaceful transition of power, and imperiled a coequal branch of Government.\"\nFitzpatrick offered the resolution along with six other Republican members, but the measure went no further.\nImpeachment vote\nFitzpatrick voted against impeachment. Whatever his reason, the vote strengthened Trump\u2019s hand. For the DCCC, this vote was telling.\n\"Congressman Fitzpatrick had an opportunity to join 10 of his Republican colleagues and vote for the bipartisan articles of impeachment that held President Trump accountable,\" said DCCC communications director Cole Leitner. \"Instead he caved to his president, and now he owns that vote.\"\nLeiter argued that Fitzpatrick\u2019s actions calling for opposition to QAnon and censure of Trump don\u2019t carry the same weight as impeachment. The condemnation of QAnon was non-binding, and the censure of Trump was stillborn, he said. By contrast, the impeachment vote was a binding resolution of constitutional importance.\nWe reached out to Fitzpatrick\u2019s office and did not hear back.\nOur ruling\nA Democratic ad said Fitzpatrick \"stood with Trump and the lies\u2026 He stood with QAnon, not you.\"\u00a0\nFitzpatrick\u2019s vote against impeachment carried the most legal heft of any of his actions. Regardless of whether Fitzpatrick saw it as supporting Trump, his vote fell on the plus side of the ledger for Trump.\u00a0\nBut Fitzpatrick publicly criticized Trump. He spoke against the lies of election fraud. He also publicly condemned QAnon.\nThe claim has an element of truth, but mistates other facts. We rate it Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19079"}
