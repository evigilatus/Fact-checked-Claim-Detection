In Africa, people walk to 300 miles to vote, and Senator GOP says,", "text": "The Republicans and Democrats of the Florida Senate argued on May 5, 2011, about the purpose of the major election reform, where Democrats said that the bill would suppress votes and Republicans opposed that it would help prevent fraud. HB 1355, which passed both rooms and now goes to Goff's office. Rick Scott, delete a provision four decades ago that allows voters who have moved or changed their family name to update their information in the polls on election day. These voters are required to submit provisional ballots which will be reviewed after the elections. The bill also requires groups of third parties, such as the Association of Women Voters, to register with the State and to deliver signed voter registration forms within 48 hours instead of the current 10 days. The Democrats argued that changes made voting more difficult. Mr. Mike Bennett from R. Braddenton said it was okay. Florida has made it too easy to vote, as he said during the debate, and people should be asked to make an effort to vote. \"We all want everyone to vote,\" he said. \"But we want an informed voter.\" The vote is a privilege, Bennett said, so how should it be easy? \"Do you read stories about people in Africa? People in the desert, who literally walk 200 miles so they can get a chance to do what we do, and we want to make it more appropriate? How much more comfortable do you want to make it? Do we want to go to their house? Take the polling booth with us? \"This is a cruel privilege. That's something people die for. Do you want to make it comfortable? The man who died to give you that right wasn't comfortable. Why are we making it easier? I want them to fight for it. I want them to know what it's like. I want them to go there, and they must walk across town to go there and vote.\" Are people in Africa really walking 200 to 300 miles to vote? To put that in perspective, we're talking about walking the distance between Talahasi and Biloxi, Miss, on Highway 10, or from Miami to Daytona Beach along I-95. We didn't have to go too far to find an answer. From 1 to 10 May, a group of African electoral experts and officials came to know the United States election process. We were able to contact them by telephone with the assistance of the Professor of Political Science at the University of Florida, Daniel A. Smith. Through the Foreign Ministry translator, we asked each of them whether people were going 200 to 300 miles to vote in Africa. We didn't have to wait for the translation. We heard the laughter. Mr. Alpha Faye, history and geology teacher in Senegal and election observer, said. Two kilometres (approximately 1.25 miles). Ms. Khadijto Sal, a Mauritanian social worker and election monitor, said that her country, like the United States, used public utilities as polling places - schools, medical clinics and other facilities in local villages. Ms. Hlaa Ahmed Talabana, also from Mauritania, said that major parties also provided transportation for voters to access the ballot boxes, a practice that was also common in the United States. \"No doubt, no one walks in the desert to vote,\" said our student. In Chad, a land-locked nation with a large desert in the north, the maximum distance you may have to walk is 5 kilometres (approximately 3.1 miles). Mr. Baidiso Sokolguy, a programme officer at the Chad office of the Electoral Institute for Sustainable Democracy, was added. In the Niger, up to 4 to 5 kilometres to the polling place or about 3 miles, Mr. Abdullah Isovo said. \"It's hard to vote here more than Niger,\" said Isovo. In fact, electoral officials have plans for nomadic Bedouins in the country - who move with their cattle to find water and land for grazing. None of the African electoral officials with whom we spoke heard of any case of a person walking 200 to 300 miles to vote. In fact, they wanted to know where Bennett got his information. We are, too. We examined news reports on the recent elections in Chad, Uganda, Nigeria and elsewhere and found no cases of people walking hundreds of miles to vote. There's no doubt about that: this claim is pants on fire! He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. \u2022 January 12, 2012", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13138"}
