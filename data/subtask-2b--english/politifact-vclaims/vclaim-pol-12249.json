Karger -- a gay Republican who has attracted little support in the polls -- suggested that, as president, Romney would face a conflict between the duties of his office and Mormon religion, also known as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints or LDS.\n\n\"My major concern with the Mormon faith is the basic tenet of obedience,\" Karger told the newspaper. \"If a President Romney got a call from the president of the LDS, he has no choice but to obey. It is obedience over family and country.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKarger's remarks brought to mind an earlier debate in 1960 over whether John F. Kennedy would put allegiance to the Pope first. Kennedy took those concerns head on in a Sept. 12, 1960, speech to the Greater Houston Ministerial Association and went on to win the election.\n\nTo make sure Karger wasn\u2019t misquoted, we contacted his campaign. Spokeswoman Rina Shah confirmed the authenticity of the quote. She also provided an additional statement from Karger.\n\n\"I have researched the LDS church and many of its beliefs over the past three years,\" Karger said in a statement to PolitiFact. \"Obedience is absolute. I have been told this in no uncertain terms by many Mormons and ex-Mormons. This life is merely a test of that. Look into the recent church campaign to get Switzerland to not ban LDS missionaries from its country.\"\n\n(Here is a statement by the church and some of the news coverage of the dispute with Switzerland.)\n\nSo is Karger\u2019s claim that Romney would have to obey church over state accurate?\n\nFirst, we\u2019ll note that the church takes up this issue explicitly on its website.\n\n\"The church\u2019s mission is to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ, not to elect politicians,\" the site says. \"The church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is neutral in matters of party politics. This applies in all of the many nations in which it is established.\"\n\nThe statement goes on to say that \"the church does not \u2026 attempt to direct or dictate to a government leader.\" It adds, \"Elected officials who are Latter-day Saints make their own decisions and may not necessarily be in agreement with one another or even with a publicly stated church position. While the church may communicate its views to them, as it may to any other elected official, it recognizes that these officials still must make their own choices based on their best judgment and with consideration of the constituencies whom they were elected to represent.\"\n\nWhen we contacted the LDS church, spokesman Lyman Kirkland had a one-sentence reply: \"Mr. Karger\u2019s assertions are simply ridiculous.\"\n\nWe also reached three scholars of Mormon theology and history, and all agreed that Karger\u2019s concerns were misplaced. Here are some of their reactions to Karger\u2019s statement.\n\nTerryl Givens, professor of literature and religion at the University of Richmond and author of such books as People of Paradox: A History of Mormon Culture and By the Hand of Mormon: The American Scripture that Launched a New World Religion:\n\n\"There is no basis in fact for the claim that Romney would have \u2018no choice but to obey\u2019 if he got a call from the LDS church president. On the rare occasion when church presidents make pronouncements on issues with political implications, such as a statement against abortion, or against the MX missile system, church members are free to act in compliance or in disregard for such pronouncements. No member has been disciplined for his or her political conduct, as the distribution of both Mormon voters and politicians across the political spectrum proves.\"\n\nLaurie Maffly-Kipp, adjunct professor of American studies at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and author of Proclamation to the People: 19th Century Mormonism and the Pacific Basin Frontier:\n\n\"It is his own interpretation of what Mormons do, not a policy or doctrine in the church. Members are always reminded that the dictates of their own conscience are paramount. A good example of this was when Mitt Romney's father, George, as governor of Michigan in 1964, supported the passage of a civil rights bill even when leaders in the LDS church wrote to him advising against it. As the church elder admitted in the letter he wrote to Gov. Romney, \u2018I cannot deny you the right of your position if it represents your true belief and feelings.\u2019 \"(The letter is available here.)\n\nGrant Hardy, professor of history and religious studies at the University of North Carolina (Asheville) and author of Understanding the Book of Mormon: A Reader's Guide:\n\n\"The statement attributed to Fred Karger is not true. \u2026 Mr. Karger's quote may come from a misunderstanding of the LDS temple. Mormon temples are only open to members of the church who have a current temple \u2018recommend,\u2019 and one of the questions that must be answered positively to receive a recommend is, \u2018Do you sustain the President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as the prophet, seer, and revelator, and as the only person on earth who possesses and is authorized to exercise all priesthood keys?\u2019 But the word \u2018sustain\u2019 does not mean \u2018obey\u2019 or even \u2018agree with in every particular.\u2019 There is a long tradition in Mormonism of valuing agency and individual conscience. Similarly, in the temple ceremony itself, Latter-day Saints make a covenant of obedience, but it is obedience to God rather than obedience to the prophet or to the church.\n\n\"So if a President Romney got a call from the president of the LDS church -- which I don't think would ever happen -- he would not be required by the tenets of his faith to put obedience to the church over his duty to his country or his office.\"\n\nHardy offered as an example the battle over Proposition 8 -- a California ballot initiative that barred same-sex marriage in the state. It passed with 52 percent of the vote in 2008, thanks in part to the strong support of the Mormon church.\n\n\"The church was strongly involved in their vocal support of Proposition 8,\" Hardy said. \"A majority of active members responded to the church's call to action, but those who did not, or who opposed the measure, remain Latter-day Saints in good standing.\" (Karger was the founder of Californians Against Hate -- an opponent of Proposition 8. In that capacity, he \"led four boycotts and filed formal ethics violation complaints leading to investigations of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,\" according to Karger\u2019s resume.)\n\nOur ruling\n\nWe don't see any evidence that Karger is correct that \"if a President Romney got a call from the president of the (Mormon church), he has no choice but to obey. It is obedience over family and country.\" The church itself says in no uncertain terms that that\u2019s not the case, and three scholars of the religion agree. The inflammatory nature of Karger\u2019s charge rates it a Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-12249"}
