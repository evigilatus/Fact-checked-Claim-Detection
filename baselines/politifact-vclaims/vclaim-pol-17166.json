The 10th is one of a group of toss-up races we are tracking ahead of the Nov. 3 election.\nDePasquale runs the state\u2019s Auditor General Office, the agency that keeps an eye on how the state spends its money. As Pennsylvania\u2019s bean counter in chief, DePasquale waved a red flag when President Donald Trump announced that he was deferring workers\u2019 Social Security payroll tax for a few months.\n\"The President\u2019s temporary payroll tax holiday \u2026 could leave American workers liable for thousands of dollars during tax season and could potentially leave programs like Social Security and Medicare weakened \u2014 or worse,\" DePasquale tweeted Aug. 8.\n2/4: I strongly disagree however with the President\u2019s temporary payroll tax holiday which could leave American workers liable for thousands of dollars during tax season and could potentially leave programs like Social Security and Medicare weakened - or worse.\u2014 Eugene DePasquale (@DePasqualePA) August 9, 2020 \nTrump\u2019s announcement left some big questions, such as whether workers would still be on the hook for the payroll tax. DePasquale\u2019s carefully worded tweet left room for the uncertainty of the moment.\nTrump\u2019s action\nTrump issued a memo that told employers they didn\u2019t need to send Washington the 6.2% out of each employee\u2019s paycheck that helps fund Social Security. So, someone making $1,000 a week \u2014 the national median pay \u2014 could see an extra $62 every week. The tax break applies to people making up to $2,000 a week and would be in place for four months, September through December.\nThe more a person makes, up to the maximum, the more money they would keep. At the high end, a person could see a tax cut of $1,984 over those 16 weeks. That\u2019s pretty close to DePasquale\u2019s \"thousands of dollars.\"\nTrump had the power to defer collecting the tax, but as written, his order provided only temporary relief. At some point, the missed payments would need to be made up or count as foregone revenues to the Social Security trust fund. The memo said the administration will look for a way to let people keep the money, but that decision rests with Congress, not the president.\nThe future of the payroll tax\nTrump announced the tax deferral after negotiations with Congress to pass another coronavirus economic relief package broke down.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPat Toomey\n\n\nstated on January 19, 2021 in a hearing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere will be several thousand dollars in payments going to families with six-figure incomes who\u2019ve had no income interruption whatsoever.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jessica Calefati \u2022 January 21, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen he rolled out the payroll tax holiday, Trump said something that portended a much bigger move \u2014 canceling the payroll tax altogether, pending the outcome in November.\n\"If I win, I may extend and terminate,\" Trump said. \"In other words, I\u2019ll extend it beyond the end of the year and terminate the tax.\"\nTrump\u2019s meaning was ambiguous. Later that day, a campaign legal adviser tweeted that he meant full elimination of the payroll tax. Taken literally, that would mean a loss of over $1 trillion for the two main programs funded by payroll taxes: over $900 billion for Social Security and over $275 billion for Medicare.\u00a0\nBoth employers and employees pay the payroll tax, and it was possible that Trump was referring only to the worker portion or, for that matter, only to the Social Security portion, or only to the workers under the $2,000-a-week income threshold. Or he may have meant eliminating the payroll tax entirely.\nDePasquale sent his tweet on Aug. 8. Over the next week, in a ping-pong pattern, Trump would repeat his desire to fully eliminate the payroll tax, and top administration officials would say he didn\u2019t mean that. That back and forth took place after DePasquale\u2019s tweet, so it plays no role in this fact-check.\nOur ruling\nOn the day that Trump announced a temporary deferral of employees\u2019 Social Security payroll taxes, DePasquale said that the move could cost people thousands of dollars during next year\u2019s tax season and could potentially threaten Social Security and Medicare.\nDePasquale\u2019s dollar estimate of the deferred tax liability fits for the highest-paid workers affected by Trump\u2019s plan, but those making less would see a smaller impact. He was correct that the repayment of the tax was an open question.\nHe was also correct that, taken at full face value, Trump\u2019s words described a plan that would undermine the finances for Social Security and Medicare. Congress would have the final say, and Trump\u2019s meaning was ambiguous.\nBut DePasquale bracketed his concerns with the words \"could\" and \"potentially could.\"\nDePasquale gave due regard to the uncertainties, but his dollar estimate applied only to the best-paid workers.
