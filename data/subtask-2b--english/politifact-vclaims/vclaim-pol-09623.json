Dan Ramos says top earners would pay less and middle-class families would pay more under governor\u2019s budget proposal", "text": "Gov. John Kasich\u2019s proposed tax overhaul would affect the pocketbooks of all Ohioans \u2013 whether for good or for ill is a source of disagreement among state lawmakers.\n\nThe Republican governor\u2019s plan aims to reduce income taxes for all Ohioans by 20 percent, shave down sales tax to 5 percent while broadening the sales-tax base to include previously tax-exempt services, and slash in half taxes on most small-business income. Kasich also wants to reform oil and gas severance taxes.\n\nThe tax plan is drummed up by Kasich\u2019s administration as a victory for all Ohio taxpayers. But Rep. Dan Ramos, a Lorain Democrat, is among those who liken the budget proposal to a shell game only Ohio\u2019s upper crust can win.\n\n\"Under [Kasich\u2019s] plan, the top one percent in Ohio will pay $10,000 less in income tax each year, but Ohio\u2019s working and middle class families will pay more,\" Ramos said Feb. 19 in a written statement.\n\nPolitiFact Ohio decided to audit the representative\u2019s numbers.\n\nRamos\u2019 office said the assertion draws from a study released by left-leaning think tank Policy Matters Ohio, which cites calculations by the Washington-based Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.\n\nThe numbers released in February by ITEP show that the top one percent of Ohio taxpayers, with a mean income above $335,000, would save an average of $10,369 each year. Ohioans earning less than $18,000 would, on average, pay an additional $63 in taxes.\n\nITEP further asserts that Kasich\u2019s proposed tax reform would typically result in a net loss for Ohioans making up to $51,000 each year.\n\nBut how did ITEP get its numbers?\n\nThe non-profit said it uses an elaborate microsimulation tax model that calculates the impact of changes to current tax law at the federal and state level. \u00a0Among the stratified data used in the model are a large sample of federal tax returns, Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Expenditure Surveys and Census Bureau American Community Surveys, they said.\n\nThe New York Times has lauded the credibility of the model and Bloomberg has used the model\u2019s calculations as reporting tools.\n\nFor Ohio, ITEP factored Kasich\u2019s proposed tax revamps \u2013 minus his severance tax plan \u2013 into its calculations and delivered its findings to Policy Matters Ohio.\n\nThat\u2019s where Ramos picked up the figures and used them in his argument that Kasich\u2019s plan would \"shift the burden of taxes from the shoulders of those who have to the shoulders of those who have not.\" And Ramos is mostly correct.\n\nThe numbers are credible, but Ramos\u2019s statement implies that every working and middle-class family would pay more under the reform.\n\nAccording to the ITEP numbers, 20 percent of Ohioans earn between $51,000 and $78,000 per year, and would begin to see an average yearly savings of about $75. The line between middle- and upper-class incomes is up for debate \u2013 not one to be defined absolutely by PolitiFact Ohio \u2013 but it\u2019s safe to say that a yearly income of $51,000 is a far cry from upper-class. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nRamos was correct in describing the tax benefit to Ohioans with the highest incomes, but he wrongly implied that all working and middle-class families would take a hit under Kasich\u2019s plan. For that, we rate his statement Half True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09623"}
