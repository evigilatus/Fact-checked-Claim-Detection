Thompson said yes.\n\nMercure then asked: \"What do you say to those critics that say that you're not?\"\n\nCue the riff.\n\n\"Ninety-one times I cut taxes; 91 times,\" Thompson replied. \"Three times, income taxes. Eliminated the inheritance taxes, eliminated the gift taxes. Gave the people of this state $2.1 billion in property tax (relief) -- and never raised taxes. If you want a conservative, follow me.\"\n\nWe\u2019ve rated Mostly True Thompson\u2019s claim that Wisconsin\u2019s overall tax burden went down while he served as governor from 1987 to 2001.\n\nAs we said in that item, tax burden is a broad measure:\n\n\"Tax burden\" takes those total collections -- including property, income, sales, corporate and other taxes -- \u00a0and divides them into all personal income earned in the state. \u00a0It does not reflect what every individual experienced; it\u2019s a composite measure of the composite statewide tax bite, or burden. The \"burden\" measurement is considered the gold standard for measuring tax impact.\n\nBut in saying he never raised any taxes, Thompson raised the bar awfully high, so we decided to take a look.\n\nDarrin Schmitz, Thompson\u2019s campaign spokesman, told us Thompson \"was referring to Wisconsin\u2019s general taxes: income, sales, property and corporate taxes.\"\n\nBut that\u2019s an attempt to lower the bar.\n\nThompson did not qualify the statement when he made it. In fact, he listed a variety of taxes.\n\nWith a little research we found examples of taxes Thompson raised -- including some of the ones his campaign mentioned as not being raised.\n\nGeneral taxes: The 1995-1997 state budget contained $63 million in tax increases -- including boosts in the general tax increases Thompson cited, according to the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the neutral scorekeeper that tallies tax hikes and tax cuts. The budget projected an increase of $17.5 million in sales tax revenue over the two-year period by eliminating an exemption for certain office equipment. And eliminating an exemption for certain health care providers raised corporate income taxes by a projected $900,000.\n\n(That budget also raised fees by $120 million over two years.)\n\nThe 1997-1999 budget contained $125 million in tax increases, the fiscal bureau said. That included an increase of $36 million in sales tax revenue over two years by imposing a \"use tax\" on catalog sales.\n\nCigarettes: The cigarette tax was 25 cents per pack when Thompson took office. It was raised four times during his tenure and was 59 cents when he left to join President George W. Bush\u2019s administration. (The tax is now $2.52.)\n\nGasoline: The gas tax rose to 18 cents per gallon shortly after Thompson took office, based on a law adopted before he took office, and rose by more than 8 cents to 26.4 cents before he left. (It\u2019s now 30.9 cents.)\n\nTwelve of the 14 gas-tax increases under Thompson were automatic annual adjustments, which occurred because of the previous law. But Thompson did not take action to stop the automatic increases and two of the increases -- which totaled 3 of the 8 cents -- were raised by budgets adopted during his tenure. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThat\u2019s not an exhaustive list, but it provides enough for the claim at hand.\n\nOur rating\n\nThompson stated flatly that as governor, he \"never raised taxes.\" Thompson has a long list of taxes he cut and, on balance, he can claim to have reduced taxes. But he also raised some specific taxes along the way.\n\nWe rate his statement False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11625"}
