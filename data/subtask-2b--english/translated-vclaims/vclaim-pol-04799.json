In a speech from New York, he called her a \"world class liar,\" who \"spend her whole life.\" Trump has given a broad aspect of Clinton's immigration policies - for him he represents \"collective amnesty\" and \"open borders\" - and he has confused those shortcomings with her refugee plans. Trump said: \"Hilary also wants to spend hundreds of billions to resettle Middle Eastern refugees in the United States, at the highest standard level of migration.\" \"For the amount of money Hillary Clinton wants to spend on refugees, we can rebuild every inner city in America.\" We asked Trump where he got the spending figures and he didn't answer them. However, as you can see, the number of Clintons that can be envisaged to spend the resettlement of refugees is not very close to the cost of rebuilding urban centres in America. The only figures we found for Clinton &apos; s budget plans were $15 million for immigrant integration services (from its campaign website) and $582 million for the resettlement of 70,000 refugees. The second figure comes from an analysis of federal expenditure on refugees by the non-partisan National Congress of state legislatures. We used that as one starting point. President Barack Obama seeks to increase the number of refugees admitted from all over the world to 100,000. This includes 10,000 Syrian refugees. Clinton said she wanted to arrest 65,000 Syrians. If we add its highest number to Obama and assume that it will not diminish its plan, we can estimate the total number of refugees at 155,000. To raise the dollar, we can almost estimate the total cost of its plan at about $1.3 billion. This is about half a percent of the \"hundreds of billions\" called Trump. We have also considered the Obama Administration &apos; s budget request for fiscal year 2017 to assist refugees and participants. This is just under $2.2 billion for 100,000 refugees. When additional costs are added to more resettled Syrian refugees, you may receive a budget in the neighbourhood from $3 billion to $4 billion. The cost of rebuilding inner cities was used as a term that generally refers to low-income urban neighbourhoods. It's not clear what he meant by rebuilding them. This could include the reconstruction of substandard housing, the rehabilitation of old water systems, investment in schools and job training, the creation of a attractive business environment, or any number of aspects of life lacking in low-income communities. Solomon Green, Senior Fellow of the Urban Institute, an academic centre in Washington, told us that he did not know any comprehensive study that added the rehabilitation needs of every American city. However, he noted that only $26 billion was accumulated to repair public housing in the country. \"It's a very conservative estimate,\" said Green. \"Including only public housing, this is a small share of the low-income housing stock.\" The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 On January 11, 2012, not all public housing in urban centres was, but Green, a housing specialist, told us that the vast majority of housing existed. The city of New York alone could use billions of dollars for improvements. The Centre for the Urban Future, a research and policy group supported by financiers ranging from Metlaev to the Child Welfare Fund, estimated that the rehabilitation of old age infrastructure in the large apple would cost about $47 billion over five years. Researchers at the Lincoln Land Policy Institute, a research centre for urban planning in Cambridge, Mass., found a number of estimates of different urban needs. The Federal Transit Administration estimated in 2013 that it would cost $85.9 billion to bring the country &apos; s transit systems to a good state of repair. The Grand City School Board said that the needs for school facilities in the 50 largest cities would cost $85 billion. The director of the Institute, George McCarthy, estimated that it would only cost $975 million to destroy abandoned buildings in Detroit. We can go further, but the numbers are clear. We barely scratch the surface of U.S. cities' needs, and we find a price of over $225 billion. Even if Clinton doubled funding for the Obama Refugee Administration, money would have little impact. The Governor Trump said that Clinton wanted to spend hundreds of billions on refugees and for that money, \"We can rebuild every inner city in America.\" The Trump campaign did not provide any supporting numbers. Clinton did not say how much it would spend on refugees, but the Obama administration's request for fiscal year 2017 is about $2.2 billion. This figure could increase for Clinton, as she said she wanted to receive more Syrian refugees. If you multiply or triple, you will not approach \"hundreds of billions.\" It is also a small part of the price for rebuilding internal cities in America. There is no comprehensive calculation of what it takes to deal with housing and infrastructure below the required level, but we soon found a backlog of projects of about $225 billion. Trump's numbers are out of range. We're assessing this pants claim on fire. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/939f9175-5c91-4f06-aeae-8ac8af38c08", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04799"}
