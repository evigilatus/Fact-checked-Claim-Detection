One suggested the woman pictured also looks like \"the alleged mother of the girl supposedly killed in Charlottesville.\" Another placed her \"at the Boston Marathon, at the Levoy Finnicum standoff in Oregon, and at Sandy Hook.\"\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

They all have wavy brown hair and glasses, but they do not look identical. And searching for other photos of the women, ones in which they aren\u2019t under duress and in some cases not wearing glasses, the differences are even more acute.\nLeinonen has been in the public eye since the shooting, speaking at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, for example. Lambourne appeared on \"Deal or No Deal.\"\nAll three women are different individuals who have experienced gun violence up close.\nWe rate this Facebook post Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00274"}
