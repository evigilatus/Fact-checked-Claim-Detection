It was called D.A.R.E.\u00a0\u2014 Drug Abuse Resistance Education \u2014 and its lessons were led by police officers who visited classrooms to teach kids how to resist drugs and violence. Perhaps you were visited by such an officer or the program\u2019s Daren the Lion mascot.\nA May 24 Facebook post has reimagined Daren just saying yes to drugs. Above a photo of the lion with a joint in his mouth are these words: \"D.A.R.E. removed cannabis from its list of gateway drugs.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We called D.A.R.E. to ask about it.\nRichard Mahan, the organization\u2019s chief operating officer, told us that years ago, D.A.R.E. listed substances that \"youth might experiment with,\" including nicotine and marijuana. But he said D.A.R.E. has never listed so-called \"gateway drugs,\" nor removed cannabis from such a list.\nBut back in 2016, some news outlets reported that D.A.R.E. had delisted cannabis as a gateway drug. The headline on a February 2016 Teen Vogue story, for example, said, \"It\u2019s official: marijuana is no longer a gateway drug.\"\nThe story says that a Reddit user \"noticed that mysteriously, marijuana was no longer listed among D.A.R.E\u2019s other, arguably more harmful counterparts of tobacco and alcohol.\" The Reddit post links to a dead page, but the url says: dare.org/keeping-kids-drug-free/.\nUsing the Wayback Machine, which takes snapshots of web pages over time, we were able to find archived versions of when the web address worked. The earliest is from Aug. 14, 2013.\n\"What is a gateway drug?\" the site asks in bold near the top of the page. \"A gateway drug is a drug that opens the door to the use of other, harder drugs. Gateway drugs are typically inexpensive and readily available.\"\nThe page includes sections on the dangers of tobacco and alcohol, but not cannabis. The only mention of marijuana is in the tobacco section. According to a federal report, the page says, \"tobacco use is associated with alcohol and illicit drug use and is generally the first drug used by young people who enter a sequence of drug use that can include tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, and harder drugs.\"\nWe asked Mahan about the page and he pushed back on the idea that it \"lists\" gateway drugs.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think the way it reads is it says there is the potential for leading to the use of other drugs, and yes, I know the word \u2018gateway\u2019 is in there,\" he said. He noted that the page has been removed, and he said the D.A.R.E. curriculum today doesn\u2019t teach about \"gateway drugs,\" for which he said there\u2019s no single definition.\nMahan also said he doesn\u2019t know if cannabis was ever highlighted on the page like tobacco and alcohol were. If it was, \"there was no conscious decision to remove it.\"\nFrank Pegueros, D.A.R.E.\u2019s chief executive officer, offered this explanation about the \"gateway drug\" page to Forbes in March 2016. The confusion, he said, is \"based on what appears to have been a partial posting of a document on our website.\"\nThat part that was posted discussed alcohol and tobacco as gateway drugs, Forbes reported. Another part discussing marijuana as a gateway drug was on a subsequent page that wasn\u2019t posted.\n\"It\u2019s obvious from looking at the document that the entire document was not in fact posted, because it only addressed tobacco and alcohol,\" Pegueros told Forbes. \"It didn\u2019t address marijuana or inhalants, the typical substances considered to be gateway drugs.\"\nEarlier that year, D.A.R.E. responded to reports that it had changed its position on marijuana.\n\"Had nominal research been conducted by the author(s) substantial reference on the D.A.R.E. website would have been found in support of D.A.R.E.\u2019s position that marijuana is both an illegal and harmful drug to the youth of this nation,\" the post says. \"D.A.R.E. considers marijuana to be a dangerous drug for youth of the United States and the world!\"\nMahan said this later Feb. 2, 2018, post on the D.A.R.E. website reflects the organization\u2019s position on marijuana, including the answer to the question: \"What is D.A.R.E.\u2019s position on marijuana as a gateway drug?\" The post continues:\n\"After decades of studies, the research is still inconclusive regarding whether or not marijuana is a gateway drug and, if so, what other variables may contribute to an individual who has repeatedly used marijuana being drawn to experiment or use other types of illicit drugs. D.A.R.E.\u2019s curricula focus on providing students with the knowledge, skills, and tools to make decisions for safe and healthy living and the avoidance of high risk behaviors. Without question, a student\u2019s use of marijuana is a high risk behavior with unhealthy consequences.\"\nOur ruling\nThe Facebook post says that \"D.A.R.E. removed cannabis from its list of gateway drugs.\" That claim seems to stem from a 2016 Reddit post about a page on D.A.R.E.\u2019s website discussing gateways. The page has since been removed, but an archived snapshot of the website reveals that cannabis was not given the same attention as tobacco and alcohol.\nThe problem is that cached versions of the page from as early as 2013 also don\u2019t highlight marijuana as a gateway drug. Though it\u2019s unclear if cannabis ever appeared on the page, D.A.R.E. says it was not removed from any gateway drug list and today it still considers marijuana a dangerous drug for youth.\nWe rate this Facebook post False.\n Share the Facts 2019-05-30 17:21:03 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  \"D.A.R.E. removed cannabis from its list of gateway drugs.\"    Viral image On the internet     Monday, May 20, 2019 2019-05-20    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00584"}
