Adam Schiff paid witnesses more than $40 million to testify in the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump.\nThe hoax originated on a satirical website but was lifted by another website called \"Today Breaking News.\"\nThe article\u2019s headline (the only part of the story that users can see on Facebook) reads: \"Adam Schiff Paid Witnesses Over $40 Million To Testify Against Trump.\"\nThe story was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on\u00a0its News Feed.

A satire or parody disclaimer could not be found on the website.\nWe found the same fabricated story on two other sites that similarly do not contain satirical disclaimers. One uses a different photograph of Schiff that doesn\u2019t have a logo, and the other has the logo covered with additional text.\nWe rate it Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17606"}
