I don\u2019t think we would have made it, but for some reason it was made. But we\u2019ve undone that decision.\"\nWhen reporters asked, the White House pointed to a February Food and Drug Administration policy that relaxed the rules on tests for coronavirus developed in labs. The change allowed labs to start using \"COVID-19 diagnostics\" while they are waiting for the FDA to approve their testing procedure. The FDA laid out specific steps for labs to follow to show that their method for spotting the virus held up under scrutiny.\nThe change applied only to labs that met the highest standard, those that are \"certified to perform high-complexity testing.\"\nThe FDA\u2019s policies here go back many years and fall under the umbrella of Emergency Use Authorization, a fast-track for deploying medical help when time was of the essence and waiting for the normal approval process made no sense.\nOverall Emergency Use Authorization\nThe FDA has general guidance for using medical treatments that haven\u2019t gone through the usual clearance process. Emergency Use Authorization dates back to 2004 during the administration of George W. Bush.\u00a0\nAs part of American counterterrorism policy, Congress passed the Project BioShield Act of 2004. It allowed the FDA to issue Emergency Use Authorizations so diagnostic tests and treatments could be shared faster during a health emergency. The law was extended in 2006 and reauthorized in 2013.\nBasically, a lab or a drug maker could tell the FDA it had a promising approach, apply for an emergency authorization, and the FDA would move as quickly as possible to approve or disapprove the proposal.\nThe FDA has a lot of flexibility in how it oversees these emergency authorizations. It issues guidance, not to be confused with hard and fast regulations. The guidance from the FDA in 2007, before Obama took office, is very similar to the one in 2017 at the very end of the Obama administration.\nBoth stress the need for speed and encourage labs to start talking to the FDA as early as possible before they submit their application to reduce the turnaround time. The FDA lays out what it wants to see in an application, but in case a lab can\u2019t provide that in \"a timely manner,\" the FDA \"will accept and evaluate the request for an EUA based on data in the form the sponsor is able to submit,\" according to the 2017 guidance.\n\"They could turn them around in a day or two, depending on how similar it was to an existing use,\" said Alta Charo, professor of law at the University of Wisconsin and an advisor to the FDA in the first two years of the Obama administration.\nLaboratory Developed Tests\nThere\u2019s a second, narrower track. It has to do with a subset of the Emergency Use Authorization that applies to what are called Laboratory Developed Tests. Those are tests used in individual labs, and the FDA policy has been that these tests \"should not be used for clinical diagnoses without FDA\u2019s approval, clearance, or authorization during an emergency declaration.\"\u00a0\nBut the FDA\u2019s authority over those Laboratory Developed Tests was always in a legal gray zone.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPat Toomey\n\n\nstated on January 19, 2021 in a hearing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere will be several thousand dollars in payments going to families with six-figure incomes who\u2019ve had no income interruption whatsoever.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jessica Calefati \u2022 January 21, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This was not legally binding,\" said University of Missouri law professor Erika Lietzan. \"The FDA never had clear jurisdiction, and the people working at the FDA never enforced the policy. The whole thing is just a recommendation.\"\nThat is the policy the Trump administration modified. These labs need to apply, but they can start using their tests before they get the green light from the FDA.\n\"They could have rolled the policy back further,\" Lietzan said. \"They still want the labs to apply.\"\nThere was no change in policy regarding these labs under the Obama administration.\n\"Trump\u2019s statement on this has been puzzling,\" said Jeff Gibbs, an attorney who focuses on FDA law and represents many labs. \"FDA has had a long-standing policy of generally not regulating Laboratory Developed Tests, but reserved the right to regulate them under certain circumstances.\"\nGibbs said that policy goes back to 1997, pre-dating the post-9/11 laws, and hasn\u2019t changed since. In 2006, the FDA issued guidance for emergency humanitarian use of diagnostic tests. It offered conditional approval for up to one year.\nThe Obama administration followed that policy, but in 2010, it signaled that it wanted to affirm the FDA\u2019s authority.\nThe FDA began a long process of adding new guidelines for these labs. It offered a draft version in 2014, but in November 2016, it said the effort had ended, and the new guidelines never took effect.\nThere was no change of policy under Obama.\nWe reached out to the White House and did not hear back.\nOur ruling\nTrump said the Obama administration made a decision that \"turned out to be very bad\" for detecting the COVID-19 virus.\nThe White House pointed to a new FDA policy that made it easier for labs to use their own methods to detect the COVID-19 virus. But the FDA never had firm legal authority over those labs.\u00a0\nThe new policy still asks labs to apply for Emergency Use Authorization. The shift is that once they apply, they can get to work before getting the nod from the FDA.\nThe policy that had been in place had its roots in guidance that dates to at least 2007, and before that, to a 2004 law, before Obama took office.\nWe rate this claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18063"}
