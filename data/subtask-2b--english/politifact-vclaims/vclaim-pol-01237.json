(In fact, scientists say they are the main contributor.)\nShe argued the issue of climate change is subject to \"hysteria\" and said certain weather phenomena, like periods of global cooling, are overlooked by the mainstream media narrative.\n\"We need to also recognize that we just had two of the coldest years, biggest drop in global temperatures that we have had since the 1980s, the biggest in the last 100 years,\" Pletka said during a panel discussion. \"We don't talk about that because it's not part of the agenda.\"\nClimate scientists told us that part of Pletka\u2019s claim is false and part is misleading.\n\u2018Two of the coldest years\u2019\nPletka said we just had two of the coldest years on record. That\u2019s wrong.\nGavin Schmidt, a climatologist and director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, pointed us to a chart of NASA data showing global average temperatures over time:\n\nThe far-right dots represent the global temperatures of 2017 and 2016. According to this data, they are actually some of the warmest years on record \u2014 which contradicts this portion of Pletka\u2019s claim.\nWe\u2019d note that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which has a slightly different way of calculating temperature, shows 2016 and 2015 as the warmest years on record.\nIn the United States, according to NASA data, 2017 and 2016 were the second- and third-warmest years.\n\n\u2018Biggest drop since the 1980s,\u2019 \u2018Biggest drop in the last 100 years\u2019\nThe other piece of Pletka\u2019s claim \u2014 about cold spells \u2014 was not so much false, as misleading.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShe told us she was relying on an article from Real Clear Markets with the headline, \"Did You Know the Greatest Two-Year Global Cooling Event Just Took Place?\"\nThe April 2018 article notes that from February 2016 to February 2018 (the latest month available at the time), global average temperatures dropped 0.56 degrees C.\n\"You have to go back to 1982-84 for the next biggest two-year drop,\" the article states, referring also to the NASA data on global average temperatures. (The 1982-84 drop was 0.47 degrees C.)\nClimate scientists told us this is technically true, but that it misses the bigger trend that\u2019s taken place over decades.\n\"Basically, it\u2019s just a statistical fluke that people have grabbed because it sounds good,\" Schmidt said. \"It has no relevance for the long-term trends.\" \u00a0\nThe drop in temperatures after 2016 was also unsurprising, climatologists said.\n2016 was especially hot because it was at the peak of the last El Ni\u00f1o, a recurring event when the surface of the Pacific Ocean warms, leading to higher global average temperatures of a few tenths of a degree. As the event concluded, things cooled off.\n\"So the subsequent drop in temperature isn't surprising,\" said Judith Curry, a climatologist and former chair of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology. \"A two-year trend is not meaningful in terms of understanding anything about how climate is changing.\"\nThe Real Clear article is ostensibly a critique of the mainstream media\u2019s failure to cover cold spells, which the author argues should garner as much coverage as heat waves and extreme weather phenomena linked to climate change. (\"None of this argues against global warming,\" the author states.)\nOur ruling\nPletka said, \"We just had two of the coldest years, biggest drop in global temperatures that we have had since the 1980s, the biggest in the last 100 years.\"\nHer claim that we just had two of the coldest years is wrong. Globally, 2016 and 2017 were the two warmest years on record, according to one measure.\nClimate scientists told us a two-year trend is meaningless in terms of understanding anything about how climate is changing.\nWith that in mind, Pletka\u2019s assertion that we\u2019ve recently seen the biggest drop in global temperatures is a red herring. It\u2019s based on a cherry-picked statistical fluke of no relevance, compared with long term trends.\nBottom line: Cold spells can and do happen, but they do not negate the fact that global warming is real and a legitimate cause for concern, according to broad scientific consensus.\nWe rate Pletka\u2019s claim False.\n Share the Facts 2018-11-29 16:35:25 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  \"We need to also recognize that we just had two of the coldest years, biggest drop in global temperatures that we have had since the 1980s, the biggest in the last 100 years.
