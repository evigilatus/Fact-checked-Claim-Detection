After I lost a legal battle, the city complied with Jove. The collective bargaining law of Scott Walker in 2011 will begin to deduct pension contributions from those workers who do not already do so. To help compensate for pension contributions, Barrett wants to give 3.9 percent increase to the city &apos; s public employees. The plan, with a $4.8 million price tag, will not apply to police and firefighters. They were exempted from the provisions of Law 10. City officials say that most firefighters and police pay little or nothing for their pensions and -- unlike most other city employees -- they can still negotiate and pay benefits. The East Side Councilman Nick Kovac said that Barrett's plan for increases seemed reasonable. On 30 September 2014, a television interview with Fox 6, Kovac addressed the differences between the different categories of city employees under Law 10. Police and fire officials \"Routinely get 4% increase annually while everyone gets a zero or 1% increase,\" said Kovac. \"This imbalance, the longer it lasts, will damage morale and make it harder and harder to manage the city in a fair manner.\" Four percent for nothing? Routinely? This has attracted our attention. On Facebook, a few firefighters pushed back on Kovac's claim, saying they hadn't seen an increase in two or three years. Nick, where do you get 4% a year? (a) A fire department officer was suspended. \"This isn't just a diversion, it's a mistake.\" What are the real numbers? When we asked Kovac for backup, he said he talked to the TV reporter. In doing so, he misspokes. After verifying the recent history of increases with the City Budget Office, Kovac said that he should not say \"routine\" or \"annual\" regarding an increase of 4% for police and fire. Maria Montegodo, Director of Personnel Relations in the City, sent us the basic increases in the wages of city employees to 1991. The percentage increase from 2010 to the present is as follows. :: Trade unions have ratified the 2010-2012 contracts after Act No. 10 entered into force in 2011. The fire department generals 2010 0.0% 0.0% 2011 0.5%- 0.8% verification of facts Sarah Goodlowski stated on Twitter on January 9, 2021: \"Not all women who lost their jobs (in the December Business Report) were mostly black and Latin women. :: 15 January, 2021 per cent of 0 per cent of 2012 4.3 per cent*0.0 per cent of 2013 not available** 1.5 per cent of 2014 not available** 1.0 per cent of 2014* But that was a one-year job. However, overall increases were small or non-existent for all city employees dating back to 2010, the year preceding Law 10. Significant observation: For 2013 and 2014, public safety officers have not yet negotiated a contract with the city. Therefore, although they have not yet received anything, they are still able to receive ex post facto payments once agreement on the contract has been reached. Public city workers and managers received small allowances in these two years. This was done without collective negotiations for most of these workers, because the largest trade union representing the city &apos; s employees was not re-certified under Act 10 of the Rules, as Montaguedo said. Before 2010, city employees of all types usually received 2 to 3 per cent increase with small variations. Trade union workers are usually at the top of that range, with managers who are not represented approaching the lower end. In the ranks of trade unions since 2007, the police and arson operations have exceeded those of public workers. Mandatory leave, including for police and firefighters, has led to a further reduction in wages. The Barrett budget for 2015 would eliminate the granting of leave to irregular workers, while their future employment in the police and firefighters would depend on the outcome of the labour negotiations. Our assessment of Kovac said that the police and firefighters routinely get 4% of the increase per year while everyone gets 0 or 1% of the increase. This scenario was seen in 2012, but has not yet reappeared. Since the promulgation of Act No. 10, regular workers have had a share of public servants, but only marginally at a time of austerity. We're assessing the allegation wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07171"}
