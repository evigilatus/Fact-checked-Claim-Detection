In the weeks since the adoption of the policy, Texas Goff. Greg Abbott has made numerous threats to follow state-level procedures to reverse Austin's decision. The Republican Party of Travis Province expressed support for the State's intervention in a news release on Wednesday, entitled \"The homeland gives more rights than real estate owners under the new camping policy.\" \"The recent change in city law to allow camps for displaced persons on private property, the business front, and even public pavements triggered a firestorm on both sides of the political spectrum,\" says issue. \"It is now legal in Austin for displaced persons to camp on the front of private property or on public rights on the road in the capital of Texas.\" This is an inaccurate description of Austin's policy that does not regulate private ownership. It allows people to sleep or camp in public areas adjacent to private property, as long as they do not pose a threat or face others violently. Austin Mayor Steve Adler said the description of Travis GoP County for a policy of \"clearly incorrect.\" He said, \"You can't camp on someone else's property unless they invite you.\" What does Austin's decree really say? The Austin City Council voted to ease local regulations affecting the displaced population of the city at the end of June, where the city experienced a flow of people living in public places. This new policy makes general camping - with the exception of gardens - lawful, as long as a person does not endanger \"the health or safety of another person or himself\" or \"the use of this area is unreasonably uncomfortable or dangerous.\" It also makes it legal for people to sit, sleep or hang out on public pavements as long as they do not engage in serious behaviour or acts considered aggressive. Police Chief Brian Manley said that the new policy would shift the focus of law enforcement from activities to behaviour, according to Austin's American man. \"I believe that it will have a greater impact on people's perceptions of their safety and that we are now unable to act in cases where someone has built a structure in front of a business or sits or lies in front of someone's work, but not necessarily dangerous.\" In his interview on January 31, 2021, John Kerry says that Hurricane Harvey \"dropped more water in Houston in five days than in Niagara Falls in one year.\" \"We should have said on public property and near private property,\" said in the e-mail. Andy Hog, party spokesman, said that the release was based on Facebook from the Austin Police Association and explained the new decree. \"If the Austin police aren't clear on the wording (which really needs to know), then what about the average Austinite?\" He said \"Hogg\" in an e-mail. However, the information on the Facebook website of the Police Association is accurate, as it says that people are allowed to camp or sit on public pavements as long as they are not dangerous. In an article dated 1 July, the Association stated that police officers were unable to respond to calls from the population concerning persons sleeping on the pavement in front of their homes. \"New obstruction/camp decrees allow camping on pavements, alleys and other public places (except gardens and city hall), which include in front of your home, provided that people in camp do not make the pavement uncomfortable or unreasonably dangerous,\" reads the article. According to a press release issued by the Republican Party of Travis Province, the new Austin laws governing general camping allow for \"unsheltered camps on private property, the front of business, and even public pavements\" and grant more rights to displaced persons than to landlords. This is an inaccurate description of Austin &apos; s new policies, which regulate only public property. It is true that individuals are allowed to camp or sleep near private property or business (as long as they are not dangerous), but only in public property. At the time of publication of this article, the Party had not corrected the issue on its website. We value this allegation wrong. - The statement is not accurate.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00459"}
