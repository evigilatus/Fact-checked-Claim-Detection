On NRATV, host Grant Stinchfield said he is \"committed to exposing the violent, even deadly history of these people behind this weekend\u2019s March For Our Lives, anti-gun fraud of a protest.\"\n\"March For Our Lives is backed by radicals with a history of violent threats, language and actions,\" Stinchfield said March 21.\nThe key evidence behind that claim?\nStinchfield argued that the Women\u2019s March, the massive protest the day after the inauguration of President Donald Trump in January 2017, is \"a major force behind\" the March For Our Lives.\nHe further argued that the Women\u2019s March organization is run by radicals with violent tendencies. Stinchfield\u2019s first example: Singer Madonna telling a crowd that she felt so frustrated after the election that she \"thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.\" (\"But I know that this won't change anything,\" she quickly added.)\nWe explored the facts behind each link in that chain of association. The organization behind the March For Our Lives defies easy description, but one thing is clear: As an organization, the Women\u2019s March is not a big player.\nThe Women\u2019s March organizers\nThe NRA broadcast mentioned Tamika Mallory, a Women\u2019s March national co-chair.\n\"She has nothing to do with this,\" said Allan Mayer, co-CEO of 42West, the public relations firm for March For Our Lives.\nThe NRA listed another Women\u2019s March co-chair, Linda Sarsour.\n\"Absolutely no connection to what we\u2019re doing,\" Mayer said.\nNRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam pointed to an article on Bustle, a news, entertainment and beauty website, describing how the youth engagement arm of the Women\u2019s March was promoting gun control activism. That\u2019s true. The youth organizers have posted a detailed gun control policy including a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. They promoted the National School Walkout protest in mid March and provided a toolkit for young organizers who wanted to hold their own local events.\nBut their website has only a single mention of the March For Our Lives. It is the 14th point on a page about the school walkout and says \"We will be at #March4OurLives too!\" It adds, \"It will take sustained action to end gun violence and we stand in solidarity with our peers who are also organizing around gun violence prevention.\"\nThe clearest link to the Women\u2019s March comes in the person of Deena Katz, a producer of Dancing With the Stars and a co-executive director of the Women\u2019s March Los Angeles Foundation. Through a personal connection to a family in Parkland, Fla., the site of the deadly school shooting, Katz stepped in early to work with the student activists at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.\nKatz applied as an individual for the permits to march in Washington. She is the president of the March For Our Lives Action Fund, a 501(c)(4) nonprofit established to fund the march and future lobbying on gun control.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Mayer at 42West said Katz is doing this on her own, separate from the Los Angeles Women\u2019s March group. A spokesperson for the LA group told Buzzfeed in February that the organization itself was not involved.\nMarch supported by gun control groups\nThe march has been a magnet for the many advocacy organizations that have pressed for gun control over many years. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence and Sandy Hook Promise all promote the march.\nTwo organizations, Everytown for Gun Safety\u00a0and Giffords Courage to Fight, are playing a prominent role in organizing sibling marches around the country and providing logistical muscle for the main march in Washington. Everytown \u2014\u00a0along with its grassroots organizing arm Moms Demand Action \u2014 has funded local marches, and maintains an interactive map showing where they are taking place.\nEverytown for Gun Safety receives significant support from former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Giffords Courage to Fight emerged after the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School and is the project of gun victim and former Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz., and her husband Mark Kelly.\nThe liberal activist group MoveOn and Planned Parenthood also actively support the march. Planned Parenthood lists 14 local marches on its website.\nThe Episcopal Diocese of Washington is coordinating housing and meals for out-of-town visitors.\nMarch For Our Lives has had no trouble securing hefty donations from Hollywood stars, companies and philanthropists.\nGeorge and Amal Clooney pledged $500,000, a sum that was quickly matched by Oprah Winfrey, Steven Spielberg and Kate Capshaw, and others.\nThe Italian fashion company Gucci gave $500,000, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff pledged $1 million, as did billionaire philanthropist Eli Broad.\nThe march also raised more than $3 million online through a GoFundMe campaign.\nOur ruling\nThe NRA said that the March For Our Lives is \"backed by radicals with a history of violent threats, language and actions.\" That allegation rested on the idea that the Women\u2019s March played a major role in the march, and the NRA host mentioned two co-chairs by name.\nWe found no evidence that either the organization or those people are directly involved in the march. The Women\u2019s March website doesn\u2019t even list the gun control march as an upcoming event.\nThe only significant tie between the marches is a producer who leads the Los Angeles chapter of the Women\u2019s March. But the chapter said it is not involved, and the producer has acted on her own to apply for permits and establish the March For Our Lives\u2019 nonprofit support fund.\nMajor organizational muscle behind the march, both in Washington and in cities nationwide, comes from two well-known gun control advocacy groups, neither of which has a history of violent behavior. A number of related organizations have lent their support, including the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, and celebrity donors have given millions of dollars.\nThe NRA claim is without merit. We rate it Pants on Fire.\nCorrection: After we published, a reader noted that the Youth Empowerment FAQ page on National School Walkout included a reference to the March For Our Lives. The fact-check has been corrected to reflect that reference.\nWe also updated the story to reflect Madonna's full quote from the 2017 Women's March.\n Share the Facts 2018-03-23 16:45:12 UTC   PolitiFact    1 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Pants on Fire  \"March For Our Lives is backed by radicals with a history of violent threats, language and actions.\"    National Rifle Association The leading national group promoting gun rights https://www.nratv.com/series/stinchfield/video/stinchfield-the-violent-radicals-behind-march-for-our-lives-womens-march-leaders/episode/stinchfield-season-2-episode-57   In a segment on NRATV.
