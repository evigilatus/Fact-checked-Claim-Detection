You know better than that,\" Beckel said during the March 11 edition of Hannity.\nBut Moore said cries about climate change are actually just about fits of weather.\n\"Basically, they're just saying weather these days,\" Moore said. \"They're saying the weather is climate change, but that's not true. Weather is just weather, like the cold weather we're getting this year. It has not warmed for the last 17 years. We know that for sure. And that brings into question the whole hypothesis.\"\nPunditFact wanted to know if the Earth has not warmed for the last 17 years, and what it means if anything for the theory of climate change.\nWe found clues, and seeming contradictions to his claim, in the PolitiFact archive.\nLately it\u2019s been hot a lot\nPresident Barack Obama warned the nation there will be consequences from not doing more to combat climate change in his 2013 State of the Union address, pointing out \"the 12 hottest years on record have all come in the last 15.\"\nPolitiFact rated his statement True. (Actually it\u2019s 13 or 14 of the last 15.)\nBut that doesn\u2019t necessarily rule out Moore\u2019s claim about the earth not getting warmer lately. The statements can co-exist, with some additional context.\nMoore\u2019s claim is a popular argument of people who say climate change isn\u2019t real. The problem is it is cherry-picked and leaves out the rest of the story about earth\u2019s dramatic temperature increases over the last century.\nNASA\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies tracks global land-ocean temperatures using a temperature index.\u00a0\n\n(The index shows the temperature anomaly of each year. The temperature anomaly shows how a year's land-ocean temperatures compares with the longterm average. A higher anomaly, such as 0.67 degrees Celsius in 2010, shows how much warmer a year was than the longterm average. A negative anomaly, last seen in 1976, indicates a cooler year than the referenced period.)\nAs you can see, Earth\u2019s land-ocean temperatures escalated starting in the 1970s, setting off a new era of rising sea levels, increased greenhouse gas emissions and melting sea ice. Temperatures spiked about 17 years ago in 1998, an outlier year that involved a strong El Ni\u00f1o with abnormally warm ocean temperatures.\nSince then, temperatures have remained relatively, but not entirely flat.\nThat\u2019s the basis for Moore\u2019s claim.\nThere are several problems with his analysis, however.\nData for 2014 isn\u2019t available yet. So really there are only 16 data points (years) between 1998 and 2014. If you include 1997 to the analysis, Moore is clearly wrong.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe years 2005 and 2010 were both warmer than 1998, though only slightly. That also makes Moore\u2019s statement technically inaccurate, though most scientists agree that temperatures have remained relatively flat recently.\nMoore cherry-picked a year when temperatures spiked. \"What was an extraordinary event in 1998 is now the new normal,\" said Goddard Institute program analyst Reto Ruedy, program manager at NASA\u2019s Goddard Institute.\nMoore would be incorrect if he chose 1999, 1997, 1996 or any year before that.\n\"If you start with an extremely warm year, the warming trend going forward is going to be mostly flat,\" said Gordon Hamilton, associate research professor at the Climate Change Institute at the University of Maine.\n\"You could easily choose 1999 and 1996 and you would find that there\u2019s an upward trend,\" said \u00a0Kevin Trenberth, a distinguished senior scientist in the climate analysis section at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo. \"It\u2019s cherry-picking to get the result that he apparently desires.\"\nMoore\u2019s response\nWhile Moore used the 17-year-statistic on Hannity to make the argument that climate change isn\u2019t happening, he told us the figure \"does not prove much.\"\nMoore said NOAA and NASA recordkeeping only go back 150 years and the planet\u2019s temperature has fluctuated over the course of time. It is cooler now than for \"most of life history,\" he said.\n\"It is a pause, flat, whatever you want to call it, for 17 years,\" Moore said.\nHamilton and Ruedy dismissed Moore\u2019s qualms, saying the 150-year record is reliable to determine statistically significant trends. For pre-19th century estimates, scientists use other methods, such as tree rings and ice core bubbles, to detect climate trends, Ruedy said.\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group operating under the United Nations that reviews climate change research, has concluded the warming of the climate is \"unprecedented over decades to millennia.\"\nMoore\u2019s Greenpeace ties\nA final note about Moore. In his interview on Hannity and in many other places, Moore has been described as a \"founder\" of Greenpeace. The organization, however, disputes that.\nGreenpeace devotes a webpage to explaining Moore\u2019s lack of credentials, though they agree he was involved in the group\u2019s early days. The group was founded in 1970 as the Don\u2019t Make a Wave Committee with the goal of stopping an American nuclear weapons test on Amchitka Island in the Aleutians. Moore, a college student, wrote a letter to the group in 1971 asking to join the crew of activists sailing to protest the nuclear test.\nMoore was one of three Greenpeace members on board the Phyllis Cormack, which carried a dozen passengers to Amchitka Island for the protest. Greenpeace says the group\u2019s founders include seven people, but not Moore.\nGreenpeace leaders voted Moore out of his positions as director of Greenpeace Canada and one of five directors of Greenpeace International, and Moore left in 1986, said Greenpeace spokesman David Pomerantz. He served as a consultant and co-chairman of the nuclear industry-funded Clean and Safe Energy Coalition until he retired from it in 2013.\nOur ruling\nMoore said the whole theory of climate change is called into question because \"it has not warmed for the last 17 years.\"\nIt\u2019s true that global surface temperatures have remained relatively flat for 17 years, since 1998. However, both 2005 and 2010 were warmer than 1998.\nMoore\u2019s statement alone ignores that the first decade of the 21st century was the warmest on record.\nAnd Moore is cherry-picking a timeframe to support his argument by starting at an extremely warm year. Global surface temperatures have risen, for instance, if you started at 1999, 1996, or any year before that.\nMoore\u2019s statement contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.
