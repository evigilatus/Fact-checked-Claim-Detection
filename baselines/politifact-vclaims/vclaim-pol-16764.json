Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., recently sought to raise awareness about suicide, focusing on its toll in her home state.\n\"On average, one person dies by suicide every 22 hours in West Virginia,\" Capito said in a Facebook post on Sept. 19.\nShe went on to note her efforts with two Senate colleagues, Cory Gardner, R-Colo., and Doug Jones, D-Ala., to pass the Suicide Training and Awareness Nationally Delivered for Universal Prevention, or STANDUP, Act, which would expand efforts to educate young people about mental health resources.\n\nIs Capito correct about the frequency of suicide in West Virginia? Capito\u2019s office did not respond to an inquiry for this article, but we were able to find statistics that backed up her assertion.\nWe turned to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s WISQARS database, which includes data as recently as 2017. The database shows that there were 393 suicides in West Virginia.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith 8,760 hours in a year, that comes out to about one suicide every 22.3 hours, making Capito\u2019s statistic correct.\nAccording to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, suicide is the 10th most common cause of death in West Virginia.
