Tim Kaine and Mitch McConnell have introduced a bill that would raise the age for buying tobacco products from 18 to 21.\nThe senators say they\u2019re bothered by a\u00a0surge in tobacco use by young people, brought on by e-cigarettes. The senators represent two of the largest tobacco-growing states: McConnell, the Republican majority leader, is from Kentucky; Kaine is a Virginia Democrat.\nKaine acknowledged tobacco\u2019s huge historic role in Virginia while introducing the bill in a May 20 floor speech. \"Tobacco has had such a place in our history that in the ceiling of both legislative chambers in the Virginia capitol, designed by Thomas Jefferson, the ceiling is circled by gold-embossed tobacco leaves,\" he said.\nIn Virginia, it\u2019s lore that the ceilings in legislative chambers are adorned with tobacco frescoes. But is it true? We fact checked the claim, spread by Kaine and many others, and it went up in smoke.\nTwo experts told us there are no depictions of tobacco on the ceiling - or anywhere - in the chambers.\n\"I can\u2019t think of anything that would be plausible in the House and Senate chambers,\"\u00a0said Mark Greenough, the capitol\u2019s historian since 2002.\nAlthough theres a forest's worth of leaves in the chambers, \"they\u2019re not tobacco,\" said Susan Schaar, clerk of the state Senate since 1990.\nLet\u2019s take a tour:\nSpanning the widths of the ceilings are embossed rows of sheafed leaves and berries. To the untrained eye, they may pass as tobacco. But Schaar, who grew up on a tobacco farm, knows better.\n\"Tobacco doesn\u2019t have berries,\" she said.\nA large, oval skylight, centers the ceiling of each chamber, tightly framed in a rectangular panel. In the deep corners of the panel that the curved skylight doesn\u2019t reach are the superimposed letters VA, painted blue and gold surrounded by embossed leaves. But again, they have berries.\nWhat are thesefronds\u00a0with berries?\n\"The laurel produces small round fruit or berries and that would resemble what we see here,\" Greenough said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt least half of the leaves in the chambers don\u2019t have berries. They're painted on canvases in recesses where the walls and ceilings meet. They're\u00a0frescoed on the borders of ceiling panels. All are painted gold. Closer to the ground,\u00a0berry-less leaves emboss\u00a0the plasterwork surrounding doors and windows, and on pillar-like structures that jut from walls.\nSchaar and Greenough say these are acanthus - a leaf that has adorned classic Greek and Roman architecture since ancient times. Thomas Jefferson relied on that style when he designed the state capitol in the 1780s.\nJefferson, however, did not design the house and senate chambers that wing the original capitol building. They were built in the very early 1900s. Greenough said the architect took pains to design the chambers in the exact Greek-Roman style of the Ionic order that Jefferson used.\nThe chambers opened in 1906, but there wasn\u2019t time to decorate them before the General Assembly session began. So everything, including the frescos, was painted bright white.\nThat\u2019s how the cghambers looked until 1908, when Virginia\u2019s first lady - Elizabeth Swanson - was put in charge of the decoration. Early this century, the chambers were meticulously restored to Swanson\u2019s design.\nKaine, in his speech, twice described the ceiling leaves as gold-embossed. But this needs elaboration. Greenough said there\u2019s no gold-gild on the ceiling. What was used originally and during the restoration was much cheaper Dutch metal paint.\nThe bottom line: \"It\u2019s not gold-gild paint, and it\u2019s not tobacco,\" Greenough said.\nBut those determined to find tobacco in the capitol may be able to declare a small victory. You have to leave the chambers and go to the rotunda, designed by Jefferson. Looking up to the corners of the third-floor ceiling, you can see long leaves painted rusty brown.\n\"There's nary a berry to be found,\"\u00a0Greenough said, pointing to the leaves. \"So, you know, at least it creates an opening for\u00a0 those who really want to find tobacco leaves in the Rotunda. I'm not going to swear to it.\"\nWe sent an email with our findings to Kaine\u2019s press secretary - Katie Stuntz. \"We learn something new every day!\" she wrote back. \"Thank you to the capitol historian and senate clerk for setting the record straight.\"\nOur ruling\nKaine said the ceilings of the Virginia Senate and House chambers are \"circled by gold-embossed tobacco leaves.\" \u00a0\nExperts say there\u2019s not a fleck tobacco on the ornate ceilings and walls of the chambers. What you see is likely\u00a0laurel - remember, tobacco doesn\u2019t have berries - and acanthus, leaves used since ancient times to adorn Greek-Roman architecture like the capitol. And there\u2019s no gild in the gold, just Dutch metal paint.\nKaine was repeating a myth which, by definition, must\u00a0be false. So that's what we'll rate his statement: False.\n Share the Facts 2019-05-30 19:58:23 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  The ceilings of the Virginia Senate and House chambers are \"circled by gold-embossed tobacco leaves.\"    Tim Kaine U.S. senator from Virginia https://www.facebook.com/SenatorKaine/videos/331912440822199/   A floor speech Monday, May 20, 2019 2019-05-20    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00587"}
