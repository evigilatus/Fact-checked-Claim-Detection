Warner promised us fiscal responsibility, but he\u2019s voted for nearly $1 trillion in new taxes and $7 trillion in new debt.\" Gillespie said in a video last month. \u00a0\nWe wondered whether Gillespie was right.\nPaul Logan, a spokesman for Gillespie, said his boss\u2019s claim stems from Warner\u2019s support of a Democratic budget plan that squeaked through the Senate last March on a 50-49 vote.\nThe plan -- authored by by Senate Budget Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray, D-Wash. -- called for $975 billion in new revenues over 10 years to be matched by an equal amount of budget cuts. The new revenues would come from targeting tax breaks used by high earners and corporations. That accounts for the \"nearly $1 trillion in new taxes,\" that Gillespie cited.\nWhat about the $7 trillion in new debt? Logan said that also came from Murray\u2019s bill. The legislation contained estimates that it would expand total debt from $17.1 trillion in fiscal 2013 to $24.4 trillion in fiscal 2023. That comes to a $7.3 trillion increase.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal U.S debt is the sum of two major calculations: 1) The amount of \"intergovernmental holdings\", or money the government owes itself to support beneficiary programs such as Social Security; and 2) The amount of \"public debt\" in Treasury securities that are held by individuals, corporations, the Federal Reserve and state, local and foreign governments.\nEconomists generally prefer to discuss the national debt in terms of the amount that is publicly held. Murray\u2019s bill would have lifted that portion from $12.2 trillion in 2013 tor $18.2 trillion in 2023 -- a $6 trillion increase.\nNow, let\u2019s turn to Warner, who\u2019s made budget reform his signature issue since entering the Senate in 2009. He\u2019s tried to establish a bipartisan coalition of senators who share his views that the nation\u2019s financial problems can be solved only through a combination of tax increases and spending cuts. He\u2019s criticized Republicans who refuse to increase taxes and Democrats who refuse to rein in entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare.\nWarner cast four major votes on budget plans last year:\n\nOn March 21, he opposed a bill passed by House Republicans that would have balanced the budget in 10 years through trillions of dollars in cuts and no new taxes. The bill, which would have increased the national debt by $3 trillion at the end of the 10 years, was defeated in the Senate on a mostly partisan vote.\nOn March 23, he supported Murray\u2019s plan, which was rejected by the House.\nOn Sept. 27, he supported a temporary government funding bill that passed the Senate. The House, however, insisted that the stopgap measure delay implementation of Obamacare. The resulting impasse led to a 16-day government shutdown.\nOn Dec 18, he voted for a successful compromise budget that did not essentially alter spending, revenues or the rising arc of the national debt, projected by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to reach a total $25.2 trillion in 2023. The public debt is projected to be $19.1 trillion in 2023.\n\nOur ruling\nGillespie says Warner \"voted for nearly $1 trillion in new taxes and $7 trillion in new debt.\" Although some economists might quibble with his debt figure, we don\u2019t.\nWe rate his statement True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08276"}
