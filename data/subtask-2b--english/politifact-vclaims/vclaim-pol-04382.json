Supporters of Prop 60 say the initiative would strengthen the existing law, which they say is rarely enforced.\nThe measure is sponsored by the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which has long pushed for greater safety standards in adult films.\nIn 2012, voters in Los Angeles County approved a similar condom requirement for adult films made in that county. It is considered a model for Prop 60, which applies its condom mandate to scenes with anal and vaginal intercourse.\nProp 60 would also require adult film companies to obtain a health license and pay for the costs of vaccinations and health tests for sexually transmitted diseases for their performers.\nWe asked the No on 60 campaign for evidence backing up its claim that performers would be open to lawsuits under the measure. A spokesman pointed to the initiative\u2019s section 6720.6, on enforcement, whistleblowers and private rights of action.\nIt allows those who witness violations of the proposed law -- including performers, prosecutors or anyone who is a California resident -- to file a complaint with the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health. If the agency declines to pursue the case within 21 days, the witness could then file a civil lawsuit against anyone with a financial interest in the film, which could include some performers.\nThere\u2019s no mention in the No on 60 advertisement, however, that only performers with a financial interest would be liable.\u00a0Nor does the ad mention the complaint process that must precede a lawsuit.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRobert Elyov / Flickr\nMore porn\u00a0workers with financial stake\nStill, opponents of the measure say making performers liable is significant because many have a financial stake in the content.\n\"You see, in today\u2019s adult film industry, the majority of performers are also producers,\" Eric Paul Leue, executive director of the Free Speech Coalition, wrote in an opinion piece about Prop 60 in the Advocate, a LGBT news publication, this month. \"In addition to shooting for studios, most porn stars regularly create their own content -- either for their own websites, on webcams, or in partnership with studios.\"\nProp 60 would apply to any commercial pornography produced in California, in traditional films and on the web.\nDr. Chauntelle Tibbals, a sociologist who studies the adult film industry, said the percentage of workers who have a financial stake in adult content they contribute to \"is certainly very high,\" though she said there\u2019s no accepted estimate. Advances in technology and distribution, she said, have allowed more workers to share in the financial success of their content.\n\"Everyone from webcam models to agents may have a financial stake in a single piece of content,\" Tibbals added.\nSupporters of Prop 60, however, maintain the claim about workers being exposed to lawsuits is deceptive.\n\"The only people who can get sued (under Prop 60) are producers,\" said Rick Taylor, who manages the Yes on 60 campaign. \"Some actors and actresses are producers. If they\u2019re breaking the law, they\u2019re going to potentially get sued.\"\nTaylor said the measure\u2019s goal is to bolster worker protections and public health, and that it doesn\u2019t matter what percentage of performers have a financial stake in the films.\nOur ruling\nOpponents of California\u2019s Prop 60, which would require condom use in adult films, recently claimed it would put \"workers in the adult film industry at risk for lawsuits and harassment.\"\nThe statement is partially accurate: Some adult film workers, and perhaps a growing share, could face lawsuits if they have a financial interest in the content they work on. But Prop 60 does not specify what constitutes a financial interest. Ultimately, it may be up to the courts to decide.\nImportantly, the claim by the opponents makes no mention that only workers with a monetary stake in the films would be liable and only after a complaint process plays out. Those who are independent contractors would face no legal action.\nThe statement leaves out this key context and gives the impression that any or all workers could face lawsuits.\nWe rate the claim Half True.\n\nHALF TRUE\u00a0\u2013 The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.\nClick here for\u00a0more\u00a0on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/be4f6e60-46d0-4490-af32-884f48bf9a49", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04382"}
