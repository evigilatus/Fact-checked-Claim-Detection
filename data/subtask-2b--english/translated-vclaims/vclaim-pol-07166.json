Sylverman spoke of the \"wage gap\" in a new video) launched a fund-raising campaign for the National Centre for Women's Rights. The wage gap indicates the difference between men &apos; s and women &apos; s earnings. In the video, Silverman's solution for disproportionate profit is to get a change in sex. This was a joke, but she didn't pay attention to statistics that weren't. (The video itself is a little NSFW, but here is if you're interested.) Sylverman says: \"Every year average women lose about $11,000 due to the wage gap,\" while sitting at the doctor's table in the hospital dress, waiting to consult for a change of sex. \"For the years of her life, this is almost 500 grand.\" In a phrase that you are unlikely to forget soon, you realize that \"this is a $500,000 vaginal tax.\" Let us spread the curtain to what men and women earn. Is it really a half a million dollar difference? According to the figures, the National Women &apos; s Legal Center is no longer ours, but FAQ on the group &apos; s website shows mathematics. In order to reach the Sylverman vaginal tax of $500,000, population income and poverty data for 2013 were used to obtain the average income of full-time workers aged 15 years and over, regardless of occupation. The average wage was $39,157 for women and $50,033 for men. The average difference is US$ 10,876, which amounts to US$ 11,000. These are essentially the same calculations made by politicians in 2012 to claim that the average share of women is 77 cents per dollar earned by men. As Paulette Fuckett, Bondit Fruit and other fact-checkers noted in previous examinations, the figure should be used with caution. It is difficult to tell who this is, but it is \"a brief procedure, just like anything else,\" as Valerie Wilson, an economist at the Liberal Economic Policy Institute, said. \"It may not actually be an experiment by any one person, but that doesn't make a mistake,\" said the professor of sociology at the University of Maryland Philip Cohen. \"It's the intermediate experience, which makes sense.\" And then Silverman hit 11 grand by 40 to reach $440,000. Why did they choose 40 years? We're not sure. There is no official government figure on the average length of American career. In the video, $440,000 becomes approximately $500,000. So you can see that there's already some generous rounding, as a tax that should be $435.040 over 40 years (in dollars today) is approximately $500,000. This is noteworthy, but it is not the only purpose of caution. The census is not the only source of income by sex. The United States Office of Labour Statistics tracks the average annual income of full-time wage workers using the current population survey. In 2013, the average weekly income of women was $706, or $39,520 per year. Men brought $860 a week, or $44.720 a year. This results in a much lower annual difference of an average of $5,200, which will translate into $208,000 at the cost of Silverman over the career, rather than $500,000. Also, looking at a one-year picture of Silverman's accounts is based only on a one-year view, when experts said that a longer period of time would be more useful. He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. By Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021 \"I think the average helps, but I'd rather see lifetime income calculated for average and average female workers than extrapolating from average for one year,\" as Tara Sinclair, an economist at George Washington University. The main difference between census data and census data is that the system does not cover self-employed persons. At the same time, the census does not cover some other workers, such as teachers, seasonal workers and construction workers. Some economists, such as those working at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, prefer to study hourly wages by gender because they include part-time workers (less than 35 hours), who are often women. In 2012, the latest year for which data are available, women &apos; s average income per hour was $11.99. For men, it was $13.88. However, the data for each hour are not without its flaws, as they do not account for paid workers, who usually earn more than workers per hour. Women also tend to work less hours than men, which may mean that part of the reason why men earn more is that they work more. According to the Labour Statistics Office, men worked an average of 8.34 hours per day in 2013. Women worked an average of 7.73 hours per day in 2013. Over 40 years, i.e. about 6,000 hours, or more than 700 days (without regard to leave, etc.). \"At least, I think that Sarah Silverman should calculate the tax on being a female after adjusting the number of working hours required to earn the average annual wage for men and the average annual wage for women,\" said Gary Bertless, economist at the Brookings Institution. \"This still leaves a tax, but it would be smaller if Mrs. Silverman really forgot to adjust to hours of work.\" The solution to the gap between economists was also shocked by Silverman's suggestion that the gap would disappear if it were a man. It is widely understood that the wage gap is not entirely due to gender discrimination. There are many ways to look at numbers, and the gap is narrowing as workers compare to similar levels of education, occupation and experience. For example, nurses and fund secretaries enjoy closer pay parity. However, the gap still exists. A 2012 report by the American Association of University Women found a \"unexplained\" pay gap of 7 per cent among full-time workers one year after their graduation from college in 2009, even when they made similar career and educational decisions. Part of it is the choice of profession, research suggests. More women hold less paid jobs than men, often choosing jobs as receptionists, teachers and nurses in primary schools, for example, while men disproportionately choose jobs as truck drivers, managers and software engineers. Another factor is the time taken by women to have and care for children. Cohen argues that even if a woman chooses to have children or to work less hours, it is still fair to consider her lifestyle as a \"tax.\" \"You may choose this lifestyle, and it still has a price,\" he said, compared to the cigarette tax. One last observation: \"Political behavior\" usually sucks on people who are considered to be something \"taxes\" when it isn't really. In this case, we believe it is clear that Silverman uses \"taxes\" as part of the punch and does not refer to a government trade tax on women. So we're not going to divide poetry into this term in our assessment. \"Every year, average women lose about $11,000 to the wage gap,\" the Governor Sylverman said, \"which amounts to a \"bagty tax of $500,000\" on their careers. The bulletproof figure to illustrate the gender gap is still out of reach, and Silverman's \"vagina tax\" is a lifetime estimate based on an average of one year. The economists we talked to were evasive of the $11,000, to some extent, as well as the irony in mathematics to reach $500,000. There are only many variables to describe the lifelong earning potential of \"normal women.\" However, most experts say that the wage gap does exist, although it is smaller when compared with equally experienced and educated workers. Identifying specific figures is just a problem. Sylverman's statement is partially accurate, but he ignores important details or gets things out of context. We value it half right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07166"}
