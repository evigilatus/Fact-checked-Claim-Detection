Mexico pays for the wall through the new USMCA business transaction. A large part of the wall has already been completely renovated or constructed. We've done a lot of work. Of the $5.6 billion approved by the House of Representatives, very little is in comparison with the benefits of national security. - Donald Trump (@realDonaldTromp) January 2, 2019 the U.S. government is in a partial state of closure as Trump and Democrats are in conflict with the allocation of taxpayers' funds to pay for the construction of the wall. Trump said that without the money for the wall, there was no agreement to reopen the government. The fence-shaped barriers at the south-west border have risen. But the wall Trump promised didn't come up. The question is: Does Mexico pay for the wall through a renegotiated trade deal, as Tramp claimed? No, the trade experts say. There are two immediate problems in the Trump statement. First, the renegotiated North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has not yet entered into force. The updated North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was renamed the United States-Mexico-Canada agreement, but it still needs congressional approval. The deal, literally, does not contain any language that says that Mexico will pay the United States against the wall. In addition, trade between the United States and Mexico has been duty-free for more than a decade, and a renegotiated trade transaction does not add new tariffs on goods from Mexico to the United States, as Lori Walsh, Director of the World Trade Observatory of Public Citizens, said. \"I don't see any scenario in which the U.S. government gets more money from Mexico itself -- and even if the U.S. tariffs are lifted, The Tramp claim that the costs of the wall will be covered by trade is not a new one. But it's wrong. Back on the campaign track, Trump claimed that Mexico was able to build a wall because Mexico's trade surplus with America is billions of dollars. We have estimated this error, as trade experts have said, there is no link between the size of the trade deficit and the creation of money for the construction of the wall. The trade deficit is mostly based on trade and investment by individuals and companies - not the Government itself, and then an expert told us. The recent Trump claim depends on the changes negotiated by the three parties to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) - the United States, Mexico and Canada. On February 1, 2021, Tom Cotton mentioned in an interview with Fox and friends \"Many of these arriving immigrants, we have no way of checking their background for either health or security.\" \u2022 3 February 2012, as we have already said, the renegotiated version of the trade agreement has not yet entered into force. They must remove several logistical obstacles and be approved by the legislative bodies of all three countries. If approved, it is likely to enter into force around 2020. Until then, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) remains in place. Trump can also choose to withdraw the United States from the North American Free Trade Area. Among other things, the renegotiated deal increases United States access to Canadian dairy and medicines markets, promotes labour and environmental rights, and expands intellectual property protection. It also aims to substantially increase the share of car and truck spare parts in North America. It increases the proportion of parts and inputs in North America that must be used in a car to qualify for duty-free treatment. Is there any provision in the agreement that would indirectly obtain the flow of funds from the Mexican Government to the United States Government - and that money be allocated to border security, specifically a wall? \"No,\" Walak told us. \"Trade agreements do not contain conditions for one government to pay another government or otherwise transfer funds.\" The White House argument does not support Trump &apos; s earlier claim that the new trade deal will pay for the wall, and journalists questioned White House press secretary Sarah Hackabe Sanders during a briefing on 18 December. (The White House did not respond to Paulette Fuckett's request for comment.) The President's position is that \"Additional income through that deal would show that Mexico was paying for the wall,\" said Sanders in December. After a reporter noted that commercial benefits went to ordinary citizens, not to the United States Treasury, Sanders said that Trump was talking about the public revenues that came from that. So you're taxing? The reporter asked me. No, Saunders responded. On December 18, he contributed to Forbes, Phil Levy, who served as the Senior Economist in Trade for the Council of Economic Advisers of President George W. Bush, wrote that if car manufacturers chose not to increase the percentage of content in North America for cars (as required by the new deal to be tariff-free), there would be a tariff for imports outside the North American commercial bloc. However, even in this case, those revenues from tariffs will not be allocated to the wall, Levi, a senior colleague in the global economy at the Chicago Council of World Affairs, who also studies international business strategy at the Kellogg School of Administration at Northwestern University. An assessment by the United States International Trade Commission (ITC) on the economic impact of the new agreement is still pending. In a scenario where United States private companies are significantly increasing their revenues under the new transaction, increasing total tax revenues in the United States, and then Congress may be commensurate with those funds, Wallace noticed. However, even then, legislators must agree to allocate those funds specifically to the wall. This seems doubtful, given the continued government closure on the financing of the border wall. \"I believe Trump could propose a new tax on increasing revenue from American companies involved in trade with Mexico, but this is not going through Congress,\" said Walsh. \"If they cannot obtain funds for the wall, imagine trying to pass a new tax to finance the wall.\" Our Governor Trump claimed, \"Mexico pays for the wall through the new USMCA business transaction.\" The name of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was re-negotiated. The United States Agency against Organized Crime has not yet entered into force. Even then, there was no provision in the Free Trade Agreement concerning Mexico, which paid directly for the wall. The Agency &apos; s new transaction did not introduce new tariffs on goods coming from Mexico to the United States, which was told by an expert. It is unclear how the transaction will affect business revenues in the United States. If the United States tax revenue increases in response to the increase in the revenues of American companies, then Congress still has to allocate that money to the wall. This is questionable. The Tramp claim also lacks supporting evidence. We assess it wrong.
