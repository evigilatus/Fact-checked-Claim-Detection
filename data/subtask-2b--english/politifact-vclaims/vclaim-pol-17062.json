And because the central bank\u2019s headquarters is located just a few miles away from the site of the explosion, the posts conclude that the Aug. 4 boom was the family\u2019s doing.\n\"The Beirut bombing today was directly next to the Lebanon Central Bank, which is also owned by the most evil deep state family, the Rothschilds,\" one post says. \"There are no coincidences.\"\n\"Rothschild bank explosion in Lebanon,\" says another. \"Covering up evidence \u2026 bodies everywhere, this was premeditated, multiple explosions.\"\n\"Don\u2019t believe the first narrative,\" the second post adds.\nThe two Facebook posts were flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Lebanese Prime Minister Hassan Diab and President Michael Aoun have pledged to investigate.\u00a0\nBut U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said Aug. 5 that \"most believe\" it \"was an accident, as reported,\" despite President Donald Trump\u2019s suggestions that it was an \"attack.\"\nRELATED: No evidence Israel hit Beirut with a nuclear missile\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLebanese authorities said the blast took place at a warehouse along the Beirut waterfront. They have attributed it to the detonation of more than 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate, a chemical commonly used in fertilizer. Diab said the stockpile had been at the warehouse for six years.\nIt remains unclear what set off the ammonium nitrate. A fire appears to have spread with the help of fireworks also kept at the port, according to early reports. The resulting explosion registered as the equivalent of a 3.3 magnitude earthquake. Reverberations are said to have been felt as far as Cyprus, more than 100 miles away from Beirut.\nBut what about the Central Bank of Lebanon? The Facebook posts claim that the Rothschilds own the bank, putting them in charge of a building not too far from the site of the explosion.\nThe Facebook posts are wrong about that connection, too.\u00a0\nThe headquarters of the Central Bank of Lebanon, or Banque du Liban, is located a few miles away from the port of Beirut, according to Google Maps. It is not \"directly next to\" the explosion site, as one Facebook post claims. Reuters reported that the building was not seriously damaged by the blast. And there\u2019s no evidence that it\u2019s controlled by the Rothschild family.\u00a0\nThe Rothschilds have been a target of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories for centuries, according to the Washington Post, including accusations that they control the global economy and various central banks. Supporters of QAnon have newly embraced those tropes.\u00a0\nBut the Central Bank of Lebanon is an independent government agency. It was established on Aug. 1, 1963, according to its website, and it started to operate a year later. The central bank is currently headed by Riad Salam\u00e9, its governor since 1993.\n\"BDL is a legal public entity enjoying financial and administrative autonomy,\" the bank\u2019s website says. \"Its capital is totally appropriated by the State.\"\nAs Reuters first reported, the 2019 annual report from Rothschild & Co, the family\u2019s strongest present-day tie to banking, does not mention ownership of central banks.\nOnly a handful of countries, including the U.S., have central banks with shareholders outside their respective governments.\nWe rate these posts False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17062"}
