It plays large among malaria advocacy groups like Nothing But Nets.\nSo it was curious to see a post in January on Medium from the head of the\u00a0President\u2019s Malaria Initiative, rear admiral Tim Ziemer, with the statement that \"in Africa, a child dies every minute because of the disease.\" The initiative is one of the government\u2019s largest global health efforts. It began under President George W. Bush and has been carried forward by President Barack Obama.\nMalaria\u2019s toll among African children is a touchstone for many health activists, but the numbers can vary. Our colleagues at Africa Check spotted a range of statements. One organization claimed a child died every 30 seconds, another said once every two minutes, and in between was Ziemer\u2019s figure.\nIn this fact-check, we affirm that the correct number is closer to once every two minutes.\nUSAID spokesman Ryan Essman told us that until fairly recently, his agency would talk about a death every one to two minutes, but now uses the two-minute time frame.\n\"Admiral Ziemer has been working with malaria for a decade,\" Essman said. \"He had it when he was child. Usually he uses the right number, but he might have slipped in the previous one.\"\nAs a humanitarian matter, the exact death toll makes little difference. This table from the Kaiser Family Foundation, using World Health Organization data, clearly shows that Africa bears the greatest burden of malaria.\n\n\n\n\n\nWHO Region\n\n\nNumber of countries with ongoing transmission\n\n\nEstimated cases (1,000s)\n\n\nPercentage\n\n\nEstimated deaths (in 1,000s)\n\n\nPercentage\n\n\n\n\nGlobal total\n\n\n96\n\n\n214,000\n\n\n100%\n\n\n438\n\n\n100%\n\n\n\n\nAfrica\n\n\n44\n\n\n188,000\n\n\n88%\n\n\n395\n\n\n90%\n\n\n\n\nAmericas\n\n\n21\n\n\n660\n\n\n<1%\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n<1%\n\n\n\n\nEastern\u00a0Mediterranean\n\n\n8\n\n\n3,900\n\n\n2%\n\n\n6.8\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2%\n\n\n\n\nEurope\n\n\n3\n\n\n0\n\n\n0%\n\n\n0\n\n\n0%\n\n\n\n\nSouth-East Asia\n\n\n10\n\n\n20,000\n\n\n9%\n\n\n32\n\n\n7%\n\n\n\n\nWestern Pacific\n\n\n10\n\n\n1,500\n\n\n<1%\n\n\n3.2\n\n\n<1%\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nAfrica wrestles with 90 percent of all deaths by the disease worldwide, and almost as large a percentage of active cases. Malaria is particularly lethal for pregnant women and their babies. The federal government estimates that it kills about 10,000 expectant mothers each year in Sub-Saharan Africa. Another 200,000 children will die prematurely from complications due to their mothers having bouts of malaria during pregnancy.\nMalaria\u2019s death toll\nOur colleagues at Africa Check turned to the World Health Organization data for 2015. With huge gaps in the health care systems in many African nations, all experts agree that a precise count of malaria death is impossible. The WHO provides a range of estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of malaria deaths in children under 5 in Africa\n\n\n\n\nMiddle estimate\n\n\n292,000\n\n\n\n\nLowest estimate\n\n\n212,000\n\n\n\n\nHighest estimate\n\n\n384,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nFrom that, the middle estimate shows one child dies every 1 minute 48 seconds, or close to once every two minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\nMiddle estimate\n\n\n1 min 48 sec\n\n\n\n\nLowest estimate\n\n\n2 min 28 sec\n\n\n\n\nHighest estimate\n\n\n1 min 22 sec\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nThe U.S. government spent about $860 million this fiscal year to fight malaria. The money went for a drug that can help pregnant women and their children, but many dollars also went to insecticide-treated nets and indoor spraying to prevent people from catching the disease in the first place. Obama seeks to raise the total by about another $70 million in the last budget of his administration.\nThere is a strong global push to eradicate malaria, and gains have been made. In the past decade and a half, the rate of new cases has fallen by about a third in Sub-Saharan Africa. Going forward, many hurdles remain. Mosquitoes can become resistant to the most common insecticides, weak health care systems in many countries make it difficult to sustain antimalaria programs, and counterfeit drugs can be as fatal as the disease itself.\nOur ruling\nZiemer wrote that malaria kills a child in Africa each minute. His staff at USAID said that figure is off. A better estimate is that a child dies every 1 minute 48 seconds. But even that figure comes with a measure of uncertainty. The actual death rate could be higher or lower.\nBy any estimate, malaria remains a serious threat to children in Africa.\nWe rate this claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05054"}
