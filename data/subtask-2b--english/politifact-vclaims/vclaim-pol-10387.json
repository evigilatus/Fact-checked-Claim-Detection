Not only does the state regulate the consumption of all alcohol, but the state buys, stores and sells distilled spirits to retailers and consumers.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMark Johnson\n\n\nstated on April 11, 2013 in a floor speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays \"Every legislative district in the state has at least one craft brewery and countless home brewers.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Yuxing Zheng \u2022 April 27, 2013\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat may change, with rumblings Thursday of a citizens\u2019 initiative to loosen our uptight liquor laws if lawmakers don\u2019t in 2013. Some legislators appeared reluctant to follow Washington state in privatizing liquor sales, as reported in a three-part series published in The Oregonian this week. State Rep. Bill Kennemer told a reporter: \"We just don't want to get to be like Louisiana, where you have drive-up daiquiri shops.\"\n\nPolitiFact Oregon wondered if perhaps Kennemer had first-hand knowledge to back up his bold statement. Because anyone who\u2019s grown up on the West Coast and has not traveled to the South knows there\u2019s no such thing as ordering a cocktail to go, especially from behind the wheel. (PolitiFact Oregon knows someone who knows someone who tried to order a takeaway gin-and-tonic from a San Francisco bar but was rejected, even though the person was on foot!)\n\nIt turns out, Kennemer did have direct knowledge.\n\nIn an interview, he explained he was driving around the New Orleans area with his wife, Cherie, one recent summer and they kept spotting these signs for daiquiris. The signs were attached to buildings with drive-thru windows. Blended frozen daiquiris are made with rum, lime juice and sweetener and have the consistency of iced smoothies. They come in many fruity flavors, plus chocolate.\n\n\"So after seeing this and being tempted multiple times,\" he said, \"and thinking what in the world could this possibly be, we drove into one and ended up ordering daiquiris.\"\n\nPolitiFact Oregon: Did you order the drinks and then drive off?\n\nKennemer (small voice): \"I\u2019m afraid we did.\"\n\nSo there\u2019s your evidence. Still, we understand that readers may want legal proof of proofed drinks to-go by vehicle, other than the word of a visiting legislator. For that, we contacted Jacques Berry, a spokesman for the Louisiana lieutenant governor\u2019s office.\n\nBerry couldn\u2019t tell us how many such drive-thrus dot the South Louisiana landscape, but he verified that a person doesn\u2019t usually have to go far to find one. For locals, it\u2019s a popular frozen treat on a Friday afternoon. \"It\u2019s not as much of a late-night thing,\" he said.\n\nAnd why the daiquiri, in particular? Well, Berry thinks it has to do with New Orleans bartenders mixing the ingredients that were plentiful and on hand, in this case, fresh fruit, rum and ice. The drinks caught on.\n\nDonnie Silva, owner of Big Easy Bachelor Parties in New Orleans, says he thinks the blended drinks are popular because of the climate. He was in Las Vegas recently when he says, \"I really wanted a daiquiri. I guess it\u2019s just the heat, we really don\u2019t have a winter. Fifteen of the last 25 Christmases I\u2019ve been in shorts and a T-shirt.\"\n\nWhich is an utterly foreign concept to Oregonians. As foreign as the daiquiri drive-thru.\n\n(Technically, Louisiana does not allow open containers in vehicles. The way it works is that an attendant hands you a drink and a straw and what you do with those two objects is up to you. Also, in some states, you can buy packaged liquor and beer through a drive-thru window. )\n\nWe realize Kennemer is citing an extreme example, and that\u2019s fine, but we should also remind readers that loosening our liquor laws won\u2019t necessarily turn us into Louisiana. California has liquor stores that any kid can enter to buy a pack of gum. And still you can\u2019t get a decent frozen daiquiri to go, by car, or a gin and tonic, by foot.\n\nWe rate the statement True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10387"}
