Then, with that in the background, she took center stage in a campaign ad with running mate Scott Walker that assails Democratic gubernatorial nominee Tom Barrett.\n\nLittle surprise the ad focuses on health care.\n\nIn the ad, Kleefisch talks directly to the camera:\n\n\"Thanks to the highest quality health care system in the world,\" she says, \"I won my battle with cancer. I can watch my little girls grow up. Tom Barrett supports a government takeover of our health care. A plan that would increase costs, lower quality and put government in charge of our health care choices. As a mother and a cancer survivor, that\u2019s unacceptable.\"\n\nAs Walker enters the shot and nods in agreement, Kleefisch concludes: \"Scott and I and our families think you should be in charge of your health care decisions.\"\n\nStrong words. Powerful message. But is it true?\n\nThe ad drew cheers on the right and howls from the left, in part because while Kleefisch attacks a \"government takeover\" of health care, her own coverage comes through a state-government plan that covers she and her husband, state Rep. Joel Kleefisch, R-Oconomowoc, and their family.\n\nWe\u2019ve been here before, when it comes to the charge that the health care reforms -- \"ObamaCare\" to critics -- amount to a government takeover. But this ad has a bit of a wrinkle, since it also points back to Barrett\u2019s time in Congress and an earlier health-care reform effort.\n\nLet\u2019s sort it all out.\n\nThe Walker campaign starts by pointing to Barrett\u2019s support for the Obama-led reforms.\n\nIt cites a Aug. 31, 2010 story from the Capital Times that includes this line: \"Unlike his opponents, Barrett touts his support of the federal health care reform bill. For those who call for its repeal, he says he has a few questions.\" The story then quotes Barrett: \"Why do you want to take health insurance away from a sick 3-year-old who may now, for the first time, be able to have health insurance? Or why do you want to take health insurance away from a 23-year-old woman who has diabetes but wants to go to college?\"\n\nThe Walker campaign also points to the fact that, as a U.S. House member from Milwaukee in 1993, \u00a0Barrett was a co-sponsor of Hillary Clinton\u2019s ill-fated health-care proposal.\n\nFinally, to support the \"government takeover\" charge, Walker campaign spokesperson Jill Bader points to a chart from the conservative Heritage Foundation that predicted the percentage of national health care spending under government control would pass 50 percent by 2013.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the evidence, piece by piece:\n\nThe Obama reforms: Leaving aside, for the moment, whether Barrett supports all or some of those reforms, PolitiFact National and its state affiliates have ruled repeatedly on the government takeover charge and found it ridiculously false -- a Pants on Fire. In truth, the health care law creates a market-based system that relies on private health insurance companies.\n\nTo be sure, government regulation of the existing system increases under the new system. More people will be covered. The government will create exchanges to provide coverage for Americans who have trouble getting it now. Medicaid, the government-run health insurance program for the poor, will be expanded.\n\nIt is not, as the ad suggests, a single-payer system with government running the sole plan. Indeed, the lightning-rod \"public option\" -- which would have added a government-run plan to the mix -- was dropped from the bill before it passed. Coverage would be paid for the same way it is now, by private employers and individual premiums.\n\nUniversal coverage advocates such as Citizen Action of Wisconsin say the national changes mean nearly half a million Wisconsin residents will now have access to private health insurance as Kleefisch and her husband already do.\n\nAs for the Heritage Foundation chart cited by the Walker campaign, the study notes its projection that government spending on health care will now exceed 50 percent of the market sometime in 2013 is part of a decades-long trend. Indeed, even without the Obama-backed reforms, the government was on track to pay more than half sometime in 2014.\n\nThe Hillary Clinton plan: Before Obama\u2019s plan, there was the 1993 plan that grew out of Clinton\u2019s work on a health care task force as first lady. Critics shorthanded it \"HillaryCare.\"\n\nTwo national health care experts -- one deeply involved in work on Clinton\u2019s health care proposal -- told PolitiFact Wisconsin that the Clinton approach was more aggressive and far-reaching than Obama\u2019s plan. A third, Robert Moffit from the conservative Heritage Foundation, judges them equally far-reaching.\n\nClinton\u2019s plan had national spending limits and tried to build a new insurance market with an aggressive regulatory structure, said Judith Feder, a former high-ranking Clinton administration official who is now a professor in Georgetown University\u2019s Public Policy Institute.\n\nBoth PolitiFact National and the New York Times have described Hillary Clinton\u2019s plan, which was dead on arrival in Congress, as a \"radical\" proposal.\n\nBut neither Feder nor Robert Blendon, a Harvard University professor of health policy and political analysis, think \"government takeover\" fits the Clinton plan -- or the Obama one.\n\nNeither do we.\n\nLet\u2019s return to the TV ad, which emphasizes Barrett supports such a plan:\n\nAt a news conference after the ad debuted, Barrett said it is \"not true at all\" that he supports a government takeover of health care and said he had never supported a single-payer system.\n\nCoverage of Barrett\u2019s 1992 congressional bid in the Milwaukee Journal shows that Barrett endorsed universal coverage -- that is, efforts to cover everyone -- but he rejected a government-run system.\n\nBut to Kleefisch, Barrett\u2019s view that he does not favor a takeover is undermined by his support for the Clinton plan and his views on the Obama-led reforms.\n\nIn an Oct. 14, 2010 interview with conservative talk radio host Charlie Sykes on WTMJ-AM (620), she put it this way: \"He\u2019s a liar.\"\n\nBarrett spokesperson Phil Walzak responded: \"Every plan Tom has forwarded has private insurance as the centerpiece. They are trying to generate false fear on this issue.\"\n\nAs for the Obama-led reforms now in place, Walker has argued they should be repealed and the state should join a lawsuit against them. Barrett has rejected the idea of joining the suit but has said Wisconsin's next governor needs to find ways to make sure the law is implemented fairly for the state.\n\nWhere does that leave us?\n\nWith the emotional emphasis provided by cancer survivor Rebecca Kleefisch, the Republican ticket echoes the GOP attacks used against Democrats across the country and characterizes the Obama-led health care reforms as a \"government takeover.\" \u00a0But repeating a falsehood -- however often and however loudly -- does not make it true.\n\nThe Obama reforms would expand the government\u2019s role, but a key principle of the plan is to rely primarily on private health insurance to provide coverage. The government \"exchanges\" would encourage private insurers to compete for workers from small businesses who currently may not have coverage.\n\nAs for Barrett, they argue that Barrett backed the whole bill, but provide evidence only that he talked up some aspects of it months after it passed. On the support of Hillary Clinton\u2019s plan in 1993, Barrett was a co-sponsor, and some experts say it went further than Obama\u2019s plan. But it still would have retained a private-insurance based system. It didn\u2019t amount to a takeover either.\n\nCan we light two matches?
