Actually, it's 4 years old", "text": "President Donald Trump has been barnstorming for Republicans in the midterms. On Oct. 1 he landed in Johnson City, Tenn., to help U.S. Senate candidate Marsha Blackburn, covering familiar ground about the improving economy.\nHe touted securing $716 billion for the military, and he gave Republicans credit for giving veterans a new health care option.\n\"We just passed Choice,\" Trump said. \"That was 44 years, they\u2019ve been trying to pass Choice. So that if you have to wait for nine days, 30 days, 21 days, months, you don\u2019t do that anymore. If the line is big, and you\u2019re unhappy, you go to a private doctor, they take care of you and we pay the bill.\"\nTrump repeated the point, saying, \"They\u2019ve been trying to pass that one for many, many decades. They couldn\u2019t do it. We got it passed. We\u2019re good at passing things, right?\"\nTrump is wrong that Choice wasn\u2019t passed until he came into office.\nCongress passed a new version of a Choice program in June 2018 \u2014 but the program itself has been around since 2014.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the scandal of long waits and the efforts of administrators at some facilities to cover that up, Congress and the Obama administration passed the Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act of 2014.\nFor veterans who couldn\u2019t be given appointments quickly enough, or who lived more than 40 miles from a Veterans Health Administration hospital, the government would pay for private care. In four years, Washington spent $12 billion on the program.\nThe bill signed by Trump, the VA Mission Act, is a major effort to fold a variety of community care programs at the VA into one integrated whole. That change won\u2019t take place for at least a year. Until then, the law provides $5.2 billion to continue the Choice program in its present form.\nWe reached out to the Trump administration but did not hear back.\nOur ruling\nTrump said that he and his fellow Republican \"passed Choice,\" something that others had been trying to do for 44 years. He described the program as one that allowed veterans to get private care at government expense.\nThe program to do exactly that has been around for four years. And it\u2019s always been referred to as Choice.\nWe rate this claim False.\n Share the Facts 2018-10-02 19:20:54 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  Says Republicans \"just passed\" the Veterans Choice program after 44 years of trying. \"They've been trying to pass that one for many, many decades.\"    Donald Trump President of the United States https://youtu.be/HkzIrGSctSk?t=5h13m15s   At a rally in Johnson City, Tenn.
