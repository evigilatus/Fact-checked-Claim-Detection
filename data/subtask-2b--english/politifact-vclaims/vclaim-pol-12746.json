We saw it airing as recently as July 14, 2011.\n\nA reader asked us to take a look at the ad, so we did.\n\nThe ad features a mother lying awake at night worrying about her family\u2019s economic situation. She says she supported Obama initially \"because he spoke so beautifully, but since then things have gone from bad to much worse.\" She says Obama\u2019s stimulus didn\u2019t improve the economy, and that the national debt worries her.\n\n\"Our country's got this huge debt,\" the ad says, \"and Obama says raise taxes and keep spending more? Doesn't Washington know we can't afford more taxes and debt? \u2026 There\u2019s got to be a way to take away President Obama\u2019s blank check.\"\n\nIn this item, we\u2019re focusing on the question of whether Obama\u2019s approach is to \"raise taxes and keep spending more.\"\n\nWe\u2019ll start by acknowledging a challenge with rating this claim. The most important fiscal debate currently under way involves the raising of the debt ceiling -- the legal limit on how much money the government can borrow. After hitting the debt ceiling earlier this year, the U.S. Treasury Department juggled accounts as a temporary measure to buy time for further negotiations. But officials now expect the debt limit to be reached on Aug. 2, 2011.\n\nWhile the negotiations have been high profile, they are fluid, and have largely been conducted in private. Instead of relying on official position papers, we are left with broadly worded public utterances by the participants and comments by unnamed aides reported in the media. And what is proposed one day may not remain operative the next.\n\nThat said, we do think there\u2019s enough information on the Obama administration\u2019s position on taxes and spending to enable us to judge whether the president has really said his approach is to \"raise taxes and keep spending more.\"\n\nFirst, taxes.\n\nOn this issue, the ad is on relatively safe ground. By all accounts, the biggest divide in the negotiations has been strong resistance among key Republicans, particularly House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., to raising any taxes as part of a final deal. Republicans in this camp want to see spending cuts alone.\n\nDemocrats, on the other hand, believe that whatever deal is reached needs to include some tax increases, rather than just spending cuts.\n\nThe White House portrays the tax increases it\u2019s seeking as either targeted -- for instance, closing provisions it considers loopholes -- or aimed at the richest Americans, particularly by letting tax cuts passed under President George W. Bush lapse for the highest tax bracket.\n\nStill, no matter how targeted, these policies would, as the ad says, \"raise taxes.\"\n\nHere\u2019s how Obama explained his position on taxes in a July 11, 2011, press conference.\n\n\"What we have talked about is that starting in 2013, that we have gotten rid of some of these egregious loopholes that are benefiting corporate jet owners or oil companies at a time where they're making billions of dollars of profits,\" he said. \"What we have said is as part of a broader package, we should have revenues, and the best place to get those revenues are from folks like me who have been extraordinarily fortunate, and that millionaires and billionaires can afford to pay a little bit more -- going back to the Bush tax rates.\n\n\"And what I've also said to Republicans is, if you don't like that formulation, then I'm happy to work with you on tax reform that could potentially lower everybody's rates and broaden the base, as long as that package was sufficiently progressive so that we weren\u2019t balancing the budget on the backs of middle-class families and working-class families, and we weren\u2019t letting hedge fund managers or authors of best-selling books off the hook.\"\n\nSo Obama does want a tax hike -- at least some specific tax hikes -- as part of a deal. Does he also want to \"keep spending more?\" As we analyzed this question, we assumed that \"spending more\" meant actually increasing levels of spending.\n\nOn this point, we think the ad is misleading.\n\nAt the same press conference, Obama said that he has \"agreed to a series of spending cuts that will make the government leaner, meaner, more effective, more efficient and give taxpayers a greater bang for their buck. That includes defense spending. That includes health spending. It includes some programs that I like very much, and we -- be nice to have but that we can\u2019t afford right now. And if you look at this overall package, we could achieve a situation in which our deficits were at a manageable level and our debt levels were stabilized, and the economy as a whole I think would benefit from that.\"\n\nIn his July 14, 2011, press briefing, White House spokesman Jay Carney offered additional specifics.\n\n\"We are now in a situation where our side, the White House, has made clear in a presentation yesterday that there are significant cuts -- $1.5 trillion in cuts that everybody can agree on, real and significant; an additional $200 billion in cuts that essentially we believe everybody can agree on,\" Carney said. \"That\u2019s $1.7 trillion, significant in and of itself. The president wants more.\"\n\nNeither Obama nor Carney cited specific cuts he\u2019d accept. (And the White House didn\u2019t provide us with a list.) That\u2019s not very surprising, since both sides are in the midst of a closed-doors negotiation.\n\nMedia coverage has provided a slightly more detailed picture.\n\nCantor himself indicated that the two sides had found some common ground on spending cuts. Referring to informal agreements from an earlier round of debt-ceiling talks led by Vice President Joe Biden, Cantor said that \"what the Biden group produced are areas where we believe we can come to an agreement,\" Dow Jones Newswire reported on July 11.\n\nAnd Obama himself had sought larger cuts than the Biden-led negotiations had produced. Under a $4 trillion \"grand bargain\" proposed by the president but rejected by Republicans, \"Obama was poised to accept cuts to Medicare, Medicaid and possibly Social Security in exchange for $1 trillion in revenue, mostly from repealing President George W. Bush\u2019s cuts for the wealthiest Americans after 2012,\" Bloomberg reported on July 14.\n\nCrossroads GPS, spokesman Jonathan Collegio said it\u2019s one thing for the White House to say it will accept a spending cut and another to actually accept it.\n\n\"Send me Obama\u2019s \u2019proposed spending cuts.\u2019 I\u2019m not aware of any specific cuts he has officially proposed,\" Collegio said. \"The only actual proposal I\u2019m aware of was his budget, which failed 97-0 in the Senate.\" He added that as recently as June, Obama proposed a new round of construction loans.\n\n\"So there are all these specific spending increases and spending increase proposals, weighed against a number thrown around in the negotiations but without any specific cuts called for whatsoever,\" Collegio said.\n\nWe see his point -- we, too, wish we could see more details about concrete commitments to spending cuts by the administration. However, we think that what Obama and Carney have said -- and what has trickled out from comments by the negotiators, including the acknowledgement by Cantor of common ground on spending cuts -- undercuts the ad\u2019s claim that Obama\u2019s intention is to \"keep spending more.\"\n\nThe ad is right about tax increases but incorrect about spending increases. On balance, we rate it Half True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H.
