It simply measures consistency in positions over time.\nSome argue a change demonstrates an openness to new facts or a willingness to compromise. Others say it is evidence of inconsistent principles or lack of backbone.\nSo, where does Humphries stand?\nHumphries then\nBefore the election, Humphries\u2019 views on Common Core can be found in letters he wrote on behalf of the Wisconsin School Psychologists Association. He was president-elect.\nIt\u2019s an imperfect source because the communications don\u2019t necessarily represent his personal views. But he personalized one of the letters using his own experience and has not said he disagreed with their content.\nIn October 2013, the group praised Common Core to a task force considering implementation of the standards.\nThe \"higher, better\" standards were developed with a broad coalition and should go into effect quickly, the letter said.\n\"There is broad agreement on the positive impact they have had already. I have seen firsthand the significant, positive impact these new standards have had on our work in schools,\" Humphries wrote.\nHumphries told the task force that he was a school psychology consultant for the state Department of Public Instruction before returning to the schools in 2011, working in Dodgeville as a school psychologist and director of special education and pupil services.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Common Core has required educators to refocus their efforts, he wrote:\n\"In Dodgeville for example, our staff spent hundreds of hours this summer re-working our curricula in order to align with the new, higher standards.\"\nThe letter offered some specific criticisms of Common Core, but said it should be the \"baseline\" for any new standards.\nIn March 2014, Humphries and two other officials with the group expressed concerns about proposed state legislation to dump Common Core and start from scratch to develop new standards.\nNew standards could be less rigorous and take Wisconsin out of the national conversation on educational outcomes, the letter warned, because more time and national expertise would be needed if Wisconsin started over.\nRather, the authors wrote, the state should improve and clarify some areas of Common Core, then provide money to put the \"Wisconsin Common Core Extension Standards\" into effect.\nHumphries now\nJump ahead to February 2017.\nOn the campaign trail, Humphries said he wanted to \"replace\" Common Core.\nThe standards, he said, are too weak. Instead, the state should take two years to develop new standards with state and national expertise.\nGood intentions have frequently turned to poor implementation, inadequate communication, and too many decisions being taken away from parents and educators by state and federal politicians, Humphries said in a campaign news release in February 2017.\nHumphries\u2019 praise of Common Core had been criticized by some conservatives, and his rollout of a \"repeal\" was greeted skeptically Feb. 2, 2017 by talk show host Jerry Bader in an appearance on that show.\nOn that show, Humphries said he disagreed that the 2013-\u201914 letters were supportive of Common Core.\nOur rating\nIt\u2019s tempting to call this a Half Flip given that the 2013-14 correspondence wasn\u2019t entirely praiseworthy of Common Core. And there\u2019s the problem that Humphries was speaking for hundreds of psychologists, not just himself.\nBut in our view Humphries downplays and miscasts those letters instead of distancing himself from the positions expressed.\nAnd the contrast is vivid: Common Core was strong, now it\u2019s too weak. Common Core is needed right away, now we can wait two years. Common Core should be the baseline, now it should be dumped.\nThat\u2019s a major reversal. And a Full Flop.\n\nShare the Facts\n\n\nPolitifact\n\n\n8\n6\n Politifact Rating:\n\u00a0\n\nOn using the Common Core standards for English and math instruction\n\n\n\nJohn Humphries\nWisconsin state school superintendent candidate\n\n\nCampaign statement\nThursday, February 2, 2017\n02/02/2017\n\n\nRead More\ninfo", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03670"}
