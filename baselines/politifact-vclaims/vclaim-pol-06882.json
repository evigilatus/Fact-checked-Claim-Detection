Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.\nOn NBC\u2019s Meet the Press\u00a0on Jan. 4, 2015, Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., said the new Republican Congress\u2019 first priority in 2015 will be to pass a bill approving construction of the oil pipeline, which would stretch from Canada to Steele City, Neb., where it would connect with an existing pipeline that goes to the coast of Texas.\nKlobuchar responded by saying the project \"has merit\" but that the decision to build the pipeline should rest with President Barack Obama, not Congress. She said the debate has become a \"symbolic\" one that ignores America\u2019s healthy energy market.\n\"We're now the no. 1 producer of oil in the world,\" she said. \"We've surpassed Saudi Arabia.\"\nWe decided to check out the data and see if in fact the United States is the world\u2019s top oil producer. As it turns out, the United States passed over Saudi Arabia about two years ago.\nAccording to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which tracks global energy production and consumption statistics, the United States has produced more oil than Saudi Arabia since the fourth quarter of 2012. American oil production surpassed Russia in 2011.\nHere\u2019s a chart showing the trend from the Energy Information Administration:\n\nIn the third quarter of 2014 -- the most recent available data -- the United States produced 14.2 million barrels of oil per day; Saudi Arabia produced 11.7 million per day; and Russia produced 10.5 million per day. Together, that\u2019s about 40 percent of total global production.\nThis production growth has contributed to the United States\u2019 ability to produce more oil than it imports for the first time in about 20 years.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Energy Information Administration expects American production to continue to grow in 2015, despite recent lower crude oil prices.\nTotal oil production figures include crude oil, natural gas liquids and other liquid energy products.\nOn top of oil, the United States produces significantly more natural gas than Saudi Arabia. According to the Energy Information Administration, United States energy production is about evenly split between petroleum and natural gas. Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, primarily produces petroleum.\nThe majority of the United States\u2019 oil production growth is concentrated in four regions: Bakken, N.D., Eagle Ford, Texas, the Niobrara region in the Upper Midwest, and the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico.\nNorth Dakota and Texas together comprise almost 50 percent of all crude oil production in the United States -- compared to 2010, when the two states combined produced just 26 percent of all United States crude oil production.\nIn 2013, energy markets consultant group PIRA Energy published a report that said shale production is one of the driving forces behind the country\u2019s production growth. Shale oil and gas are commonly associated with hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, which is the process of using water pressure to fracture a rock to release natural gas and oil. The United States is the world leader in shale gas production.\nThere is at least one piece of context to keep in mind when looking at the United States\u2019 oil production compared to Saudi Arabia, noted Leonardo Maugeri, an associate at Harvard University\u2019s Geopolitics of Energy project. Saudi Arabia has a higher capacity than the United States to produce oil, but it chooses not to use it all -- so as not to inundate the global oil market.\n\"In other words, if Saudi Arabia produced at full capacity -- as the U.S. does -- its production would be higher than the U.S.,\" Maugeri said.\nOur ruling\nKlobuchar said the United States is \"now the No. 1 producer of oil in the world.\"\nThe latest global oil production statistics back up Klobuchar\u2019s claim. The United States has been the world\u2019s largest oil producer since late 2012.
