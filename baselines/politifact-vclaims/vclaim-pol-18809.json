Toalson Reisch is the Republican incumbent running for Missouri House District 44.\nIn a Facebook post supporting students re-entering classrooms, she spoke about how Columbia Public Schools in her district are affected by the pandemic.\u00a0\n\"All schools are open in Boone County except Columbia. Their kids are suffering,\" Toalson Reisch wrote.\nToalson Reisch then made this claim: \"The Columbia school buildings in my district have the lowest test scores in all of Boone County.\"\nShe linked the scores to the fact that CPS schools are online, while other school districts in Boone County are teaching in person, such as the Hallsville R-IV school district. Toalson Reisch\u2019s district includes Hallsville and parts of Columbia.\u00a0\nWords like \"most\" or \"lowest\" are warning bells at PolitiFact. So we decided to look deeper into this claim.\u00a0\nThe \"floor\" on performance reports\nIn an email, Toalson Reisch said she was referring to Annual Performance Reports, or \"APR\" scores, specifically for Blue Ridge Elementary, Alpha Hart Lewis Elementary, and Eliot Battle Elementary in the Columbia schools district. We used other elementary and intermediate schools in the county as a comparison. \u00a0\nMissouri APR scores rate schools on their performance using these terms: floor, approaching, on track or exceeding. Floor is the worst rating, while exceeding is the best. A floor rating means the school improved by less than 1% on Missouri Assessment Program tests. An exceeding rating means the school improved by 5% or greater.\u00a0\nAccording to Mallory McGowin, a spokesperson for the Missouri Department of Education, the APR is calculated based on three principles: status, progress and growth. Each school gets a rating in one of these principles, as well as a category. For example: growth in math, status in language arts, etc.\u00a0\nHere\u2019s how McGowin explained each principle:\n\n\nStatus: Student achievement levels.\n\n\nProgress: A school district\u2019s improvement from prior years.\n\n\nGrowth: The gains students are making over time.\n\n\nColumbia Public Schools spokesperson Michelle Baumstark says state assessments weren\u2019t given this year due to the pandemic, and she said APR scores weren\u2019t calculated at the school building level for the 2017-18 or 2018-19 school years.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Tony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data that Toalson Reisch is referencing wasn\u2019t calculated since the 2016-17 school year. Any data she is referencing is over three years old.\u00a0\nHowever, McGowin was able to provide building level data for Boone County. The school data showed how each school performed in different categories like language arts and math scores.\nWe looked at each school based on the number of \"floor\" ratings it received. Floor ratings ranged from 2 to 21. High schools in Boone County had the most floor ratings on average, between 12 and 21. The range for middle and elementary schools was from two to 12.\u00a0\nAccording to the data provided by the Missouri Department of Education, here\u2019s how the Columbia schools Toalson Reisch spoke about performed in the past two school years.\n\n\nBlue Ridge Elementary: 10 floor ratings\n\n\nAlpha Hart Lewis Elementary: 12 floor ratings\n\n\nEliot Battle Elementary: Seven floor ratings\n\n\nBut some other schools in Toalson Reisch\u2019s district performed as bad or worse during the past two school years. These schools are in her district but are not in Columbia:\n\n\nCentralia Intermediate: 12 floor ratings\n\n\nCedar Ridge Elementary: 12 floor ratings\n\n\nHarrisburg Elementary: 12 floor ratings\n\n\nWhile Alpha Hart Lewis had as many floor ratings as these schools, the other schools Toalson Reisch provided are actually doing better.\nOur ruling\nToalson Reisch said, \"The Columbia school buildings in my district have the lowest test scores in all of Boone County.\"\u00a0\nElementary schools such as Alpha Hart Lewis Elementary and Blue Ridge Elementary have some of the lowest APR scores in Boone County. However, there are other schools in Boone County that are just as low or lower.\nWe rate her claim Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18809"}
