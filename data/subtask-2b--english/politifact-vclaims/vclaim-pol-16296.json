McSame as Bush.\"\n\n\nUniversal health care has been much debated in the Democratic primary campaign, but hardly mentioned on the Republican side. The consensus among health care experts is that to achieve universal health care \u2014 the intention to cover every person with no exceptions \u2014 there must be a legal requirement for care, such as\n\na mandate for individuals to buy insurance\n\n. In the Democratic primary campaign,\n\nSen. Hillary Clinton supports an individual mandate, while Sen. Barack Obama opposes it\n\non the grounds that its implementation could penalize the working poor.\n\n\nBush does not support any sort of health care mandate, nor does McCain.\n\n\n\"On health care we trust patients to make decisions, not bureaucrats in Washington, D.C.,\" Bush said on March 13, 2008, at a Republican Congresional Committee dinner.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

I think that one of our goals should be that every American own their own home. But I'm not going to mandate that every American own their own home,\" McCain said.\n\n\nMcCain does have a health care plan, but there's no clause for making it apply to everyone and therefore universal.
