However, McCain chooses cherry from her comments and mistakenly suggests that she turned her voice on how successful the surge was and that she was urged to support the withdrawal of troops because of recent criticisms. In fact, she referred to this point in the original letter, as well as in the Wednesday statement. On Monday, Clinton made headlines when I told the annual meeting of foreign war veterans in Kansas: \"We have begun to change tactics in Iraq, and in some areas, especially in Anbar province, it works.\" On January 13, 2021, bloggers announced the extraordinary truth-checking story in which General David H. Berger, the US Navy commander, said that they rejected Nancy Belusi's request for the use of marines for security, saying, \"We are not working for you.\" By Samantha Buterman, on January 17, 2021, she also told the Armed Forces of the Philippines that she did not believe that the conflict in Iraq could be resolved militarily, or that American forces should maintain security in a civil war. She said, \"The best way to honor their service is to start returning them home.\" McCain's statement doesn't mention that part of her speech. On 22 August, the Clinton Senate Bureau issued a statement in which it stated that it had not changed its position: \"The mutation was designed to give the Iraqi Government time to take steps to ensure a political solution to the situation. And I failed to do that... It is quite clear that there is no military solution to the sectarian fighting in Iraq. We must stop judging the war, and start going out now.\" In fact, Clinton introduced legislation in February in the Senate, S. 670, to withdraw troops from Iraq. :: Editor &apos; s note: This statement was estimated to be barely correct when it was published.
