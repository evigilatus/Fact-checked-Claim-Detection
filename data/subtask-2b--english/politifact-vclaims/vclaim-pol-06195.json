And I said, oh, that's too bad, how can I be tied with this guy? He's terrible. He's terrible. He's weak on immigration,\" Trump said during a speech in Phoenix\u00a0on July 11, 2015. \"You know, the sanctuary cities, do you know he had five of them in Florida while he was governor? Can you believe this? I didn't know that.\"\nTrump was practically tied with Bush according to\u00a0a\u00a0poll released the same day. But more importantly, Trump seized upon an increasingly used talking point in the presidential campaign -- \u00a0so-called \"sanctuary cities\" that thwart federal immigration law.\nBush\u2019s stance on illegal immigration has\u00a0wavered a bit over the years, but he was known for being in favor of deportation while in the Governor\u2019s Mansion. Did five sanctuary cities exist in Florida during his time in office? Not according to any official metric, but the Internet is a big place.\nSanctuary cities\nThere is no specific legal definition of\u00a0sanctuary cities, but it generally refers to places where local law enforcement officers aren\u2019t required to alert federal authorities to residents who may be in the country illegally.\nThe easiest sanctuary cities to identify are those with formal written policies.\nThe recent shooting death of a San Francisco woman, allegedly by a Mexican native with a criminal record, has\u00a0sparked a debate\u00a0over rules like San Francisco\u2019s\u00a0quarter-century-old law\u00a0declaring it a \"city and county of refuge.\" The San Francisco law generally bans public employees from assisting Immigration and Customs Enforcement with investigations or arrests unless required by a law or a warrant. There is an exception for people convicted of felonies.\nThe term appears to have roots in the 1980s, when Central American refugees fled civil wars and were initially denied asylum. Religious institutions banded together to protect the refugees, with some cities expressing solidarity with the \"Sanctuary Movement,\" according to a\u00a02011 paper\u00a0by the Immigration Policy Council. But before then, starting in the 1970s, some cities started policies banning police from asking about the immigration status of people who hadn\u2019t been arrested.\nWe reached out to Trump\u2019s campaign and didn\u2019t hear back; Bush\u2019s people had no comment, either. So we went in search of lists of sanctuary cities.\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Research Service published a\u00a02006 report listing 31 cities and counties\u00a0that \"will generally promote policies that ensure such aliens will not be turned over to federal authorities.\" No Florida cities were included.\nWe also found websites that had put together their own lists, such as a 2007 list created by the\u00a0Ohio Jobs and Justice PAC. Steve Salvi, the group\u2019s founder, is critical of sanctuary cities and claims to have created the most comprehensive list of its kind. It was most recently updated in July 2015\u00a0and includes five Florida locations:\u00a0\n\n\nDeLeon Springs;\n\n\nDeltona;\n\n\nJupiter;\n\n\nLake Worth, and\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMiami.\n\n\nSalvi told us that he culled the list by looking at news reports and input from local citizens. The requirements for the list are very loose -- cities could have provided services to illegal immigrants, or have leaders who promoted immigration reform.\u00a0\nWe found a few problems with the list. DeLeon Springs isn\u2019t even a town, but part of unincorporated Volusia County. The county sheriff\u2019s department oversees law enforcement there and in Deltona. The Deltona city attorney and the Volusia County Sheriff\u2019s Department both said Deltona had never had such a policy since being incorporated in 1995.\nOfficials in Jupiter and Lake Worth, which Salvi added to the list \u00a0in 2009 (after Bush left office), said they aren\u2019t sanctuary cities. Both cities have day-labor centers, which could be why they landed on the list. However, the existence of such centers for illegal immigrants to look for work doesn\u2019t tell us anything about whether police cooperate with immigration authorities.\nMiami Mayor Tom\u00e1s Regalado denies that his city is a sanctuary city, either now or when Bush was in office.\u00a0\n\"Do police enforce immigration? No, we never have. .... Officially, we don\u2019t protect immigrants or deliver immigrants (to federal officials),\" Regalado said.\nCurrent policies\nThe Center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors stricter immigration laws, regularly updates\u00a0a map on its website detailing sanctuary cities, counties and states. It also lists why a location is included.\nAs of this writing, the map listed seven Florida counties: Broward, Hernando, Hillsborough, Miami-Dade, Palm Beach, Pasco and Pinellas. The center told PolitiFact it based its map on\u00a0U.S. Department of Homeland Security data from 2014\u00a0(years after Bush left office).\nUnder a former program called\u00a0Secure Communities, Immigration and Customs Enforcement got fingerprints from suspects, and if they had violated immigration laws, the agency asked local authorities to detain them. But some local officials complained that immigrants who were victims of crimes were avoiding the police, so the officials refused to comply with the ICE detainers. The federal agency announced a new more targeted program in November.\nIn Florida, six of seven counties\u2019 sheriff\u2019s departments adopted policies in 2014 to no longer honor those \"detainer\" requests unless there is a legal order to do so.\nMiami-Dade County\u00a0stopped complying\u00a0with the requests a year earlier, in 2013. The Miami-Dade County Commission adopted the policy because the jail had to bear most of the detentions\u2019 cost, and because immigration advocates clamored for the change. Now, arrested illegal immigrants are detained only if they have an outstanding warrant.\nWhat could Bush or any governor do to deter sanctuary cities? It seems like the Legislature would have had to have acted, and we didn\u2019t find any action on the matter during Bush\u2019s time.\u00a0\nIn 2008, after Bush left office, a bill that would have prevented sanctuary cities in Florida\u00a0died in the Legislature, when Sen. Marco Rubio was then speaker of the House. The bill would have\u00a0prohibited statewide any sort of government restrictions\u00a0on disclosing someone\u2019s immigration status in several scenarios, including employment or issuing public benefits. It also would have required all public employees to work with federal agencies to comply with federal immigration laws.\nOur ruling\nTrump said Florida had five sanctuary cities while Bush was governor.\u00a0\nThere\u2019s no legal definition of a sanctuary city, and therefore no official classification. A federal report from 2006, when Bush was governor, didn\u2019t name any Florida cities. We found one list on the Internet that claimed five Florida locations as current sanctuary cities, but the supporting evidence was virtually nonexistent. City officials told us they weren\u2019t sure why their cities were on the list.\nFor lack of evidence, we rate Trump\u2019s statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06195"}
