Fox News is over,\" the screenshot says. \"I\u2019ll be starting at NewsMax next month.\"\n\"Good News,\" says a caption on the Facebook post. \"TUCKER CARLSON IS MOVING TO NEWS MAX. WHERE THE TRUTH PREVAILS.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\n(Screenshot from Facebook)\nSince Fox News projected that Joe Biden would win the election against President Donald Trump, some conservatives have flocked to NewsMax, a conservative TV network that has not declared a winner. But Carlson is not leaving Fox News to join NewsMax \u2014\u00a0the Parler post is a fake.\nThe username in the fake Parler post is @TuckerCralson \u2014\u00a0not @TuckerCarlson, which is the host\u2019s real Parler handle. The real Carlson has also not posted about leaving Fox News for NewsMax.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe reached out to Fox News for a comment, but it did not provide one on the record.\nThe fake Carlson Parler account was created five days ago and is listed as private. We couldn\u2019t verify whether the false post was published by the account in the first place.\nSince the election, Parler has seen an influx of users as mainstream social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, crack down on political misinformation. According to Parler\u2019s community guidelines, users may not make \"any use of another\u2019s name or likeness in a confusing or deceptive manner.\"\nStill, several conservative politicians have recently been the target of fake Parler posts.\nA screenshot posted on Facebook Nov. 13 made it look like Sen. Kelly Loeffler, R-Ga., said \"Black people shouldn\u2019t be allowed to vote\" in a Parler post. A bogus profile for Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves has also made the rounds on social media. Politico found several similar fake accounts for GOP officials over the summer.\n\"Don't assume screenshots from Parler are real,\" said NBC News reporter Ben Collins in a Nov. 15 tweet. \"You can change the name of your account to impersonate whoever you want over there.\"\nWe reached out to Parler for a comment, but we haven\u2019t heard back.\nThe Facebook post is inaccurate and ridiculous. We rate it Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18526"}
