Patrick Murphy questioned how Republican Sen. Marco Rubio could stand by Donald Trump at the first U.S. Senate debate, especially since Rubio attacked Trump throughout the Republican presidential primary.\n\"My opponent, Marco Rubio, made it clear: Not only does he think Donald Trump is a con man, he went on to say he doesn't trust Donald Trump with the nuclear codes,\" Murphy said in Orlando on Oct. 17.\nMurphy is right \u2014 Rubio has not held back in his words against Trump. On multiple occasions, Rubio referred to Trump as a con man or con artist and said he doesn\u2019t trust Trump with the nuclear codes.\nRubio did not deny the comments in his response, saying, \"I don\u2019t trust either one of them. And the job of a U.S. senator is not to blindly trust a president because they happen to be from your own party.\"\nHe added later: \"I stand by everything I ever said in the Republican primary. And I would admit right off the bat this is not the most inspirational choice we\u2019ve ever had in American history in terms of these two candidates.\"\nThe problem, Rubio said, is Democrat Hillary Clinton is even less trustworthy with sensitive information than Trump.\nSo the candidates agree that Rubio trashed Trump but backs the nominee anyway. We ran down the quotes in question.\nRubio dubbed Trump a con on multiple occasions when he was vying for the Republican nomination. Most of the name-calling happened after a Feb. 25 GOP primary debate, as Rubio made the morning TV news rounds and attended rallies.\nRubio called Trump a con man four times in 15 seconds at a rally in Oklahoma City on Feb. 26.\n\"I will never stop until we keep a con man from taking over the party of Reagan and the conservative movement,\" Rubio said of Trump. \"He\u2019s a con man. He's a con man. He\u2019s a con man. I'll tell you why.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 23, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBiden invested the entire family fortune in Ukraine gas and oil.
