No, only fully automatic are basically prohibited", "text": "The day after a man with a semiautomatic rifle killed 49 people and wounded 53 others at a gay nightclub, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee\u00a0Hillary Clinton renewed her call for a federal ban on assault weapons.\nOn the same day, June 13, 2016, Wisconsin Republican Ron Johnson responded to an interviewer\u2019s question about the Orlando incident by stating:\n\"Assault rifles already are banned.\"\nSo, are they prohibited in the United States, or not?\nIt depends on what assault means.\nBut Johnson, who is chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, is off-target in suggesting there is a blanket ban on assault rifles.\nJohnson\u2019s claim\nJohnson was interviewed by Charlie Sykes, a conservative talk show host on WTMJ-AM in Milwaukee, who asked:\n\"Should we be more concerned with the possible violation of Omar Mateen's Second Amendment rights, as opposed to the constitutional rights of the 50 people who are now dead?\"\nMateen, who was shot dead in the club by police after the rampage, had been armed with a Sig Sauer MCX semiautomatic rifle and a 9mm handgun.\n(Orlando police officials initially said Mateen used an \"AR-15-type assault rifle.\" Both an AR-15 and the Sig MCX can fire the same type of ammunition at roughly the same speeds, are aesthetically similar and equally lethal, according to the Washington Post. The manufacturer describes the Sig MCX as \"the first true mission-adaptable weapon system.\")\nJohnson answered Sykes\u2019 question by saying:\n\"That's that delicate balance, Charlie. And that's what we need to have an honest and legitimate conversation about, as opposed to leaping to conclusions.\n\"To say things like we've got to ban assault rifles. Well, assault rifles already are banned. OK? So, we need to actually have an honest discussion about these issues and understand that this is very difficult, very complex.\"\nOne thing to understand up front is the difference between automatic and semiautomatic weapons.\nAutomatic weapons -- banned\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeremy \"Spike\" Cohen\n\n\nstated on January 22, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays the Biden administration labeled Libertarians terrorists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Czopek \u2022 January 22, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutomatic weapons -- sometimes known as fully automatic, or machine guns -- fire continuously when the trigger is held down.\nTwo federal laws have essentially banned them in the United States.\nOne law in 1935 all but banned automatic weapons like the Tommy gun. And another in 1986 prohibited fully automatic weapons, except for pre-existing weapons that were grandfathered in.\nSemiautomatic weapons -- not banned\nSemiautomatic weapons, like the rifle Mateen carried, reload automatically but fire only once each time the trigger is depressed.\nThey are not banned by federal law.\nFrom 1994 to 2004, there was a federal law\u00a0that banned the sale of certain types of new semiautomatic weapons, including some types of AR-15 rifles. A limit on high-capacity magazines also was set.\nThe law, which was adopted to last for 10 years, was not renewed by Congress when it expired.\nThe takeaway\nJohnson takes the position that only automatic weapons qualify as assault weapons. It\u2019s worth noting that in at least one\u00a0other interview\u00a0the same day \u2014 with conservative Green Bay radio talk show host Jerry Bader \u2014 he spelled that out, saying \"an assault weapon is a fully automatic.\"\u00a0\nHis office made the same argument to us, citing technical military definitions.\nHowever, that\u2019s not a generally accepted line of separation. The federal law that became defunct in 2004 was called the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, and at the time the Department of Justice defined some semiautomatic guns as assault weapons. A number of state laws still have that wording on their books. And law enforcement agencies consider certain semiautomatic weapons, including the one used by Mateen, as assault weapons \u2014 or at minimum, assault-style weapons.\nIndeed, the weapons used in the mass shootings in San Bernardino, Calif., Aurora, Colo. and Newtown, Conn. -- all of which were semiautomatic -- were all described by police as assault rifles.\nOur rating\nIn the wake of the mass shooting in Orlando, in which the killer used a semiautomatic rifle was used, Johnson stated: \"Assault rifles already are banned.\"\nSome, including Johnson, contend that only weapons that are automatic \u2014 firing continuously when the trigger is held down are assault weapons \u2014 are assault weapons. Those are essentially prohibited by federal laws. But that definition is narrow, and Johnson\u2019s claim gives a misleading impression of a comprehensive ban.\nLawmakers, law enforcement officials and others widely refer to many semiautomatic weapons like the rifle used in Orlando and other mass shootings \u2014 which reload automatically but fire only once each time the trigger is depressed \u2014 as assault weapons. Those are not banned by federal law.\nFor a statement that has an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04812"}
