Scott Walker boasted to a national cable TV audience that his 2011-\u201913 state budget ended the practice of pushing fiscal problems into the future.\nIn an June 2011 appearance on CNBC, Walker said his first budget \"wiped out\" a big shortfall and put in changes to avoid them in the future.\nNow, weeks before the Nov. 4, 2014 election, the governor is facing questions about his own shortfall projected for the 2015-\u201917 budget, caused in part by tax cuts he championed.\nAnd Walker is arguing the method behind a projected $1.8 billion shortfall is suspect.\n\"That $1.8 billion number you\u2019ve heard out there actually comes from an assumption based on zero growth,\" Walker said during the Oct. 17, 2014 debate, when challenged on the number by Democratic rival Mary Burke. \"That just doesn\u2019t happen.\"\nWe touched on this exchange when we rated False Walker\u2019s claim that there\u2019s actually a surplus, not a deficit, heading into 2015. We said that flies in the face of the official estimate that uses a long-established method used by members of both parties, and the governor\u2019s budget office.\nNow let\u2019s examine Walker\u2019s underlying critique -- that the $1.8 billion figure is based on zero growth, a scenario \"that just doesn\u2019t happen.\" It\u2019s his basis for turning to a different, much rosier, set of numbers.\nThe nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau is the source of the estimated $1.8 billion shortfall.\nAs we have explained, this is an estimate of the challenge budget-makers will face based on past decisions that they will have to pay for in the two years ahead.\nThat number is informally referred to as the \"structural deficit.\" But the figure does not reflect an actual \"deficit\" at the end of a budget year -- it\u2019s just a benchmark or starting point of what officials will have to account for as they make spending and tax decisions.\nWalker and lawmakers from both parties long have used the Fiscal Bureau methodology.\nLet\u2019s start where Walker did in his claim, saying the analysis is based on an assumption of \"zero growth\" in revenue. In Madison circles, it is well known that the Fiscal Bureau\u2019s method in this exercise is to assume no loss or gain in revenue -- and no changes in spending.\nIn the real world, of course, state tax revenue rises and falls, and lawmakers adjust spending according to those revenues.\nBy sticking to this method, the bureau\u2019s estimate is consistent, allowing budget makers to readily gauge how their actions will affect future budgets. Lawmakers often ask during budget debates how spending increases or tax cuts will affect the \"structural deficit\" in the next budget.\nGrowth history\nNow to Walker\u2019s stated problem with the zero-growth approach -- that such a scenario \"just doesn\u2019t happen.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we asked for backup, the Walker campaign referred us to the history of state revenue growth.\nTo check that, we went back to the 2001-\u201903 budget period and examined state revenue growth annually and for each two-year budget since then.\nWe found that zero growth happens. And it\u2019s even been worse than zero at times, owing usually to recessions and their effect on state tax revenue.\nIn the last 13 years, three individual fiscal years have dipped into negative territory.\n2002: - 0.4 percent\n2009: \u00a0- 7.1 percent\n2014: \u00a0\u00a0- 1 percent\nIn addition, the year 2010 saw essentially no growth -- a scant 0.15 percent bump up. (All years reflect state fiscal years ending in July.)\nThe two year budget (2007-\u201909) slammed by the Great Recession saw revenue plummet $505 million, mostly due to big fall-offs in income tax and sales tax payments.\nTotal revenue didn\u2019t return to 2007 levels until four years later\nIn Walker\u2019s time as governor, revenue growth topped 4 percent in each of his first two years.\nBut in 2013-\u201914, revenue fell by 1 percent, in part due to tax cuts he and Republican lawmakers enacted. The economic forecasts have not held up as planned either.\nWe won\u2019t know until mid-2015 whether the two-year budget will end with a decline in revenue as did the 2007-\u201909 budget. Forecasts are for growth in 2014-\u201915. But no matter what, the next governor and lawmakers by law must ensure it is balanced, through spending cuts or other means as necessary.\nOur rating\nWalker said the projected $1.8 billion state budget shortfall for 2015-\u201917 \"actually comes from an assumption based on zero growth. That just doesn\u2019t happen.\"\nThe calculation is based on zero growth, so there\u2019s an element of truth in Walker\u2019s claim.\nBut his main point was to make the zero-growth assumption seem unrealistic, and on that he misfired. Recent history, including one year under Walker, shows that negative or flat growth is not uncommon.\nWe rate his statement Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07097"}
