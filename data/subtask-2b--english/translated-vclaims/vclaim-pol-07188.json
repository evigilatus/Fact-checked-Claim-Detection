Mahir said that when Muslim nations suppress political rights and deny freedoms to women, homosexuals and minorities, they are a fair game of cruel criticism. The verbal joy is about whether Maher and others paint Islamic countries with a very wide brush. The U.S. Admiral White Allah said Maher went too far. \"You can criticize the Muslims,\" said the slaves of God in Ed's presentation on October 6. \"It's about doing it responsibly. Don't pick the facts and choose them to introduce us to our worst examples. Like Saudi Arabia, women can't drive. That's awful.\" However, Obaid Allah said, \"This is the only Islamic State out of 47 Muslim-majority States that do so.\" We thought we'd lower that number. We asked Obaid Allah and said not only that it was accurate within the Muslim world, but Saudi Arabia might be the only country throughout the world that did not allow women to lead. He referred to the story of NPR that the oil-rich nation saw this questionable distinction, although it made it clear that \"while there is no law formally prohibiting female drivers, the Government does not give them permits.\" Some Saudi women stand behind the wheel and stand in plain sight to challenge the country &apos; s policy. We have reviewed the list of Muslim-majority countries. From all we have found, Obaidullah is right about the unique status of Saudi Arabia. Another country that has prevented women from driving has not shown up. (For information, our list was 51 States, not 47.) There's another list of 49. But we're not gonna dodge that.) John Esposito is a leading expert in Islam and professor of international affairs and Islamic studies at Georgetown University. We asked him whether Saudi Arabia is the only Islamic Ummah to pursue this policy with regard to women. He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. By Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021 \"Yes,\" said Esposito. Even within Saudi Arabia's religious community, you can find arguments on both sides of the case. On the website of the question and answer to Islam, the justification for the prohibition lies in the Koran. The site operates under the supervision of Saudi Sheikh Mohammed Salieh Al-Manjad. \"It is well known that leadership leads to evil consequences that are well known to those who promote it, such as being alone with an unmarried woman, However, today &apos; s Islam site, another under the auspices of a different Saudi religious leader, Sheikh Abdul Wahab al-Tuuri, reaches a different conclusion. \"There is nothing in Islamic law that prevents women from driving a car,\" according to the website. \"In Saudi Arabia, the State considers it in the best interests of the people to enact laws restricting the driving of certain sectors of the population, which fall within the jurisdiction of the State. The Saudi Arabian law prohibiting women from driving is one such law. Therefore, it cannot be understood as an Islamic education.\" Clearly, the slaves of God support the second point of view. God's servants said: \"There is no basis in the Koran to prevent women from leading, or see another Muslim country do so.\" \"It's not a Muslim thing, it's a Saudi thing!\" Our rule is that Saudi Arabia is the only Muslim-majority nation that does not allow women to lead. According to our research and independent sources, that's true. We're assessing the claim right.
