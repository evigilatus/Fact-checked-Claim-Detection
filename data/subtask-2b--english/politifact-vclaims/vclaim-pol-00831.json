(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nTo compare the price tags, we broke down the costs for the border wall and healthcare.gov.\nBorder wall\u2019s price tag\nDuring his campaign, Trump priced the border wall at $6-$7 billion. Then he said that it would cost $10-$12 billion. But recent estimates indicate that it will cost more \u2014 how much more depends on the design, materials, and distance it will cover.\nAn internal report from the Department of Homeland Security described the barrier as a series of walls and fences that would cost $21.6 billion.\nRepublican leadership estimated that the border wall would require $12-$15 billion. Senate Democrats predicted a $70 billion price tag for a border wall and patrolling technology.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn his latest budget, Trump requested $8.6 billion in funding for the border wall in addition to the $12.9 billion that he could collect after declaring a national emergency. However, it\u2019s important to know that these funds aren\u2019t guaranteed.\nObamacare website\u2019s price tag\nPolitiFact previously looked into the costs of healthcare.gov, the website set up by the Affordable Care Act.\nDuring a Senate hearing in May 2014, then-Department of Health and Human Services Secretary-designate Sylvia Mathews Burwell said the expenses totaled $834 million.\nOur reporting found that the most liberal estimate is $2.1 billion, which came from a Bloomberg Government study that captured expenses beyond the scope of Burwell\u2019s estimate, including $387 million in other agencies\u2019 spending and a $300 million contract to process paper applications.\nWhy compare these projects?\nWe tried to find out more about the origins of this comparison. Breitbart published a related, but not identical, article that said annual spending on Obamacare exceeds the highest estimates for the border wall costs.\nHowever, the article used the costs for the entire program, not just its website. It also mentions that the \"website alone cost over $2 billion\" and links to another Breitbart article on the Bloomberg Government study.\nOur ruling\nWhatever cost of the border wall that you use \u2014 and it is vast, ranging from $12 billion to $70 billion \u2014 it far exceeds the cost of setting up the Obamacare website. The highest number we found for healthcare.gov was $2.1 billion.\nWe rate this statement False.\n Share the Facts 2019-04-01 13:18:28 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Valoraci\u00f3n: False  \"President Trump\u2019s wall costs less than the ObamaCare website.\"    User on Facebook https://www.facebook.com/Deplorables1/photos/a.310324979326029/823134408045081/?type=3&theater   In a viral image mi\u00e9rcoles, 20 de Marzo de 2019 2019-03-20    Lee m\u00e1s  Info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00831"}
