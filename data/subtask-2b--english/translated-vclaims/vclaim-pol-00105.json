(The Office of Justice did not respond to queries regarding this article.) The tweeting of justice was linked to a news release from the Governor &apos; s Office that cited the source of the classifications as the twenty-fourth annual report of the Consortium Highway Corporation. The Foundation for \"The Reason\" has a free perspective, including individual freedom and free markets, as the Foundation's website says. The annual highway study uses expenditure and performance data sent by state agencies to the Federal Government. To achieve this, 50 states are classified in 13 categories, such as highway expenses per mile, pavement conditions, overcrowding, bridge conditions and mortality rates. Given the overall state figures, West Virginia ranked sixteenth in the country, up by 20 percentage points from 36 in last year &apos; s survey. Compared to its neighbours, the report is found in the general order of West Virginia before Ohio (18) and Maryland (39), but behind Virginia (2). West Virginia does worse than some similar states regionally such as Kentucky (5th) but better than others such as Indiana (33d). The Upper State was North Dakota, and the worst was New Jersey. Read the complete list here. Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" \u2022 January 26, 2012, it should be noted that the general order in West Virginia in 16th place obscures some aspects of the report that paints a less pink picture of highways in the state. At the outset, the bulk of the highway data is in the most recent report covering 2016, which is before justice takes office. Only two categories of 13 use 2017 data, when his first term of office had begun. Therefore, while this report represents a positive development for West Virginia, it does not fully reflect the justice policies themselves, as he implied when he referred to \"all the hard work we have done.\" In addition, the technical change in the report &apos; s methodology has been instrumental in increasing West Virginia. According to the summary of the State ranking report, West Virginia \"no longer benefits from the report by measuring narrow rural arteries,\" the category in which the State ranked 50 last year. Finally, given only the general order, as does justice, some relatively weak estimates of West Virginia are obscured by major subcategories. It should be noted that the State ranks 36th in the total mortality rate, 48th in the structurally deficient bridges, 20th in the case of the interstate urban pier and 21th in the case of the interstate rural pier. The State has achieved better results in measuring costs, having ranked second in terms of total expenditure per mile and third in terms of capital costs and bridges per mile. \"To improve the order, West Virginia needs to reduce the percentage of its structurally deficient bridges and the state of its rural arterial pier,\" said Vegenbaum to Poletti Fact West Virginia. \"The state at the fifth bottom of the structurally deficient bridges and 15 below for the country's rural arterial pier.\" Our judge on Twitter wrote: \"Our WV highways ranked 16th in the country in a national survey of highway systems, rising to 20 spots of last year's arrangement! This arrangement confirms all the hard work we have done, and we continue to do, which is to reform the ways of our State.\" Justice has a point about the total number, but the tone of its celebration is somewhat exaggerated. Most of the data reflect a period before he became governor, and the main reason for the increase was the cancellation of a category of last year &apos; s report that ranked West Virginia 50th at the national level. The statement is partially accurate but leaves important details, so we evaluate it half right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00105"}
