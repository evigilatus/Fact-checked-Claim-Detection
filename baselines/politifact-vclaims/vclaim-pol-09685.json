They get in, LaPierre said, because \"the president flagrantly defies the 2006 federal law ordering the construction of a secure border fence along the entire Mexican border.\"\n\nFlagrant defiance? We decided to examine whether it\u2019s true that President Barack Obama is bucking a law requiring construction of a such a fence.\n\nSecure Fence Act of 2006\n\nWe did not hear back from the NRA for this story. But the 2006 law directing fence construction is the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which was passed by a Republican-led Congress and signed by President George W. Bush. It authorized the construction of hundreds of miles of additional fencing along the border with Mexico. The act specified \"at least two layers of reinforced fencing.\"\n\nOne thing it did not do: require a fence to be built \"along the entire Mexican border,\" as LaPierre claimed. Instead, it directed that specific segments of the border -- \"extending from 10 miles west of the Tecate, California, port of entry to 10 miles east of the Tecate, California, port of entry,\" for example -- be double-fenced. The fenced segments totaled roughly 650-700 miles, while the entire U.S.-Mexican border is about 2,000 miles long.\n\nObama, an Illinois senator at the time, voted for the law.\n\nThe following year, the legislation underwent a significant change. Officials at the Department of Homeland Security argued that different border terrains required different types of fencing -- that a one-size-fits-all approach across the entire border didn't make sense.\n\nSen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, proposed an amendment to give DHS the discretion to decide what type of fence was appropriate in different areas. The law was amended to read, \"nothing in this paragraph shall require the Secretary of Homeland Security to install fencing, physical barriers, roads, lighting, cameras, and sensors in a particular location along an international border of the United States, if the Secretary determines that the use or placement of such resources is not the most appropriate means to achieve and maintain operational control over the international border at such location.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIn other words, Border Patrol would use its discretion to decide which type of fencing was appropriate in various regions. The amendment was included in a federal budget bill in late 2007.\n\nHutchison said at the time, \"Border patrol agents reported that coyotes and drug-runners were altering their routes as fencing was deployed, so the amendment gives our agents discretion to locate the fence where necessary to achieve operational control of our border.\" Opponents, however, said the amendment effectively killed the border fence promised in the 2006 bill.\n\nToday, DHS says Border Patrol has completed 651 miles of fencing, including 299 miles of vehicle fence and 352 miles of primary pedestrian fence. One mile of pedestrian fence is left to complete, and it is tied up in litigation.\n\nSo what\u2019s being flagrantly defied?\n\nThat comes down to the difference between vehicle fence and pedestrian fence, as well as the \"double layer\" specification in the 2006 law.\n\nOn the one hand, the fence is virtually complete and in compliance with the 2007 amendment.\n\n\"It cost almost $3 million per mile to construct that fence. Including maintenance, it is supposed to cost over $6 billion over the next 20 years. President Obama is going above and beyond any president ever at enforcing our immigration laws,\" said Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute.\n\nOn the other, it\u2019s not the fence envisioned in 2006. For one thing, vehicle fencing would be more accurately described as posts placed close enough together that cars can\u2019t be driven between them.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, just 36.3 miles of fencing are double-layered.\n\nSaid Rosemary Jenks with Numbers USA, a Washington group that favors low levels of immigration: \"The Secure Fence Act called for 650 miles of double-layer pedestrian fencing. While the administration claims to have completed 650 miles of fencing, virtually none of it is double layer, and several hundred miles is vehicle barriers, instead of fence at all.\"\n\nOther resources, practical considerations\n\nWhile LaPierre was specific about fence construction, we thought we\u2019d mention other aspects of border control.\n\nRey Koslowski, in a 2011 paper for the Migration Policy Institute, noted that the Southwest Border Security Act Obama signed in 2010 appropriated $600 million for enhanced border protection on top of the president\u2019s July 2010 authorization to deploy 1,200 National Guard troops to the border. The largest share of the additional funding, $244 million, was to hire and maintain existing levels of Border Patrol agents and customs officers. Almost $200 million went to the Department of Justice to hire more federal law enforcement officers for the southwest border region, and still millions more went to communications and aerial surveillance equipment.\n\nIn an interview, Koslowski pointed out that the 2006 law required that no more than 18 months after its enactment the government should have \"operational control\" of the border. How was that defined? \"The prevention of all unlawful entries into the United States.\"\n\n\"Well, guess what, they failed,\" Koslowski said. \"Under this definition, no country, not even East Germany, managed operational control like this.\"\n\nSo the fence -- pedestrian and vehicle -- is an adaptation to changing immigration patterns, from population centers where people used to walk in, out to deserts and mountains where they drive across.\n\nAdded Gordon Hanson, an economist at University of California, San Diego: \"It simply doesn\u2019t make economic sense to build a fence along the entire border; in desert/mountain regions there are far more efficient ways to block entry than a fence in the middle of nowhere.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nLaPierre wrote that \"the president flagrantly defies the 2006 federal law ordering the construction of a secure border fence along the entire Mexican border.\"\n\nFirst, he misrepresented what the law required, which was segments of fencing in specific places, not a continuous fence along the 2,000 mile border. Second, he ignored the 2007 amendment which gave the government some discretion over how to build the fence.\n\nThe fence that has been built -- just one mile short of what\u2019s required -- is a combination of pedestrian fencing and vehicle barriers. To some critics that does not satisfy what Congress intended in 2006, and very little of it is double-layered. On that point, we think LaPierre\u2019s statement contains a grain of truth.\n\nOtherwise, though, it\u2019s clear that Obama is not flagrantly defying the law, especially as resources toward other aspects of border enforcement are increasing.\n\nWe rate LaPierre\u2019s statement Mostly False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09685"}
