Or more specifically, she cannot stop blaming her voting system for her election defeat in 2016. The former democratic presidential candidate repeatedly criticized the State Voter Identity Act, which was in force for the first time in the elections that led Clinton against Republican Donald Trump. It has repeatedly found itself inconsistent with the facts. In May 2017, Clinton claimed that 200,000 people in Wisconsin were \"either denied or frozen in their efforts to vote.\" We've often misjudged that. In March 2019, she then claimed that \"somewhere between 40,000 and 80,000 people were removed from the ballot box (in 2016) because of their skin colour\" and other factors. This was far from true and attracted pants to the classification of fire. Clinton returned to the subject on September 17, 2019, in a speech at George Washington University. I have stated the reasons \"You can win the popular vote and you can lose the electoral college,\" starting with what you call the repression of voters. \"Experts estimate that anywhere from 27,000 to 200,000 citizens of Wisconsin, most of whom are in Milwaukee, have been removed from the polls,\" said Clinton. \"This is a lot of potential voters. They showed up, but they probably didn't have the right form to identify. Perhaps the name on their driver &apos; s licence contained a middle name or a first name that was not included in the voter registration. But the officials made every excuse in the book to prevent some people from voting in those elections.\" There are a lot of people who should \"get away\" from the polls. So let's summarize this. Again. A corrupting warning: Clinton's numbers are still inaccurate. According to studies, the Clinton team did not respond to our request for evidence, but the vastly different numbers I mentioned - 27,000 and 200,000 - reflect almost two analyses of the impact of voter identification cards in the 2016 elections. Even a lower party from this range, if true, could have made a significant difference. Clinton and Wisconsin lost about 22,000 votes from about 2.8 million votes. Wisconsin turned to the Republican side - one of the main reasons why Trump won the election. In a May 2017 report commissioned by the United States Priority Action Organization, a political action committee that supported Clinton and Barack Obama, it considered changes in the number of voters who voted and linked them to changes in the voter identity law. They said that the turnout increased by 1.3% from 2012 to 2016 in the states with no change in voter identification laws, but in Wisconsin it decreased by 3.3%. If Wisconsin's turnout rose instead by 1.3%, priorities in the United States of America estimated that it would generate another 200,000 votes. The analysis called this \"the theory of 200,000 missing voters.\" However, this is very different from the classification of certain people as \"dismissed\" from the ballot box, as Clinton claimed. In any case, the 200,000 have their own problems. The experts we quoted in the previous fact-finding exercises stated that it was not reasonable to attribute all the changes in turnout to the voter identity law when public enthusiasm - including Clinton's candidacy - and other factors played an unquestionable role. The University of Wisconsin has carried out a study that could be what Clinton relied on at the lower end of the range. The survey included 293 registered voters who did not vote in the provinces of Dan and Milwaukee in the 2016 elections. On January 10, 2021, in a television interview, \"It takes a long time on election day to download those cards, which is why we have 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. to throw the ballot papers at Milwaukee.\" \u2022 15 January 2021, the study estimated that a total of 12,000 registered persons had been affected by the requirement of identity cards in these provinces. However, according to the author, his findings are in no way consistent with Clinton &apos; s formulation of her claim. \"Our procedure captures people who say they've been deported, but also people who didn't bother because they didn't think they could vote,\" Kenneth R. Mayer, Professor of American Politics at Washington University, told Polyte Fact Wisconsin. \"Our estimate is that it is reasonable to believe that the voter identity law has reduced public turnout somewhere within 1% in these districts, but that does not make you anywhere close to the numbers (Clinton).\" A press release released by the study also indicated that most respondents said that they did not vote because they lacked identity \"in fact had a qualified form of identity.\" This makes it even more ridiculous to bring these people together in the category of \"dismissal\" as Clinton did, since they wouldn't actually be deported on the identity card if they went to the polls. How many were really \"rounded \"? Mayer said he saw reports of people being deported, and he studied WW University and asked people if it was happening to them. According to the study, 1.4 per cent of those surveyed said that they had been told at a polling station that their identity cards were insufficient. This will be four out of 293. \"It was small enough that we considered it intangible for a comprehensive conclusion,\" said Meyer. It is difficult to get tighter numbers. The Wisconsin Election Commission reported that 821 temporary identity card ballots were cast throughout the state in the 2016 elections. These are the people who showed up without a proper identity, but they voted anyway. If the person continues to submit the correct identity card by Friday after the election, the ballot shall then be counted. Not everyone who shows up without an ID will make such a vote, of course. However, this is a measure of the high incidence of identity issues in the ballot boxes. Mayer said we simply didn't know how many people were deported. But he said Clinton's number wasn't real. He said: \"There is no possibility of this happening (200,000), as this would have been in the range of 60 persons per polling place,\" referring to approximately 3,500 polling sites in the state. Will Flanders, Director of Research at the Governor of the Wisconsin Institute of Law and Freedom, criticized the UW survey for having a small sample and focusing only on the strongholds of democracy, among other elements. This made Clinton's findings more extreme. \"In view of the problematic nature of that estimate (UW), estimates that are even greater are beyond reasonable probability,\" Flanders Poletti Fact Wisconsin said. Our referee, Clinton, said that between 27,000 and 200,000 Wisconsin residents were \"distracted\" from the 2016 polls because there was no proper identification. But studies that examine the identity of voters here say nothing like that. They widely looked at how voter turnout had changed - which included the much larger number that simply stayed away. Experts say that there is no reliable figure for the number of people who have been physically deported, but the current work leaves no doubt that it is far below the range mentioned by Clinton. This is the third time that we have assessed the claims of Clinton to Iqbal Wisconsin. It is no closer to this time than to the last. We're assessing this pants claim on fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00144"}
