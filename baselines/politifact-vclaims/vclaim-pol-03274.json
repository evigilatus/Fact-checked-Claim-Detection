He\u2019s right about the four-decade gap, but it takes a long time to build a big ship (it\u2019s just one -- not plural as he said) and the plan for this ship has been underway for some time.\nAssessing the fleet\nAn\u00a0icebreaker can carve a path through thick sheets of ice in frozen regions of the world or to access research stations in the Arctic. The bigger the ship, the thicker the ice it can handle.\nThe United States has just one active heavy polar icebreaker,\u00a0the Polar Star, which entered service in 1976. At a speed of 3 knots it can break through ice as thick as 21 feet. A similar ship was mothballed after its engined died in 2010\nIn addition to the Polar Star, the country has medium icebreaker, Healy, and the National Science Foundation operates a small icebreaker named Palmer.\nThe construction of a new, heavy icebreaker would indeed be the first for the United States in four decades, said Magnus Nordenman, director of the Transatlantic Security Initiative at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Brent Scowcroft Center on International Security.\nIn the works for a few years\nTrump left out a key fact: The process of building a new heavy icebreaker for the Coast Guard began before he took office.\nThe U.S. Coast Guard told us the work began in earnest during President Barack Obama\u2019s second term.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The time needed to build a new icebreaker can anywhere be between 5 to 10 years,\" said Sherri Goodman, a former defence official and senior fellow with the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.\nThe Coast Guard included it in its 2012-13 budget submission, according to the Congressional Research Service.\nThe project received about $15.6 million through FY 2016.\nIn FY 2017, Congress gave the Coast Guard $25 million to manage the project and $150 million went to the Navy to start the design and construction process.\nRight now, actual building is slated to start in 2020 and if all goes well, the ship will launch in 2023.\nOur ruling\nTrump said, \"I\u2019m proud to say that under my administration, as you just heard, we will be building the first new heavy icebreakers the United States has seen in over 40 years.\"\nHe has a point that the heavy icebreaker being built is the first \u00a0since the 1970s.\nIf all goes according to schedule, construction will begin in 2020 with delivery in 2023. That puts the building phase within his first term, but as with any large project, the timeline can slip.\nRegardless, this has been an ongoing project that has been receiving funding from the government since 2013.\nTrump\u2019s statement implied that the efforts to build the icebreaker came from his administration when in fact it was already in progress before he took office.
