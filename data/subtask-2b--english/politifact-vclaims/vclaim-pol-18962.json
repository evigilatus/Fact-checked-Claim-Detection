Ted Cruz calls for a criminal investigation into Netflix film 'Cuties.'\"\u00a0\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nNetflix\u2019s CEO has not been charged with these crimes. The claims have been debunked several times, but some social media users continue to spread the misinformation.\u00a0\nNetflix CEO\nFirst, the claim incorrectly identifies Netflix\u2019s CEO. Reed Hastings is the CEO and co-founder of Netflix.\nPolitiFact searched news archives and found no evidence that Hastings had been charged with any crime.\nIt\u2019s not clear where the name \u2018Kim Martin Morrow\u2019 originated; our searches find it solely used with these inaccurate claims. Not one of Netflix\u2019s eight senior officers or 12 directors is named Kim Martin Morrow.\nSo why are social media users falsely linking a fake Netflix CEO to child pornography charges? That\u2019s a bit complicated.\nChild pornography claims\nThe child pornography claims come after Netflix\u2019s release of the French film \u2018Cuties\u2019 was met with criticism from subscribers and other internet users.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany say the film inappropriately sexualizes girls as young as 11, leading internet users to call for subscribers to #CancelNetflix.\nNetflix has defended the film.\u00a0\n\"\u2018Cuties\u2019 is a social commentary against the sexualization of young children,\" a spokesperson said in a statement to Variety. \"It\u2019s an award-winning film and a powerful story about the pressure young girls face on social media and from society more generally growing up \u2014 and we\u2019d encourage anyone who cares about these important issues to watch the movie.\"\nFilm director Ma\u00efmouna Doucour\u00e9, who won a directing award at Sundance for \u2018Cuties,\u2019 maintains that her film criticizes, rather than promotes, hypsersexualization of children.\u00a0\n\"I\u2019m eager to see their reaction when they realize that we\u2019re both on the same side of this fight against young children\u2019s hypersexualization,\" Doucour\u00e9 said of critics during an interview.\u00a0\nThe Instagram post we\u2019re checking also uses the \"SaveOurChildren\" hashtag, which is linked to the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory. QAnon followers promote the belief that President Donald Trump is working covertly to bring down a child trafficking ring organized by popular celebrities and prominent Democrats. The FBI considers QAnon a potential domestic terrorism threat.\nBut airing a controversial film is not a crime, and Netflix\u2019s CEO hasn\u2019t been charged with any, as the post claims.\nOur ruling\nSocial media posts claim, \"Kim Martin Morrow the CEO of Netflix has just been charged with 15 charges for child pornography.\"\nNetflix\u2019s CEO is Reed Hastings, and he has not been charged with any crime. The claims appear to be the result of backlash over a Netflix film that many say hypersexualizes young children.\nWe rate this claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18962"}
