At least three fact-checks have debunked this claim.\nAlso, these service members were not all U.S. Marines.\nWe downloaded from the federal Defense Casualty Analysis System a list of the casualties in Operation Enduring Freedom, which was launched in Afghanistan in October 2001 after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\nHere from that list is the name, age and hometown of each man in the Facebook post:\nEight members of the U.S. Army:\u00a0\nJustin Allen, 23, Coal Grove, Ohio\nZachary Fisher, 24, Ballwin, Mo.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.
