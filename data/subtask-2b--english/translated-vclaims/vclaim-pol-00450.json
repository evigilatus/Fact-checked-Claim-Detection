And not all of them are new - or even completely artificial. On July 8, a Facebook page called \"National Rogue\" published a picture of people sitting on the sidewalk looking at their cell phones. The written text of the photograph claims that the photographers are immigrants. \"The inevitable question is, how did you all pay your cell phone bills during your painful two-month journey across four separate countries?\" The mail reads. The Mim benefits from the national dialogue on the surge in migrants at the United States-Mexico border. It was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The Rogue Patriot site, which collected more than 1,200 shares, does not include a source either in the meme or in the commentary. Nothing in the picture immediately makes it clear that those images are in fact immigrants. :: Polyte Fact contacted Rogue Patriot for more information on the source of the photo, and directed us to the story of Associated Press published on March 27, 2017. The picture in question appears to be included in the text with the following address: \"The Cubans examine their cell phones inside the Casa del Hagar immigration shelter in Nuevo Laredo, State of Tamaulipas, Mexico, Saturday, 25 March 2017, across the border from Laredo, Texas. The shelter limits the use of one hour of mobile phones by immigrants for security reasons.\" The AP story deals with the so-called \"wet foot, dry foot\" policy, which ended former President Barack Obama January 12, 2017. This policy, developed by former President Bill Clinton in 1995, allowed most Cubans who had arrived in United States territory to become legal permanent residents after one year. Once this situation is over, Cuban migrants are treated in the same way as migrants from other countries. On January 12, 2021, he wrote in an Instagram article saying that Joe Biden remained silent about the violence in Black Lives-Mite protests. According to AP reports, many of the immigrants in the Casa del shelter were Cuban immigrants who tried to travel to the United States on the assumption that they would be included in the \"private track\" defined by Clinton's policy. Many of them have jobs in Mexico that require them to leave the shelter to work at restaurants or construction sites. This context is different from that in which the \"Rogue patriot\" spread his idea. The Society met one of the immigrants who crossed several borders to reach Mexico, but based on the picture alone, it is unclear which people actually imagined \"a two-month trip across four separate countries.\" Similar versions of this Mimi appeared during the previous news on immigration. In December, Snoops examined the reality of Mimi who used the same AP photo with a radiant text similar to Roge Patriot. It found that the mail was ill-headed because it allegedly showed asylum-seekers who were part of a convoy of Central American immigrants heading to the American border. Finally, it should be noted that it is not unusual for the poor or even the displaced to own cell phones, whether in the United States or around the world. For example, the Gates Foundation has promoted the acquisition of mobile phones in Africa, Asia and Latin America to enable low-income people in developing countries to access financial services through electronic banks. Our ruling (Rog Patriot) claimed that the picture showed that immigrants were \"able to pay cell phone bills\" after \"a two-month trip across four separate countries.\" This picture was taken by the Parliamentary Assembly in 2017 for a story of Cuban immigrants excluded from the amnesty policy of the Clinton era. This context is different from the one in which the \"Rogue patriot\" Meme published similar allegations by other fact-checkers in the past. We're assessing this allegation mostly wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00450"}
