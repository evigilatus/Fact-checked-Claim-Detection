He should be running for office.", "text": "There is no evidence that Hillary Clinton once said she wanted to see \"persons like Donald Trump running for office.\" The widely dismantled allegations contain a picture of Clinton standing next to Trump. Under this picture, there is a text that says: \"Hilary Clinton in 2013: \"I would like to see people like Donald Trump running for office; they're honest and they can't be bought.\" Clinton didn't say that. This is a fabricated quote that has been published on Facebook and websites linked to irony and deception for years. The article was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The picture associated with the claim is from the 2005 Donald and Melania Trump wedding, attended by Clinton. The quote is an offer from Clinton &apos; s speech to Goldman Sachs in 2013. WikiLeaks published a copy of the alleged letter, publishing stolen e-mails from John Bodista, director of the 2016 Clinton presidential campaign. In 2016, NPR stated that the Clinton campaign refused to verify the authenticity of the documents. On January 12, 2021 Clinton, according to WikiLeaks' book in the 2013 Goldman Sachs speech, it was asked whether there was a need for \"comprehensive change\" in Washington in terms of people running for office. Clinton's response: \"That's a really interesting question. I'd like to see more successful businessmen running for office. I'd really like to see that because I think you don't have to get 30 billion, but you have a certain level of freedom. There's that unforgettable phrase from a former senator: you can probably rent but never buy.\" The text does not mention that Clinton specifically named Trump. As Snoppes and Factch.org noted, the quote attributed to Clinton stems from sites that claim to be \"hygienic\" from news and sarcasm. Clinton didn't say: \"I'd like to see people like Donald Trump running for office; they're honest and they can't be bought.\" We're assessing that fabricated quote as wrong.
