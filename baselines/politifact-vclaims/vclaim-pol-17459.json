Bush aboard after attending the NASCAR Nextel Cup Daytona 500 on Feb. 15, 2004, at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Fla.\"\nSeveral commenters believed it showed President Trump\u2019s visit and the crowd during this year\u2019s race, and for good reason. George W. Bush is the only other president to attend the event.\u00a0\nPresidents George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan attended the Pepsi 400, which is held at the Daytona International Speedway in the summer.\u00a0\nLike Trump, the younger Bush served as the race\u2019s grand marshal and was also seeking re-election at the time of his visit.\nNevertheless, this photo is missing context: It\u2019s over 15 years old and two presidents removed from Trump.
