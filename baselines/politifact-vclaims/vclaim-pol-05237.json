The venture is a limited liability corporation, and its owners are not a matter of public record.\nThat point aside, let\u2019s move to the focus of this Truth-O-Meter: Is the winery really the largest on the East Coast, as Trump claimed? We emailed his campaign three times seeking backup for the statement but didn\u2019t hear back. So we began our own investigation.\nFirst, we contacted the Virginia Wine Board, a panel created by the Virginia General Assembly to promote state wineries and vineyards. Annette Boyd, the board\u2019s director, said Trump Winery has planted 200 acres of vines. By that measure, called \"acres under vine,\" Boyd said Trump Winery has the largest vineyard in Virginia.\nThe Trump Winery website, citing the same 200-acre figure, also says it\u2019s the largest vineyard in the state. It additionally claims that it\u2019s the largest \"vinifera vineyard\" on the East Coast, referring to a species of grape.\nBut the website never goes as far as Donald Trump did in making an unconditional claim that the winery is the largest on the East Coast. He\u2019s made that statement a number of times.\nSeveral wine industry analysts told us that when calculating a winery\u2019s size, the best measure is not the acreage of vines that have been planted - it\u2019s the volume of wine produced. By that standard, wine experts told us there\u2019s no way Trump Winery is the biggest on the East Coast.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That\u2019s not correct,\" Michael Kaiser, spokesman for the National Association of American Wineries, told us about Trump\u2019s claim.\nIn fact, by that measure Trump Winery is not even the largest in Virginia. The Trump Winery produces about 36,000 cases of wine each year, according to Boyd. The top producers in the state are the Williamsburg Winery and Chateau Morrisette in Floyd County -- each making about 60,000 cases a year, Boyd said. Barboursville Winery in Orange County, meanwhile, makes about 37,000 cases a year, Boyd said.\nIt\u2019s not hard to find wineries along the East Coast that make even more. Duplin Winery in Rose Hill, N.C., produces about 390,000 cases of sweet wine a year, Dave Fussell Jr., Duplin\u2019s president, told us in an email.\nDuplin, on its website, claims to be the \"largest winery in the South.\" Its grapes come from more than 1,000 acres, the vast majority from farmers who grow them off-site.\nThe Biltmore Winery in Asheville, N.C., says on its website that it produces about 150,000 cases of wine a year.\nLastly, we wondered whether there are wineries on the East Coast that have more grapes than Trump Winery\u2019s 200 acres of vines. The answer is yes.\nThe Wagner Vineyards Estate Winery in the Finger Lakes region of New York says it cultivates 250 acres of grapes (and makes 50,000 cases of wine a year). The vineyard manager at Pindar Vineyards on New York\u2019s Long Island said in a November 2015 interview that its vineyard has more than 300 acres of grapes. Pindar says it makes 70,000 cases of wine a year.\nOur ruling\nTrump said that Trump Winery is the \"largest winery on the East Coast.\" It\u2019s not, regardless of whether you measure it by acreage of vines or the production of wine.\nWe rate Trump\u2019s statement False.
