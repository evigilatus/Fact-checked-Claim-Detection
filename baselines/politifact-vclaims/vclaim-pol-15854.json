Dick Durbin, Jan. 13, 2009\n\n\n\nSo how did embattled Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich\u2019s pick to fill Barack Obama\u2019s vacated Senate seat go from \u2014 in Reid\u2019s words \u2014 a \u201ctainted appointment\u201d to one welcomed to the Senate as a \u201ccolleague and a friend\"? Suffice to say some things changed in the two weeks between these statements.\n\n\nThe first statement came as Blagojevich defiantly appointed Burris, despite charges that the governor had attempted to trade the appointment for personal gain. Although there was no suggestion that Burris was ever involved in Blagojevich\u2019s scheme, Senate Democratic leaders headed by Reid considered any appointment from Blagojevich \u201ctainted\u201d and vowed to block it.\n\n\nReid explained the Senate Democrats\u2019 initial hard line in a news conference on Jan. 7.\n\n\n\u201cThe reason Barack Obama joined with us in the first letter and certainly the statements made subsequent to that, that this nomination is tainted, because if you know anything about this, it doesn\u2019t look very good.\n\n\n\u201cBlagojevich, who was arrested at his home, going to work one morning, for trying to sell the office. We\u2019ve seen, time and time again, in print and before the electronic media, the crude language of Blagojevich, saying this is an \u2018effin gold mine, I\u2019ve got to get anything I can out of it.\u2019\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHow are we supposed to react? We reacted in a very reasonable way.\u201d\n\n\nBut cracks in Reid\u2019s seemingly entrenched stance began to appear just days after the first statement.\n\n\nIn a\n\nMeet the Press\n\ninterview on Jan. 4, host David Gregory asked if there weren\u2019t \u201croom here to negotiate and actually seat Burris.\u201d Reid responded, \u201cI\u2019m an old trial lawyer. There\u2019s always room to negotiate.\u201d\n\n\nLegally, a few things fell Burris\u2019 way. For one, the Illinois Supreme Court ruled that the appointment was valid. Another hurdle was cleared when Illinois Secretary of State Jesse White wrote a letter validating the appointment. Senate Democratic leaders had initially pinned some of their legal opposition to the Burris appointment on the fact that White had not signed off on the appointment.\n\n\nIn addition, Burris appeared before the Illinois House Committee on Impeachment and testified that he had never offered Blogojevich anything in return for his appointment.\n\n\nSenate Democratic leaders also found themselves facing mounting pressure from other Democrats, particularly the Congressional Black Caucus, to seat Burris.\n\n\nSenate Democratic leadership relented and eventually backed Burris. He was sworn in on Jan. 15, and, like Obama was, will be the only African-American serving in the U.S. Senate.\n\n\n\u201cThere are many paths to the United States Senate,\u201d Reid said from the floor on Jan. 15. \u201cIt is fair to say that the path that brought our new colleague from Illinois to us was unique.\n\n\n\"Senator Burris, on behalf of all senators, we welcome you as a colleague and a friend.\"\n\n\nWhether political pressure, a realization of legal inevitability or the change in Burris' credentials was the tipping point, the fact is that Reid and other Senate Democratic leaders drew a line in the sand and then, two weeks later, did an about-face. Think of it this way: Who wants to bet Republicans won\u2019t use video clips of Reid\u2019s earlier statements when the Burris seat comes up for election in 2010? We call Reid\u2019s position a Full Flop.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-15854"}
