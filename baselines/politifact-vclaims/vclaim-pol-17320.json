Roy Cooper \"has not left the Governor's Mansion since the start of the #COVID19 crisis.\"", "truth_label": "pants-fire", "date": "stated on December 27, 2020 in a tweet:", "title": "NC GOP wrong about Roy Cooper staying in mansion", "text": "Add North Carolina\u2019s governor to the list of politicians accused of hiding from the public.\nDuring campaign season, Republicans on several occasions accused Democrats of hiding in their basements amid the coronavirus pandemic. That trend continued the Sunday after Christmas, when the North Carolina GOP tweeted about Gov. Roy Cooper.\n\"Democrat Governor @RoyCooperNC has not left the Governor's Mansion since the start of the #COVID19 crisis,\" the party tweeted on Dec. 27.\nCompared to similar claims and barbs, this particular tweet stood out.\nFor one, North Carolina\u2019s gubernatorial race is over. Incumbent Cooper defeated Republican Dan Forest by about 250,000 votes \u2014 or about 4 percentage points \u2014 over a month ago. Second, the North Carolina Republican Party\u2019s claim is very specific.\u00a0\nSo is it true that Cooper hasn\u2019t left the Governor\u2019s Mansion in Raleigh since March, when the pandemic started?\nNo. There are numerous examples of Cooper leaving the executive mansion.\nOn Dec. 21, less than a week before the NC GOP\u2019s tweet, Cooper visited Duke Hospital to see health care workers receive COVID-19 vaccinations. He did the same at UNC Hospital in Chapel Hill on Dec. 17.\nEarlier this month, he toured a factory in Pittsboro that makes personal protective equipment. And in November, he toured a face shield production line.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCooper met with residents in August, when he visited Windsor in Bertie County after the town was hit by a tornado.\nHe has held multiple press conferences about the coronavirus pandemic from the Emergency Management building across town from the executive mansion.\nCooper also made a couple of high-profile appearances on the campaign trail in October, debating Forest at a studio in Research Triangle Park and greeting Joe Biden at RDU-International Airport.\nWe know the NC GOP is aware of Cooper\u2019s trip to the airport because it issued a press release about his conversation with Biden.\nThe list of trips in this fact-check is not comprehensive. So why did the NC GOP tweet that Cooper hasn\u2019t left his house?\nParty spokesman Tim Wigginton told PolitiFact NC that the tweet is not meant to be taken literally.\n\"The tweet is meant metaphorically,\" Wigginton said, adding that it\u2019s meant to critique the frequency of Cooper\u2019s visits with business owners. He accused Cooper of living \"in a bubble \u2026 instead of meeting with people devastated by his orders.\"\u00a0\nThe NC GOP\u2019s tweet gave no indication that the party was calling on Cooper to meet with business owners.\nOur ruling\nThe NC GOP tweeted that Cooper \"has not left the Governor's Mansion since the start of the (COVID-19) crisis.\"\u00a0\nThat\u2019s not only false, the party knows it\u2019s false. Cooper has left the mansion numerous times since March, and made many public appearances. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17320"}
