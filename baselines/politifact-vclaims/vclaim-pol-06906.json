Russia\u2019s Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, seems to think so.\nIt isn\u2019t often that comments made by Russia\u2019s foreign minister during an interview with French TV generate enough interest to catch PolitiFact\u2019s eye. But a recent claim by Lavrov -- originally made to the France 24 channel, then repeated in a New York Times dispatch about Russia\u2019s floundering currency -- caught the eye of several PolitiFact readers. In turn, they asked us to fact-check it.\nThe claim came at about the 15-minute mark in the English-language interview Lavrov gave to France 24\u2019s Marc Perelman on Dec. 16, 2014. Perelman asked Lavrov for his reaction to unanimous votes by the U.S. House and Senate to pass the Ukraine Freedom Support Act of 2014. That measure authorizes (but stops short of requiring) military\u00a0assistance for Ukraine\u00a0as well as significant new sanctions on Russia\u2019s energy sector, according to Bloomberg.\nLavrov dismissed the measure and proceeded to tweak the legislative institutions that passed it.\n\"Congress is a very special group of people,\" Lavrov said. \"More than 80 percent of them never left the United States. They live in their own walls. So I\u2019m not amazed about this Russophobia which is being displayed by the Congress at the moment.\"\nLavrov didn\u2019t look like he was joking in the interview, so we\u2019re taking the claim at face value. Here\u2019s what we found. (An inquiry to the Russian Embassy in Washington was not returned.)\nBecause calling up all 535 members of the House and Senate and asking them about their lifetime travel histories would be prohibitively time-consuming, we figured the fastest way to test Lavrov\u2019s claim would be to look at lawmakers\u2019 records of official travel.\nWe asked Jock Friedly, founder of the legislative data service LegiStorm, to run some numbers for us. Utilizing his database, Friedly found that no fewer than 412 voting House members and senators in the 113th Congress -- the one that just wrapped up its business this week -- have taken privately financed overseas travel during their congressional career, at least going back to 2000. (See LegiStorm\u2019s whole list here.)\nThat means that at least 77 percent of Congress\u2019 535 members (House and Senate combined) have gone overseas solely by counting one type of congressional travel -- namely, trips financed by outside organizations.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJake Tapper\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in remarks in a CNN broadcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second presidential impeachment of Donald Trump was \u201cthe most bipartisan impeachment in American history.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe LegiStorm figure doesn\u2019t include official congressional delegations (commonly known as CODELs) that take trips paid for using funds from the federal treasury. We took a quick look through some of the recent CODEL disclosures by the Clerk of the House and found that just in the final six months of 2013, at least 115 House members went on a CODEL. That\u2019s 26 percent of the chamber going overseas just during one quarter of a two-year congressional term. (See the whole list here.)\nWe cross-checked the two lists and found 20 House members who took a CODEL during that six-month period but had never taken a privately financed overseas trip. So that raised the number of confirmed members of Congress who had gone overseas at least once to 432 out of 535 members, or 81 percent.\nIn other words, Lavrov got the percentage who had gone overseas almost exactly backwards.\nIn reality, it\u2019s probably low-balling it to say that 81 percent of lawmakers have made overseas travel. We are confident that the percentage would rise even higher if we had included a longer-term sample of CODELs, if we had counted travel paid by a foreign government (trips that are regulated under the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act), and if we had counted trips sponsored by lawmakers\u2019 campaigns or political action committees.\n\"I think it\u2019s likely to be close to 100 percent who have done official travel of some kind overseas,\" Friedly told PolitiFact.\nAnd of course, none of these numbers touch any foreign travel taken in the lawmakers\u2019 personal lives, either as children or adults.\nOur ruling\nLavrov said, \"Congress is a very special group of people. More than 80 percent of them never left the United States.\"\nActually, the data shows that at least 81 percent of members in the recently concluded Congress have taken overseas trips on official business, and the actual percentage is almost certainly higher\u00a0once all sorts of travel are included, including personal travel completed before being elected to Congress.\nWe rate his claim Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06906"}
