He criticized members of his own party for spending too much\nand said the United States is too dependent on foreign oil.\n\n\"It doesn't make sense to me to send $1-billion a day out of our\ncountry,\" Romney said. \"We can be energy independent and should be.\"\n\n\nEveryone agrees with Romney that U.S. dependence on foreign oil is not a\ngood thing. But that's where the accuracy of his comment ends, experts say.\n\n\nIf Romney had said we \"should\" be energy independent he might be able to get\naway with it. But he chooses to be more emphatic, saying we \"can\" be. At the moment, that's not so.\n\n\nAmerican presidents have been promising to make the United States more fuel-independent for decades, says Mike Rodgers, a leading oil expert with\nPFC Energy in Washington. When Richard Nixon made that pledge during\nthe Arab oil embargo in 1973, Rodgers says the United States relied on foreign oil\nfor 35 percent of its daily consumption. Now, 34 years later, the United States gets more than 60 percent of its energy from foreign oil supplies.\n\n\nElectricity needs are not the issue. A combination of hydroelectricity, nuclear power and coal makes the United States relatively self-sufficient on electricity consumption. But our massive transportation sector consumes vast quantities of oil, and much of it comes from outside our borders. Imports have risen in the United States for the simple reason that with population growth our consumption has risen while our domestic production has dropped. For example, Alaska production is half what it was in the 1980s when the giant Prudhoe Bay field was at its peak.\n\n\nGiven available resources and existing technology, Romney's statement about becoming energy independent is little more than a pipe-dream, experts say.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's possible, just not likely,\" says David Rothkopf, president of\nWashington, D.C.-based consultancy Gartner Rothkopf LLC and a leading\nexpert on energy issues. \"It's not realistic. His heart is in the\nright place but I think he needs to look at the facts.\"\n(Rothkopf was a former deputy undersecretary of commerce for international trade policy in the Clinton administration.)\n\n\nRothkopf and others say that while the nation could conceivably achieve\nenergy independence in the long term, it's just not realistic in the\nnear term.\n\n\nFor the United States to achieve energy independence would take\nmassive investment in a range of options, from new conservation\ntechnology, next-generation biofuels, hydrogen fuel cells, plug-in\nhybrids, as well as aggressively seeking fossil fuel resources in the\nUnited States.\n\n\nMost of the newer technologies are not yet commercially viable, though they do hold\ngreat potential.\n\n\nThe real focus, experts say, needs to be on energy security, not\nindependence, i.e., ensuring that we get our energy from a sufficiently\ndiverse number of countries and different technologies, to reduce our\nvulnerability to political shocks and natural causes\nlike hurricanes and climate change. Experts call this \"energy\ninterdependence.\"\n\n\nT. Boone Pickens Jr., the Oklahoma oil tycoon, offered this\nsolution in an interview in September 2007 with the\n\nPittsburgh Tribune Review\n\n:\n\"You can't become energy independent. That's out of the question\nbecause you're importing 60 percent of the oil that you use every\nday. ...
