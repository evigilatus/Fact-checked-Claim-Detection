Nina Turner says 99 state workers lost jobs the day after Kasich unveiled his 'jobs budget'", "text": "Ohio law requires the state to keep its budget in balance. But it's up to the governor and the General Assembly to figure out how to do it and how the burdens of the balancing act should be shared.\n\nGov. John Kasich took the lead in that process with what he called the \"jobs budget,\" a spending blueprint that includes cuts to local governments and school districts and to state agencies to close an $800 billion budget shortfall.\n\nKasich unveiled his spending plan March 15, 2011.\n\nAt a public forum at the Idea Center at Playhouse Square, State Sen. Nina Turner said she feared the governor was \"balancing the budget on the backs of employees\" and would impair the government's ability to provide services.\n\nWhen \"the governor announced his 'jobs budget,' 99 folks from the Department of Taxation were let go the next day,\" she said.\n\nPolitiFact Ohio decided to check it out.\n\nOn March 16, the state said it will close seven regional Taxpayer Service Centers on June 30 -- the end of the fiscal year -- resulting in the loss of nearly 100 jobs.\n\nTax Commissioner Joe Testa sent e-mail notices to employees at regional Taxpayer Service Centers in Akron, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Dayton, Toledo, Youngstown and Zanesville. The Columbus center will remain open.\n\nWorkers in the Cleveland office told The Plain Dealer the closings are a mistake that will hurt taxpayers and hurt tax revenue.\n\nBut the tax department said the revenues are about half of the $7 million the state will save. Testa said the offices have only a fraction of the calls and walk-in traffic they once did.\n\nWe asked the governor's office about the job cuts.\n\n\"It's in the context of what we want to do with the budget as a whole,\" spokesman Rob Nichols said. \"We inherited an $8 billion budget hole. We had the seventh-highest taxes in the nation last year.\"\n\nThe closing of the service centers is in line with a promise the governor made during his campaign: to shrink state government and make it more efficient.\n\n\"This budget presents a spending blueprint that Ohio taxpayers can finally afford,\" Nichols said. \"We can't keep doing what we're doing and expect to succeed in this state.\"\n\nWhether closing the tax service centers and laying off workers is a good idea is a question for someone else to answer. But Kasich is doing it.\n\nThat rates Turner\u2019s statement as True on the Truth-O-Meter.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13115"}
