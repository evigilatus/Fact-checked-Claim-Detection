The first goal announced by the Society in New York in 1871 was \"to promote and encourage scientific shooting.\" Over the years, its focus has expanded, and eventually the group has become political. Information on pending firearms legislation was included in the American Journal of the Association, Venice; a Legislative Affairs Division was established in 1934. How does the National Republican Army accumulate against other pressure groups today? Well, in January 2019, the Wisconsin Democratic Campaign in Madison launched the n.R.A. title of the month's influence promoter. In an interview in January 3, 2019 on WRD 1510-AM, Matt Rothschild, Executive Director of the group, said \"Devil Defenders,\" a liberal radio talk show. He said, \"They spend a lot of money during the election.\" \"We just reported that they spent over a million dollars here in Wisconsin in the 2018 election. Most of that was for Walker or more specifically against Evers.\" The Democracy Campaign is a government monitoring group that tracks political contributions. Rothschild, of course, refers to the election in which the Democratic Tony Evers removed the Republican government. (Scott Walker) But what about many parts of his claim? Is he right? In looking at the claim when asked to support Rothschild &apos; s claim, the democracy campaign researcher Michael Boylo referred to expenditure reports from the Rwandan Patriotic Army &apos; s Political Victory Fund, which are available on the website of the Wisconsin Campaign &apos; s Financial Information System. For our purposes, we divide the claim into four parts: the National Rescue Authority is one of the largest lobbyists in Madison according to a report of the Wisconsin Ethics Committee entitled \"Total pressure expenditure classified in gross dollars,\" which spent $126,987 on lobbying during the period January 2017 to June 2018 (the latest data available on the Internet). This means that they classified 109 out of 793 groups. But that's far from \"one of the biggest.\" For example, the largest expenditure on lobbying was manufacturers and trade in Wisconsin, who spent more than $1 million in that period. This portion of the claim is therefore shortened. The National Republican Army is one of the largest spenders of the Wisconsin Rothschild election using the term \"ton of money.\" In our minds, this means that it is one of the largest spenders of the election according to the November 2018 news of the democracy campaign in Wisconsin itself. Here are the top 10 independent spending groups of the autumn election: Americans for Prosperity - $7.4 million from the right-wing directive and Wisconsin (RGA) - $6.5 million from the Administrative Committee on Coordination (ACC) and Wisconsin PAC - $4.3 million from the verification of the facts announced by Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden on the video \"Acceding to\" electoral fraud in \"Acknowing.\" By Bill McCarthy: January 12, 2021 Wisconsonsin Freedom PAC - $2.8 million - The Great Political Independent Expenditure Fund in Wisconsin - $2.3 million - People &apos; s Advocate &apos; s Project DAGA WI - $2.1 million - The Independent Election Expenditure Committee in Wisconsin State - US$ 1 million - US$ 955,155 for our future, so US$ 955,155 puts the National Rescue Authority at 1. 9. But it's far less than $2.3 million that would put it at the top of 5, or $7.4 million at the top. So this part of the claim is also slightly cancelled. More than $1 million in spending in 2018 Pol\u00edte Fact Wisconsin researched the Wisconsin 2018 Campaign Funding Information Site for the NRA Federal PAC Political Victory Fund and found the following: - spending on Evers: $872,915.46 - spending on Walker: $67,669.09 - spending on Michael Screenock (State High Court candidate): $44,159.98 - spending on Brad Shemel (Prosecutor General): $14,570.81 - spending on Andre Jakey (State Senate): $2,432.85, more than $1 million on elections in 2018, and therefore part of the claim strikes the target. Most of the expenditure was for Walker or against Evers the latter part of the claim also marked -- out of over $1 million gross, $940,584 was either for Walker, or the Evers fairs. Attempts to obtain comments from a spokesman for the Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA) were unsuccessful. Our assessment of Rothschild said that the National Republican Army is one of the biggest lobbyists here in D.C. They're spending a lot of money during the election. They spent over a million dollars here in Wisconsin in the 2018 election. Most of that was for Walker or more specifically against Evers.\" Our review of the numbers found a mixed bag. Rothschild's presentation on how the National Republican Army is piling up against other groups in Wisconsin, but he accurately described its spending in the recent elections. For a fairly accurate statement, our assessment is half correct.
