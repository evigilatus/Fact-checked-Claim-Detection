Terry McAuliffe is worried Washington is cutting the tracks.\nDuring his first address to the General Assembly in January, McAuliffe cited a list of natural attributes and state policies that have helped Virginia flourish. \"Much of the success I just described results from Virginia being the number one recipient of federal dollars,\" he said.\nMcAuliffe said federal defense cuts and a 16-day government shutdown last year \"dealt a severe blow to our economy and our confidence in the future.\" He said Virginia must diversify and become less dependent on U.S. largesse.\nWe wondered whether Virginia really is No. 1 on Uncle Sam\u2019s spending list.\nBrian Coy, a McAuliffe spokesman pointed us to figures from the Center for Effective Government, a liberal non-profit group that tracks U.S. spending. They show that in fiscal 2011, \u00a0companies located in Virginia had federal contracts totaling $88.7 billion -- tops in the nation. California companies were second with $62.4 billion in contracts followed by Texas, with $45.2 billion.\nData published by USA Spending.gov, a web site established by the Office of Management and Budget in the White House, shows Virginia has been tops in federal contract receipts during each of the last four fiscal years. A large reason is that Virginia -- home to world\u2019s largest Naval base in Norfolk and the nation\u2019s largest shipbuilder in Newport News -- receives more federal defense dollars than any other state, according to a 2011 analysis by Bloomberg Government.\nBut contracts are only part of federal spending. Washington sends states grants, direct payments for programs and pays salaries to federal employees scattered across the nation. To fully assess McAuliffe\u2019s claim that Virginia is \"the No. 1 recipient of federal dollars,\" we needed data that computed all of the federal dollars disbursed in Virginia.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Census Bureau used to tally the total amount of federal money flowing into each state in its Consolidated Federal Funds Report. Results from the final study showed that in fiscal \u00a02010, Virginia ranked sixth among states in receiving federal largesse. Here\u2019s a list of the leaders:\n\n\u00a0California, $333.8 billion\n\u00a0Texas, $225.7 billion\n\u00a0New York, $202.3 billion\n\u00a0Florida, $186.7 billion\n\u00a0Pennsylvania, $145.9 billion\n\u00a0Virginia, $136.1 billion.\n\nOur ruling\nMcAuliffe, in his maiden address to the General Assembly, said Virginia is \"the No. 1 recipient of federal dollars.\"\nThe governor\u2019s office backs the statement by citing statistics showing Virginia is tops in receiving federal contracts. But McAuliffe, in his speech, never defined his terms and federal dollars come to states in many ways, including salaries, grants and payments for Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare.\nWhen it\u2019s all put together, the most current data ranks Virginia sixth in receipt of federal funds and second when the largesse is broken down to an average per citizen.\nWe don\u2019t dispute McAuliffe\u2019s gist that Virginia\u2019s economy heavily relies on federal spending, but he illustrated his point with inartfully. Virginia leads the nation in receiving a few types of payments from Washington. Overall, Virginia is near the top of the list, but it\u2019s not No. 1.\nSo we rate McAuliffe\u2019s statement Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08318"}
