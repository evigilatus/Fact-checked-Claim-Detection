Terry McCulliff, in view of his candidacy for the presidency in 2020, commends his record as an inventor of a job. \"Every single city and province in Virginia, unemployment declined, and in most rural communities, it fell by more than 50 per cent,\" said Makulev, a democracy, from his tenure as Governor from 2014 to 2018. His comment was made during a 28 November radio interview at the John Frederick Show in Portsmouth. McCullough was a governor during a boom. The United States has shaken the Great Depression and made significant progress as it became an economic expansion for 113 months. Sil, we asked whether Makulev's statement was correct. The process of verifying our facts required two decisions: has unemployment declined in every province and city in Virginia during his tenure; has unemployment declined by more than half in most rural areas? Jake Robinstein, spokesman for the Virginia Democratic Party, said that Makulev had obtained his information from statistics maintained by the Virginia Employment Commission. The Committee obtains its data from the Office of Labour Statistics, which is our source of job numbers. The data show that the unemployment rate and the number of unemployed decreased in all 95 provinces of Virginia and 38 cities during the period of the state of Makulevi. The unemployment rate in Virginia was 5.7 per cent when Makulev took office in January 2014 and drowned to 3.3 per cent during his last full month as Governor in December 2017. During the same period, the unemployment rate in the United States fell from 7 per cent to 3.9 per cent. The unemployment rate was 14 between the states and the province of Colombia when Makulev took office. He was 16th in the nation when he left. The number of unemployed fell from about 240,000 to about 143,000 during the period of the state of Makolivi - a 40 per cent decrease. The number of unemployed persons in the United States fell from about 10.9 million to about 6.3 million during the same time - a 42 per cent decrease. On January 18, 2021 in the Committee &apos; s discussion. \"The United States is the only industrial country that has been modernized and does not already have a paid family medical leave programme.\" We used two measures to examine Makulev's natural claim that unemployment has fallen by 50 per cent in most rural communities. Rubenstein sent us a list of unemployment rates in all the cities and provinces of Virginia at the beginning and end of the state of Makulev. Only one rural town, Galax, experienced a drop in unemployment by more than half. \"Many of the other regions (rural judicial authorities) were close to 50%...\" Rubenstein wrote. Not quite. Only nine rural areas, including Galax, experienced a 40 per cent or more decline in their rates. Because Makulev never said in his statement that he specifically referred to the unemployment rate, we also checked whether the raw number of unemployed had fallen by more than 50 per cent in most rural areas. Once again, McCullough is short. Ten out of 50 cities and districts saw their unemployed population halved during the state of Makuliv. But many have approached under this measure. If Makulev had said that most rural communities had seen the number of unemployed residents fall by 45 per cent during his tenure, he would have been right. The last memorandum puts a warning on the verification of the facts about employment figures. Although presidents, governors and mayors like to take credit for large numbers, economists generally say that politicians have only a marginal impact on numbers. They say that the economy is retreating and flowing with global trends that politicians have little control over. While unemployment declined significantly during the years of Makulev, the average declines were almost equal to those of other states. Governor Makuliv said that during his tenure as Governor, \"each city and one province in Virginia, their unemployment declined, and in most rural communities, more than 50 per cent.\" He's right in the first part, and every area in Virginia is experiencing a decline in unemployment. Maculev's rule during the years of prosperity, each state experienced a sharp decline in unemployment. In the second part of his statement, most rural communities experienced a 50 per cent drop in unemployment, which comes a little short. If Makulev had said that most rural localities had seen a 45% decline in the number of unemployed, he would have been right. Recognizing that governors have little impact on the economy, we value Makulev's statement that it is often true.
