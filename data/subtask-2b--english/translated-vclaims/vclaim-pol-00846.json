There are many other places that refer to Stalin as the person who said it, but we have not been able to find any reliable original sources that explain attribution. So we contacted Stalin's digital archive, an electronic database of documents and images resulting from cooperation between the Russian State archives of social and political history and Yale University Press. The archive search did not find any identical quotations, since the archive support staff informed Polyte Fact in an e-mail. But because most of the contents of the archive are photos, the quote can be evasive. After that, we contacted some editorial board members in the archives in search of insight. Arch Getty, a history professor at the University of California, told us he didn't think Stalin said that. \"I'm not aware of any original source of this, and in my extensive search for archives in Stalin's personal archives, I found nothing like this,\" said Jetty. \"There are many apocryphal quotations wrongly attributed to Stalin, and I think this is one of them.\" James Harris, one of the leading lecturers in modern European history at Leeds University, agreed that the reference seemed questionable. \"Almost certainly Appleval,\" said Harris in an e-mail. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 On January 11, 2012, Ron Sony, Professor of Social and Political History at the University of Michigan, said that he had never seen or heard the quote before. \"Many things attributed to Stalin are wrong,\" he said. \"I'm not gonna fit this for him.\" But Mark Kramer, director of the Harvard University's Cold War Studies program, pointed us out something close. In her post-retirement notes, Boris Bazanov, former personal secretary of Stalin, claimed that Stalin said, \"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa It translates into: \"I consider it completely irrelevant who will vote in the party and how, but it's very important who will count the votes and how.\" Bazanov said Stalin was talking about voting procedures for the highest organs of the Communist Party, according to Kramer. \"There is no way to ascertain whether he accurately repeats Stalin's words, if Stalin actually said something like that,\" said Kramer. \"since then, this has been considered as a statement attributed to Stalin by his former secretary Boris Bazanov.\" David Brandenburger, Assistant Professor of History at Richmond University, said that Bazanov had fled the Soviet Union in 1928 and then published his unreliable memoirs in 1930. He said: \"Most experts are considered to quote Bazanov Stalin bucryphal.\" Another version of Stalin's so-called quote, as Brandenburger called it, is: \"In bourgeois countries, it's not important how they vote, but how they count.\" Some say Stalin was quoting Napoleon III, as Brandenburger said, but there is no real record of that. We're categorizing this article on Facebook as wrong.
