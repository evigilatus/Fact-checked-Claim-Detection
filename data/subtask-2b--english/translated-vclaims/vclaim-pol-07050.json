In the Tuesday elections, John Kitzhaber repeatedly claimed that the State was worse off now than it was when Kitzhaber was elected in 1994 for his first term. As Kitzhaber seeks what may be an unprecedented fourth period, Richardson, a Republican from the midpoint, urges voters to consider what he calls the many failures of the Democratic Party. Claim: During a television debate in front of the Portland City Club on 10 October 2014, Richardson stated that the Oregon economy had reached a long decline during the Katzhabar term, especially when it comes to wages. \"Women and men alike made less when they adapted to inflation than they were when it started,\" said Richardson. Are Oregon workers earning less today than they were in 1995? == sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man Analysis: We left phone and e-mail messages with Richardson's campaign in search of a source of claim, but we didn't hear it before the deadline. We received an e-mail from the campaign later and listed its response below. Then we texted Nick Belichex, an employment economist with the Oregon Employment Department. In a return e-mail, note that there is \"more than one source of this type of information and multiple acceptable ways of adjusting to inflation.\" Pelesis referred to the data collected by the United States Census Bureau and the Federal Office for Labour Statistics. These sources were used to compile a list of the average monthly income of working men and women in Oregon between 1995 and 2013. Among these are full-time and part-time workers covered by the Oregon Unemployment Insurance Programme. This includes all except federal employees, self-employed workers, some agricultural workers, some students and other jobs not covered by unemployment insurance. Since Richardson &apos; s claim was partly based on adjustment of wages for inflation, we also asked Belechek. Three methods were often used to achieve that - the consumer average price index for all cities for all (most commonly) consumers; the consumer price index for the Portland region, which was safe for all consumers; and the consumer price index for the Portland region, which was safe for wage-earners and clerical workers. On January 10, 2021, in an article on Facebook that says that Nancy Belusi sent a letter to the mayor of Portland after demonstrations there \"requiring him to stick to a proven democratic playbook.\" On January 11, 2021, both men and women working in 2013 - the latest year for which statistics are available - showed that they earned more money than their counterparts in 1995. In fact, women have seen greater gains than men. For example, in 1995, working women achieved an average of $2,328 per month using the most common method of adjusting to inflation. In 2013, women themselves achieved $2,853, an increase of $525 per month. The number of men using the same adjustment was $3,883 per month in 1995, compared to $4,207 in 2013. This is a monthly increase of $324. The other two methods resulted in similar increases. In a subsequent e-mail, the Richardson campaign provided data from the United States Census Bureau showing that the average household income in Oregon for 1995 was $36,374. The same table for 2013 shows that it amounts to $50,036. The campaign, using an automatic calculation machine for inflation, claimed that the latter figure should be 6 per cent higher to remain even for inflation. We looked for those numbers in Belesik. The figure of $36,374 was based on the current population survey using data for one year. He noted that the census published a non-modified estimate (in current dollars) and an inflation-adjusted estimate (using 2013 dollars). The inflation adjusted figures were 55,375 per cent for 1995 and $56,307 for 2013. \"The United States Census Bureau's inflation-adjusted estimate of average household income in Oregon increased by $1,100 from 1995 to 2013.\" In other words, that did not change the final outcome. Decision: In criticizing the Kitzhaber years as Governor, Richardson argued that men and women working in Oregon almost 20 years ago were more than they were now adjusting to inflation. Richardson's campaign came back to us, but regardless of the information you provided, it doesn't hold. Data from the federal agencies and the State Ministry of Labour show that both sexes today earn more when their wages are adjusted for inflation than they did when Kitzhaber was first elected in 1995. We're assessing the allegation wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07050"}
