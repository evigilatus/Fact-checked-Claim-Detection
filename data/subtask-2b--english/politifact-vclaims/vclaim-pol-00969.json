On Feb. 20, Democratic state Sen. Wiley Nickel took it a step further.\n\"SB5 pays for school construction with teacher pay raises,\" the Cary senator\u00a0tweeted, referring to the bill number.\nIn the same tweet, Nickel then walks back his claim, suggesting teacher pay isn\u2019t immediately affected: \"This plan puts into jeopardy funding for teacher pay raises, classroom supplies, broadband, roads and training for corrections officers.\"\nHis tweet then concludes with an image of the words, \"NC teachers shouldn\u2019t have to pay the price for school construction.\"\nPoliticians often try to extrapolate negative consequences from legislation they oppose \u2013 even if those consequences are unlikely or uncertain. Nickel\u2019s tweet is a prime example of a claim that should raise eyebrows. It suggests elected officials would take money away from teachers (who vote) and put it toward buildings (which don\u2019t vote).\nPolitiFact looked at the bill in question,\u00a0SB 5, to answer the question: Does it take money earmarked for teacher salaries and put it toward capital projects?\nNo. We found no evidence that the bill affects teacher salaries or potential raises.\nA SPECIAL FUND\nThe bill calls for using money from the State Capital Infrastructure Fund, a new fund created in 2017 that\u2019s expected to receive 4 percent of tax revenues this year.\n\"Senate Republicans propose increasing the contribution to the fund to 4.5 percent of tax revenue, and letting K-12 schools use some of the money for school construction,\"\u00a0The News & Observer reported.\nPolitiFact asked the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction whether the bill immediately affects teacher salaries.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have looked at the bill and the answer to your first question is no. The bill does not use money allocated for educator compensation,\" said Drew Elliot, communications director for NC DPI.\nPolitiFact also asked DPI if the bill could affect teacher salaries in the future. That\u2019s \"difficult to answer without knowing the larger context of a full budget bill,\" Elliot said.\nHYPOTHETICAL SCENARIOS\nContacted by PolitiFact, Nickel acknowledged that there\u2019s no mention of teacher salaries in the school construction proposal. He said it drains money from the state\u2019s general fund, leaving the state with less money for other projects.\nAs Nickel sees it, the Senate GOP plan leaves the state with one of three options in crafting a budget:\n\u2022 No teacher pay raises\n\u2022 Increase in sales taxes and fees to cover the difference\n\u2022 \"More budget cuts to departments that have already endured massive cuts to staff and services under their spending plan.\"\nNickel isn\u2019t the only one who says he\u2019s worried about the plan affecting future spending. Joe Coletti, senior fellow at the John Locke Foundation, a conservative think tank, told the\u00a0Carolina Journal\u00a0that the legislature may choose to use other funds if tax revenues ever decrease.\nHowever, those predictions and concerns are over hypotheticals. They don\u2019t reflect the immediate impact of the Senate\u2019s plan for funding school construction.\nPOLITIFACT RULING\nNickel said SB 5 \"pays for school construction with teacher pay raises.\" This is a rhetorical point that could be taken literally.\nIt\u2019s possible the bill would leave less money for teacher pay raises and other budget priorities. But the bill itself doesn\u2019t directly take money from teacher salaries or divert money away from them.
