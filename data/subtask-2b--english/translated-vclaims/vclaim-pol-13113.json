Scott Walker &apos; s drive for substantial cuts in education funding and compensation for State employees depends on his claim for a financial emergency followed mainly by excessive government spending. However, Democrats and liberal groups say that deviant fiscal policies for the rich and businesses at the expense of the middle class are major factors in the State budget deficit. Efforts to make this issue often focused on this phrase: \"two thirds of Wisconsin companies do not pay State income taxes.\" The Liberal Advocacy Group 1 Wisconsin now -- through its affiliated research arm, the Wisconsin Institute One -- was part of the effort to get this expression in front of the public. In April, the Institute's report, \"We're not broke,\" called that two-thirds \"wonderful,\" arguing that it was evidence that businesses here did not pay their fair share because of tax gaps, credit, and corporate tax rates in Wisconsin were below average. With Walker calling for the total elimination of corporate income tax, we thought it was time to get down to the bottom of this claim. When asked to support the claim by Scott Ross, Executive Director of the Wisconsin Groups, he referred to a 2011 revenue management report and a corporate tax analysis conducted by the non-partisan legislative tax office. Both use data for 2007, which government officials say are the most recent and best available data in early 2011. A quick word about numbers: the universe we're dealing with is the income taxes of companies paid by regular category C companies at 7.9% of companies -- one of the largest sources of government tax revenue. The study of revenue management deliberately excludes \"S\" companies and limited liability companies that pass through income to multiple owners or partners. They are taxed at lower rates under the personal income tax system, not within the corporate framework. Both agencies report this: out of 52,497 corporate returns, 17,564 were tax returns totalling approximately $703 million. According to our calculations, this is 66.5 per cent of companies that have no responsibility -- two thirds of the claim. We wondered if this was a one-year rise. It's not. :: Revenue management officials have prepared a special report for us. It showed the same figure by 66 per cent with a slight variation in 2004 &apos; 05, &apos;06 and &apos;07. In 2008 -- the share of companies that did not have any tax liability jumped to 69 per cent that year. \u2219 (data for 2008 were not available when the report was prepared by the Wisconsin I Institute). In fact, two thirds reflect things at the federal level. According to the Government Accountability Office, at least 60 per cent of all United States companies - including many small companies - did not report any federal income tax obligations from 1998 to 2005, according to an article in the Wall Street Journal from 2008. How can at least two out of three companies not pay taxes? Part of the answer lies in the same income management schedule. Very soon, two thirds of the 52,497 companies that filed in Wisconsin reported zero net income or loss in 2007 - leaving them without any tax liability. \"Only because some companies are large and profitable, it does not follow all companies large and profitable,\" said John Coskinen, Chief Economist of the State Revenue Department. \"Most companies are too small with little or no profit.\" The head of the Payers Alliance in Wisconsin, a research organization, said: \"It's worth declaring what's clear -- if the company doesn't make money after expenses, it won't pay taxes,\" said Todd Perry. \"The decrease is such an expenditure (discount) -- which is generally accepted.\" In addition, some companies were inactive in a given year, noting Stephanie Marquez, spokesman for the State Department of Revenue. Also, a large number of individuals - as opposed to companies - bear no tax liability. About 31 per cent of them did not owe income taxes, according to income management figures for 2009. However, this reduces the number of people who were not tax-indebted, perhaps by a large amount, because low-income families do not have to register, according to our census data calculations. We asked Ross, among those who mentioned the number, why he called it a \"shock\" that companies with no net income would not pay taxes. Ross referred to several tax exemptions and reductions. When used, they can take a profitable company and reduce its threshold to zero for tax purposes. The State Revenue Report confirms these phenomena: a small number of companies had a net income but had not yet owed any taxes on the State &apos; s income. In total, 390 profitable companies have not paid a government income tax demanding sufficient tax exemptions that have reduced their tax obligations to zero, as indicated by the Revenue Department. This means that tax exemptions allowed 2% of net-income companies to avoid taxes. But this is just part of the number of companies that have received tax preferences to reduce corporate income taxes. In addition to twelve or more tax exemptions for companies, more than 20 other interruptions in the form of deductions, exceptions and special treatment are recorded in State records, and a case report is provided. The total tax exemption for all preferences was more than $254 million in 2008, according to the Revenue Management Report. It is clear, therefore, that tax exemptions can have a significant impact on corporate tax collection, which in Wisconsin is either in the middle of the group or lower at the national level, an investigation into Centinel magazine found in 2010. Proponents of business tax exemptions say it is important to provide incentives to expand and improve business. Critics say that their pro-business influence is unclear. Despite disagreement over the whole issue, there is no comprehensive study to determine why companies do not report their net income. According to State officials, this will require an individual review of tens of thousands of tax returns. Finally, it should be noted that two developments limit the usefulness of State data in drawing conclusions on the business tax climate. No. 1: It is now common for start-ups to form partnerships rather than \"C\" companies. So part of the picture is missing, because the state does not withdraw the tax payment data on these companies, many of which are small. Officials of State revenue continue to say that their data on C companies are worth it, given the large dollar at stake. No. A relatively new change called \"joint reporting\" may increase the collection of tax revenues from companies in the coming years. However, no data are yet available. What is the point? The Liberal Institute of One Wisconsin used State data to confirm that two thirds of Wisconsin companies did not pay State income taxes. The number of two thirds is constant, and the long-term trend is also reflected in federal tax data. For some companies, tax cuts reduce the floor to zero in tax obligations. However, the Group did not note that a share of those non-paymentable businesses was not sufficient to pay taxes. We can't say how important these details are because the data don't exist. On the O-Meter truth that is often appreciated as true.
