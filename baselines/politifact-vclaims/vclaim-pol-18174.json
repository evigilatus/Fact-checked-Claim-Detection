That\u2019s because you can contract the virus by touching surfaces that have the respiratory droplets of an infected person on them.\nBut how long can coronavirus germs live on those surfaces? An infographic from KIRO-TV in Seattle offers some clarity.\nAccording to the graphic, which was published March 18 on Facebook, the coronavirus can live for \"up to 3 hours in the air, up to 4 hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard up to 3 days on plastic and stainless steel.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

But in this case, the latest research backs it up \u2014 so keep washing your hands and disinfecting your home.\n\nThe graphic cites an article published in the New England Journal of Medicine on March 17. Researchers tested how long the coronavirus, formally called SARS-CoV-2, lived on five different surfaces: aerosols, plastic, stainless steel, copper and cardboard.\n\"SARS-CoV-2 remained viable in aerosols throughout the duration of our experiment (3 hours),\" the authors wrote. \"SARS-CoV-2 was more stable on plastic and stainless steel than on copper and cardboard.\"\nAside from air, the worst surface for the virus\u00a0is copper; researchers could only detect viable virus particles there for up to four hours. On cardboard, they could not detect any after 24 hours. The coronavirus lives the longest on plastic and stainless steel \u2014\u00a0up to three days.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 25, 2021 in a blog post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWHO now saying you do not need to wear a mask.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the article is not a peer-reviewed study, and researchers tested the lifespan of SARS-CoV-2 in a lab setting.

While it did not include #COVID_19, it may provide a better idea of how long this pathogen can survive outside of the body. \u2060 \u2060 The authors concluded that if this new coronavirus resembles other human coronaviruses, such as its \"cousins\" that cause #SARS and #MERS, it can stay on surfaces \u2014 such as metal, glass or plastic \u2014 for as long as nine days. \u2060 \u2060 This is in comparison to flu viruses which can last on surfaces for only about 48 hours.\u2060 \u2060 But there are some important caveats to consider. Some #coronavirus don't remain active for as long at temperatures higher than 86 degrees Fahrenheit (30 degrees Celsius). \u2060 \u2060 The authors also found that coronaviruses can be effectively wiped away by common household disinfectants. \u2060 \u2060 For now that is the best information we have.\u2060 \u2060 To follow the continually updated coronavirus dashboard, tap the link in our bio and bookmark the page.\u2060 \u2060 \u2060 \u2060 \u2060 A post shared by  Medscape (@medscape) on Mar 17, 2020 at 2:29am PDT \nAn article published in the Journal of Hospital Infection in March reviewed what other scientists have found about how long human coronaviruses can survive on different surfaces. The authors found that viruses like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which are both similar to COVID-19, could live for a couple of days on steel, plastic, wood, paper and glass surfaces.\nWhat about money, which many Americans handle every day? The World Health Organization advises people to wash their hands with soap and water after handling banknotes, coins and credit cards.\nThe Journal of Hospital Infection article says human coronaviruses could live on paper for anywhere between one to five days. The U.S. Dollar is made up of 75% cotton and 25% linen, as opposed to wood pulp, which is the base for most paper.\nStill, you\u2019re probably safer handling coins. The New England Journal of Medicine article found that COVID-19 can only survive for up to four hours on copper, which is what quarters, nickels and dimes are primarily made of. Ironically, pennies are made primarily of zinc, although they have a copper exterior.\nBased on the information available, KIRO-TV\u2019s infographic is accurate. But we\u2019ll issue a small note of caution because the study has not been peer-reviewed. Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18174"}
