The debt was too staggering. By 2004, 365 stores had closed.\"\n\nThat the chain failed isn't in dispute: KB Toys dissolved in bankruptcy court under different owners in 2008. We\u2019re checking the video\u2019s overall portrayal of the Bain-KB relationship in another item.\n\nHere, we\u2019ll check one specific claim made in the video:\n\n\"Mitt Romney and Bain saw a 900 percent return on their investment\" in KB Toys, the video says. \"Romney and Bain\u2019s profits at the expense of 15,000 jobs was described by the Boston Herald as \u2018disgusting.\u2019\"\n\nIn addition, the on-screen visual emphasizes the point, showing the text, \"\u2018disgusting profits,\u2019 Boston Herald, 11/17/2009.\"\n\nThat suggests the comment came from a Herald editorial or columnist. So we looked back at the article the video referenced -- a news story headlined, \"KB Toys worker blasts Bain for execs' payout.\"\n\nThe story is about the campaign of Stephen Pagliuca for the Democratic nomination to fill the U.S. Senate seat made vacant upon the death of Edward Kennedy. Pagliuca is managing director of Bain Capital as well as co-owner of the Boston Celtics. The story quotes a former KB Toys employee attacking Bain for its role in KB Toys\u2019 demise, which the story says resulted in 450 job losses in the Boston area.\n\nHere\u2019s an excerpt:\n\n\"\u2018They were supposed to be coming in to create jobs and help the company grow when they took us over. What happened?'\u2019 asked Mark W. Dean, a 45-year-old Pittsfield resident who has been out of a job since KB Toys went out of business earlier this year. \"It's just another political promise.'\n\n\"Pagliuca spokesman Will Keyser said the Celtics co-owner wasn't directly involved in managing the KB Toys takeover, although he did profit from the deal.\n\n\"\u2018He has acknowledged over the course of the campaign that businesses he or his company invested in have failed, but the record of successes he's been involved in far outnumber the failures,\u2019'' said Keyser in a statement. ...\n\n\"Dean, who worked at KB Toys for 22 years, is still outraged by the $121 million payout to execs and investors.\n\n\"\u2018That was disgusting. There were a lot of employees who were upset about that,\u2019' Dean said.\"\n\nSo what we have is a Boston Herald news story quoting an angry former employee -- not an impartial newspaper expressing outrage in its own voice, which is what the voice-over suggests. Nowhere does the ad note that the sentiments were actually expressed by a worker laid off by the company.\n\nOur ruling\n\nThe story referenced by the video does contain the \"disgusting\" quote. But in both in the voice-over and the video, the \"King of Bain\" video suggests that the comment was spoken in the editorial voice of the Boston Herald. It wasn't -- it came from a laidoff worker. We rate the statement Mostly False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H.
