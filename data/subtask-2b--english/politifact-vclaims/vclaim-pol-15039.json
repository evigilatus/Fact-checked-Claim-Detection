The release included an open letter to Cannon and Haridopolos:\nFor the past year, you've relentlessly championed efforts to allow oil rigs as close as three miles from our coast. The human, environmental and economic catastrophe happening now in our Gulf shows the folly of that effort. Although you've expressed new concerns in light of this tragedy, neither of you have publicly abandoned your effort to pass legislation next year that would sell off Florida's coastal waters to British Petroleum, Exxon, Chevron and other oil companies.It's been reported in the media that you want to further study what happened in the Deepwater Horizon accident, as if there is a possible cause that would make drilling in Florida's state waters still Okay? As many experts told you before this massive spill, it's not a matter of \"if\" there will be an oil spill catastrophe, but \"when.\" As concerned Floridians, we demand to know, \"YES\" or \"NO\", do you still plan to allow oil drilling off Florida's coast?\nFor this item, we decided to check Progress Florida's claim that Cannon and Haridopolos have said they plan to push drilling legislation when they come to power in the 2011 legislative session. So let's explore where the two incoming leaders stand on drilling.Cannon, R-Winter ParkIn 2009, Cannon filed a bill in the Florida House that would have permitted the state to lease drilling areas (at $1 million per application) that are 3 to 10 miles off Florida's coast. The bill passed the House but failed in the Senate.He brought the bill back in 2010 with provisions that would give the military veto power over drilling leases (it uses the Gulf of Mexico for training exercises) and would prevent, Cannon said, visual impact to Florida's beaches. But without support in the Senate, the bill again died.Before the spill, Cannon said he intended to try a third time in 2011, when he is speaker.On April 17, Cannon stopped the drilling discussion for the year, but said the bill would return. \"What we will do today is leave this issue in the best posture it can be -- in a position that reflects our collective work and our collective concerns,\" Cannon said. \"So when the time is right -- hopefully that is next year -- we take that issue up and deliberate further.\"\u00a0After the spill, however, Cannon called for a timeout.\"Until we have all of the facts and all the answers about what happened and why, we shouldn't move forward,\" Cannon said on April 27.And on May 2: \"'I think it definitely is a game changer.\"Haridopolos, R-Merrit IslandHaridopolos, the incoming Senate president, also has been a proponent of oil drilling in state waters. \"We will enhance Florida\u2019s economic sovereignty by considering legislation that would allow the state\u2019s Cabinet officials to open the waters off of Florida\u2019s west coast to oil and natural gas production,\" Haridopolos wrote in an editorial published Sept. 24, 2009. \"Florida can no longer afford to sit idly by as competing Gulf Coast states, and even foreign nations, reap the Gulf\u2019s economic benefits. We can\u2019t count on Washington to understand our energy needs, and Floridians need to take steps to reclaim our economic independence.\"Haridopolos published a pre-session constituent survey that he said found that 76.7 percent support legislation to allow offshore oil drilling on the Gulf Coast of Florida. The poll was unscientific.Haridopolos also filed legislation in the Senate in 2010 that would have allowed drilling in state waters. The only reason it didn\u2019t move, the St. Petersburg Times/Miami Herald reported, was because of opposition from President Jeff Atwater. Like Cannon, Haridopolos has made offshore drilling a priority for Florida's 2011 session, hoping money from oil leases could bring new sources of revenue to Florida.That may not change, even in the wake of the spill.\"Anytime you look at any exploration, whether it's energy or space, there are inherent risks,\" Haridopolos said in Florida Today on April 28. \"We just saw 29 miners killed in West Virginia, getting coal.\"Next year, we want to know what happened in Louisiana -- was it sabotage, human error, how could it be prevented,\" Haridopolos said. \"This is a big change in policy and something like this gives us pause.\"On the same day in the Sarasota Herald-Tribune Haridopolos said: \"One incident should not put the idea to death.\"The ruling\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden canceled the Keystone pipeline because Warren Buffett \u201cdonated $58 million\u201d to his campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlorida Progress claims that both have said they plan to bring up oil drilling during the 2011 session, allowing drilling perhaps as close as 3 miles from Florida's shore. They have. We rate Progress Florida's claim True.\nUPDATE: On May 4, after this item was published, Cannon told the Orlando Sentinel that opening Florida waters to offshore drilling has been \"permanently tabled\" due to concerns over the gulf oil spill. Cannon said he will not push drilling during his two years as Speaker. \u201cAn accident like this hasn\u2019t happened in my adult lifetime,\u201d he said. \u201cI doubt we\u2019re going to get adequate answers [as to the cause] in two years, and as a matter of term limits, I\u2019m done in two years. So as far as I\u2019m concerned, it\u2019s off the table.\u201d", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-15039"}
