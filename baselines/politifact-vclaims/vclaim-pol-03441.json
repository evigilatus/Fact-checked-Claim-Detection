Trump contradicts himself on whether he knew Steve Bannon", "text": "President Donald Trump wavered in his support for White House aide and strategist Steve Bannon in an interview with The New York Post on Tuesday, following stories of a rift forming between Bannon and Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.\n\"I like Steve, but you have to remember he was not involved in my campaign until very late,\" Trump said. \"I had already beaten all the senators and all the governors, and I didn\u2019t know Steve. I\u2019m my own strategist, and it wasn\u2019t like I was going to change strategies because I was facing crooked Hillary.\n\"Steve is a good guy, but I told them to straighten it out or I will,\" Trump said.\nTrump \"didn\u2019t know Steve\"?\nThat\u2019s an altogether different story than Trump told when he first hired Bannon, a former top editor at the conservative website Breitbart, onto his campaign staff last fall. It also directly contradicts the public record.\nTrump announced the hiring of Bannon and adviser Kellyanne Conway as part of the Trump campaign on Aug. 17, 2016. Here\u2019s what he said at that time:\n\"I have known Steve and Kellyanne both for many years. They are extremely capable, highly qualified people who love to win and know how to win,\" Trump said. \"I believe we\u2019re adding some of the best talents in politics, with the experience and expertise needed to defeat Hillary Clinton in November and continue to share my message and vision to Make America Great Again. I am committed to doing whatever it takes to win this election, and ultimately become President because our country cannot afford four more years of the failed Obama-Clinton policies which have endangered our financial and physical security.\"\nSo, in Trump\u2019s own words he either \"didn\u2019t know Steve,\" or he has \"known Steve \u2026 for many years.\"\nOne of those claims is clearly wrong.\nRebecca Berg of RealClearPolitics provides the answer. She reported the day after Bannon\u2019s hiring by the campaign that Bannon first met Trump in 2011, when Trump was considering whether to challenge President Barack Obama in 2012. In later years, Bannon hosted a radio program in which Trump was a frequent guest, Berg reported.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As Breitbart grew, Mr. Trump was constantly in touch with Steve about news articles and doing interviews with his reporters,\" David Bossie, president of the conservative advocacy nonprofit Citizens United, told RealClearPolitics.\nThe Washington Post\u00a0counted nine times that Trump appeared as a guest on Bannon's radio show.\nThat version of events is corroborated by The New Yorker. \"In 2011, David Bossie, the head of the conservative group Citizens United, introduced Trump to Bannon; at the time, Trump was thinking about running against Obama.
