Al Sharpton. Holder\u2019s prepared speech spotlighted what his department had done in areas that would loom large for his predominantly African-American audience. He talked about voting rights, prosecuting hate crimes and ensuring better legal counsel for defendants unable to afford a lawyer.\nBut at one moment, Holder strayed from the script. A line that was supposed to lead into the Supreme Court\u2019s rejection of a key voting rights tool turned into a rebuke of the Republican Congress.\n\"The last five years have been defined by significant strides and by lasting reforms even in the face, even in the face of unprecedented, unwarranted, ugly and divisive adversity,\" Holder said. \"If you don\u2019t believe that, you look at the way \u2014 forget about me, forget about me. You look at the way the attorney general of the United States was treated yesterday by a House committee \u2014 has nothing to do with me, forget that. What attorney general has ever had to deal with that kind of treatment? What president has ever had to deal with that kind of treatment?\"\nWhile Holder never mentioned race, the punditocracy concluded that Holder was saying that he and President Barack Obama are subject to greater disrespect because they are black. On Fox News Sunday, Brit Hume said he suspected that Holder was invoking race, and unfairly so.\n\"This strikes me as kind of cry baby stuff from Holder,\" Hume said. \"My sense of that this is that both Eric Holder and Barack Obama have benefited politically enormously from the fact that they are African-American and the first to hold the jobs that they hold.\"\nHume and his fellow panelist George Will said other presidents and attorneys general have suffered worse treatment on Capitol Hill.\nThose comments drew further response the next day on MSNBC\u2019s The Ed Show. Host Ed Schultz asked Georgetown professor Michael Eric Dyson what he thought of the cry baby label.\nDyson, himself African-American, rejected it and took his own dig at the Fox News panel, which was made up of three white men and one white woman.\n\"We know that Sunday mornings have usually been given over to conservative white men who carp and complain to no end about the inability to get access (to power) when they have it,\" Dyson said.\nWe can\u2019t fact-check the carping and complaining line, but we can drill down on Dyson\u2019s claim that \"Sunday mornings have usually been given over to conservative white men.\"\nSince the start of the year, PunditFact has been tracking guests who have appeared on the five most prominent Sunday news shows -- Fox News Sunday, Face the Nation, Meet the Press, This Week and State of the Union. So far we\u2019ve logged 600 different guests, and categorized them by job, political leaning, race and gender. On politics, we created three categories -- conservative, liberal and \"other\" (a catch-all category). We, if we might say, took a conservative approach and when we had any doubts, used the \"other\" category liberally. Our tally does not include hosts or interviewers but does include all panelists. So when Jonathan Karl fills in as host on This Week, he would not count. But when Karl appears on ABC's weekly rountable, he would.\nEventually we plan on building a guest tracker that will allow you to see who appears most often on the Sunday news shows.\nBut for now we can use the data we have collected to analyze Dyson\u2019s claim.\nWhat we found\nAgain, Dyson is claiming that the typical Sunday morning show crowd consists of \"conservative white men.\"\nHe\u2019s certainly right that most guests are white men. They account for two-thirds of all the people invited to the Sunday talk fests.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMen, regardless of ethnic background or job, make up 75 percent of all guests. Whites, both male and female, make up 85 percent of all guests.\nBut Dyson steers off course by adding the qualifier \"conservative,\" our data shows.\nConservatives -- regardless of gender or race -- make up about 32 percent of the guests while liberals make up 26 percent. The remaining guests, about 42 percent, are neither conservative nor liberal -- a broad group that includes journalists and technical experts. (Think Judy Woodruff and lots of people talking about the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370.)\nThe number of conservatives shrink when isolate on \"conservative white men.\" The group of white conservative men claims about 25 percent of all appearances on the Sunday talk shows in 2014. Clearly, that\u2019s not a majority. It's not even a plurality.\nThe most likely group to appear on the Sunday shows is other or neutral white males. They make up 27 percent of all guests so far in 2014.\nWe also decided to look just at pundits. Of that group, the percentage of conservative white male pundits is actually smaller, our database shows.\nSince the start of the year, 410 pundits have appeared on the Sunday shows. Of that group, about 20 percent were \"conservative white men.\" That\u2019s more than liberal white men, who made up 8 percent of pundits. But not nearly as much as neutral white male pundits -- who made up about 35 percent of all appearances.\nWe reached out to Dyson to get his numbers and we haven\u2019t heard back.\nWhat we can say is from our database of the Sunday talk shows is that conservatives are outnumbering liberals, but conservative white males don\u2019t hold dominion. It\u2019s people who don\u2019t fall into any particular political category that represent the largest single group.\nNow, we're not the only group that tracks the Sunday show guests list.\nThe liberal group Media Matters released findings from a review of the 2013 network Sunday shows (our list, except for CNN's State of the Union). According to their methodology, conservative white males made up 29 percent of all guests in 2013, more than the next biggest group, neutral white males, who accounted for 23 percent of all guests.\nConservative white males made up the largest percentage for\u00a0any one group, Media Matters said, but still accounted for just three in 10 guests.\nOur ruling\nDyson said the the Sunday talk shows are usually given over to conservative white men. It would have been much more accurate if he just said white men.\nAccording to the liberal group Media Matters, conservative white males made up 29 percent of the guests when looking at four Sunday shows. That's the largest of any group when breaking things down for ideology, race and gender, Media Matters found.\nOur database for 2014 presents different findings. So far, 25 percent of all appearances on the Sunday talk shows in 2014 have been made by conservative white men. That's slightly less than neutral or \"other\" white men who made up 27 percent of all guest appearances so far in 2014.\nDyson described the Sunday shows as having been \"given over\" to conservative white males. While that phrase isn't exact, it does suggest a dominant presence. The numbers don\u2019t back that up. Conservatives outman the liberals but by the time you drill down to white, male, conservatives, they lose much of the edge.\nDyson pushed too far on his adjectives.
