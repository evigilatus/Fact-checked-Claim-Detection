Scott Walker, who is seeking a third term. But on Dec. 1, 2017, six days before her Facebook announcement, Roys used social media in a different way to criticize tax reform efforts by President Donald Trump and other Republicans.\nShe posted this tweet:\nNever let the GOP tell you again that they support low taxes. They don\u2019t\u2014unless you\u2019re already a billionaire or a massive corporation. #TaxBill\n(Attached was the graphic shown above.)\nMany have criticized the proposed GOP tax cuts as favoring the richest.\nBut 99.8 percent of Americans wouldn\u2019t get any tax cut?\nThat\u2019s not correct. Not close.\nThe estate tax\nRoys told us she was referring to an April 2017 Facebook post by U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin LeMahieu\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a TV interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It takes quite a while on Election Day to load those ballots, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat post blasted Trump\u2019s proposal to repeal the estate tax, and it included the figures about the Waltons, the Koch brothers and Trump\u2019s family that were part of Roys\u2019 tweet. Sanders\u2019 post also said \"99.8 percent of Americans would not benefit by one nickel under Trump\u2019s plan to repeal the estate tax.\"\nSo, Sanders was clearly referring to only one tax reform provision: repeal of the estate tax.\nWe\u2019ve rated True a claim by U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wis., that what some call the \"death tax\" was paid by only \"two out of every 1,000 people\" in 2016. That\u2019s the equivalent of 99.8 percent. The tax applies only if an estate\u2019s value exceeds $5.45 million, or $10.9 million, if there is a surviving spouse, and is paid by only about 5,000 estates per year.\nBut Roys\u2019 tweet was making a general reference to Trump\u2019s tax plan -- with no indication that the numbers referred only to the estate tax.\nAnd its bottom-line claim was that \"under Trump\u2019s new tax plan \u2026 99.8% of Americans\" get \"not one nickel\" in tax cuts.\nRoys told us she now realizes that what she posted did not make it clear she was referring only to the estate tax. Indeed, a reader could only assume her claim was about the tax plan generally, with the \"#TaxBill\" reference she used and the \"Trump\u2019s new tax plan\" in the headline.\nAs for the House and Senate tax reform plans now in play, with Republicans hoping to finalize a plan for Trump\u2019s signature before the end of 2017, several tax-cut provisions benefit the rich specifically.\nBut the tax cuts would be widespread: Both plans would lower individual income tax rates for the middle class, and most people in lower-income households would see cuts, as well.\nOur rating\nRoys said that \"under Trump\u2019s new tax plan \u2026 99.8% of Americans\" get \"not one nickel\" in tax cuts.\nRoys said she was referring to the Republican proposal to repeal the federal estate tax, which would only benefit the wealthiest and does not apply to 99.8 percent of Americans.\nBut her tweet made no reference to the estate tax. It gave the impression she was referring to Trump\u2019s overall tax plan. That plan has its critics, including those who believe it gives too much to the rich. Nevertheless, as has been widely reported, the plan offers widespread tax cuts.\nWe rate Roys\u2019 statement Pants on Fire.\n\u00a0  Share the Facts 2017-12-13 17:42:11 UTC   PolitiFact    1 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Pants on Fire  \"Under Trump\u2019s new tax plan \u2026 99.8% of Americans\" get \"not one nickel\" in tax cuts.
