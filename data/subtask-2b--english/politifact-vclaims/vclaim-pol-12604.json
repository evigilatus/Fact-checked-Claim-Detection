That's the contention being made by George LeMieux, as the two Republicans vie for the GOP nomination to take on incumbent Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson.\n\nLeMieux, a former U.S. senator, is challenging Hasner, a former Florida House majority leader, on two core issues: taxes and spending.\n\nLeMieux campaign e-mails and Web posts on Aug. 1, 2011,\u00a0show a cartoon Hasner wearing a joker hat and holding a mask in his hand. He is attending his own \"masquerade ball\" \u2014 one where he\u2019s only pretending to be conservative.\n\n\"The Masquerade Ball gown Hasner has chosen on the key issues of taxes and spending is a prime example. Hasner\u2019s rhetoric simply does not match his record. Hasner\u2019s record includes:\n\n\u2022 Increasing Spending \u2013 A 40% increase during his time in the legislature.\n\u2022 Requesting over $92.2 million in earmarks.\n\u2022 Billions in new taxes and fees.\n\u2022 Voting to accept Obama stimulus money.\"\n\nThe earmark claim caught our eye. Hasner, elected to the Florida House of Representatives in 2002,\u00a0served as majority leader\u00a0from 2008-10 before term limits ended his run. That means plenty of time to rack up requests for pet projects. But did he request \"over $92.2 million in earmarks\"? And if he did, how did that compare with requests by other lawmakers?\n\nA more detailed look at Hasner\u2019s record at\u00a0GeorgeForFlorida.com\u00a0clarifies the LeMieux campaign was talking about Florida\u2019s twist on the earmark, the \"Community Budget Issue Request.\" As we\u2019ve written in\u00a0other \"earmark\" fact-checks, it\u2019s a way state legislators use to request funding for local projects. Lawmakers had to file requests \u2014 for a local park, say, or a new community wastewater system \u2014 and attach their names to each one.\u00a0\n\nThe Legislature\u00a0stopped the practice\u00a0in 2009 as budgets got tighter. But the Florida House keeps\u00a0an archive of such requests, funded and unfunded, at FloridaHouse.gov.\n\nA PolitiFact Florida analysis of\u00a0lawmakers\u2019 requests from 2003-08\u00a0shows Hasner indeed made use of CBIRs to ask for state funding for everything from a\u00a0community child care center in Delray Beach\u00a0($25,000) to support for a\u00a0medical cluster and research institute in the Miami\u00a0area ($20 million). He requested $1 million for \"manatee avoidance technology,\" made regular requests on behalf of\u00a0brain injury prevention efforts\u00a0among seniors ($199,450) and asked for taxpayer aid for drainage improvements, boardwalk replacements and reclaimed water systems.\n\nOver six years, his requests total just over $92.2 million.\n\nWe\u2019ll mention that the archive doesn\u2019t make it clear which projects ultimately won funding, and indeed some requests may have been made year after year precisely because they failed to attract lawmaker support.\n\nWe wondered how Hasner\u2019s requests ranked among the 120 House members. When we listed lawmakers from most to least requested per year, here's where Hasner fell:\n\n\u00a0\n\nRep. Adam Hasner\u2019s Community Budget Issue Requests 2003-08\n\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\n\nAmount requested\n\nRank among lawmakers\n\n\n\n2003\n\n$8.2 million\n\n64th\n\n\n\n2004\n\n$1.6 million\n\n95th\n\n\n\n2005\n\n$5.9 million\n\n76th\n\n\n\n2006\n\n$20.9 million\n\n48th\n\n\n\n2007\n\n$55.4 million\n\n17th\n\n\n\n2008\n\n$385,000\n\n109th\n\n\n\n\n\nThat means the amount of local funding Hasner requested for his district was in the bottom half of lawmakers in four out of six years, though it jumped to the 60th percentile in 2006, the year before he served as deputy majority leader, and the 86th percentile in 2007, the year before he took the top seat.\n\nBut even in 2007, the amount Hasner requested was eclipsed by top CBIR filers, such as\u00a0Rep. Marti Coley, R-Marianna,\u00a0who wanted $202.3 million for projects in her district \u2014 nearly four times Hasner\u2019s total.\n\nA couple of other notes.\u00a0\n\nFirst, we feel we should at least mention that LeMieux has a record of voting for earmarks while he was in the U.S. Senate. LeMieux, who\u00a0hadn\u2019t held elected office\u00a0before he was appointed to U.S. Sen. Mel Martinez\u2019s seat in 2009 by his former boss, Gov. Charlie Crist, has claimed he\u00a0never requested a single earmark. But he didn\u2019t have to: Earmarks bound for Florida were already packed into appropriations bills before LeMieux took over for Martinez.\u00a0LeMieux voted for several such bills. He also actively\u00a0lobbied for local stimulus projects. Later, he voted for a moratorium to ban federal earmarks through 2013 \u2014 but so did Sen. Bill Nelson.\n\nMeanwhile, as the Florida economy faltered, Hasner cut his own local funding requests in 2008 to a single item \u2014 $385,000. That put him last among more than 100 lawmakers who made local funding requests. And he was in the leadership when the decision was made to stop such requests altogether. Hasner\u2019s campaign, for the record, thinks it\u2019s unfair to call Community Budget Issue Requests \"earmarks,\" which campaign spokesman Douglass Mayer said evokes last-minute congressional handshake deals.\n\n\"The difference here is transparency,\" Mayer said. \"CBIRs are submitted with full accountability and voted on in the light of day. Earmarks are snuck in the backdoor of the federal budget process to avoid accountability.\"\n\nBut CBIRs are often referred to as Florida\u2019s version of the earmark, and documentation from the LeMieux campaign makes the reference clear.\u00a0\n\nWhere does this leave us?\n\nLeMieux\u2019s campaign says that \"(Adam) Hasner\u2019s record includes \u2026 requesting over $92.2 million in earmarks.\" On the numbers, LeMieux is right -- from 2003-08 Hasner requested $92.2 million for projects through a process called Community Budget Issue Requests. But we think there are a couple of caveats worth noting.\n\nFirst is the CBIR process itself -- which was open and transparent. Legislators made requests for dollars in writing and were forced to explain what the money would be used for. Second, it's important to note that Hasner wasn't particularly aggressive in requesting money through CBIRs and more than 100 House members asked for more than he did in 2008. Lastly, it strikes us as hypocritical for LeMieux to attack competitors over earmarks when his own record \u2014 where it exists \u2014 shows votes and personal lobbying for local spending.\u00a0\n\nWe rate this claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-12604"}
