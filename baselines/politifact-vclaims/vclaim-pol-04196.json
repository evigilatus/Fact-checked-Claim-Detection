Dana Young, R-Tampa, has sent mailers touting her vote for a recent bill targeting fracking.\nThe effects of the legislation Young voted for are not as clear cut as the claim Young makes.\nA third-party group supporting Young, who is facing Democrat Bob Buesing for state Senate in the newly created District 18, sent the\u00a0mailer in the last weeks of September that says she \"voted for a statewide fracking ban to protect our water.\" The group, the Florida Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee, paid for the mailpiece, but the mailer says that Young approved the message. So we are putting Young on the Truth-O-Meter.\n\nThe mailer refers to Young\u2019s vote on House Bill 191, legislation aimed at regulating fracking in Florida. We were curious about the Young\u2019s statement and the specifics of the measure.\u00a0As we looked further into the bill, we found the mailer is somewhat misleading. What Young voted for would have regulated fracking, but it wouldn\u2019t have permanently banned it.\nA closer look at House Bill 191\nHB 191, dubbed \"Regulation of Oil and Gas Resources,\" was sponsored by Rep. Ray Rodrigues, R-Estero, and passed 73 to 45 on Jan. 27 in the Florida House.\u00a0Young voted in favor of this bill, along with 72 other Republicans, while 38 Democrats and 7 Republicans opposed the bill.\nYoung reasoned that HB 191 could have been the first step to a permanent ban on fracking. However, the bill only called for a temporary moratorium on the process, not a \"ban\" like her mailer says.\nDemocrats who voted against the bill echoed arguments of environmental groups and said a temporary ban doesn\u2019t go far enough to protect Florida\u2019s water.\nHad the bill passed (it was defeated in a Florida Senate committee), the measure would have allowed Florida to regulate fracking \u2014 a process that involves pumping large amounts of water, sand and chemicals into the ground to harness oil and gas reserves.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo shows man upset because he was added to the no-fly list for storming the Capitol.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPer the bill, fracking permits would not have been issued until a study was completed in 2017 by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. The DEP would have proposed rules based on the study\u2019s results, which would have been subject to approval of the Legislature.\nPoint being, the bill was never intended to ban fracking permanently, but place a moratorium on the practice while its effects were studied.\nDemocrats also took issue with the fact the bill would have prohibited Florida's counties and cities from passing local bans against fracking. According to the Miami Herald, 41 cities and 27 counties oppose fracking. St. Petersburg has passed a resolution against hydraulic fracturing, along with Broward County, which outlawed fracking in January.\nIn addition, there were several amendments to HB191 offered up by Democrats that would have created more safeguards against fracking, including a restriction on what chemicals can be used and studies on prenatal health, but they didn\u2019t pass.\nYoung voted against some of these, but her spokesperson said those issues were unnecessary, trusting the DEP study would have addressed those concerns.\nYoung\u2019s office said she strongly opposes fracking in Florida and will continue to seek a statewide ban.\nOur ruling\nA mailer from Young says she \"voted for a statewide ban on fracking.\"\nThat vote is in reference to HB\u00a0191, which would have set up a temporary moratorium on fracking in anticipation of future regulations. The bill would have authorized a study on which to base further regulation. It was not an outright ban on fracking.\nYoung\u2019s claim is partially accurate but is missing context that would give the reader a different impression. For that reason, we rate Young\u2019s statement Half True.\nCorrection: A previous version of this fact-check incorrectly reported who sent the mailer. The piece has been updated to reflect that it was sent by an outside committee with Young's approval.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ed07ec3c-17f2-456c-aded-b343caaff2b7", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04196"}
