Bernie Sanders says by addressing economic inequality, he would also correct racial injustices.\nSanders railed against Wall Street in his response to a question about race relations in the Feb. 11 Democratic debate in Milwaukee, Wis.\n\"Turns out that the African-American community and Latino community were hit especially hard,\" Sanders said. \"As I understand it, the African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse.\"\nThat claim stood out to us. Is it true that black wealth was slashed so dramatically as a result of the financial crisis?\nSanders understood correctly. His campaign referred us to a 2013 report from the National Association of Real Estate Brokers.\n\"According to the report, African-Americans have lost over half of their wealth since the beginning of the recession through falling homeownership rates and loss of jobs,\" it reads.\nThe report refers to Pew Research Center data from 2011 that shows the median net worth of black households decreased by 53 percent from $12,124 in 2005 to $5,677 in 2009. Technically, this loss fits the timeline of the housing crisis in 2006.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA 2014 Pew report more closely follows the financial crisis of 2007. According to that report, median net worth of the black household decreased from $19,200 in 2007 to $11,000 in 2013 (in 2013 dollars). That\u2019s a loss of 43 percent.\nOf course, the two economic crises are intertwined, and both Pew reports note that the housing bubble and the recession that followed \"took a far greater toll on the wealth of minorities than whites.\" Here\u2019s a chart from the Pew Center that demonstrates this: \nCensus Bureau data corroborates, if not magnifies, this point: Black median net worth decreased 61 percent from 2005 to 2009. Whites, in contrast, lost 21 percent of their wealth.\nOur ruling\nSanders said, \"The African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse.\"\nEstimates for how much wealth blacks lost from 2005 to 2009 \u2014 as a result of the housing bubble \u2014 range from 53 percent to 61 percent. African-American net worth plummeted 43 percent from 2007 to 2013 \u2014 as a result of the financial crisis.\nBecause the two financial crises are inseparable, we won\u2019t quibble with Sanders\u2019 timeline.
