Trump, Sen. Marco Rubio and Sen. Ted Cruz sparred over how to deal with people living here illegally and how to secure the southern U.S. border.\nIn the middle of the back-and-forth, Trump made the blanket statement that we wouldn\u2019t be talking about illegal immigration if not for him.\n\"If it weren\u2019t for me \u2026 (illegal immigration) wouldn\u2019t even be a big subject,\" Trump said.\nIt\u2019s a line we\u2019ve heard from Trump since at least August. It was False then, and it\u2019s still False now.\nBack in August, we searched major newspapers for the 51 days before Trump entered the race -- on June 16, 2015 -- and the 51 days after Trump\u2019s announcement.\nWe looked for the terms \"undocumented\" and \"illegal immigrant\" within 10 words of the word \"president.\"\nThe results? The subject of illegal immigration certainly was a subject pre-Trump, and post-Trump.\n\n\n\n\nDate range\n\n\nSearch term\n\n\nNumber of articles\n\n\n\n\nApril 25 to June 15\n\n\nUndocumented\n\n\n65\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 16 to Aug. 6\n\n\nUndocumented\n\n\n42\n\n\n\n\nApril 25 to June 15\n\n\nIllegal immigrant\n\n\n60\n\n\n\n\nJune 16 to Aug. 6\n\n\nIllegal immigrant\n\n\n79\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nSource: Lexis-Nexis\nAnecdotally, Cruz certainly has made illegal immigration a subject of his campaign.\nIn Cruz\u2019s announcement speech for president March 23, 2015, Cruz said, \"Instead of the lawlessness and the president\u2019s unconstitutional executive amnesty, imagine a president that finally, finally, finally secures the borders.\"\nOur ruling\nTrump said, \"If it weren\u2019t for me \u2026 (illegal immigration) wouldn\u2019t even be a big subject.\"\nTrump\u2019s talk about building a wall -- and making Mexico pay for it -- certainly has made headlines.
