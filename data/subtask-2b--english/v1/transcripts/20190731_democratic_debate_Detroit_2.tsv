0042	TAPPER	Welcome back to the CNN Democratic presidential debate.
0043	TAPPER	Candidates, we're about to begin opening statements.
0044	TAPPER	But first, a quick review of the ground rules that your campaigns agreed to earlier this month to try to ensure a fair debate.
0045	TAPPER	As moderators, we will attempt to guide the discussion.
0046	TAPPER	You will each receive one minute to answer questions, 30 seconds for responses and rebuttals, and 15 additional seconds if a moderator asks for a clarification.
0047	TAPPER	The timing lights will remind you of these limits.
0048	TAPPER	Please respect them, and please refrain from interrupting other candidates during their allotted time.
0049	TAPPER	A candidate infringing on another candidate's time will have his or her time reduced.
0050	TAPPER	We, again, remind our audience inside the Fox Theatre to try to remain silent when candidates are actively debating.
0051	TAPPER	The candidates need to be able to properly hear the questions and each other.
0052	BASH	Let's start with opening statements.
0053	BASH	You will each receive one minute.
0054	BASH	Mayor Bill de Blasio, please begin.
0055	DE BLASIO	To the working people of America, tonight I bring you a message of hope.
0056	DE BLASIO	We can make change in this country.
0057	DE BLASIO	I know from personal experience it can be done.
0058	DE BLASIO	When I became the mayor of the nation's largest city, I set us on a path of bold change.
0059	DE BLASIO	They said it couldn't be done, but we gave preK to every child for free.
0060	DE BLASIO	We got rid of stopandfrisk and we lowered crime.
0061	DE BLASIO	We raised the minimum wage to $15 an hour.
0062	DE BLASIO	Yes, it can be done.
0063	DE BLASIO	Now, tonight we have to get to the heart and soul of who we are as Democrats.
0064	DE BLASIO	There are good people on this stage, but there are real differences.
0065	DE BLASIO	Joe Biden told wealthy donors that nothing fundamentally would change if he were president.
0066	DE BLASIO	Kamala Harris said she's not trying to restructure society.
0067	DE BLASIO	Well, I am.
0068	DE BLASIO	For 40 years, working people have taken it on the chin in this country.
0069	DE BLASIO	For 40 years, the rich have gotten richer and they've paid less and less in taxes.
0070	DE BLASIO	It cannot go on this way.
0071	DE BLASIO	When I'm president, we will even up the score and we will tax the hell out of the wealthy to make this a fairer country and to make sure it's a country that puts working people first.

0073	BASH	Thank you, Mayor de Blasio.
0074	BASH	Senator Michael Bennet?
0075	BENNET	Thank you.
0076	BENNET	Last week, I saw one of those Trump signs that says, "America, love it or leave it."
0077	BENNET	And it was on the outside of a church.
0078	BENNET	I love America.
0079	BENNET	And I know we can make it better.
0080	BENNET	Before coming to the Senate I ran (inaudible) school district where most of the kids live in poverty.
0081	BENNET	Those kids have exactly the same hopes that I had.
0082	BENNET	Their parents have exactly the same hopes for them that my parents had for me, and that Susan and I have for our three children.
0083	BENNET	But for the last three years, we've been consumed by a president who frankly doesn't give a damn about your kids or mine.
0084	BENNET	Mr. President kids belong in classrooms, not cages.
0085	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0086	BENNET	And they deserve something better than a bully in the White House.
0087	BENNET	Let's end this three ringed circus in Washington and make  and let's make this election about reclaiming our future for our kids and our democracy.
0088	BENNET	Empty promises won't beat Donald Trump, I can.
0089	BASH	Governor Jay Inslee.
0090	INSLEE	Good evening.
0091	INSLEE	I'm Jay Inslee.
0092	INSLEE	I am running for president because the people in this room and the democrats watching tonight are the last best hope for humanity on this planet.
0093	INSLEE	If  if we make defeating the climate crisis the top priority of the United States, we will have a fighting chance to save ourselves and our children's future.
0094	INSLEE	It has to be our top priority.
0095	INSLEE	My plan is one of national mobilization, quickly bringing 100 percent clean energy to Americans, creating 8 million good union jobs.
0096	INSLEE	This is a big, bold, ambitious plan for clean energy for a big bold ambitious nation.
0097	INSLEE	Middle ground approaches are not enough.
0098	INSLEE	We must confront the fossil fuel industry.
0099	INSLEE	I've been working on this for 25 years.
0100	INSLEE	And now we know this, we are at tipping point and whether we shrink from this challenge or rise to it is the vital question of our time.
0101	INSLEE	We democrats believe we can still do big things in this nation.
0102	INSLEE	We can defeat the climate crisis.
0103	INSLEE	Let's get to work.
0104	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0105	BASH	Senator Kirsten Gillibrand.
0106	GILLIBRAND	My grandmother taught me that nothing's impossible.
0107	GILLIBRAND	She spent two generations organizing women in upstate New York.
0108	GILLIBRAND	My mother taught me nothing's impossible.
0109	GILLIBRAND	She was one of only three women in her law school class and worked with gay couples for basic rights.
0110	GILLIBRAND	If you want to get something done, just tell me it's impossible.
0111	GILLIBRAND	As a freshman senator I was told you couldn't repeal Don't Ask, Don't Tell.
0112	GILLIBRAND	Even members of my own party told me it wasn't convenient.
0113	GILLIBRAND	When are civil rights ever convenient?
0114	GILLIBRAND	We stood up to the Pentagon and we got it done.
0115	GILLIBRAND	Not impossible.
0116	GILLIBRAND	10 years ago I was told you couldn't pass healthcare for our 911 first responders, those heroes who raced up the towers when others were coming down.
0117	GILLIBRAND	Even when Congress turned its back on them, we kept fighting.
0118	GILLIBRAND	Just last week we made the 911 health bill permanent.
0119	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0120	GILLIBRAND	Beating Donald Trump definitely not impossible.
0121	GILLIBRAND	We need a nominee who will take on the big fights and win.
0122	GILLIBRAND	We need a nominee who doesn't know the meaning of impossible.
0123	BASH	Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard.
0124	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0125	GABBARD	I love our country.
0126	GABBARD	It's why I enlisted after 911, why I've served as a soldier for over 16 years, deployed twice to the Middle East, and serve in Congress now for almost seven years.
0127	GABBARD	I know what patriotism is and I've known many great patriots throughout my life.
0128	GABBARD	And let me tell you this, Donald Trump is not behaving like a patriot.
0129	GABBARD	As president I will bring this spirit of real patriotism to the White House, serving the interest of all Americans, not just the rich and powerful.
0130	GABBARD	I'll fight for our rights and freedoms of all Americans, upholding these principles in our constitution upon which our country was founded, fighting for justice and equality for all.
0131	GABBARD	Fighting for every single American regardless of race or religion as we strive towards that more perfect union.
0132	GABBARD	And as president I'll bring this unifying spirit of love for country and the soldier's values of service above self to the White House, truly leading a government of by and for the people.
0133	BASH	Secretary Julian Castro.
0134	CASTRO	Thank you, Dana, and good evening.
0135	CASTRO	You know, just a few days ago we were reminded and inspired by our fellow Americans in Puerto that public service is not fundamentally about any of us it's about you and your family.
0136	CASTRO	I want you to know that, if I'm elected president, that I will work hard every single day so that you and your family can have good health care when you need it, so that your children and grandchildren can get a good education so that they can reach their dreams and that you can have good job opportunities, whether you live here in a big city like Detroit or in a small town in our country.
0137	CASTRO	I know we have a wonderful, special nation but that too many people are struggling.
0138	CASTRO	And I know what that's like, too.
0139	CASTRO	You know, I grew up with a single mom in a poor neighborhood.
0140	CASTRO	But like many of you, I don't want to make America anything again.
0141	CASTRO	I don't want us to go backward.
0142	CASTRO	We're not going back to the past.
0143	CASTRO	We're not going back where we came from.
0144	CASTRO	We're going to move forward.
0145	CASTRO	We're going to make America better than it's ever been in the years to come.
0146	CASTRO	Let's do that together.

0148	BASH	Andrew Yang?
0149	YANG	If you've heard anything about me and my campaign, you've heard that someone is running for president who wants to give every American $1,000 a month.
0150	YANG	I know this may sound like a gimmick, but this is a deeply American idea, from Thomas Paine to Martin Luther King to today.
0151	YANG	Let me tell you why we need to do it and how we pay for it.
0152	YANG	Why do we need to do it?
0153	YANG	We already automated away millions of manufacturing jobs, and chances are your job can be next.
0154	YANG	If you don't believe me, just ask an auto worker here in Detroit.
0155	YANG	How do we pay for it?
0156	YANG	Raise your hand in the crowd if you've seen stores closing where you live.
0157	YANG	It is not just you.
0158	YANG	Amazon is closing 30 percent of America's stores and malls and paying zero in taxes while doing it.
0159	YANG	We need to do the opposite of much of what we're doing right now, and the opposite of Donald Trump is an Asian man who likes math.
0160	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0161	YANG	So let me share the math.
0162	YANG	A thousand dollars a month for every adult would be $461 million every month, right here in Detroit alone.
0163	YANG	The automation of our jobs is the central challenge facing us today.
0164	YANG	It is why Donald Trump is our president, and any politician not addressing it is failing the American people.

0181	BOOKER	Donald Trump, from Charleston to Baltimore to even the border, is using the tired, old language of demagogues, of fearmongers, of racists, to try to divide our country against itself.
0182	BOOKER	We know who Donald Trump is, but in this election, the question is who are we as a people?
0183	BOOKER	We have serious problems in America.
0184	BOOKER	We have deep wounds and seriously deeply rooted challenges.
0185	BOOKER	We desperately need to heal as a nation and move forward.
0186	BOOKER	Because we know in this country that our fates are united, that we have a common destiny.
0187	BOOKER	The call of this election is the call to unite in common cause and common purpose.
0188	BOOKER	That's how we will beat Donald Trump.
0189	BOOKER	That's how I will beat Donald Trump.
0190	BOOKER	And as your president, that's how I will govern and move us forward together.

0192	BASH	Senator Kamala Harris?
0193	HARRIS	This is an inflection moment in the history of our country.
0194	HARRIS	I think we all know that.
0195	HARRIS	This is a moment in time that is requiring us each as individuals and collectively to look in a mirror and ask a question, that question being "Who are we?"
0196	HARRIS	And I think most of us know that part of the answer to that question is we are better than this.
0197	HARRIS	So this then becomes a moment that we must fight for the best of who we are.
0198	HARRIS	And fight, of course, we will.
0199	HARRIS	And this is not a new fight for us as Americans.
0200	HARRIS	We have always been prepared to fight for our ideals.
0201	HARRIS	We have always been a nation that fights for the best of who we are.
0202	HARRIS	And I'll tell you, I come from fighters.
0203	HARRIS	My parents met when they were active in the civil rights movement.
0204	HARRIS	My sister, Maya, and I joke we grew up surrounded by a bunch of adults who spent full time marching and shouting about this thing called justice.
0205	HARRIS	And I am prepared to march with you, to fight with you for the best of who we are and to successfully prosecute the case of four more years of Donald Trump, and against him.
0206	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0207	BASH	Vice President Joe Biden.
0208	BIDEN	Tonight, I think Democrats are expecting some engagement here.
0209	BIDEN	And I expect we'll get it.
0210	BIDEN	I'm running for president to restore the soul of this country.
0211	BIDEN	You know, we have a president, as everybody has acknowledged here, every day is ripping at the social fabric of this country, but no one man has the capacity to rip that apart.
0212	BIDEN	It's too strong.
0213	BIDEN	We're too good.
0214	BIDEN	Just look at this stage, made up of very diverse people from diverse backgrounds, went on to be mayors, senators, governors, congresswomen, members of the cabinet, and, yes, even a vice president.
0215	BIDEN	Mr. President, this is America.
0216	BIDEN	And we are stronger and great because of this diversity, Mr. President, not in spite of it, Mr. President.
0217	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0218	So, Mr. President, let's get something straight	We love it.
0219	So, Mr. President, let's get something straight	We are not leaving it.
0220	So, Mr. President, let's get something straight	We are here to stay.
0221	So, Mr. President, let's get something straight	And we're certainly not going to leave it to you.
0222	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0223	BASH	Thank you, Vice President Biden.
0224	BASH	I want to start the debate with one of the top priorities for Democratic voters, and that is health care.
0225	BASH	Senator Harris, this week you released a new health care plan which would preserve private insurance and take 10 years to phase in.
0226	BASH	Vice President Biden's campaign calls your plan, quote, "a haveiteverywhichway approach" and says it's just part of a confusing pattern of equivocating about your health care stance.
0227	BASH	What do you say to that?
0228	HARRIS	Well, they're probably confused because they've not read it.
0229	HARRIS	But the reality is that I have been spending time in this campaign listening to American families, listening to experts, listening to health care providers, and what I came away with is a very clear understanding that I needed to create a plan that was responsive to the needs of the American people, responsive to their needs understanding that insurance companies have been jacking up the prices for far too long, that American families have to be held down by deductibles and copays and premiums that can cause them bankruptcy.
0230	HARRIS	I listened to the American families who said four years is just not enough to transition into this new plan, so I devised a plan where it's going to be 10 years of a transition.
0231	HARRIS	I listened to American families who said I want an option that will be under your Medicare system that allows a private plan.
0232	HARRIS	So I designed a plan where, yes, responsive to the needs of American families, there will be a public plan, under my plan for Medicare, and a private plan, under my plan for Medicare.
0233	Because the bottom line is this	We must agree that access to health care must be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it.
0234	Because the bottom line is this	And in America today, far too many people  in fact, 30 million people  are going without access to health care.
0235	BASH	Thank you, Senator.
0236	BASH	Thank you, Senator Harris.
0237	BASH	Vice President Biden, your response.
0238	BIDEN	Well, my response is that the senator has had several plans so far.
0239	BIDEN	And any time someone tells you you're going to get something good in 10 years, you should wonder why it takes 10 years.
0240	BIDEN	If you noticed, there is no talk about the fact that the plan in 10 years will cost $3 trillion.
0241	BIDEN	You will lose your employerbased insurance.
0242	BIDEN	And in fact, you know, this is the single most important issue facing the public.
0243	BIDEN	And to be very blunt and to be very straightforward, you can't beat President Trump with doubletalk on this plan.
0244	BASH	Your response, Senator Harris?
0245	HARRIS	Absolutely.
0246	HARRIS	Unfortunately, Vice President Biden, you're just simply inaccurate in what you're describing.
0247	HARRIS	The reality is that our plan will bring health care to all Americans under a Medicare for All system.
0248	HARRIS	Our plan will allow people to start signing up on the first day.
0249	HARRIS	Babies will be born into our plan, and right now, 4 million babies almost are born every day in America  or every year in America.
0250	HARRIS	Under our plan, we will ensure that everyone has access to health care.
0251	HARRIS	Your plan, by contrast, leaves out almost 10 million Americans.
0252	HARRIS	So I think that you should really think about what you're saying, but be reflective and understand that the people of America want access to health care and do not want cost to be their barrier to getting it.
0253	BASH	Senator Harris, thank you.
0254	BASH	Vice President Biden, your response?
0255	BIDEN	The plan, no matter how you cut it, costs $3 trillion when it is, in fact, employed, number one.
0256	BIDEN	Ten years from now, after two terms of the senator being president, after her time.
0257	BIDEN	Secondly, it will require middleclass taxes to go up, not down.
0258	BIDEN	Thirdly, it will eliminate employerbased insurance.
0259	BIDEN	And fourthly, what happens in the meantime?
0260	HARRIS	I'd like to respond.
0261	HARRIS	First of all, the cost of doing nothing is far too expensive.
0262	HARRIS	Second, we are now paying $3 trillion a year for health care in America.
0263	HARRIS	Over the next 10 years, it's probably going to be $6 trillion.
0264	HARRIS	We must act.
0265	HARRIS	My plan is about immediately allowing people to sign up and get into coverage.
0266	HARRIS	Right now in America, we have seniors, who every day  millions of seniors are going into the Medicare system and they are getting full coverage and the kind of coverage they need.
0267	HARRIS	All people should have access to health care.
0268	HARRIS	And costs should not be their barrier.
0269	BASH	Thank you, Senator Harris.
0270	BASH	Mayor de Blasio, let's bring you in here.
0271	BASH	What's your response?
0272	DE BLASIO	Thank you.
0273	DE BLASIO	I don't know what the vice president and the senator are talking about.
0274	DE BLASIO	The folks I talk to about health insurance say that their health insurance isn't working for them.
0275	DE BLASIO	There's tens of millions of Americans who don't even have health insurance, tens of millions more who have health insurance they can barely make work because of the copays, the deductibles, the premiums, the outofpocket expenses.
0276	DE BLASIO	There's this mythology that somehow all of these folks are in love with their insurance in America.
0277	DE BLASIO	What I hear from union members and from hardworking, middleclass people is they wish they had better insurance and they're angry at private insurance companies that skim all the profits off the top and make it impossible for everyday people to get coverage like mental care...
0278	BASH	Thank you, Mr. Mayor.
0279	DE BLASIO	... dental care, the things that would be full coverage for all Americans.
0280	BASH	Thank you, Mr. Mayor.
0281	BASH	Vice President Biden, you just heard Mayor de Blasio.
0282	BASH	He said in the past that Democrats who wanted to keep the private insurance industry are defending a health care system that is not working.
0283	BASH	What's your response?
0284	BIDEN	My response is, Obamacare is working.
0285	BIDEN	The way to build this and get to it immediately is to build on Obamacare.
0286	BIDEN	Go back and do  take back all the things that Trump took away, provide a public option, meaning every single person in America would be able to buy into that option if they didn't like their employer plan, or if they're on Medicaid, they'd automatically be in the plan.
0287	BIDEN	It would take place immediately.
0288	BIDEN	It would move quickly.
0289	BIDEN	And it would insure the vast, vast, vast majority of Americans.
0290	BIDEN	In the meantime, what happens?
0291	BIDEN	Did anybody tell you how much their plans cost?
0292	BIDEN	My plan costs $750 billion.
0293	BIDEN	That's what it costs.
0294	BIDEN	Not $30 trillion.
0295	BASH	Thank you, Mr. Vice President.
0296	BASH	Senator Gillibrand, you support Medicare for All.
0297	BASH	How do you feel about Senator Harris continuing to call her health proposal Medicare for All, when it includes a far more significant role for private insurance than the bill you cosponsored?
0298	GILLIBRAND	I think for the viewers in the audience right now, they're at risk of losing the forest through the trees, because the truth is, health care in America should be a right.
0299	GILLIBRAND	When I was a young mother and had Theo as an infant, he had an allergic reaction to eggs and his whole body turned red and puffy.
0300	GILLIBRAND	I had to rush him to the emergency room.
0301	GILLIBRAND	My heart is palpitating because I'm worried that his throat will close.
0302	GILLIBRAND	I am not worried about not having an insurance card or a credit card in my wallet.
0303	GILLIBRAND	I know whatever they're going to prescribe, whether it's an EpiPen or an inhaler, I can afford it.
0304	GILLIBRAND	The truth about health care in America today is people can't afford it.
0305	GILLIBRAND	They cannot afford  and the insurance companies for these plans that rely on insurance companies, I'm sorry, they're forprofit companies.
0306	GILLIBRAND	They have an obligation to their shareholders.
0307	GILLIBRAND	They pay their CEO millions of dollars.
0308	GILLIBRAND	They have to have quarterly profits.
0309	GILLIBRAND	They have fat in the system that's real and it should be going to health care.
0310	GILLIBRAND	So let's not lose the forest for the trees.
0311	GILLIBRAND	And last, let's not forget what the Republicans are doing, because the truth is, the Republicans and Trump, their whole goal is to take away your health care.
0312	BASH	Thank you.
0313	GILLIBRAND	To make it harder for you to afford it, even if you have preexisting conditions.
0314	BASH	Thank you, Senator Gillibrand.
0315	BASH	Senator Harris, your response?
0316	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0317	HARRIS	In response to Senator Biden about the Affordable Care Act, it is important that you understand that our Medicare for All plan has actually by the architect of the Obama Affordable Care Act been described as one of the most effective ways to bring health care to all.
0318	HARRIS	Kathleen Sebelius has endorsed our plan as being something that will get us to where we need to go.
0319	HARRIS	In terms of the point that Senator Gillibrand is raising, I couldn't agree more.
0320	HARRIS	Senator Biden, your plan will keep and allow insurance companies to remain with status quo, doing business as usual, and that's going to be about jacking up copays, jacking up deductibles...
0321	BASH	Thank you, Senator.
0322	HARRIS	It will still be the situation that people going to an emergency room...
0323	BASH	Thank you, Senator Harris.
0324	BASH	Vice President Biden, your response?
0325	HARRIS	... have to come out $5,000.
0326	BIDEN	My plan makes a limit of copay to be $1,000, because we further support the  the ability to buy into the Obamacare plan.
0327	BIDEN	Secondly, the idea that this is somehow a bad idea, no one has to keep their private insurance, but they  if they like their insurance, they should be able to keep it.
0328	BIDEN	Nothing is demanded in my plan that there be private insurance.
0329	BIDEN	It says, if the 160 million who have it say they like their employer insurance, they should have a right to have it.
0330	BIDEN	If they don't, they can buy into the Biden plan, which is Obamacare with 
0331	BASH	Thank you, Mr. Vice President.
0332	BASH	Thank you.
0333	BASH	Senator Booker, let me bring you in here.
0334	BASH	You say you support Medicare for All.
0335	BASH	You also say you are not going to pull private health insurance from more than 150 million Americans in exchange for a government plan, but that's what Medicare for All would do.
0336	BASH	So how do you square that?
0337	BOOKER	Well, first of all, let me just say, that the person that's enjoying this debate most right now is Donald Trump, as we pit Democrats against each other, while he is working right now to take away Americans' healthcare.
0338	BOOKER	There is a court case working through the system that's going to gut the Affordable Care Act and actually gut protections on preexisting conditions.
0339	BOOKER	And so, I was raised by two civil rights parents who told me, always keep your eyes on the prize.
0340	BOOKER	And that is that in the United States of America, every Democrat should stand with the belief that everyone should have access to healthcare, that it's a human right.
0341	BOOKER	And how we get there, it has to be to end this broken system, because we are on our way, just a handful of years of literally spending 20 percent of our economy, one out of every $5 spent on healthcare.
0342	BOOKER	And we spend more than every other nation, on everything from MRIs to insulin drugs, multiple mores than other countries  multiple more than other countries.
0343	BOOKER	And so, do you want to know what I'm going to do?
0344	BOOKER	I'm going to work to get us to a point where Medicare for All  where everyone is covered.
0345	BOOKER	But this pitting against progressives against moderates, saying one is unrealistic and the other doesn't care enough, that to me is dividing our party and demoralizing us in face of the real enemy here.
0346	BOOKER	And I'm 
0347	BASH	Thank you, Senator.
0348	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0349	BOOKER	 going to keep fighting for that.
0350	BASH	Congressman Gabbard, what's your response?
0351	GABBARD	The reality is right now, we don't have a healthcare system.
0352	GABBARD	We have a sick care system, and there are far too many people in this country who are sick and unable to get the care that they need because they cannot afford it.
0353	GABBARD	So the core of this problem is the fact that big insurance companies and big pharmaceutical companies who've been profiting off the backs of sick people have had a seat at the table, writing this legislation.
0354	GABBARD	Now, Kamala Harris just talked about Kathleen Sebelius who helped write her bill.
0355	GABBARD	This just pointed to the fatal flaw in her proposal.
0356	GABBARD	Sebelius works for Medicare Advantage, a private insurance company who will stand to profit under her plan.
0357	GABBARD	If we're seeking to really reform our healthcare system, we've got to shut out big insurance and big pharma out of the drafting process so they cannot continue to profit off the backs of the sick people in this country who are searching and in desperate need of care.
0358	BASH	Senior Harris, your response?
0359	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0360	HARRIS	Well, unfortunately, Representative Gabbard got it wrong.
0361	HARRIS	Kathleen Sebelius did not write my plan she endorsed it as being one of the plans that is the best to get us to a place where everyone is going to have access to healthcare in America.
0362	HARRIS	And when we talk about this again, I'm going to back to Vice President Biden, because your plan does not cover everyone in America.
0363	HARRIS	By your staffs and your own definition, 10 million people  as many as 10 million people will not have access to healthcare.
0364	HARRIS	And in 2019 in America, for a Democrat to be running for president with a plan that does not cover everyone, I think is without excuse.
0365	HARRIS	Our plan covers everyone 
0366	BASH	Thank you, Senator.
0367	HARRIS	 and gives people choice
0368	BASH	Thank you, Senator.
0369	BASH	Vice President Biden, your response?
0370	BIDEN	My plan does  will cover everyone, number one.
0371	BIDEN	Number two, the fact is that my plan also calls for controlling drug prices.
0372	BIDEN	The biopharma is now where things are going to go.
0373	BIDEN	It's no longer chemicals.
0374	BIDEN	It's about all these breakthroughs that we have, with the whole (ph)  excuse me, immune system.
0375	BIDEN	And what we have to do now is we have to have a form that sits in HHS and says, as you develop a drug, you got to come to us and decide what you can sell it for.
0376	BIDEN	We will set the price.
0377	BIDEN	And secondly, it says that you cannot raise that price beyond the cost of inflation from this point on.
0378	TAPPER	Thank you, Mr. Vice President.
0379	TAPPER	I want to bring in Senator Bennet.
0380	TAPPER	Last night, on this stage, one of your democratic rivals suggested that running on Medicare for All would get Donald Trump reelected.
0381	BENNET	I agree that it makes it much more likely.
0382	BENNET	Unlike others on this stage, I've been crystal clear of where I've been for a decade, through two tough races in Colorado.
0383	BENNET	I believe we should finish the job we started with the Affordable Care Act with a public option that gives everybody in this audience the chance to pick for their family, whether they want private insurance or public insurance.
0384	BENNET	It requires the drug companies to be negotiated with by Medicare and it provides competition.
0385	BENNET	That is totally different from the plan that Senator Warren and Senator Sanders and Senator Harris have proposed, which would make illegal employer based health insurance in this country and massively raise taxes on the middle class to the tune of $30 trillion.
0386	BENNET	As Joe Biden said, we don't need to do that.
0387	BENNET	It doesn't make sense for us to take away insurance from half the people in this room and  and put huge taxes on almost everybody in this room when we pass a public option, trust the American people to make the right decision, and have universal healthcare in this country in two years, not 10 years.
0388	TAPPER	Thank you, Senator.
0389	TAPPER	Secretary Castro, I want to bring you in ...
0390	HARRIS	I  I need to respond.
0391	TAPPER	Your response.
0392	TAPPER	I'll come to you right after Secretary Castro.
0393	TAPPER	Secretary Castro.
0394	CASTRO	Well, I know that this is something very personal for all Americans.
0395	CASTRO	You know I grew up with a grandmother that had diabetes and I watched as her condition got worse and worse.
0396	CASTRO	That whole time she had Medicare.
0397	CASTRO	I want to strengthen Medicare for the people who are on it and then expand it to anybody who wants it.
0398	CASTRO	I also believe thought that if somebody has a private health insurance plan that is strong that they want to hold on to that they should be able to do that.
0399	CASTRO	What I don't believe is that the profit motive of big pharma or big insurance companies should ever determine, in our great nation, whether somebody gets healthcare or not.
0400	TAPPER	Thank you, Secretary Castro.
0401	TAPPER	Senator Harris, Senator Bennet had suggested that you support banning employer based health insurance.
0402	TAPPER	Is that true?
0403	HARRIS	Well first of all, with all due respect to my friend, Michael Bennet, my plan does not offer anything that is illegal.
0404	HARRIS	What it does is it separates the employer from healthcare, meaning that where you work will not be a  where  the kind of healthcare you get will not be a function of where you work.
0405	HARRIS	I have me met so many Americans who stick to a job that they do not like, where they are not prospering simply because they need the healthcare that that employer provides.
0406	HARRIS	It's time that we separate employers from the kind of healthcare people get and under my plan we do that as it relates to the insurance and the pharmaceutical companies ....
0407	TAPPER	Thank you, Senator.
0408	HARRIS	Who will not be called in and who will not be taken to task by Senator Biden or Senator Bennet's plan ...
0409	TAPPER	Thank you, Senator.
0410	HARRIS	We will do that.
0411	TAPPER	Senator Bennet, I want to bring you back.
0412	BENNET	Senator Harris is my friend as well, but I have to say if we can't admit  if we can't admit tonight what's in the plan, which is banning employer based insurance, we're not going to be able to admit that when Donald Trump is accusing democrats of doing that as well.
0413	BENNET	We need to be honest about what's in this plan.
0414	BENNET	It bans employer based insurance and taxes the middle class to the tune of $30 trillion.
0415	BENNET	Do you know how much that is?
0416	BENNET	That is 70 percent of what the government will collect in taxes over the next 10 years.
0417	TAPPER	Thank you, Senator.
0418	BENNET	We don't need to do that.
0419	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0420	BENNET	We can have a public option to have universal healthcare in this country.
0421	TAPPER	I do want to bring in Senator Harris because he just suggested you were not being honest.
0422	HARRIS	He  we cannot keep with the republican talking points on this.
0423	HARRIS	You got to stop.
0424	HARRIS	The reality is that  what  under my Medicare for All plan, yes, employers are not going to be able to dictate the kind of healthcare that their employees get.
0425	HARRIS	They will be able to make that decision.
0426	HARRIS	Private insurance companies and private carriers, if they comply by our rules and play by our rules, will be able to offer those employees healthcare coverage under a private Medicare plan or they can have the option of a public Medicare plan.
0427	HARRIS	But it is misleading to suggest that employees want what their employer is offering only.
0428	HARRIS	They want choice and my plan gives that to them.
0429	TAPPER	Thank.
0430	TAPPER	Thank you, Senator.
0431	TAPPER	Governor Inslee, I want to bring you in.
0432	TAPPER	You recently signed a public option into law, which allows Washington State residents to purchase a state backed plan if they want to.
0433	TAPPER	But this may only save families in Washington State as little as 5 percent off premiums.
0434	TAPPER	Is 5 percent really the kind of relief that the American people need?
0435	INSLEE	No, we need universal coverage.
0436	INSLEE	And I'm proud of our state that has done less squabbling and actually getting things done.
0437	INSLEE	And I am proud that we are the first state to offer a publically sanctioned offer of healthcare to our citizens.
0438	INSLEE	I'm also proud that we didn't stop there.
0439	INSLEE	We're also the first state that has taken care of our elders, our seniors.
0440	INSLEE	We have a looming retirement wave coming up.
0441	INSLEE	I'm proud that our state  our state has made them eligible to retire in dignity.
0442	INSLEE	I'm also proud of this and I think we need to talk more about this as democrats, it is time to give people adequate mental healthcare in this country.
0443	INSLEE	And we are  we are ...
0444	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0445	INSLEE	We are having  we've had some success in integrating mental health with physical health.
0446	INSLEE	There's no reason we should distinguish between your physiological and your mental health.
0447	INSLEE	And the last thing we're doing, I think it's very instructive for the nation.
0448	INSLEE	We know we're being eaten alive by pharmaceutical cost.
0449	INSLEE	We have had one of, if not the most, innovative way to drive down pharmaceuticals for life saving medications in the United States.
0450	INSLEE	We have had one of, if not the most innovative way to drive down pharmaceuticals for lifesaving medications in the United States.
0451	INSLEE	That's a record of Washington state I'd like to take to Washington, D.C.
0452	TAPPER	Thank you.
0453	TAPPER	Thank you, Governor Inslee.
0454	TAPPER	Mr. Yang, I want to bring you in.
0455	TAPPER	You support a Medicare for All system.
0456	TAPPER	How do you respond to Governor Inslee?
0457	YANG	Well, I just want to share a story.
0458	YANG	When I told my wife I was running for president, you know the first question she asked me?
0459	YANG	What are we going to do about our health care?
0460	YANG	That's a true story, and it's not just us.
0461	YANG	Democrats are talking about health care in the wrong way.
0462	YANG	As someone who's run a business, I can tell you flat out our current health care system makes it harder to hire, it makes it harder to treat people well and give them benefits and treat them as fulltime employees, it makes it harder to switch jobs, as Senator Harris just said, and it's certainly a lot harder to start a business.
0463	YANG	If we say, look, we're going to get health care off the backs of businesses and families, then watch American entrepreneurship recover and bloom.
0464	YANG	That's the argument we should be making to the American people.
0465	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0466	TAPPER	Thank you, Mr. Yang.
0467	TAPPER	Mayor de Blasio?
0468	DE BLASIO	Yeah, I don't understand why Democrats on this stage are fearmongering about universal health care.
0469	DE BLASIO	It makes no sense.
0470	DE BLASIO	Ask the American people, they are sick of what the pharmaceutical companies are doing to them.
0471	DE BLASIO	Ask them what they feel about the health insurance companies.
0472	DE BLASIO	They feel it's holding back their families because they can't get the coverage they need.
0473	DE BLASIO	They get a lot of noes.
0474	DE BLASIO	They don't get a lot of help from health insurance companies.
0475	DE BLASIO	Why are we not going to be the party that does something bold, that says we don't need to be dependent on private insurance?
0476	DE BLASIO	We can have a system that actually covers everyone.
0477	DE BLASIO	You know what?
0478	DE BLASIO	Donald Trump won this state of Michigan by saying he was going to disrupt the status quo.
0479	DE BLASIO	How about we be the party that's going to disrupt the status quo for working people?
0480	TAPPER	Thank you.
0481	TAPPER	Mr. Mayor, just a 15second point of clarification.
0482	TAPPER	Who are you talking about?
0483	TAPPER	Who's fearmongering?
0484	DE BLASIO	Certainly, with all due respect to Senator Bennet, what he's saying is absolutely inaccurate about taxes.
0485	DE BLASIO	Americans right now are paying so much money for their health care, ask people about the reality of premiums, deductibles, copays, outofpocket expenses.
0486	TAPPER	Thank you.
0487	DE BLASIO	That's worse than any tax, and people are paying that right now.
0488	TAPPER	Thank you, Mr. Mayor.
0489	TAPPER	Senator Bennet?
0490	BENNET	This  this is  this has nothing to do with Republican talking points or the pharmaceutical industry.
0491	BENNET	This has to do with having faith in the American people that they can make the right decisions for their families and they can choose a public option.
0492	BENNET	Bernie Sanders, who said last night he wrote the damn bill, and he did, just like I wrote the damn public option bill, is the guy who says it will cost $32 trillion and that we're going to have to raise those taxes to pay for it.
0493	BENNET	He says that.
0494	BENNET	Republicans don't say it.
0495	BENNET	Don't try to district from the truth.
0496	TAPPER	Thank you, Senator Bennet.
0497	BENNET	You can't hide from the truth.
0498	TAPPER	I want to let Mayor de Blasio  and then I'm going to come to you, Vice President Biden.
0499	BENNET	We need to be for universal health care.
0500	DE BLASIO	Senator, if we as Democrats say we're done with private insurance, has only hurt the American people in so many ways, we're going to give them something that works for their family's full coverage that they can depend on.
0501	DE BLASIO	If we say that, then there's an election.
0502	DE BLASIO	The American people get to decide.
0503	DE BLASIO	The ultimate choice, Senator, is an election, and this should be the party that stands for universal health care and says we're not going to accept anything less.
0504	DE BLASIO	Right now, in America, so many people don't have the health care they need.
0505	DE BLASIO	That is a fact.
0506	DE BLASIO	Tens of millions of people, including middle class people.
0507	TAPPER	Thank you, Mr. Mayor.
0508	DE BLASIO	Give them a chance to make that decision through an election.
0509	TAPPER	Thank you, Mr. Mayor.
0510	TAPPER	Vice President Biden, your response, sir?
0511	BIDEN	This is not a Republican talking point.
0512	BIDEN	The Republicans are trying to kill Obamacare.
0513	BIDEN	Obamacare took care of 20 million people right off the bat, 100 million people with preexisting conditions.
0514	BIDEN	And in fact, what we got is a public option that, in fact, would allow anybody to buy in.
0515	BIDEN	No one has to keep their private insurance.
0516	BIDEN	They can buy into this plan.
0517	BIDEN	And they can buy into it with $1,000 deductible and never have to pay more than 8.5 percent of their income when they do it.
0518	BIDEN	And if they don't have any money, they'll get in free.
0519	BIDEN	So this idea is a bunch of malarkey, what we're talking about here.
0520	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0521	BIDEN	The fact of the matter is  the fact of the matter is that there will be a deductible.
0522	BIDEN	It will be a deductible on their paycheck.
0523	BIDEN	Bernie acknowledges it.
0524	BIDEN	Bernie acknowledges it.
0525	BIDEN	Thirty trillion dollars has to ultimately be paid.
0526	BIDEN	And I don't know what math you do in New York, I don't know what math you do in California, but I tell ya, that's a lot of money, and there will be a deductible.
0527	BIDEN	The deductible will be out of your paycheck, because that's what will be required.
0528	TAPPER	Senator Harris, I want to bring you in here.
0529	TAPPER	Your response?
0530	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0531	HARRIS	Yeah, let's talk about math.
0532	HARRIS	Let's talk about math.
0533	HARRIS	Let's talk about the fact that the pharmaceutical companies and the insurance companies last year alone profited $72 billion, and that is on the backs of American families.
0534	HARRIS	And under your plan, status quo, you do nothing to hold the insurance companies to task for what they have been doing to American families.
0535	HARRIS	In America today, diabetes patients, one in four cannot afford their insulin.
0536	HARRIS	In America today...
0537	TAPPER	Thank you, Senator.
0538	HARRIS	... for those people who have overdosed from an opioid, there is a syringe that costs $4,000 that will save their life.
0539	TAPPER	Thank you, Senator.
0540	HARRIS	It is immoral.
0541	HARRIS	It is untenable.
0542	TAPPER	Thank you, Senator.
0543	HARRIS	And it must change with Medicare for All.
0544	TAPPER	Your time is up, Senator.
0545	TAPPER	Vice President Biden, your response?
0546	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0547	BIDEN	Real quick.
0548	BIDEN	I have the only plan that limits the ability of insurance companies to charge unreasonable prices, flat out, number one.
0549	BIDEN	Number two, we should put some of these insurance executives who totally oppose my plan in jail for of the $9 billion opioids they sell out there.
0550	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0551	BIDEN	They are misrepresenting to the American people what needs to be done.
0552	BIDEN	And, lastly, here's the deal.
0553	BIDEN	The deal is, let's figure out how this works.
0554	BIDEN	We immediately are able to cover everybody who wants to get off of their insurance plan they don't like, no matter what one it is, and buy into a Medicare option.
0555	BIDEN	And they can buy the gold plan, and they're not going to have to pay  anyway...
0556	LEMON	Thank you, Mr. Vice President.
0557	LEMON	Thank you.
0558	LEMON	Let's move now to immigration, please.
0559	LEMON	Secretary Castro, you think it should no longer be a crime to cross the U.S. border illegally.
0560	LEMON	President Obama's homeland security secretary, Jeh Johnson, whom you served with, says that is a public declaration that the border is, quote, "effectively open to all."
0561	LEMON	How is he wrong?
0562	CASTRO	Thank you for that question.
0563	CASTRO	You know, if you elect me president, you're not electing me to follow.
0564	CASTRO	You're electing me to lead.
0565	CASTRO	And open borders is a rightwing talking point, and frankly I'm disappointed that some folks, including some folks on this stage, have taken the bait.
0566	CASTRO	The only way that we're going to guarantee that we don't have family separations in this country again is to repeal Section 1325 of the Immigration Nationality Act.
0567	CASTRO	That is the law that this president, this administration is using to incarcerate migrant parents and then physically separate them from their children.
0568	CASTRO	My immigration plan would also make sure that we put undocumented immigrants who haven't committed a serious crime on a pathway to citizenship, that we do a 21st century Marshall Plan with Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala, so that we can get to the root of this challenge so people can find safety and opportunity at home instead of having to come to the United States.
0569	CASTRO	That's how we can be smarter, more effective, and more humane when it comes to immigration policy.
0570	LEMON	Thank you, Secretary Castro.
0571	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0572	LEMON	Senator Bennet, what's your response?
0573	BENNET	I disagree that we should decriminalize our border.
0574	BENNET	This is personal for me.
0575	BENNET	My mom is an immigrant, and she was separated from her parents during the Holocaust in Poland.
0576	BENNET	And for those reasons, I was part of the Gang of Eight that wrote  I wrote the immigration bill in 2013 with John McCain that passed the Senate with 68 votes, that gave a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented people that are here, that would pass the most progressive DREAM Act that had ever been conceived, much less passed on the floor of the Senate, and had $46 billion of border security.
0577	BENNET	Every single Democrat voted for that bill...
0578	LEMON	Senator...
0579	BENNET	... and a lot of Republicans.
0580	BENNET	That should be our position.
0581	LEMON	Thank you.
0582	LEMON	Thank you, Senator.
0583	BENNET	That is our position as Democrats.
0584	LEMON	Senator Harris, you have indicated that you don't think it should be a criminal offense punishable by jail to cross the U.S. border illegally.
0585	LEMON	How do you respond to Senator Bennet?
0586	HARRIS	Well, again, with all due respect, you know, I  after the last debate, for example, I went to a place in Florida called Homestead, and there is a private detention facility being paid for by your taxpayer dollars, a private detention facility that currently houses 2,700 children.
0587	HARRIS	And by the way, there were members of us  Julian was there, members of Congress, they would not let us enter the place, members of the United States Congress.
0588	HARRIS	So I walked down the road, I climbed a ladder, and I looked over the fence.
0589	HARRIS	And I'm going to tell you what I saw.
0590	HARRIS	I saw children lined up single file based on gender being walked into barracks.
0591	HARRIS	The policies of this administration have been facilitated by laws on the books...
0592	LEMON	Thank you, Senator.
0593	HARRIS	... that allow them to be incarcerated as though they've committed crimes.
0594	LEMON	Thank you, Senator.
0595	HARRIS	These children have not committed crimes...
0596	LEMON	Thank you, Senator Harris.
0597	HARRIS	... and should be not treated like criminals.
0598	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0599	LEMON	Senator Bennet, what's your response?
0600	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0601	BENNET	I think this is one in the end that we agree with.
0602	BENNET	There's not a single person on this stage if we were president would ever separate a child from their parents at the border.
0603	BENNET	And that is what this...
0604	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0605	BENNET	That is what this administration has done in the American people's name.
0606	BENNET	They have turned our border into a symbol of nativist hostility.
0607	BENNET	The symbol of this country before Donald Trump was president was the Statue of Liberty.
0608	BENNET	That should be the symbol of the United States of America, not Donald Trump's words.
0609	LEMON	Thank you, Senator Bennet.
0610	LEMON	Senator Gillibrand, I want to bring you in.
0611	LEMON	What's your response?
0612	GILLIBRAND	So I think when you talk about whether this should be a crime, you have to remember who we're talking about.
0613	GILLIBRAND	When I was at the Texas border, I visited with women who had fled violence.
0614	GILLIBRAND	A woman from El Salvador owned a small business, gangs came to her and said if you don't give us all your money, we're going to kill your family.
0615	GILLIBRAND	That's why she fled.
0616	GILLIBRAND	Another woman was raped.
0617	GILLIBRAND	That's why she fled.
0618	GILLIBRAND	So this is who we're talking about  and they're not criminals.
0619	GILLIBRAND	So I believe that we should have a civil violation.
0620	GILLIBRAND	No president before President Trump enforced the law in the way he has enforced it.
0621	GILLIBRAND	Because he's using it as the crutch to lock up women and children, to separate mothers and babies, to put them behind bars.
0622	GILLIBRAND	So I don't think we should have a law on the books that can be so misused.
0623	GILLIBRAND	It should be a civil violation and we should make sure that we treat people humanely.
0624	LEMON	Thank you, Senator.
0625	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0626	LEMON	Vice President Biden, in the first two years of the Obama administration, nearly 800,000 immigrants were deported, far more than during President Trump's first two years.
0627	LEMON	Would the higher deportation rates resume if you were president?
0628	BIDEN	Absolutely not, number one.
0629	BIDEN	Number two, everything landed on the president's desk but locusts.
0630	BIDEN	I found that Julian  excuse me  the secretary, we sat together in many meetings.
0631	BIDEN	I never heard him talk about any of this when he was the secretary.
0632	(UNKNOWN)	Three million (ph) (inaudible)
0633	LEMON	Please be respectful.
0634	LEMON	Please be respectful in the crowd.
0635	(UNKNOWN)	Three million (ph) (inaudible)
0636	LEMON	Please continue, Mr. Vice President.
0637	(UNKNOWN)	Three million (ph) (inaudible)
0638	BIDEN	The fact is  the fact is...
0639	(UNKNOWN)	Three million (ph) (inaudible)
0640	BIDEN	I don't know if you can hear.
0641	BIDEN	I can hear.
0642	BIDEN	But anyway...
0643	LEMON	We can hear fine, Mr. Vice President.
0644	BIDEN	OK.
0645	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0646	LEMON	Please continue, if you will.
0647	BIDEN	The fact is what the senator from New York talked about is seeking asylum.
0648	BIDEN	That woman, the women she spoke to are entitled to asylum.
0649	BIDEN	That is not crossing the border illegally.
0650	BIDEN	What we should do is flood the zone to make sure we have people to make those decisions quickly.
0651	BIDEN	With regard to  with regard to the secretary's point, I already proposed and passed...
0652	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0653	BIDEN	... $750 million for Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, to be able to change the circumstance why people fled in the first place.
0654	BIDEN	In addition to that, we're in a circumstance where if in fact you say you can just cross the border, what do you say to all those people around the world who in fact want the same thing to come to the United States and make their case, that they don't  that they have to wait in line.
0655	BIDEN	The fact of the matter is, you should be able to  if you cross the border illegally, you should be able to be sent back.
0656	BIDEN	It's a crime.
0657	BIDEN	It's a crime, and it's not one that in fact...
0658	LEMON	Thank  thank you, Mr. Vice President.
0659	LEMON	Secretary Castro, please, your response?
0660	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0661	CASTRO	Yeah, first of all, Mr. Vice President, it looks like one of us has learned the lessons of the past and one of us hasn't.
0662	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0663	CASTRO	Let me begin by telling you  let me just start out by answering that question.
0664	CASTRO	My immigration plan would also fix the broken legal immigration system, because we do have a problem with that.
0665	BIDEN	I agree.
0666	CASTRO	Secondly, the only way that we're going to guarantee that these kinds of family separations don't happen in the future is that we need to repeal this law.
0667	CASTRO	There's still going to be consequences if somebody crosses the border.
0668	CASTRO	It's a civil action.
0669	CASTRO	Also, we have 654 miles of fencing.
0670	CASTRO	We have thousands of personnel at the border.
0671	CASTRO	We have planes we have boats we have helicopters we have security cameras...
0672	LEMON	Secretary Castro, thank you.
0673	CASTRO	What we need are politicians that actually...
0674	LEMON	Your time is up.
0675	CASTRO	... have some guts on this issue.
0676	LEMON	Thank you, Secretary.
0677	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0678	LEMON	Mr. Vice President, please, your response?
0679	BIDEN	I have guts enough to say his plan doesn't make sense.
0680	BIDEN	Here's the deal.
0681	BIDEN	The fact of the matter is that, in fact, when people cross the border illegally, it is illegal to do it unless they're seeking asylum.
0682	BIDEN	People should have to get in line.
0683	BIDEN	That's the problem.
0684	BIDEN	And the only reason this particular part of the law is being abused is because of Donald Trump.
0685	BIDEN	We should defeat Donald Trump and end this practice.
0686	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0687	LEMON	Thank you.
0688	LEMON	Congresswoman Gabbard, what's your response?
0689	GABBARD	Our hearts break when we see those children at these detention facilities who've been separated from their parents, when we see human beings crowded into cages in abhorrent, inhumane conditions.
0690	GABBARD	This is about leadership and understanding that we can and should have both secure borders as well as humane immigration policies.
0691	GABBARD	We will have to stop separating children from their parents, make it so that it's easier for people to seek asylum in this country, make sure that we are securing our borders and making it so that people are able to use our legal immigration system by reforming those laws.
0692	LEMON	Mr. Yang, your response?
0693	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0694	YANG	I'm the son of immigrants myself.
0695	YANG	My father immigrated here as a graduate student and generated over 65 U.S. patents for G.E.
0696	YANG	and IBM.
0697	YANG	I think that's a pretty good deal for the United States.
0698	YANG	That's the immigration story we need to be telling.
0699	YANG	We can't always be focusing on some of the  the  the distressed stories.
0700	YANG	And if you go to a factory here in Michigan, you will not find walltowall immigrants you will find walltowall robots and machines.
0701	YANG	Immigrants are being scapegoated for issues they have nothing to do with in our economy.
0702	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0703	LEMON	Thank you, Mr. Yang.
0704	LEMON	Senator Booker you have a plan that would, quote, "virtually eliminate immigration detention."
0705	LEMON	Does that mean that the roughly 55,000 migrants currently in detention would be released into the United States?
0706	BOOKER	Well, first of all, I just want to say, again, tonight, we are playing into Republican hands who have a very different view, and they're trying to divide us against each other.
0707	BOOKER	I'm listening to the language of my colleagues.
0708	BOOKER	No, Mr. Vice President, we are not going to just let people cross the border.
0709	BOOKER	An unlawful crossing is an unlawful crossing, if you do it in the civil courts, or if you do in the criminal courts.
0710	BOOKER	But the criminal courts is what is giving Donald Trump the ability to truly violate the human rights of people coming to our country, who no one surrenders their human rights.
0711	BOOKER	And so, doing it through the civil courts means that you won't need these awful detention facilities that I have been to seeing children sleeping on pavement, people being put in cages, nursing mothers, small children.
0712	BOOKER	This is not necessary.
0713	BOOKER	We have seen, using the civil system, piloted programs that have 100 percent compliance with the civil courts, where people are evaluated.
0714	BOOKER	If they have no justifiable reason to be here, they are returned.
0715	BOOKER	If they are, like the people I met in Juarez, who were survivors of sexual assault, who we wouldn't even let come and present for asylum.
0716	BOOKER	We are butchering our values 
0717	LEMON	Senator 
0718	BOOKER	 and making ourselves less safe.
0719	LEMON	Senator Booker, thank you very much.
0720	LEMON	Mr. Vice President, your response?
0721	BIDEN	I agree with the Senator.
0722	BIDEN	The asylum process is a real process, and this president is ruining it.
0723	BIDEN	It has nothing to do with that section of law.
0724	BIDEN	That's what he's doing, number one.
0725	BIDEN	Number two, we should in fact  and we had proposed and we tried to get passed in our administration, I proposed, significantly increasing the number of legal immigrants who are able to come.
0726	BIDEN	This country can tolerate a heck of a lot more people.
0727	BIDEN	And the reason we're the country we are is we've been able to cherry pick from the best of every culture.
0728	BIDEN	Immigrants built this country.
0729	BIDEN	That's why we're so special.
0730	BIDEN	It took courage.
0731	BIDEN	It took resilience.
0732	BIDEN	It took absolutely confidence for them to come.
0733	BIDEN	And we should be encouraging these people.
0734	LEMON	Thank you.
0735	BIDEN	And by the way, anybody that crosses the stage with a  with a  with a PhD, you should get a green card for seven years.
0736	BIDEN	We should keep them here.
0737	LEMON	Thank you.
0738	LEMON	Thank you very much, Mr. Vice President.
0739	LEMON	Governor Inslee, what's your response?
0740	INSLEE	I think we're missing two central statements we need to make.
0741	INSLEE	Number one, we can no longer allow a white nationalist to be in the White House, number one.
0742	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0743	INSLEE	And number two  number two, we have to make America what it's always been, a place of refuge.
0744	INSLEE	We got to boost the number of people we accept.
0745	INSLEE	I'm proud of being the first governor saying send us your Syrian refugees.
0746	INSLEE	I'm proud to have been the first governor to stand up against Donald Trump's Muslim ban.
0747	INSLEE	I'm proud to have sued him 21 times and beat him 21 times in a row.
0748	INSLEE	I'm ready for November 2020.
0749	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0750	LEMON	Go ahead.
0751	LEMON	Mayor de Blasio, please your response?
0752	DE BLASIO	Two points.
0753	DE BLASIO	One, it's all kind of charade because there's 11 million people here, and everyone, in theory, has broken the law, but they're part of our communities now.
0754	DE BLASIO	They're part of our economy.
0755	DE BLASIO	They're our neighbors.
0756	DE BLASIO	Why are we even discussing on one level whether it's a civil penalty or a criminal penalty, when it's an American reality?
0757	DE BLASIO	And what we need is comprehensive immigration, once and for all, to fix it.
0758	DE BLASIO	Second, Vice President Biden, I didn't hear your response when the issue came up of all those deportations.
0759	DE BLASIO	You were vice president of the United States.
0760	DE BLASIO	I didn't hear whether you tried to stop them or not, using your power, your influence in the White House.
0761	DE BLASIO	Do you think it was a good idea, or do you think it was something that needed to be stopped?
0762	LEMON	Mr. Vice President 
0763	BIDEN	The president came along, and he's the guy that came up with the idea the first time ever, dealing with the dreamers.
0764	BIDEN	He put that in the law.
0765	BIDEN	He had talked about a comprehensive plan which he put on the  laid before the Congress, saying that we should find a pathway to citizenship for people.
0766	BIDEN	He said we should up the number of people that we're able to bring in to this country.
0767	BIDEN	Lastly, he also pointed out that we should go to the source of the problem and fix it where people were leaving in the first place.
0768	BIDEN	So he did  to compare him to Donald Trump, I think is absolutely bizarre.
0769	LEMON	Thank you very much, Mr. Vice President.
0770	LEMON	Congresswoman Gabbard, you are a cosponsor of the College for All Act which would make public colleges and universities free for all Americans.
0771	LEMON	One of the authors of that plan, Senator Sanders, believes college should be tuitionfree for undocumented immigrants as well.
0772	LEMON	Do you?
0773	GABBARD	I don't.
0774	GABBARD	I think it's important for us to fix our legal immigration system and look at the millions of undocumented immigrants in this country who have been suffering as they've been living in the shadows.
0775	GABBARD	And instead of putting a bandaid on this problem, fix our legal immigration system to provide them with that pathway to legal residency or citizenships, that they are no longer treated as secondclass citizens in this country.
0776	GABBARD	We've got to look at the challenge that people all across the country are facing, under crushing student debt.
0777	GABBARD	This is something that is impacting my generation in a huge way and I believe that it is our generation that has the bold, creative solutions to be able to solve it.
0778	GABBARD	This is about promise for our future and we've got to make those kinds of investments.
0779	LEMON	Thank you, Congresswoman.
0780	LEMON	Mayor de Blasio, what's your response?
0781	DE BLASIO	Yes, I  I agree with the congress member but I don't hear an answer from the vice president.
0782	DE BLASIO	I'm confused.
0783	DE BLASIO	I asked the vice president point blank, did he use his power to stop those deportations.
0784	DE BLASIO	He went right around the question.
0785	DE BLASIO	Mr. Vice President, you want to be president of the United States, you need to be able to answer the tough questions.
0786	DE BLASIO	I guarantee you if you're debating Donald Trump he's not going to let you off the hook.
0787	DE BLASIO	So did you say those deportations were a good idea or did you go to the president and say this is a mistake, we shouldn't do it.
0788	DE BLASIO	Which one?
0789	BIDEN	I was vice president.
0790	BIDEN	I am not the president.
0791	BIDEN	I keep my recommendation to him in private.
0792	BIDEN	Unlike you I can expect you would go ahead and say whatever was said privately with him.
0793	BIDEN	That is not what I do.
0794	BIDEN	What I do say to you is he moved to fundamentally change the system.
0795	BIDEN	That's what he did.
0796	BIDEN	That's who did.
0797	BIDEN	But much more has to be done.
0798	BIDEN	Much more has to be done.
0799	DE BLASIO	I still don't hear an answer.
0800	LEMON	Senator Booker, please respond.
0801	BOOKER	Well, a couple of things.
0802	BOOKER	First of all, Mr. Vice President, you can't have it both ways.
0803	BOOKER	You invoke President Obama more than anybody in this campaign.
0804	BOOKER	You can't do it when it's convenient and then dodge it when it's not.
0805	BOOKER	And the second thing that this really urkes (ph) me because I heard the vice president say that if you got a PhD., you can come right into this country.
0806	BOOKER	Well that's playing into what the republicans want, to pit some immigrants against other immigrants.
0807	BOOKER	From are from shithole countries and some are from worthy countries.
0808	BOOKER	We need to reform this whole immigration system and begin to be the country that says everyone has worth and dignity and this should be a country that honors for everyone.
0809	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0810	BOOKER	Don't let the republicans divide this party against itself.
0811	LEMON	Senator, thank you.
0812	LEMON	Mr. Vice President, your response.
0813	BIDEN	The fact is that's what I said about this country.
0814	BIDEN	We are a country of immigrants.
0815	BIDEN	All of us.
0816	BIDEN	All of us.
0817	BIDEN	Some here came against their will others came because they in fact thought they could fundamentally change their lives.
0818	BIDEN	And they did.
0819	BIDEN	(Inaudible) that's what we're talking about.
0820	BIDEN	That's what made us great.
0821	BIDEN	And the fact of the matter is, I think the president of the United States, Barack Obama, went out of his way to try to change the system and he got pushed back significantly.
0822	LEMON	Senator Gillibrand, what's your response?
0823	GILLIBRAND	Again, President Trump, under his administration seven children died in his custody.
0824	GILLIBRAND	In  under his administration families have been torn apart.
0825	GILLIBRAND	This party is talking about real ideas for the future.
0826	GILLIBRAND	We're talking about what we will do to change America.
0827	GILLIBRAND	But we must not forget about our values.
0828	GILLIBRAND	We used to believe in this country you should treat others the way you want to be treated.
0829	GILLIBRAND	We used to believe in this country we should care about the least among us.
0830	GILLIBRAND	Let's remind the American people who we are, why we are democrats, and why we're running for president.
0831	LEMON	Senator Gillibrand, thank you very much.
0832	LEMON	The debate will be right back right after this short break.
0833	TAPPER	Welcome back to the CNN Democratic presidential debate.
0834	TAPPER	We are live from Detroit.
0835	TAPPER	I want to turn now to criminal justice.
0836	TAPPER	Mr. Vice President, Senator Booker called your new criminal justice reform plan, quote, "an inadequate solution to what is a raging crisis in our country," unquote.
0837	TAPPER	Why is Senator Booker wrong?
0838	BIDEN	Well, I don't  I think he is wrong.
0839	BIDEN	I think we should work together.
0840	BIDEN	He has a similar plan.
0841	BIDEN	I think that we should change the way we look at prisons.
0842	BIDEN	Right now, we're in a situation where, when someone is convicted of a drug crime, they end up going to jail and to prison.
0843	BIDEN	They should be going to rehabilitation.
0844	BIDEN	They shouldn't be going to prison.
0845	BIDEN	When in prison, they should be learning to read and write and not just sit in there and learn how to be better criminals.
0846	BIDEN	And when they get out of prison, they should be in a situation where they have access to everything they would have had before, including Pell grants for education, including making sure that they're able to have housing, public housing, including they have all the opportunities that were available to them because we want them to become better citizens.
0847	BIDEN	That's the essence of what my plan, in detail, lays out.
0848	BIDEN	I'm happy to discuss it more in detail if the senator would want to.
0849	BIDEN	And so I  you know, I look  anyway, that's what I think my plan  I know what my plan does, and I think it's not dissimilar to what the senator said we should be working together on getting things done.
0850	TAPPER	Senator Booker, your response?
0851	BOOKER	Well, my response is that this is a crisis in our country because we have treated issues of race and poverty, mental health and addiction with locking people up and not lifting them up.
0852	BOOKER	And...
0853	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0854	BOOKER	... Mr. Vice President has said that, since the 1970s, every major crime bill  every crime bill, major and minor, has had his name on it.
0855	BOOKER	And, Sir, those are your words, not  not mine.
0856	BOOKER	And this is one of those instances where the house was set on fire and you claimed responsibility for those laws.
0857	BOOKER	And you can't just now come out with a plan to put out that fire.
0858	BOOKER	We have got to have far more bold action on criminal justice reform, like having true...
0859	TAPPER	Thank you, Senator.
0860	BOOKER	... marijuana justice, which means that we legalize it on a federal level...
0861	TAPPER	Thank you, Senator Booker.
0862	BOOKER	... and reinvest the profits in communities that have been...
0863	TAPPER	Thank you, Senator Booker.
0864	BOOKER	... disproportionately targeted by marijuana enforcement.
0865	TAPPER	Vice President Biden, I want to give you a chance to respond.
0866	BIDEN	The fact is that the bills that the president  that, excuse me, the future president here  that...
0867	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0868	BIDEN	... that the senator is talking about are bills that were passed years ago and they were passed overwhelming.
0869	BIDEN	Since 2007, I, for example, tried to get the crackpowdercocaine totally  disparity totally eliminated.
0870	BIDEN	In 2007 you became mayor and you had a police department that was  you went out and you hired Rudy Giuliani's guy you  and engaged in stopandfrisk.
0871	BIDEN	You had 75 percent of those stops reviewed as illegal.
0872	BIDEN	You found yourself in a situation where three times as many AfricanAmerican kids were caught in that chain and caught up.
0873	BIDEN	The Justice Department came after you for saying you were  you were engaging in behavior that was inappropriate, and then in fact nothing happened, the entire time you were mayor.
0874	TAPPER	Thank you.
0875	TAPPER	Senator Booker, you want to respond?
0876	BOOKER	Well, first of all, I'm grateful that he endorsed my presidency already.
0877	BOOKER	But I'll tell you this, it's no secret that I inherited a criminal  a police department with massive problems and decadeslong challenges.
0878	BOOKER	But the head of the ACLU has already said  the head of the New Jersey ACLU  that I put forth national standardsetting accountability.
0879	BIDEN	That's...
0880	BOOKER	Mr. Vice President  Mr. Vice President, I didn't interrupt you.
0881	BOOKER	Please show me that respect, sir.
0882	BIDEN	I'm sorry (inaudible)
0883	BOOKER	We have a system right now that's broken.
0884	BOOKER	And if you want to compare records  and, frankly, I'm shocked that you do...
0885	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0886	BOOKER	...
0887	BOOKER	I am happy to do that.
0888	BOOKER	Because all the problems that he is talking about, that he created, I actually led the bill that got passed into law that reverses the damage that your bills that you were, frankly  to correct you, Mr. Vice President  you were bragging, calling it the Biden crime bill, up until 2015.
0889	TAPPER	Thank you, Senator.
0890	TAPPER	Vice President Biden?
0891	BIDEN	Number one, the bill he talks about is a bill that in my  our administration, we passed.
0892	BIDEN	We passed that bill that you added onto.
0893	BIDEN	That's the bill, in fact, you passed.
0894	BIDEN	And the fact of the matter is, secondly, there was nothing done for the entire eight years he was mayor, there was nothing done to deal with the police department that was corrupt.
0895	BIDEN	Why did you announce on the first day a zero tolerance policy of stop and frisk and hire Rudy Giuliani's guy in 2007, when I was trying to get rid of the crack cocaine disparity?
0896	BOOKER	Mr. Vice President, there's a saying in my community, you're dipping into the KoolAid and you don't even know the flavor.
0897	BOOKER	You need to come to the city of Newark and see the reforms that we put in place.
0898	BOOKER	The New Jersey head of the ACLU has said that I embraced reforms not just in action, but in deeds.
0899	BOOKER	Sir, you are trying to shift the view from what you created.
0900	BOOKER	There are people right now in prison for life for drug offenses because you stood up and used that "tough on crime" phony rhetoric that got a lot of people elected but destroyed communities like mine.
0901	BOOKER	This isn't about the past, sir.
0902	BOOKER	This is about the present right now.
0903	BOOKER	I believe in redemption.
0904	TAPPER	Thank you, Senator.
0905	BOOKER	I'm happy you evolved.
0906	TAPPER	I want to bring in Secretary...
0907	BOOKER	But you've offered no redemption to the people in prison right now for life.
0908	TAPPER	I want to bring in Secretary Castro.
0909	TAPPER	Your response, sir?
0910	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0911	CASTRO	Yeah, I agree with Senator Booker  I agree with Senator Booker that a lot of what Vice President helped author in '94 was a mistake.
0912	CASTRO	And he has flipflopped on these things.
0913	CASTRO	And that's clear.
0914	CASTRO	But let me say, when we talk about criminal justice reform, there are a lot of things that we can talk about  sentencing reform, cash bail reform, investing in public defenders, diversion programs.
0915	CASTRO	I'm proud that I'm the only candidate that has put forward a police reform plan, because we have a police system that is broken and we need to fix it.
0916	CASTRO	And whether it's the case of someone like Tamir Rice or Michael Brown or Eric Garner, where the Trump Justice Department just decided not to pursue challenges...
0917	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0918	CASTRO	... we need to ensure we have a national use of force standard and that we end qualified immunity for police officers so that we can hold them accountable for using excessive force.
0919	TAPPER	Thank you, Secretary Castro.
0920	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0921	TAPPER	I want to bring in  I want to bring in Governor Inslee.
0922	TAPPER	Governor Inslee, your response?
0923	INSLEE	Let me suggest that people come out to the state of Washington and see what criminal justice reform looks like, our effort to reduce racial disparity.
0924	INSLEE	I'm proud that I was the first governor to offer pardons to thousands of people with drug crimes.
0925	INSLEE	Now we're vacating more, tens of thousands.
0926	INSLEE	We've eliminated the death penalty.
0927	And importantly, we've done this	When people come out of the legal system and they've done their responsibility to the citizens, we need to make sure they can get a job.
0928	And importantly, we've done this	We have banned the box so that people can actually get a job when they come out.
0929	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0930	And importantly, we've done this	And I've got to argue with my friend, Secretary Castro.
0931	And importantly, we've done this	We haven't just put forward a plan.
0932	And importantly, we've done this	We have adopted probably one of the best police accountability measures and trainer police officers and deescalation techniques so we have less violence...
0933	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0934	TAPPER	Secretary  Secretary Castro, your response to Governor Inslee?
0935	CASTRO	Well, that it's much more than that, because what we see  and this was a good example, the other day, of the Department of Justice not going after Officer Pantaleo that  Officer Pantaleo used a chokehold that was prohibited by NYPD.
0936	CASTRO	He did that for seven seconds.
0937	CASTRO	Eleven different times Eric Garner said that he couldn't breathe.
0938	CASTRO	He knew what he was doing, that he was killing Eric Garner, and yet he has not been brought to justice.
0939	CASTRO	That police officer should be off the street.
0940	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0941	TAPPER	Mayor de Blasio?
0942	TAPPER	Mayor de Blasio, why is that police officer still on the force, the one who killed Eric Garner?
0943	TAPPER	Please respond.
0944	DE BLASIO	Well, let me tell you.
0945	DE BLASIO	I know the Garner family.
0946	DE BLASIO	They've gone through extraordinary pain.
0947	DE BLASIO	They are waiting for justice and are going to get justice.
0948	DE BLASIO	There's finally going to be justice.
0949	DE BLASIO	I have confidence in that, in the next 30 days, in New York.
0950	DE BLASIO	You know why?
0951	DE BLASIO	Because for the first time, we are not waiting on the federal Justice Department, which told the city of New York that we could not proceed because the Justice Department was pursuing their prosecution.
0952	DE BLASIO	And years went by, and a lot of the pain accrued.
0953	DE BLASIO	And in the meantime, what I'm working on is making sure  and I have for five years  there will never be another tragedy, there will never be another Eric Garner, because we're changing fundamentally how we police.
0954	TAPPER	Thank you, Mayor.
0955	DE BLASIO	But there's one last point I have to say about the Justice Department.
0956	DE BLASIO	The vice president for twoandahalf of those years, Mr. Vice President, tell us, what did you do to try and spur on the Justice Department to act in the Garner case?
0957	TAPPER	Thank you.
0958	TAPPER	Thank you, Mayor.
0959	TAPPER	Thank you, Mayor de Blasio.
0960	TAPPER	Vice President Biden, you can respond to that.
0961	BIDEN	We did a lot.
0962	BIDEN	Number one, we made sure we reduced the federal prison population by 38,000 people, number one.
0963	BIDEN	Number two, we, in fact, insisted that we change the rules that police engage in.
0964	BIDEN	They had to have  we provided for body cameras.
0965	BIDEN	We made sure  there were a lot of things that were changed in the process, but 38,000 people in the federal system were released under the system.
0966	BIDEN	And so the fact is that there's a lot we've done.
0967	BIDEN	But here's the deal.
0968	BIDEN	The fact is that we're talking about things that occurred a long, long time ago.
0969	BIDEN	And now, all of a sudden, you know  I find it fascinating.
0970	BIDEN	Everybody is talking about how terrible I am on these issues.
0971	BIDEN	Barack Obama knew exactly who I was.
0972	BIDEN	He had 10 lawyers do a background check on everything about me on civil rights and civil liberties, and he chose me, and he said it was the best decision he made.
0973	BIDEN	I'll take his judgment.
0974	TAPPER	Thank you, Mr. Vice President.
0975	YANG	May I, please?
0976	TAPPER	Mr. Yang, your response?
0977	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0978	YANG	I speak for just about everyone watching when I say I would trust anyone on this stage much more than I would trust our current president on matters of criminal justice.
0979	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0980	YANG	We cannot tear each other down.
0981	YANG	We have to focus on beating Donald Trump in 2020.
0982	YANG	I want to share a story that a prison guard, a corrections officer in New Hampshire said to me.
0983	YANG	He said, we should pay people to stay out of jail, because we spend so much when they're behind bars.
0984	YANG	Right now, we think we're saving money, we just end up spending the money in much more dark and punitive ways.
0985	YANG	We should put money directly into people's hands, certainly when they come out of prison, but before they go into prison.
0986	TAPPER	Thank you, Mr. Yang.
0987	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0988	TAPPER	I want to bring in Senator Gillibrand.
0989	TAPPER	You heard earlier Mayor de Blasio respond to Secretary Castro on the question of why the police officer who killed Eric Garner is still on the NYPD.
0990	TAPPER	Was that response adequate?
0991	TAPPER	Please respond.
0992	GILLIBRAND	No.
0993	GILLIBRAND	He should be fired.
0994	GILLIBRAND	He should be fired now.
0995	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0996	GILLIBRAND	I sat  I sat down with Eric Garner's mother.
0997	GILLIBRAND	And I can tell you, when you've lost your son, when he begged for breath, when you know because you have a video, when you know he said "I can't breathe" so many times, over and over again, when you know he used an illegal chokehold, that person should be fired.
0998	GILLIBRAND	And as  if I was  if I was the mayor, I would fire him.
0999	GILLIBRAND	But as president, I would make sure that we had a full investigation, that the report would be made public.
1000	GILLIBRAND	And if I wasn't satisfied, we would have a consent decree.
1001	TAPPER	I want to bring in Senator Harris now.
1002	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1003	TAPPER	Senator Harris, you have also been quite critical of Vice President Biden's policies on race, specifically on the issues of busing in the 1970s, having benefitted from busing when you were a young child.
1004	TAPPER	Vice President Biden says that your current position on busing, you're opposed to federally mandated busing, that that position is the same as his position.
1005	TAPPER	Is he right?
1006	HARRIS	That is simply false.
1007	HARRIS	And let's be very clear about this.
1008	HARRIS	When Vice President Biden was in the United States Senate, working with segregationists to oppose busing, which was the vehicle by which we would integrate America's public schools, had I been in the United States Senate at that time, I would have been completely on the other side of the aisle.
1009	HARRIS	And let's be clear about this.
1010	HARRIS	Had those segregationists their way, I would not be a member of the United States Senate, Cory Booker would not be a member of the United States Senate, and Barack Obama would not have been in the position to nominate him to the title he now holds.
1011	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1012	HARRIS	And so, on that issue, we could not be more apart, which is that the vice president has still failed to acknowledge that it was wrong to take the position that he took at that time.
1013	HARRIS	Now, I would like to also talk about this conversation about Eric Garner, because I, too, met with his mother.
1014	HARRIS	And one of the things that we've got to be clear about is that this president of the United States, Donald Trump, while he has been in office, has quietly been allowing the United States Department of Justice to shut down consent decrees, to stop pattern and practice investigations.
1015	HARRIS	On that case, we also know that the...
1016	TAPPER	Thank you, Senator.
1017	HARRIS	... Civil Rights Division  this is important.
1018	HARRIS	The Civil Rights Division of the United States Department of Justice said charges should have been filed, but this United States Department of Justice usurped  and I believe it is because that president did not want those charges to go forward.
1019	HARRIS	And they overrode a decision by the Civil Rights Division of the United States Department of Justice.
1020	TAPPER	Thank you, Senator.
1021	HARRIS	Under my administration, the Civil Rights Division...
1022	TAPPER	Thank you, Senator.
1023	HARRIS	... will rein and there will be independent investigations.
1024	TAPPER	Vice President Biden, Vice President Biden, I want to give you a chance to respond to what Senator Harris just said.
1025	BIDEN	When Senator Harris was attorney general for eight years in the state of California, there were two of the most segregated school districts in the country, in Los Angeles and in San Francisco.
1026	BIDEN	And she did not  I didn't see a single solitary time she brought a case against them to desegregate them.
1027	BIDEN	Secondly, she also was in a situation where she had a police department when she was there that in fact was abusing people's right.
1028	BIDEN	And the fact was that she in fact was told by her own people that her own staff that she should do something about and disclose to defense attorney's like me that you in fact have been  the police officer did something that did not give you information of what (inaudible) your  your client.
1029	BIDEN	She didn't do that.
1030	BIDEN	She never did it.
1031	BIDEN	And so what happened.
1032	BIDEN	Along came a federal judge and said enough, enough.
1033	BIDEN	And he freed 1,000 of these people.
1034	BIDEN	If you doubt me, google 1,000 prisoners freed, Kamala Harris.
1035	TAPPER	Thank you, Vice President Biden.
1036	TAPPER	Senator Harris, your response.
1037	HARRIS	That is  is simply not true.
1038	HARRIS	And as attorney general of California where I ran the second largest Department of Justice in the United States, second only to the United States Department of Justice, I am proud of the work we did.
1039	HARRIS	Work that has received national recognition for what has been the important work of reforming a criminal justice system and cleaning up the consequences of the bills that you passed when you were in the United States Senate for decades.
1040	HARRIS	It was the work of creating the  one of the first in the nation initiatives around reentering former offenders and getting them jobs and counseling.
1041	TAPPER	Thank you, Senator.
1042	HARRIS	I did the work as attorney general of putting body cameras on special agents in the state of California.
1043	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
1044	TAPPER	I want to bring in Congresswoman ....
1045	HARRIS	And I'm proud of that work.
1046	TAPPER	I want to bring in Congresswoman Gabbard.
1047	TAPPER	Congresswoman Gabbard, you took issue with Senator Harris confronting Vice President Biden at the last debate.
1048	TAPPER	You called it a quote, false accusation that Joe Biden is a racist.
1049	TAPPER	What's your response?
1050	GABBARD	I want to bring the conversation back to the broken criminal justice system that is disproportionately negatively impacting black and brown people all across this country today.
1051	GABBARD	Now Senator Harris says she's proud of her record as a prosecutor and that she'll be a prosecutor president.
1052	GABBARD	But I'm deeply concerned about this record.
1053	GABBARD	There are too many examples to cite but she put over 1,500 people in jail for marijuana violations and then laughed about it when she was asked if she ever smoked marijuana.
1054	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1055	GABBARD	She blocked evidence  she blocked evidence that would have freed an innocent man from death row until the courts forced her to do so.
1056	GABBARD	She kept people in prison beyond their sentences to use them as cheap labor for the state of California.
1057	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1058	GABBARD	And she fought to keep ...
1059	TAPPER	Thank you, Congresswoman.
1060	GABBARD	Bail system in place that impacts poor people in the worst kind of way.
1061	TAPPER	Thank you, Congresswoman.
1062	TAPPER	Senator Harris, your response?
1063	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1064	HARRIS	As the elected attorney general of California, I did the work of significantly reforming the criminal justice system of a state of 40 million people, which became a national model for the work that needs to be done.
1065	HARRIS	And I am proud of that work.
1066	HARRIS	And I am proud of making a decision to not just give fancy speeches or be in a legislative body and give speeches on the floor, but actually doing the work of being in the position to use the power that I had to reform a system that is badly in need of reform.
1067	HARRIS	That is why we created initiatives that were about reentering former offenders and getting them counseling.
1068	TAPPER	Thank you.
1069	HARRIS	It is why (ph) and because I know that criminal justice system is so broken ...
1070	TAPPER	Thank you, Senator.
1071	HARRIS	That I am an advocate for what we need to do to not only decriminalize, but legalize marijuana in the United States.
1072	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
1073	TAPPER	Thank you, Senator.
1074	TAPPER	Your time is up.
1075	TAPPER	I want to  I want to bring Congresswoman Gabbard back in.
1076	TAPPER	Your response, please (ph).
1077	GABBARD	The bottom line is, Senator Harris, when you were in a position to make a difference and an impact in these people's lives, you did not.
1078	GABBARD	And worse yet, in the case of those who were on death row, innocent people, you actually blocked evidence from being revealed that would have freed them until you were forced to do so.
1079	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1080	GABBARD	There is no excuse for that and the people who suffered under your reign as prosecutor owe  you owe them an apology.
1081	TAPPER	Senator Harris?
1082	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1083	HARRIS	My entire career I have been opposed  personally opposed to the death penalty and that has never changed.
1084	HARRIS	And I dare anybody who is in a position to make that decision, to face the people I have faced to say I will not seek the death penalty.
1085	HARRIS	That is my background, that is my work.
1086	HARRIS	I am proud of it.
1087	HARRIS	I think you can judge people by when they are under fire and it's not about some fancy opinion on a stage but when they're in the position to actually make a decision, what do they do.
1088	HARRIS	When I was in the position of having to decide whether or not to seek a death penalty on cases I prosecuted, I made a very difficult decision that was not popular to not seek the death penalty.
1089	HARRIS	History shows that and I am proud of those decisions.
1090	LEMON	Senator Harris, thank you very much.
1091	LEMON	Senator Bennet, a question for you.
1092	LEMON	Why are you the best candidate to heal the racial divide that exists in this country today, which has been stoked by the president's racist rhetoric?
1093	BENNET	Yes.
1094	BENNET	First of all, the president's racist rhetoric should be enough grounds for everybody in this country to vote him out of office.
1095	BENNET	That one thing alone should be enough.
1096	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1097	BENNET	Second, Don, I want to answer your question by tagging on the conversation we were just having.
1098	BENNET	This is the fourth debate that we have had and the second time that we have been debating what people did 50 years ago with busing...
1099	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1100	BENNET	... when our schools are as segregated today as they were 50 years ago.
1101	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1102	BENNET	We need a conversation about what's happening now.
1103	BENNET	And when there's a group of kids in this country that don't get preschool through no fault of their own and another group does, equal is not equal.
1104	BENNET	And we've got a group of K12 schools that are good because families can spend a million bucks, and you've got the Detroit public schools that are as segregated as they were.
1105	BENNET	Equal is not equal.
1106	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1107	BENNET	And let me tell you something else, Don.
1108	BENNET	I believe you can draw a straight line from slavery through Jim Crow through the banking and the redlining to the mass incarceration that we were talking about on this stage a few minutes ago.
1109	BENNET	But you know what other line I can draw?
1110	BENNET	Eightyeight percent of the people in our prisons dropped out of high school.
1111	BENNET	Let's fix our school system and maybe we can fix the prison pipeline that we have.
1112	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1113	LEMON	Thank you, Senator Bennet.
1114	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1115	LEMON	Governor Inslee, what's your response?
1116	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1117	LEMON	Governor Inslee, please respond.
1118	INSLEE	You know, I approach this question with humility because I have not experienced what many Americans have.
1119	INSLEE	I've never been a black teenager pulled over in a white neighborhood.
1120	INSLEE	I've never been a woman talked over in a meeting.
1121	INSLEE	I've never been an LGBTQ member subject to a slur.
1122	INSLEE	And so I have believed I have an added responsibility, a double responsibility, to deal with racial disparity.
1123	INSLEE	And we've talked on the way we do it, including ending  ending the school to prison pipeline in my state.
1124	INSLEE	But I want to say this.
1125	INSLEE	And this is a common error that every single senator on this stage, as much as I respect them all  they all have an enormous error which is going to prevent our party from making any progressive progress in the United States, and it is this.
1126	INSLEE	We are all going to work like the dickens to get more Democrats elected to the Senate, right?
1127	INSLEE	We are going to do that.
1128	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1129	INSLEE	And I hope we're going to succeed.
1130	INSLEE	But if we get a majority in the U.S. Senate, because of the position of these senators, not a damn thing is going to get done.
1131	INSLEE	And I'll tell you why.
1132	INSLEE	With all their good intentions  and I know they're very sincere and passionate and I respect them enormously  but because they embraced this antediluvinal (sic) supermajority thing called the filibuster, Mitch McConnell is going to run the U.S. Senate even if we take a majority.
1133	LEMON	Thank you.
1134	INSLEE	We've got to get rid of the filibuster so we can govern the United States.
1135	LEMON	Mister...
1136	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1137	LEMON	Mr. Yang, why are you the best candidate to heal the racial divide in America  your response?
1138	YANG	I spent seven years running a nonprofit that helped create thousands of jobs, including hundreds right here in Detroit, as well as Baltimore, Cleveland, New Orleans.
1139	YANG	And I saw that the racial disparities are much, much worse than I had ever imagined.
1140	YANG	They're even worse still.
1141	YANG	A study just came out that projected the average AfricanAmerican median net worth will be zero by 2053.
1142	YANG	So you have to ask yourself, how is that possible?
1143	YANG	It's possible because we're in the midst of the greatest economic transformation in our history.
1144	YANG	Artificial intelligence is coming.
1145	YANG	It's going to displace hundreds of thousands of call center workers, truck drivers  the most common job in 29 states, including this one.
1146	YANG	And you know who suffers most in a natural disaster?
1147	YANG	It's people of color, people who have lower levels of capital and education and resources.
1148	YANG	So what are we going to do about it?
1149	YANG	We should just go back to the writings of Martin Luther King, who in 1967, his book "Chaos or Community", said "We need a guaranteed minimum income in the United States of America."
1150	YANG	That is the most effective way for us to address racial inequality in a genuine way and give every American a chance in the 21st Century economy.
1151	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1152	LEMON	Mr. Yang, thank you very much.
1153	LEMON	Secretary Castro, after the president's racist tweets attacking Baltimore and Congressman Elijah Cummings, the mayor of Baltimore slammed the tweets and said to the president  and I quote here  "Help us.
1154	LEMON	Send the resources that we need to rebuild America."
1155	LEMON	So what would you do for Baltimore and other cities that need help?
1156	CASTRO	First of all, the president is a racist, and that was just one more example of it.
1157	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1158	CASTRO	We know that, whether it's Baltimore or cities like Detroit, they have  they're tremendously rich in history and culture and also in possibility.
1159	CASTRO	Here's what I would do if I'm president.
1160	CASTRO	Number one, I would invest in tremendous educational opportunity invest in universal preK for three and fouryearolds invest in improving K12 education and also making higher education available to everyone through tuitionfree public state universities, community colleges and job training and certification programs.
1161	CASTRO	I would followup on the work that I did at HUD.
1162	CASTRO	We passed the most sweeping rule to further desegregate our communities in the United States.
1163	CASTRO	This Trump administration set that back.
1164	CASTRO	I would put that back in order.
1165	CASTRO	I would also invest in housing that is affordable, because folks know that the rent is going through the roof.
1166	CASTRO	And we need to make sure that you don't have to get out of West Baltimore, or Inner City Detroit, or the west side of San Antonio, or anywhere, if you want to reach your American dream.
1167	CASTRO	I want you to be able to accomplish it in your great neighborhood where you are.
1168	LEMON	Thank you, Secretary Castro.
1169	LEMON	Senator Gillibrand, what's your response?
1170	GILLIBRAND	So I don't believe that it's the responsibility of Cory and Kamala to be the only voice that takes on these issues of institutional racism, systemic racism in our country.
1171	GILLIBRAND	I think as a white woman of privilege, who is a U.S. senator, running for president of the United States, it is also my responsibility to lift up those voices that aren't being listened to.
1172	GILLIBRAND	And I can talk to those white women in the suburbs that voted for Trump and explain to them what white privilege actually is, that when their son is walking down a street with a bag of MMs in his pocket, wearing a hoodie, his whiteness is what protects him from not being shot.
1173	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1174	GILLIBRAND	When his  when her  when their child has a car that breaks down, and he knocks on someone's door for help, and the door opens, and the help is given, it's his whiteness that protects him from being shot.
1175	GILLIBRAND	That is what white privilege in America is today.
1176	GILLIBRAND	And so, my responsibility's to only lift up those stories, but explain to communities across America, like I did in Youngstown, Ohio, to a young mother, that this is all of our responsibilities, and that together we can make our community stronger.
1177	BASH	Thank you, Senator Gillibrand.
1178	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1179	BASH	Let's now turn to the issue of the climate crisis.
1180	BASH	The United Nations says the world needs to cut all carbon emissions by 2050 or risk facing disastrous consequences.
1181	BASH	Governor Inslee, many of your fellow democratic candidates say that climate change is the biggest existential threat facing the country.
1182	BASH	You, though, are calling it the number one priority in your campaign.
1183	BASH	What do you know that the others don't?
1184	INSLEE	Well, I know the firsthand terrific impact of climate change on Americans across the country already.
1185	INSLEE	The family who I saw, with their aluminum home now, just a pile of molten aluminum, they lost everything in the paradise of fires the nonprofit in Davenport that was washed away in the floods.
1186	INSLEE	We have to act now.
1187	INSLEE	Look, climate change is not a singular issue, it is all the issue that we Democrats care about.
1188	INSLEE	It is health.
1189	INSLEE	It is national security.
1190	INSLEE	It is our economy.
1191	INSLEE	And we know this middle ground solutions, like the vice president has proposed, or sort of middling averagesized things, are not going to save us.
1192	INSLEE	Too little, too late is too dangerous.
1193	INSLEE	And we have to have a bold plan, and mine has been called the "gold standard."
1194	INSLEE	Now, we also need to embed environmental justice.
1195	INSLEE	I was in zip code 48217 in the Detroit neighborhood the other day, right next to an oil refinery, where the kids have asthma and they have cancer clusters.
1196	INSLEE	And after talking to these folks, I believe this 
1197	BASH	Thank you 
1198	INSLEE	I believe this it doesn't matter what your zip code is 
1199	BASH	Thank you, Governor.
1200	INSLEE	 it doesn't matter what your color is, you ought to have clear 
1201	BASH	Thank you, Governor.
1202	INSLEE	 air and clear water in America.
1203	INSLEE	That's what I believe.
1204	BASH	Vice President Biden, I'd like to get you to respond.
1205	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1206	BASH	Governor Inslee just said that your plan is middling.
1207	BIDEN	There is no middle ground about my plan.
1208	BIDEN	The fact of the matter is I call for the immediate action to be taken.
1209	BIDEN	First of all, one of the things that  we're responsible for 15 percent of all the pollution in the country.
1210	BIDEN	He's right about how it affects people and it affects neighborhoods, particularly poor neighborhoods
1211	BIDEN	But here's the deal in area, there's also another piece.
1212	BIDEN	Eightyfive percent of it is something I helped negotiate and that is the Paris Climate Accord.
1213	BIDEN	I would immediately rejoin that Paris Accord.
1214	BIDEN	I would make sure that we up the ante which it calls for.
1215	BIDEN	I would be able to bring those leaders together who I know I  I convene (ph) them in the White House, like we did in nuclear summit, and I would raise the standard.
1216	BASH	Thank you, Mr. Vice President
1217	BIDEN	I also invested $400 billion 
1218	BASH	Thank you, sir.
1219	BIDEN	 in research for new alternatives to deal with climate change.
1220	BASH	Mr. Yang, your response?
1221	BIDEN	And that's bigger than any other person.
1222	YANG	The important number in Vice President Biden's remarks just now is that he United States was only 15 percent of global emissions.
1223	YANG	We like to act as if we're 100 percent, but the truth is even if we were to curb our emissions dramatically, the earth is still going to get warmer.
1224	YANG	And we can see it around it us this summer.
1225	YANG	The last four years have been the four warmest years in recorded history.
1226	YANG	This is going to be a tough truth, but we are too late.
1227	YANG	We are 10 years too late.
1228	YANG	We need to do everything we can to start moving the climate in the right direction, but we also need to start moving our people to higher ground.
1229	YANG	And the best way to do that is to put economic resources into your hands so you can protect yourself and your families.
1230	INSLEE	I was challenged by the vice president.
1231	BASH	Thank you, Senator.
1232	INSLEE	May I be heard on this for a moment?
1233	BASH	Go ahead, Governor.
1234	INSLEE	Thank you very much.
1235	INSLEE	Look, we have  these deadlines are set by science.
1236	INSLEE	Mr. Vice President, your argument is not with me, it's with science.
1237	INSLEE	And unfortunately, your plan is just too late.
1238	INSLEE	The science tells us we have to get off coal in 10 years.
1239	INSLEE	Your plan does not do that.
1240	INSLEE	We have to have off of fossil fuels in our electrical grid in 15.
1241	INSLEE	Your plan simply does not do that.
1242	INSLEE	I've heard you say that we need a realistic plan.
1243	INSLEE	Here's what I believe...
1244	BIDEN	No, I didn't say that.
1245	INSLEE	Here's what I believe.
1246	INSLEE	I believe that survival is realistic, and that's the kind of plan we need.
1247	INSLEE	And that's the kind I have.
1248	BIDEN	My plan calls for 500,000 charging stations around the country so by 2030 we're all electric vehicles.
1249	BIDEN	My plan calls for making sure that we have $400 billion invested in technologies to learn how to contain what we're doing, creating 10 million new jobs.
1250	BIDEN	We will double offshore wind.
1251	BIDEN	We will end any subsidies for coal or any other fossil fuel.
1252	BIDEN	But we have to also engage the world while we're doing it.
1253	BIDEN	We have to walk and chew gum at the same time.
1254	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1255	BASH	Thank you, Mr. Vice President.
1256	BASH	Just to clarify, would there be any place for fossil fuels, including coal and fracking, in a Biden administration?
1257	BIDEN	No, we would  we would work it out.
1258	BIDEN	We would make sure it's eliminated and no more subsidies for either one of those, either  any fossil fuel.
1259	INSLEE	We can't...
1260	BASH	Thank you, sir.
1261	INSLEE	We cannot work it out.
1262	INSLEE	We cannot work this out.
1263	INSLEE	The time is up.
1264	INSLEE	Our house is on fire.
1265	INSLEE	We have to stop using coal in 10 years, and we need a president to do it or it won't get done.
1266	INSLEE	Get off coal.
1267	INSLEE	Save this country and the planet.
1268	INSLEE	That's what I'm for.
1269	BASH	Senator Harris, your response?
1270	HARRIS	I mean, I have to agree with Governor Inslee.
1271	HARRIS	And I'm going to just paraphrase one of your great sayings, Governor, which is we currently have a president in the White House who obviously does not understand the science.
1272	HARRIS	He's been pushing science fiction instead of science fact.
1273	HARRIS	The guy thinks that wind turbines cause cancer, but what in fact they cause is jobs.
1274	HARRIS	And the reality is that I would take any Democrat on this stage over the current president of the United States, who is rolling it back to our collective peril.
1275	HARRIS	We must have and adopt a Green New Deal.
1276	HARRIS	On day one as president...
1277	BASH	Thank you.
1278	HARRIS	...
1279	HARRIS	I would reenter us in the Paris agreement.
1280	BASH	Thank you, Senator.
1281	HARRIS	And put in place so we would be carbon neutral by 2030.
1282	BASH	Thank you, Senator.
1283	BASH	I want to talk about that with Senator Gillibrand.
1284	BASH	You're a cosponsor of the Green New Deal, which includes the guarantee of a job with medical leave, paid vacations, and retirement security for everyone in America.
1285	BASH	Explain how that's realistic.
1286	GILLIBRAND	So the first thing that I'm going to do when I'm president is I'm going to Clorox the Oval Office.
1287	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1288	GILLIBRAND	The second thing I'm going to do is I will reengage on global climate change.
1289	GILLIBRAND	And I will not only sign the Paris global climate accords, but I will lead a worldwide conversation about the urgency of this crisis.
1290	GILLIBRAND	The greatest threat to humanity is global climate change.
1291	GILLIBRAND	I visited a family in Iowa who  water spewed into her home, Fran Parr, it tossed her refrigerator upend, all the furniture was broken, all the dishes were broken, and mud was everywhere.
1292	GILLIBRAND	That is the impact of severe weather right now on families' lives.
1293	GILLIBRAND	And so the truth is, we need a robust solution.
1294	GILLIBRAND	When John F. Kennedy said I want to put a man on the moon in the next 10 years, not because it's easy, but because it's hard, he knew it was going to be a measure of our innovation, our success, our ability to galvanize worldwide competition.
1295	GILLIBRAND	He wanted to have a space race with Russia.
1296	GILLIBRAND	Why not have a green energy race with China?
1297	GILLIBRAND	Why not have clean air and clean water for all Americans?
1298	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1299	GILLIBRAND	Why not rebuild our infrastructure?
1300	GILLIBRAND	Why not actually invest in the green jobs?
1301	GILLIBRAND	That's what the Green New Deal is about.
1302	BASH	Thank you.
1303	GILLIBRAND	Not only will I pass it, but I will put a price on carbon to make market forces help us.
1304	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1305	BASH	Thank you, Senator.
1306	BASH	Congresswoman Gabbard, you are not a cosponsor of the Green New Deal.
1307	BASH	Please respond.
1308	GABBARD	Well, first of all, this is personal.
1309	GABBARD	If you can imagine, I grew up in Hawaii, which is the most remote island chain in the world.
1310	GABBARD	So for us growing up there, protecting our environment was not a political issue, it's a way of life.
1311	GABBARD	It's part of our culture.
1312	GABBARD	It's part of who we are.
1313	GABBARD	This is why, as a member of Congress, long before there was ever a Green New Deal, I introduced the most ambitious climate change legislation ever in Congress called the Off Fossil Fuels Act.
1314	GABBARD	That actually laid out an actionable plan to take us from where we are today to transition off of fossil fuels and invest in green renewable energy, invest in workforce training, invest in the kinds of infrastructure that we need to deal with the problems and the challenges that climate is posing to us today.
1315	BASH	Thank you, Congresswoman.
1316	BASH	Senator Booker, what's your response?
1317	BASH	Is the job guarantee in the Green New Deal realistic?
1318	BOOKER	I just want to take, first of all, a step back and say that I agree wholeheartedly with Governor Inslee.
1319	BOOKER	It's one of the reasons why Greenpeace ranks me and him at the top of this entire field of the candidates on climate.
1320	INSLEE	Second, Cory.
1321	INSLEE	Second, but close.
1322	INSLEE	You're just close.
1323	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
1324	BOOKER	I'm  hey, hey.
1325	BOOKER	I want to say very clearly  thank you, man.
1326	BOOKER	Thank you.
1327	BOOKER	I'll try harder.
1328	BOOKER	Look, the reason why is because, first of all, this problem didn't start yesterday.
1329	BOOKER	Science didn't become a reality yesterday.
1330	BOOKER	This has been going on for years.
1331	BOOKER	There was another president that would not join an international accord.
1332	BOOKER	Then it was the Kyoto accords.
1333	BOOKER	I was mayor then.
1334	BOOKER	And I stood up in national leadership joining with other mayors to say climate change is not a separate issue.
1335	BOOKER	It must be the issue and the lens with which we view every issue.
1336	BOOKER	Nobody should get applause for rejoining the Paris climate accords.
1337	BOOKER	That is kindergarten.
1338	BOOKER	We have to go to far advances and make sure that everything from our trade deals, everything from the billions of dollars we spend to foreign aid, everything must be sublimated to the challenge and the crisis that is existential, which is dealing with the climate threat.
1339	BOOKER	And, yes, the majority of this problem is outside the United States, but the only way we're going to deal with this is if the United States leads.
1340	BASH	Thank you.
1341	BASH	Thank you, Senator.
1342	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1343	BASH	Mayor de Blasio, your administration has come under fire after hundreds of children living in New York City public housing tested positive for elevated levels of lead.
1344	BASH	As you know, we're not far from Flint, Michigan, where residents are still dealing with the consequences of having lead in their drinking water.
1345	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1346	BASH	How can you assure the people of Flint and across the nation that you are the right person to handle such a problem?
1347	DE BLASIO	We have a huge problem, and it's decades old in New York.
1348	DE BLASIO	But here's what we've done about it.
1349	DE BLASIO	We've declared the eradication of all lead, literally ending the notion of lead poisoning once and all as the goal of our administration, and we're doing something about it.
1350	DE BLASIO	Lead poisoning has gone down 90 percent since 2005, and we're going to literally bring it down to zero, because we're going to go into every place, buildings, schools, public housing, and take out that lead, remediate that lead once and for all, and that needs to be done all over this country.
1351	DE BLASIO	Now, the federal government used to not take any responsibility for our public housing.
1352	DE BLASIO	For decades they've been disinvesting in the public housing that was supposed to be a federal responsibility.
1353	DE BLASIO	That's part of why we have this lead crisis to begin with.
1354	DE BLASIO	But I'll tell you what you do when you're actually in charge of something.
1355	DE BLASIO	I'm in charge of the largest city in this nation.
1356	DE BLASIO	You do not accept the status quo.
1357	DE BLASIO	You fix it.
1358	DE BLASIO	And so we are going into every one of those apartments to make sure those children and those families are safe, and then we are going to eradicate that lead once and for all.
1359	DE BLASIO	And there should be a federal mandate to do the same for Flint, for Detroit, for every place in this country.
1360	BASH	Thank you, Mr. Mayor.
1361	DE BLASIO	It can be done.
1362	BASH	Thank you, Mr. Mayor.
1363	BASH	Secretary Castro, why are you the right candidate to solve this problem?
1364	BASH	Please respond.
1365	CASTRO	Well, because people don't have to wonder what I would do I've actually done it.
1366	CASTRO	I was secretary of housing and urban development when Flint had its water crisis.
1367	CASTRO	I went to Flint.
1368	CASTRO	We did what we could to help folks get water filters.
1369	CASTRO	And then we didn't stop there.
1370	CASTRO	We improved the standard of how we deal with elevated blood lead levels in children.
1371	CASTRO	A lot of Americans don't know that this is still a major problem out there.
1372	CASTRO	I was back in Flint about six weeks ago, and I released a plan to invest $50 billion so that we remove lead as a major public health threat.
1373	CASTRO	We need to do it.
1374	CASTRO	We can do it.
1375	CASTRO	And I will do it if I'm president.
1376	TAPPER	Thank you, Secretary Castro.
1377	(UNKNOWN)	May I get in on this?
1378	TAPPER	Donald Trump won independents here in Michigan by 16 percentage points, which was critical to Donald Trump winning the state's 16 electoral votes.
1379	TAPPER	Now there is a big debate within the Democratic Party here and around the country about the best way the Democrats can win back Michigan.
1380	TAPPER	Vice President Biden, last night on this stage, Senator Elizabeth Warren said, quote, "We're not going to solve the urgent problems that we face with small ideas and spinelessness.
1381	TAPPER	We're going to solve them by being the Democratic Party of big, structural change."
1382	TAPPER	What do you say to progressives who worry that your proposals are not ambitious enough to energize the progressive wing of your party, which you will need to beat Donald Trump?
1383	BIDEN	Because we did it.
1384	BIDEN	I was asked to manage an $87 billion plan that would be spent in a total of 18 months that revived this state and many others, because  and it kept us out of a depression, with 0.2% of waste or fraud.
1385	BIDEN	Secondly, I was part of the organization  and within our administration  that pushed bailing General Motors out, saving tens of thousands of jobs here in this state.
1386	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1387	BIDEN	Number three, number three, I also was asked, as the mayor of Detroit can tell you, by the president of the United States to help Detroit get out of bankruptcy and get back on its feet.
1388	BIDEN	I spent better part of two years out here working to make sure that it did exactly that.
1389	BIDEN	We invested significantly in this city when transportation, only  anyway, the point is we've made significant investment in this state.
1390	BIDEN	I expect in this city  I suspect that's why the mayor endorsed me.
1391	TAPPER	Thank you, Vice President Biden.
1392	TAPPER	Senator Gillibrand, what's your response?
1393	GILLIBRAND	To the people of Michigan, I know exactly how I'd beat President Trump.
1394	GILLIBRAND	I've already done it.
1395	GILLIBRAND	I took a bus tour to talk about Trump's broken promises here in Michigan.
1396	GILLIBRAND	He promised no bad trade deals.
1397	GILLIBRAND	Not only did he not have bad trade deals, he started a trade war with China and he just signed on to another bad trade agreement with NAFTA 2.0, give away to drug companies in Mexico.
1398	GILLIBRAND	I took the bus to Michigan, to Ohio, and to Pennsylvania telling people that he has broken his promises to them.
1399	GILLIBRAND	I lifted up their voices, I listened to their concerns and I offered real solutions.
1400	GILLIBRAND	And I've done this before.
1401	GILLIBRAND	My first House district I ran in was a two to one republican district.
1402	GILLIBRAND	I won it twice and I haven't lost an election since.
1403	TAPPER	Thank you.
1404	GILLIBRAND	And I haven't lost an election since.
1405	GILLIBRAND	So I can bring people together in red, purple, and blue areas.
1406	GILLIBRAND	But more than that, I can get things done.
1407	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
1408	TAPPER	Thank you, Senator Gillibrand.
1409	TAPPER	Mr. Yang, in poll after poll democratic voters are saying that having a nominee who can beat President Trump is more important to them than having a nominee who agrees with them on major issues.
1410	TAPPER	And right now, according to polls, they say the candidate who has the best chance of doing that, of beating President Trump is Vice President Biden.
1411	TAPPER	Why are they wrong?
1412	YANG	Well, I'm building a coalition of disaffected Trump voters, independents, libertarians, and conservatives, as well as democrats and progressives.
1413	YANG	I believe I'm the candidate best suited to beat Donald Trump and as for how to win in Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania, the problem is that so many people feel like the economy has left them behind.
1414	YANG	What we have to do is we have to say look, there's record high GDP in stock market prices, you know what else they're at record high is?
1415	YANG	Suicides, drug overdoses, depression, anxiety.
1416	YANG	It's gotten so bad that American life expectancy had declined for the last three years.
1417	YANG	And I like to talk about my wife who is at home with our two boys right now, one of whom is autistic.
1418	YANG	What is her work count at in today's economy.
1419	YANG	Zero and we know that's the opposite of the truth.
1420	YANG	We know that her work is amongst the most challenging and vital.
1421	YANG	The way we win this election as we redefine economic progress to include all the things that matter to the people in Michigan and all of us like our own heath, our well being, our mental health, our clean air and clean water, how are kids are doing.
1422	YANG	If we change the measurements for the 21st century economy to revolve around our own well being then we will win this election.
1423	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
1424	TAPPER	Thank you, Mr. Yang.
1425	TAPPER	Congresswoman Gabbard, your response?
1426	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1427	GABBARD	Donald Trump won this election because far too many people in this country felt like they'd been left behind by both political parties, by self serving politicians on both sides who are more interested in partisan politics than they are in actually fighting for the people.
1428	GABBARD	I'm speaking the truth to people all across this country about the fact that people in Flint, Michigan are still being left behind, still being poisoned by the water in their system because every single month we are spending $4 billion on a continuing war in Afghanistan, $4 billion every single month rather than ending that war, bringing our troops home, and using those precious resources into serving the needs of the people here in this country.
1429	GABBARD	People, communities ...
1430	TAPPER	Thank you, Congresswoman.
1431	GABBARD	That's the kind of leadership that I'll bring.
1432	TAPPER	Thank you, Congresswoman.
1433	TAPPER	Senator Booker, your response.
1434	BOOKER	I  I'm grateful  I'm grateful.
1435	BOOKER	Jake look, this is one of those times where we're not staring at the truth and calling it out.
1436	BOOKER	And  and this is a case for the Democratic Party, the truth will set us free.
1437	BOOKER	We lost the state of Michigan because everybody from republicans to Russians were targeting the suppression of African American voters.
1438	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1439	BOOKER	We need to say that.
1440	BOOKER	If the African American vote in this state had been like it was four years earlier, we would have won the state of Michigan.
1441	BOOKER	We need to have a campaign that is ready for what's coming.
1442	BOOKER	And all out of salt especially on the most valuable voter group in our  in fact, the highest performing voter group in our coalition, which is black women.
1443	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1444	BOOKER	And so I will be a person that tries to fight against voter suppression and to activate and engage the kind of voters and coalitions who are going to win states like Michigan and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
1445	TAPPER	Thank you.
1446	TAPPER	Senator Harris?
1447	HARRIS	First of all, Donald Trump came in making a whole lot of promises to working people that he did not keep.
1448	HARRIS	He said he was going to help farmers.
1449	HARRIS	He said he was going to help auto workers.
1450	HARRIS	Farmers are now looking at bankruptcy, soy beans rotting in bills.
1451	HARRIS	Auto workers we expect perhaps hundreds of thousands will be out of jobs by the end of the year.
1452	HARRIS	Jerome Powell just dropped the interest rates and he admitted why.
1453	HARRIS	Because of this so called trade policy that this president has that has been nothing more than the Trump trade tax that has resulted in American families spending as much as $1.4 billion more on everything from shampoo to washing machines.
1454	HARRIS	He betrayed the American people, he betrayed American families, and he will lose this election because folks are clear ...
1455	TAPPER	Thank you.
1456	HARRIS	 that he has done nothing except try to beat people down instead of lift people up.
1457	HARRIS	And that's what we want in the next president of the United States.
1458	TAPPER	Thank you, Senator Harris.
1459	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1460	TAPPER	The debate is back, right after this short break.
1461	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1462	SYSTEM	(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
1463	TAPPER	We're back with the CNN Democratic presidential debate.
1464	TAPPER	We want to turn now to the economy.
1465	TAPPER	Secretary Castro, this is for you.
1466	TAPPER	Wage growth is up.
1467	TAPPER	Stocks are rising.
1468	TAPPER	Unemployment is near historic lows, including for Latinos and AfricanAmericans.
1469	TAPPER	You have all outlined plans, but you in particular, that could end up raising taxes.
1470	TAPPER	How can you guarantee that won't hurt the economy?
1471	CASTRO	Well, first of all, there are a lot of Americans right now that are hurting.
1472	CASTRO	Just go and ask the folks that just received notice that they're getting laid off by General Motors, or ask the many folks who are sleeping on the streets in big cities and small towns across the United States, or ask fast food workers that I joined a couple of weeks ago that are working for minimum wage and can't provide for their families or pay the rent.
1473	CASTRO	So the idea that America is doing just fine is wrong.
1474	CASTRO	Not only that, this president always likes to take credit, like he did this.
1475	CASTRO	We have now had about 105 straight months of positive job growth, the longest streak in American history.
1476	CASTRO	Over 80 months of that was due to President Barack Obama.
1477	CASTRO	Thank you, Barack Obama.
1478	CASTRO	Thank you, Barack Obama.
1479	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1480	CASTRO	So, you know, I believe that we need to invest in what will ensure that Americans can prosper in the years to come, making sure they have the knowledge and skills to compete in the 21st century economy, ensuring that they can afford the rent where they live and that they have health care so that they don't have to worry about going homeless because they can't afford a medical procedure.
1481	BASH	Thank you, Secretary Castro.
1482	BASH	I want to turn now to a question about trade and for Congresswoman Gabbard.
1483	BASH	Many saw the TransPacific Partnership issue as something that would be a critical tool to deal with the rise of China.
1484	BASH	You were against it.
1485	BASH	How would you ensure that the United States is able to remain competitive against China on the world stage?
1486	GABBARD	By pushing for fair trade, not trade deals that give away the sovereignty of the American people and our country, that give away American jobs, and that threaten our environment.
1487	GABBARD	These are the three main issues with that massive trade deal, the TransPacific Partnership.
1488	GABBARD	I think the central one was the fact that it gave away our sovereignty to a panel of international corporations whose rulings would supersede any domestic law that we would pass, either a federal law or a state or a local law.
1489	GABBARD	This is extremely dangerous and goes against the very values that we have as a country.
1490	GABBARD	What to speak of the fact that it would have a negative impact on domestic jobs and that it lacked clear protections for our environment.
1491	GABBARD	These are the things that we have to keep at the forefront as we look to enact fair trade deals with other countries to make sure that we continue to be a thriving part of our global economy.
1492	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1493	BASH	So to be clear, Congresswoman, would you keep President Trump's tariffs on China in place?
1494	GABBARD	I would not, because the approach that President Trump has taken has been extremely volatile without any clear strategic plan, and it has a ravaging and devastating effect on our domestic manufacturers, on our farmers, who are already struggling and now failing to see the light of day because of the plan that Trump has taken.
1495	BASH	Vice President Biden, would you rejoin the TransPacific Partnership, which, of course, President Trump withdrew from?
1496	BASH	Please respond.
1497	BIDEN	I'd renegotiate.
1498	BIDEN	We make up 25 percent of the world's economy.
1499	BIDEN	In order  either China is going to write the rules of the road for the 21st century on trade or we are.
1500	BIDEN	We have to join with the 40 percent of the world that we had with us, and this time make sure that there's no one sitting at that table doing the deal unless environmentalists are there and labor is there.
1501	BIDEN	And to make sure we equip our workers first to compete by investing in them now, in the things that make them more competitive.
1502	BIDEN	That's what we have to do.
1503	BIDEN	Otherwise, they are going to write the rules of the road.
1504	BIDEN	We must have the rest of the world join us to keep them in check from abusing.
1505	BASH	Thank you.
1506	BASH	Thank you.
1507	BASH	Vice President Biden, just to be clear, would you or would you not rejoin the TPP, yes or no?
1508	BIDEN	I would not rejoin the TPP as it was initially put forward.
1509	BIDEN	I would insist that we renegotiate pieces of that with the Pacific nations that we had in South America and North America, so that we could bring them together to hold China accountable for the rules of us setting the rules of the road as to how trade should be conducted.
1510	BIDEN	Otherwise, they're going to do exactly what they're doing, fill the vacuum and run the  and run the table.
1511	BASH	Thank you, sir.
1512	BASH	Mayor de Blasio, you also oppose the deal.
1513	BASH	Please respond.
1514	DE BLASIO	Yeah, and I just want to ask this question of all the candidates, but particularly of Vice President Biden.
1515	DE BLASIO	President Trump is trying to sell NAFTA 2.0.
1516	DE BLASIO	He's got a new name for it.
1517	DE BLASIO	It's just as dangerous as the old NAFTA.
1518	DE BLASIO	It's going to take away American jobs like the old NAFTA, like it did to Michigan.
1519	DE BLASIO	And we cannot have Democrats be party to a new NAFTA.
1520	DE BLASIO	So, Vice President, I believe you're the only person on the stage who voted for the original NAFTA.
1521	DE BLASIO	Are you ready to say here and now that you will oppose a new NAFTA and that what you will believe in, which is a lot of us hope for, is trade treaties that empower organized labor across the boundaries of the world and give working people power again, not just multinational corporations.
1522	BASH	Mr. Vice President?
1523	BIDEN	Yes.
1524	BASH	Your response?
1525	BASH	Your response, sir?
1526	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
1527	BIDEN	Yes.
1528	BASH	That's it?
1529	BIDEN	No, he said, would I insist that labor be engaged?
1530	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1531	BIDEN	The answer is yes.
1532	DE BLASIO	I consider that a victory.
1533	BIDEN	Well, I love your affection for me.
1534	BIDEN	You spend a lot of time with me.
1535	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1536	DE BLASIO	You know what?
1537	DE BLASIO	We believe in redemption, Joe.
1538	DE BLASIO	We believe in redemption in this party.
1539	BIDEN	Well, I tell you what, I hope you're part of it.
1540	BASH	OK, I'm going to ask a question of Senator Bennet now.
1541	BASH	Senator, CNN reached out to Michigan Democratic primary voters for their most pressing question.
1542	BASH	Farris from Flint, Michigan, has this question "Here in Detroit, our economy has seen firsthand how technology and automation can displace workers and create uncertainty around human job security.
1543	BASH	How would you balance these disruptions created by technology with the beneficial impact of technology on our economy?
1544	BENNET	Dana, this goes to the last question you asked, as well, which is, how are we going to remain competitive?
1545	BENNET	It's not just about trade, which we were talking about earlier.
1546	BENNET	It's about whether we're going to invest in this country anymore.
1547	BENNET	Since 2001, we have cut $5 trillion worth of taxes.
1548	BENNET	Almost all of that has gone to the wealthiest people in America.
1549	BENNET	We have made the income inequality worse, not better, through the policies of the federal government.
1550	BENNET	We've spent $5.6 trillion in the Middle East.
1551	BENNET	That's $12 trillion or $13 trillion that from the point of view of driving the economy in Michigan, or anywhere else in America, we might as well just have lit that money on fire.
1552	BENNET	We've got to stop doing that.
1553	BENNET	And we need to invest in America again.
1554	BENNET	For the money that we've spent that I just described, we could have fixed every road and bridge in this country.
1555	BENNET	We could have fixed every airport that needs to be fixed.
1556	BENNET	We could have fixed not just Flint, but every water system in this country.
1557	BASH	Thank you.
1558	BENNET	We could have made Social Security solvent for my children.
1559	BASH	Thank you, Senator.
1560	BENNET	But we did none of it because of selfserving politicians in Washington, D.C., who voted for deals that were good for them but not for Michigan or the American people.
1561	BASH	Senator Bennet, thank you very much.
1562	BASH	Your time is up, sir.
1563	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1564	BENNET	Thank you.
1565	BASH	Mr. Yang, Mr. Yang, women on average earn 80 cents, about 80 cents for every dollar earned by men.
1566	BASH	Senator Harris wants to fine companies that don't close their gender pay gaps.
1567	BASH	As an entrepreneur, do you think a stiff fine will change how companies pay their female employees?
1568	YANG	I have seen firsthand the inequities in the business world where women are concerned, particularly in startups and entrepreneurship.
1569	YANG	We have to do more at every step.
1570	YANG	And if you're a woman entrepreneur, the obstacles start not just at home, but then when you seek a mentor or an investor, often they don't look like you and they might not think your idea is the right one.
1571	YANG	In order to give women a leg up, what we have to do is we have to think about women in every situation, including the ones who are in exploitive and abusive jobs and relationships around the country.
1572	YANG	I'm talking about the waitress who's getting harassed by her boss at the diner who might have a business idea, but right now is stuck where she is.
1573	YANG	What we have to do is we have to give women the economic freedom to be able to improve their own situations and start businesses, and the best way to do this is by putting a dividend of $1,000 a month into their hands.
1574	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1575	YANG	It would be a gamechanger for women around the country, because we know that women do more of the unrecognized and uncompensated work in our society.
1576	YANG	It will not change unless we change it.
1577	YANG	And I say that's just what we do.
1578	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1579	BASH	Senator Harris, your response?
1580	HARRIS	I think that's support of my proposal, which is this.
1581	HARRIS	Since 1963, when we passed the Equal Pay Act, we have been talking about the fact women are not paid equally for equal work.
1582	HARRIS	Fast forward to the year of our lord 2019, and women are paid 80 cents on the dollar, black women 61 cents, Native American woman 58 cents, Latinas 53 cents.
1583	HARRIS	I'm done with the conversation.
1584	HARRIS	So, yes, I am proposing in order to deal with this, one, I'm going to require corporations to post on their website whether they are paying women equally for equal work.
1585	HARRIS	Two, they will be fined for every 1 percent differential between what they're paying men and women, they will be fined 1 percent of their previous year's profit.
1586	HARRIS	That will get everybody's attention.
1587	BASH	Thank you, Senator.
1588	HARRIS	Time for action.
1589	BASH	Senator Gillibrand, what's your response?
1590	BASH	Will fining companies help solve the problem?
1591	GILLIBRAND	I think we have to have a broader conversation about whether we value women and whether we want to make sure women have every opportunity in the workplace.
1592	GILLIBRAND	And I want to address Vice President Biden directly.
1593	GILLIBRAND	When the Senate was debating middleclass affordability for childcare, he wrote an oped.
1594	GILLIBRAND	He voted against it, the only vote, but what he wrote in an oped was that he believed that women working outside the home would, quote, "create the deterioration of family."
1595	GILLIBRAND	He also said that women who were working outside the home were, quote, "avoiding responsibility."
1596	GILLIBRAND	And I just need to understand as a woman who's worked my entire career as the primary wage earner, as the primary caregiver, in fact, the second  my second son, Henry, is here, and I had him when I was a member of Congress.
1597	GILLIBRAND	So under Vice President Biden's analysis, am I serving in Congress resulting in the deterioration of the family, because I had access to quality affordable day care?
1598	GILLIBRAND	I just want to know what he meant when he said that.
1599	BIDEN	That was a long time ago, and here's what it was about.
1600	BIDEN	It would have given people making today $100,000 a year a tax break for childcare.
1601	BIDEN	I did not want that.
1602	BIDEN	I wanted the childcare to go to people making less than $100,000.
1603	BIDEN	And that's what it was about.
1604	BIDEN	As a single father who in fact raised three children for five years by myself, I have some idea what it cost.
1605	BIDEN	I support making sure that every single solitary person needing childcare get an $8,000 tax credit now.
1606	BIDEN	That would put 700,000 women back to work, increase the GDP by almost 810 of 1 percent.
1607	BIDEN	It's the right thing to do if we can give tax breaks to corporations for these things, why can't we do it this way?
1608	GILLIBRAND	But Mr. Vice President, you didn't answer my question.
1609	GILLIBRAND	What did you mean when you said when a woman works outside the home it's resulting in quote, the deterioration of family ...
1610	BIDEN	No, what I ...
1611	GILLIBRAND	And that we are voiding  these are quotes.
1612	GILLIBRAND	It was the title of the oped and that just causes concern for me because we know America's women are working.
1613	GILLIBRAND	4 out of 10 moms have to work.
1614	GILLIBRAND	They're the primary or sole wagers.
1615	GILLIBRAND	They actually have to put food on the table.
1616	GILLIBRAND	8 out of 10 moms are working today.
1617	GILLIBRAND	Most women have to work to provide for their kids.
1618	GILLIBRAND	Many women want to be working to provide for their communities and to help people.
1619	BASH	Thank you, Senator.
1620	BASH	Let the vice president respond now, thank you.
1621	GILLIBRAND	So either you don't believe it today or what did you mean when you said it then?
1622	BIDEN	The very beginning my deceased wife worked when we had children.
1623	BIDEN	My present wife has worked all the way through raising our children.
1624	BIDEN	The fact of the matter is the situation is one that I don't know what's happened.
1625	BIDEN	I wrote the Violence against Women Act.
1626	BIDEN	Lilly Ledbetter.
1627	BIDEN	I was deeply involved in making sure the equal pay amendments.
1628	BIDEN	I was deeply involved on all these things.
1629	BIDEN	I came up with the it's on us proposal to see to it that women were treated more decently on college campuses.
1630	BIDEN	You came to Syracuse University with me and said it was wonderful.
1631	BIDEN	I'm passionate about the concern making sure women are treated equally.
1632	BIDEN	I don't know what's happened except that you're now running for president.
1633	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1634	GILLIBRAND	So I understand  Mr. Vice President  Mr. Vice President, I respect you deeply.
1635	GILLIBRAND	I respect you deeply but those words are very specific.
1636	GILLIBRAND	You said women working outside the home would lead to the deterioration of family.
1637	GILLIBRAND	My grandmother worked outside the home.
1638	GILLIBRAND	My  my mother worked outside the home.
1639	GILLIBRAND	And  and ....
1640	BASH	Thank you, Senator GILLIBRAND.
1641	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
1642	BASH	I want to bring Senator Harris into this conversation.
1643	GILLIBRAND	Either he no longer believes it  I mean I just think he needs to ...
1644	BIDEN	I never believed it.
1645	BASH	Thank you.
1646	BASH	Senator Harris, please respond.
1647	HARRIS	Well, I just  listen, I mean talk about now running for president, you change your position on the Hyde Amendment, Vice President, where you mad a decision for years to withhold resources to poor women to have access to reproductive healthcare and including women who were the victims of rape and incest.
1648	HARRIS	Do you now say that you have evolved and you regret that?
1649	HARRIS	Because you have only, since you've been running for president this time, said that you had  you in some way would take that back or you didn't agree with the decision that you made over many, many years.
1650	HARRIS	And this directly impacted so many women in our country and I personally prosecuted rape cases and child molestation cases and the experience that those women have, those children have and that they would then be denied the resources ...
1651	BASH	Thank you, Senator.
1652	BASH	Let the Vice President ...
1653	HARRIS	I think is  is unacceptable.
1654	BIDEN	The fact is that the senator knows that that's not position.
1655	BIDEN	Everybody on this stage has been in the Congress and the Senate or House has voted for the Hyde Amendment at some point.
1656	BIDEN	The Hyde Amendment in the past was available because there was other access for those kinds of services provided privately.
1657	BIDEN	But once I wrote the legislation, making sure that every single woman would in fact be (ph) have an opportunity to have healthcare paid for by the federal government, everyone that  that could no longer stand.
1658	BIDEN	I support a woman's right to choose.
1659	BIDEN	I support it's a constitutional right.
1660	BIDEN	I've supported it and I will continue to support it and I will, in fact, move as president to see to it that the Congress legislates that that is the laws as well.
1661	BASH	Thank you  thank you, Mr. Vice President.
1662	BASH	Governor Inslee, your response.
1663	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
1664	HARRIS	Well why did it take you so long to change your position in the Hyde Amendment.
1665	HARRIS	Why did it take so long until you were running for president to change your position on the Hyde?
1666	BIDEN	Because there was not full federal funding for all reproductive services prior to this point.
1667	BASH	OK.
1668	BASH	Thank you.
1669	BASH	Governor Inslee, your response?
1670	INSLEE	I  I would suggest we need to broaden our discussion.
1671	INSLEE	I would suggest we need to think about a bigger scandal in America, which is that in professions and careers where women have been more than the majority, they have been almost always under paid.
1672	INSLEE	And that is why this year I'm proud to be the governor who won the largest pay increase for our educators in the United States.
1673	INSLEE	And I believe that that is long, long overdue.
1674	INSLEE	I think it is true for nursing staff as well.
1675	INSLEE	And I'm glad that we've now passed in measures.
1676	INSLEE	And I'm glad that we've increased our union membership 10 percent ...
1677	TAPPER	Thank you, Governor.
1678	INSLEE	So unions can stand up for women as well.
1679	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
1680	TAPPER	Thank you, Governor Inslee.
1681	TAPPER	I want to turn to foreign policy, if we can.
1682	TAPPER	Senator Booker, there are about 14,000 U.S. services members in Afghanistan right now.
1683	TAPPER	If elected, will they still be in Afghanistan by the end of your first year in office?
1684	BOOKER	Well, first of all, I want to say very clearly that I will not do foreign policy by tweet as Donald Trump seems to do all the time.
1685	BOOKER	A guy that literally tweets out that we're pulling our troops out before his generals even know about it is creating a dangerous situation for our troops in places like Afghanistan.
1686	BOOKER	And so I will bring our troops home and I will bring them home as quickly as possible, but I will not set during a campaign an artificial deadline.
1687	BOOKER	I will make sure we do it, we do it expeditiously, we do it safely, to not create a vacuum that's ultimately going to destabilize the Middle East and perhaps create the environment for terrorism and for extremism to threaten our nation.
1688	TAPPER	Congresswoman Gabbard, you're the only veteran on this stage.
1689	TAPPER	Please respond.
1690	GABBARD	This is real in a way that's very difficult to convey in words.
1691	GABBARD	I was deployed to Iraq in 2005 during the height of the war where I served in a field medical unit where every single day I saw the high cost of war.
1692	GABBARD	Just this past week, two more of our soldiers were killed in Afghanistan.
1693	GABBARD	My cousin is deployed to Afghanistan right now.
1694	GABBARD	Nearly 300 of our Hawaii National Guard soldiers are deployed to Afghanistan, 14,000 servicemembers are deployed there.
1695	GABBARD	This is not about arbitrary deadlines.
1696	GABBARD	This is about leadership, the leadership I will bring to do the right thing to bring our troops home, within the first year in office, because they shouldn't have been there this long.
1697	GABBARD	For too long, we've had leaders who have been arbitrating foreign policy from ivory towers in Washington without any idea about the cost and the consequence, the toll that it takes on our servicemembers, on their families.
1698	GABBARD	We have to do the right thing, end these wasteful regime change wars, and bring our troops home.
1699	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1700	TAPPER	Thank you.
1701	TAPPER	Thank you, Congresswoman.
1702	TAPPER	Mr. Yang, Iran has now breached the terms of the 2015 nuclear deal after President Trump withdrew the U.S. from the deal, and that puts Iran closer to building a nuclear weapon, the ability to do so, at the very least.
1703	TAPPER	You've said if Iran violates the agreement, the U.S. would need to respond, quote, "very strongly."
1704	TAPPER	So how would a President Yang respond right now?
1705	YANG	I would move to deescalate tensions in Iran, because they're responding to the fact that we pulled out of this agreement.
1706	YANG	And it wasn't just us and Iran.
1707	YANG	There were many other world powers that were part of that multinational agreement.
1708	YANG	We'd have to try and reenter that agreement, renegotiate the timelines, because the timelines now don't make as much sense.
1709	YANG	But I've signed a pledge to end the forever wars.
1710	YANG	Right now, our strength abroad reflects our strength at home.
1711	YANG	What's happened, really?
1712	YANG	We've fallen apart at home, so we elected Donald Trump, and now we have this erratic and unpredictable relationship with even our longstanding partners and allies.
1713	YANG	What we have to do is we have to start investing those resources to solve the problems right here at home.
1714	YANG	We've spent trillions of dollars and lost thousands of American lives in conflicts that have had unclear benefits.
1715	YANG	We've been in a constant state of war for 18 years.
1716	YANG	This is not what the American people want.
1717	YANG	I would bring the troops home, I would deescalate tensions with Iran, and I would start investing our resources in our own communities.
1718	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1719	TAPPER	Governor Inslee, your response?
1720	INSLEE	Well, I think that these are matters of great and often difficult judgment.
1721	INSLEE	And there is no sort of primer for presidents to read.
1722	INSLEE	We have to determine whether a potential president has adequate judgment in these decisions.
1723	INSLEE	I was only one of two members on this panel today who were called to make a judgment about the Iraq war.
1724	INSLEE	I was a relatively new member of Congress, and I made the right judgment, because it was obvious to me that George Bush was fanning the flames of war.
1725	INSLEE	Now we face similar situations where we recognize we have a president who would be willing to beat the drums of war.
1726	INSLEE	We need a president who can stand up against the drums of war and make rational decisions.
1727	INSLEE	That was the right vote, and I believe it.
1728	TAPPER	Thank you.
1729	TAPPER	Thank you, Governor.
1730	TAPPER	Vice President Biden, he was obviously suggesting that you made the wrong decision and had bad judgment when you voted to go to war in Iraq as a U.S. senator.
1731	BIDEN	I did make a bad judgment, trusting the president saying he was only doing this to get inspectors in and get the U.N. to agree to put inspectors in.
1732	BIDEN	From the moment "shock and awe" started, from that moment, I was opposed to the effort, and I was outspoken as much as anyone at all in the Congress and the administration.
1733	BIDEN	Secondly, I was asked by the president in the first meeting we had on Iraq, he turned and said, Joe, get our combat troops out, in front of the entire national security team.
1734	BIDEN	One of the proudest moment of my life was to stand there in AlFaw Palace and tell everyone that we're coming  all our combat troops are coming home.
1735	TAPPER	Thank you.
1736	BIDEN	I opposed the surge in Afghanistan, this long overdue  we should have not, in fact, gone into Afghanistan the way...
1737	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
1738	TAPPER	Thank you, Mr. Vice President.
1739	TAPPER	I want to bring in...
1740	INSLEE	Mr. Vice President  I'd like to comment.
1741	TAPPER	I would like to bring in the person on the stage who served in Iraq, Governor  I'm sorry, Congresswoman Gabbard.
1742	TAPPER	Your response to what Vice President Biden just said.
1743	GABBARD	We were all lied to.
1744	GABBARD	This is the betrayal.
1745	GABBARD	This is the betrayal to the American people, to me, to my fellow servicemembers.
1746	GABBARD	We were all lied to, told that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, was working with Al Qaida, and that this posed a threat to the American people.
1747	GABBARD	So I enlisted after 911 to protect our country, to go after those who attacked us on that fateful day, who took the lives of thousands of Americans.
1748	GABBARD	The problem is that this current president is continuing to betray us.
1749	GABBARD	We were supposed to be going after Al Qaida.
1750	GABBARD	But over years now, not only have we not gone after Al Qaida, who is stronger today than they were in 911, our president is supporting Al Qaida.
1751	LEMON	Thank you, Congresswoman.
1752	DE BLASIO	We didn't talk about Iran.
1753	LEMON	Let's talk about  thank you, please.
1754	DE BLASIO	We didn't talk about Iran.
1755	LEMON	Please.
1756	DE BLASIO	We're on the march to war in Iran right now, and we blew by it.
1757	LEMON	Please, Mayor.
1758	LEMON	The rules  please follow the rules.
1759	DE BLASIO	I respect the rules, but we have to stop this march to war in Iran.
1760	LEMON	Mayor, thank you very much.
1761	LEMON	We're going on...
1762	DE BLASIO	And the Democratic Party has to stand up for it.
1763	LEMON	... and we're going to talk about another subject.
1764	LEMON	Mayor, thank you very much.
1765	LEMON	I appreciate that.
1766	LEMON	Let's talk about now the former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's appearance in front of Congress last week.
1767	LEMON	When asked whether or not the president could be charged with a crime after leaving office, his answer was yes.
1768	LEMON	Senator Harris, you have criticized President Trump for interfering with the Justice Department, and just last month you said if you were elected president, your Justice Department would, quote, "have no choice and should go forward with obstruction of justice charges against former President Trump."
1769	LEMON	Why is it OK for you to advocate for the Justice Department to prosecute somebody, but President Trump, not him?
1770	HARRIS	Well, I would never direct the Department of Justice to do whatever it believes it should do.
1771	HARRIS	But, listen, look, we all watched his testimony.
1772	HARRIS	I've read the report.
1773	HARRIS	There are 10 clear incidents of obstruction of justice by this president, and he needs to be held accountable.
1774	HARRIS	I have seen people go to prison for far less.
1775	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1776	HARRIS	And the reality of it is that we have a person in the White House right now who has been shielded by a memo in the United States Department of Justice that says a sitting president cannot be indicted.
1777	HARRIS	I believe the American people are right to say there should be consequence and accountability for everyone and no one is above the law, including the president of the United States.
1778	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1779	LEMON	Senator Booker, your response?
1780	BOOKER	My response is exactly that.
1781	BOOKER	I've read the report.
1782	BOOKER	I've read the redacted versions of the report.
1783	BOOKER	We have something that is astonishing going on in the United States of the America.
1784	BOOKER	We have a president that is not acting like the leader of the free world.
1785	BOOKER	He's acting like an authoritarian against the actual Constitution that he swore an oath to uphold.
1786	BOOKER	And so this is a difference with a lot of us on this debate stage.
1787	BOOKER	I believe that we in the United States Congress should start impeachment proceedings immediately.
1788	BOOKER	And I'll tell you this...
1789	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1790	BOOKER	Debbie Stabenow now has joined my call for starting impeachment proceedings, because he is now stonewalling Congress, not allowing  subjecting himself to the checks and balances.
1791	BOOKER	We swore an oath to uphold the Constitution.
1792	BOOKER	The politics of this be dammed.
1793	BOOKER	When we look back in history at what happened when a president of the United States started acting more like an authoritarian leader than the leader of the free world, the question is, is what will we have done?
1794	BOOKER	And I believe the Congress should do its job.
1795	LEMON	Senator Booker, thank you very much.
1796	LEMON	Secretary Castro, what's your response?
1797	CASTRO	Well, I agree.
1798	CASTRO	I was the first of the candidates to call on Congress to begin impeachment proceedings.
1799	CASTRO	There are 10 different incidents that Robert Mueller has pointed out where this president either obstructed justice or attempted to obstruct justice.
1800	CASTRO	And I believe that they should go forward with impeachment proceedings.
1801	CASTRO	As to the question of what my Department of Justice would do, I agree with those who say that a president should not direct an attorney general specifically to prosecute or not prosecute.
1802	CASTRO	However, I believe that the evidence is plain and clear and that if it gets that far, that you're likely to see a prosecution of Donald Trump.
1803	LEMON	Thank you, Secretary.
1804	LEMON	Mayor de Blasio, I'm going to bring you in.
1805	LEMON	What's your response?
1806	DE BLASIO	I think it's obvious at this point in our history that the president has committed the crimes worthy of impeachment.
1807	DE BLASIO	But I want to caution my fellow Democrats.
1808	DE BLASIO	While we move in every way we can for impeachment, we have to remember at the same time the American people are out there looking for us to do something for them in their lives.
1809	DE BLASIO	And what they see when they turn on the TV or go online is just talk about impeachment.
1810	DE BLASIO	We need more talk about working people and their lives.
1811	DE BLASIO	For example, are we really ready  and I ask people on this stage this question  are we ready to make sure that the wealthy pay their fair share in taxes?
1812	DE BLASIO	That's something every American wants to know about.
1813	DE BLASIO	That's something they want answers to right now.
1814	DE BLASIO	So, yeah, move for impeachment, but don't forget to do the people's business and to stand up for working people, because that's how we're actually going to beat Donald Trump.
1815	DE BLASIO	The best impeachment is beating him in the election of 2020.
1816	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1817	LEMON	Mayor, thank you very much.
1818	LEMON	Senator Bennet, how do you respond to this conversation?
1819	BENNET	I think, look, as we go forward here, we need to recognize a very practical reality, which is that we are four months  we've got the August recess.
1820	BENNET	Then we are four months away from the Iowa Caucuses.
1821	BENNET	And I just want to make sure whatever we do doesn't end up with an acquittal by Mitch McConnell in the Senate, which it surely would.
1822	BENNET	And then President Trump would be running saying that he had been acquitted by the United States Congress.
1823	BENNET	I believe we have a moral obligation to beat Donald Trump.
1824	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1825	BENNET	He has to be a singleterm president.
1826	BENNET	And we can't do anything that plays into our  his hands.
1827	BENNET	We were talking earlier about  about climate up here.
1828	BENNET	It's so important.
1829	BENNET	Donald Trump should be the last climate denier that's ever in the White House.
1830	LEMON	Senator Bennet, thank you very much.
1831	LEMON	Secretary Castro, please respond.
1832	BENNET	But we need to be smart about how we're running or we're going to give him a second term.
1833	BENNET	We can't do it.
1834	LEMON	Secretary, please, your turn.
1835	CASTRO	Well, let me first say that I really do believe that we can walk and chew gum at the same time.
1836	CASTRO	All of us have a vision for the future of the country that we're articulating to the American people.
1837	CASTRO	We're going to continue to do that.
1838	CASTRO	We have an election coming up.
1839	CASTRO	At the same time, Senator, you know, I think that too many folks in the Senate and in the Congress have been spooked by 1998.
1840	CASTRO	I believe that the times are different.
1841	CASTRO	And in fact, I think that folks are making a mistake by not pursuing impeachment.
1842	CASTRO	The Mueller Report clearly details that he deserves it.
1843	CASTRO	And what's going to happen in the fall of next year, of 2020, if they don't impeach him, is he's going to say, "You see?
1844	CASTRO	You see?
1845	CASTRO	The Democrats didn't go after me on impeachment, and you know why?
1846	CASTRO	Because I didn't do anything wrong."
1847	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1848	CASTRO	These folks that always investigate me, they're always trying to go after me.
1849	CASTRO	When it came down to it, they didn't go after me there because I didn't do anything wrong."
1850	CASTRO	Conversely, if Mitch McConnell is the one that lets him off the hook, we're going to be able to say...
1851	LEMON	Secretary...
1852	CASTRO	Well, sure, they impeached him in the House, but his friend, Mitch McConnell, Moscow Mitch, let him off the hook.
1853	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1854	LEMON	Senator Bennet, please respond.
1855	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1856	BENNET	I  I don't disagree with that.
1857	BENNET	You just said it better than I did.
1858	BENNET	We have to walk and chew gum at the same time.
1859	BENNET	It is incredibly unusual for members of Congress to be able to do that.
1860	BENNET	And I'm glad that Secretary Castro has the ambition...
1861	CASTRO	Well, my brother can.
1862	CASTRO	He's here tonight.
1863	BENNET	Ah, that's what I was going to say.
1864	BENNET	It's your brother that's given you that good feeling about the Congress.
1865	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
1866	BENNET	That's what we should do.
1867	LEMON	Thank you, Senator.
1868	LEMON	Thank you, gentlemen.
1869	LEMON	The debate continues, right after this.
1870	TAPPER	Welcome back to the CNN Democratic presidential debate.
1871	TAPPER	It is time now for closing statements.
1872	TAPPER	You will each receive one minute.
1873	TAPPER	Mayor de Blasio, let's begin with you.
1874	DE BLASIO	Thank you.
1875	DE BLASIO	For the last three years, we've watched Donald Trump pit working people against each other, black versus white, citizen versus immigrant.
1876	DE BLASIO	And why?
1877	DE BLASIO	So that the wealthy and the powerful he represents can hold the American dream hostage from everyone else.
1878	DE BLASIO	We can't let them get away with it.
1879	DE BLASIO	If we're going to beat Donald Trump, this has to be a party that stands for something.
1880	DE BLASIO	This has to be the party of labor unions.
1881	DE BLASIO	This has to be the party of universal healthcare.
1882	DE BLASIO	This has to be the party that's not afraid to say out loud we're going to tax the hell out of the wealthy.
1883	DE BLASIO	And when we do that, Donald Trump right on cue will call us socialists.
1884	DE BLASIO	Well, here's what I'll say to him.
1885	DE BLASIO	Donald, you're the real socialist.
1886	DE BLASIO	The problem is, it's socialism for the rich.
1887	DE BLASIO	We, here in this country, we don't have to take that anymore.
1888	DE BLASIO	We can fight back.
1889	DE BLASIO	If you agree that we can stand up to Donald Trump and we can stand up to the wealthy, then go to taxthehell.com and join us, so we can build a country that puts working people first.
1890	TAPPER	Senator Bennet?
1891	BENNET	Thank you.
1892	BENNET	Thank you very much.
1893	BENNET	What I want to say to all of you tonight is, we have been here before as a country.
1894	BENNET	We have faced challenges that we've  we actually even forget some of us tonight how hard the people fought, how hard they worked, how hard they organized, the votes they had to take, the people they had to get to the polls to make this country more democratic, more fair, and more free.
1895	BENNET	And now we have a person in the White House who has no appreciation of that history, who doesn't believe in the rule of law, who doesn't believe in the independence of the judiciary, who doesn't believe that climate change is real.
1896	BENNET	I think that we have an incredible opportunity in front of us, all of us, to come together just as our parents and grandparents did before them, and face challenges even harder than the ones that we face, but the only way we're going to be able to do it is to put the divisive politics of Donald Trump behind us and the divisive politics of the last 10 years behind us.
1897	BENNET	We need to come together united against a broken Washington, make Donald Trump a oneterm president, and begin to govern this country again for our kids and our grandkids who cannot do it for themselves.
1898	BENNET	We have to do it for them.
1899	BENNET	Please join me at michaelbennet.com.
1900	BENNET	Thanks for being here tonight.
1901	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1902	TAPPER	Governor Inslee?
1903	INSLEE	For decades, we have kicked the can down the road on climate change.
1904	INSLEE	And now under Donald Trump, we face a looming catastrophe.
1905	INSLEE	But it is not too late.
1906	INSLEE	We have one last chance.
1907	INSLEE	And when you have one chance in life, you take it.
1908	Think about this	Literally the survival of humanity on this planet and civilization as we know it is in the hands of the next president.
1909	Think about this	And we have to have a leader who will do what is necessary to save us.
1910	Think about this	And that includes making this the top priority of the next presidency.
1911	Think about this	And I alone on this panel am making a commitment that this will be the organizing principle of my administration not the first day, but every day.
1912	Think about this	And if you share my view of the urgency of this matter, I hope you'll join me, because we are up against powerful special fossil fuel interests.
1913	Think about this	And it is time to stand up on our legs and confront the fossil fuel special interests.
1914	Think about this	Because that is our salvation, what it depends upon.
1915	So I hope you will consider going to jayinslee.com and joining this effort. And I will close with this	I am confident and optimistic tonight, even in the face of this difficulty, because I know we can build a clean energy economy, I know we can save our children and our grandchildren.
1916	So I hope you will consider going to jayinslee.com and joining this effort. And I will close with this	I know that we can defeat climate change and we will defeat Donald Trump.
1917	So I hope you will consider going to jayinslee.com and joining this effort. And I will close with this	This is our moral responsibility.
1918	So I hope you will consider going to jayinslee.com and joining this effort. And I will close with this	And we will fulfill it.
1919	So I hope you will consider going to jayinslee.com and joining this effort. And I will close with this	Thank you very much.
1920	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1921	TAPPER	Senator Gillibrand?
1922	GILLIBRAND	Donald trump has really torn apart the moral fabric of this country, dividing us on every racial line, every religious line, every socioeconomic line he can find.
1923	GILLIBRAND	I'm running for president because I want to help people, and I actually have the experience and the ability to do that.
1924	GILLIBRAND	I've brought Congress together and actually made a difference in people's lives.
1925	GILLIBRAND	I also know how to beat Donald Trump.
1926	GILLIBRAND	He has broken his promises to the American people.
1927	GILLIBRAND	I've taken this fight directly to his backyard in Michigan and Ohio and in Pennsylvania, and I'll go to all the places in this country.
1928	GILLIBRAND	I will fight for your family.
1929	GILLIBRAND	It doesn't matter who you are, it doesn't matter where you live, it doesn't matter who you love.
1930	GILLIBRAND	Because that's my responsibility.
1931	GILLIBRAND	And I've done this before.
1932	GILLIBRAND	I started out in a 2to1 Republican district.
1933	GILLIBRAND	I won it twice.
1934	GILLIBRAND	I've never lost an election since.
1935	GILLIBRAND	And I not only bring people together electorally, but also legislatively.
1936	GILLIBRAND	I get things done.
1937	GILLIBRAND	So we need a president who's not afraid of the big challenges, of the big fights.
1938	GILLIBRAND	There is no false choice.
1939	GILLIBRAND	We don't need a liberal or progressive with big ideas or we don't need a moderate who can win back TrumpObama voters.
1940	GILLIBRAND	You need someone who can do both.
1941	GILLIBRAND	And that's who I am.
1942	GILLIBRAND	Please go to kirstengillibrand.com so I can make the next debate stage.
1943	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1944	TAPPER	Congresswoman Gabbard?
1945	GABBARD	Thank you.
1946	GABBARD	Now, Donald Trump and warmongering politicians in Washington have failed us.
1947	GABBARD	They continue to escalate tensions with other nucleararmed countries like Russia and China and North Korea, starting a new Cold War, pushing us closer and closer to the brink of nuclear catastrophe.
1948	GABBARD	Now, as we stand here tonight, there are thousands of nuclear missiles pointed at us.
1949	GABBARD	And if we were to get an attack right here tonight, we would have 30 minutes, 30 minutes before we were hit.
1950	GABBARD	And you would receive an alert like the one we received in Hawaii last year that would say, "Incoming missile.
1951	GABBARD	Seek immediate shelter.
1952	GABBARD	This is not a drill.
1953	GABBARD	Seek immediate shelter.
1954	GABBARD	This is not a drill."
1955	GABBARD	And you would see as we did, as my loved ones in Hawaii did, there is no shelter.
1956	GABBARD	This is the warmonger's hoax.
1957	GABBARD	There is no shelter.
1958	GABBARD	It's all a lie.
1959	GABBARD	As president, I will end this insanity, because it doesn't have to be this way.
1960	GABBARD	I will end these wasteful regime change wars, work to end this new Cold War through the use of diplomacy to deescalate these tensions and take the trillions of dollars that we've been wasting on these wars and on these weapons and redirect those resources into serving the needs of our people right here at home, things like health care for all, making sure everyone in this country has clean water to drink and clean air to breathe, investing in education, investing in our infrastructure.
1961	GABBARD	The needs are great.
1962	GABBARD	As your president, I will put your interests above all else.
1963	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1964	TAPPER	Secretary Castro?
1965	CASTRO	Well, first of all, let me say thank you to you, Jake, Dana, and to Don, and to everybody here and to those watching.
1966	CASTRO	You know, this election is all about what kind of nation we're going to become.
1967	CASTRO	You and I, we stand on the shoulders of folks who have made beds and made sacrifices, people that fought in wars and fought discrimination, folks that picked crops and stood in picket lines, and they helped build the wonderful nation that we live in today.
1968	CASTRO	Donald Trump has not been bashful in his cruelty.
1969	CASTRO	And I'm not going to be bashful in my common sense and compassion.
1970	CASTRO	I believe that we need leadership that understands that we need to move forward as one nation, with one destiny.
1971	CASTRO	Our destiny in the years to come is to be the smartest, the healthiest, the fairest and the most prosperous nation on Earth.
1972	CASTRO	If you want to help me build that America for the future, I hope you'll go to juliancastro.com.
1973	CASTRO	And on January 20th, 2021, we'll say together, "Adios to Donald Trump."
1974	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1975	TAPPER	Mr. Yang?
1976	YANG	You know what the talking heads couldn't stop talking about after the last debate?
1977	YANG	It's not the fact that I'm somehow number four on the stage in national polling.
1978	YANG	It was the fact that I wasn't wearing a tie.
1979	YANG	Instead of talking about automation and our future, including the fact that we automated away 4 million manufacturing jobs, hundreds of thousands right here in Michigan, we're up here with makeup on our faces and our rehearsed attack lines, playing roles in this reality TV show.
1980	YANG	It's one reason why we elected a reality TV star as our president.
1981	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
1982	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1983	YANG	We need to be laserfocused on solving the real challenges of today, like the fact that the most common jobs in America may not exist in a decade, or that most Americans cannot pay their bills.
1984	YANG	My flagship proposal, the freedom dividend, would put $1,000 a month into the hands of every American adult.
1985	YANG	It would be a gamechanger for millions of American families.
1986	YANG	If you care more about your family and your kids than my neckwear, enter your zip code at yang2020.com and see what $1,000 a month would mean to your community.
1987	YANG	I have done the math.
1988	YANG	It's not left it's not right.
1989	YANG	It's forward.
1990	YANG	And that is how we're going to beat Donald Trump in 2020.
1991	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
1992	TAPPER	Senator Booker?
1993	BOOKER	Thank you.
1994	BOOKER	First, I just want to give a lot of thanks to the city of Detroit.
1995	BOOKER	They're hosting us today, and one of the reasons I respect this city is because it has the kind of defiant love that I find in many American cities, including the city of Newark.
1996	BOOKER	And Detroit is turning around and Newark is turning around because we let no one divide us, no one demean or degrade us or underestimate or worth.
1997	BOOKER	We pulled together and fought for common purpose and common cause.
1998	BOOKER	That's the history of this city.
1999	BOOKER	My mom is sitting there who was born in the city of Detroit, born to a guy...
2000	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
2001	BOOKER	... that was a UAW worker, my grandfather, who pulled his family out of poverty in the Depression.
2002	BOOKER	My grandmother joined him.
2003	BOOKER	She was really entrepreneurial, opened a pool hall and a laundromat right here in this city.
2004	BOOKER	That is the American dream.
2005	BOOKER	And so many of us have stories like that.
2006	BOOKER	But the dream of this country is under threat right now.
2007	BOOKER	While, my mom's generation, 80  95% of baby boomers did better than their parents.
2008	BOOKER	It's now just a coin toss for millennials.
2009	BOOKER	We have a real crisis in our country, and the crisis is Donald Trump, but not only Donald Trump.
2010	BOOKER	I have a frustration that sometimes people are saying the only thing they want is to beat Donald Trump.
2011	BOOKER	Well, that is the floor and not the ceiling.
2012	BOOKER	The way we beat Donald Trump is not just focusing on him.
2013	BOOKER	He wants to take all the oxygen out of the room.
2014	BOOKER	It's when we start focusing on each other and understanding that our common bonds and our common purpose to address our common pain is what has saved us before.
2015	BOOKER	It's what's going to save us now.
2016	BOOKER	That is the kind of leader that I am going to be as president of the United States, not just uniting the Democratic Party but making sure that we put more "indivisible" back into this one nation under God.
2017	BOOKER	And if you believe like I do, please go to corybooker.com and join the mission.

2019	TAPPER	Senator Harris?
2020	HARRIS	So in my background as attorney general of California, I took on the big banks who preyed on the homeowners, many of whom lost their homes and will never be able to buy another.
2021	HARRIS	I've taken on the forprofit colleges who preyed on students, put them out of business.
2022	HARRIS	I've preyed on transnational criminal organizations that have preyed on women and children.
2023	HARRIS	And I will tell you, we have a predator living in the White House.
2024	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
2025	HARRIS	And I'm going to tell you something.
2026	HARRIS	Donald Trump has predatory nature and predatory instincts.
2027	HARRIS	And the thing about predators is this.
2028	HARRIS	By their very nature, they prey on people they perceive to be weak.
2029	HARRIS	They prey on people they perceive to be vulnerable.
2030	HARRIS	They prey on people who are in need of help, often desperate for help.
2031	HARRIS	And predators are cowards.
2032	HARRIS	What we need is someone who is going to be on that debate stage with Donald Trump and defeat him by being able to prosecute the case against four more years.
2033	HARRIS	And let me tell you, we've got a long rap sheet.
2034	HARRIS	We're looking at someone who passed a tax bill benefiting the top 1 percent and the biggest corporations in this country when he said he would help working families.
2035	HARRIS	We've got a person who has put babies in cages and separated children from their parents.
2036	HARRIS	We have someone who passed a socalled trade policy that was trade policy by tweet and has resulted in a tax on American families.
2037	HARRIS	So we must defeat him and then, in turning the page, write the next chapter for our country.
2038	HARRIS	And that has to be written in a way that recognizes what wakes people up at 300 in the morning.
2039	HARRIS	And that is my agenda, the 300 a.m. agenda that is focused on giving folks the jobs they need, getting their children the education they need, making sure they have the health care they need and the future they deserve.
2040	HARRIS	So please join me at kamalaharris.org.
