Even when President Barack Obama condemned what he described as failed policies and leadership, Huntsman, the former Republican Governor in Utah, welcomed American business ethics and the Constitution of the United States, which he described as the oldest people in the world. Huntsman said to the workers during the August 2, 2011 tour of Certronic, a manufacturing company in Milford, New Hampshire. \"We have the rule of law. We have the longest constitution alive. What we don't have is leadership. The rule of law in America is difficult to question, and as for the presidential leadership, we will leave it to the candidates for discussion. But does America really have the longest living constitution in the world? That sounds like a question for Polly Fruit. At first, we went directly to the source, the status of the National Constitution, which is the capital of independence in Philadelphia. At the age of 222, America &apos; s governing document is widely regarded as the world &apos; s longest living constitution, according to Dr. Stephen Frank, the chief constitutional historian. The Constitution of Norway, which came into force in 1814, was ratified in 1789, and the Constitution of Belgium was implemented in 1831, according to the list compiled by Tom Jensburg and Rosalind Dixon, Professors of Constitutional Law at the University of Chicago. \"It's the most permanent constitution in the world today,\" said Frank, from the status of the constitution. \"History agrees. It's been longer than any other written constitution.\" But that left us wondering, what constitutes a constitution? The definition of the term is an important issue in political theory, according to Jensburg, Professor of Law of the University of Chicago. However, the term is broadly defined as a set of laws or laws that govern \"formulate basic rules on the structure of government and its relationship with citizens,\" Jensburg wrote in an e-mail. He also serves as a senior investigator in the Comparative Constitutions Project, a research project initiated at the University of Illinois for the analysis of documents organized worldwide. In their study, project researchers found that permanent constitutions are usually easy to adjust to allow growth and reinterpretation, as Jensburg said, and are usually written by broad segments of people to include many views. \"The funny thing is, the things that make constitutions last don't really exist in the U.S. One,\" he said, noting that the U.S. Constitution was written by 100 rich white men. \"It seems so extraordinary why he's so likely.\" In other parts of the world, many countries do not follow a single constitution, but instead operate according to what historians call a \"multi-textual approach,\" where national laws are based on different documents and laws, many of which were previously the Constitution of the United States. The United Kingdom, for example, draws its constitution from a large number of documents, including Magna Carta, dating back to 1297, according to Jeff Rochty, editor-in-chief of the world &apos; s illustrated constitutions, a publication from William S. Hein, & Co. \"All said that it is traditional to consider that the United States Constitution is the oldest constitutional text in a single document alive. Anyway, other models return it, \"Rushty wrote in a e-mail. \"This is not even an ongoing debate on whether or not the form of the government of the Iroquois nations has had an impact on the writing of the Constitution of the United States.\" The Republic of San Marino is often considered to have the closest written administrative documents still in force. The Republic, a pocket surrounded by Italy, does not have an official constitution, but instead is subject to a series of six books written in Latin in the late 16th century that dictate the political system of the country, among other things. Our rule: historians and legal scholars alike may discuss the definition, but most of us are clear in our concept of the Constitution as a single governing document. As long as this is the case, there is no room for discussion. The United States Constitution is the longest living constitution in the world. However, there are other countries that have several older governing documents from the United States Constitution. We value Huntsman &apos; s claim as mostly true. On January 13, 2021, the distinguished fact-checkers announced in a story in which General David H. Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for security, saying, \"We're not working for you.\" Samantha Buterman: January 17, 2021 updated: after this clause comparing the length of the US Constitution to others around the world, two readers pointed out that the state of Massachusetts's constitution was even older. It was ratified in 1780, and served as a model for the drafters of the United States Constitution, which was written seven years later, according to an account provided by the Massachusetts Judicial Branch.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-12603"}
