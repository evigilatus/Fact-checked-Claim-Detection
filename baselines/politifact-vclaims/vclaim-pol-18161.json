That was a record; all-time record. I think we should do one of them every day, perhaps. How about five times a day? We\u2019ll do one five times a day. But that was something to watch and \u2014 I had no idea. We walked back, I said, \u2018So, how did that work out?\u2019 They said, \u2018Sir, you just set a new record in the history of the stock market.\u2019 So, that was pretty good.\"\nThe market did make a record surge on March 13, 2020, and the surge accelerated during Trump\u2019s news conference that afternoon.\u00a0\nBut that record came a day after the steepest decline ever.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average, the most popular measure of the stock market, gained 1,985 points on Friday, March 13. That was its biggest point gain ever, with the \"late-day surge\" coming \"while Trump was speaking,\" the Associated Press reported. The business and financial news network CNBC and other news organizations reported the same.\nIn his remarks, Trump declared the coronavirus pandemic a national emergency, announced greater availability of testing in the coming days and announced the purchase of oil for the strategic petroleum reserve \u2014 steps that may have helped lift the Dow.\nHis Rose Garden news conference started at 3:30 p.m. EDT and lasted an hour and 11 minutes, including remarks given by members of Trump\u2019s Coronavirus Task Force. At the start of the speech, the Dow was at 21,747.52. By the market\u2019s close at 4 p.m., while Trump\u2019s news conference was continuing, it was at 23,175.92, for a gain of 1,428 points over the course of the speech.\nThat gain itself was larger than the previous record for the largest point gain in a day \u2014 1,293.96 points on March 2, 2020.\n\"Stocks rallied, shooting sharply upward in the last half-hour of trading as investors appeared to gain confidence that the Trump administration has a plan to combat the outbreak from both a health care and economic perspective,\" AP reported.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut that upward acceleration followed a record decline, as news organizations also reported.\nAs Barron\u2019s put it: \"The Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted 10% on Thursday, marking its biggest one-day percentage (and point) drop since the Black Monday stock market crash in 1987.\"\nThe rally \"only recovered most of the losses suffered a day earlier,\" MarketWatch reported, adding that the Dow is \"in a bear market.\"\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that those gains were fleeting. The increases of March 13 were wiped out by the next trading day, Monday, March 16, when the Dow dropped like a rock and opened 2,240 points down at 20,935.70 and then fell another 248 points by the market\u2019s close. Such sharp rises and declines are common during times of stress in the economy.\n\"One good day was really more of a dead-cat bounce, as the market fell still further after that,\" Tulane University business professor Peter Ricchiuti told PolitiFact. \"Also, the stock market is not the economy. It\u2019s a measure of projected corporate profits. Very different things.\"\nKathleen Day, lecturer at the Johns Hopkins Carey Business School and author of a book on financial crises, said in an interview: \"The big picture here is the stock market is gyrating. It\u2019s unstable because of the virus itself and because of the lack of leadership (from Trump). The market wouldn\u2019t have gone up so much if it hadn\u2019t gone down so much.\"\nThe White House didn\u2019t respond to our requests for information.\nTrump didn\u2019t specify what type of record was set, but a point gain is one\u00a0 legitimate measure. At the same time, large point gains and declines are natural when the Dow is at a high number. The index was marching toward 30,000 just a few weeks earlier. Stock watchers pay more attention to percentage changes on a given day or over time as a sign of the market\u2019s strength. On that score, the gain for the day of Trump\u2019s news conference was the largest percentage increase since October 2008.\nOur ruling\nTrump said that \"over a 45-minute period that we had the press conference\" on the coronavirus on March 13, 2020, the stock market set \"an all-time record.\"\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average registered its largest-ever point gain on March 13, with gains accelerating during Trump\u2019s news conference. But that occurred one day after the Dow\u2019s biggest point decline ever, and the gains were wiped out the next trading day.\u00a0\nTrump\u2019s statement is partially accurate, but leaves out important details.
