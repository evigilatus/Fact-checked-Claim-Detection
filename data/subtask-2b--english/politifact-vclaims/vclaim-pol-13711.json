Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., sought to draw a contrast between the hemorrhaging of jobs nationally and an expansion of jobs in government.\n\n\"While the government grew,\" she said, \"we lost more than 2 million jobs.\"\n\nAnalyzing this comment is somewhat tricky, because Bachmann\u2019s time frame is open to interpretation (and her office didn\u2019t return our inquiry seeking an explanation). Earlier in her comments, she referred to the jobless rate \"within three months\" after the stimulus bill became law, and she also referred to the month when the unemployment rate hit 9.4 percent. Since May 2009 fits both of those descriptions, we\u2019ll assume Bachmann was using that as her yardstick.\n\nShe\u2019s also vague about which populations she\u2019s measuring. When she says \"the government,\" she could mean any one of three things -- government as a whole (federal, state and local), the federal government only or the federal government minus the U.S. Postal Service, a carve-out sometimes used by economists. And when she says that \"we lost more than 2 million jobs,\" she could mean employment overall or private-sector employment only (as a counterpoint to the government employment she cited in the first half of the comparison).\n\nBecause we don't know which she meant, we looked at all these options.\n\nTo do this, we examined data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the government\u2019s official arbiter of employment data. Here\u2019s how the data breaks down between May 2009 and December 2010, the most recent month for which figures are available:\n\n\u2022 All government employment (federal, state and local). Start: 22,628,000. End: 22,259,000. Change: Down 369,000.\n\n\u2022 Federal government employment. Start: 2,865,000. End: 2,852,000. Change: Down 13,000.\n\n\u2022 Federal government employment minus the U.S. Postal Service. Start: 2,156,000. End: 2,208,700. Change: Up 52,700.\n\n\u2022 Total national employment. Start: 131,155,000. End: 130,712,000. Change: Down 443,000.\n\n\u2022 Total private sector employment. Start: 108,527,000. End: 108,453,000. Change: Down 74,000.\n\nSo let\u2019s look first at whether \"the government grew.\" Bachmann would be wrong if she meant to refer either to total government (federal, state and local) or to total federal employment. Both of those measures lost jobs during that period.\n\nHowever, she\u2019d be correct if she meant that non-Postal Service federal employment grew.\n\nNow, what about Bachmann\u2019s claim that \"we lost more than 2 million jobs\"?\n\nNeither total national employment nor private-sector employment declined by anything close to her number -- at least during the period she appeared to specify. To get to 2 million total jobs lost, you have to move the baseline back to February 2009. Shifting the time frame three months in one direction or the other wouldn\u2019t ordinarily make much of a difference, but in this case, it does, because job losses nationally were so steep during early 2009. Total employment fell from 132,823,000 in February 2009 to 130,594,000 in May, down 2.2 million jobs, and now stands at 130,712,000, down 2.1 million.\n\nSo where does this leave us? When measured in two common ways, Bachmann is wrong about government jobs increasing, but she\u2019s right using a third, less intuitive measurement -- that is, for federal employment not including the U.S. Postal Service.\n\nAs for total employment, she\u2019s off by quite a bit if you begin the clock in May 2009, but you only have to move the time frame back by three months in order to meet her 2 million threshold.\n\nSo one part of her statement is untrue except by one uncommon measurement, and the other part is incorrect if the starting date is May 2009 but accurate counting from February 2009 and in tune with the general trend since the start of Obama\u2019s term. On balance, we rate her comment Half True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H.
