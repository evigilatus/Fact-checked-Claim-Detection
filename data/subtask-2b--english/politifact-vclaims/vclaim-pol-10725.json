So, the University of South Florida graduate student and Republican activist is trying to use her conservative message to stand out from the pack.\n\nDuring a recent interview with an editorial writer and reporter from the Times, O\u2019Connor said she brings a different perspective to Pasco\u2019s problems.\n\nOne problem? Excessive spending, she said, casting Pasco County\u2019s budget in stark terms.\n\n\"Our budget has doubled in the past three years,\" she said, echoing a claim she made at a recent candidate forum. \"I think we need to prioritize spending.\"\n\nThe claim prompted a double take. Here\u2019s what happened next:\n\nEditorial writer C.T. Bowen: \"I\u2019ve got to back you up. The budget\u2019s doubled the last three years?\"\n\nO\u2019Connor: \"Yeah.\"\n\nBowen: \"How\u2019s that possible?\"\n\nO\u2019Connor: \"It\u2019s possible. I talked to Mr. Nurrenbrock (the county\u2019s longtime budget chief). You can double-check it with him. It has. In the past three years. It\u2019s now over $1 billion.\"\n\nReporter Lee Logan: \"Um, there must be\u2026 I guess\u2026 That\u2019s not the general revenue portion of the budget?\"\n\nO\u2019Connor: \"That\u2019s the total budget.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBob Hackworth\n\n\nstated on September 14, 2010 in a candidates forum in Dunedin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The downsizing of Pinellas County government resulted in about 1,200 people being laid off in a 12 percent unemployment market. \u2026 I can tell you that every one of them was hired from the time that Ms. Latvala went into office in 2000.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy David DeCamp \u2022 September 24, 2010\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClearly there\u2019s something funky going on here.\n\nSo we called budget chief Mike Nurrenbrock. He pointed us to the budget\u2019s final summary page. Sure enough, under \"total county budget,\" it includes $554 million for Fiscal Year 2011, $1.1 billion for Fiscal Year 2012, and $1.1 billion for the proposed budget that begins Oct. 1.\n\nBut Nurrenbrock explained that line doesn\u2019t exactly compare apples to apples. Here\u2019s the key: the FY2011 figure lists what was actually spent that year. The next two numbers are the total budget, even though officials know a good chunk of the money won\u2019t be spent that year.\n\nNurrenbrock said that \"dramatic difference\" is money that is rolled from each year to the next. That includes reserves, large capital projects and money for bond issues.\n\n\"There\u2019s a major portion of our budget that just goes forward the next year, pretty much every year,\" he said.\n\nSome high-profile examples: The county has $32 million in general fund reserves in case a major storm hits, and there is a similar $5 million pot in the municipal service fund. About $11.5 million in tourism taxes have been collecting for 20 years, and commissioners recently earmarked the money for a sports complex in Wesley Chapel.\n\nThere is a $7 million fund for economic development incentives or infrastructure. And there\u2019s a total of $93 million in transportation impact fees. Those are set aside for specific projects that simply haven\u2019t gone out to bid. That figure includes about $40 million for the long-stalled Ridge Road extension.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nNurrenbrock said it\u2019s more accurate to compare the total spending plans from each year. Here are the last five bottom-line budgets: $980 million (FY09), $949 million (FY10), $1.03 billion (FY11), $1.09 billion (FY 12), and next year\u2019s proposed $1.1 billion.\n\nO\u2019Connor acknowledged the mistake. She said it stems from trying to make sense of a complex, 292-page spending plan. Challengers are often at a disadvantage to incumbents regarding budgetary details, because sitting commissioners are supposed to know how the county\u2019s money is spent.\n\n\"As candidates, it\u2019s very difficult to look at that budget and come up with specific things to cut,\" she said. \"When you try to get insight with the county administration, they\u2019re not the easiest to work with.\"\n\nFair enough. Also, O\u2019Connor isn\u2019t the only candidate to make a wild claim about Pasco\u2019s spending. District 3 hopeful Kathryn Starkey recently retracted a line about reining in \"runaway local government spending\" that was on her campaign flier. In an interview, she said, \"All in all, I think our county government has done a good job of being fiscally conservative in a tough time.\"\n\nBut O\u2019Connor\u2019s claim about a ballooning county budget is shocking \u2014 especially as property tax collections have shriveled in the past several years. The claim is also incorrect. O\u2019Connor\u2019s statement earns a False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10725"}
