0001	HOLT	Good evening and welcome to the NBC News Youtube Democratic candidate's debate.
0002	HOLT	After all the campaigning, soon, Americans will have their say with the first votes of the 2016 campaign just 15 days away in Iowa.
0003	HOLT	And New Hampshire not far behind.
0004	HOLT	Tonight will be the final opportunity to see these candidates face to face before the voting begins.
0005	HOLT	Our purpose here tonight is to highlight and examine the differences among the three Democratic candidates.
0006	HOLT	So let's get started.
0007	HOLT	Please welcome Secretary Hillary Clinton, Senator Bernie Sanders and Governor Martin O'Malley.
0008	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0009	HOLT	Well, welcome to all of you.
0010	HOLT	Hope you're excited, we're excited.
0011	HOLT	We want to thank our hosts, the Congressional Black Caucus Institute.
0012	HOLT	I'm joined by my colleague Andrea Mitchell tonight.
0013	HOLT	The rules are simple.
0014	HOLT	Sixty seconds for answers, 30 seconds for followups or rebuttals.
0015	HOLT	I know you'll all keep exactly to time, so our job should be pretty easy here tonight.
0016	HOLT	We'll have questions from the Youtube community throughout the debate.
0017	HOLT	This is a critical point in the race.
0018	HOLT	You've been defining your differences with each other especially vigorously in the last week on the campaign trail.
0019	HOLT	We're here to facilitate this conversation on behalf of the voters so that they know exactly where you stand as you face off tonight.
0020	HOLT	Let's have a great debate.
0021	HOLT	We'll begin with 45 second opening statements from each candidate, starting with Secretary Clinton.
0022	CLINTON	Well, good evening.
0023	CLINTON	And I want to thank the Congressional Black Caucus Institute and the people of Charleston for hosting us here on the eve of Martin Luther King Day tomorrow.
0024	CLINTON	You know, I remember well when my youth minister took me to hear Dr. King.
0025	CLINTON	I was a teenager.
0026	CLINTON	And his moral clarity, the message that he conveyed that evening really stayed with me and helped to set me on a path to service.
0027	CLINTON	I also remember that he spent the last day of his life in Memphis, fighting for dignity and higher pay for working people.
0028	CLINTON	And that is our fight still.
0029	CLINTON	We have to get the economy working and incomes rising for everyone, including those who have been left out and left behind.
0030	CLINTON	We have to keep our communities and our country safe.
0031	CLINTON	We need a president who can do all aspects of the job.
0032	CLINTON	I understand that this is the hardest job in the world.
0033	CLINTON	I'm prepared and ready to take it on and I hope to earn your support to be the nominee of the Democratic Party and the next president of the United States.
0034	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0035	HOLT	Thank you.
0036	HOLT	Senator Sanders, your opening statement, sir.
0037	SANDERS	Thank you.
0038	SANDERS	As we honor the extraordinary life of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., it's important not only that we remember what he stood for, but that we pledge to continue his vision to transform our country.
0039	SANDERS	As we look out at our country today, what the American people understand is we have an economy that's rigged, that ordinary Americans are working longer hours for lower wages, 47 million people living in poverty, and almost all of the new income and wealth going to the top one percent.
0040	SANDERS	And then, to make a bad situation worse, we have a corrupt campaign finance system where millionaires and billionaires are spending extraordinary amounts of money to buy elections.
0041	SANDERS	This campaign is about a political revolution to not only elect the president, but to transform this country.
0042	HOLT	Senator, thank you.
0043	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0044	HOLT	And Governor O'Malley, your opening statement, sir.
0045	O'MALLEY	Thank you.
0046	O'MALLEY	My name is Martin O'Malley, I was born the year Dr. King delivered his "I Have A Dream" speech.
0047	O'MALLEY	And I want to thank the people of South Carolina, not only for hosting our debate here tonight, but also for what you taught all of us in the aftermath of the tragic shooting at Mother Emanuel Church.
0048	O'MALLEY	You taught us, in fact, in keeping with Dr. King's teaching, that love would have the final word when you took down the Confederate flag from your state house let go of the past and move forward.
0049	O'MALLEY	Eight years ago, you brought forward a new leader in Barack Obama to save our country from the second Great Depression.
0050	O'MALLEY	And that's what he's done.
0051	O'MALLEY	Our country's doing better, we're creating jobs again.
0052	O'MALLEY	But in order to make good on the promise of equal opportunity and equal justice under the law, and we have urgent work to do, and the voices of anger and fear and division that we've heard coming off of the Republican presidential podiums are pretty loud.
0053	O'MALLEY	We need new leadership.
0054	O'MALLEY	We need to come together as a people and build on the good things that President Obama has done.
0055	O'MALLEY	That's why I'm running for president.
0056	O'MALLEY	I need your help, I ask for your vote, and I look forward to moving our country forward once again.
0057	O'MALLEY	Thank you.
0058	HOLT	All right.
0059	HOLT	And Governor, thank you.
0060	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0061	HOLT	All right, to our first question, now.
0062	HOLT	The first question, I'll be addressing to all of the candidates.
0063	HOLT	President Obama came to office determined to swing for the fences on health care reform.
0064	HOLT	Voters want to know how you would define your presidency?
0065	HOLT	How would you think big?
0066	HOLT	So complete this sentence in my first 100 days in office, my top three priorities will be  fill in the blank.
0067	HOLT	Senator Sanders.
0068	SANDERS	Well, that's what our campaign is about.
0069	SANDERS	It is thinking big.
0070	SANDERS	It is understanding that in the wealthiest country in the history of the world, we should have health care for every man, woman, and child as a right that we should raise the minimum wage to at least $15 an hour that we have got to create millions of decent paying jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure.
0071	SANDERS	So, what my first days are about is bringing America together, to end the decline of the middle class, to tell the wealthiest people in this country that yes, they are going to start paying their fair share of taxes, and that we are going to have a government that works for all of us, and not just big campaign contributors.
0072	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0073	HOLT	Secretary Clinton, same question, my first 100 days in office, my top three priorities will be.
0074	CLINTON	I would work quickly to present to the Congress my plans for creating more good jobs in manufacturing, infrastructure, clean and renewable energy, raising the minimum wage, and guaranteeing, finally, equal pay for women's work.
0075	CLINTON	I would also...
0076	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0077	CLINTON	...I would also be presenting my plans to build on the Affordable Care Act and to improve it by decreasing the outofpocket costs by putting a cap on prescription drug costs by looking for ways that we can put the prescription drug business and the health insurance company business on a more stable platform that doesn't take too much money out of the pockets of hardworking Americans.
0078	CLINTON	And third, I would be working, in every way that I knew, to bring our country together.
0079	CLINTON	We do have too much division, too much mean spiritedness.
0080	CLINTON	There's a lot we have to do on immigration reform, on voting rights, on campaign finance reform, but we need to do it together.
0081	CLINTON	That's how we'll have the kind of country for the 21st century that we know will guarantee our children and grandchildren the kind of future they deserve.
0082	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0083	HOLT	Governor O'Malley, same question.
0084	O'MALLEY	Thank you.
0085	O'MALLEY	First of all, I would lay out an agenda to make wages go up again for all Americans, rather than down.
0086	O'MALLEY	Equal pay for equal work, making it easier rather than harder for people to join labor unions and bargain collectively for better wages getting 11 million of our neighbors out of the underground shadow economy by passing comprehensive immigration reform, raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, however we can, wherever we can.
0087	O'MALLEY	Secondly, I believe the greatest business opportunity to come to the United States of America in 100 years is climate change.
0088	O'MALLEY	And I put forward a plan to move us to a 100 percent clean electric energy grid by 2050 and create 5 million jobs along the way.
0089	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0090	HOLT	Thank you.
0091	HOLT	You've all...
0092	O'MALLEY	Finally  I'm sorry, that was second, Lester.
0093	O'MALLEY	And third and finally, we need a new agenda for America's cities.
0094	O'MALLEY	We have not had a new agenda for America's cities since Jimmy Carter.
0095	O'MALLEY	We need a new agenda for America cities that will invest in the talents and skills in our people, that will invest in CBVG transportation, infrastructure and transit options, and make our cities the leading edge in this move to a redesigned built clean green energy future that will employ our people.
0096	HOLT	All right governor thank you.
0097	HOLT	We've all laid out large visions and we're going to cover a lot of the ground you talked about as we continue in the evening.
0098	HOLT	The last couple of weeks of this campaign have featured some of the sharpest exchanges in the race.
0099	HOLT	Let's start with one of them, the issue of guns.
0100	HOLT	Senator Sanders, last week Secretary Clinton called you quote, "a pretty reliable vote for the gun lobby."
0101	HOLT	Right before the debate you changed your position on immunity from lawsuits for gun manufacturers, can you tell us why?
0102	SANDERS	Well, I think Secretary Clinton knows that what she says is very disingenuous.
0103	SANDERS	I have a Dminus voting record from the NRA.
0104	SANDERS	I was in 1988, there were three candidates running for congress in the state of Vermont, I stood up to the gun lobby and came out and maintained the position that in this country we should not be selling military style assault weapons.
0105	SANDERS	I have supported from day one and instant background check to make certain that people who should have guns do not have guns.
0106	SANDERS	And that includes people of criminal backgrounds, people who are mentally unstable.
0107	SANDERS	I support what President Obama is doing in terms of trying to close the gun show loop holes and I think it should be a federal crime if people act as dormant.
0108	SANDERS	We have seen in this city a horrendous tragedy of a crazed person praying with people in the coming up and shooting nine people.
0109	SANDERS	This should not be a political issue.
0110	SANDERS	What we should be doing is working together.
0111	SANDERS	And by the way, as a senator from a rural state that has virtually no gun control, I believe that I am in an excellent position to bring people together to fight the sensible...
0112	HOLT	Senator, but you didn't answer the question that you did change your position on immunity from gun manufacturers.
0113	HOLT	So can you...
0114	SANDERS	What I have said, is that gun manufacturer's liability bill has some good provisions among other things, we've prohibited ammunition that would've killed cops who had protection on.
0115	SANDERS	We have child safety protection work on guns in that legislation.
0116	SANDERS	And what we also said, "is a small mom and pop gun shop who sells a gun legally to somebody should not be held liable if somebody does something terrible with that gun."
0117	SANDERS	So what I said is, " I would relook at it."
0118	SANDERS	We are going to re look at it and I will support stronger provisions.
0119	HOLT	Secretary Clinton, would you like to respond to Senator Sanders.
0120	CLINTON	Yes look, I have made it clear based on Senator Sanders' own record that he has voted with the NRA, with the gun lobby numerous times.
0121	CLINTON	He voted against the Brady Bill five times.
0122	CLINTON	He voted for what we call, the Charleston Loophole.
0123	CLINTON	He voted for immunity from gunmakers and sellers which the NRA said, "was the most important piece of gun legislation in 20 years. "
0124	CLINTON	He voted to let guns go onto the Amtrak, guns go into National Parks.
0125	CLINTON	He voted against doing research to figure out how we can save lives.
0126	CLINTON	Let's not forget what this is about, 90 people a day die from gun violence in our country.
0127	CLINTON	That's 33,000 people a year.
0128	CLINTON	One of the most horrific examples not a block from here where we had nine people murdered.
0129	CLINTON	Now, I am pleased to hear that Senator Sanders has reversed his position on immunity and I look forward to him joining with those members of congress who have already introduced legislation.
0130	CLINTON	There is no other industry in America that was given the total pass that the gun makers and dealers were and that needs to be reversed.
0131	HOLT	All right, Governor O'Malley, you signed tough gun control measures as governor of Maryland and there are a lot Democrats in the audience here in South Carolina who own guns.
0132	HOLT	This conversation might be worrying many of them.
0133	HOLT	They may be hearing, "you want to take my guns.
0134	HOLT	What would you say to them?
0135	O'MALLEY	This is what I would say Lester, look see, I've listened to Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders go back and forth on which of them has the most inconsistent record on gun safety legislation and I would have to agree with both of them.
0136	O'MALLEY	They've both been inconsistent when it comes to this issue.
0137	O'MALLEY	I'm the one candidate on this stage that actually brought people together to pass comprehensive gun safety legislation.
0138	O'MALLEY	This is very personal to me being from Baltimore.
0139	O'MALLEY	I will never forget one occasion visiting a little boy in Johns' Hopkins Hospital, he was getting a birthday haircut, the age of three when drug dealers turned that barbershop into a shooting gallery and that boy's head was pierced with a bullet.
0140	O'MALLEY	And I remember visiting him, it did not kill him  I remember visiting him and his mother in Johns Hopkins Hospital.
0141	O'MALLEY	He was getting a birthday haircut, the age of three when drug dealers turned that barbershop into a shooting gallery, and that boys head was pierced with a bullet.
0142	O'MALLEY	And, I remember visiting him, it did not kill him.
0143	O'MALLEY	I remember visiting him and his mother in Johns Hopkins Hospital.
0144	O'MALLEY	In his diapers with tubes running in and out of his head, same age as my little boy.
0145	O'MALLEY	So, after the slaughter of the kids in Connecticut last year, we brought people together.
0146	O'MALLEY	We did pass in our state comprehensive gun safety legislation.
0147	O'MALLEY	It did have a ban on combat assault weapons, universal background checks, and you know what?
0148	O'MALLEY	We did not interrupt a single person's hunting season.
0149	O'MALLEY	I've never met a self respecting deer hunter that needed an AR15 to down a deer.
0150	O'MALLEY	And, so...
0151	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0152	O'MALLEY	...we're able to actually do these things.
0153	HOLT	Alright, Governor, thank you.
0154	HOLT	Secretary Clinton, this is a community that has suffered a lot of heartache in the last year.
0155	HOLT	Of course, as you mentioned, the church shootings.
0156	HOLT	We won't forget the video of Walter Scott being shot in the back while running from police.
0157	HOLT	We understand that a jury will decide whether that police officer was justified, but it plays straight to the fears of many African American men that their lives are cheap.
0158	HOLT	Is that perception, or in your view, is it reality?
0159	CLINTON	Well, sadly it's reality, and it has been heartbreaking, and incredibly outraging to see the constant stories of young men like Walter Scott, as you said, who have been killed by police officers.
0160	CLINTON	Their needs to be a concerted effort to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system.
0161	CLINTON	And, that requires a very clear, agenda for retraining police officers, looking at ways to end racial profiling, finding more ways to really bring the disparities that stalk our country into high relief.
0162	CLINTON	One out of three African American men may well end up going to prison.
0163	CLINTON	That's the statistic.
0164	CLINTON	I want people hear to think what we would be doing if it was one out of three white men, and very often, the black men are arrested, convicted and incarcerated ...
0165	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0166	CLINTON	...for offensive that do not lead to the same results for white men.
0167	CLINTON	So, we have a very serious problem that we can no longer ignore.
0168	HOLT	You time is up.
0169	HOLT	Senator Sanders, my next question is...
0170	SANDERS	...Well, I  look...
0171	HOLT	...
0172	HOLT	It's actually  actually my next question is to you...
0173	SANDERS	... Let me respond to what the secretary said.
0174	SANDERS	We have a criminal justice system which is broken.
0175	SANDERS	Who in America is satisfied that we have more people in jail than any other country on Earth, including China?
0176	SANDERS	Disproportionately African American, and Latino.
0177	SANDERS	Who is satisfied that 51% of African American young people are either unemployed, or underemployed?
0178	SANDERS	Who is satisfied that millions of people have police records for possessing marijuana when the CEO's of Wall Street companies who destroyed our economy have no police records.
0179	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0180	HOLT	Senator Sanders...
0181	SANDERS	... We need to take a very hard look at our...
0182	HOLT	Senator.
0183	HOLT	Senator Sanders...
0184	SANDERS	... criminal justice system, investing in jobs, and education not in jails and incarceration .
0185	HOLT	... Just over a week ago the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus endorsed Secretary Clinton, not you.
0186	HOLT	He said that choosing her over you was not a hard decision.
0187	HOLT	In fact, our polling shows she's beating you more than two to one among minority voters.
0188	HOLT	How can you be the nominee if you don't have that support?
0189	SANDERS	Well, let me talk about polling.
0190	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
0191	SANDERS	As Secretary Clinton well knows, when this campaign began she was 50 points ahead of me.
0192	SANDERS	We were all of three percentage points.
0193	SANDERS	Guess what?
0194	SANDERS	In Iowa, New Hampshire, the race is very, very close.
0195	SANDERS	Maybe we're ahead New Hampshire.
0196	SYSTEM	[ cheering ]
0197	SANDERS	In terms of polling, guess what?
0198	SANDERS	We are running ahead of Secretary Clinton.
0199	SANDERS	In terms of taking on my taking on my good friend, Donald Trump, beating him by 19 points in New Hampshire, 13 points in the last national poll that we saw.
0200	SANDERS	To answer your question.
0201	SANDERS	When the African American community becomes familiar with my Congressional record and with our agenda, and with our views on the economy, and criminal justice  just as the general population has become more supportive, so will the African American community, so will the Latino community.
0202	SANDERS	We have the momentum, we're on a path to a victory.
0203	SYSTEM	[ applause and cheering ]
0204	O'MALLEY	Lester, I
0205	SYSTEM	[ inaudible ]
0206	HOLT	Governor, I'm going to come to you in a second.
0207	HOLT	Google searches for the words, "Black Lives Matter" surpassed, "civil rights movement".
0208	HOLT	And, here in South Carolina, "black lives matter" was the number one trending political issue. Governor O'Malley, you've campaigned on your record as governor of Maryland, and before that, the mayor of Baltimore.
0209	HOLT	Last year, of course, Baltimore was rocked by violent unrest in the wake of the death of Freddie Gray.
0210	HOLT	And right from the start of your campaign, you've been dogged by those who blame your toughoncrime, socalled zero tolerance policies as mayor for contributing to that unrest.
0211	HOLT	What responsibility do you bear?
0212	O'MALLEY	Yes, let's talk about this.
0213	O'MALLEY	When I ran for mayor in 1999, Lester, it was not because our city was doing well.
0214	O'MALLEY	It was because we were burying over 300 young, poor black men every single year.
0215	O'MALLEY	And that's why I ran, because, yes, black lives matter.
0216	O'MALLEY	And we did a number of things.
0217	O'MALLEY	We weren't able to make our city immune from setbacks as the Freddie Gray unrest and tragic death showed.
0218	O'MALLEY	But we were able to save a lot of lives doing things that actually worked to improve police and community relations.
0219	O'MALLEY	The truth of the matter is, we created a civilian review board.
0220	O'MALLEY	And many of these things are in the new agenda for criminal justice reform that I've put forward.
0221	O'MALLEY	We created a civilian review board, gave them their own detectives.
0222	O'MALLEY	We required the reporting of discourtesy, use of excessive force, lethal force.
0223	O'MALLEY	I repealed the possession of marijuana as a crime in our state.
0224	O'MALLEY	I drove our incarceration rate down to 20year lows, and drove violent crime down to 30year lows, and became the first governor south of the MasonDixon line to repeal the death penalty.
0225	O'MALLEY	I feel a responsibility every day to find things that work...
0226	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0227	HOLT	All right.
0228	HOLT	Let's talk...
0229	O'MALLEY	... and to do more of them to reform our criminal justice system.
0230	HOLT	Let's talk more about policing and the criminal justice system.
0231	HOLT	Senator Sanders, a few times tonight we're going to hear from some of the most prominent voices on YouTube, starting with Franchesca Ramsey, who tackles racial stereotypes through her videos.
0232	HOLT	Let's watch.
0233	SYSTEM	[ begin video clip ]
0234	FRANCHESCA RAMSEY	Hey, I'm Franchesca Ramsey.
0235	FRANCHESCA RAMSEY	I believe there's a huge conflict of interest when local prosecutors investigate cases of police violence within their own communities.
0236	FRANCHESCA RAMSEY	For example, last month, the officers involved in the case of 12 yearold Tamir Rice weren't indicted.
0237	FRANCHESCA RAMSEY	How would your presidency ensure that incidents of police violence are investigated and prosecuted fairly?
0238	SYSTEM	[ end video clip ]
0239	HOLT	Senator Sanders.
0240	SANDERS	I apologize for not hearing all of that question.
0241	HOLT	Would you like me to read it back to you?
0242	SANDERS	Yes.
0243	HOLT	Prosecutors  "I believe there's a huge conflict of interest when local prosecutors investigate cases of police violence within their communities.
0244	HOLT	Most recently, we saw this with a non indictment of the officers involved in the case of 12yearold Tamir Rice.
0245	HOLT	How would you presidency ensure incidents of police violence are investigated and prosecuted fairly?"
0246	SANDERS	Absolutely.
0247	SANDERS	This is a responsibility for the U.S. Justice Department to get involved.
0248	SANDERS	Whenever anybody in this country is killed while in police custody, it should automatically trigger a U.S. attorney general's investigation.
0249	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0250	SANDERS	Second of all, and I speak as a mayor who worked very closely and well with police officers, the vast majority of whom are honest, hard working people trying to do a difficult job, but let us be clear.
0251	SANDERS	If a police officer breaks the law, like any public official, that officer must be held accountable.
0252	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0253	SANDERS	And thirdly, we have got to demilitarize our police departments so they don't look like occupying armies.
0254	SANDERS	We've got to move toward community policing.
0255	SANDERS	And fourthly, we have got to make our police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity.
0256	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0257	HOLT	Secretary Clinton, this question is for you.
0258	HOLT	Tonight parts of America are in the grip of a deadly heroin epidemic, spanning race and class, hitting small towns and cities alike.
0259	HOLT	It has become a major issue in this race.
0260	HOLT	In a lot of places where you've been campaigning, despite an estimated trillion dollars spent, many say the war on drugs has failed.
0261	HOLT	So what would you do?
0262	CLINTON	Well, Lester, you're right.
0263	CLINTON	Everywhere I go to campaign, I'm meeting families who are affected by the drug problem that mostly is opioids and heroin now, and lives are being lost and children are being orphaned.
0264	CLINTON	And I've met a lot of grandparents who are now taking care of grandchildren.
0265	CLINTON	So I have tried to come out with a comprehensive approach that, number one, does tell the states that we will work with you from the federal government putting more money, about a billion dollars a year, to help states have a different approach to dealing with this epidemic.
0266	CLINTON	The policing needs to change.
0267	CLINTON	Police officers must be equipped with the antidote to a heroin overdose or an opioid overdose, known as Narcan.
0268	CLINTON	They should be able to administer it.
0269	CLINTON	So should firefighters and others.
0270	CLINTON	We have to move away from treating the use of drugs as a crime and instead, move it to where it belongs, as a health issue.
0271	CLINTON	And we need to divert more people from the criminal justice system into drug courts, into treatment, and recovery.
0272	HOLT	And that's time.
0273	CLINTON	So this is the kind of approach that we should take in dealing with what is now...
0274	HOLT	Senator...
0275	CLINTON	... a growing epidemic.
0276	HOLT	Senator Sanders, would you like to respond?
0277	SANDERS	Sure.
0278	SANDERS	I agree...
0279	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0280	SANDERS	I agree with everything the Secretary said, but let me just add this, there is a responsibility on the part of the pharmaceutical industry and the drug companies who are producing all of these drugs and not looking at the consequence of it.
0281	SANDERS	And second of all, when we talk about addiction being a disease, the Secretary is right, what that means is we need a revolution in this country in terms of mental health treatment.
0282	SANDERS	People should be able to get the treatment that they need when they need it, not two months from now, which is why I believe in universal...
0283	HOLT	That's...
0284	SANDERS	... healthcare with mental health...
0285	HOLT	... time.
0286	SANDERS	... a part of that.
0287	HOLT	We're going to get into all that coming up.
0288	O'MALLEY	Lester, just ten seconds.
0289	HOLT	But we're going to take a break and we need to take a break...
0290	O'MALLEY	Just 10 seconds.
0291	O'MALLEY	All of the things...
0292	HOLT	... and when we come back, the anger brewing in America.
0293	SYSTEM	[ commercial break ]
0294	HOLT	Welcome back to Charleston.
0295	HOLT	Let's turn to another area where there has been fierce disagreement  that would be health care.
0296	HOLT	Senator Sanders and Secretary Clinton, you both mentioned it in your 100day priorities.
0297	HOLT	Let's turn to my colleague, Andrea Mitchell now to lead that questioning.
0298	MITCHELL	Thank you, Lester.
0299	MITCHELL	Secretary Clinton, Senator Sanders favors what he calls "Medicare for all."
0300	MITCHELL	Now, you said that what he is proposing would tear up Obamacare and replace it.
0301	MITCHELL	Secretary Clinton, is it fair to say to say that Bernie Sanders wants to kill Obamacare?
0302	CLINTON	Well, Andrea, I am absolutely committed to universal health care.
0303	CLINTON	I have worked on this for a long time, people may remember that I took on the health insurance industry back in the '90s, and I didn't quit until we got the children's health insurance program that ensures eight million kids.
0304	CLINTON	And I certainly respect Senator Sanders' intentions, but when you're talking about health care, the details really matter.
0305	CLINTON	And therefore, we have been raising questions about the nine bills that he introduced over 20 years, as to how they would work and what would be the impact on people's health care?
0306	CLINTON	He didn't like that, his campaign didn't like it either.
0307	CLINTON	And tonight, he's come out with a new health care plan.
0308	CLINTON	And again, we need to get into the details.
0309	CLINTON	But here's what I believe, the Democratic Party and the United States worked since Harry Truman to get the Affordable Care Act passed.
0310	CLINTON	We finally have a path to universal health care.
0311	CLINTON	We have accomplished so much already.
0312	CLINTON	I do not to want see the Republicans repeal it, and I don't to want see us start over again with a contentious debate.
0313	CLINTON	I want us to defend and build on the Affordable Care Act and improve it.
0314	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0315	SANDERS	OK.
0316	MITCHELL	Senator Sanders?
0317	SANDERS	Secretary  Secretary Clinton didn't answer your question.
0318	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
0319	SANDERS	Because what her campaign was saying  Bernie Sanders, who has fought for universal health care for my entire life, he wants to end Medicare, end Medicaid, end the children's health insurance program.
0320	SANDERS	That is nonsense.
0321	SANDERS	What a Medicareforall program does is finally provide in this country health care for every man, woman and child as a right.
0322	SANDERS	Now, the truth is, that Frank Delano Roosevelt, Harry Truman, do you know what they believed in?
0323	SANDERS	They believed that health care should be available to all of our people.
0324	SANDERS	I'm on the committee that wrote the Affordable Care Act.
0325	SANDERS	I made the Affordable Care Act along with Jim Clyburn a better piece of legislation.
0326	SANDERS	I voted for it, but right now, what we have to deal with is the fact that 29 million people still have no health insurance.
0327	SANDERS	We are paying the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, getting ripped off.
0328	SANDERS	And here's the important point, we are spending far more per person on health care than the people of any other country.
0329	SANDERS	My proposal, provide health care to all people, get private insurance out of health insurance, lower the cost of health care for middle class families by 5,000 bucks.
0330	SANDERS	That's the vision we need to take.
0331	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0332	CLINTON	But  Senator Sanders, if I can...
0333	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0334	CLINTON	You know, I have to say I'm not sure whether we're talking about the plan you just introduced tonight, or we're talking about the plan you introduced nine times in the Congress.
0335	CLINTON	But the fact is, we have the Affordable Care Act.
0336	CLINTON	That is one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama, of the Democratic Party, and of our country.
0337	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0338	CLINTON	And we have already seen 19 million Americans get insurance.
0339	CLINTON	We have seen the end of preexisting conditions keeping people from getting insurance.
0340	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0341	CLINTON	We have seen women no longer paying more for our insurance than men.
0342	CLINTON	And we have seen young people, up to the age of 26, being able to stay on their parent's policy.
0343	SANDERS	But  what if we have...
0344	CLINTON	Now, there are things we can do to improve it, but to tear it up and start over again, pushing our country back into that kind of a contentious debate, I think is the wrong direction.
0345	SANDERS	It is  it is absolutely inaccurate.
0346	O'MALLEY	I have to talk about something that's actually working in our state.
0347	MITCHELL	Governor  Governor Sanders...
0348	SANDERS	No one is tearing this up, we're going to go forward.
0349	SANDERS	But with the secretary neglected to mention, not just the 29 million still have no health insurance, that even more are underinsured with huge copayments and deductibles.
0350	SANDERS	Tell me why we are spending almost three times more than the British, who guarantee health care to all of their people?
0351	SANDERS	Fifty percent more than the French, more than the Canadians.
0352	SANDERS	The vision from FDR and Harry Truman was health care for all people as a right in a costeffective way.
0353	SANDERS	We're not going to tear up the Affordable Care Act.
0354	SANDERS	I helped write it.
0355	SANDERS	But we are going to move on top of that to a Medicaidforall system.
0356	O'MALLEY	Andrea  Andrea  Andrea.
0357	O'MALLEY	[
0358	O'MALLEY	crosstalk ]
0359	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0360	O'MALLEY	Instead of  Andrea, I think, instead of attacking one another on health care, we should be talking about the things that are actually working.
0361	O'MALLEY	In our state, we have moved to an allpayer system.
0362	O'MALLEY	With the Affordable Care Act, we now have moved all of our acute care hospitals, that driver of cost at the center, away from feefor service.
0363	O'MALLEY	And actually to pay, we pay them based on how well they keep patients out of the hospital.
0364	O'MALLEY	How well they keep their patients.
0365	O'MALLEY	That's the future.
0366	O'MALLEY	We need to build on the Affordable Care Act, do the things that work, and reduce costs and increase access.
0367	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
0368	CLINTON	And that's exactly what we are able to do based on the foundation of the Affordable Care Act  what Governor O'Malley just said is one of the models that we will be looking at to make sure we do get costs down, we do limit a lot of the unnecessary costs that we still have in the system.
0369	CLINTON	But, with all due respect, to start over again with a whole new debate is something that I think would set us back.
0370	CLINTON	The Republicans just voted last week to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and thank goodness, President Obama vetoed it and saved Obamacare for the American people.
0371	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0372	MITCHELL	Senator Sanders, let me ask you this, though...
0373	SANDERS	Yeah.
0374	MITCHELL	... you've talked about Medicare for all...
0375	SANDERS	Yes.
0376	MITCHELL	.. and tonight you've released a very detailed plan, just two...
0377	SANDERS	Not all that detailed.
0378	MITCHELL	... well, two hours before the debate, you did.
0379	SANDERS	Well.
0380	MITCHELL	But let me ask you about Vermont.
0381	MITCHELL	Because in Vermont  you tried in the state of Vermont, and Vermont walked away from this kind of idea, of  of Medicare for all, singlepayer, because they concluded it would require major tax increases...
0382	SANDERS	Well, that's  you might want to ask...
0383	MITCHELL	... and by some estimates, it would double the budget.
0384	MITCHELL	If you couldn't sell it in Vermont, Senator...
0385	SANDERS	Andrea, let me just say this.
0386	MITCHELL	... how can you sell it to the country?
0387	SANDERS	Let me just say that you might want to ask the governor of the state of Vermont why he could not do it.
0388	SANDERS	I'm not the governor.
0389	SANDERS	I'm the senator from the state of Vermont.
0390	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
0391	SANDERS	But second of all  second of all...
0392	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0393	SANDERS	... here is what the real point is, in terms of all of the issues you've raised  the good questions you've raised.
0394	SANDERS	You know what it all comes down to?
0395	SANDERS	Do you know why we can't do what every other country  major country on Earth is doing?
0396	SANDERS	It's because we have a campaign finance system that is corrupt, we have super PACs, we have the pharmaceutical industry pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into campaign contributions and lobbying, and the private insurance companies as well.
0397	SANDERS	What this is really about is not the rational way to go forward  it's Medicare for all  it is whether we have the guts to stand up to the private insurance companies and all of their money, and the pharmaceutical industry.
0398	SANDERS	That's what this debate should be about.
0399	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0400	CLINTON	Well, as someone who  as someone who has a little bit of experience standing up to the health insurance industry, that spent, you know...
0401	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0402	CLINTON	...many, many millions of dollars attacking me, and probably will so again, because of what I believe we can do building on the Affordable Care Act, I think it's important to point out that there are a lot of reasons we have the health care system we have today.
0403	CLINTON	I know how much money influences the political decisionmaking.
0404	CLINTON	That's why I'm for huge campaign finance reform.
0405	CLINTON	However, we started a system that had private health insurance.
0406	CLINTON	And even during the Affordable Care Act debate, there was an opportunity to vote for what was called the public option.
0407	CLINTON	In other words, people could buy in to Medicare, and even when the Democrats were in charge of the Congress, we couldn't get the votes for that.
0408	CLINTON	So, what I'm saying is really simple.
0409	CLINTON	This has been the fight of the Democratic Party for decades.
0410	CLINTON	We have the Affordable Care Act.
0411	CLINTON	Let's make it work.
0412	CLINTON	Let's take the models that states are doing.
0413	CLINTON	We now have driven costs down to the lowest they've been in 50 years.
0414	CLINTON	Now we've got to get individual costs down.
0415	CLINTON	That's what I'm planning to do.
0416	HOLT	And that's time.
0417	HOLT	We're gonna take a turn now.
0418	HOLT	Secretary Clinton, in his final State of the Union address, President Obama said his biggest regret was his inability to bring the country together.
0419	HOLT	If President Obama couldn't do it, how will you?
0420	O'MALLEY	Great question.
0421	CLINTON	Well, I think it's an important point the president made in his State of the Union.
0422	CLINTON	And here's what I would say.
0423	CLINTON	I will go anywhere, to meet with anyone, at any time to find common ground.
0424	CLINTON	That's what I did as a first lady, when I worked with both Democrats and Republicans to get the Children's Health Insurance Program, when I worked with Tom DeLay, one of the most partisan of Republicans, to reform the adoption and foster care system.
0425	CLINTON	What I did, working in the Senate, where I crossed the aisle often, working even with the senator from South Carolina, Lindsey Graham, to get Tricare for national guardsmen and women.
0426	CLINTON	And it's what I did as Secretary of State, on numerous occasions, and most particularly, rounding up twothirds votes in order to pass a treaty that lowered the nuclear weapons in both Russia and the United States.
0427	CLINTON	So I know it's hard, but I also know you've got to work at it every single day.
0428	CLINTON	I look out here, I see a lot of my friends from the Congress.
0429	CLINTON	And I know that they work at it every single day.
0430	CLINTON	Because maybe you can't only find a little sliver of common ground to cooperate with somebody from the other party, but who knows.
0431	CLINTON	If you're successful there, maybe you can build even more.
0432	CLINTON	That's what I would do.
0433	HOLT	That's time.
0434	HOLT	Senator Sanders, response.
0435	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0436	SANDERS	A couple of years ago, when we understood that veterans were not getting the quality care they needed in the timely manner, I worked with folks like John McCain and others to pass the most comprehensive veteran's health care legislation in modern history.
0437	SANDERS	But let me rephrase your question because I think, in all do respect, you're expression.
0438	SANDERS	In all do respect, you're missing the main point.
0439	SANDERS	And the main point in the Congress, it's not the Republicans and Democrats hate each other.
0440	SANDERS	That's a mythology from the media.
0441	SANDERS	The real issue is that Congress is owned by big money and refuses to do what the American people want them to do.
0442	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0443	SANDERS	The real issue is that in area after area, raising the minimum wage to $15 bucks an hour.
0444	SANDERS	The American people want it.
0445	SANDERS	Rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, creating 13 million jobs, the American people want it.
0446	SANDERS	The pay equity for women, the American people want it.
0447	SANDERS	Demanding that the wealthy start paying their fair share of taxes.
0448	SANDERS	The American people want it.
0449	HOLT	That's time.
0450	HOLT	But let me continue with the...
0451	SANDERS	The point is, we have to make Congress respond to the needs of the people, not big money.
0452	HOLT	Senator Sanders, let me continue, you call yourself a Democratic socialist...
0453	SANDERS	I do.
0454	HOLT	And throughout your career in politics, you've been critical of the Democratic party, you've been saying in a book you wrote, quote, "There wasn't a hell of a big difference between the the two major parties."
0455	HOLT	How would you will a general election...
0456	SANDERS	Did I say that?
0457	HOLT	How will you win a general election labeling yourself a democratic socialist?
0458	SANDERS	Because of what I believe in what I was just saying.
0459	SANDERS	The Democratic party needs major reform.
0460	SANDERS	To those of you in South Carolina, you know what, in Mississippi, we need a 50state strategy so that people in South Carolina and Mississippi can get the resources that they need.
0461	SANDERS	Instead of being dependent on super PACs, what we need is to be dependent on small, individual campaign contributors.
0462	SANDERS	We need an agenda that speaks to the needs of working families and lowincome people.
0463	SANDERS	Not wealthy campaign contributors.
0464	HOLT	Yes, but senator, you can...
0465	SANDERS	We need to expand what the input into the Democratic party.
0466	SANDERS	I am very proud that in this campaign, we have seen an enormous amount of excitement from young people, from working people.
0467	SANDERS	We have received more individual contributions than any candidate in the history of this country up to this point.
0468	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0469	O'MALLEY	Yes, but senator you never came to campaign for Vincent Sheheen when he was running for governor.
0470	O'MALLEY	In fact, neither of you came to campaign for Vincent Sheheen when he was running for governor.
0471	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0472	O'MALLEY	We can talk all we want about wanting to build a stronger Democratic party, but Lester, the question you answered, it's no laughing matter.
0473	O'MALLEY	The most recurring question I get when I stand on the chair all across Iowa and talk with my neighbors is, how are you going to heal the divisions and the wounds in our country?
0474	O'MALLEY	This is the biggest challenge we face as a people.
0475	O'MALLEY	All my life, I brought people together over deep divides and very old wounds, and that's what we need now in a new leader.
0476	O'MALLEY	We cannot keep talking past each other, declaring all Republicans are our enemies or the war is all about being against millionaires or billionaires, or it's all against American Muslims, all against immigrants.
0477	O'MALLEY	Look, as Frederick Douglas said, we are one, our cause is one, and we must help each other if we are going to succeed.
0478	HOLT	And that is right.
0479	SANDERS	And I respectfully disagree.
0480	HOLT	Secretary Clinton, our next question is for you.
0481	HOLT	Here's another quantitative problem.
0482	SANDERS	And I respectfully disagree with my friend over here.
0483	SANDERS	And that is, you are right.
0484	SANDERS	All of us have denounced Trump's attempts to divide this country the antiLatino rhetoric, the racist rhetoric, he antiMuslim rhetoric.
0485	SANDERS	But where I disagree with you, Governor O'Malley, is I do believe we have to deal with the fundamental issues of a handful of billionaires...
0486	O'MALLEY	I agree with that.
0487	SANDERS	... who control economic and political life of this country.
0488	O'MALLEY	I agree.
0489	SANDERS	Nothing real will get happened.
0490	SANDERS	Unless we have a political revolution.
0491	SANDERS	Where millions of people finally stand up.
0492	HOLT	And we're going to get into that coming up.
0493	HOLT	But Secretary Clinton, here's a question from YouTube.
0494	HOLT	It's from a young video blogger who has over 5 million subscribers.
0495	HOLT	He has a question about the importance of younger voters.
0496	SYSTEM	[ begin video clip ]
0497	FRANTA	Hi, I'm Connor Franta, I'm 23 and my audience is around the same age.
0498	FRANTA	Getting my generation to vote should be a priority for any presidential candidate.
0499	FRANTA	Now I know Senator Sanders is pretty popular among my peers, but what I want to know is, how are all of you planning on engaging us further in this election?
0500	SYSTEM	[ end video clip ]
0501	HOLT	Secretary Clinton.
0502	CLINTON	Well thanks for the question and congratulations on five million viewers on YouTube, that's quite an accomplishment.
0503	CLINTON	Look, this election is mostly about the future and therefore it is of greatest urgency for young people.
0504	CLINTON	I've laid out my ideas about what we can do to make college affordable how we can help people pay off their student debts and save thousands of dollars, how we can create more good jobs because a lot of the young people that I talk with are pretty disappointed the economic prospects they feel their facing.
0505	CLINTON	So making community college free, making it possible to attend a public college or university with debt free tuition, looking for ways to protect our rights especially from the concerted Republican assault on voting rights, on women's rights, on gay rights, on civil rights, on workers rights.
0506	CLINTON	And I know how much young people value their independence, their autonomy, and their rights.
0507	CLINTON	So I think this is an election where we have to pull young people and older people together to have a strategy about how we're going to encourage even more American's to vote because it absolutely clear to me...
0508	HOLT	That's time...
0509	CLINTON	That turning over our White House to the Republicans would be bad for everybody especially young people.
0510	HOLT	A quick follow up  a thirty second follow up.
0511	HOLT	Why is Senator Sanders beating you to 2 to 1 among younger votes?
0512	CLINTON	Look, I have the greatest respect for Senator Sanders and for his supports and I'm going to keep working as hard as I can to reach as many people of all ages about what I will do, what the experience and the ideas that I have that I will bring to the White House and I hope to have their support when I'm the Democratic nominee.
0513	HOLT	We're going to take...
0514	SANDERS	Is that your strategy...
0515	HOLT	We're going to take a break.
0516	HOLT	When we come back big banks, big business and big differences among the three candidates on the American Economy.
0517	HOLT	We'll be right back.
0518	SYSTEM	[ commercial break ]
0519	HOLT	Welcome back from Charleston.
0520	HOLT	Let's turn now to the economy.
0521	HOLT	Senator Sanders, you released a tough new ad last week in which without mentioning Secretary Clinton by name, you talk about two Democratic visions for regulating Wall Street.
0522	HOLT	One says it's OK to take millions from big banks and tell them what to do.
0523	HOLT	My plan, break up the big banks, close the tax loopholes and make them pay their fair share.
0524	HOLT	What do you see as the difference between what you would do about the banks and what Secretary Clinton would do?
0525	SANDERS	Well, the first difference is I don't take money from big banks.
0526	SANDERS	I don't get personal speaking fees from Goldman Sachs.
0527	SANDERS	What I would do...
0528	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0529	SANDERS	What I would do is understand that when you have three out of the four largest banks today, bigger than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have the six largest financial institutions having assets of 60 percent of the GDP of America, it is very clear to me what you have to do.
0530	SANDERS	You've got to bring back the 21st century GlassSteagall legislation and you've got to break up these huge financial institutions.
0531	SANDERS	They have too much economic power and they have too much financial power over our entire economy.
0532	SANDERS	If Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, the old Republican trust buster, what he would say is these guys are too powerful.
0533	SANDERS	Break them up.
0534	SANDERS	I believe that's what the American people to want see.
0535	SANDERS	That's my view.
0536	HOLT	Secretary Clinton, help the voter understand the daylight between the two of you here.
0537	CLINTON	Well, there's no daylight on the basic premise that there should be no bank too big to fail and no individual too powerful to jail.
0538	CLINTON	We agree on that.
0539	CLINTON	But where we disagree is the comments that Senator Sanders has made that don't just affect me, I can take that, but he's criticized President Obama for taking donations from Wall Street, and President Obama has led our country out of the great recession.
0540	CLINTON	Senator Sanders called him weak, disappointing.
0541	CLINTON	He even, in 2011, publicly sought someone to run in a primary against President Obama.
0542	CLINTON	Now, I personally believe that President Obama's work to push through the DoddFrank...
0543	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
0544	CLINTON	The DoddFrank bill and then to sign it was one of the most important regulatory schemes we've had since the 1930s.
0545	CLINTON	So I'm going to defend DoddFrank and I'm going to defend President Obama for taking on Wall Street, taking on the financial industry and getting results.
0546	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0547	SANDERS	OK. First of all...
0548	HOLT	Senator Sanders, your response.
0549	SANDERS	Set the record right.
0550	SANDERS	In 2006 when I ran for the Senate, Senator Barack Obama was kind enough to campaign for me, 2008, I did my best to see that he was elected and in 2012, I worked as hard as I could to see that he was reelected.
0551	SANDERS	He and I are friends.
0552	SANDERS	We've worked together on many issues.
0553	SANDERS	We have some differences of opinion.
0554	SANDERS	But here is the issue, Secretary touched on it, can you really reform Wall Street when they are spending millions and millions of dollars on campaign contributions and when they are providing speaker fees to individuals?
0555	SANDERS	So it's easy to say, well, I'm going to do this and do that, but I have doubts when people receive huge amounts of money from Wall Street.
0556	SANDERS	I am very proud, I do not have a super PAC.
0557	SANDERS	I do not want Wall Street's money.
0558	SANDERS	I'll rely on the middle class and working families...
0559	HOLT	That's time.
0560	HOLT	Governor O'Malley...
0561	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
0562	SANDERS	... campaign contributions.
0563	HOLT	I have a question for you...
0564	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0565	CLINTON	You know, I think since  since Senator Standers followed up on this...
0566	HOLT	Thirtysecond response.
0567	CLINTON	Your profusion of comments about your feelings towards President Obama are a little strange given what you said about him in 2011.
0568	CLINTON	But look, I have a plan that most commentators have said is tougher, more effective, and more comprehensive.
0569	O'MALLEY	That's not true.
0570	CLINTON	It builds on the DoddFrank  yes, it is.
0571	CLINTON	It builds on the DoddFrank, regulatory scheme...
0572	O'MALLEY	It's just not true.
0573	CLINTON	... but it goes much further, because...
0574	O'MALLEY	Oh, come on.
0575	CLINTON	... both the governor and the senator have focused only on the big banks.
0576	CLINTON	Lehman Brothers, AIG, the shadow banking sector were as big a problem in what caused the Great Recession, I go after them.
0577	CLINTON	And I can tell you that the hedge fund billionaires who are running ads against me right now, and Karl Rove, who started running an ad against me right now, funded by money from the financial services sector, sure thing, I'm the one they don't want to be up against.
0578	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0579	HOLT	Governor O'Malley.
0580	O'MALLEY	Yes, thank you.
0581	O'MALLEY	Yes, Lester, what Secretary Clinton just said is actually not true.
0582	O'MALLEY	What  I have put forward a plan that would actually put cops back on the beat of Wall Street.
0583	O'MALLEY	I have put forward a plan that was heralded as very comprehensive and realistic.
0584	O'MALLEY	Look, if a bank robber robs a bank and all you do is slap him on the wrist, he's just going to keep robbing banks again.
0585	O'MALLEY	The same thing is true with people in suits.
0586	O'MALLEY	Secretary Clinton, I have a tremendous amount of respect for you, but for you to say there's no daylight on this between the three of us is also not true.
0587	O'MALLEY	I support reinstituting a modern version of Glass Steagall that would include going after the shadow banks, requiring capital requirements that would force them to no longer put us on the hook for these sorts of things.
0588	O'MALLEY	In prior debates I've heard you even bring up  I mean, now you bring up President Obama here in South Carolina in defense of the fact of your cozy relationship with Wall Street.
0589	O'MALLEY	In an earlier debate, I heard you bring up even the 911 victims to defend it.
0590	O'MALLEY	The truth of the matter is, Secretary Clinton, you do not go as far as reining in Wall Street as I would.
0591	O'MALLEY	And the fact of the matter is, the people of America deserve to have a president that's on their side, protecting the main street economy from excesses on Wall Street.
0592	O'MALLEY	And we're just as vulnerable today.
0593	HOLT	Secretary Clinton, 30second response.
0594	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0595	CLINTON	Yes, well, first of all  first of all, Paul Krugman, Barney Frank, others have all endorsed my plan.
0596	CLINTON	Secondly, we have DoddFrank.
0597	CLINTON	It gives us the authority already to break up big banks that pose...
0598	O'MALLEY	And we have never used it.
0599	CLINTON	That pose a risk to the financial sector.
0600	CLINTON	I want to go further and add to that.
0601	CLINTON	And, you know, Governor, you have raised money on Wall Street.
0602	CLINTON	You raised a lot of money on Wall Street when you were the head of the Democratic Governor's Association...
0603	O'MALLEY	Yes, but I haven't gotten a penny this year...
0604	CLINTON	And you were...
0605	O'MALLEY	... so somebody please, go on to martinomalley.com...
0606	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
0607	O'MALLEY	.
0608	O'MALLEY	Go on to martinomalley.com, send me your checks.
0609	O'MALLEY	They're not giving me  zero.
0610	CLINTON	Yes, well, the point is that if we're going to be serious about this and not just try to score political points, we should know what's in DoddFrank, and what's in DoddFrank already gives the president the authority...
0611	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
0612	CLINTON	...with his regulators to make those decisions.
0613	SANDERS	Let me give you an example of how corrupt  how corrupt this system is.
0614	SANDERS	Goldman Sachs recently fined $5 billion.
0615	SANDERS	Goldman Sachs has given this country two secretaries of treasury, one on the Republicans, one under Democrats.
0616	O'MALLEY	Say it.
0617	SANDERS	The leader of Goldman Sachs is a billionaire who comes to Congress and tells us we should cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.
0618	SANDERS	Secretary Clinton  and you're not the only one, so I don't mean to just point the finger at you, you've received over $600,000 in speaking fees from Goldman Sachs in one year.
0619	SANDERS	I find it very strange that a major financial institution that pays $5 billion in fines for breaking the law, not one of their executives is prosecuted, while kids who smoke marijuana get a jail sentence.
0620	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0621	HOLT	That's time.
0622	HOLT	Andrea.
0623	CLINTON	Well, the last point on this is, Senator Sanders, you're the only one on this stage that voted to deregulate the financial market in 2000, to take the cops off the street, to use Governor O'Malley's phrase, to make the SEC and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission no longer able to regulate swaps and derivatives, which were one of the main cause of the collapse in '08.
0624	CLINTON	So there's plenty...
0625	SANDERS	If you want to...
0626	CLINTON	There's plenty of problems that we all have to face together.
0627	CLINTON	And the final thing I would say, we're at least having a vigorous debate about reining in Wall Street...
0628	HOLT	...
0629	HOLT	Senator...
0630	CLINTON	...
0631	CLINTON	The Republicans want to give them more power, and repeal DoddFrank.
0632	CLINTON	That's what we need to stop...
0633	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0634	SANDERS	Anyone who wants to check my record in taking on Wall Street, in fighting against the deregulation of Wall Street when Wall Street put billions of dollars in lobbying, in campaign contributions to get the government off their backs.
0635	SANDERS	They got the government off their backs.
0636	SANDERS	Turns out that they were crooks, and they destroyed our economy.
0637	SANDERS	I think it's time to put the government back on their backs.
0638	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0639	MITCHELL	Senator Sanders  Senator Sanders, you've talked a lot about things you want to do.
0640	MITCHELL	You want free education for everyone, you want the Federal Minimum Wage raised to $15 an hour.
0641	MITCHELL	You want to expand Social Security...
0642	SANDERS	... Yeah...
0643	MITCHELL	... benefits.
0644	MITCHELL	You've been specific about what you want, but let's talk about how to pay for all this.
0645	MITCHELL	You now said that you would raise taxes today, two hours or so ago, you said you would raise taxes to pay for your health care plan.
0646	MITCHELL	You haven't been specific about how to pay for the other things...
0647	SANDERS	... That's true.
0648	MITCHELL	... Will you tell us tonight?
0649	SANDERS	Good.
0650	SANDERS	You're right.
0651	SANDERS	I want to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, create 13 million jobs.
0652	SANDERS	We do that by doing away with the absurd loophole that now allows major profitable corporations to stash their money in the Cayman Islands, and not in some years, pay a nickel in taxes.
0653	SANDERS	Yes, I do.
0654	SANDERS	I plead guilty.
0655	SANDERS	I want every kid in this country who has the ability to be able to go to a public college, or university, tuition free.
0656	SANDERS	And, by the way, I want to substantially lower student debt interest rates in this country as well.
0657	SANDERS	How do I pay for it?
0658	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0659	SANDERS	I pay for it through a tax on Wall Street speculation.
0660	SANDERS	This country, and the middle class, bailed out Wall Street.
0661	SANDERS	Now, it is Wall Street's time to help the middle class.
0662	SANDERS	In fact...
0663	SYSTEM	[ inaudible ]
0664	SANDERS	... we have documented, unlike Secretary Clinton, I have documented exactly how I would pay for our ambitious agenda.
0665	O'MALLEY	Andrea...
0666	MITCHELL	... OK...
0667	O'MALLEY	...
0668	O'MALLEY	The only person on this stage who has...
0669	MITCHELL	... Secretary Clinton, you mentioned earlier  Secretary Clinton, do you want to respond?
0670	CLINTON	Well, I have actually documented every way that I'm going to pay for what I'm doing because I think the American public deserves to know.
0671	CLINTON	And, you can go to my website and actually see that.
0672	CLINTON	But, there are serious questions about how we're going to pay for what we want to see our country do.
0673	CLINTON	And, I'm the only candidate standing here tonight who has said I will not raise taxes on the middle class.
0674	CLINTON	I want to raise incomes, not taxes, and I'm going to do everything I can to make sure that the wealthy pay for debt free tuition, for child care, for paid family leave.
0675	CLINTON	To help us bring down student debt we're going to refinance that student debt, saving kids thousands of dollars.
0676	CLINTON	Yeah, and that will also come out of the  some of the pockets of people in the financial services industry...
0677	MITCHELL	OK, we're out of time.
0678	MITCHELL	Senator Sanders,
0679	CLINTON	But I will tell you exactly how I pay for everything I've proposed...
0680	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
0681	MITCHELL	Senator Sanders...
0682	SANDERS	...
0683	SANDERS	Here is the main two points...
0684	MITCHELL	...
0685	MITCHELL	Senator Sanders, let me ask you a question about taxes.
0686	SANDERS	Yeah.
0687	MITCHELL	The most googled political issue...
0688	SANDERS	...
0689	SANDERS	I got it.
0690	MITCHELL	In the last month was taxes.
0691	MITCHELL	Now, in your healthcare plan, the plan you released tonight, you would not only raise taxes on the wealthy, but the details you released indicate you would raise taxes on the middle class also.
0692	MITCHELL	Is that correct?
0693	SANDERS	What is correct, and I'm disappointed that Secretary Clinton's campaign has made this criticism.
0694	SANDERS	It's a Republican criticism.
0695	SANDERS	Secretary Clinton does know a lot about healthcare, and she understands, I believe, that a medicare for all, single payer program will substantially lower the cost of healthcare for middle class families.
0696	SANDERS	So, what we have got to acknowledge, and I hope the Secretary does, is we are doing away with private health insurance premiums.
0697	SANDERS	So, instead of paying $10,000 dollars to Blue Cross, or Blue Shield, yes, some middle class families would be paying slightly more in taxes, but the result would be that that middle class family would be saving some $5,000 dollars in healthcare costs.
0698	SANDERS	A little bit more in taxes, do away with private health insurance premiums.
0699	SANDERS	It's a pretty good deal.
0700	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0701	MITCHELL	Senator  Senator, let me just follow up on that.
0702	SANDERS	Yeah.
0703	MITCHELL	On Meet the Press on December 20th, you said that you would only raise taxes on the middle class to pay for family leave.
0704	MITCHELL	And, having said that, now you say you're going to raise middle class taxes to pay for healthcare as well.
0705	MITCHELL	Is that breaking your word?
0706	SANDERS	No, it is not breaking my word.
0707	SANDERS	When you are  it's one thing to say I'm raising taxes, it's another thing to say that we are doing away with private health insurance premiums.
0708	SANDERS	So, if I save you $10,000 in private health insurance, and you pay a little bit more in taxes in total, there are huge savings in what your family is spending.
0709	O'MALLEY	Senator, I'm the only person on this stage that's actually balanced a budget every year for 15 years.
0710	SANDERS	I was mayor for eight years, I did that as well.
0711	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
0712	O'MALLEY	OK.
0713	O'MALLEY	So, that was eight years.
0714	O'MALLEY	Yes.
0715	O'MALLEY	And Senator, but I actually did it during a budget down time  I mean, during a recession.
0716	O'MALLEY	And Andrea, the  I had to make more cuts than any governor in the history of Maryland, but we invested more in infrastructure, more in transportation.
0717	O'MALLEY	We made our public schools more in America more than five years in a row, and went four years in a row without a penny's increase to college tuition.
0718	O'MALLEY	The things that we need to do in our country, like debtfree college in the next five years, like making universal  like making national service a universal option in order to cut youth unemployment in half in the next three years, all these things can be done if we eliminate one entitlement we can no longer afford as a nation.
0719	O'MALLEY	And that is the wealthy among us, those making more than a million dollars, feel that they are entitled to paying a much lower marginal tax rate than was usual for the better part of these 80 years.
0720	O'MALLEY	And if we tax earnings from investments on money  namely capital gains  at the same rate as we tax sweat and hard work and toil, we can make the investments we need to make to make our country better.
0721	HOLT	We have got a lot to ground to cover here.
0722	HOLT	Many Democratic voters are passionate about the need to do something to combat the threat of climate change, including the team of scientists from Youtube's MinuteEarth channel.
0723	HOLT	Here's their take.
0724	SYSTEM	[ begin video clip ]
0725	ANNOUNCER	Hello from MinuteEarth.
0726	ANNOUNCER	Fossil fuels have long kept our cars moving and our light bulbs lit.
0727	ANNOUNCER	But we know that burning these fuels releases heattrapping gases that are warming the planet, causing seas to rise and contributing to extreme weather events, like South Carolina's devastating flooding last year.
0728	ANNOUNCER	Fighting humancaused climate change means giving up our global addiction to fossil fuels and shifting the bulk of the world's energy supply to alternative sources.
0729	ANNOUNCER	Some countries have acted decisively to make this transition.
0730	ANNOUNCER	But here at home, we still get a whooping 82 percent of our energy from coal, oil, and natural gas.
0731	ANNOUNCER	In the U.S., political gridlock, pressure from industry lobbyists and insufficient RD have made an already tough battle against climate change even tougher.
0732	SYSTEM	[ end video clip ]
0733	HOLT	Senator Sanders, Americans love their SUVs, which spiked in sales last year as gas prices plummeted.
0734	HOLT	How do you convince Americans that the problem of climate change is so urgent that they need to change their behavior?
0735	SANDERS	I think we already are.
0736	SANDERS	Younger generation understands it instinctively.
0737	SANDERS	I was home in Burlington, Vermont, on Christmas Eve, the temperature was 65 degrees.
0738	SANDERS	People in Vermont know what's going on.
0739	SANDERS	People who did ice fishing, where their ice is no longer there on the lake understand what's going on.
0740	SANDERS	I'm on both the Environmental and Energy Committees.
0741	SANDERS	The debate is over.
0742	SANDERS	Climate change is real.
0743	SANDERS	It is already causing major problems.
0744	SANDERS	And if we do not act boldly and decisively, a bad situation will become worse.
0745	SANDERS	It is amazing to me, and I think we'll have agreement on this up here, that we have a major party, called the Republican Party that is so owned by the fossil fuel industry and their campaign contributions that they don't even have the courage, the decency to listen to the scientists.
0746	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0747	SANDERS	It is beyond my comprehension how we can elect a president of the United States, somebody like Trump, who believes that climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese.
0748	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
0749	SANDERS	Bottom line is, we need to be bold and decisive, we can create millions of jobs.
0750	SANDERS	We must, for the sake of our kids and grandchildren, transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.
0751	SANDERS	I've got the most comprehensive legislation in the Senate to do that.
0752	SANDERS	And as president, I will fight to make that happen.
0753	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0754	HOLT	Governor O'Malley, 30 seconds.
0755	O'MALLEY	Thank you.
0756	O'MALLEY	Lester, on this stage tonight, this Democratic stage, where we actually believe in science.
0757	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
0758	O'MALLEY	I would like to challenge and invite my colleagues here on this stage to join me in putting forward a plan to move us to a 100 percent clean, electric energy grid by 2050.
0759	O'MALLEY	It can be done.
0760	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0761	O'MALLEY	With solar, with wind, with new technologies, with green buildings, this can happen, but in all  President Obama made us more energy independent, but in all of the above strategy didn't land us on the moon, we need American ingenuity and we need to reach by 2050 for the sake of our kids.
0762	HOLT	That's time.
0763	HOLT	We're going to take a break.
0764	CLINTON	And let me...
0765	HOLT	When we return, the latebreaking developments regarding Iran.
0766	HOLT	The threat of ISIS now more real than ever on U.S. soil.
0767	HOLT	Americans in fear and hearing few good answers.
0768	HOLT	We'll be right back.
0769	SYSTEM	[ commercial break ]
0770	HOLT	Charleston, Andrea Mitchell has questions now starting with Iran.
0771	MITCHELL	Thank you Lester.
0772	MITCHELL	Senator Sanders, the nuclear deal is now enforced.
0773	MITCHELL	Iran is getting it's billions of dollars, several Americans who have been held are now going to be heading home.
0774	MITCHELL	The president said today, "it's a good day.
0775	MITCHELL	It's a good day for diplomacy.
0776	MITCHELL	It's a time now to restore diplomatic relations for the first time since 1979 and actually re opened a U.S. Embassy in Tehran."
0777	SANDERS	I think what we've got to do is move as aggressively as we can to normalize relations with Iran.
0778	SANDERS	Understanding that Iran's behavior in so many ways is something that we disagree with their support terrorism, the antiAmerican rhetoric that we're hearing from of their leadership is something that is not acceptable.
0779	SANDERS	On the other hand, the fact that we've managed to reach an agreement, something that I've very strongly supported that prevents Iran from getting a nuclear weapon and we did that without going to war.
0780	SANDERS	And that I believe we're seeing a fall in our relationships with Iran is a very positive step.
0781	SANDERS	So if your question is, do I want to see that relationship become more positive in the future?
0782	SANDERS	Yes.
0783	SANDERS	Can I tell that we should open an embassy in Tehran tomorrow?
0784	SANDERS	No, I don't think we should.
0785	SANDERS	But I think the goal has go to be as we've done with Cuba, to move in warm relations with a very powerful and important country in this world.
0786	MITCHELL	Your response Secretary Clinton?
0787	CLINTON	Well, I'm very proud of the Iran Nuclear Agreement.
0788	CLINTON	I was very pleased to be part of what the president put into action when he took office.
0789	CLINTON	I was responsible for getting those sanctions imposed which put the pressure on Iran.
0790	CLINTON	It brought them to the negotiating table which resulted in this agreement.
0791	CLINTON	And so, they have been so far, following their requirements under the agreement.
0792	CLINTON	But I think we still have to carefully watch them.
0793	CLINTON	We've had one good day over 36 year and I think we need more good days before we move more rapidly toward any kind of normalization.
0794	CLINTON	And we have to be sure that they are truly going to implement the agreement.
0795	CLINTON	And then, we have to go after them on a lot of their other bad behavior in the region which is causing enormous problems in Syria, Yemen, Iraq and elsewhere.
0796	MITCHELL	You mentioned Syria.
0797	MITCHELL	Let me ask you about Syria, all of you.
0798	MITCHELL	Let's turn to Syria and the civil war that has been raging there.
0799	MITCHELL	Are there any circumstances in which you could see deploying significant numbers of ground forces in Syria, not just specials forces but significant ground forces to combat ISIS in a direct combat role?
0800	MITCHELL	Let me start with you Secretary Clinton.
0801	CLINTON	Absolutely not.
0802	CLINTON	I have a three point plan that does not include American Ground forces.
0803	CLINTON	It includes the United States leading an air coalition which is what we're doing, supporting fighters on the ground the Iraqi Army which is beginning to show more ability, the Sunni fighters that we are now helping to reconstitute and Kurdish on both sides of the border.
0804	CLINTON	I think we also have try to disrupt their supply chain of foreign fighters and foreign money and we do have to contest them in online space.
0805	CLINTON	So I'm very committed to both going after ISIS but also supporting what Secretary Kerry is doing to try to move on a political diplomatic to try to begin to slow down and hopefully end the carnage in Syria which is the root of so many of the problems that we seen in the region and beyond.
0806	MITCHELL	Senator Sanders, ground forces yes or no?
0807	SANDERS	As everybody you know, this is incredibly complicated and difficult issue and I applaud.
0808	SANDERS	I know President Obama's been getting a lot of criticism on this.
0809	SANDERS	I think he is doing the right thing.
0810	SANDERS	What the nightmare is, which many of my Republican colleagues appear to want is to not have learned the lesson of Iraq.
0811	SANDERS	To get American young men and women involved in perpetual warfare in the quagmire of Syria and the Middle East would be an unmitigated disaster that as president, I will do everything in my power to avoid.
0812	O'MALLEY	Andrea...
0813	MITCHELL	Governor O'Malley?
0814	SANDERS	We should  we should learn  we should learn from King Abdullah of Jordan, one of the few heroes in a very unheroic place.
0815	SANDERS	And what Abdullah said is this is a war with a soul of Islam and that Muslim troops should be on the ground with our support and the support of other major countries.
0816	SANDERS	That is how we destroy ISIS, not with American troops in perpetual warfare.
0817	MITCHELL	Governor O'Malley.
0818	O'MALLEY	Thank you.
0819	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0820	O'MALLEY	Andrea, governors have led us to victory in two world wars by doing what America does best, and that is by joining forces with others by acting in coalition.
0821	O'MALLEY	And I believe that President Obama is doing the right thing in this case.
0822	O'MALLEY	We need to learn the lessons from the past.
0823	O'MALLEY	We do need to provide the special  special ops advisers, we need  do need to provide the technical support, but over the longterm, we need to develop new alliances.
0824	O'MALLEY	We need a much more proactive national security strategy that reduces these threats before they rise to a level where it feels like we need to pull for a division of marines.
0825	O'MALLEY	And I also want to add one other thing here.
0826	O'MALLEY	I appreciate the fact that in our debate, we don't use the term you hear Republicans throwing around trying to look all vibrato and macho sending other kids  kids into combat, they keep using the term boots on the ground.
0827	O'MALLEY	A woman in Burlington, Iowa said to me, "Governor, when you're with your colleagues, please don't refer to my son who has served two tours of duty in Iraq as a pair of boots on the ground."
0828	O'MALLEY	Now, we need to be mindful of learning the lessons of the past.
0829	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0830	MITCHELL	I have a question.
0831	MITCHELL	I have a question for Senator Sanders.
0832	MITCHELL	Did the policies of the Obama administration, in which Secretary Clinton of course was a part, create a vacuum in Iraq and Syria that helped ISIS grow?
0833	SANDERS	No.
0834	SANDERS	I think the vacuum was created by the disastrous war in Iraq, which I vigorously opposed.
0835	SANDERS	Not only did I vote against it, I helped lead the opposition.
0836	SANDERS	And what happened there is yes, it's easy to get rid of a twobit dictator like Saddam Hussein, but there wasn't the kind of thought as to what happens the day after you get him and what kind of political vacuum occurs.
0837	SANDERS	And who rises up?
0838	SANDERS	Groups like ISIS.
0839	SANDERS	So I think that President Obama made a promise to the American people when he ran, and he said you know what, I'm going to do my best to bring American troops home.
0840	SANDERS	And I supported what he did.
0841	SANDERS	Our job is to train and provide military support for Muslim countries in the area who are prepared to take on ISIS.
0842	SANDERS	And one point I want to make here that is not made very often, you have incredibly wealthy countries in that region, countries like Saudi Arabia, countries like Qatar.
0843	SANDERS	Qatar happens to be the largest  wealthiest country per capita in the world.
0844	SANDERS	They have got to start putting in some skin in the game and not just ask the United States to do it.
0845	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0846	MITCHELL	Secretary Clinton, I want to talk to you about red lines, because former Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said in a recent interview that President Obama's decision to stand down on planned missile strikes against Damascus after Assad had used chemical weapons hurt the president's credibility.
0847	MITCHELL	Should the president have stuck to his red line once he drew it?
0848	CLINTON	Look, I think that the president's decision to go after the chemical weapons once there was a potential opportunity to build on when the Russians opened that door resulted in a very positive outcome.
0849	CLINTON	We were able to get the chemical weapons out.
0850	CLINTON	I know from my own experience as secretary of State that we were deeply worried about Assad's forces using chemical weapons because it would have had not only a horrific affect on people in Syria, but it could very well have affected the surrounding states, Jordan, Israel, Lebanon, Turkey.
0851	CLINTON	So getting those chemical weapons out was a big deal, but...
0852	MITCHELL	But should he  should he have stuck to his...
0853	CLINTON	Well  but  but...
0854	MITCHELL	... line?
0855	MITCHELL	Did it hurt U.S. credibility?
0856	CLINTON	I think, as commander in chief, you've got to constantly be evaluating the decisions you have to make.
0857	CLINTON	I know a little bit about this, having spent many hours in the situation room, advising President Obama.
0858	CLINTON	And I want to just add to something that Senator Sanders said, the United States had a very big interest in trying to help stabilize the region.
0859	CLINTON	If there is any blame to be spread around, it starts with the prime minister of Iraq, who sectarianized his military, setting Shia against Sunni.
0860	CLINTON	It is amplified by Assad, who has waged one of the bloodiest, most terrible attacks on his own people 250,000plus dead, millions fleeing.
0861	CLINTON	Causing this vacuum that has been filled unfortunately, by terrorist groups, including ISIS.
0862	CLINTON	So, I think we are in the midst of great turmoil in this region.
0863	CLINTON	We have a proxy conflict going on between Saudi Arabia and Iran.
0864	CLINTON	You know, one of the criticisms I've had of Senator Sanders is his suggestion that, you know, Iranian troops be used to try to end the war in Syria...
0865	MITCHELL	Your time is up.
0866	CLINTON	... and go after ISIS, which I don't think would be a good idea.
0867	SANDERS	Let me just...
0868	MITCHELL	Senator....
0869	CLINTON	But overall, a lot of the forces at work in the region are ones that we cannot directly influence, but we can...
0870	MITCHELL	You're out of time.
0871	SANDERS	OK. Let me suggest...
0872	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
0873	MITCHELL	Senator Sanders.
0874	SANDERS	Where Secretary Clinton and I think, I agree with most of what she said.
0875	SANDERS	But where I think we do have an honest disagreement, is that in the incredible quagmire of Syria, where it's hard to know who's fighting who and if you give arms to this guy, it may end up in ISIS' hand the next day.
0876	SANDERS	We all know that.
0877	SANDERS	And we all know, no argument, the secretary is absolutely right, Assad is a butcher of his own people, man using chemical weapons against his own people.
0878	SANDERS	This is beyond disgusting.
0879	SANDERS	But I think in terms of our priorities in the region, our first priority must be the destruction of ISIS.
0880	SANDERS	Our second priority must be getting rid of Assad, through some political settlement, working with Iran, working with Russia.
0881	SANDERS	But the immediate task is to bring all interests together who want to destroy ISIS, including Russia, including Iran, including our Muslim allies to make that the major priority.
0882	O'MALLEY	But in all of that senator and secretary, I think we're leaving out something very important here.
0883	O'MALLEY	And that is that we still don't have the human intelligence overt, in terms of diplomatic intelligence or covert, to understand even what the heck happens as the secondary and tertiary effects of some of these things.
0884	O'MALLEY	We are walking through this region, Andrea, without the human intelligence that we need.
0885	O'MALLEY	And we need to make a renewed investment as a country in bringing up a new generation of foreign service officers, and bringing up a new generation of business people and actually understanding and having relationships in these places.
0886	O'MALLEY	So we have a better sense of what the heck happens after a dictator topples and can take action to prevent another safe haven and another iteration of terror.
0887	MITCHELL	Your time is us.
0888	MITCHELL	Lester.
0889	HOLT	Senator Sanders mentioned Russia a moment ago.
0890	HOLT	Secretary Clinton, you famously handed Russia's foreign minister a reset button in 2009.
0891	HOLT	Since then, Russia has annexed Crimea, fomented a war in Ukraine, provided weapons that downed an airliner and launched operations, as we just did discuss, to support Assad in Syria.
0892	HOLT	As president, would you hand Vladimir Putin a reset button?
0893	CLINTON	Well, it would depend on what I got for it and I can tell you what we got in the first term, we got a new start treaty to reduce nuclear weapons between the United States and Russia.
0894	CLINTON	We got permission to resupply our troops in Afghanistan by traveling across Russia.
0895	CLINTON	We got Russia to sign on to our sanctions against Iran and other very important commitments.
0896	CLINTON	So look, in diplomacy, you are always trying to see how you can figure out the interest of the other to see if there isn't some way you can advance your security and your values.
0897	CLINTON	When Putin came back in the fall of 2011, it was very clear he came back with a mission.
0898	CLINTON	And I began speaking out as soon as that happened because there were some fraudulent elections held, and Russians poured out into the streets to demand their freedom, and he cracked down.
0899	CLINTON	And in fact, accused me of fomenting it.
0900	CLINTON	So we now know that he has a mixed record to say the least and we have to figure out how to deal with him.
0901	HOLT	What's your relationship with him?
0902	CLINTON	Well, my relationship with him, it's  it's interesting.
0903	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
0904	CLINTON	It's one, I think, of respect.
0905	CLINTON	We've had some very tough dealings with one another.
0906	CLINTON	And I know that he's someone that you have to continuingly stand up to because, like many bullies, he is somebody who will take as much as he possibly can unless you do.
0907	CLINTON	And we need to get the Europeans to be more willing to stand up, I was pleased they put sanctions on after Crimea and eastern Ukraine and the downing of the airliner, but we've got to be more united in preventing Putin from taking a more aggressive stance in Europe and the Middle East.
0908	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0909	HOLT	We to want turn right now to the issue of balancing national security concerns with the privacy rights of Americans.
0910	HOLT	That brings us to YouTube and this question.
0911	SYSTEM	[ begin video clip ]
0912	BROWNLEE	Hi, my name Marques Brownlee, and I've been making YouTube videos about electronics and gadgets for the past seven years.
0913	BROWNLEE	I think America's future success is tied to getting all kinds of tech right.
0914	BROWNLEE	Tech companies are responsible for the encryption technology to protect personal data, but the government wants a back door into that information.
0915	BROWNLEE	So do you think it's possible to find common ground?
0916	BROWNLEE	And where do you stand on privacy versus security?
0917	SYSTEM	[ end video clip ]
0918	HOLT	So, Governor O'Malley.
0919	O'MALLEY	Thank you.
0920	O'MALLEY	I believe whether it's a back door or a front door that the American principle of law should still hold that our federal government should have to get a warrant, whether they want to come through the back door or your front door.
0921	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0922	O'MALLEY	And I also agree, Lester, with Benjamin Franklin, who said, no people should ever give up their privacy or their freedoms in a promise for security.
0923	O'MALLEY	So we're a collaborative people.
0924	O'MALLEY	We need collaborative leadership here with Silicon Valley and other bright people in my own state of Maryland and around the NSA that can actually figure this out.
0925	O'MALLEY	But there are certain immutable principles that will not become antique things in our country so long as we defend our country and its values and its freedoms.
0926	O'MALLEY	And one of those things is our right to be secure in our homes, and our right to expect that our federal government should have to get a warrant.
0927	O'MALLEY	I also want to the say that while we've made some progress on the Patriot Act, I do believe that we need an adversarial court system there.
0928	O'MALLEY	We need a public advocate.
0929	O'MALLEY	We need to develop jurisprudence so that we can develop a body of law that protects the privacy of Americans in the information and digital age.
0930	HOLT	That's time.
0931	HOLT	You have all talked about what you would do fighting ISIS over there, but we've been hit in this country by homegrown terrorists, from Chattanooga to San Bernardino, the recent shooting of a police officer in Philadelphia.
0932	HOLT	How are you going to fight the lone wolves here, Senator Sanders?
0933	O'MALLEY	Yes, Lester, year in and year out I was the leader of the U.S. ...
0934	HOLT	That's a question to Senator Sanders.
0935	HOLT	I wasn't clear, I apologize.
0936	SANDERS	OK.
0937	SANDERS	I just wanted to add, in the previous question, I voted against the USA Patriot Act for many of the reasons that Governor O'Malley mentioned.
0938	SANDERS	But it is not only the government that we have to worry about, it is private corporations.
0939	SANDERS	You would all be amazed, or maybe not, about the amount of information private companies and the government has in terms of the Web sites that you access, the products that you buy, where you are this very moment.
0940	SANDERS	And it is very clear to me that public policy has not caught up with the explosion of technology.
0941	SANDERS	So yes, we have to work with Silicon Valley to make sure that we do not allow ISIS to transmit information...
0942	HOLT	But in terms of lone wolves, the threat, how would you do it?
0943	SANDERS	Right.
0944	SANDERS	What we have got to do there is, among other things, as I was just saying, have Silicon Valley help us to make sure that information being transmitted through the Internet or in other ways by ISIS is, in fact, discovered.
0945	SANDERS	But I do believe we can do that without violating the constitutional and privacy rights of the American people.
0946	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
0947	HOLT	We have to go to a  we have to go to a break, and when we come back, we're going to get to some of the burning questions these candidates have yet to answer and are totally eager to talk about.
0948	CLINTON	Oh, we're breaking?
0949	CLINTON	OK.
0950	SYSTEM	[ commercial break ]
0951	HOLT	And welcome back to Charleston.
0952	HOLT	As we were going to a break, Secretary Clinton, I cut you off.
0953	HOLT	I'll give you 30 seconds to respond on the issue of lone wolves.
0954	O'MALLEY	Can I get 30 seconds, too?
0955	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
0956	SANDERS	Can I get 50 seconds?
0957	HOLT	Secretary Clinton.
0958	CLINTON	Well, I wanted to say, and I'll do it quickly, I was very pleased that leaders of President Obama's administration went out to Silicon Valley last week and began exactly this conversation about what we can do, consistent with privacy and security.
0959	CLINTON	We need better intelligence cooperation, we need to be sure that we are getting the best intelligence that we can from friends and allies around the world.
0960	CLINTON	And then, we've got to recognize our first line of defense against lone wolf attacks is among Muslim Americans.
0961	CLINTON	And it is not only shameful, it is dangerous for the kinds of comments you're hearing from the Republican side.
0962	CLINTON	We need to be reaching out and unifying our country against terrorist attacks and lone wolves, and working with Muslim Americans.
0963	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0964	HOLT	And Andrea has a followup.
0965	O'MALLEY	And Andrea  Andrea  Andrea...
0966	MITCHELL	Just a  just a quick followup, though, Secretary Clinton.
0967	MITCHELL	Just a moment, Governor.
0968	O'MALLEY	Andrea, when can I get my 30 seconds?
0969	MITCHELL	But  but  Secretary Clinton, you said that the leaders from the intelligence community went to Silicon Valley, they were flatly turned down.
0970	MITCHELL	They got nowhere.
0971	CLINTON	That is not what I've heard.
0972	CLINTON	Let me leave it at that.
0973	O'MALLEY	Andrea, I need to talk about homeland security and preparedness.
0974	O'MALLEY	Ever since the attacks of September 11th  30 seconds.
0975	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
0976	O'MALLEY	Ever since the attacks of September 11th, my colleagues, Democratic and Republican mayors, Democratic and Republican governors, made me their leader on homeland security and preparedness.
0977	O'MALLEY	Here in the homeland, unlike combating ISIL abroad, we're almost like it's  your body's immune system.
0978	O'MALLEY	It's able to protect your body against bad bugs, not necessarily because it outnumbers them, but it's better connected  the fusion centers, the biosurveillance systems, better prepared first responders.
0979	O'MALLEY	But there's another front in this battle, and it is this.
0980	O'MALLEY	That's the political front, and if Donald Trump wants to start a registry in our country of people by faith, he can start with me, and I will sign up as one who is totally opposed to his fascist appeals that wants to vilify American Muslims.
0981	O'MALLEY	That can do more damage to our democracy than any...
0982	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
0983	HOLT	All right, that's time, and  and we do...
0984	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0985	HOLT	...we do have to move on.
0986	HOLT	Secretary Clinton, this is the first time...
0987	SANDERS	Can I get a  can I just get a very brief response?
0988	SANDERS	Very brief.
0989	HOLT	Thirty  30  30 seconds, Senator.
0990	SANDERS	OK. One  and I agree with what the secretary said, and what Governor O'Malley said.
0991	SANDERS	But here's an issue that we also should talk about.
0992	SANDERS	We have a $600 billion military budget.
0993	SANDERS	It is a budget larger than the next eight countries'.
0994	SANDERS	Unfortunately, much of that budget continues to fight the old Cold War with the Soviet Union.
0995	SANDERS	Very little of that budget  less than 10 percent  actually goes into fighting ISIS and international terrorism.
0996	SANDERS	We need to be thinking hard about making fundamental changes in the priorities of the Defense Department.
0997	HOLT	All right.
0998	HOLT	Secretary Clinton...
0999	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1000	HOLT	...this is the first time that a spouse of a former president could be elected president.
1001	HOLT	You have said that President Clinton would advise you on economic issues, but be specific, if you can.
1002	HOLT	Are you talking about a kitchentable role on economics, or will he have a real policy role?
1003	CLINTON	Well, it'll start at the kitchen table, we'll see how it goes from there.
1004	CLINTON	And I...
1005	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1006	CLINTON	...I'm going to have the very best advisers that I can possibly have, and when it comes to the economy and what was accomplished under my husband's leadership and the '90s  especially when it came to raising incomes for everybody and lifting more people out of poverty than at any time in recent history  you bet.
1007	CLINTON	I'm going to ask for his ideas, I'm going ask for his advice, and I'm going use him as a goodwill emissary to go around the country to find the best ideas we've got, because I do believe, as he said, everything that's wrong with America has been solved somewhere in America.
1008	CLINTON	We just have to do more of it, and we have to reach out, especially into poor communities and communities of color, to give more people their own chance to get ahead.
1009	HOLT	Senator sanders, a 30 second response, sir.
1010	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1011	SANDERS	Great ideas, Governor O'Malley, Secretary Clinton, but here's the truth.
1012	SANDERS	If you have an administration stacked with Wall Street appointees, it ain't going to accomplish very much.
1013	SANDERS	So here's a promise that I make  and I mentioned a moment ago how corrupt the system is  Goldman Sachs, paying a $5 billion fine, gives this country, in recent history, a Republican secretary of treasury, a Democratic secretary of treasury.
1014	SANDERS	Here's a promise.
1015	SANDERS	If elected president, Goldman Sachs is not going to have  bring forth a secretary of treasury for a Sanders administration.
1016	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1017	MITCHELL	Senator Sanders, let me ask you a question.
1018	MITCHELL	You called Bill Clinton's past transgressions, quote, "totally, totally, totally disgraceful and unacceptable."
1019	MITCHELL	Senator, do you regret saying that?
1020	SANDERS	I was asked a question.
1021	SANDERS	You know, one of the things, Andrea, and I  that question annoys me.
1022	SANDERS	I cannot walk down the street  Secretary Clinton knows this  without being told how much I have to attack secretary Clinton, want to get me on the front pages of the paper, I'd make some vicious attack.
1023	SANDERS	I have avoided doing that.
1024	SANDERS	Trying to run an issueoriented campaign.
1025	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1026	SANDERS	I was asked a question.
1027	MITCHELL	You didn't have to answer it that way, though.
1028	MITCHELL	Why did you?
1029	SANDERS	Well  then if I don't answer it, then there's another front page, so it's yes.
1030	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
1031	SANDERS	And I mean this seriously.
1032	SANDERS	You know that.
1033	SANDERS	We've been through this.
1034	SANDERS	Yes, his behavior was deplorable.
1035	SANDERS	Have I ever once said a word about that issue?
1036	SANDERS	No, I have not.
1037	SANDERS	I'm going to debate Secretary Clinton, Governor O'Malley, on the issues facing the American people, not Bill Clinton's personal behavior.
1038	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1039	HOLT	We will take a break.
1040	HOLT	We'll continue from Charleston right after this.
1041	SYSTEM	[ commercial break ]
1042	HOLT	Welcome back everybody.
1043	HOLT	Finally, before we go tonight, we set out here to understand points of differences between you.
1044	HOLT	We believe we've learned a lot here, but before we leave, is there anything that you really wanted to say tonight that you haven't gotten a chance to say.
1045	HOLT	And, we'll start with Governor O'Malley.
1046	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
1047	HOLT	Didn't see that coming, did you?
1048	O'MALLEY	Yes, but we're going to have to get 20 minutes to do it, so.
1049	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
1050	MITCHELL	...too long.
1051	O'MALLEY	I believe there are many issues.
1052	O'MALLEY	I have 60 seconds for this?
1053	HOLT	Sixty seconds, we'd appreciate it.
1054	O'MALLEY	There are so many issues that we haven't been able to discuss here.
1055	O'MALLEY	We have not fully discussed immigration reform, and the deplorable number of immigrant detention camps that our nation's now maintaining.
1056	O'MALLEY	We haven't discussed the shameful treatment that the people of Puerto Rico, our fellow Americans, are getting treated with by these hedge funds that are working them over.
1057	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1058	O'MALLEY	We haven't discussed the fact that in our hemisphere we have the danger of nationstate failures because of drug traffickers and Honduras, and Guatemala and El Salvador.
1059	O'MALLEY	I guess the bottom line is this, look we are a great people the way we act at home and abroad based on the beliefs that unite us.
1060	O'MALLEY	Our belief in the dignity of every person, our belief in our own common good.
1061	O'MALLEY	There is now challenge that is too great for us to overcome provided we bring forward in these divided times, new leadership that can heal our divides here at home and bring our principles into alignment abroad.
1062	O'MALLEY	We're on the threshold of a new era of American progress and I believe we have only need to join forces together and cross that threshold into a new era of American prosperity.
1063	HOLT	And that's time.
1064	O'MALLEY	Thanks a lot.
1065	HOLT	Secretary Clinton?
1066	CLINTON	Well Lester, I spent a lot of time last week being outraged by what's happening in Flint, Michigan and I think every single American should be outraged.
1067	CLINTON	We've had a city in the United States of America where the population which is poor in many ways and majority African American has been drinking and bathing in lead contaminated water.
1068	CLINTON	And the governor of that state acted as though he didn't really care.
1069	CLINTON	He had request for help and he had basically stone walled.
1070	CLINTON	I'll tell you what, if the kids in a rich suburb of Detroit had been drinking contaminated water and being bathed in it, there would've been action.
1071	CLINTON	So I sent my top campaign aide down there to talk to the mayor of Flint to see what I could to help.
1072	CLINTON	I issued a statement about what we needed to do and then I went on a T.V.
1073	CLINTON	show and I said, "it was outrageous that the governor hadn't acted and within two hours he had."
1074	HOLT	And that's time.
1075	CLINTON	I want to be a president who takes care of the big problems and the problems that are affecting the people of our country everyday.
1076	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1077	HOLT	Thank you.
1078	HOLT	Senator Sanders?
1079	SANDERS	Well, Secretary Clinton was right and what I did which I think is also right, is demanded the resignation of governor.
1080	SANDERS	A man who acts that irresponsibly should not stay in power.
1081	SANDERS	Now, we are a great nation  and we've heard a lot of great ideas here tonight.
1082	SANDERS	Let's be honest and let's be truthful.
1083	SANDERS	Very little is going to be done to transform our economy and to create the kind of middle class we need unless we end a corrupt campaign finance system which is undermining American democracy.
1084	SANDERS	We've got to get rid of Super PACs, we've got to get rid of Citizens' United and what we've got to do is create a political revolution which revitalizes American democracy which brings millions of young people and working people into the political process.
1085	SANDERS	To say loudly and clearly," that the government of the United States of America belongs to all of us and not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors."
1086	HOLT	All right.
1087	HOLT	Well thank you and thanks to all of you for being here tonight shedding light on some of the differences as Americans get ready to vote.
1088	HOLT	I also want to thank the Congressional Black Caucus Institute and certainly my friend and colleague, Andrea Mitchell.
1089	HOLT	This has been great.
1090	HOLT	It's been a great spirited conversation and American people appreciate it.
