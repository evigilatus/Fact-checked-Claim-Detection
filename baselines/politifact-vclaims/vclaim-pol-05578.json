Those efforts have all fallen short \u2014 either in the General Assembly, at the governor\u2019s desk or in the courts. In the upcoming legislative session, lawmakers will try again.\n\n\nTheir 2016 plan is a referendum on amending the Missouri Constitution to give the Secretary of State, whose office oversees elections, the power to require that would-be voters present government-issued photo identification. Along with the amendment, lawmakers are pushing a bill that would write photo ID requirements into law.\n\n\nBoth measures were pre-filed Dec. 1 by Sen. Will Kraus, R-Lee\u2019s Summit. Kraus has pushed similar measures in past legislative sessions, and next year he will be on the ballot for Secretary of State.\n\n\nHe says there are lots of things that already require a photo I.D., like driving a car or opening a bank account, and that voting should be among them. He\u2019s also presented it as a solution to voter fraud.\n\n\nSpeaking on the Aug. 30 episode of This Week in Missouri Politics, Kraus said: \"There\u2019s over 16 people in the state of Missouri who have been convicted of some type of voter fraud. That shows people in the state of Missouri are trying to cheat elections.\"\n\n\nThat combination of specificity and vagueness piqued our interest.\n\n\nCourt cases\n\n\nKraus didn\u2019t give a timeframe for his statement. When reached for comment, his campaign emailed a report from the Heritage Foundation that pointed to 17 convictions since 2005.\n\n\nBut none of the cases involved voter impersonation, which is what voter I.D. laws are designed to combat. Instead, all 17 were convicted on false voter registrations.\n\n\nRegistering to vote doesn\u2019t require a photo I.D.; it can be done by mail. And Kraus\u2019 proposed amendment only applies to \"a voter seeking to vote in person,\" according to the bill summary. So none of those 17 cases would\u2019ve been averted by his proposals.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoreover, not every person in the Heritage report was convicted of an election offense, per se. For instance, the document highlights the case of Nonaresa Montgomery, who was accused in 2001 of registering fake voters in St. Louis before the mayoral election. Election workers realized that among the names Montgomery submitted was an alderman who had been dead for about a decade, and the fake registrations never made it onto city rolls.\n\n\nSix volunteer activists pleaded guilty to election violations, but Montgomery wasn\u2019t among them. Instead, she was found guilty of perjury for lying to a grand jury about being able to track the registration cards the volunteers had given her.\n\n\nVoter Impersonation\n\n\nThe Secretary of State\u2019s office runs an elections integrity unit whose job is to monitor irregularities. Laura Swinford, who was the Secretary of State\u2019s spokeswoman\u00a0until November, said that unit hasn\u2019t handled any cases of voter impersonation fraud.\n\n\n\"We don\u2019t have reported cases of voter fraud. We just don\u2019t,\" she said in October.\n\n\n\"The reality is there hasn\u2019t been a documented case\" of voter impersonation, said Stephanie Fleming, who replaced Swinford as the Secretary of State\u2019s spokeswoman.\n\n\nSwinford, who now is executive director of Progress Missouri, said the Secretary of State\u2019s office recently encountered fraudulent signatures on petitions, but \"the reason we know that is the system is working.\"\n\n\nCounties aren\u2019t required to report cases of election irregularities to the Secretary of State\u2019s office, although they typically do, so it\u2019s difficult to definitively say zero cases of voter impersonation have occurred, she said. But it\u2019s rare enough to conclude voter impersonation isn\u2019t a problem in Missouri, she said.\n\n\n\"I can\u2019t prove there\u2019s no bigfoot. There\u2019s just no bigfoot,\" she said.\n\n\nOur ruling\n\n\nKraus said Missouri needs a voter I.D. law because there have been more than 16 cases of \"some type of voter fraud\" in Missouri. That number isn\u2019t wrong, but it doesn\u2019t support Kraus\u2019 assertion that photo identification would solve the problem \u2014 or that there is a problem of people impersonating voters.\n\n\nKraus\u2019 statement is partially accurate but takes things out of context.
