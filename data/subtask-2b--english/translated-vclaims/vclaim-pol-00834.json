In defending this measure, Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin indicated that legal protection for these individuals is low in most parts of the country. Baldwin was the first gay senator in the Senate. In 2018, Mr. Kirsten Cinema of Arizona became the first dual-sex member. The two are the only lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, gay, bisexual and transgender members of the body. \"The Equality Act recognizes the fact that more than half of the states in the United States do not have legal protection for people who prevent or give them tools to combat discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity,\" said Baldwin Jonathan Van Ness on March 12, 2019 in his \"Get curious\" episode of Podcast. Specifically, Baldwin claimed that 29 states lacked \"comprehensive protection\" for members of the LGBT community. In 2015, the United States Supreme Court ruled that the ban on same-sex marriage was unconstitutional. Wisconsin has included protection against discrimination against sex and sexual orientation since 1982, and has become the first state to enact such laws. (Wisconsin did not go so far as to fully protect transgender persons, as Polyte Fact and Wisconsin found in 2015.) Is Baldwin right about the other states? The Equality Act was introduced for the first time in the Chamber of Deputies in 2015, an updated version of an Act introduced in 1974, aimed at extending the scope of the Civil Rights Act 1964 to prohibit discrimination on the basis of \"sex, marital status or sexual orientation in public places of residence.\" The new version of the 1974 Act extends to the addition of gender identity, defining it as \"gender-related identity, appearance, behaviour or characteristics, irrespective of the gender of the individual at birth,\" which would include transgender individuals. There are also many places where discrimination is specifically prohibited and added in gymnasiums, shops, banks, travel agencies, etc. On January 26, 2021, Jim Steinke stated on Republican Twitter that they \"come to the table\" and were part of a compromise \"Give and Take\" on the Corona virus bill. \u2022 On 27 January 2021, supporters of this measure say that it is a step towards the full equality of the LGBT community, while conservative opponents say that the bill is a threat to religious freedom and freedom of expression - especially for those who choose to run business according to their religious beliefs. To date, 21 states and Washington, D.C. have laws prohibiting discrimination against sexual orientation and gender identity, in accordance with the Movement Promotion Project, a non-profit group to advocate for equal rights. The Panel collected its data from existing state statutes. Wisconsin prohibits discrimination against sexual orientation but does not go so far as to address gender identity. Therefore, it does not count between 21. Of course, if 21 States have such protection, 29 will not. Adam Romero, a professor at the University of California at the Law School in Los Angeles, said, \"At present, federal anti-discrimination laws, such as Title VII (Civil Rights Act 1964), do not prohibit discrimination in the apparent context of employment, sexual orientation or discrimination in gender identity.\" \"The law does not say the word sexual orientation or sexual identity.\" Thus, LGBT individuals living in states with anti-discrimination laws enjoy stronger protection of civil rights than they do not. Some of these laws may also be covered by decrees issued by cities or provinces prohibiting discrimination. In fact, those living in States where there are no such provisions face less protection. \"If you live in California, you have protection against discrimination at work or Nevada or New Mexico and these other states,\" said Romero. \"But if you live in Texas, Oklahoma, Florida, or many other states without these state laws, you are not protected under state law from discrimination (on the basis of) sexual orientation or gender identity under these state laws. \"The Equality Act will benefit all lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) persons throughout the country but will be particularly useful for those living in states without state protection.\" Our assessment in Baldwin claimed that 29 states do not have comprehensive protection for LGBT persons. The number on the money, based on our conversation with Romero and other research data on state laws. We're evaluating Baldwin's claim right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00834"}
