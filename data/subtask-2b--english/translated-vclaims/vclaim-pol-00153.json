Hugo filed the claim in at least four letters for the election campaign in Beit 40 District, which covers parts of Fairfax County and Prince William County. Here's a sample: \"while my opponent believes that the health care system will be completely abolished and replaced by a plan that will cost taxpayers trillions of dollars, I think we can make improvements to our current system while protecting private insurance,\" Hugo wrote on 10 September. \"Dan Helmer wants to end his private health insurance,\" says Hugo in the letters of a big brown on a shiny courier. \"Dan Helmer supports the cancellation of our private health-care insurance and the establishment of a huge government-run system,\" says another postman with a caricature from Helmer, shining behind a platform. \"Now, Helmer wants to completely abolish our health-care system and replace it with a large and costly government-controlled system that taxpayers like us have to pay,\" says Hugo in another postman called Helmer, an \"extremist.\" A website run by friends of fund-raising for Tim Hugo says, \"Dan supports a plan (medical insurance) that would cost taxpayers trillions of dollars. If not bad enough, Dan's plan will also deprive people of private insurance.\" We have verified Hugo &apos; s repeated allegation. In one of his reporters, Hugo says that his source is the May 2018 announcement by Helmer when he ran for the Democratic running for Congressional 10th seat. Helmer finished the fourth in six people who won the Jennifer Wixton Prize, which won the general election. \"I'm for the medical care option for all,\" says Helmer in the ad. Under the screen it says, \"Dan Helmer Medicare for all.\" Unlike the sound, the word \"option\" is missing. The GOP Garin Shipley strategy sent us an e-mail for the Hugo campaign, saying that \"the medical care option for all\" is equivalent to the cancellation of private insurance. Let us know the terms: medical care is a national health insurance programme covering Americans 65 or more and some other groups with disabilities or specific illnesses. In 2018, health coverage was provided to 59.9 million people, some 52 million of whom were elderly. Medical care for all will replace the current health insurance system with a single government programme covering all Americans. Employers are prohibited from offering competitive insurance. Medical care for all is an issue of signing in the C. Bernie Sanders presidential race, I-Vt. He proposed a generous plan covering visits to hospitals, primary care, medical equipment, laboratory services, maternity care, prescriptions, as well as vision and dental care. Consumers will not be subject to any costs from their own funds, except for their participation in the payment of prescriptions. The non-partisan budget of Congress did not estimate the cost of the Sanders proposal or plans with lower individual pay. The Mercatus Centre, a free research organization affiliated with George Mason University, estimates that the cost of the Sanders Plan will be $32.6 trillion over 10 years and will not be paid even if income and corporate taxes double. Check the facts (Kirk Cox) was mentioned on January 13, 2021 in a speech. Virginia ranked lowest third of the states in the management of the COVID-19 vaccine. On January 20, 2021, the Urban Institute, a more liberal academic centre in Washington, looked at the Sanders Plan in 2016 and expected to add $32 trillion over the decade. The Institute estimated that state and local governments would save $4.1 trillion over 10 years, and that households and businesses would save $21.9 trillion. Public choice plans would give working adults with middle and higher incomes a choice: they may remain secure from the private sector, or buy a new government-run program using the network of medical care providers and their costs. There are still at least four draft public options bills in Congress, including a bill entitled \"Medical Care X,\" co-sponsored by Sen. Tim Kane, D-Va. The cost of the invoices was not analysed by the local community office. Proponents say that the medical care system will be broken at least because the bill requires the premiums to cover \"the full actuarial cost of presenting such a plan, including administrative costs.\" A study conducted by the Community Organization in 2013 concluded that a similar programme would reduce the federal deficit by $158 billion over 10 years. We found Helmer's record in the search for Helmer in eight cases either that Helmer said, or that he reportedly supported the option of providing medical care for all. On the contrary, there was only one case where medical care for all was more widely mentioned (without option). That was on the print in Hugo's TV commercial. And remember, at the same time that those words appeared, Helmer said in the Declaration that he supported a general option. In addition to the words of Helmer in the ad, we found three articles in the Washington Post, one in ABC News, and one in McLean Connect that Helmer supported the medical care option for all. Helmer wrote a newspaper article in the Winchester Star Declaration: \"I will fight to ensure that every American has access to health care by supporting the universal medical care option that allows any American who does not have insurance or does not like to choose it for medical care.\" Almost a similar statement was made in a candidates &apos; forum. The ballot in 2018 wrote: \"On the website of his campaign, Helmer included weapons safety, expanded the Law on Affordable Care to include the option of medical care for all, and created jobs as some of his policy priorities.\" How does Hugo turn Hillmer's repeated calls for health insurance options into an invitation to terminate private medical insurance? By making a very literal argument. * Chibli said that there is no such thing as the medical care option for all - it is a contradiction in terminology. Medical care for all meant in itself the existence of a single insurance company - the Government - and there could be no choice. Chibli observed that the \"general option\" was the correct term for offering a choice between private or government health insurance, and Helmer never used those words. \"If Helmer supports the general option plan, he supports a general option, or \"Medicare X,\" as proposed by Tim Kane,\" said Shepley. \"But he didn't. He said: \"Medical care for all.\" Our referee Hugo says that Helmer wants to cancel private health insurance. In the 2018 campaign, Helmer repeatedly said that he supported \"the medical care option for all,\" which \"may allow Americans who do not have insurance or do not like it to choose medical care.\" In other words, private insurance will remain in place. But Helmer used an inaccurate language that Hugo used as a probative argument. Since medical care for all means that the Government will be the only provider of health insurance, Hugo says that it cannot have a private insurance option. \u25cf Does it want to end the special insurance, with Hugo's integrity? If Helmer had used the correct term - the general choice - Hugo's logic would have evaporated. But his bad language left him open for interpretation, and Hugo took the liberty of creating a misleading position for Helmer. We appreciate Hugo's often false statement.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00153"}
