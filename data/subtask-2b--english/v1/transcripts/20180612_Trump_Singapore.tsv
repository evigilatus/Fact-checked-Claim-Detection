0001	Donald Trump	Well, thank you very much, everybody.
0002	Donald Trump	We appreciate it.
0003	Donald Trump	We're getting ready to go back.
0004	Donald Trump	We had a tremendous 24 hours.
0005	Donald Trump	We've had a tremendous three months, actually, because this has been going on for quite a while.
0006	Donald Trump	That was a tape that we gave to Chairman Kim and his people, his representatives.
0007	Donald Trump	And it captures a lot.
0008	Donald Trump	It captures what could be done.
0009	Donald Trump	And that's a great  a great place.
0010	Donald Trump	It has the potential to be an incredible place.
0011	Donald Trump	Between South Korea  if you think about it  and China, it's got tremendous potential.
0012	Donald Trump	And I think he understands that and he wants to do what's right.
0013	Donald Trump	It's my honor today to address the people of the world, following this very historic summit with Chairman Kim Jong Un of North Korea.
0014	Donald Trump	We spent very intensive hours together, and I think most of you have gotten the signed document, or you will very shortly.
0015	Donald Trump	It's very comprehensive.
0016	Donald Trump	It's going to happen.
0017	Donald Trump	I stand before you as an emissary of the American people to deliver a message of hope and vision, and a message of peace.
0018	Donald Trump	Let me begin by thanking our incredible hosts in Singapore, especially Prime Minister Lee, a friend of mine.
0019	Donald Trump	This is a country of profound grace and beauty, and we send our warmest wishes to every citizen of Singapore, who really made this visit so important and so pleasant, despite all of the work and all of the long hours.
0020	Donald Trump	I also want to thank President Moon of South Korea.
0021	Donald Trump	He's working hard.
0022	Donald Trump	In fact, I'll be speaking to him right after we're finished.
0023	Donald Trump	Prime Minister Abe of Japan  a friend of mine  just left our country, and he wants what's right for Japan and for the world.
0024	Donald Trump	He's a good man.
0025	Donald Trump	And a very special person, President Xi of China, who has really closed up that border  maybe a little bit less so over the last couple of months, but that's okay.
0026	Donald Trump	But he really has.
0027	Donald Trump	And he's a terrific person and a friend of mine, and really a great leader of his people.
0028	Donald Trump	I want to thank them for their efforts to help us get to this very historic day.
0029	Donald Trump	Most importantly, I want to thank Chairman Kim for taking the first bold step toward a bright new future for his people.
0030	Donald Trump	Our unprecedented meeting  the first between an American President and a leader of North Korea  proves that real change is indeed possible.
0031	Donald Trump	My meeting with Chairman Kim was honest, direct, and productive.
0032	Donald Trump	We got to know each other well in a very confined period of time, under very strong, strong circumstance.
0033	Donald Trump	We're prepared to start a new history and we're ready to write a new chapter between our nations.
0034	Donald Trump	Nearly 70 years ago  think of that 70 years ago  an extremely bloody conflict ravaged the Korean Peninsula.
0035	Donald Trump	Countless people died in the conflict, including tens of thousands of brave Americans.
0036	Donald Trump	Yet, while the armistice was agreed to, the war never ended.
0037	Donald Trump	To this day, never ended.
0038	Donald Trump	But now we can all have hope that it will soon end.
0039	Donald Trump	And it will.
0040	Donald Trump	It will soon end.
0041	Donald Trump	The past does not have to define the future.
0042	Donald Trump	Yesterday's conflict does not have to be tomorrow's war.
0043	Donald Trump	And as history has proven over and over again, adversaries can indeed become friends.
0044	Donald Trump	We can honor the sacrifice of our forefathers by replacing the horrors of battle with the blessings of peace.
0045	Donald Trump	And that's what we're doing and that's what we have done.
0046	Donald Trump	There is no limit to what North Korea can achieve when it gives up its nuclear weapons and embraces commerce and engagement with the rest of the world  that really wants to engage.
0047	Donald Trump	Chairman Kim has before him an opportunity like no other to be remembered as the leader who ushered in a glorious new era of security and prosperity for his people.
0048	Donald Trump	Chairman Kim and I just signed a joint statement in which he reaffirmed his "unwavering commitment to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula."
0049	Donald Trump	We also agreed to vigorous negotiations to implement the agreement as soon as possible.
0050	Donald Trump	And he wants to do that.
0051	Donald Trump	This isn't the past.
0052	Donald Trump	This isn't another administration that never got it started and therefore never got it done.
0053	Donald Trump	Chairman Kim has told me that North Korea is already destroying a major missile engine testing site.
0054	Donald Trump	That's not in your signed document we agreed to that after the agreement was signed.
0055	Donald Trump	That's a big thing  for the missiles that they were testing, the site is going to be destroyed very soon.
0056	Donald Trump	Today is the beginning of an arduous process.
0057	Donald Trump	Our eyes are wide open, but peace is always worth the effort, especially in this case.
0058	Donald Trump	This should have been done years ago.
0059	Donald Trump	This should have been resolved a long time ago, but we're resolving it now.
0060	Donald Trump	Chairman Kim has the chance to seize an incredible future for his people.
0061	Donald Trump	Anyone can make war, but only the most courageous can make peace.
0062	Donald Trump	The current state of affairs cannot endure forever.
0063	Donald Trump	The people of Korea  North and South  are profoundly talented, industrious, and gifted.
0064	Donald Trump	These are truly gifted people.
0065	Donald Trump	They share the same heritage, language, customs, culture, and destiny.
0066	Donald Trump	But to realize their amazing destiny, to reunite their national family, the menace of nuclear weapons will now be removed.
0067	Donald Trump	In the meantime, the sanctions will remain in effect.
0068	Donald Trump	We dream of a future where all Koreans can live together in harmony, where families are reunited and hopes are reborn, and where the light of peace chases away the darkness of war.
0069	Donald Trump	This bright future is within  and this is what's happening.
0070	Donald Trump	It is right there.
0071	Donald Trump	It's within our reach.
0072	Donald Trump	It's going to be there.
0073	Donald Trump	It's going to happen.
0074	Donald Trump	People thought this could never take place.
0075	Donald Trump	It is now taking place.
0076	Donald Trump	It's a very great day.
0077	Donald Trump	It's a very great moment in the history of the world.
0078	Donald Trump	And Chairman Kim is on his way back to North Korea.
0079	Donald Trump	And I know for a fact, as soon as he arrives, he's going to start a process that's going to make a lot of people very happy and very safe.
0080	Donald Trump	So it's an honor to be with everybody today.
0081	Donald Trump	The media  this is a big gathering of media, I will say.
0082	Donald Trump	It makes me feel very uncomfortable.
0083	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
0084	Donald Trump	But it is what it is.
0085	Donald Trump	People understand that this is something very important to all of us, including yourselves and your families.
0086	Donald Trump	So thank you very much for being here.
0087	Donald Trump	We'll take some questions.
0088	Donald Trump	Wow.
0089	Donald Trump	That's a lot of questions.
0090	Donald Trump	Go ahead.
0091	Donald Trump	Sure, go ahead.
0092	Donald Trump	NBC.
0093	Question	Thank you, Mr. President.
0094	Question	Two questions for you, if you don't mind.
0095	Question	First, the man you met today, Kim Jong Un, as you know, has killed family members, has starved his own people, is responsible for the death of Otto Warmbier.
0096	Question	Why are you so comfortable calling him "very talented"?
0097	Donald Trump	Well, he is very talented.
0098	Donald Trump	Anybody that takes over a situation like he did, at 26 years of age, and is able to run it, and run it tough  I don't say he was nice or I don't say anything about it  he ran it.
0099	Donald Trump	Very few people, at that age  you can take one out of ten thousand, probably, couldn't do it.
0100	Donald Trump	Otto Warmbier is a very special person, and he will be for a long time, in my life.
0101	Donald Trump	His parents are good friends of mine.
0102	Donald Trump	I think, without Otto, this would not have happened.
0103	Donald Trump	Something happened, from that day.
0104	Donald Trump	It was a terrible thing.
0105	Donald Trump	It was brutal.
0106	Donald Trump	But a lot of people started to focus on what was going on, including North Korea.
0107	Donald Trump	I really think that Otto is someone who did not die in vain.
0108	Donald Trump	I told this to his parents.
0109	Donald Trump	Special young man.
0110	Donald Trump	And I have to say, special parents, special people.
0111	Donald Trump	Otto did not die in vain.
0112	Donald Trump	He had a lot to do with us being here today.
0113	Donald Trump	Okay?
0114	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.
0115	Question	Mr. President, that second question for you, sir, was on the security  the second question, sir 
0116	Donald Trump	Go ahead.
0117	Question	 on the security assurances you talked about in your statement.
0118	Question	Can you be specific about what assurances you are willing to give to Kim Jong Un?
0119	Question	Does that include reducing military capabilities?
0120	Donald Trump	No.
0121	Question	And just to follow up on your answer 
0122	Donald Trump	No, we're not reducing anything.
0123	Donald Trump	We're not reducing.
0124	Donald Trump	At some point, I have to be honest  and I used to say this during my campaign, as you know, probably, better than most  I want to get our soldiers out.
0125	Donald Trump	I want to bring our soldiers back home.
0126	Donald Trump	We have, right now, 32,000 soldiers in South Korea, and I'd like to be able to bring them back home.
0127	Donald Trump	But that's not part of the equation right now.
0128	Donald Trump	At some point, I hope it will be, but not right now.
0129	Donald Trump	We will be stopping the war games, which will save us a tremendous amount of money, unless and until we see the future negotiation is not going along like it should.
0130	Donald Trump	But we'll be saving a tremendous amount of money.
0131	Donald Trump	Plus, I think it's very provocative.
0132	Donald Trump	Yes, John.
0133	Donald Trump	Yes, John, go ahead.
0134	Donald Trump	Oh, go ahead.
0135	Donald Trump	I'm sorry, I thought you were John Roberts.
0136	Donald Trump	I looked at you, you just like 
0137	Question	It's all right.
0138	Donald Trump	Much better, right?
0139	Question	Frequently  we're frequently confused, Mr. President.
0140	Donald Trump	Yes.
0141	Question	Mr. President, this joint statement does not talk about verifiable or irreversible denuclearization.
0142	Donald Trump	Yeah.
0143	Question	Was that a concession on the part of the United States?
0144	Donald Trump	No, not at all.
0145	Donald Trump	Because if you look at it, I mean, it said we are going to  let's see here  it will be gone.
0146	Donald Trump	I don't think you can be anymore plain than what we're asking  "issues related to the establishment of the new U.S. DPRK relations"  the building.
0147	Donald Trump	We talk about the guarantees, and we talk about "unwavering commitment to the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula."
0148	Donald Trump	This is the document that we just signed.
0149	Question	Did you discuss with Chairman Kim methods to verify, either with the United States or international organizations, that very process?
0150	Question	And do you have a timetable 
0151	Donald Trump	Yes, we did.
0152	Donald Trump	Yes, we did.
0153	Donald Trump	And we'll be verifying.
0154	Question	Can you give that to us?
0155	Donald Trump	Yeah, we'll be verifying.
0156	Donald Trump	It will be verified.
0157	Question	How is that going to be achieved, Mr. President?
0158	Donald Trump	Well, it's going to be achieved by having a lot of people there, and as we develop a certain trust.
0159	Donald Trump	And we think we have done that.
0160	Donald Trump	Secretary Pompeo has been really doing a fantastic job  his staff, everybody.
0161	Donald Trump	As we do that, we're going to have a lot of people there, and we're going to be working with them on a lot of other things.
0162	Donald Trump	But this is complete denuclearization of North Korea, and it will be verified.
0163	Question	Will those people be Americans or international 
0164	Donald Trump	Uh, combinations of both.
0165	Donald Trump	Combinations of both.
0166	Donald Trump	And we have talked about it, yes.
0167	Donald Trump	Yeah, go ahead.
0168	Donald Trump	Be nice.
0169	Donald Trump	Be respectful.
0170	Question	I'll be very respectful, sir.
0171	Question	What did Kim Jong Un say to you to give you the confidence that, for once in the history of North Korea, they are not cheating the system, and gaming the world, and gaming the people who will have to go in and make sure that they're actually giving up their nuclear arsenal?
0172	Question	What did he say to you?
0173	Donald Trump	Yeah, I mean, very fair question.
0174	Donald Trump	He actually mentioned the fact that they proceeded down a path in the past, and, ultimately, as you know, nothing got done.
0175	Donald Trump	In one case, they took billions of dollars  during the Clinton regime  took billions of dollars and nothing happened.
0176	Donald Trump	That was a terrible thing, and he actually brought it up to me.
0177	Donald Trump	And he said we have never gone this far.
0178	Donald Trump	I don't think they've ever had the confidence, frankly, in a President that they have right now for getting things done and having the ability to get things done.
0179	Donald Trump	And he was very firm in the fact that he wants to do this.
0180	Donald Trump	I think he might want to do this as much or even more than me because they see a very bright future for North Korea.
0181	Donald Trump	So you never know.
0182	Donald Trump	Right?
0183	Donald Trump	We never know.
0184	Donald Trump	But I'll tell you what, we signed a very comprehensive document today, and I think most of you have been given that document.
0185	Donald Trump	But we signed a very, very comprehensive document, and I believe he's going to live up to that document.
0186	Donald Trump	In fact, when he lands  which is going to be shortly  I think that he will start that process right away.
0187	Question	Do you trust him, Mr. President?
0188	Donald Trump	I do.
0189	Donald Trump	I do.
0190	Donald Trump	I can only say that I know him for  really well, it's been very rhetorical, as you know.
0191	Donald Trump	I think, without the rhetoric, it wouldn't have happened.
0192	Donald Trump	I think without other things going along  I think the establishment of a new team was very important.
0193	Donald Trump	We have a great team.
0194	Donald Trump	But I do, I think he wants to get it done.
0195	Donald Trump	I really feel that very strongly.
0196	Donald Trump	Oh, there's John.
0197	Donald Trump	I think  you know, you two guys look alike when the light is right on the  the hair is very similar.
0198	Donald Trump	Let me see, who has better hair?
0199	Donald Trump	He's got pretty good hair, John, I hate to 
0200	Question	It's the angelic glow of the backlighting, Mr. President, that makes us look so similar.
0201	Question	Of course, the denuclearization  nuclear weapons and biological weapons and whatnot  is one problem in North Korea.
0202	Question	Another huge problem is the horrible record that they have on human rights.
0203	Question	Was that discussed at all?
0204	Donald Trump	Yes.
0205	Question	Is that something that you will tackle in the future?
0206	Donald Trump	Yes, it was discussed.
0207	Donald Trump	It will be discussed more in the future  human rights.
0208	Donald Trump	What was also discussed in great detail, John, was that fact that, you know, we have  and I must have had just countless calls and letters and tweets, anything you can do  they want the remains of their sons back.
0209	Donald Trump	They want the remains of their fathers, and mothers, and all of the people that got caught into that really brutal war, which took place, to a large extent, in North Korea.
0210	Donald Trump	And I asked for it today, and we got it.
0211	Donald Trump	That was a very last minute.
0212	Donald Trump	The remains will be coming back.
0213	Donald Trump	They're going to start that process immediately.
0214	Donald Trump	But so many people, even during the campaign, they'd say, "Is there any way you can work with North Korea to get the remains of my son back or my father back?"
0215	Donald Trump	So many people asked me this question.
0216	Donald Trump	And, you know, I said, "Look, we don't get along too well with that particular group of people."
0217	Donald Trump	But now we do.
0218	Donald Trump	And he agreed to that so quickly and so nice  it was really a very nice thing, and he understands it.
0219	Donald Trump	He understands it.
0220	Donald Trump	So for the thousands and thousands  I guess way over 6,000 that we know of, in terms of the remains, they'll be brought back.
0221	Question	The POWMIA issue clearly is a very important one for thousands of Americans.
0222	Donald Trump	Especially to a lot of people that are 
0223	Question	But what do you, President Trump, expect Kim Jong Un to do about the human rights record regarding the North Korean people?
0224	Donald Trump	Right.
0225	Donald Trump	It was discussed.
0226	Donald Trump	It was discussed relatively briefly compared to denuclearization.
0227	Donald Trump	Well, obviously, that's where we started and where we ended.
0228	Donald Trump	But they will be doing things, and I think he wants to do things.
0229	Donald Trump	I think he wants to  you'd be very surprised.
0230	Donald Trump	Very smart.
0231	Donald Trump	Very good negotiator.
0232	Donald Trump	Wants to do the right thing.
0233	Donald Trump	You know, he brought up the fact that, in the past, they took dialogue far  they never went  they never were like we are.
0234	Donald Trump	There's never been anything like what's taken place now.
0235	Donald Trump	But they went down the line.
0236	Donald Trump	Billions of dollars were given, and you know, the following day the nuclear program continued.
0237	Donald Trump	But this is a much different time, and this is a much different President, in all fairness.
0238	Donald Trump	This is very important to me.
0239	Donald Trump	This is one of the  perhaps, one of the reasons that I  one, I campaigned on this issue, as you know very well, John.
0240	Donald Trump	Okay.
0241	Donald Trump	Whoever those people are.
0242	Donald Trump	I cannot see you with all the lights, but you don't look like either of the two.
0243	Donald Trump	Yeah, go ahead.
0244	Donald Trump	Sure.
0245	Donald Trump	Go ahead.
0246	Question	Thank you, Mr. President.
0247	Question	And first of all, congratulations.
0248	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.
0249	Donald Trump	Appreciate it.
0250	Question	Can you touch on the issue of a peace treaty?
0251	Question	And also, will you travel to Pyongyang anytime soon?
0252	Donald Trump	Well, at a certain time, I will.
0253	Donald Trump	I said that will be a day that I look very much forward to, at the appropriate time.
0254	Donald Trump	And I also will be inviting Chairman Kim, at the appropriate time, to the White House.
0255	Donald Trump	I think it's really going to be something that will be very important.
0256	Donald Trump	And he has accepted.
0257	Donald Trump	I said, at the appropriate time.
0258	Donald Trump	We want to go a little bit further down the road.
0259	Donald Trump	But what we signed today was a lot of things included.
0260	Donald Trump	And then you have things that weren't included that we got after the deal was signed.
0261	Donald Trump	I've done that before in my life.
0262	Donald Trump	We didn't put it in the agreement because we didn't have time.
0263	Donald Trump	And I think most of you have been handed out the agreement or soon will.
0264	Donald Trump	But I 
0265	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]
0266	Donald Trump	Oh, you have not?
0267	Donald Trump	Okay.
0268	Donald Trump	Well, if you could have those agreements passed out.
0269	Donald Trump	We just finished them, just a little while ago.
0270	Donald Trump	But if you could have the agreements passed out, we'll  you'll see what we're talking about.
0271	Donald Trump	Yes, sir.
0272	Donald Trump	Go ahead.
0273	Question	I will second the congratulations, President.
0274	Donald Trump	Thank you.
0275	Question	What part did Japan play?
0276	Question	And did the abduction issue come up?
0277	Donald Trump	Yes.
0278	Question	And also, the fate of the Christians?
0279	Donald Trump	Yes.
0280	Question	And the followup question is when will you be doing an interview with Japanese TV?
0281	Question	Fiftythousand American troops are in Japan.
0282	Question	Congratulations, again.
0283	Donald Trump	That's true.
0284	Donald Trump	Fiftythousand great troops.
0285	Donald Trump	That's true.
0286	Donald Trump	Yeah, it did  abduction.
0287	Donald Trump	Absolutely.
0288	Donald Trump	This is Prime Minister Abe's  one of his, certainly  other than the whole denuking subject  certainly his, I would say, his main point.
0289	Donald Trump	And I brought it up.
0290	Donald Trump	Absolutely.
0291	Donald Trump	And they're going to be working on that.
0292	Donald Trump	It will be  we didn't put it down in the document, but it will be worked on.
0293	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]
0294	Donald Trump	Christians, yes.
0295	Donald Trump	We are  brought it up very strongly.
0296	Donald Trump	You know, Franklin Graham spent  spent and spends a tremendous amount of time in North Korea.
0297	Donald Trump	He's got it very close to his heart.
0298	Donald Trump	It did come up, and things will be happening.
0299	Donald Trump	Okay?
0300	Donald Trump	Thank you.
0301	Donald Trump	Great question.
0302	Donald Trump	Yes, Jon.
0303	Donald Trump	Go ahead.
0304	Question	Thank you, Mr. President.
0305	Donald Trump	Thank you, Jon.
0306	Question	Returning to the question of human rights, you spoke very powerfully on the issue during your State of the Union Address.
0307	Question	You showed that  you had the defector in the First Lady's box with the crutches, who escaped.
0308	Question	And you, at that point, said that North Korea has more brutally oppressed its people than any other regime on Earth.
0309	Question	Do you still believe that is the case having sat down with Kim Jong Un?
0310	Question	And does he need to change that?
0311	Donald Trump	Right.
0312	Donald Trump	Jon, I believe it's a rough situation over there.
0313	Donald Trump	There's no question about it.
0314	Donald Trump	And we did discuss it today pretty strongly.
0315	Donald Trump	I mean, knowing what the main purpose of what we were doing is denuking.
0316	Donald Trump	But discussed it at pretty good length.
0317	Donald Trump	We'll be doing something on it.
0318	Donald Trump	It's rough.
0319	Donald Trump	It's rough in a lot of places, by the way.
0320	Donald Trump	Not just there.
0321	Donald Trump	But it's rough, and we will continue that.
0322	Donald Trump	And I think, ultimately, we'll agree to something.
0323	Donald Trump	But it was discussed at length outside of the nuclear situation, one of the primary topics.
0324	Question	But do you think that needs to change to bring on this glorious new era you've talked about?
0325	Question	Are they going to have to 
0326	Donald Trump	I think it will change.
0327	Donald Trump	Yeah.
0328	Donald Trump	I think it probably has to, but I think it will.
0329	Donald Trump	Yeah.
0330	Donald Trump	Thank you.
0331	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.
0332	Donald Trump	Steve.
0333	Donald Trump	That's you, Steve?
0334	Donald Trump	Right there.
0335	Question	Yes, sir.
0336	Question	Thank you.
0337	Question	What timetable do you envision for their denuclearization?
0338	Question	And in the meantime, are you thinking about easing any sanctions?
0339	Donald Trump	Well, you know, scientifically, I've been watching and reading a lot about this, and it does take a long time to pull off complete denuclearization.
0340	Donald Trump	It takes a long time.
0341	Donald Trump	Scientifically, you have to wait certain periods of time, and a lot of things happen.
0342	Donald Trump	But
0343	Donald Trump	Having sat down with Kim Jong Un.
0344	Donald Trump	And does he have to change that?
0345	Donald Trump	Jon, I believe it's a rough situation over there.
0346	Donald Trump	There's no question about it.
0347	Donald Trump	And we did discuss it today pretty strongly.
0348	Donald Trump	I mean, knowing what  the main purpose of what we were doing is denuking.
0349	Donald Trump	But discussed at pretty good length.
0350	Donald Trump	We'll be doing something on it.
0351	Donald Trump	It's rough.
0352	Donald Trump	It's rough in a lot of places, by the way  not just there.
0353	Donald Trump	But it's rough.
0354	Donald Trump	And we will continue that, and I think, ultimately, we'll agree to something.
0355	Donald Trump	But it was discussed at length.
0356	Donald Trump	Outside of  outside of the nuclear situation, one of the primary topics.
0357	Question	But do you think that needs to change to bring on this glorious new era you've talked about?
0358	Question	Are they going to have to 
0359	Donald Trump	I think it will change, yeah.
0360	Donald Trump	I think it probably has to.
0361	Donald Trump	But I think it will.
0362	Donald Trump	Yeah.
0363	Donald Trump	Thank you.
0364	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.
0365	Donald Trump	Steve?
0366	Donald Trump	That's you, Steve?
0367	Donald Trump	Right there.
0368	Question	Yes, sir.
0369	Question	Thank you.
0370	Question	What timetable do you envision for their denuclearization?
0371	Question	And in the meantime, are you thinking about easing any sanctions?
0372	Donald Trump	Well, you know, scientifically, I've been watching and reading a lot about this, and it does take a long time to pull off complete denuclearization.
0373	Donald Trump	It takes a long time.
0374	Donald Trump	Scientifically, you have to wait certain periods of time, and a lot of things happen.
0375	Donald Trump	But despite that, once you start the process, it means it's pretty much over you can't use them.
0376	Donald Trump	That's the good news.
0377	Donald Trump	And that's going to start very  very soon.
0378	Donald Trump	I believe that's going to start very soon.
0379	Donald Trump	We will do it as fast as it can mechanically and physically be done, Steve.
0380	Question	And the sanctions?
0381	Donald Trump	The sanctions will come off when we are sure that the nukes are no longer a factor.
0382	Donald Trump	Sanctions played a big role, but they'll come off at that point.
0383	Donald Trump	I hope it's going to be soon, but they'll come off.
0384	Donald Trump	As you know, and as I've said, the sanctions right now remain.
0385	Donald Trump	But at a certain point, I actually look forward to taking them off.
0386	Donald Trump	And they'll come off when we know we're down the road  where it's not going to happen, nothing is going to happen.
0387	Donald Trump	Okay?
0388	Donald Trump	Yes, go ahead.
0389	Donald Trump	Please.
0390	Question	Thank you, Mr. President.
0391	Donald Trump	Thank you.
0392	Question	Congratulations on this historic summit.
0393	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.
0394	Donald Trump	Congratulations to everybody, by the way.
0395	Donald Trump	Congratulations to everybody.
0396	Donald Trump	Go ahead.
0397	Question	You signed a document with Kim Jong Un.
0398	Question	It's essentially a piece of paper.
0399	Question	Yesterday, we had a briefing from the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
0400	Question	He said the following "Many Presidents previously have signed off on pieces of paper only to find that the North Koreans either didn't promise what we thought they had, or actually reneged on those promises."
0401	Question	What makes this time different, Mr. President?
0402	Donald Trump	Well, you have a different administration.
0403	Donald Trump	You have a different President.
0404	Donald Trump	You have a different Secretary of State.
0405	Donald Trump	You have people that are  you know, it's very important to them.
0406	Donald Trump	And we get it done.
0407	Donald Trump	The other groups, maybe it wasn't a priority.
0408	Donald Trump	I don't think they could have done it if it was a priority, frankly.
0409	Donald Trump	I don't think they honestly could have done it even if it was a priority.
0410	Donald Trump	And it would have been easier back then.
0411	Donald Trump	It would have been  for me, it would have been much easier if this were 10 years ago or 5 years ago.
0412	Donald Trump	And I'm not just blaming President Obama.
0413	Donald Trump	I mean, this goes back  for 25 years, this should have happened.
0414	Donald Trump	I was given a very tough hand.
0415	Donald Trump	I was given this, I was given the Iran deal, and plenty of other problems.
0416	Donald Trump	But we are  we're doing really well.
0417	Donald Trump	And the Iran deal, I have to be honest, I did it because nuclear is always number one to me.
0418	Donald Trump	Nuclear is number one.
0419	Donald Trump	But on the Iran deal, I think Iran is a different country now than it was three or four months ago.
0420	Donald Trump	I don't think they're looking so much to the Mediterranean.
0421	Donald Trump	I don't think they're looking so much at Syria, like they were, with total confidence.
0422	Donald Trump	I don't think they're so confident right now.
0423	Donald Trump	But I hope  with that being said, I hope that, at the appropriate time, after these sanctions kick in  and they are brutal, what we've put on Iran  I hope that they're going to come back and negotiate a real deal, because I'd love to be able to do that.
0424	Donald Trump	But right now, it's too soon for that.
0425	Donald Trump	Yes, please.
0426	Question	Mr. President, you also didn't talk about establishing diplomatic relations, exchanging ambassadors.
0427	Question	How long before that happens?
0428	Donald Trump	Good question.
0429	Donald Trump	Hopefully soon.
0430	Donald Trump	But we'll have to get things moving first.
0431	Donald Trump	Very  a little bit early for that.
0432	Donald Trump	We have to get things moving.
0433	Donald Trump	Yes, go ahead.
0434	Donald Trump	Hi.
0435	Question	Can you clarify, when you said you were stopping "war games," so you are stopping the military exercises with South Korea?
0436	Donald Trump	Yeah, we've done exercises for a long period of time, working with South Korea.
0437	Donald Trump	And we call them "war games," and I call them "war games."
0438	Donald Trump	And they're tremendously expensive.
0439	Donald Trump	The amount of money that we spend on that is incredible.
0440	Donald Trump	And South Korea contributes, but not 100 percent, which is certainly a subject that we have to talk to them about also.
0441	Donald Trump	And that has to do with the military expense and also the trade.
0442	Donald Trump	So we're doing that.
0443	Donald Trump	We actually have a new deal with South Korea, in terms of the trade deal, but we have to talk to them.
0444	Donald Trump	We have to talk to many countries about treating us fairly.
0445	Donald Trump	But the war games are very expensive.
0446	Donald Trump	We pay for a big majority of them.
0447	Donald Trump	We fly in bombers from Guam.
0448	Donald Trump	I said  when I first started, I said, "Where do the bombers come from?"
0449	Donald Trump	Guam.
0450	Donald Trump	Nearby.
0451	Donald Trump	I said, "Oh, great, nearby.
0452	Donald Trump	Where's nearby?"
0453	Donald Trump	Six and a half hours.
0454	Donald Trump	Six and a half hours  that's a long time for these big massive planes to be flying to South Korea to practice and then drop bombs all over the place, and then go back to Guam.
0455	Donald Trump	I know a lot about airplanes it's very expensive.
0456	Donald Trump	And I didn't like it.
0457	Donald Trump	And what I did say is  and I think it's very provocative, I have to tell you, Jennifer, it's a very provocative situation when I see that, and you have a country right next door.
0458	Donald Trump	So under the circumstances that we are negotiating a very comprehensive, complete deal, I think it's inappropriate to be having war games.
0459	Donald Trump	So, number one, we save money  a lot.
0460	Donald Trump	And number two, it really is something that I think they very much appreciate it.
0461	Question	Does North Korea give you something in return, though?
0462	Donald Trump	Well, we've gotten  you know, I've heard that.
0463	Donald Trump	I mean, some of the people that  I don't know, maybe they really mean it.
0464	Donald Trump	I don't always want to go against the press because I just don't  especially not today, this is too important.
0465	Donald Trump	But I noticed that some of the people were saying that the President has agreed to meet, he has given up so much.
0466	Donald Trump	I gave up nothing.
0467	Donald Trump	I'm here.
0468	Donald Trump	I haven't slept in 25 hours, but I thought it was appropriate to do  because we have been negotiating for literally around the clock with them, and with us, and with John, and with Mike, and a whole team of very talented people.
0469	Donald Trump	But we haven't given up anything, other than  you're right, I agreed to meet.
0470	Donald Trump	And I think the meeting was every bit as good for the United States as it was for North Korea.
0471	Donald Trump	But I just wrote down some of the things we got.
0472	Donald Trump	And they  you know, they  sure, they got a meeting.
0473	Donald Trump	But only a person that dislikes Donald Trump would say that I've agreed to make a big commitment.
0474	Donald Trump	Sure, I've agreed to take a period of time and come here and meet, and that's good.
0475	Donald Trump	But I think it's great for us, as a country, and I think it's good for them.
0476	Donald Trump	But what did they do to justify this meeting?
0477	Donald Trump	Secured commitment for complete denuclearization that's the big thing.
0478	Donald Trump	They secured the release of three American hostages.
0479	Donald Trump	They already gave them to us two months ago.
0480	Donald Trump	These people are now living happily back in their homes, with their families.
0481	Donald Trump	And it was pretty rough for them, to put it mildly.
0482	Donald Trump	Secure the commitment to recover the remains, including  these are of fallen heroes.
0483	Donald Trump	And they're giving a commitment, they're starting it immediately, to recover their remains.
0484	Donald Trump	And I just went through how many people asked me about it.
0485	Donald Trump	I was amazed, actually.
0486	Donald Trump	So many people would ask me, "Is it possible?
0487	Donald Trump	Is it possible?"
0488	Donald Trump	At that time we had no relationship to Chairman Kim or to anybody else in North Korea.
0489	Donald Trump	You know, it was a very closed society.
0490	Donald Trump	So we're getting the remains back.
0491	Donald Trump	Secured the halt of all missile and nuclear tests for  how long has it been?
0492	Donald Trump	Seven months?
0493	Donald Trump	You haven't had a missile go up.
0494	Donald Trump	For seven months, you haven't had a nuclear test you haven't had a nuclear explosion.
0495	Donald Trump	I remember a nuclear event took place  8.8 in the Richter scale.
0496	Donald Trump	And they announced  I heard it on the radio  they announced that a massive  you know, an earthquake took place somewhere in Asia.
0497	Donald Trump	And then they said it was in North Korea.
0498	Donald Trump	And then they found out it was a nuclear test.
0499	Donald Trump	I said, "I never heard of a Richter scale in the high 8s."
0500	Donald Trump	And if you look, there has been no missile launches.
0501	Donald Trump	They've blown up their missile area.
0502	Donald Trump	That's going to take place.
0503	Donald Trump	That has not been written into the contract.
0504	Donald Trump	We're going to give you the exact details on that.
0505	Donald Trump	But they secured a halt of all missiles and of all nuclear tests.
0506	Donald Trump	They secured the closure of their single primary nuclear test site.
0507	Donald Trump	All three of them  they're in an area that's common around each other  they secured the closure.
0508	Donald Trump	They secured the commitment to destroy the missile engine testing site.
0509	Donald Trump	That was not in your agreement.
0510	Donald Trump	I got that after we signed the agreement.
0511	Donald Trump	I said, "Do me a favor.
0512	Donald Trump	You've got this missile engine testing site.
0513	Donald Trump	We know where it is because of the heat."
0514	Donald Trump	It's incredible the equipment we have, to be honest with you.
0515	Donald Trump	I said, "Can you close it up?"
0516	Donald Trump	He's going to close it up.
0517	Donald Trump	We maintained the ability to continue to apply sanctions.
0518	Donald Trump	So we're applying sanctions.
0519	Donald Trump	Now I had 300 sanctions that I was getting ready to put on last week.
0520	Donald Trump	And I said, you know, I can't really put on sanctions when I'm meeting with  I thought it would be very disrespectful.
0521	Donald Trump	Three hundred very big ones, powerful ones.
0522	Donald Trump	And I said it would be disrespectful.
0523	Donald Trump	So, Jennifer, when you look at all of those things that we got  and when we got our hostages back, I didn't pay $1.8 billion in cash like the hostages that came back from Iran, which was a disgraceful situation, what took place.
0524	Donald Trump	So we've gotten a lot.
0525	Donald Trump	So when I hear somebody in the media say that President Trump has agreed to meet  like, it's not a big deal to meet.
0526	Donald Trump	I think we should meet on a lot of different topics, not just this one.
0527	Donald Trump	And I really believe a lot of great things can happen.
0528	Donald Trump	Yes.
0529	Donald Trump	Go ahead, please.
0530	Question	Sir, you just listed off a lot of things that you say you got in this meeting.
0531	Question	It wasn't too long ago, though, that you said you defined the success of this meeting by North Korea giving up its nuclear weapons.
0532	Donald Trump	Well, that's what they're doing.
0533	Question	Well, can you talk about how 
0534	Donald Trump	Sure.
0535	Donald Trump	That's what they're doing.
0536	Donald Trump	I mean, I don't think the 
0537	Question	 how you pressed Kim Jong Un for complete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearization?
0538	Donald Trump	Yeah, I did, honestly 
0539	Question	And can you why you didn't secure those details in this agreement?
0540	Donald Trump	Because there was no time.
0541	Donald Trump	I'm here one day.
0542	Donald Trump	We're together for many hours intensively, but the process is now going to take place.
0543	Donald Trump	And I would be surprised, Mike, if they haven't even started already.
0544	Donald Trump	They have started they blew up their sites.
0545	Donald Trump	They blew up their testing site.
0546	Donald Trump	But I will say, he knew, prior to coming  you know, this wasn't like a surprise.
0547	Donald Trump	It wasn't like we've never discussed it.
0548	Donald Trump	We discussed it.
0549	Donald Trump	Mike discussed it very strongly with his counterpart in North Korea.
0550	Donald Trump	They knew that this was  let's say they didn't agree to that I couldn't sign any agreement.
0551	Donald Trump	There was no agreement that could have been signed.
0552	Donald Trump	So they understood that.
0553	Donald Trump	And it wasn't a big point today because, really, this had been taken care of, more than any other thing.
0554	Donald Trump	Because it was all about this.
0555	Donald Trump	This has been taken care of before we got here.
0556	Donald Trump	So when we brought that up today, you see the language.
0557	Donald Trump	It's very strong.
0558	Donald Trump	It's in the document.
0559	Donald Trump	Yes, ma'am.
0560	Question	Thank you, Mr. President.
0561	Question	Could you talk about the military consequences for North Korea if they don't follow through on the commitments that you're talking about?
0562	Question	Could there be military action?
0563	Donald Trump	Well, I don't want to talk.
0564	Donald Trump	Yeah, I know.
0565	Donald Trump	That's a tough thing to talk about because I don't want to be threatening.
0566	Donald Trump	I don't want to be threatening.
0567	Donald Trump	They understood that.
0568	Donald Trump	And you've seen what was, perhaps, going to happen.
0569	Donald Trump	And you know, Seoul has 28 million people.
0570	Donald Trump	We think we have big cities.
0571	Donald Trump	You look at New York, where it has 8 million people.
0572	Donald Trump	We think it's a big city.
0573	Donald Trump	Seoul has 28 million people.
0574	Donald Trump	Think of that.
0575	Donald Trump	And it's right next to the border.
0576	Donald Trump	It's right next to the DMZ.
0577	Donald Trump	It's right there.
0578	Donald Trump	I mean, if this would have happened, I think  you know, I've heard, oh, a hundredthousand people.
0579	Donald Trump	I think you could have lost 20 million people, 30 million people.
0580	Donald Trump	This is really an honor for me to be doing this because I think, you know, potentially, you could have lost, you know, 30, 40, 50 million people.
0581	Donald Trump	The city of Seoul, one of the biggest cities in the world, is right next to the border.
0582	Question	You once spoke about fire and fury.
0583	Question	Is that no longer the case?
0584	Donald Trump	Well, at that time we needed, perhaps, fire and fury.
0585	Donald Trump	Because we could not have allowed that kind of capability from the standpoint of the United States.
0586	Donald Trump	And certainly, Japan wasn't going to allow it either.
0587	Donald Trump	Japan is right next door.
0588	Question	One more thing.
0589	Question	Mr. President, could you tell us about the video that you showed before this?
0590	Donald Trump	Yeah.
0591	Question	When did you show that to Kim?
0592	Question	What was the goal there?
0593	Donald Trump	Today.
0594	Donald Trump	Yeah, we had it made up by some  I hope you liked it.
0595	Donald Trump	I thought it was good.
0596	Donald Trump	I thought it was interesting enough to show.
0597	Donald Trump	One in English and one in Korean.
0598	Donald Trump	And we had it made up.
0599	Donald Trump	I showed it to him today.
0600	Donald Trump	Actually, during the meeting  toward the end of the meeting.
0601	Donald Trump	And I think he loved it.
0602	Donald Trump	They were giving  we didn't have a big screen like you have the luxury of having.
0603	Donald Trump	We didn't need it because we had it on a cassette and  an iPad.
0604	Donald Trump	And they played it.
0605	Donald Trump	And about eight of their representatives were watching it, and I thought they were fascinated.
0606	Donald Trump	But I thought it was well done.
0607	Donald Trump	I showed it to you because that's the future.
0608	Donald Trump	I mean, that could very well be the future.
0609	Donald Trump	And the other alternative is just not a very good alternative.
0610	Donald Trump	It's just not good.
0611	Donald Trump	But I showed it because I really want him to do something.
0612	Donald Trump	Now, I don't think I had to show it because I really believe he wants to  I think he wants to get it done.
0613	Donald Trump	Yes.
0614	Donald Trump	Go ahead.
0615	Donald Trump	How's Staten Island Ferry doing?
0616	Donald Trump	Okay?
0617	Donald Trump	He wrote the best story about me with the Staten Island Ferry.
0618	Donald Trump	And after that, he's never written a good story.
0619	Question	That's a long time ago, sir.
0620	Donald Trump	I don't know what happened.
0621	Donald Trump	It's a long time ago.
0622	Question	Mr. President, it's been a busy week for you on the international stage.
0623	Question	You're leaving this summit here in Singapore having determined that Kim Jong Un is a talented man.
0624	Question	You left the G7 Summit a few days ago in Canada having determined that Prime Minister Trudeau is weak and dishonest.
0625	Question	What do you say to America's allies who worry that you might be jeopardizing our longterm alliances and who worry that you might be treating our historic friends as enemies and our historic enemies as friends?
0626	Donald Trump	Well, first of all, I think it's a very fair question.
0627	Donald Trump	I had a very good meeting with the G7.
0628	Donald Trump	And I left the meeting.
0629	Donald Trump	And, I'll be honest, we are being taken advantage of by virtually every one of those countries.
0630	Donald Trump	Very, very seriously.
0631	Donald Trump	Now, the United States, because of bad management at the top, because of Presidents that didn't care about trade or didn't understand it or whatever reason.
0632	Donald Trump	For many years, with China being, obviously, the most successful at it, but the European Union is second  $151 billion we lost.
0633	Donald Trump	They were represented at the meeting.
0634	Donald Trump	And we're being taken advantage of on trade.
0635	Donald Trump	Canada does have very big advantages over us in terms of trade deficits.
0636	Donald Trump	We have a big trade deficit with Canada, I was reading, where, oh, it's actually a surplus.
0637	Donald Trump	Not a surplus.
0638	Donald Trump	It's either 17, but it could actually be 100.
0639	Donald Trump	You know, they put out a document.
0640	Donald Trump	I don't know if you saw it.
0641	Donald Trump	They didn't want me to see it, but we found it.
0642	Donald Trump	Perhaps they were trying to show the power they have.
0643	Donald Trump	It's close to $100 billion a year loss with Canada.
0644	Donald Trump	They don't take our farm products  many of them.
0645	Donald Trump	They charge what was 270 percent, but somebody told me the other day that a few months ago they raised it to 295 percent for dairy products.
0646	Donald Trump	And it's very unfair to our farmers, and it's very unfair to the people of our country  the workers, the farmers, the companies.
0647	Donald Trump	And we are not able to trade.
0648	Donald Trump	They have tremendous barriers up.
0649	Donald Trump	They have tremendous tariffs.
0650	Donald Trump	So when I put in a countervailing tariff just to get us up a little bit so the balance isn't so much  it's like this  they said, "Oh, that's so terrible."
0651	Donald Trump	I said, "What's terrible?"
0652	Donald Trump	We have to catch you a little bit.
0653	Donald Trump	We have to have a little balance.
0654	Donald Trump	Even if it's not complete, we have to have a little balance.
0655	Donald Trump	I say this with many countries.
0656	Donald Trump	Anyway, we came  we finished the meeting.
0657	Donald Trump	Really, everybody was happy.
0658	Donald Trump	And I agreed to sign something.
0659	Donald Trump	I asked for changes I demanded changes.
0660	Donald Trump	And those changes were made.
0661	Donald Trump	In fact, the picture with Angela Merkel, who I get along with very well, where I'm sitting there like this, that picture was we're waiting for the document because I wanted to see the final document as changed by the changes that I requested.
0662	Donald Trump	That was a very friendly  I know it didn't look friendly, and I know it was reported like sort of nasty both ways.
0663	Donald Trump	I was angry at her or she  actually, we were just talking, the whole group, about something unrelated to everything, very friendly, waiting for the document to come back so I could read it before I leave.
0664	Donald Trump	Anyway, I left and it was very friendly.
0665	Donald Trump	When I got onto the plane, I think that Justin probably didn't know that Air Force One has about 20 televisions, and I see the television.
0666	Donald Trump	And he's giving a news conference about how he will not be pushed around by the United States.
0667	Donald Trump	And I say, push him around?
0668	Donald Trump	We just shook hands.
0669	Donald Trump	It was very friendly.
0670	Donald Trump	Look, countries cannot continue to take advantage of us on trade.
0671	Donald Trump	The number are out.
0672	Donald Trump	Over the last couple of years, and over the last many years  but over the last couple of years, this country has lost $800 billion on trade with other countries, the biggest one being China.
0673	Donald Trump	Eighthundred billion dollars.
0674	Donald Trump	A hundred fiftyone billion with the European Union.
0675	Donald Trump	They don't take our agricultural products, barely.
0676	Donald Trump	They don't take a lot of what we have, and yet they send Mercedes into us, they send BMWs into us by the millions.
0677	Donald Trump	It's very unfair, and it's very unfair to our workers.
0678	Donald Trump	And I'm going to straighten it out.
0679	Donald Trump	And it won't even be tough.
0680	Donald Trump	Okay?
0681	Donald Trump	Thank you.
0682	Donald Trump	Go ahead.
0683	Donald Trump	Go ahead.

0685	Donald Trump	I would like to involve Congress, yes.
0686	Donald Trump	And no, I have a good relationship with Justin Trudeau.
0687	Donald Trump	I really did.
0688	Donald Trump	Other than he had a news conference that he had because he assumed I was in an airplane and I wasn't watching.
0689	Donald Trump	He learned.
0690	Donald Trump	That's going to cost a lot of money for the people of Canada.
0691	Donald Trump	He learned.
0692	Donald Trump	You can't do that.
0693	Donald Trump	You can't do that.
0694	Donald Trump	We laughed.
0695	Donald Trump	We had a very good relationship.
0696	Donald Trump	I've had a good relationship with Justin.
0697	Donald Trump	I have a good relationship with all.
0698	Donald Trump	I have a very good relationship with Angela Merkel.
0699	Donald Trump	But on NATO, we're paying 4.2 percent she's paying 1 percent of a much smaller GDP than we have.
0700	Donald Trump	We're paying 4.2 percent on a much larger  we're paying for  I mean, anyone can say  from 60 to 90 percent of NATO.
0701	Donald Trump	And we're protecting countries of Europe.
0702	Donald Trump	And then on top of it, they kill us on trade.
0703	Donald Trump	So we just can't have it that way.
0704	Donald Trump	It's unfair to our taxpayers and to our people.
0705	Donald Trump	But no, I have a good relationship with Justin.
0706	Donald Trump	And I have a, I think, a very good relationship with Chairman Kim right now.
0707	Donald Trump	I really do.
0708	Donald Trump	I think  I hope it's good because if it is, we're going to solve a very big problem.
0709	Donald Trump	I think we've gone a long way to solving it today.
0710	Donald Trump	Should we keep going for a little while?
0711	Donald Trump	Sarah?
0712	Donald Trump	I don't know.
0713	Donald Trump	It's up to the legendary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.
0714	Donald Trump	Should we keep going, Sarah?
0715	Donald Trump	Okay, we'll go.
0716	Donald Trump	Well, I don't care.
0717	Donald Trump	Hey, you know, it just means we get home a little later in the evening.
0718	Donald Trump	Right?
0719	Donald Trump	Yeah.
0720	Donald Trump	Go ahead.
0721	Donald Trump	Sure.
0722	Donald Trump	Go ahead.
0723	Donald Trump	Go ahead.
0724	Question	Hi, Mr. President.
0725	Donald Trump	How are you?
0726	Question	I'm good.
0727	Donald Trump	Nice to see you.
0728	Question	From The Straits Times of Singapore.
0729	Question	Welcome to the country.
0730	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.
0731	Question	I hope you enjoyed our food.
0732	Donald Trump	Beautiful country.
0733	Donald Trump	I did.
0734	Question	I just wanted to find out.
0735	Question	You described this as a process.
0736	Question	What is the immediate next step?
0737	Question	Is there some ongoing dialogue 
0738	Donald Trump	Yes.
0739	Donald Trump	We're getting together next week to go into the details. And that's
0740	SYSTEM	[inaudible]
0741	Donald Trump	?
0742	Donald Trump	Secretary Pompeo.
0743	Donald Trump	Yeah.
0744	Donald Trump	Next week, with John Bolton and our entire team, to go over the details and to get this stuff done.
0745	Donald Trump	We want to get it done he wants to get it done.
0746	Donald Trump	We're also working very much with South Korea.
0747	Donald Trump	We're working with Japan.
0748	Donald Trump	We're working with China, to a lesser extent, but we're working with China.
0749	Question	And you are coming back to Singapore?
0750	Donald Trump	I would come back gladly.
0751	Donald Trump	Your Prime Minister was fantastic.
0752	Donald Trump	We were with him yesterday.
0753	Donald Trump	He's done a great job.
0754	Donald Trump	It was very welcoming.
0755	Donald Trump	It really, probably had  it probably made a difference, actually.
0756	Donald Trump	It's a great place.
0757	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.
0758	Question	Thank you, Mr. President.
0759	Donald Trump	Yes, ma'am.
0760	Question	Thank you, Mr. President.
0761	Question	What was it about that first interaction with Chairman Kim this morning that that made you decide not to walk away after you said that you would know within the first minute if he was sincere or not?
0762	Donald Trump	Yeah.
0763	Donald Trump	I've said that about relationships.
0764	Donald Trump	I've said that about people.
0765	Donald Trump	You know in the first second.
0766	Donald Trump	Now, I was generous.
0767	Donald Trump	I said five seconds.
0768	Donald Trump	But you know in the first second, in some cases.
0769	Donald Trump	Sometimes that doesn't work out.
0770	Donald Trump	But sometimes it does.
0771	Donald Trump	From the beginning, we got along.
0772	Donald Trump	But there's been a lot of groundwork.
0773	Donald Trump	This wasn't like we went and we started talking about  as you know, right?
0774	Donald Trump	We didn't just come in and start talking about these very complex subjects that have been going on for 70 years.
0775	Donald Trump	We've been discussing this for months.
0776	Donald Trump	And, you know, once the rhetoric stopped, once they did a great thing you know, North Korea did a great thing by going to the Olympics.
0777	Donald Trump	Because the Olympics  and President Moon will tell you this  the Olympics was not exactly doing great.
0778	Donald Trump	People didn't feel like being bombed out of the Opening Ceremonies.
0779	Donald Trump	You know, they weren't exactly selling tickets.
0780	Donald Trump	And as soon as the Chairman  Chairman Kim  said, "Let's participate in the Olympics," it sold like wildfire and was a great success as an Olympics.
0781	Donald Trump	It was a great success.
0782	Donald Trump	He did a great thing.
0783	Donald Trump	But since that time, pretty much since that time  because, as you know, a delegation came from South Korea who had just met with North Korea.
0784	Donald Trump	They came to the White House.
0785	Donald Trump	They told me lots of things, including the fact that they'd be willing to denuke.
0786	Donald Trump	We have one of their great people here today.
0787	Donald Trump	That they were willing to denuke.
0788	Donald Trump	And once that started, we have been really talking about that from the end of the Olympics when the whole delegation came to say various things, including denuking.
0789	Question	If I may, a second question.
0790	Question	In the document that you signed earlier today, North Korea agreed to commit to denuclearization.
0791	Question	To borrow a phrase that you have used to criticize your predecessors and political opponents, how do you ensure that North Korea is not all talk, no action going forward?
0792	Donald Trump	Well, I think can you ensure anything?
0793	Donald Trump	Can I ensure that you're going to be able to sit down properly when you sit down?
0794	Donald Trump	I mean, you can't ensure anything.
0795	Donald Trump	All I can say is they want to make a deal.
0796	Donald Trump	That's what I do.
0797	Donald Trump	My whole life has been deals.
0798	Donald Trump	I've done great at it, and that's what I do.
0799	Donald Trump	And I know when somebody wants to deal, and I know when somebody doesn't.
0800	Donald Trump	A lot of politicians don't.
0801	Donald Trump	That's not their thing, but it is my thing.
0802	Donald Trump	I mean, again, this really could have been done, I think, easier a long time ago.
0803	Donald Trump	But I know for a  I just feel very strongly  my instinct, my ability, or talent  they want to make a deal.
0804	Donald Trump	And making a deal is a great thing for the world.
0805	Donald Trump	It's also a great thing for China because I can't imagine that China has, you know, is happy with somebody having nuclear weapons so close.
0806	Donald Trump	So, you know, that's  China was very helpful.
0807	Donald Trump	So I think he wants to make a deal.
0808	Donald Trump	Can anybody be certain?
0809	Donald Trump	But we're going to be certain soon because the negotiations continue.
0810	Donald Trump	Okay?
0811	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.
0812	Donald Trump	Go ahead.
0813	Question	You mentioned that you have raised extensively the issue of human rights with Chairman Kim.
0814	Donald Trump	Yes.
0815	Question	I wonder what you would say to the group of people who have no ability whatsoever to hear or to see this press conference  the 100,000 North Koreans kept in a network of gulags.
0816	Question	Have you betrayed them by legitimizing the regime in Pyongyang?
0817	Donald Trump	No, I think I've helped them because I think things will change.
0818	Donald Trump	I think I've helped them.
0819	Donald Trump	There's nothing I can say.
0820	Donald Trump	All I can do is do what I can do.
0821	Donald Trump	We have to stop the nuclearization.
0822	Donald Trump	We have to do other things, and that's a very important thing.
0823	Donald Trump	So at a certain point, hopefully, you'll be able to ask me a much more positive question or make a statement.
0824	Donald Trump	But not much I can do right now.
0825	Donald Trump	At a certain point, I really believe he's going to do things about it.
0826	Donald Trump	I think they are one of the great winners today, that large group of people that you're talking about.
0827	Donald Trump	I think, ultimately, they're going to be one of the great winners as a group.
0828	Donald Trump	Yes, sir.
0829	Donald Trump	Go ahead.
0830	Donald Trump	Go ahead.
0831	Donald Trump	Yeah.
0832	Question	Would you ever consider removing the sanctions without significant improvement in the human rights situation?
0833	Donald Trump	No.
0834	Donald Trump	I want significant improvement.
0835	Donald Trump	I want to know that it won't be happening.
0836	Donald Trump	And again, once you start that process, there will be a point at which, even though you won't be finished for a while because it can't happen scientifically or mechanically, but you're not going to be able to go back.
0837	Donald Trump	You know, once we reach that point, I'll start to give that very serious thought.
0838	Donald Trump	Yes.
0839	Donald Trump	Go ahead.
0840	Donald Trump	Go ahead.
0841	Donald Trump	Go ahead.
0842	Donald Trump	You first.
0843	Question	Mr. President, did you also discuss the cost of denuclearization and how North Korea is about to foot the bill while the crippling sanctions remain in place? I'm from
0844	SYSTEM	[inaudible]
0845	Question	News Agency Singapore.
0846	Donald Trump	Well, I think that South Korea and I think that Japan will help them very greatly.
0847	Donald Trump	I think they're prepared to help them.
0848	Donald Trump	They know they're going to have to help them.
0849	Donald Trump	I think they're going to help them very greatly.
0850	Donald Trump	We won't have to help them.
0851	Donald Trump	The United States has been paying a big price in a lot of different places.
0852	Donald Trump	But South Korea, which obviously is right next door, and Japan, which essentially is next door, they're going to be helping them.
0853	Donald Trump	And I think they're going to be doing a very generous job and a terrific job.
0854	Donald Trump	So they will be helping them.
0855	Donald Trump	Yes, ma'am.
0856	Donald Trump	Go ahead.
0857	Donald Trump	Behind.
0858	Donald Trump	Yes.
0859	Question	Thank you, Mr. President.
0860	Donald Trump	Thank you.
0861	Question	I'd like to follow up on Steve's question.
0862	Question	He asked you how long it would take to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula.
0863	Question	You said a long time.
0864	Question	What does that mean?
0865	Donald Trump	Well, I don't know, when you say a long time.
0866	Donald Trump	I think we will do it as fast as it can be done scientifically, as fast as it can be done mechanically.
0867	Donald Trump	I don't think  I mean, I've read horror stories.
0868	Donald Trump	It's a 15year process.
0869	Donald Trump	Okay?
0870	Donald Trump	Assuming you wanted to do it quickly, I don't believe that.
0871	Donald Trump	I think whoever wrote that is wrong.
0872	Donald Trump	But there will be a point at which, when you're 20 percent through, you can't go back.
0873	Donald Trump	I had an uncle who was a great professor for, I believe, 40 years at MIT.
0874	Donald Trump	And I used to discuss nuclear with him all the time.
0875	Donald Trump	He was a great expert.
0876	Donald Trump	He was a great, brilliant genius.
0877	Donald Trump	Dr. John Trump at MIT.
0878	Donald Trump	I think he was there 40 years, I was told.
0879	Donald Trump	In fact, the head of MIT sent me a book on my uncle.
0880	Donald Trump	But we used to talk about nuclear.
0881	Donald Trump	You're talking about a very complex subject.
0882	Donald Trump	It's not just like, "Oh, gee.
0883	Donald Trump	Let's get rid of the nukes."
0884	Donald Trump	It takes a period of time.
0885	Donald Trump	But the main period of time that I'm talking is that first period, when you hit a certain point you can't go back.
0886	Donald Trump	It's very hard to go back.
0887	Question	And how long will that take?
0888	Donald Trump	We don't know, but it will go pretty quickly.
0889	Donald Trump	Go ahead.
0890	Donald Trump	Sure.
0891	Question	Thanks, Mr. President.
0892	Question	I wanted to ask again on the sanctions campaign.
0893	Donald Trump	Yeah.
0894	Question	You alluded at the very beginning that the Chinese are not doing as great a job securing the border as they were before.
0895	Question	You expressed some doubts when Kim went to see President Xi.
0896	Question	The Russian foreign minister was in Pyongyang and said there shouldn't be any sanctions while these negotiations are under way.
0897	Question	And the South Koreans are now talking about restoring some form of trade.
0898	Question	So with all of those players appearing to be moving toward eroding sanctions, how can you keep the sanctions regime in place?
0899	Question	What leverage do you have on these countries?
0900	Donald Trump	Well, I think we have a lot of leverage.
0901	Donald Trump	I think we have tremendous leverage.
0902	Donald Trump	I do believe that China, despite my relationship with President Xi  a man who I told you I have great respect for and like, also, a lot.
0903	Donald Trump	You know, we're having very tough talks on trade.
0904	Donald Trump	And I think that probably affects China somewhat.
0905	Donald Trump	But I have to do what I have to do.
0906	Donald Trump	And I think, over the last two months, the border is more open than it was when we first started.
0907	Donald Trump	But that is what it is.
0908	Donald Trump	We have to do it.
0909	Donald Trump	We have a tremendous deficit in trade, commonly known as a trade deficit.
0910	Donald Trump	We have a tremendous deficit in trade with China, and we have to do something about it.
0911	Donald Trump	We can't continue to let that happen.
0912	Donald Trump	And I think that has had an impact on my relationship, in terms of the border.
0913	Donald Trump	I don't think it has the relationship  you know, I don't think it affects my feeling or my relationship to President Xi.
0914	Donald Trump	But when we first started, we weren't ready to go that route.
0915	Donald Trump	And as we started preparing and getting ready to do that, I think that's had an impact on, frankly, the border.
0916	Donald Trump	Which is a shame.
0917	Donald Trump	But I have to do it.
0918	Donald Trump	I have no choice.
0919	Donald Trump	For our country, I have to do it.
0920	Donald Trump	South Korea will do whatever is necessary to get a deal done.
0921	Donald Trump	And if that means we can't trade, then I'm not going to trade.
0922	Donald Trump	They're definitely not going to trade.
0923	Donald Trump	If they think  and they would do this with our concurrence  if they think that they can do some work because we're very far down the line  we're actually very far.
0924	Donald Trump	You know, that document, when you read it today, that's far down the line.
0925	Donald Trump	That's not something that just happened to be put together.
0926	Donald Trump	This was done over months.
0927	Donald Trump	And again, the rhetoric was important, and the sanctions were important.
0928	Donald Trump	I don't even know which one was more important.
0929	Donald Trump	They were both important.
0930	Donald Trump	Yeah.
0931	Donald Trump	Go ahead.
0932	Question	Mr. President, David Sanger for The New York Times.
0933	Question	I was wondering if you could give us some sense of whether the Chairman Kim told you how many nuclear weapons he believes he's made, whether he's willing to turn those over first, and then whether, in your mind, you need to do more than was done in the Iran deal for actually dismantling the  both the uranium and the plutonium processes.
0934	Question	And whether or not you had a sense that Chairman Kim really understood what that involves and had a timetable in his own mind of shutting that.
0935	Donald Trump	Well, David, I can tell you he understands.
0936	Donald Trump	He understands it so well.
0937	Donald Trump	He understands it better than the people that are doing the work for him.
0938	Donald Trump	That is an easy one.
0939	Donald Trump	As far as what he has, it's substantial.
0940	Donald Trump	Very substantial.
0941	Donald Trump	The timing will go quickly.
0942	Donald Trump	I believe you'll see some good action.
0943	Donald Trump	I mean, as an example, one of the things with the missile site, I think you're probably surprised to hear that  that was a throwin at the end, the missile site.
0944	Donald Trump	But I really believe, David, that it's going to go very quickly.
0945	Donald Trump	I really believe that it's going to go fast.
0946	Donald Trump	And it is a very substantial arsenal.
0947	Donald Trump	There's no question about it.
0948	Donald Trump	You know, I used to say maybe it's all talk and no action.
0949	Donald Trump	But we have pretty good intelligence into that.
0950	Donald Trump	Although, probably less there than any other country.
0951	Donald Trump	You understand that maybe better than anybody in the room.
0952	Donald Trump	Probably less there than any other country.
0953	Donald Trump	But we have enough intelligence to know that what they have is very substantial.
0954	Donald Trump	This is why, David, I always say that this shouldn't have taken place so late into the process.
0955	Donald Trump	Wouldn't this have been better if it was 5 years ago or 20 years ago or 15 years ago and we didn't have to worry about not having a successful meeting like today?
0956	Donald Trump	So  and I still love my first interview with you, David.
0957	Donald Trump	I still have that interview, actually.
0958	Donald Trump	Yeah.
0959	Donald Trump	Go ahead.
0960	Question	Thank you, Mr. President.
0961	Donald Trump	Thank you.
0962	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]
0963	Donald Trump	the second summit  if there is a second summit with Chairman Kim Jong Un, would it be in Pyongyang or Washington?
0964	Donald Trump	We haven't set that up.
0965	Donald Trump	We'll probably need another summit.
0966	Donald Trump	We'll probably need  or meeting.
0967	Donald Trump	We can use a different term.
0968	Donald Trump	But we'll probably need another one.
0969	Donald Trump	We'll probably  I will say this, we're much further along than I would have thought.
0970	Donald Trump	I did not think we'd be here.
0971	Donald Trump	I thought  and I've told people  I didn't want to build up people's hopes too much.
0972	Donald Trump	I told people I thought that this would be a successful meeting if we got along, we developed a relationship, and we could have maybe gotten to this point in three or four months from now.
0973	Donald Trump	But it really happened very quickly.
0974	Donald Trump	A lot of that was because of the foundation that was, you know, put down before we met.
0975	Donald Trump	A lot of things happened very fast.
0976	Donald Trump	We didn't have  as an example, bringing back the remains.
0977	Donald Trump	That was not one of the things that was on our agenda today.
0978	Donald Trump	I brought that up at the very end because so many people have talked to me about it.
0979	Donald Trump	And I brought it up at the very end.
0980	Donald Trump	And he was really very gracious.
0981	Donald Trump	Instead of saying, "Well, let's talk about it the next time."
0982	Donald Trump	He said, "It makes sense.
0983	Donald Trump	We will do it."
0984	Donald Trump	And he knew  you know, they know where many of those incredible people are.
0985	Donald Trump	Where they're buried along roads, along highways, along paths, usually, because our soldiers were moving back and forth and they had to move rapidly.
0986	Donald Trump	It's very sad.
0987	Donald Trump	But he knew.
0988	Donald Trump	And that was brought up at the very end.
0989	Donald Trump	And you know, it was really great that he was able to do it.
0990	Donald Trump	A lot of people are going to be very happy about that.
0991	Donald Trump	Yes.
0992	Donald Trump	Go ahead, please.
0993	Question	Thank you, Mr. President.
0994	Donald Trump	Thank you.
0995	Question	Emerald Robinson, One America News.
0996	Question	Congratulations.
0997	Donald Trump	Thank you.
0998	Donald Trump	Thank you for the nice way you treat us.
0999	Donald Trump	We appreciate it.
1000	Donald Trump	Really, it's very good.
1001	Donald Trump	It's really beautiful what you do.
1002	Donald Trump	Go ahead.
1003	Question	So you 
1004	Donald Trump	And now I'll probably get this killer question.
1005	SYSTEM	[Laughs]
1006	Donald Trump	Well, I do want to talk about the future of North Korea.
1007	Donald Trump	Yeah.
1008	Donald Trump	It's all right.
1009	Question	Specifically the people are  Kim Jong Un is saying he's wanting a brighter future with prosperity for his people, yet we know they've lived under oppression.
1010	Question	You showed him this video of what the future can be like.
1011	Question	But do you have an idea specifically of the model that you would like to go towards?
1012	Question	Economically, is he open to more economic freedom?
1013	Donald Trump	Yeah, it's a good question.
1014	Donald Trump	So you saw a tape today, and that, I think, was done really well.
1015	Donald Trump	But that was done at the highest level of future development.
1016	Donald Trump	I told him, you may not want this.
1017	Donald Trump	You may want to do a much smaller version of this.
1018	Donald Trump	I mean, you're going to do something.
1019	Donald Trump	But you may want to do a smaller version.
1020	Donald Trump	You may not want that with the trains and the everything.
1021	Donald Trump	You know, it's super  everything the top.
1022	Donald Trump	And maybe you won't want that.
1023	Donald Trump	It's going to be up to them.
1024	Donald Trump	It's going to be up to them.
1025	Donald Trump	It's going to be up to the people what they want.
1026	Donald Trump	They may not want that.
1027	Donald Trump	I can understand that too.
1028	Donald Trump	But that was a version of what could happen, what could take place.
1029	Donald Trump	As an example, they have great beaches.
1030	Donald Trump	You see that whenever they're exploding their cannons into the ocean, right?
1031	Donald Trump	I said, "Boy, look at the view.
1032	Donald Trump	Wouldn't that make a great condo behind?"
1033	Donald Trump	And I explained, I said, "You know, instead of doing that, you could have the best hotels in the world right there."
1034	Donald Trump	Think of it from a real estate perspective.
1035	Donald Trump	You have South Korea, you have China, and they own the land in the middle.
1036	Donald Trump	How bad is that, right?
1037	Donald Trump	It's great.
1038	Donald Trump	But I told him, I said, you may not want to do what's there.
1039	Donald Trump	You may want to do a smaller version of it or  you know.
1040	Donald Trump	And that could be.
1041	Donald Trump	Although, I tell you what  he looked at that tape, he looked at that iPad, and I'm telling you they really enjoyed it, I believe.
1042	Donald Trump	Okay?
1043	Donald Trump	Yeah.
1044	Donald Trump	Go ahead.
1045	Donald Trump	A couple more.
1046	Donald Trump	Okay.
1047	Donald Trump	We'll do three more.
1048	Donald Trump	Yeah.
1049	Donald Trump	Go ahead.
1050	Donald Trump	Go.
1051	Question	Brian Bennett from Time Magazine.
1052	Donald Trump	Yes.
1053	Donald Trump	Hi, Brian.
1054	Donald Trump	Am I on the cover again this week?
1055	Donald Trump	Boy, have I  so many covers.
1056	Question	It's entirely possible.
1057	Donald Trump	Huh?
1058	Donald Trump	I know.
1059	Donald Trump	That's okay.
1060	Question	Do you now see Kim Jong Un as an equal?
1061	Donald Trump	In what way?
1062	Question	You just showed a video that showed you and Kim Jong Un on equal footing in discussing the future of 
1063	Donald Trump	No.
1064	Donald Trump	I think that  I don't view it that way.
1065	Donald Trump	See, I don't view it that way.
1066	Donald Trump	I'll do whatever it takes to make the world a safer place.
1067	Donald Trump	If I have to say I'm sitting on a stage  I mean, I understand what you're getting at.
1068	Donald Trump	If I have to say I'm sitting on a stage with Chairman Kim and that's going to get us to save 30 million lives  could be more than that  I'm willing to sit on the stage.
1069	Donald Trump	I'm willing to travel to Singapore very proudly, very gladly.
1070	Donald Trump	Again, I  you know, other than the fact that it is taking my time, they have given up a tremendous amount.
1071	Donald Trump	They've given it up even before.
1072	Donald Trump	And even add the Olympics to it.
1073	Donald Trump	You know, you could add the Olympics to the question.
1074	Donald Trump	They went to the Olympics.
1075	Donald Trump	They took an Olympics that was going to be a massive failure that maybe wouldn't have even opened, and they made it a tremendous success by agreeing to participate.
1076	Donald Trump	Add that to the list of things that they've done.
1077	Donald Trump	So, Brian, if I can save millions of lives by coming here, sitting down, and establishing a relationship with someone who's a very powerful man, who's got firm control of a country, and that country has very powerful nuclear weapons, it's my honor to do it.
1078	Question	Are you concerned that the video you just showed could be used by Kim as propaganda to show him as an equal 
1079	Donald Trump	No, I'm not concerned at all.
1080	Donald Trump	We can use that video for other countries.
1081	Donald Trump	Go ahead.
1082	Question	Mr. President, in the year 2000, President Clinton got a request by Kim Jong Il.
1083	Donald Trump	Got impressed?
1084	Question	Got a request 
1085	Donald Trump	Oh.
1086	Question	From Kim Jong Il to travel to Pyongyang and meet him.
1087	Question	And Clinton refused.
1088	Question	He sent Secretary of State Albright.
1089	Donald Trump	Yeah.
1090	Donald Trump	He did a great deal.
1091	Donald Trump	And he spent $3 billion and got nothing.
1092	Donald Trump	And he started making nuclear weapons a day later.
1093	Question	Mr. President, you, on the other hand, got the request and right away went here to meet him.
1094	Question	And do you understand those people who say that you gave him the ultimate present  the legitimacy to a regime who oppress its people without an ongoing process before you, as the U.S. President, as the leader of the free world, meet and shake hands with this leader of North Korea who is perceived to be oppressing brutally his own people?
1095	Donald Trump	Okay.
1096	Donald Trump	Good.
1097	Donald Trump	I think we just answered the question.
1098	Question	But do you understand those people?
1099	Donald Trump	Oh, I understand them much better than you do.
1100	Donald Trump	Okay.
1101	Donald Trump	Yeah.
1102	Donald Trump	Go ahead.
1103	Donald Trump	Go ahead.
1104	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.

1108	Donald Trump	Hi.
1109	Question	Hi.
1110	Question	You mentioned a couple specific concessions that you got from Kim the return of remains and the destruction of the nuclear site.
1111	Question	And I know you said that was an addon 
1112	Donald Trump	And much more.
1113	Donald Trump	And much more than that.
1114	Question	Yeah.
1115	Question	I know you said the last thing was an addon and it wasn't in the agreement, but that he gave you his word.
1116	Question	If he doesn't follow through on these things, what are you prepared to do in response?
1117	Question	And will you lose faith in this process?
1118	Donald Trump	No.
1119	Donald Trump	I think he'll do it.
1120	Donald Trump	I really believe that.
1121	Donald Trump	Otherwise, I wouldn't be doing this.
1122	Donald Trump	I really believe it.
1123	Donald Trump	And it was really the engine testing site, in addition to all of the other things that they've agreed to do.
1124	Donald Trump	It was the  they have a very powerful engine testing site that, again, we're able to see because of the heat that it emits.
1125	Donald Trump	And, yeah, I'm able to  I'm very happy.
1126	Donald Trump	I'll tell you what  I'm very happy with those two points  the two points you mentioned.
1127	Donald Trump	But I think you might be referring to the thing that's not in, which is the engine testing site.
1128	Donald Trump	I think he's  I think  honestly, I think he's going to do these things.
1129	Donald Trump	I may be wrong.
1130	Donald Trump	I mean, I may stand before you in six months and say, "Hey, I was wrong."
1131	Donald Trump	I don't know that I'll ever admit that, but I'll find some kind of an excuse.
1132	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
1133	Donald Trump	Okay, one or two.

1144	Donald Trump	Yes.
1145	Donald Trump	I will.
1146	Question	And what's your expectation about China's role to accelerate the process to establish a longterm peace mechanism?
1147	Donald Trump	Well, my expectation about China is that China is a great country with a great leader, and a friend of mine.

1154	Donald Trump	And we have set records economically  over $7 trillion in net worth addition to what we have.
1155	Donald Trump	And we are almost twice the size, the economy of the United States.
1156	Donald Trump	Nobody talks about this, because you do hear a lot about China, rightfully so.
1157	Donald Trump	But the United States, now, is almost twice the size of the economy of China.
1158	Donald Trump	We have a great country and we're on a correct path.
1159	Donald Trump	Okay.
1160	Donald Trump	One more.
1161	Donald Trump	That will be it.
1162	Question	Mr. President, from South Korea.
1163	Donald Trump	Oh, South Korea?
1164	Donald Trump	Where's South Korea?
1165	Donald Trump	I think you deserve  go ahead.
1166	Donald Trump	Go.
1167	Donald Trump	You deserve one.
1168	Donald Trump	Yes.
1169	Donald Trump	You deserve one.
1170	Question	I've got two questions for you, Mr. President.

1172	Donald Trump	Yes.
1173	Question	What do you plan to discuss with him?
1174	Donald Trump	I just want to tell him about the meeting.
1175	Donald Trump	Very successful.
1176	Donald Trump	And he'll be very much involved in the final negotiation.
1177	Donald Trump	He's a very, very fine gentleman.
1178	Donald Trump	Also a friend of mine.
1179	Donald Trump	And I look forward to speaking.
1180	Donald Trump	He'll be very happy when he hears about  I've already sent word to him about what happened.
1181	Donald Trump	I sent the document to him, actually, and all of the details behind the document.
1182	Donald Trump	So I'll be talking to him very shortly.
1183	Question	If I may ask another question.
1184	Question	In signing the peace treaty, do you hope to  do you plan to work this out with North Korea's Chairman Kim only, or what do you think about the involvement of South Korea and China as the signatories?
1185	Donald Trump	I'd like to have them involved also.
1186	Donald Trump	There's a question as to whether or not we're supposed to or whether or not we legally have to.
1187	Donald Trump	I don't care.
1188	Donald Trump	I think it would be great to have China involved and also, of course, South Korea.
1189	Donald Trump	Okay? Is there a transcript of
1190	SYSTEM	[inaudible]
1191	Donald Trump	?
1192	Donald Trump	What? Is there a transcript of

1197	Question	So that was recorded?
1198	Donald Trump	No, they didn't record it.
1199	Donald Trump	I don't think they recorded it.
1200	Donald Trump	Are there any recordings of it?
1201	Donald Trump	I wish there were.
1202	Donald Trump	Because it is interesting stuff.
1203	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]

1205	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]

1210	Donald Trump	It was a very heartfelt conversation. How do you believe
1211	SYSTEM	[inaudible]

1219	Question	.
1220	Donald Trump	Yeah, but I don't want to discuss it.
1221	Donald Trump	But we did is we've had numerous discussions.
1222	Donald Trump	We've had very important relationships established at Mike's level and other levels.
1223	Donald Trump	In fact, a couple of people are here from, as you know, from North Korea.
1224	Donald Trump	They're in the room.
1225	Donald Trump	We have a few people in the back also, in the room.
1226	Donald Trump	So when we went into this final agreement, very importantly, we really didn't go in cold.
1227	Donald Trump	We went in with tremendous relationship and tremendous knowledge.
1228	Donald Trump	And I think that's why we got it done.
1229	Donald Trump	So I'm going to head back.
1230	Donald Trump	I don't know about you folks, but it's been a long time since I've taken it easy.
1231	Donald Trump	So now we can take it a little bit easy, and then the work begins again.
1232	Donald Trump	And I appreciate everybody being here.
