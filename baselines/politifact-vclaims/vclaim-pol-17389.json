The headline of a recent blog post exploits those fears.\u00a0\n\"Colorado school forces students to wear hijabs,\" reads the headline of the Jan. 30 post, which was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nBut students were not mandated to \"wear hijabs\" in the classroom. Even the blog post goes on to say that the Douglas County School District in the Centennial State \"informed parents that students would be attending a field trip to the Colorado Muslim Society\u2019s Majif Abu Bakar as well as a synagogue and Greek Orthodox cathedral.\"\nStudents were instructed to wear \"appropriate long pants,\" the story says, while female students were also told they \"must bring scarves or hooded sweatshirts for the mosque.\"\nHere\u2019s what you need to know.\u00a0\nFirst, though the blog post being shared on Facebook is from 2020, this story originates in January 2015.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto shows Rep.

Ankles must be covered. Girls must bring wide scarves or hooded sweatshirts for the mosque.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nThe blog post correctly reported that but its headline gives a different impression, leading readers to believe that a Colorado school district was requiring all female students to wear a Muslim veil. (As this New York Times story explains, \"hijab\" is not described as an article of clothing in the Koran, but as something like a curtain or \"separation\" that provides privacy.)\nWhat really happened: a Colorado middle school asked female students attending a voluntary field trip to wear cover their heads with a scarf or sweatshirt to abide by the dress code of the mosque they would visit.\u00a0\nWe rate this headline False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17389"}
