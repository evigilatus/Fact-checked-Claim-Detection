Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., who has made comments supporting violence against Democrats and promoted\u00a0the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory.\nThe FBI has called the QAnon movement a domestic terrorism threat, and its adherents were among those who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, driving McCarthy and other lawmakers out of their chambers as they counted electoral votes.\nBut in a press briefing Feb. 3, McCarthy professed ignorance about QAnon, and mispronounced its name.\u00a0\nDefending Greene, he said: \"I think it would be helpful if you could hear exactly what she told all of us \u2014 denouncing \u2018Q-on.\u2019 I don\u2019t know if I say it right. I don\u2019t even know what it is.\"\npic.twitter.com/J2XfuRYVG7\u2014 Acyn Torabi (@Acyn) February 4, 2021 \nQAnon\u2019s involvement in the Capitol riot drove a surge in awareness of the movement, whose followers believe former President Donald Trump was on a secret mission to fight a cabal of Satan-worshipping, cannibalistic pedophiles that includes top-ranking Democrats and Hollywood celebrities.\u00a0\nSo can McCarthy fairly claim, less than a month after the riot, that he doesn\u2019t know what QAnon is \u2014 or even how to say its name?\u00a0\nNo, he can\u2019t.\u00a0\nMcCarthy has spoken about QAnon publicly at least three times, and appeared to know enough about it to speak out against it. He\u2019s also pronounced the name correctly before.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin Nunes\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in an interview on Fox\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRepublicans have no way to communicate\u201d after tech companies cut off Parler.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Amy Sherman \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an Aug. 21 press briefing, McCarthy got a question about Greene, who had just won her primary in Georgia. In his answer, he explicitly denounced QAnon, which he called \"the Q organization.\"\u00a0\n\"She recently came out and denounced the Q organization, whatever beliefs, I do not agree with their beliefs at all,\" he said. At the time, Greene hadn\u2019t denounced QAnon, although she had told Fox News that she had since chosen \"another path.\"\u00a0\nIn an interview with Fox News that same day, McCarthy denounced QAnon a second time and pronounced it correctly. \"Let me be very clear: There is no place for QAnon in the Republican Party. I do not support it,\" he said.\nDuring a November news conference, a reporter asked McCarthy if he was concerned about new members of Congress like Greene and Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., who have expressed support for QAnon.\u00a0\n\n\"Our party is very diverse. You mentioned two people who are going to join our party, and both of them have denounced Q-on,\" he replied, mispronouncing it again.\nThis was also misleading. While Boebert had attempted to distance herself from the conspiracy theory, Greene still had not.\u00a0\nA McCarthy spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nMcCarthy said, \"I don\u2019t even know what (QAnon) is.\"\nMcCarthy has spoken about QAnon in at least three public appearances.
