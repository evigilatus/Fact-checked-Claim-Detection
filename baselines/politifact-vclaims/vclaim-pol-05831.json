On the image, two columns were circled in red -- two columns of sub-results by age group for a question about how favorably or unfavorably the respondent views Hillary Clinton.\nThe two columns show responses for survey participants ages 18 to 34 and ages 35 to 49. Every possible answer in those columns has been marked N/A -- \"not applicable.\"\nThe creator of the image was dumbfounded, slapping this comment on the image in big red type: \"CNN's Crap Polling: No one under the age of 50 has an opinion of Hillary Clinton?\"\nThe reader who contacted PolitiFact wondered whether the image creator\u2019s question was legitimate, so we took a closer look.\nBottom line: It\u2019s all a misunderstanding about how CNN reports the results of its surveys. (After we emailed questions to the person who had posted it on their Facebook page, we didn\u2019t receive a response, but the post was pulled down. We saved a screenshot, above.)\nThe easiest way to debunk the graphic\u2019s assumption is to look a few columns to the right. There, one can find a heading that reads \"under 50,\" with 74 percent of respondents in that age group saying they feel favorably about Clinton, 23 percent saying they feel unfavorably, 3 percent saying they have no opinion and 1 percent saying they\u2019ve never heard of her. (Our real question: Who belongs to the 1 percent who have never heard of Hillary Clinton?)\nSo this column of poll results clearly shows that people under 50 did tell the survey takers about their opinions about Clinton.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat about those mysterious columns full of \"N/A\"?\nThey are there because of CNN\u2019s polling policy. The policy is explained fully in the same document that the Facebook image was drawn from, though it appears on an earlier page not shown in the Facebook post. This section explains the CNN policy on \"crosstabs\" -- the polling industry\u2019s term for results sorted by demographic subcategories such as age, race, gender or income level.\n\"Crosstabs on the following pages only include results for subgroups with enough unweighted cases to produce a sampling error of +/- 8.5 percentage points or less,\" CNN wrote. \"Some subgroups represent too small a share of the national population to produce crosstabs with an acceptable sampling error. Interviews were conducted among these subgroups, but results for groups with a sampling error larger than +/-8.5 percentage points are not displayed and instead are denoted with \u2018N/A.\u2019 \"\nIn other words, for the age ranges 18 to 34 and 35 to 49, the survey reached too few people to produce a statistically valid sample -- so to avoid publishing questionable numbers, CNN simply reported them as \"N/A.\"\nThis pattern -- categories with larger sample sizes given specific figures, and those with smaller sample size\u00a0marked \"N/A\" -- is echoed elsewhere in the full document.\n\"The CNN/ORC polls are highly regarded,\" said Karlyn Bowman, a polling analyst at the American Enterprise Institute. \"They are one of the few partnerships to provide us subgroup data, which is invaluable. The Facebook question does a disservice to the poll.\"\nOur ruling\nThe Internet graphic accused CNN of being such an incompetent pollster that it found that \"no one under the age of 50 has an opinion of Hillary Clinton.\"\nThis is based on a misreading of the CNN-sponsored poll. Two age-range subcategories produced too few respondents to qualify as statistically valid results under CNN\u2019s threshold, which was plainly spelled out in the survey-results document. The claim is even debunked on the graphic itself -- it showed a category with actual results for respondents under the age of 50. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05831"}
