Castin, a former clean-energy businessman, who turned on the outskirts of Illinois State in the sixth district of Congress for Democrats in 2018, is not the first political opponent on Earth to face a difficult deadline on climate change. :: Prominent Democrats, including presidential candidate Peto Aurourke, and the United States Republic of America, Alexandria Okasio-Courtis, made similar allegations earlier this year that were in fact contradicted by scientists by Associated Press and CNN. Castin &apos; s claim and other similar claims are the result of a report issued in 2018 by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. That report stated that States must take \"unprecedented\" actions to reduce emissions, which would have to be on a significantly different track by 2030 in order to avoid the more severe effects of increased warming. However, it did not specify the difficult deadline proposed by Castin and others. This is partly due to the fact that the serious effects of climate change have already begun. According to experts, if warming continues at its current rate, global temperatures are likely to reach 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees F) above pre-industrial levels between 2030 and 2052. If temperatures exceed 1.5 degrees, the report warned, the planet would face larger disturbances, some of which \"may be long-term or irreversible.\" In order to prevent temperatures from rising above that temperature, the report stated with high confidence that CO2 emissions should start to decline \"before 2030\" and be about half below by 2030. Following the release of the report last October, a popular story began to emerge that only 12 years remained to work to avoid the most severe consequences of climate change. But experts say that the conclusion is too much for the findings of the report, which relied on the work of hundreds of scientists. James Sekka, co-chair of the report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and Professor of Sustainable Energy at Imperial London College, told Associated Press in March that the Panel \"did not say that we have 12 years left to save the world.\" We followed up with Skya, who confirmed that the team hasn't published any work since, supporting the difficult deadline suggested by Castine. In response to our query, a spokesperson for the Castin campaign sent us several sources, two of which focused on the IPCC report. One of them, a recent article by InterClimate News, explained the IPCC emission reduction schedule that did not mean that 2030 was the threshold for climate disasters. It was published on January 25, 2021 in a video that says Bill Gates \"at least 3 billion people must die\" from this planet. \u2022 On January 27, 2021, the deadline was \"more than a message tool than a physical scientific fact,\" said Daniel Swin, Climatic scientist at the University of California, the National Center for Atmospheric Research and the National Centre for Climate and Extreme Weather, which was quoted in the article. \"The next decade is indeed a critical window for achieving sufficient technological, economic and policy momentum towards a carbon-neutral world while minimizing societal unrest,\" he told us. \"But on the other hand, there is no geophysical shelf at the end of the decade that will make all our efforts controversial if we do not make them all the way.\" The climate researcher at Duke Drew Schindel University, a key author of the chapter on mitigation of climate change from the IPCC report, told us that the Panel has already found that \"If we are not on a much different path by 2030 from our current course, we cannot keep it within the 1.5\u00b0C warming target.\" \"But we won't necessarily face the \"worst scenario\" if we don't act in less than a decade as it does during 2030 is better than waiting until we say 2040s, so there's always a worse situation,\" he said. Shendell and others also pointed out that the serious effects of global warming, including sea-level rise and drought, are challenges we are already facing today and will continue to grow regardless. Our referee Castine said that \"most climate scientists agree that we have less than a decade to turn things around, otherwise we will be stuck with the \"worst-case scenario,\" including rising sea levels, devastating drought, and worsening famines. The United Nations Climate Report 2018 identified a significant reduction in carbon emissions by 2030, which is necessary to keep global temperatures from rising 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels in the coming years and to mitigate the effects of the warming planet. Experts have told us that actions taken to reduce emissions in the next decade will be crucial. However, they said that it was too simple to suggest that we face a difficult deadline of a decade to address climate change before we cross a threshold into a climate disaster. We assess Castin's claim mostly true. It is almost true that the statement is accurate but requires further clarification or information.
