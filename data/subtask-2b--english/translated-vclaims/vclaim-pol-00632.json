On May 9, Trump said: \"We will always protect patients who have pre-existing conditions, very important.\" It is only natural that Trump wishes to make this allegation. The vote from the Kaiser Family Foundation indicates that this protection, which prevents individual insurance schemes from charging people more on the basis of their medical history, is a top priority for Americans and one of the most common provisions of the Affordable Care Act. (KHN is a editorially independent programme of the Foundation.) In this context, we have decided to place a microscope for the President &apos; s claim. We asked White House staff to refer to the policies or proposals on which the Trump Statement was based. They refused to provide details, but reiterated the President &apos; s assertion. However, Texas v. Azar, interviewing a health policy vacuum with four separate experts, indicated that the Administration &apos; s position on a pending case seeking to repeal the Affordable Care Act was inconsistent with Tramp &apos; s claim. The case, known as Texas v. Azar, comes from a group of Republican public defenders who claim that the health law as a whole should be repealed because the 2017 Tax Bill eliminated the Obama Kerr Insurance Clause, which is often called individual jurisdiction. In December, a judge in Texas approved. The case is now before the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal. More importantly, the Ministry of Justice - the legal arm of the Trump administration - has refused to defend the anti-corruption body in these proceedings. It is very unusual for the administration to refuse to defend a federal law in court. \"This is a case where the Section can present strong arguments for the defence of the Statute. The refusal of defence in these circumstances is almost unprecedented.\" Nicholas Bagley, Professor of Law at the University of Michigan, said. At the outset, the Tramp Administration &apos; s position on the case focused on individual jurisdiction, arguing that without it the protection that had previously existed under the Anti-Corruption Act should also be abolished. However, by submitting a note to the Court of Appeal, the Ministry of Justice joined the plaintiffs to demand the total repeal of the law. This result would also eliminate the protection provided by law to persons with pre-existing health conditions. In this context, \"There's a real reason to doubt\" about Trump's assertion, said Wendy Nitter Epstein, Professor of Law at DePaul University. On January 14, 2021, Chuck Grasley stated in a tweet that insulin prices had \"lost the RoOOF for patients/taxpayers bc from the manufacturer, a health plan and PBM Biz practices.\" By Madison Black: February 2, 2012, the most generous evaluation came from Jonathan Adler, an expert in health law at Case Western Reserve University. Adler supported Obamaker's previous challenges, but argued that this was not legally correct. He agreed that the White House's actual actions were \"in contradiction with the President's promise.\" However, Adler said that the structure of Tramp's claim - which promised what his administration would do, rather than comment on what it had done - left open the possibility of taking further steps to preserve the protection of pre-existing conditions. It is true that other experts have admitted it. To date, the White House has postponed a legislative push beyond the 2020 elections - leaving a vacuum if the health law is passed by the courts. Several experts said that the draft laws submitted so far by the White House - including the so-called Graham-Cassidy legislation - had been proposed for the first time in 2017, which the Administration had once again endorsed in the proposed budget for 2019. In contrast to the Comprehensive Health Insurance Act, Graham-Cassidy allows states to redefine basic benefits - a list that includes the protection of persons with health problems - which must include insurance schemes, making such protection optional. (For more information on Graham Cassidy, here's another polyte fact from last fall.) In addition, experts said, even if the White House had a plan, that it had little chance of getting through with the divided Congress. This makes ACA's protection in court \"the only offer in the city\" if the administration is serious about protecting consumers who have pre-existing circumstances, Bagley said. There is one gap on which conservatives may rely, including the White House, as suggested by Sabrina Corlett, a professor at the Institute of Health Policy at Georgetown University. It depends on what people mean when they talk about protection. Some experts also indicate that the Administration has issued regulations that are inconsistent with Tramp &apos; s claim. In particular, it recently issued a rule that eases restrictions on the length of so-called short-term health plans, which the proponents said would provide a more expensive option for the individual insurance market. However, these plans, which, because of a change of base, can last one year instead of three months, are considered naked bones and are not required to protect against pre-existing circumstances. Our referee Trump said that his administration would protect patients before. The White House policy path is doing the exact opposite. The position of the Ministry of Justice, which reflects a policy that exists at the same time as the President made this allegation, would repeal the only law guaranteeing access to health coverage for persons in pre-existing situations and not having to pay any more. On the regulatory front, the Department has put forward a health insurance option that is not required to include this protection. Furthermore, the Administration had not developed any plan that could maintain those safeguards. Each alternative health bill approved has provided less generous protection than the anti-corruption law. Further steps have been taken that can make it difficult for people with pre-existing conditions to obtain affordable coverage. This statement is not accurate, and he claims to be directly opposed to what is actually happening. We assess it wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00632"}
