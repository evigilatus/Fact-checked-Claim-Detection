Who\u2019s going to be the game\u2019s most valuable player? Let\u2019s hypothesize!\nNFL Hall of Fame running back Marshall Faulk says the MVP pick is \"already etched in stone.\"\nObviously, it\u2019s going to be Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning, he said during a face-off with Michael Irvin on the NFL Network. Faulk laid out pretty compelling evidence to make his case.\n\"Quarterbacks, they have won the MVP more than 50 percent of the time,\" he said.\nSomeone on Twitter heard Faulk\u2019s claim and asked us if it is correct.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTurns out Faulk is right.\nOf the 47 Super Bowls, 26 quarterbacks have walked away with MVP honors, way more than any other position, according to an ESPN tally.\nVictors include multiple winners such as Green Bay\u2019s Bart Starr, Pittsburgh\u2019s Terry Bradshaw, and San Francisco\u2019s Joe Montana, as well as recent repeat winners in New England\u2019s Tom Brady and the New York Giants\u2019 Eli Manning.\nPeyton Manning could join the two-time MVP club Sunday night. He won the award for Super Bowl XLI in 2007 after passing for 247 yards and a touchdown against the Chicago Bears.\nFor his MVP pick, Irvin chose Broncos wide receiver Wes Welker. Wide receivers and running backs are the next most likely positions for MVP, but they far and away trail the quarterbacks. (It\u2019s a lot tougher for defense. The last defensive player to win the award was Tampa Bay Buccaneers safety Dexter Jackson in 2003.)\nWe rate Faulk\u2019s claim True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08321"}
