This is what they left behind in this process: the fact that Trump was not speaking clearly about asylum-seekers. His comment \"The living\" came almost a year ago during the White House debate about members of the MS-13 gang. It began on April 5, when Twitter @markbolity, owned by a man named Mark Elliot, tweeted a 47-second video from Trump, where he talks about people coming to the United States and says the word \"animals.\" The tweet that has since been removed from the video said: \"[e-mail] is protected against persons seeking asylum: these are not persons. These are animals.\" @markbulity (tweeted image sent on April 5, 2019 by) Sen Kristin Gillibrand of New York, who will run for President in the 2020 elections, shared the video on Twitter the following day, adding: \"A racist language such as this has led to violence throughout the history of the world. No human being is an animal. We should be better than this.\" Such racist language has led to violence throughout the history of the world. No human being is an animal. We must be better than this. https://t.co/TQ0MhJFGtq - Kristen Gilibrand (@SenGilibrand) 6 April 2019 south of pend, Ind., Mayor of Beit Butigigig, who also tendered for the White House, did not post the video on his Twitter account; but on April 6 she tweeted, \"You do not refer to humans as animals. You just don't.\" Tom Peres, President of the National Democratic Commission, Democratic legislators, maturers and activists, also shared the tweeting of the video as an example for asylum-seekers who deny Trump their humanity. Now, Trump &apos; s recent comments on asylum-seekers have been harsh. He said, \"The asylum program is a trick,\" and the new management attitude is, \"The system is full, it can't take you anymore.\" Most people who reach the border are unaccompanied families and children, but Trump claims that some asylum seekers are \"some of the toughest people you've ever seen in your life,\" However, the Democrats ignored the important context in their attacks on this Trump video last year. Trump made the observation of \"animals\" in May 2018 during a round table discussion on so-called cities of refuge, MS-13 gang members and other policies throughout the country regarding the detention of migrants. Members of the Cabinet, California Police Chiefs and other elected officials attended the meeting. The Trump comment was in response to the Mayor of Fresno Margaret Meems County, who was telling the President how federal and California laws affected her function. Here comes the main part of the exchange, with Trump quoted in the bold line of emphasis: Mems: \"Here we are stuck in the middle, trying to decide. We have federal law, we have state law. And that's why I welcomed the Attorney General's claim because it would provide us with the clarity we need and the guidance we need. What do we do? Because we're here. On February 1, 2021, Tom Cotton mentioned in an interview with Fox and friends \"Many of these arriving immigrants, we have no way of checking their background for either health or security.\" By Miriam Valverdi, 3 February 2021 \"and I appreciate Mr. Homan and IC. We had a wonderful relationship, and we still do. But now ICE is the only law enforcement agency that can't use our databases to find the bad guys. They can't go in and talk to people in our prison, unless they reach a certain threshold. They can't do all the things that other law enforcement agencies can do. And he's really putting us in a really bad position.\" Trump: \"It's a shame. Okay? It's a shame.\" Mems: \"It's a shame.\" Trump: \"We're suing for it, we're working hard, and I think it'll all come together, because people want it to get together. This is so ridiculous. The idea we're talking about is ridiculous. We'll take care of it, Margaret. We're gonna win.\" Mems: \"Thank you. There may be a MS-13 gang member I know about -- if they don't reach a certain threshold, I can't tell ICE about it.\" Trump: \"We have people coming into the country, or trying to get in - and we're stopping a lot of them - but we're getting people out of the country. You're not gonna believe how bad these people are. These aren't humans. These are animals. We're taking them out of the country at a level that's never happened before. Because of weak laws, they come quickly, we get them, we release them, we get them back, we get them out. This is crazy. \"The dumbest laws, as I said before, are the dumbest laws on migration in the world. So we'll take care of it, Margaret. We'll finish it.\" The video video of @markbolity (which received more than 14,000 retwets and 23,000 loved before it was dropped) did not include the previous comment by the sheriff about MS-13 gang members, making it seem like Trump was generally referring to immigrants. Since Tramp didn't specifically mention MS-13 in the same breath, some Democrats then interpreted it as saying that all immigrants were animals. This led to a fight between Tramp and Nancy Pelosi, now speaking at the United States House, where Trump Zora said that she had gone out \"to support MS-13\" when he condemned his comments. Paulette Fuckett contacted @markbulity on Twitter on April 8, saying that we were checking the truth about his tweeting and asking him for contact information so that we could send a query. The biography section of his Twitter page does not specify his profession or any other contact information (links to The New York Times). We separately sent a detailed e-mail and voice mail to Mark Elliott, who appears to be the person behind @markwellity. We didn't hear a reply. Less than an hour after our voicemail and e-mail indicating the context of Trump's comment, @markworthy deleted April 5, and published a new explanatory tweet. \"I have learned that Trump's comments were in response to a specific question about MS-13 members and not about asylum-seekers on a wider scale. I've chosen to delete the tweet, but I copy it here. My apologies for the inaccuracy, \"she tweeted Markwlippity. I have learned that Trump &apos; s comments were in response to a specific question about MS-13 members and not about asylum-seekers on a wider scale.

Pic.twitter.com/ODTDNvzSdq - Mark Elliott (@markwiltity) 8 April 2019 Our article on viral Twitter said Tramp is an asylum seeker \"not people. These are animals.\" The tweet has left an important context. Trump refers to some people as \"animals,\" but it was during an exchange about MS-13 gang members. His comment was not direct with regard to asylum-seekers. We evaluate the tweet is false.
