For this item, we're checking the claim about Julia at age 25.\n\n\"Under President Obama: After graduation, Julia's federal student loans are more manageable since President Obama capped income-based federal student loan payments and kept interest rates low. She makes her payments on time every month, keeping her on track to repay her student loans.\"\n\n\"Under Mitt Romney: Under the Romney/Ryan budget, interest rates on federal student loans would be allowed to double, affecting Julia and 7.4 million other students.\"\n\nThat surprised us because we recalled Romney and House Republican leaders saying recently that they did not want the rates to double. So we looked into the claim.\n\nWhat\u2019s at stake\n\nFirst, some background on the student loan issue.\n\nAs\u00a0PolitiFact Ohio noted recently, the College Cost Reduction and Access Act (H.R. 2669) was passed by Congress in 2007. The law gradually reduced the interest rate on federally subsidized loans to undergraduate student borrowers from 6.8 percent in July 2006 to 3.4 percent in July 2011.\n\nAdvanced by a newly Democratic-majority Congress, the law had bipartisan support. Democrats were joined by 77 House Republicans and 35 Senate Republicans. The bill was signed by President George W. Bush.\n\nThe law expires in July and if no action is taken, the interest rate will return to 6.8 percent. That would affect more than 7 million borrowers, and add $1,000 a year to the repayment cost of the average loan, according to Education Secretary Arne Duncan.\n\nObama's budget proposal for fiscal 2013 included money to extend the lower rate, though only for one year. Romney, Ryan and House Republican leaders would also keep it at 3.4 percent, although they want to pay for it by repealing a portion of the Democratic health care law.\n\nRomney\u2019s position on the loan issue\n\nDuring a campaign of sharp disagreements, the student loan rate is a rare example of unity between Obama and Romney.\n\nAt an April 23, 2012, campaign appearance near Philadelphia, Romney said, \"I support extending the temporary relief on interest rates for students\" given the \"extraordinarily poor conditions in the job market.\"\n\nThe\u00a0Associated Press\u00a0reported that Romney did not offer specifics on how the extension should be paid for or how long it should last, and as we will explain below, resolving these differences will not be easy.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, the comments indicate that Julia's rates wouldn't rise under Romney as the cartoon suggests.\n\nRomney\u2019s position on the Ryan budget\n\nBut note that Obama campaign attempts to link Romney to the budget produced by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis. Democrats have made the Ryan budget a centerpiece of their attacks since it would likely lead to deep cuts in federal spending, including reductions in popular programs.\n\nThe Obama campaign pointed us to two pieces of evidence to link Romney to Ryan\u2019s budget.\n\nFirst,\u00a0Romney said at a March campaign event in Chicago, \"I'm very supportive of the Ryan budget plan. It's a bold and exciting effort on his part and on the part of the Republicans, and it's very much consistent with what I put out earlier. ... I applaud it. It's an excellent piece of work and very much needed.\"\n\nSecond, the Obama campaign quotes Ryan saying on the\u00a0March 25, 2012, edition of CBS\u2019 Face the Nation\u00a0that he expects Romney to implement his budget proposal if he wins the presidency. When CBS\u2019 Norah O\u2019Donnell asked Ryan, \"If Mitt Romney became president of the United States, you`re convinced he would follow through with a lot of the reductions that you make in this plan?\" Ryan twice said \"yes.\"\n\nBut these statements are hardly a slam-dunk that Romney has embraced the entire Ryan budget -- nor that it will be enacted. While Romney praised the proposal, he stopped short of promising to enact it.\n\nThen there\u2019s the question of what the Ryan budget would actually do regarding student loans.\n\nWhat Ryan would do\n\nThe Ryan budget is a blueprint, with significant discretion left for future congressional actions on the specifics about revenues and spending. Nowhere in the budget does it say, \"Allow the rates on student loans to double.\" The budget could result in a doubling of rates (or perhaps a smaller increase) if that\u2019s what Congress chooses to do in the future. However, Congress could choose to protect the lower interest rates and cut elsewhere instead.\n\n\"Democrats are claiming that the House-passed budget doubled the rate because it did not directly address the question of how to extend it,\" said Conor Sweeney, a spokesman for the House Budget Committee, which Ryan chairs. \"This is not how a budget works. The budget sets overall targets and gives committees of jurisdiction broad latitude in meeting those targets.\"\n\nAs it happens, the brouhaha on the campaign trail over student loans prompted Republican leaders on April 27 to vote on a bill to stop the rate from doubling. The bill would continue the 3.4 percent rate and pay for it by repealing a provision of Obama\u2019s health care law known as the Prevention and Public Health Fund. The bill\u00a0passed\u00a0by a 215-195 vote. The coalition in support was predominantly but not exclusively Republican; 13 Democrats voted for the GOP leadership-backed bill while 30 Republicans defected and voted against it.\n\nSo both parties want to keep the rate the same. The sticking point is how to pay for it. Many Democrats, including the White House, are strongly opposed to repealing the health fund,\u00a0which supports immunization, research, screenings and wellness education. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, has labeled the money a \"slush fund,\" a characterization Republicans have long used for the program. PolitiFact rated the term as a\u00a0Pants on Fire\u00a0falsehood a year ago.\n\nSweeney, the Ryan spokesman, said the bill that passed the House \"is fully compatible with our budget\u2019s targets.\" And Ryan himself voted for it.\n\nThe parties are so polarized that it's not clear how they might compromise on the issue. Still, a majority of the House, including a large majority of Republicans, did go on record to support a bill that would keep the interest rate from doubling.\n\nOur ruling\n\nThe Obama campaign claims that loan rates would double on Julia under Romney and the Ryan budget. But the evidence suggests otherwise.\n\nRomney opposes allowing the rates to double, and House Republicans -- including Ryan -- have voted to stop it from happening. Their approach to pay for the extension may not suit the White House, but it's inaccurate to say the rates would double. We rate the claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11160"}
