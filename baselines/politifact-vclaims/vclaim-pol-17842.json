However, there is a chance a positive result means that you have antibodies from an infection with a virus from the same family of viruses (called coronaviruses), such as the one that causes the common cold.\"\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

A sample could be taken using a swab to swipe inside your nose.\nAn antibody test is meant to tell you if you had a past infection by testing a sample of your blood for antibodies. The CDC notes that antibody tests \"should not be used to diagnose a current COVID-19 infection.\"\u00a0\nIf you test positive, you could have antibodies from the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19, or you could have antibodies from another coronavirus, like a cold. As Johns Hopkins Medicine notes, coronaviruses are a family of viruses and there are many different kinds of coronaviruses. Some cause disease and some don\u2019t.\u00a0\nA spokesperson for the CDC told AFP that the traces of other coronaviruses \u2014 like the common cold \u2014 won\u2019t produce a positive result from COVID-19 viral test.\nThis post, which is a screenshot of part of a CDC webpage about COVID-19 antibody tests, is cropped in a way that may suggest the warning pertains to the viral test.
