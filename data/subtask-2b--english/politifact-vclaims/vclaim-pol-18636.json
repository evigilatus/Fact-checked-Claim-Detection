Tony Evers has declared multiple states of emergency to implement a stay-at-home order and mask mandates. Republicans \u2014 who have a stranglehold on both Legislative houses \u2014 have challenged those in court, once successfully.\nBut they have chosen not to overturn Evers\u2019 orders themselves, despite having the authority to do so.\nOne viral Facebook post goes a step farther to say Republican legislators haven\u2019t done anything at all of late.\n\"Wisconsin Republicans have not passed a single bill in 6 months,\" says the Oct. 4, 2020, post, which is a screenshot of a tweet from the day before.\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook).\nThe post goes on to criticize Republicans for pushing back against Evers, saying they haven\u2019t \"done a single thing\" to slow the spread of COVID. (That\u2019s not accurate, as Republicans did pass a COVID-19 relief bill early in the pandemic.)\nBut let\u2019s focus in on the timeframe claim.\u00a0\nAmid a global pandemic that has fundamentally changed society throughout 2020, has the Legislature really not passed a single bill in half a year?\nThe last bill\nThe most recent law passed through the state Legislature came in April. The Assembly passed a COVID-19 response bill on April 14, and the Senate passed it a day later. The wide-ranging bill addressed unemployment, health care, education and government procedures in the wake of the pandemic, many provisions of which applied only during the first public health emergency that was declared by Evers in March.\nThat was more than five and a half months before this Facebook post. So the reference to six months is pretty much correct.\nThe Legislature has taken up no legislation since then. The only other action came Aug. 31, when legislative leaders held a pro-forma special session for a less than a minute without addressing\u00a0police use-of-force legislation that Evers urged them to take up.\nThe context\nBut let\u2019s take a little wider view before we rule on this claim.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Steineke\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembly Republicans \u201chave come to the table\u201d and were part of \u201cgive and take\u201d compromise on a coronavirus bill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Legislature is a cyclical body, and a lengthy period of inaction this time of year is actually normal. The Legislature typically adjourns in spring of an election year and doesn\u2019t come back until the new calendar year, and the 2020 calendar approved for this year back in January 2019 was no different.\nOf course, this year is anything but normal.\nSo a better gauge may be how other state Legislatures have responded to the coronavirus.\nAnd Wisconsin lawmakers have been among the least active in the country, according to a database of all COVID-related legislation across the country maintained by the National Conference of State Legislatures.\nThe bill passed in mid-April is the lone piece of coronavirus legislation adopted or enacted here, as nine other proposals failed. Only three states have done less, as North Dakota, Texas and Montana have passed no bills. Indiana has also passed one.\nNationally, 810 COVID bills have been adopted or enacted by state legislatures, led by 71 in Louisiana, 51 in California and 50 in New Jersey.\nIn many respects, it would be fair to hold Wisconsin to a higher standard of action, since it has a full-time Legislature. The national conference says Wisconsin is one of 10 states it considers full-time, meaning legislators work 80% or more of a full-time job, have large staffs and are paid enough to make a living without needing outside income.\nA Wispolitics.com analysis found Wisconsin has done far less than the other nine during the pandemic.\nThe Assembly and Senate have met just twice since the pandemic began \u2014 for each house to pass the April COVID bill. The other states have met an average of 38 times, with only Illinois (nine meetings) coming in at less than 20.\nIt\u2019s important to note, however, that seven of the nine other full-time legislatures are in states with an annual budget (as opposed to Wisconsin\u2019s biennial budget), meaning they need more floor sessions to pass that each year.\nKit Beyer, a spokeswoman for Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, noted that while the Legislature has not been in session, legislators have other work as well. In the past six months she said legislators have worked to help constituents with issues like getting unemployment benefits and have continued to meet in committees to prepare future legislation.\nOur ruling\nA viral Facebook post says, \"Wisconsin Republicans have not passed a single bill in 6 months,\" criticizing a lack of legislative action amid the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe timeframe is largely accurate. It\u2019s been more than five and a half months since the Legislature passed any bill.\nIt\u2019s not unusual in an election year for the Legislature to adjourn from spring until the new year. But the Wisconsin Legislature\u2019s inaction is unusual for this year, as lawmakers have done less than almost any other state to address the pandemic despite being one of just 10 full-time legislatures in the nation.\nThat makes this a reasonable statement.\nWe rate this claim True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18636"}
