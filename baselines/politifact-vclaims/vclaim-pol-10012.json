Jason Isaac said in a voters guide to the Nov. 6, 2012, election. \"We have a spending problem.\"\n\nThe Dripping Springs Republican, who went on to win his second term, said: \"Over the past 20 years, expenditures for education have increased 142% and Texas\u2019 per-pupil costs have increased from $3,659 to $11,024 after adjusting for inflation.\"\n\nHe was responding to this question in the guide produced by the Austin and Texas chapters of the League of Women Voters: \"Since 2006, state educational funding has been reduced and student enrollment has increased. What measures would you propose to restore adequate funding to Texas schools?\"\n\nSince the 2011 Legislature modified school finance formulas -- sending schools $4 billion less than if the formulas had stayed the same -- PolitiFact Texas has fielded a range of related claims. Recently, lawmakers have said Texas did not cut education spending (Pants on Fire), raised education spending (Pants on Fire) and raised education\u2019s share of the budget (Mostly True).\n\nBut none of those claims stretched back to the days of Guns \u2019N Roses.\n\nWe asked Isaac\u2019s campaign for the backup on his statement. Spokeswoman Ellen Troxclair replied with a June 2010 report from the right-leaning Texas Public Policy Foundation citing 1988-2008 total expenditures from the Texas Education Agency.\n\nSome perspective: Texas enrollment has grown substantially in recent decades. Agency data showed an increase of 47 percent in Isaac\u2019s chosen time span, from 3.2 million pupils to 4.7 million.\n\nLooking at the foundation report\u2019s data on expenditures, we first realized that Isaac\u2019s per-pupil statement had not been adjusted for inflation, in contrast to what he said in the guide. He gave a starting point of $3,659, which is the unadjusted amount for 1987-88. In 2008 dollars, it comes out to $6,659, confirmed by the foundation report and our math using the federal Consumer Price Index online calculator.\n\nWorking from 2008 dollars at both ends of the 20-year period yields a 66 percent increase, rather than the 201 percent increase Isaac\u2019s numbers indicated. That is, per-pupil spending increased at about one third the rate he suggested.\n\u00a0\nThe first part of Isaac\u2019s claim came straight from the report, Troxclair said. And it checks out, according to our math and the education agency\u2019s data. From 1987-88 through 2007-08, using 2008 dollars to adjust for inflation, Texas\u2019 total expenditures on education rose 142 percent.\n\nExperts suggested other flaws in Isaac\u2019s statement.\n\nFirst, operating expenditures would be a better measure than total expenditures, we heard in interviews with Texas Association of School Boards spokesman Dominic Giarratani and school funding expert Lori Taylor, an associate professor at Texas A&M University\u2019s Bush School of Government and Public Service.\n\nThat\u2019s because total expenditures fluctuate due to big-ticket construction projects that school districts mostly pay for on their own by issuing bonds. Operating expenditures more accurately reflect state budget dollars, they said.\n\nWe found that over the 20 years singled out by Isaac, inflation-adjusted operating expenditures more than doubled, rising 112 percent, or 42 percent per pupil.\n\nTroxclair acknowledged what she called the \"wording error\" on the per-pupil inflation adjustment, but disagreed with the idea that Isaac should have relied solely on operating expenditures. \"Money spent on construction projects is still money being spent,\" she said.\n\nSecond, Taylor noted that although Isaac said \"the past 20 years,\" his data set ends in 2008, overlooking the three most recent school years including the two affected by the cuts lawmakers approved in 2011.\n\nThat\u2019s understandable in the case of the foundation\u2019s report, which was written in 2010. However, Isaac made his statement more than a year after lawmakers completed the 2012-13 budget. Even so, Isaac would not have been able to compare actual spending numbers for 2011-12, because they won\u2019t be published until spring 2013. The 2010-11 data was out, but also would not have included the 2011 legislative cuts.\n\nTroxclair told us Isaac relied on the 2010 report because it was the most comprehensive analysis available from the foundation.\n\nThe state\u2019s budgeted amounts, rather than dollars actually spent, came out March 8, 2012, so we ran those over a 20-year period to see how the cuts might change the picture. Budgeted amounts for 1992-2012 showed mostly smaller increases than actual spending in 1988-2008, particularly in operating costs: Total budgeted spending was up 72 percent compared to 1992, or 20 percent per pupil. Operating budgeted spending was up 69 percent, or 17 percent per pupil.\n\nPencils down!\n\nOur ruling\n\nIsaac said, \"Over the past 20 years, expenditures for education have increased 142% and Texas\u2019 per-pupil costs have increased from $3,659 to $11,024 after adjusting for inflation.\"\n\nHe\u2019s correct that, adjusted for inflation, total spending went up 142 percent from 1988 through 2008. But that leaves out recent years, including those affected by 2011\u2019s legislative changes. And focusing on the increase alone without taking into account growth factors, especially enrollment, can be misleading.\n\nA different measure, budgeted total spending, rose 72 percent from 1992 through 2012.\n\nIsaac indicated that per-pupil spending had tripled after adjusting for inflation. The correct amounts show it didn\u2019t even double.\n\nSo while Isaac\u2019s comment has an element of truth -- spending did increase -- his first declared fact lacks vital context and the second is a substantial overstatement. We rate the overall statement as Mostly False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10012"}
