(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nDeere did not respond to PolitiFact\u2019s questions about the post.\nBut Biden told reporters after his inauguration\u00a0that Trump had left him a \"very generous letter.\" Like Deere, he declined to disclose any details and said, \"because it was private, I won't talk about it until I talk to him.\"\u00a0\nThere\u2019s no evidence that the letter is real. The seal at the top of the letter is not the same seal featured in other official letters Trump sent when he was president. And letters from Trump that have been made public have the month before the day, not the day before the month as it appears here.\nThe letter is being shared among people who believe the QAnon conspiracy theory. We found no credible sources to confirm the letter\u2019s authenticity. It seems more akin to the guesses other people are jokingly making about the letter\u2019s contents.\nWe rate this claim False.\nUpdate:\u00a0This story was updated to include new comments from President Joe Biden.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19194"}
