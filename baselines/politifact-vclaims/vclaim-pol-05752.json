Really?\nNo.\nWe reached out to Trump\u2019s campaign for more information on the figure, but did not hear back. However, according to data from the Census Bureau, the U.S. trade deficit with China clocked in at $343 billion in 2014. That makes Trump off by more than 31 percent.\nFor comparison, a $343 billion trade gap is roughly the entire Gross Domestic Product of Denmark.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo far, the trade deficit for 2015 has been calculated through September 2015, totalling almost $274 billion. Over the last 12 months of available data, the trade deficit has totaled $364 billion.\nThat\u2019s a big deficit but not more than $500 billion as Trump said.\nSince 1986, the yearly U.S. trade deficit with China has grown from year to year except in 2001 and 2009. See our chart for more information.\nOur ruling\nTrump said that \"we\u2019re losing now over $500 billion a year in terms of imbalance with China.\"\nLast month, Trump said almost $400 billion during a speech in Iowa. He should have stuck to that figure.\nThe 2014 trade deficit totaled $343 billion, and it\u2019s expected to be larger in 2015 but not more than $500 billion.\nTrump\u2019s claim rates Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05752"}
