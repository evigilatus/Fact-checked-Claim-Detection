The Students for Trump Twitter account, which has 287,000 followers, suggested North Carolina\u2019s Democratic secretary of state might have something to do with the slow counting.\u00a0\n\"It\u2019s going to take North Carolina 9 days to get in the final results. It took Florida a little less than 2 hours. Democrat Secretary of State vs. Republican Secretary of State,\" the account tweeted on Wednesday. Students for Trump is part of the conservative Turning Point Action organization.\nThe post was shared more than 1,400 times.\nIt\u2019s accurate to say North Carolina Secretary of State Elaine Marshall is a Democrat. In her first campaign for the office in 1996, she defeated racing legend Richard Petty. The secretary of state does not, however, count votes or control the election process.\u00a0\nWho counts the votes?\nThe confusion prompted the N.C. Secretary of State account to tweet about the confusion.\n\"Unlike many states, North Carolina's election process is administered by the N.C. State Board of Elections (@NCSBE), not the NC Secretary of State's Office. All questions or comments concerning election-related matters should be directed to the Board of Elections,\" the account tweeted on Wednesday.\nBallots are counted by each of North Carolina\u2019s 100 county elections boards, and then validated by the North Carolina State Board of Elections. North Carolina\u2019s elections board has five members, three of whom are Democrats.\u00a0\nNot only is the tweet wrong about North Carolina\u2019s election process, it wrongly suggests there\u2019s evidence of fraud or wrongdoing by North Carolina\u2019s ballot counters. So far, there is none.\nWhy the wait?\nIt may seem like this year\u2019s vote is taking longer than previous years, and there\u2019s a reason for that.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJenna Wadsworth\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth Carolina Secretary of State Elaine Marshall \"has won more statewide races than probably anyone else alive.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Paul Specht \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn previous elections, the officials stopped counting mail-in ballots three days after Election Day.\nThis year, the elections board pushed the deadline to Nov. 12.\u00a0\nThat decision didn\u2019t sit well with Republicans.\nThe North Carolina elections board\u2019s two Republicans resigned, and were replaced with two different Republicans last month.\nRepublican groups, including Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign, challenged the move in court. But the U.S. Supreme Court voted 5-3 to allow the later date, with Chief Justice John Roberts and conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh joining the court\u2019s three liberal justices in the majority.\nThat\u2019s all beside the point. To summarize what we\u2019re waiting on, state election officials cannot get an accurate picture of the total tallies until Nov. 12. A mail-in ballot will be counted in North Carolina so long as it was:\n\n\nProperly filled-out and witnessed,\n\n\nPostmarked on or before Election Day, and\n\n\nReceived by 5 p.m. on Nov. 12.\n\n\nThe deadline for ballots may be new. But it isn\u2019t evidence of wrongdoing.\nOur ruling\nThe Students for Trump account suggested that North Carolina\u2019s \"Democrat Secretary of State\" played a role in the state\u2019s prolonged ballot-counting process. That\u2019s not the case.\nWe rate this claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18467"}
