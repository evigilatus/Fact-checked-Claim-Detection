Chris Christie \n\nRaymond Bateman, a former Republican state senator and assemblyman who lost a bid for governor in 1977, said in a recent column that Booker seems like the only Democrat capable of foiling Christie\u2019s prospects for a second term.\n\n\"Unless Booker gets into the race, 2013 reminds me of 1985. That was the year Tom Kean made history with the largest-ever New Jersey gubernatorial victory,\" Bateman wrote in a Nov. 23 column published in The Asbury Park Press. \"Kean, who barely won (by 1,797 votes) in 1981, destroyed his 1985 opponent, Peter Shapiro, winning by a majority of more than 750,000 votes, the largest winning margin for a gubernatorial candidate in Jersey history.\" \n\n\"In any case,\" Bateman wrote later in his column, \"2013 should see a political barn-burning election in New Jersey that I believe will produce a Kean-like victory for Christie if, in fact, he runs.\"\n\nThis week Christie announced he will seek a second term. Potential Democratic rivals -- including Booker -- have not formally declared their intentions. \n\nThe outcome of any matchup wouldn\u2019t be determined until next year, but until then PolitiFact New Jersey wondered whether Bateman\u2019s comparison was rooted in fact. Did Kean, a Republican, rebound from a close election to a historically decisive re-election bid?\n\nThe data -- whether it\u2019s broken down by total votes or percentages -- shows that\u2019s true.\n\nMore than 1.37 million New Jerseyans cast their vote for Kean that year, while Shapiro, the Democratic candidate and a former Essex County executive, won about 578,000 votes.\n\nSo Kean won by more than 790,000 votes, according to election data published in the state\u2019s legislative manual. \n\nNo other governor in New Jersey\u2019s history has won election by a larger margin. \n\nIn all, Kean won more than 69 percent of the vote, carrying every one of New Jersey\u2019s 21 counties and all but three municipalities.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that \u00a0Kean\u2019s sweeping victory came four years after he narrowly won office. In 1981 Kean defeated Democrat Jim Florio by fewer than 1,800 votes, which represented less than one twelfth of one percent of the total vote.\n\nNo other gubernatorial race was closer as a percentage of the total vote, though in 1880 the Democratic candidate won by only 651 votes. That accounted for about one-quarter of one percent of the total vote. \n\nOur ruling\n\nBateman said that in the 1985 general election Kean had \"the largest winning margin for a gubernatorial candidate in Jersey history.\"\n\nKean trounced his opponent that year. \n\nThe former Republican governor won more than 1.37 million votes, compared with the roughly 578,000 ballots cast for his Democratic rival. \n\nThat means Kean won by more than 790,000 votes. That\u2019s the largest margin of victory for a gubernatorial election in New Jersey\u2019s history.\n\nWe rate this statement True. \n\nTo comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com. \n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09966"}
