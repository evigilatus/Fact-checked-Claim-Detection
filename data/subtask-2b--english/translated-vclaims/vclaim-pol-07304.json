For this reason, it is not surprising that the National Commission of the Republican Congress - the electoral arm of the Republican House of Representatives - has created declarations confirming the degree to which weak democratic rulers voted with Obama. We recently found two NRCC announcements using almost identical language at this point. Here, we will verify the validity of a declaration targeting the Democratic Republic of Nick Rahul from West Virginia. In a separate item, we will verify the validity of a declaration attacking the Democratic Republic of Georgia, John Barrow. Rahul, who was first elected in 1976, represents an area in which the Republicans gave Mitt Romney a major winning margin from 32 points on Obama in the 2012 presidential election. It ranks second among the most democratic regions of the Republic currently represented in the House of Representatives, making it a major opportunity for the General Democratic Party to take power. (Most of the democraticly controlled regions of the Republic are Utah, which is occupied by retired Republicans Jim Matheson. Rahul is facing the state of San Ivan Jenkins in November at race analysts saying he's one of the most vulnerable seats the Democrats hold. The declaration against Rahul represents one of its components, Carrie Oferby from Huntington, W.Va. She says: \"In cases of interest, Nick Rahul's voice with Barack Obama, whether it be spending, trade, EPA regulations, or Obama's care. When you say that, the text on the screen says, \"Nick Rahul voted with Obama 94 percent of the time.\" In a much smaller type, the footnotes to this allegation refer to the \"quarterly analysis of Congressional voice 2009.\" On January 13, 2021, bloggers mentioned the remarkable facts in a story in which General David H. Berger, commander of the United States Navy, said that they rejected Nancy Belusi's request for marine security, and told her that we were \"not working for you.\" By Samantha Butterman, on January 17, 2021, as data from 2009 was now five years old, we had a hunch that the National Rescue Committee had ignored a few years with lower percentages. It turns out we were right. Data from the same study showed that Rahul voted with Obama 88 per cent of the time in 2010, 65 per cent in 2011, 64 per cent in 2012 and 58 per cent in 2013. (Footnotes for 2014 not yet published) This is no less than Barrow, which was targeted in the accompanying announcement; the Barrow ratio fell to 28 per cent in 2012. However, it shows a degree of independence in voting by Rahul, which is not reflected in the NRCC Declaration. It is clear that the 94% vote with Obama was more attractive than being highlighted by the National Reconciliation Council, but amounted to cherry selection. When West Virginia voters were asked to justify the use of five-year-old data and ignore subsequent figures, Norwegian Refugee Council spokesman Ian Rywer said: \"It is important that voters in West Virginia know that in 2009, when Democrats controlled all of the Government's cranes and could push legislation through the two Houses of Congress, Nick Rahul voted with Barack Obama at 94 per cent of the time, including the Obama budget, which included the cap and trade plan and $3 billion, or 37 per cent, increased funding by EPA to advance its climate agenda.\" Our verdict in the NRC announcement said: \"Nick Rahul voted with Obama 94 percent of the time.\" Rahul actually voted with Obama 94 percent of the time -- but that was in 2009, a fact mentioned in the Declaration, though in a small type. Between 2010 and 2013, Rahul &apos; s vote was less consistent with Obama, at 58 per cent in 2013, the latest year for which data are available. The statement is partially accurate, but it ignores important details or takes things out of context, so we evaluate it half right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07304"}
