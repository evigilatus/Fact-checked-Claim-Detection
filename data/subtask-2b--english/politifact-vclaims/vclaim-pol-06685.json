While proponents of the policy shift argue that the changes won\u2019t spur additional fees or taxes, opponents argue the opposite.\n\"This is essentially a massive tax increase on the middle class being passed in the dead of night without the American public really being made aware of what is going on,\" Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, wrote in an email through the anti-FCC regulation group Protect Internet Freedom.\nOn the other hand, FCC spokesperson Kim Hart told PolitiFact that the policy \"does not raise taxes or fees. Period.\"\nWho\u2019s right here? Estimates of the impact on consumers -- in terms of Internet service bill fees and taxes -- range from $0 to $11 billion. Politicians can make a case that the policy will bump up service bills for the 85 million households with Internet, but there are too many unknowns to make such a definitive statement as Lee\u2019s.\nThe proposal\nNet neutrality is complicated. In general, it\u2019s the idea that Internet service providers (like Comcast) should not be able give preferential treatment to one website over another.\nAccordingly, the solution is also complex. The FCC voted to reclassify Internet service providers as common carriers under Title II of the Telecommunications Act, meaning they will be treated as public utilities, like phone service -- subject to more regulation than they are now. (A previous fact-check covered this in more detail.)\nThe full text of the proposal wasn\u2019t available to the public before the vote, when Lee made his comments, though its general principles were widely understood. But, a fact sheet says it \"will not impose, suggest or authorize any new taxes or fees.\"\nMore importantly, Congress recently reauthorized the 1998 Internet Tax Freedom Act, which bans new taxes on Internet service. There\u2019s legislation in the works to make this law permanent. That means the FCC couldn't levy taxes on its own even if it wanted to.\u00a0\nThere\u2019s a big caveat, though. The Internet Tax Freedom Act bans taxes, but not fees. Fee revenue is set aside specifically for, in this case, a telecom-related service. Taxes, in contrast, raise general revenue. They\u2019re legally different, but functionally the same from the consumer\u2019s perspective. Many experts say consumers can expect additional fees.\nSome say the FCC has left the door open for attaching federal-level fees in the future. Regardless, the FCC can\u2019t stop states and municipalities from tacking on their own fees.\nThe estimates\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHogan Gidley\n\n\nstated on January 17, 2021 in a Fox News interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump \u201ccan\u2019t say anything (about the U.S. Capitol riot) because the platforms have removed him.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 18, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe nationwide annual impact on Internet broadband subscriber bills could reach a maximum $11 billion, as a result of new taxes and fees, according to a December report out of the Progressive Policy Institute, a center-left think tank (it identifies with former President Bill Clinton\u2019s New Democrats). They recently lowered their estimate from $15 billion.\nFor the study, the researchers assumed that state and local governments would take every fee currently applied to a telecom service and apply them to internet service -- because household Internet will become a telecom service.\nFor example, the state of California charges telecom companies fees for special telecom-related services for the deaf and disabled, among other programs. Companies then pass these fees along to consumers.\nIt makes sense that a state would want to apply already-established telecom fees to Internet service to increase revenue, said study author Hal Singer, in an interview with PolitiFact. He pointed out that Vermont\u2019s director of telecom services has said the state would strongly consider levying fees on broadband Internet for the purpose of increasing Internet accessibility.\nSome net neutrality experts take issue with the study because of what the authors chose to include or leave out.\n\"The PPI study has been thoroughly discredited,\" said Joshua Stager, policy counsel at the Open Technology Institute, noting that it was \"disingenuous\" of the study to ignore the Internet Tax Freedom Act in the first place.\nThere is no guarantee that every state would choose to levy every fee. In some states, the legislatures would have to take action before it could happen.\u00a0The report also assumes that federal fees will apply, but that\u2019s still up in the air.\nTaking a different look at the PPI findings, the Free Press advocacy group argues that the potential fee burden could be around $4 billion, or as little as nothing. (Though Singer fervently rebutts their argument.)\nPersonal finance website Nerd Wallet did their own assessment and settled on a possible $6.25 billion impact. They broke their estimates down by state and found that households would see an annual increase in their Internet service bills anywhere between $8 in Delaware and $131 in Pennsylvania. They estimate that the average American household will see their bill increase $67 annually.\n\"I\u2019d say claiming that this order will be a \u2018massive tax on the middle class,\u2019 is an overstatement,\" said Doug Brake, telecom policy analyst at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. \"But it is also true that we will likely see new fees on broadband as a result of reclassification.\"\nOur ruling\nLee said the FCC\u2019s net neutrality policy \"is essentially a massive tax increase.\"\nLiterally, there won\u2019t be any new taxes as a result of the FCC changes, but there will likely be additional fees. There\u2019s a wide range of estimates -- anywhere from zero to $11 billion a year. Lee\u2019s comment doesn\u2019t account for the fact that the impact on consumers\u2019 service bills is far from certain, and a telecom policy analyst said it's an overstatement to call the potential increases \"massive.\"\nThe statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06685"}
