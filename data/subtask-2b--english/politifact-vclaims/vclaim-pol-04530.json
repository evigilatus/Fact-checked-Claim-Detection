We did the math using square miles and found that there is actually one Border Patrol agent per every 23.77 square miles in Arizona. That comes out to .4 agents per every 10 square miles.\nSo Terry-Willis\u2019 math is off. But Border Patrol notes that trying to use the state\u2019s total square miles as a statistic is irrelevant since most agents are deployed far to the south, closer to the border. The number of agents per linear mile is much higher.\nIn fiscal year 2015, the Tucson, Ariz., sector had 3,991 Border Patrol agents covering 262 linear miles of border. That\u2019s just over 15 agents per mile. The Yuma, Ariz., sector had 804 Border Patrol agents covering 126 linear miles of border. That\u2019s just over six agents per mile.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth sectors cover the more than 360 total miles along the Arizona-Mexico border, as well as the rest of the state.\nBorder Patrol also notes that agents are deployed to areas based on the threat of criminal activity.\nIn their 2012-16 strategic plan, they even outline a \"risk-based approach\" to patrolling the border.\nMichael Lytle, a criminal justice professor and border security expert at the University of Texas at Brownsville, notes that there are some agents in more places along the border than others.\nTechnology, terrain and other barriers could be at play.\n\"Patterns of activity shape a section of the border, and may not necessitate the presence of an officer on that particular milemarker,\" Lytle said.\nOur ruling\nTerry-Willis said, in Arizona,\"there are only one and a half (Border Patrol) agents per every 10 square miles.\"\nBased on our calculations, she actually overestimates the number of Border Patrol agents compared to square miles. But that\u2019s still misleading -- and leaves out important context.\nMost Border Patrol agents survey areas closer to the Arizona-Mexico border, not the rest of the state. The number of agents per linear mile is much higher.\nWe rate the statement False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/09e06b8f-2783-494a-bf52-bfb4f264e462", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04530"}
