Instead, we have a numerical war -- an arms race of ranks and comparisons on the economy before and after Scott Walker. Yeah. Here at Polyte Fact, that's the way we like it. The new Republican Governor's plan \"Wisconsin's rack\" -- a platform for his re-election in 2014 -- includes a series of ranks and statistics in 62 pages (and 208 footnotes). Many of these classifications compare Walker's time in the state government with his democratic challenge, Mary Burke. The Secretary of the State Department of Commerce was led by Jove. Jim Doyle from early 2005 to late 2007. Among the comparisons: \"Since Governor Walker took office, Wisconsin ranked eleventh in the state in overall enterprise growth compared to 47 years old Mary Burke was a business secretary.\" Walker protested tax cuts and other movements helped stimulate the growth of small businesses. But is he right in order? Before the Great Recession, was Wisconsin an essential feeder for business growth, compared to a show near Top 10 now? Definition of terms first: let us define \"business growth.\" It is not a reference to job growth, or even the creation of new jobs, so it does not carry the weight of these figures. The phrase is some of the terms courtesy of the United States Office of Labour Statistics, the agency that publishes State data every quarter on employment-related measures. Contrary to what the phrase might suggest, it is not a question of the number of companies that have been incorporated or formed, as compared to the number of companies that have been folded or otherwise died. Instead, \"businesses\" means a commercial site, such as a new place, a new factory or a new farm. One company can have multiple \"institutions,\" and new \"institutions\" can be opened by existing or new companies. The data are derived from a very large census of employers and economists using them as an indicator of net business activity. Walker quotes the statements as backups of the claim, and we agree that the correct data is to look at his specific drafting statement. On January 9, 2021 on Twitter, \"it was not all women who lost jobs (in the December work report), most of whom were black and Latin women. In fact, white women got a job.\" And in the history of Nosiapa Mezan on January 15, 2021, we started with Burke's time in business. Her tenure as President of Economic Development coincides well with the quarterly data collection process, although it is quite inconsistent. It began in February 2005 and left in November 2007. We used the last quarter of 2004 as our starting point, and the same quarter of 2007 as the end point. We only looked at private sector figures because Walker and Burke focused on economic growth in that sector. The numbers showed an order 47, just as Walker claimed. (It was lower if the first quarter of 2005 was used as a baseline as an indication that Burke arrived in the middle of the quarter.) The number of new institutions grew by 1.3 per cent in the three-year period from 2005 to 2007, just before Michigan, Massachusetts and Maine. Arizona, Nevada and Florida were at the top of the pile, with growth of more than 14 per cent. Illinois had the highest rank in the Middle West (11th). Walker compared the time of Burke's trade to what has happened since he took office. There's no data source we found that leads us to the present -- or even close. This is because there is a long delay in reporting quarterly data. (Information for the first quarter of 2014 is due to be published on 18 September 2014.) We have considered the most recent data, covering the period 2011-2013, the first three years Walker has served in his post. In this period, the growth rate in Wisconsin (5.5%) was the highest of 11, only after Iowa (10) and Illinois (9). So Walker's claim is on solid ground. Certainly, the \"enterprise\" arrangement does not necessarily coincide with the separate arrangement for net post gains in the state. For example, during the first three years of Walker's life, Wisconsin was 35 for job growth in the private sector, but 11 for enterprise growth. There was a much stronger connection during the Burke era -- the state ranked 42nd in private employment gains from 2005-2007, and 47th in the pace of new business \"enterprises.\" What should we read in these \"institutional\" growth figures? It is important to bear in mind that statistics do not distinguish between the size of companies being established and closed, according to economist Brian Jacobsen, Senior Policy Expert for the management of the Welsh Fargo Funds in the Minomoni Falls. \"If you have a lot of companies with one to four employees being created, you can get a good arrangement for the number of companies being created, but a bad arrangement for overall employment growth,\" he said. The Walker scheme of the second phase of our assessment said that since he took office, \"Wickensen has ranked 11th in the state in total enterprise growth compared to the 47th meeting in the years when Mary Burke was a business secretary.\" These numbers, although they do not cover the full time of Walker as Governor, are the last available ones and they support Walker's statement. We're evaluating the statement right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07292"}
