Are there really that many students stuck on waitlists?\nBrooke Medina, communications director for the Civitas Institute, said her group estimated the number of students waiting to get into schools of choice \u2006\u2014 which include private schools and charter schools\u2006\u2014 to be approximately 56,631.\nShe said that number came from two sources: The students on waitlists for scholarships or state funds to help them afford private schools, and the students on waitlists to enroll in public charter schools.\nWaitlists for scholarships\nIn the first category, Medina said Civitas Institute looked at the Opportunity Scholarship Program, the Disabilities Grant Program and the Education Savings Account.\nAccording to the North Carolina State Education Assistance Authority, 7,593 of 8,113 eligible applicants got Opportunity Scholarships \u2014 which provide up to $4,200 per year and are commonly known as school vouchers \u2014 in 2018-19.\nMedina said Civitas Institute counted the 520 eligible applicants who did not get scholarships as being on a waitlist.\nBut Kathryn Marker, director of grants, training and outreach for the NCSEAA, said these students were not actually placed on a physical waitlist. They were simply not awarded the money because the number of eligible\u00a0kindergarten and first-grade students receiving scholarships had already reached the program's assigned cap.\nIt would have been more accurate to say the students were \"unable to be awarded the scholarship because of the cap,\" she said.\nThe same is true for the Disabilities Grant Program, which covers tuition, fees and some other expenses for students with disabilities. Only 833 of 1,164 eligible students received this grant, leaving 331 students out, according to the NCSEAA.\nThe Education Savings Account, a program that awards state funds to parents of students with disabilities, gave out 347 grants, according to the NCSEAA. But the data did not say how many of the 1,430 total applicants were eligible.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedina said Civitas Institute assumed that a similar proportion of applicants would have been eligible for both the Education Savings Account and the Disabilities Grant Program, so the group estimated that approximately 780 students would have been rejected.\nTogether, these three numbers total 1,631 students.\nWaitlists for charter schools\nThe rest of the nearly 60,000 students on waitlists are those hoping to enroll in publicly-funded charter schools, Medina said.\nCharter schools operate outside school districts under the direction of independent governing boards. They were adopted into state law in 1996, and now 185 of them serve more than 100,000 students throughout North Carolina.\nAccording to a 2018 report from the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction, there were 55,165 students on charter school waitlists as of December 2017.\nBut this figure comes with some caveats, which the report spells out.\n\"This figure reflects a point in time \u2014 waitlists could change daily \u2014 and cannot be verified as an unduplicated count of students \u2014 as a student could be on multiple school waitlists,\" the report said, adding that it was based on the \"best information available.\"\nMedina acknowledged that duplicates could have skewed her group\u2019s estimate, but suggested that the 55,165 figure could actually be an underestimate because only 134 of the 185 charter schools (173 at the time of the report) provided waitlist data. To be safe, however, she said her group rounded the number down to 55,000 students.\n\"We've presented this aggregate as an estimate,\" Medina said. \"Despite this, we believe it is a reasonable one.\"\nSo to recap, Civitas Institute counted about 55,000 students on charter school waitlists, plus another 1,631 students who missed out on scholarship money for private schools.\nThat makes a total of 56,631\u00a0students, which is close enough to support the claim that \"almost 60,000\" students were on waitlists. But with so many caveats at play, the group should have been clearer that its number was an estimate.\nOur ruling\nCivitas Institute said \"there are almost 60,000 North Carolina children on waiting lists to access a school that works best for them.\"\nThis number seems reasonable, but there are some caveats that should have prompted the group to note in its tweet that its figure was an estimate.\nWe rate this statement Mostly True.\nCorrection: A previous version of this story incorrectly\u00a0said eligible students did not receive Opportunity Scholarships due to a cap on\u00a0program funding. But\u00a0the\u00a0number of\u00a0scholarships was actually\u00a0limited by a separate cap\u00a0that says no more than 40 percent of the program's\u00a0funds can be used toward kindergarten and first-grade students. Our ruling remains the same.\nThis story was produced by the North Carolina Fact-Checking Project, a partnership of McClatchy Carolinas, the Duke University Reporters\u2019 Lab and PolitiFact.
