Cooper represented the state through the trial and appellate court levels. But after the unanimous and strongly worded ruling against the state from the federal 4th Circuit Court of Appeals, Cooper said he wouldn\u2019t pursue another appeal.\n\"I think this is what we\u2019re going to have,\" he said, according to The News & Observer.\nGov. Pat McCrory, the Republican incumbent whose seat Cooper is trying to take this November, blasted him for that. McCrory later announced the state would ask the U.S. Supreme Court to reverse the ruling, even without Cooper.\n\"If any North Carolina citizen decided not to do their job, they would no longer have a paycheck,\" McCrory said in a press release. \"Roy Cooper should not be held to a different standard. Roy Cooper\u2019s refusal to do his job is costing taxpayers money, so his office must reimburse taxpayers immediately.\"\nCooper makes $127,561 a year, and we\u2019ll let others decide if he should work for free instead. We wanted to look into McCrory\u2019s claim that \"Roy Cooper\u2019s refusal to do his job is costing taxpayers money.\"\nThat\u2019s a two-part issue: Is he refusing to do his job? And by not having his office represent the state on further appeal, is he costing the state money?\nConcerns with Cooper\nRepublican leaders said they didn\u2019t trust Cooper, since he has said he didn\u2019t personally agree with the voter ID law. So they hired outside lawyers to work alongside Cooper\u2019s employees.\nCooper\u2019s team won the voter ID case at trial \u2013 hardly the outcome of someone trying to sabotage it \u2013 before losing on appeal.\nBut McCrory spokesman Ricky Diaz said it was more than just Cooper\u2019s comments that led to the hiring of the private attorneys \u2013 it was the fact that Cooper\u2019s political campaign has received contributions from billionaire George Soros.\nSoros is a Democratic donor who has funded challenges to voting laws in several states, including North Carolina. Diaz said that\u2019s a conflict of interest that should have led Cooper to step down from office.\n\"There is precedent for attorneys general in North Carolina to resign while running for higher office when it conflicts with their duties,\" he said, citing former AG Robert Morgan, who resigned in 1974 to campaign full-time for the U.S. Senate.\nCooper\u2019s campaign disagrees.\n\"Attorney General Cooper is doing his job by advising the state when they have passed clearly unconstitutional laws that will not be upheld by the courts,\" said campaign spokeswoman Megan Jacobs.\nThe job of the attorney general\nWe\u2019ve already looked into an earlier claim, from N.C. Senate leader Phil Berger, that Cooper was not doing his job by refusing to defend the LGBT law known as House Bill 2, which is being challenged by individuals as well as the federal government.\nWe rated Berger\u2019s claim Half True. State law says the attorney general shall represent the state in court, and it doesn\u2019t give any exceptions. But legal experts say the attorney general does have valid reasons not to represent the state sometimes.\nFor instance, they argue, the AG takes an oath to uphold the constitution and thus shouldn\u2019t defend a law he truly believes is unconstitutional.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Steineke\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembly Republicans \u201chave come to the table\u201d and were part of \u201cgive and take\u201d compromise on a coronavirus bill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe voter ID situation isn\u2019t totally similar to the HB2 situation, though. While Cooper argued from the outset that HB2 was unconstitutional, his office did defend the state\u2019s voter ID law for years.\nSo can an attorney general start representing his state in court but stop before the matter is finished? Legal experts are split.\nMichael Gerhardt, a UNC-Chapel Hill law professor, said he thinks Cooper\u2019s actions on voter ID were acceptable. The question, he said, comes down to whether or not the AG is allowed to change his mind.\n\"My take is that he can,\" Gerhardt said.\nBut Campbell University law professor Gregory Wallace said he believes the AG\u2019s discretion is more limited, and stopping representation partway through a case deserves strong scrutiny.\n\"Refusing to defend should be rare and exceptional,\" he said. \"When it happens in several cases over a short period of time which all involve highly politicized issues relevant to the AG's campaign for governor, voters reasonably may infer that the AG\u2019s reasons are political, not constitutional.\"\nCooper has done this before.\nHe defended North Carolina\u2019s 2012 constitutional amendment banning gay marriage, for two years, until the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals struck down a similar ban in Virginia. Cooper then said he would not continue North Carolina\u2019s case, dubbing it a lost cause. The Supreme Court later proved him right, ruling in favor of gay marriage in 2015.\nLosing the state money?\nWhether or not Cooper\u2019s actions are within the scope of his power, it\u2019s a separate question whether he\u2019s costing the state more money by not defending the law. That could be the case if the state suddenly had to hire private attorneys to take up its cause.\nBut the state has been paying private attorneys from the start, even when Cooper was on the case. And it wasn\u2019t just one set of attorneys. McCrory\u2019s office hired one law firm, and the General Assembly hired a different law firm.\nIn total, according to a recent report by WRAL-TV in Raleigh, the legislature has spent more than $4.8 million in state funds on its outside lawyers. And we don\u2019t know how much extra McCrory has spent for the same case; WRAL said the governor\u2019s office did not respond to its records request.\nNoelle Talley, a spokeswoman for the N.C. Department of Justice, said the private lawyers didn\u2019t split up tasks with the state\u2019s lawyers.\n\"The work was duplicative,\" she said.\nSo really, Cooper is saving the state money. If the Supreme Court agrees to hear the case, lawyers from his office will not be traveling on the taxpayer dime to Washington, D.C., and the private attorneys who will argue it were already on the public payroll.\nTalley couldn\u2019t say exactly how much taxpayers might save, but the scenario she described includes savings in the hundreds of dollars \u2013 small savings, to be sure, but savings nonetheless.\n\"Travel expenses would likely have included airfare, a hotel room for a couple of nights, and meals for one attorney,\" she said.\nOur ruling\nGov. Pat McCrory said that in the voter ID lawsuit, Attorney General Roy Cooper\u2019s \"refusal to do his job is costing taxpayers money.\"\nThere is a question whether Cooper has the power to decide not to appeal further. But the issue of money is more clear \u2013 his decision is actually saving the state money.\nSince McCrory hit on a valid topic of debate with his claim about Cooper\u2019s job duties but missed the mark on his claim about money, we rate this claim Mostly False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/02b4f996-19fa-4685-900a-375e4d00ef82", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04466"}
