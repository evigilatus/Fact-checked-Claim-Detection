If so, with one partner, multiple partners or same-sex partners?\u2019\n\"Be ready to answer those questions and more the next time you go to the doctor, whether it\u2019s the dermatologist or the cardiologist and no matter if the questions are unrelated to why you\u2019re seeking medical help. And you can thank the Obama health law.\"\nMcCaughey then claims that the law offers incentive payments, and eventually penalties, to pressure doctors and hospitals to convert to electronic health records. She quotes a cardiologist saying sex questions are \"insensitive, stupid and very intrusive\" and a nephrologist declaring that new requirements turn your medical record \"into an interrogation, and the data will not be confidential.\"\nReaders sent us the op-ed and asked us to fact-check it. So does Obamacare require your dermatologist to ask you about your sex life?\n\u2018Sex questions\u2019\nWe talked with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, two members of a federal committee on health information technology, and the president of a national physicians group.\nWe reached out to McCaughey and the two doctors she quoted, but we didn\u2019t hear back.\n(The last time we rated a claim from McCaughey, it was her 2009 comment that the health care law would require mandatory counseling for Medicare patients \"that will tell them how to end their life sooner\" \u2014 a Pants on Fire falsehood.)\nHere\u2019s what we learned.\nThe federal government did create incentives and eventually penalties to encourage doctors and hospitals to make \"meaningful use\" of electronic health records. The government says the switch from paper will offer easier access to health records and data, provide reminders and alerts for doctors and patients, and reduce medical errors.\nThe change wasn\u2019t part of Obamacare, though. And it doesn\u2019t require any \"sex questions\" \u2014 except for whether you\u2019re male or female. You might hear the words, \"Are you sexually active?\" from your doctor, but it wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with the health care law.\nIn other words, McCaughey\u2019s claim was utterly at odds with the evidence.\n\"Arrgghhh \u2014 now I have heard it all!\" said Molly Cooke, president of the American College of Physicians.\nCooke, an internist, told PolitiFact that when she was in medical school in the 1970s, she was taught to ask:\n\u2022 Are you sexually active (with other people)?\n\u2022 If yes, are your partners men, women or both?\n\u2022 If no, is that out of choice, because you don\u2019t currently have an appealing partner, because you have no privacy, or some other reason?\n\u2022 Are you happy with your sex life, however it is?\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"My classmates and I were taught to ask all patients all four questions,\" she said. \"I am not saying that we always did it, but these questions are as old as the hills.\"\nThe rationale is that patients\u2019 answers may reveal important information about their health, safety and well-being, she said. Her medical practice happens to focus on patients with HIV and other complex chronic illnesses.\nBut let\u2019s say some doctors, such as the cardiologist quoted by McCaughey, find such questions \"insensitive, stupid and very intrusive.\"\nMcCaughey wrote that the president\u2019s \"reforms\" aim to \"turn doctors into government agents, pressuring them financially to ask questions they consider inappropriate and unnecessary.\"\nYet that cardiologist could earn government incentives for meaningful use of electronic health records whether he asked \"sex questions\" or not.\n\u2018Electronic health records\u2019\nWe looked at the specifications ourselves.\nThe financial push toward electronic records came not from the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, commonly called Obamacare, but from the federal stimulus bill the year before \u2014 the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.\nIn the first stage of the incentives program, paid through the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, doctors must use electronic records to keep up with basics on their patients.\nThey need to check for drug interactions, keep an up-to-date list of diagnoses, transmit prescriptions, keep medication and allergy lists, and record demographics and vital signs. They need to note preferred language, gender, race, ethnicity, date of birth, height, weight, blood pressure, body mass index, smoking status.\nThe demographic information helps doctors catch disparities in care, said Paul Tang, an internist who chairs the workgroup on \"meaningful use\" for the health information technology committee created by the Recovery Act.\nJust as with paper records, that information is protected by federal health privacy laws, such as HIPAA, and in some cases additional state law.\nIn the second stage, the requirements for doctors get more sophisticated, with provisions for electronic access for patients to their health information, ability to transmit data to immunization registries, and more. Some optional steps include entering electronic notes for at least 30 percent of the patients they see, and recording family health history as structured data.\nThere\u2019s a requirement to protect electronic health information. But there aren\u2019t any requirements to ask questions about sexual history.\nThat\u2019s not to say they won\u2019t be common: past medical history, family history and social history are fairly standard questions, and it would make sense for vendors of electronic health records systems to include them in their software.\nBut if McCaughey\u2019s cardiologist didn\u2019t want to ask, he could still collect government money for using the records.\nWhat makes McCaughey\u2019s claim even more bizarre is that it isn\u2019t necessary to exaggerate concerns about electronic health records. There\u2019s plenty of evidence-based debate about whether current privacy protections are enough in the new world of electronic records, and how to give patients a \"meaningful choice.\"\nA New York Civil Liberties Union report she mentions says current regulations don\u2019t give patients enough control over sensitive health information. A recent blog post at the website of the journal Health Affairs discusses how to earn patient trust and get meaningful consent for participation in health information exchange organizations.\nBut the federal push toward electronic health records doesn\u2019t require your doctor to grill you about your sex life.\nOur ruling\nMcCaughey says in \"Obamacare will question your sex life\" that you can thank the president\u2019s health law for questions about your sexual activity, even if your doctor finds them unnecessary.\nShe suggests it\u2019s part of Obamacare\u2019s move toward electronic health records. But incentives for electronic health records were part of the Recovery Act, not Obamacare. And they don\u2019t require participating doctors to ask questions about your sex life.\nMcCaughey frames her concern for patient privacy with an evidence-free attack on Obamacare that veers toward the ridiculous.
