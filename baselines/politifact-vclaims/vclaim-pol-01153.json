Complicating matters: a legal tug-of-war between Gov. Roy Cooper and the GOP-led legislature recently left the elections office without board members.\nTo rectify the situation, legislators last month approved a bill that would launch a new elections board on Jan. 31. Democrats reacted with suspicion to the bill, claiming that it affects the transparency of investigations into elections fraud.\n\"The NC GOP can\u2019t keep their story straight. They attacked the SBOE for lack of transparency. Now, they\u2019re ramming through a provision that\u2019ll make investigations like\u00a0#NC09\u00a0*less* transparent,\" the North Carolina Democratic Party\u00a0tweeted\u00a0on Dec. 27.\nCooper vetoed the bill and the legislature\u00a0overrode his veto\u00a0on Dec. 27, creating the new board.\nIs it true that the N.C. General Assembly approved legislation that\u2019ll reduce the transparency of investigations like the one into the Harris-McCready results? To rate the NC Democratic Party claim, we must look at the nature of that investigation.\nAs PolitiFact noted in a recent\u00a0fact check of the North Carolina Republican Party, the state elections board hasn\u2019t revealed much about the scope of its investigation, which is ongoing. But it appears to center on potential fraud in mail-in absentee ballots.\nDoesn\u2019t affect election fraud probes\nPolitiFact reviewed\u00a0the bill, and didn\u2019t find evidence that it hides the process of election fraud investigations. Part 5 of the bill, which addresses absentee ballot fraud investigations, doesn\u2019t mention anything about confidentiality. It says:\n\"By April 1, 2019, the State Board of Elections shall report and make recommendations to the Joint Legislative Elections and Ethics Oversight Committee on absentee ballot fraud. The report shall address all of the following: (1) Efforts to identify and investigate instances of potential mail-in ballot harvesting. (2) Data and statistics on the number of requests for mail-in absentee ballots, the number of returned mail-in absentee ballots for the past five election cycles, and any trends or patterns that appear analyzing those data and statistics. (3) Any other related matter identified by the State Board impacting voting absentee ballot.\"\n\u00a0\n\nThe law does, however, require investigations into potential campaign finance violations to be confidential, The\u00a0News & Observer reported.\nIt \"only makes campaign finance investigations confidential. Not election fraud,\" according to Gerry Cohen, former special counsel to the N.C. General Assembly and longtime legislative staffer.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJenna Wadsworth\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth Carolina Secretary of State Elaine Marshall \"has won more statewide races than probably anyone else alive.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Paul Specht \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nState Rep. David Lewis, a Harnett County Republican, was a lead negotiator of the bill. He said it affects campaign finance investigations, not allegations of other election law violations.\nHe added it may increase transparency. \"First, Part V of House Bill 1029 requires the State Board of Elections to formally report to the General Assembly absentee ballot problems in the last few years. There is no foreseeable reason that report won\u2019t be made public,\" Lewis said in an email to PolitiFact. \"Secondly, Section 4.9 requires additional information regarding absentee ballots to be transmitted to the State Board, which traditionally makes all of this information public.\"\nA different kind of investigation\nSo how does the law affect campaign finance violations?\nPreviously, the elections board has confirmed the existence of campaign finance investigations, The N&O reported. Under the new law, however, an investigation might only become widely known if charges are filed or the person making the accusation goes public.\nRobert Howard, a spokesman for the N.C. Democratic Party, believes the 9th district investigation could reveal campaign finance violations.\n\"Based on materials released by the State Board of Elections and sworn statements from residents in NC-09, there is clear reason to believe (Bladen County political operative) McCrae Dowless and others may have committed campaign finance violations in addition to operating an illegal ballot harvesting scheme,\" Howard said in an email. \"This year, the NCGOP, the Harris campaign, and Red Dome Group either contracted or sub-contracted with Dowless who then ran a paid-ballot harvesting operation, often\u00a0paying\u00a0employees in cash.\"\nHe continued: \"If an investigation like NC09 involved campaign finance violations and a separate violation (such as, in this instance, illegal ballot harvesting), investigators who are forced by this law to keep the campaign finance violation confidential may be forced to keep the full investigation confidential as well.\"\n\nHoward has a point. Materials disclosed by the state elections board allude to potential financial violations. But, while it\u2019s true that the board could find campaign finance violations as part of its probe, payoff questions aren\u2019t the stated holdup in the District 9 race.\nIn a Nov. 30 press release, the board has said it\u2019s reviewing \"irregularities and fraudulent activities related to absentee by-mail voting and potentially other matters in the 9th Congressional District contest.\"\nRegardless of what those \"other matters\" may turn out to be, the NC Democratic Party\u2019s tweet gives the impression that the bill obscures election fraud investigations \u2014 which it doesn\u2019t.\nOur ruling\nThe N.C. Democratic Party tweeted that legislators supported a provision \"that\u2019ll make investigations like\u00a0#NC09\u00a0less transparent.\" The bill, which is now law, potentially conceals allegations of campaign finance violations. But it doesn\u2019t affect the process for disclosing information related to election fraud investigations.
