This plan, which forms part of the 2012 budget of the House of Representatives, has authorized the Chamber without democratic support. Although he is certain to die in the Senate or the Obama office, Ryan &apos; s efforts to reduce the Government &apos; s role in providing health insurance to older persons are likely to remain an issue in the 2012 elections. Ryan, R-Wis. He is the Chairman of the Budget Committee of the House of Representatives. :: Deputy Jerry Connolly, a democracy from Fairfax County, recently sabotaged Ryan &apos; s plan to privatize a large part of medical care. Under this proposal, older persons will purchase special insurance policies and Uncle Sam will pay a fixed amount to insurance companies to help cover the plans. The system will begin in 2022 for every person aged 65 or under that year. \"A dollar of extra costs for older persons will not be used to reduce disability,\" said Connolly in a press release. Instead, the Republican Plan plans the pockets of private insurance companies. Is Connolly's comments correct? George Burke, Director of Communications, Connolly, said that the claim was based on expectations from the Congressional Budget Office that Ryan's plan would require older persons to pay more for health coverage but did not actually reduce government expenditures. He said that the scheme \"refinishes pockets\" of insurance companies because older persons would have to buy private insurance, which they do not have to do now. First, let's discuss how Ryan's plan will work. Under this legislation, persons aged 65 after 2022 receive a \"financial support payment\" from medical care, which is paid directly to an insurance company of their choice for the cost of purchasing private health insurance. The amount paid is expected to be approximately $8,000 in 2022 for a 65-year-old person in that year. As people grow older, the subsidy will increase. This is because health-care costs increase with age. The Ryan plan would increase the base amount paid each year by increasing the consumer price index. This would allow payments to keep pace with general inflation, although medical costs are rising much faster than total inflation. One of the results said by the organization is that future recipients of medical care \"will pay more for health care than they do under the current medical care system.\" Let's go back to Connolly now. We will begin by addressing the second part of his claim, namely, that requiring older persons to purchase private health insurance would \"cover pockets\" of private insurance companies. Although Connolly may be interesting, he is right about the basic details. If Americans start buying private insurance, with their own funds or government funds, the total premium levels for private health insurance companies will rise. Because the largest health insurance companies are publicly traded and seeking profits, it is a good bet that they will not offer lost medical care plans with money. However, insurance companies will have to meet the standards set by the Federal Government. They will have to pay the same allowance to everyone of the same age and cannot deny older persons coverage on the basis of pre-existing health conditions. The Ryan plan would provide higher insurance subsidies to low-income persons; those who account for the highest 8 per cent of income would receive smaller government payments. Connolly is therefore right in part of his claim. Ryan's plan will increase revenue from premiums in private insurance companies. We will not judge whether this means \"strengthening the pockets\" of these companies, given the lack of prospects for predicting profit margins that may be under these schemes within 10 years. And now let's examine Connolly's claim that \"no dollar will be used to reduce old people's disability costs.\" As we have stated, the Bureau of Social Affairs believes that older persons will pay more than their pockets for health care under Ryan's plan. It is therefore logical to increase costs for older persons. But as Joe Antos, the economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, suggests, if older people pay more, the government should end up paying less. The community organization estimates that health costs will be higher under Ryan &apos; s plan than under traditional medical care for a 65-year-old child in 2022. The reason for the increase, he says, is that \"administrative costs (including profits) and payment rates for service providers are higher for special plans than for medical care.\" Antos and Mark Goldwin, an economist at the New America Non-Party Foundation, said that government premium payments under the Ryan Plan would grow more slowly than medical care expenses under the current set-up. Although savings may initially be small, the Government &apos; s share of expenditure on medical care will decrease over time. These savings will be available for other programmes, including reduction of the deficit. Antos also said that such payments would encourage health insurance companies and health service providers to economy because older persons would not get blank checks to pay for tests and treatments. Health-care insurance companies and providers will have an incentive to \"enhance profits by providing more efficient care, and more efficient care.\" At the Liberal Centre for Budget and Policy Priorities, Paul van de Water used CBO information and its own accounts to estimate the cost difference between Ryan's plan and the current system. Under the current system, Van de Wotter states that a 65-year-old child pays $6,150 to cover premiums and costs of his or her own money for medical care and supplementary coverage. The government pays about $8,600. In 2022, he said that a 65-year-old child would see costs from his own funds doubled to $12,500, while the Government &apos; s share of the costs would be reduced by $600, to $8,000. So while the government will see some savings, Ryan's plan \" increases the overall health costs of beneficiaries far more than it reduces federal government spending,\" as Van de Water said. Dean Baker, another left-wing economist, said that the plan could save government money over time, but only at the expense of much higher payments than older persons. He said, like Van de Wotter and CBO, using private insurance companies would mean higher costs and more inefficiency. These deficiencies cost money. Let's review: Liberal economists don't like Ryan's plan and say it'll hurt older people, but they recognize that it will reduce government spending on health-care costs, at least over time. This contrasts with Connolly's assertion that there are no funds from such excess costs to help pay the deficit. It is true that new payments by older persons will go to private insurance companies, but savings from reduced government spending can go to deficit reductions. We appreciate Connolly's claim to half the right. Check the facts (Kirk Cox) was mentioned on January 13, 2021 in a speech.
