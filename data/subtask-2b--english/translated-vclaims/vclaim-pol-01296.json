Mike Post, Republican Congressman from South Illinois, says his democratic challenger, Brendan Kelly, embodies the definition. In an announcement sponsored by Bushet still works in the last days of the Congressional Campaign, Radio Kelly, the state attorney (provincial prosecutor) of St. Claire County, says \"he allowed half of the criminals he faced to walk freely.\" \"This is 50 percent free walk!\" The announcement is made in the 12th Congress Department of Illinois. Kelly's failure to protect women who had been subjected to violent abuse allowed offenders to cut unforgivable deals. This is a failed record.\" Fifty percent looks like a lot of criminals on the street. So we looked to see if the figures were accurate, and how they fit into the crime and prosecution outline. We can actually tell you that the numbers are true if \"free\" means surveillance -- not just for the cases that Kelly has tried but for those all over Illinois. \"Bost's scary announcement fails to observe the truth of the claim.\" Kelly &apos; s footwalking became a district prosecutor in 2010. The Post ad says Kelly let half the criminals he faced walk free. We asked the Bush campaign where I got this 50 percent figure, and we were told it came from public records in the court system. What's the exact number? Did the Post campaign consider every case in which Kelly and his office prosecuted, or did it use a sample? The Post campaign did not say: I repeat in a series of e-mails with us that the source of the allegation is public records. Looking at a variety of data at the national level, we get figures from the sentencing project and the United States Office of Justice Statistics. It appears that 50% was somewhere on the field everywhere. We then obtained specific data for each conviction in Illinois, thanks to annual reports from the state courts. 2016 is the most recent year, so we're going to use these figures here: out of 1,895 criminal defendants prosecuted by Kelly's office that year, 1,200 were convicted. That's a 63% conviction rate. So what happened to those 1,200 convicts? State records show that 392 of them, or 33 per cent, were sentenced to imprisonment. Much more, 788, I got the test. This means that 66% of the criminals who tried Kelly \"walked,\" using the term \"post,\" with surveillance. But how does that compare with state-wide figures? The conviction rate at state level -- for every defendant in Illinois in 2016 -- was 65 per cent, making Kelly almost identical. Of those convicted, 42 per cent went to prison. This is higher than Kelly County, but Cook Cotti, whose seat is Chicago, distorts the totals. If we look only at other provinces, Post is one point higher than the average. The trend was similar in 2015: 32 per cent of convicted offenders were sent to prison in Kelly County, 43 per cent of whom were throughout the state. Production of Cook County and the state-wide average is 33.5 percent. So prosecutors across the state allow criminals, in the words of Post, to \"walk freely.\" Marco Rubio mentioned on January 27, 2021 in his remarks \"Only in the Third World do you see this usual use of trials of former leaders.\" The commercial declaration also cites the records of the St. Clare District Court, without details, as the source. We asked for more information, and the Post campaign sent us summaries of four cases - each of which concerns a separate woman who has been subjected to violent abuse. In each case, the punishment imposed on the men concerned could have exceeded a decade in prison. But in each of these cases, a plea deal from Kelly's office led to a 24-month probation in three cases, and 30 months in the fourth. These deals allow predators to return to the street and put women and children in danger in our societies, the Post campaign said in an e-mail. Kelly's decisions on how to deal with cases were the subject of attacks by the Post or Post allies throughout the campaign. Some of the discussions stem from stories published in the Bellville News-Demarcat, including its 2015 series, \"Breach of Trust.\" One of the headlines on the Internet said it would be better: \"The victims of sexual crimes in South Illinois find that the police and prosecutors usually do not accuse their attackers. From 2005 to 2013, 70% of sexual offences did not reach the courtroom.\" The newspaper &apos; s investigation covered cases from 2005 to 2013. It found that only 18 per cent of the reported sexual offences against the police had been prosecuted by the state attorney in St. Clare County. Part of the problem is that prosecutors did not consider all reports of sexual assault to be sufficiently qualified or robust to prosecute. The trend in southern Illinois was not unique. The Minneapolis Star Tribune found that in the years 2015 and 2016, less than one in 10 sexual assaults resulted in a conviction. Other studies have also shown this. Kelly took office in 2010, so his office prosecuted cases covered by only three of the nine years of the newspaper investigation. But the trial rate has improved under Kelly's command. In 2012 and 2013, about 30 per cent of reports of sexual offences resulted in charges, as reported by News-Democrat, and the conviction rates for adult defendants were relatively high in these cases. When asked why prosecutors did not take on more cases, Kelly said to the democratic news: \"We want to condemn the guilty fairly, but more importantly, to seek as much justice as possible for the public and for the victims. That's why we're doing this. .................................................................................... There's no answer to the cake clipping.\" He also said that some suspects suspected of sexual offences might be prosecuted for non-sexual offences such as aggravated beating and unlawful restriction that might not appear in the newspaper investigation. He cited an example of an accused who had been tried and convicted of non-sexual offences in a case that also involved rape. Kelly and his campaign said they couldn't reveal all the details involved in a case, but the factors could include the best solution for the victim. When asked about the cases brought to us by the Post campaign, Elana Schrager's spokesman Kelly said: \"In each of these four cases, Brendan worked closely with each of the survivors to ensure that justice was done while respecting her wishes.\" Our ruling is that Kelly allowed half of the criminals she faced to walk free and failed to protect women who had been subjected to violent abuse. The Post campaign did not provide accurate information when we asked her over and over again, but we found her anyway. If the test is viewed as allowing a free walker, Kelly is guilty -- as is the case for prosecutors throughout Illinois. There was only a reverse trend in very few provinces. Similarly, based on data from the Belleville News-Demarcat newspaper, as well as data from the Federal Court, we have also found that the general use of Pusht plea agreements falls within the parameters of interstate trade rates and national guilty pleas. With regard to the claim that Kelly \"failed to protect women,\" the Post campaign stated that it was based on court cases. The information he sent us showed four men being monitored instead of jail. The information does not provide any precise differences in the prosecution of each case. With all this in mind, the POST numbers are good, but they largely obscure the fact of prosecution throughout his country. There is no doubt that there are critics of the way Kelly dealt with the cases, and there are also those who praise him. This is much of the context to be considered. Based on what we can measure and on the principles of \"truth-O-Meter\" -- specifically, the evaluation of a claim that contains an element of truth but is misleading -- we often assess this wrong.
