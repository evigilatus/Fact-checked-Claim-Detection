In a recent radio announcement, Shahin Brown was accused of being very friendly with Wall Street when he was a senator from nearby Massachusetts from 2010 to 2012. Here's the 60-second announcement: \"I wonder why Scott Brown lost his re-election in Massachusetts? Well, he was working for Wall Street, not people. Scott Brown suspended a major financial reform bill so he could tell it and save Wall Street for $19 billion. Scott Brown already arrived at Wall Street, said Boston Globe. Even after the passage of the bill, news reports show that Brown was \"in secret serving the interests of Wall Street, working behind the scenes to help big banks, not consumers.\" \"Wall Street Scout Brown by giving him more contributions than any other candidate in the campaign - $5.3 million. Now, Scott Brown wants New Hampshire to send him to Washington. Once again Wall Street spends millions to help. Scott Brown says he really cares about New Hampshire. Come on, don't be fooled. No matter where he lives, Scott Brown will put Wall Street first. That's good for Scott Brown, but not New Hampshire.\" That's too much to chew. Polyte Fact New Hampshire has already verified the claim of a Shahin group that Brown's actions provided \"big banks\" of $19 billion in taxes, and ranked it mostly wrong. But what about the claim that Wall Street gave him campaign donations more than any other candidate -- $5.3 million? We decided to take a closer look. The Shaheen campaign referred us to accounts by the Centre for Responsive Policy, whose website Pointsecurts.org tracked a wide range of data to fund the campaign. It's a reliable source that we've used many times in the past. The Shahin campaign figure of $5.3 million indicates how much Brown got in the 2012 campaign cycle -- when he lost his democracy seat to Elizabeth Warren -- from donors classified as part of the finance, insurance and real estate sector. Their dollar number is correct - as is Brown's. One arrangement between all senators for donations from that sector -- but Shaheen's announcement extends a little bit when he calls this \"Wall Street.\" Most \"financial\" companies have a reasonable claim to be part of Wall Street, but many insurance and real estate sectors fall outside that category. Also, not everyone working in these companies is a financial mogul, but their individual donations are still calculated in total. So we decided to dig a little deeper. We found some subcategories of \"finance/insurance/real estates\" that are closer to \"Wal Street.\" \u2022 Securities and investment: Brown was ranked first among the candidates for the Senate in the 2012 campaign cycle, with 2,682,872 candidates. Facebook published on January 27, 2021, in Facebook, says that Joe Biden canceled the Keystone pipeline because Warren Buffett \"doned $58 million\" for his campaign. \u2022 29 January, 2021: Private equity and investment companies: Brown took first place, making donations amounting to $556,092. \u2022 Hudge funds: Brown was ranked first with donations of $306,800. \u2022 Investment capital: Brown was ranked first with $262,081 in donations. This provides support for the idea that Brown has ranked her second. One in these kinds of donations. However, it is slightly lower in two other categories: finance and credit companies: Brown ranked ninth with $54,450 in donations. \u2022 Commercial banks: Brown was ranked third with contributions of $297,539. At the same time, Brown &apos; s withdrawal from these six categories totalled approximately $4.2 million, or about five less than in the Declaration. This is not the first time that Shahin's campaign has used rather loose language in describing donors to Brown. When he claimed that \"big oil gave Scott Brown $454,260,\" we assessed this claim as half correct, noting that only about 11.5 per cent of Brown's wealth came from companies and individuals affiliated with the largest multinational corporations - what most viewers consider to be \"big oil.\" When we contacted Brown's staff, Elizabeth Geighton's spokesman said: \"The fund-raising from Scott Brown is no different from the fund-raising from Jean Shahin in that they accept contributions from the financial services industry. The only difference is that Jane Shahin is attacking him for it. However, in the 2012 election cycle - when Brown received $5.3 million from the finance/insurance/real estate sector - Shaheen accepted only $64,139 from the same sector, ranked 65th among all senators. At the current session, $565,935 was accepted from the finance/insurance/real estate sector, ranked twenty-first among senators. The Governor Shahin announcement said that in 2012, Wall Street and Scott Brown gave more donations than any other candidate -- $5.3 million. If six categories are collected that can reasonably be considered \"Wall Street,\" Brown received approximately $4.2 million in total, and first terminated among candidates in the Senate in four of these six categories. However, the total amount is less than the $5.3 million claimed in the declaration. The statement is generally precise but requires further clarification or information, so we often evaluate it correctly.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07276"}
