Pat McCrory of a short-sighted move to divert emergency funds into defending a partisan controversy.\n\"Gov. McCrory took $500,000 directly out of the disaster relief fund,\" Cooper said during their Oct. 11 debate. \"And you know what it\u2019s for? House Bill 2.\"\nHB2, or the \"bathroom bill\" as it\u2019s commonly known, has become one of the defining issues of this election. There are several parts to it, including restricting bathroom access for transgender people in public buildings and excluding LGBT people from discrimination protections.\nWe\u2019ve written many fact-checks on HB2, including whether it took away any existing rights, how unique North Carolina\u2019s LGBT protections (or lack thereof) are now, and the risk of sexual predators due to transgender-friendly bathroom rules. For all our fact checks on the law, see here.\nMcCrory signed HB2 in March. Since then private citizens have sued, and so has the U.S. Department of Justice, which argues it violates civil rights laws. Cooper, as attorney general, has refused to defend HB2 in court. He says he believes it\u2019s unconstitutional. We fact-checked whether he\u2019s allowed to do that here.\nWith Cooper out, the state will have to hire other lawyers \u2013 unless the legislature repeals HB2, which Cooper has urged but which legislative leaders have so far refused to do.\nAnd that\u2019s what brings us to this claim. Cooper said McCrory pulled $500,000 from disaster funds to use for those lawyers, but McCrory retorted it wasn\u2019t true.\n\"We haven\u2019t spent one dollar of the disaster relief money. We were approved to by the legislature, and I made a statement: We will not spend any of that money. (Cooper) knows that. He\u2019s being deceptive to the public of North Carolina.\"\nMcCrory\u2019s campaign later called Cooper\u2019s claim \"the lie of the night.\"\nStarting with the basics\nCooper is right about the amount of money. A new law ordered the transfer of $500,000 of disaster relief money to McCrory\u2019s office for \"costs incurred from litigation related to\" HB2.\nCooper said McCrory \"took\" that money, but \"took\" has multiple meanings. One is more active, like \"grabbed. \" The other is more passive, like \"accepted.\" It might also refer to a certain foolish hobbit, but we won\u2019t get into that.\nSo we need to ask if McCrory actively took the money, passively took the money, or both. Let\u2019s start with passive taking. Did McCrory accept the money? Did he object to it?\nVeto power\nCooper\u2019s main argument during the debate was that McCrory didn\u2019t object to the money being moved, since he allowed the bill in question to become law.\n\"The governor could\u2019ve vetoed this legislation that took this $500,000 out of the Disaster Relief Fund, but he did not,\" Cooper said. \"He did not veto it.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe money came to McCrory on July 1 in a bill making multiple changes and corrections to the state budget. McCrory said he didn\u2019t veto the bill because he didn\u2019t want to risk stopping other important changes if his veto succeeded.\nBut that excuse doesn\u2019t hold water. The legislature could\u2019ve easily overridden his veto, which requires a 60-percent majority to do. This bill received 46 of 50 votes in the Senate (92 percent) and 89 of 120 votes in the House (74 percent).\nMcCrory has issued six vetoes as governor, four of which have been overridden. His latest came less than a month before this budget bill. At the time, he said it would probably be overridden but \"part of the reason to veto a bill is to make sure the public is aware of exactly what\u2019s in a bill.\"\nAnd less than a week before the funding bill came to his desk, he threatened to veto another bill over several parts that he didn\u2019t like; the legislature rewrote those parts in response.\nHowever, after McCrory let the funding bill become law, he did almost immediately say he had no intention of actually using the money \u2013 a statement he repeated again at the debate.\nShow me the money\nSo McCrory accepted the money with no strong formal objections, like a veto.\nWe also know that McCrory asked for $500,000 to be set aside for lawyers for HB2 \u2013 that it wasn\u2019t just imposed on him by the legislature.\nBut both McCrory\u2019s general counsel, Bob Stephens, and the office of Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Berger have said McCrory just asked for the money in general and never specifically suggested pulling it from disaster relief funds \u2013 so the legislature bears responsibility for that choice.\nBut where\u2019s the money now? The budget changes say that the $500,000 from the disaster relief fund \"shall be transferred to the Governor's Office\" for HB2\u2019s legal costs.\nHowever, Berger\u2019s office told us the money has yet to actually be transferred, despite the apparently authoritative wording of the law.\n\"As a practical matter, $500,000 has not been moved from the disaster relief fund,\" said Berger spokeswoman Shelly Carver. She added: \"Further, the governor has said he will not spend any disaster relief funds on legal expenses, which is within his discretion.\"\nBut similarly, McCrory also has the discretion to move the money in the future if he wants.\nAnd what\u2019s less clear is whether the money could still move even against his wishes, since the law says the funds \"shall transfer\" to his office.\nThe word \"shall\" is tricky in legal writing and we simply don\u2019t know exactly how it might be interpreted here. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote in 1995 that \"though shall generally means must, legal writers sometimes use, or misuse, shall to mean should, will or even may.\"\nOur ruling\nCooper said \"Governor McCrory took $500,000 directly out of the disaster relief fund\" to spend on lawyers to defend the controversial HB2 legislation.\nMcCrory did ask for the money, although there\u2019s no proof he asked for it to be taken specifically from disaster relief \u2013 an especially touchy topic now with so much flooding ravaging the state.\nThe money is still in the disaster relief fund, which is a mark against Cooper\u2019s claim, but nevertheless it is still earmarked for HB2, meaning McCrory could take it in the future. And although he has said he won\u2019t, he also didn\u2019t attempt to stop the money from being moved out of disaster relief by using his veto power.\nCooper\u2019s claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/efeebeee-92f2-47c8-8826-dab5f32e372e", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04109"}
