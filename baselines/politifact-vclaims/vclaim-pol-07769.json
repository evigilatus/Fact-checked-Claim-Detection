Scott Walker responds to critics of his cuts to education funding by pointing out signs of progress in the state\u2019s elementary and high schools.\nState residents look at results, Walker says.\n\"For all the hype and hysteria about education, they look at the fact that graduation and third-grade reading scores are up in the state since I took office,\" he told WISN-AM (1130) talk host Jay Weber on April 16, 2014. \"ACT scores continue to be some of the best in the country.\"\nWisconsin students\u2019 longstanding high-achievement scores on the ACT college-readiness exams (second nationally) are well known.\nBut we were interested in what has been happening on the other two measures the governor cited.\nWhen asked for backup, Walker campaign spokeswoman Alleigh Marr\u00e9 said state Department of Public Instruction data proves the governor\u2019s case. And we found it\u2019s the best source of data in both areas.\nFinishing high school\nWisconsin\u2019s statewide public school graduation rate was 85.7 percent in the last full school year (2009-\u201910) before Walker\u2019s term started in January 2010, according to the data. The figure counts those who graduate within four years of starting.\nIn 2010-\u201911, the rate rose to 87 percent. This school year began months before Walker took office, so any policy changes would have had negligible effect on graduation rates.\nThe results since then:\n2011-\u201912: 87.5 percent\n2012-\u201913: 88 percent\nThat 88 percent rate was tied for second-best in the country along with Nebraska, Texas and Vermont. Iowa topped the list at 89 percent, DPI reported.\nAt the time Walker spoke on WISN, that 88 percent figure for 2012-\u201913 was not yet public.\nAlso, we should note that pre-2009 data that is comparable is not available. The new data tracks individual students, while the old method used a different methodology.\nUnder any of the scenarios, the arrow is pointing up, though not emphatically.\nReading Scores\nThird-grade readers, the group cited by Walker, are the youngest public-school students to take the annual Wisconsin Knowledge and Concepts Examinations.\nState officials typically measure progress, or lack thereof, on reading by calculating the number of students deemed \"proficient\" or \"advanced\" based on the exams.\nThe recent history of that figure for third-graders follows a pattern of one-year improvement followed by one-year decline.\n2005-06: 32.8 percent proficient or advanced\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2006-\u201907: 34.4 percent\n2007-\u201908: 33.9 percent\n2008-\u201909: 35.2 percent\n2009-\u201910: 32.7 percent (last full school year before Walker\u2019s election)\n2010-\u201911: 34.2 percent\n2011-\u201912: 33.1 percent\n2012-\u201913: 34.9 percent\n2013-\u201914: 34.6 percent\nSo the figure has ping-ponged between about 33 percent and 35 percent. The current figure is higher than most going back nearly a decade, but lower than two of the years.\nIt hasn\u2019t been a straight line upward in Walker\u2019s time, the figures show.\nStill, the latest year\u2019s count is \"up\" compared to the baseline year pre-Walker. It\u2019s up just slightly compared with 2010-\u201911, and more significantly compared with 2009-\u201910, depending on which is used as the baseline for Walker\u2019s term.\nPublic schools, of course, are not the only\u00a0ones receiving state education aid. Under the voucher or \"choice\" program, private schools in certain districts, most notably Milwaukee, benefit from publicly funded vouchers. We concentrated in this item on public schools because Walker\u2019s comments were in the context of responding to criticism of his public-school funding moves.\nBut for the record, third-grade reading scores also have improved in the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program since 2010.\nDid the governor cherry-pick third-graders because they did better?\nNot really. Reading scores were up as a whole for students in grades 3-8 and grade 10 who take the test.\nWalker has made third-grade learning a focal point of his educational platform, and DPI official John Johnson told us that \"third-grade reading and eighth-grade mathematics assessments are often pointed to as predictors of future academic success or struggles.\"\nFinally, there\u2019s the issue of credit.\nWalker doesn\u2019t directly credit his own policies as responsible for the positive trends. He cited the numbers as part of litany of positive things around the state while discussing voter attitudes.\nBut implicit in Walker\u2019s statement is some degree of chest-thumping, of course. He\u2019s a candidate seeking re-election, after all.\nHe and his critics no doubt would disagree on his impact on these statistics. But it\u2019s clear that longer-term trends are at play here on the shorter time frame Walker cites.\nOur rating\nWalker said, \"Graduation and third grade reading scores are up in the state since I took office.\"\nThe numbers, in both cases, are up compared with the year before he took office, though the reading scores bounced around some.\nSome credit may be due prior elected officials, though, because the trend lines haven\u2019t really changed much going back deeper into the pre-Walker era.\nWe rate his statement Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07769"}
