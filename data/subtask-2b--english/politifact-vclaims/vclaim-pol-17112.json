Gene Wu, D-Houston, said Republicans should support the expansion of mail-in voting because of the demographics of the party\u2019s supporters.\n\"In Texas, vote-by-mail overwhelmingly benefits Republicans,\" Wu said. \"The average age of the Republican voter is like 20 years older than the average Democrat. It is a lot. Their average age is like 65, or something crazy high like that.\"\nIn Texas, state law allows people who meet certain criteria to apply to vote through the mail, which includes any person over 65 years old.\nSo, is Wu\u2019s comparison accurate? Is the average Republican voter in Texas really 20 years older than the average Democratic voter?\nWu said he was aware of reporting to this effect, but did not have a source for the specific statistic he shared during the interview.\nLooking to the voter rolls\nIn Texas, voters do not register with political parties and they are not required to have any affiliation with a party to participate in that group\u2019s primary election.\nTo check Wu\u2019s statement about the average age of voters in each party, we turned to voter registration data available from the Texas Secretary of State\u2019s office and different polls of likely voters in the state.\nDerek Ryan, a voter data specialist and\u00a0 the former research director for the Republican Party of Texas, maintains a list of registered voters and, at PolitiFact Texas\u2019 request, analyzed the ages of people who voted during this year\u2019s Republican primary and Democratic primary.\n\"Based on this data, the average age of people who voted in the 2020 Republican primary election was 59.2 years old,\" he said. \"The average age of people who voted in the 2020 Democratic primary election was 51.6 years old.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2018, Ryan found that people who voted in the Republican primary averaged 60.1 years of age and Democratic primary voters had an average age of 54.5.\nBased on those figures, the average Republican voter was about 7.6 years older than the average Democratic voter in 2020 and about 5.6 years older in 2018.\nRyan did note that, while primary election data is the best way to identify Republican and Democratic voters, people who go to the polls in primaries tend to be older across the board compared with people who vote in general elections.\n\"But the Democrats appear to be doing a better job at getting younger voters to participate in their primary (Beto in 2018 and a competitive presidential primary in 2020 probably helped),\" he said in an email. \"I went back to the 2012 election cycle and the average age of a Democratic primary voter that year was 57 while the average age of a Republican primary voter was 59.\"\nBrandon Rottinghaus, a political science professor at the University of Houston, conducted an analysis using polling data on political ideologies in the state. Both surveys he cited are representative of the state\u2019s general population and do not reflect just those individuals who actually voted, the population Wu specified in his statement.\nUsing Harvard University\u2019s Cooperative Congressional Election Study, a national survey with state-level data, Rottinghaus said the average age of people who identified as Republicans in Texas in 2018 was 52 and the average age of people who said they were Democrats was 46 \u2014 a 6-year age difference.\nIn 2016, the average age of Republicans was 54 and the average Democrat was 49. That\u2019s a gap of 5 years.\nPolling from Univision in partnership with the University of Houston showed a similar trend \u2014 although people were asked to identify their ideology, not a political party.\nIn 2018, Rottinghaus said respondents who said they were conservative or very conservative had an average age of 57, while those who said they were liberal or very liberal had an average age of 41 \u2014 16-year age gap.\nIn 2016, conservative or very conservative respondents had an average age of 57, and liberal or very liberal respondents had an average age of 47 \u2014 a 10 year difference.\nOur ruling\nWu said that in Texas, the \"average age of the Republican voter is like 20 years older than the average Democrat.\"\nThe most recent voter data shows that the average Republican voter was older than the average Democrat, but the age difference was far less pronounced than Wu\u2019s statement, for which he did not have supporting evidence.\nThe average Republican voter in Texas was younger than Wu said and the average Democrat was older.\nWe rate this claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17112"}
