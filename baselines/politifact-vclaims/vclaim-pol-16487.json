It's a number that has been used in so many descriptions of suffering fans (\"86 years of despair and disappointment\" . . . \"86-year drought\" . . . \"86 long and depressing years\") that it's iconic.\n\nDo a Google search on the phrase \"86 years,\" as we did, and five of the first 10 listings relate to the Red Sox.\n\nBut when Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts and a self-described \"true-suffering fan\" of the Sox, spoke about his team at the CNN/YouTube debate on Nov. 28, 2007, he used a different number:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.
