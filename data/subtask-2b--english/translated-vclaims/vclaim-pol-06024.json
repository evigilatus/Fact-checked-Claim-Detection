For example, Trump said that hedge fund managers -- some billionaires count as friends -- don't pay enough taxes. He also refused to impose a flat tax, an idea supported by some Republicans, challenging the importance of gradualism in tax law. Trump said \"while you make a certain amount of money, I think you should graduate higher\" in tax rates. Then he turned the gear again, explaining a more traditional republican argument in favour of tax reduction. \"Look, we are the most tax nation in the world -- and that's why taxes have to go down, businesses have to go back, jobs have to go back.\" We asked a reader if the United States was the \"high-tax nation in the world,\" so we decided to check it out. The press office in Trump did not respond to any inquiry. It should be noted that a more specific claim would have been highly accurate. We have often given a correct estimate of the claim that the United States has the highest tax rate of companies in the world. \u2022 (The legal rate of corporate taxes is the highest in the world, but large-scale reductions and exceptions tend to lower the actual rate below the comparable level of other countries). But Trump's comment does not mention the corporate tax rate, and it seems to discuss general tax rates when he said that the United States is the \"highest tax nation in the world.\" When we asked tax experts about the best criterion for comparing different countries, they referred to two possible criteria. One is tax revenue as a percentage of GDP. The other is the tax income per capita. These measures are calculated by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), a group of 34 developed industrialized States. We found that for both measurements, many United States industrial counterparts had higher tax levels in 2013, the latest year for which data were available. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" On January 11, 2021, taxes accounted for about 25% of GDP in the United States -- but if this seems too much, it was only enough to put the United States in 27th place out of the 30 countries that studied. The five countries with the highest ratios were Denmark, France, Belgium, Finland and Sweden, each accounting for more than 42 per cent of GDP. Only South Korea, Chile and Mexico have lower tax levels for both GDP than the United States. In looking at per capita tax revenues, the United States is somewhat higher, but still far from the top. The total per capita tax in the United States was $13,482, according to OECD data. This position ranks 16th out of 29 countries for which data are available for 2013. The five countries with the highest per capita amounts were Luxembourg, Norway, Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland, ranging from $23,000 to $48,000. Eleven countries, including Chile, Hungary and Turkey, the three lowest on the list, accounted for less than $10,000 per capita. While the comparison of the United States with other developed industrialized countries is highly logical, there is an additional data source that includes the full list of countries - the World Bank. In the World Bank &apos; s comparison of 115 countries in 2012, the United States ranked 12th of the base in taxes as a percentage of GDP. Among the low percentage countries were two members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) (Japan and Spain), some rich oil-producing countries (Kuwait and Oman) and a handful of very poor countries (including Afghanistan and the Central African Republic). To sum up: Trump is wrong by all the data sets we've looked at. The Governor Trump said that the United States is the \"most tax nation in the world.\" According to its measurement, the United States is either in the middle of the group or at the lower end of taxes when compared with other advanced industrialized countries. We assess his claim is wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06024"}
