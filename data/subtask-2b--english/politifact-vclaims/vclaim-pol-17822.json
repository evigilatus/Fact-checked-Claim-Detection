A new post targets the National Football League.\n\"Yesterday, the NFL agreed to give the domestic terror group, BLM, 250 million dollars,\" the July 21 post says. \"NOW, WILL YOU BOYCOTT?\"\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

It doesn\u2019t mention Black Lives Matter.\nNFL Commissioner Roger Goodell recently said \"Black lives matter\" in a video outlining the league\u2019s position, and the league has condemned racism, according to a story in the Undefeated. This new pledge expands on a deal with Players Coalition, a group that negotiated with owners on behalf of players who kneeled during the national anthem to protest police brutality, the story says. Since that agreement more than two seasons ago, the NFL has donated $44 million to fund social justice work by awarding grants to 20 organizations and 350 grassroots programs.\n\"Now that fund will balloon to $250 million in all,\" according to a story on the NFL\u2019s website, \"with the league working with players to identify and work with programs that address criminal justice reform, police reform and economic and educational advancement for African Americans.\"\nNo programs have been announced, so the NFL could decide to donate some of that money to the Black Lives Matter Foundation. But a spokesperson for the league told fact-checkers at the Dispatch that it\u2019s not accurate that all $250 million would be funneled there.\u00a0\nWe rate this Facebook post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17822"}
