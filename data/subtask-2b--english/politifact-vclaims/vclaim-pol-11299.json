The video culminates with these claims, which appear in red letters: \"6.4 million more Americans living in poverty under President Obama\" and \"over 90 rounds of golf.\"\n\nWe\u2019ve already checked the sporty part of that claim, rating as True the statement that Obama has played more than 90 rounds of golf since he became president. Here, we\u2019ll focus on Dewhurst\u2019s claim that the ranks of the poor have grown by 6.4 million.\n\nAs backup, Dewhurst\u2019s campaign sent us a January 2012 editorial from the conservative Washington Examiner that says \"there are 6.4 million more Americans in poverty today than when Obama took office.\"\n\nDewhurst\u2019s campaign also pointed us to a page from the website of the Senate Republican Conference, which consists of Republican members of the U.S. Senate. The page \u2014 dated April 2, 2012, and titled \"He\u2019s Made it Worse: The Obama Economic Record\" \u2014 is presented as a comparison of conditions when Obama became president and \"today\" according to statistics such as the unemployment rate and the size of the federal debt.\n\nUnder \"Americans in Poverty,\" the page says there were 39.8 million on Obama\u2019s inauguration day (Jan. 20, 2009) and are 46.2 million \"today.\" The difference: 6.4 million people.\n\nThe page does not give a source for the poverty numbers, so we turned to the U.S. Census Bureau, which is the official federal source of poverty statistics. The bureau uses a measure of poverty called the \"poverty thresholds\" to help determine the number of U.S. residents living in poverty. If a family has an income below the relevant threshold, then the members of that family are considered to be living in poverty.\n\nThe bureau\u2019s thresholds, which are adjusted annually for inflation, vary by family size. For example, the preliminary figures for 2011, which are the most recent thresholds, show that a family of four people would be considered to be living in poverty if it earned less than $23,018 through the year. Alternatively, the 2011 threshold for single people younger than 65 is $11,702.\n\nThe bureau\u2019s thresholds are different from the poverty guidelines overseen by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which are used to determine if applicants are eligible for government assistance programs.\n\nCensus Bureau spokesman Robert Bernstein told us that the bureau estimates the number of U.S. residents living in poverty on an annual basis. The figure is based on a survey of a scientifically selected sample of about 100,000 households that takes place between February and April each year.\n\nThe survey asks respondents their income for the previous year. And from the survey results, the bureau extrapolates the number of U.S. residents that were living in poverty that year.\n\nThe 2010 poverty statistics were released in September 2011. The next estimate of the number of U.S. residents living in poverty, for 2011, is scheduled for release in September 2012.\n\nWe should note that there have long been concerns about the bureau\u2019s measure, which determines a person or family\u2019s poverty status based on before-tax cash income. One of the primary identified weaknesses with this method is that it does not take into account government policies or benefits that can shrink a family\u2019s income (such as payroll taxes) or enhance it (such as food stamps). Another criticism: The thresholds are not adjusted to account for variations in the cost of living in different places.\n\nWe checked the bureau\u2019s poverty figures to compare with the Senate Republican Conference\u2019s data and found that the group was comparing the number of Americans in poverty in 2008 to the number in 2010. In other words, the Senate group used the bureau\u2019s 2008 statistic \u2014 39.8 million \u2014 for the number of people in poverty on Obama\u2019s inauguration day in January 2009. And it used the 2010 statistic \u2014 46.2 million, the most recent \u2014 for its count of poor Americans in April 2012.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bureau data show that the estimated number of U.S. residents in poverty in 2010, Obama\u2019s second year in office, was greater by 6.4 million than it was in 2008, George W. Bush\u2019s final full year in office. The largest increase came in 2009, Obama\u2019s first year in office, when the poverty total was 3.8 million higher than the year before. In 2010, the number was 2.6 million greater than the 2009 level.\n\nThe 46.2 million residents in poverty in 2010 amounted to the greatest number of Americans in the low-income category since the government started tracking the statistic in 1959.\n\nBut the recent increase did not start on Obama\u2019s watch. The number of Americans living in poverty, by the bureau\u2019s measure, first creeped up in 2007, when 800,000 more people were in poverty than the year before. The subsequent 2008 increase: 2.5 million people.\n\nIn fact, during Bush\u2019s eight years as president, the estimated number of Americans in poverty rose every year but two. We applied the Dewhurst campaign\u2019s methodology to the Bush years, comparing the number of people in poverty the year before Bush took office (2000) with the number during his last full year in office (2008). We found an increase of 8.2 million people.\n\nIn making such comparisons, though, there is another, better way to judge change.\n\nAs PolitiFact noted in a previous fact-check, because of population growth, it\u2019s important to notice shifts in the share of all residents in poverty. And during the years Dewhurst focused on, the portion of U.S. residents in poverty increased, although like the estimated number of people in poverty, the climb began in 2007. The figures:\n\n** 2006: 12.3 percent\n** 2007: 12.5 percent (0.2 percentage point increase)\n** 2008: 13.2 percent (0.7 percentage point increase)\n** 2009: 14.3 percent (1.1 percentage point increase)\n** 2010: 15.1 percent (0.8 percentage point increase)\n\nThe 2010 poverty rate of 15.1 percent was higher than that of every year for more than four decades, save two \u2014 1983, when the rate was 15.2 percent, and 1993, when it was the same as the 2010 figure, 15.1 percent.\n\nA September 2011 New York Times news article about the 2010 poverty statistics said economists pointed to joblessness associated with the 2008 financial collapse and subsequent recession as the main factor pushing more Americans into poverty.\n\nA final note: Dewhurst implies that Obama is to blame for the rising number of people in poverty.\n\nBut our sense is that it\u2019s unfair to place all the responsibility in the president\u2019s lap. The economic downturn began before Obama took office. Also, poverty experts such as Sheldon Danziger, director of the National Poverty Center at the University of Michigan, say that more Americans would have been forced into poverty without the 2009 federal stimulus plan, championed by Obama, which included billions of dollars for programs that help low-income Americans such as Medicaid and unemployment insurance. More broadly, no single official controls the number of Americans living in poverty.\n\nOur ruling\n\nDewhurst\u2019s figures draw from a reliable source on Americans in poverty in 2010 \u2014 which, of course, is not 2012 \u2014 compared with 2008, the year before Obama became president.\n\nA better understanding of the extent of U.S. poverty lies in looking at the share of Americans in dire straits. That measure also supports Dewhurst\u2019s point \u2014 that poverty has increased during Obama\u2019s term. Then again, the percentage of residents in poverty had begun to grow in 2007, two years before Obama\u2019s first in office.\n\nFinally, it\u2019s a reach to say Obama is personally to blame for the increase in poverty.\n\nOn balance, we rate Dewhurst\u2019s statement Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11299"}
