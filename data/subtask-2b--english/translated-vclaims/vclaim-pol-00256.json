Dan Patrick discussed the attack and possible drivers. He referred to mental health and violent video games during the interview. It also raised concerns about spiritual values. Patrick said: \"On Sunday, everyone was going to church in America, praying about it, and the next day when their children went to school, they were not allowed to pray or raise it.\" He made a similar comment as he appeared on Fox News the day after the shooting: \"Look at this Sunday morning when most of your viewers, half of the country's population, are preparing to go to church, yet tomorrow, we will not allow our children to pray even in our schools.\" Patrick's claim is outside the base. Children are allowed to pray in schools and are allowed to discuss current events - including mass shootings. Patrick made a statement when asked about his claim: \"I have referred to a wide range of factors that contribute to domestic terrorism, including waving at our culture that raises hatred and reduces the value of life,\" Patrick said. \"With regard to prayer in our public schools, we have a minute of silence for students to do what they want, but there was a time when students were praying together loudly and students were not prosecuted or prevented from praying in promotional gatherings and graduation. There was a time when the mayor of the city never sued the priests for their speeches, and when journalists like you would never challenge the idea that the issue of faith in America was important. We were a better country when everyone acknowledged that we were all responding to a higher authority and not a government. Many of us in America still believe that.\" Does most Americans go to church? First of all, in both interviews Patrick suggested either \"all\" or \"half the country\" went to church on Sunday to pray after shooting at El Paso. There is no way to ascertain how many people throughout the country have attended religious service on a given day, but there has been a vote on American customs when it comes to religion that can offer some insight here. In 2017, about 39 per cent of Americans attended religious services at least once a week, according to the Pew Research Centre. About 33 per cent attended a few times a month or a year. Some of these people were attending services in mosques, temples and other places of assembly other than churches. A Gallup survey also looked at this trend: in 2018, 22 per cent of Americans attended church or church every week and 10 per cent attended almost every week. Students are allowed to pray to Patrick and say that Texas children are not allowed to pray when they go to class the day after the shooting in El Paso. Patrick probably wasn't talking about a specific example of a school that prevented a child from praying. First, most schools in Texas were still on summer vacation when they filed their claim. In one interview on January 31, 2021, John Kerry said that Hurricane Harvey \"more water fell in Houston in five days than he went over Niagara Falls in one year.\" However, the decision does not prohibit prayer or religious expression at school. \"In the context of the popular myth, the Supreme Court has never criminalized the \"school sanctuary,\" reading a written article from the Freedom Forum Institute. \"Students are free to pray alone or in groups, as long as such prayers do not prejudice the rights of others.\" At the same time, students do not have the \"right to be heard by the captive audience\" and cannot pressure other students to join them in prayer, as the Institute has said. In Texas, state law provides that school boards must require all schools in the province to provide a minute of silence on each campus. During this period, students are allowed \"in contrast to prayer, meditation, or to engage in any other silent activity.\" The same restrictions on prayer and religious expression do not apply to private schools. The discussion of Patrick's shooting also said that students would not be able to discuss the shooting in El Paso during school. The basis for his claim is unclear. There is no policy at the State level that dictates whether teachers can facilitate discussion of the events taking place in the classroom. Furthermore, students are allowed to discuss these issues among themselves or in individual conversations with teachers or school counsellors. School counsellors play countless roles, including as a soundboard for students wishing to vent on their home life and as a resource for students with more serious mental health concerns. It can also play a preventive role, help identify students in crisis, and also serve as a resource for students struggling in the aftermath of a mass shooting who want to talk about the event. Earlier this year, government legislators approved a series of laws aimed at increasing school safety after shooting at the Santa Secondary School in Houston, killing eight students and two teachers. A few new laws include a proposal to improve mental health services for students by expanding access to mental health professionals and providing mental health training for teachers and other school professionals. In two interviews, Patrick said that students would not be able to pray after the mass shooting in El Paso. He also said that they would not be able to discuss the shooting at the school. Patrick's claim is inaccurate. School-sponsored prayer is prohibited, but students are allowed to pray individually, and in Texas, during a required moment of silence. There is no state-wide policy that dictates whether teachers can discuss current events with their students, including mass shootings. There are many avenues available to students wishing to discuss these events with school staff. We value this allegation wrong. - The statement is not accurate.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00256"}
