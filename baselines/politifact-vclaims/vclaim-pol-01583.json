Scott Walker didn\u2019t know which opponent he would face in the Nov. 6, 2018 general election, he tweeted this claim:\n\"A number of Democrats running for governor want to cut the prison population by 50%\" and \"that would require the release of thousands of violent felons.\" \u00a0\nOur rating was Half True. There was no evidence to back up the \"require\" part of Walker\u2019s claim, particularly if a 50 percent reduction were done over a period of years, rather than swiftly.\nA new, similar Walker attack \u00a0\u2014 zeroing in on Tony Evers \u00a0\u2014 has a similar problem.\n\n\n\n\nAll our fact checks in the governor\u2019s race.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nThe new claim\nOn Sept. 12, 2018, a month after Evers, the state schools superintendent, emerged from the primary as the Democratic nominee, Walker elevated his attack to a television ad.\nThe governor\u2019s spot begins with a narrator portraying Evers as putting the public at risk, saying he \"failed to remove abusive teachers from our schools.\"\nThen the narrator asserts that Evers \"wants to cut Wisconsin's prison population in half, a dangerous plan that today would mean releasing thousands of violent criminals back into our communities.\"\nWalker\u2019s use of the word today aims to avoid the problem that the word require caused in his previous fact check.\nThat is, a 50 percent reduction \"today\" \u2014 rather than say, over a period of years \u2014 would require the release of thousands of inmates convicted of violent crimes.\nThere are currently about 23,000 inmates, two-thirds of whom have committed a violent offense, according to the state Department of Corrections. That two-thirds portion includes inmates being held for a violent-crime conviction; and it includes\u00a0those who served their time behind bars for that original offense, but were returned to prison for violating conditions of probation or\u00a0extended supervision that was also part of the sentence for the original offense. Violent offenses include crimes such as murder, rape and robbery, as well as crimes such as assault, extortion and hit-and-run with bodily injury.\nBut Evers has not put a time frame on how he would achieve a 50 percent reduction.\nAnd it\u2019s important to keep in mind that releasing half the inmates who are in prison isn\u2019t the only way to cut the prison population in half.\n\n\n\n\nLike us on Facebook.

We will not release violent criminals. We\u2019re not going to get in the gutter with Scott Walker.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in remarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Walker has also made a claim similar to the one in his TV ad in a private telephone poll of voters done by his campaign.)\nTo back the first part of Walker\u2019s claim \u2014 that Evers supports a 50 percent cut -- Walker\u2019s campaign cites an exchange during a July 12, 2018 debate \u00a0between Democrats who were running for governor. A reference was made to the group Milwaukee Inner-City Congregations Allied for Hope.\nModerator: The multi-racial interfaith organization MICAH launched a campaign in 2011 to cut the state prison population by half, from 22,000 to 11,000. It now sits at 23,000. Do you support that original goal, and how would you balance reducing the prison population \u00a0\u2014\nEvers: Absolutely, and that's a goal that\u2019s worth accomplishing \u2026 We have to stop people incarcerating people for non-violent crimes.\nThe Walker campaign argues that Evers\u2019 response means he is committing to a 50 percent reduction over four years because MICAH\u2019s website refers to a campaign in 2011 to get the 50 percent cut by 2015.\nBut neither the question to Evers, nor his response, mentions four years.\nAnd we found no evidence that Evers has committed to any time frame.\nEvers has said Wisconsin should cut parole revocations and expand drug courts as ways of reducing the number of people being sent to prison.\nHe has also said he would consider releasing some inmates early; treating 17-year-olds as juveniles instead of adults for criminal charges; and overhauling truth-in-sentencing so prisoners could be released for good behavior.\n\nKenneth Streit, a clinical professor of law emeritus at the University of Wisconsin Law School, told us it\u2019s possible to achieve a 50 percent cut without releasing inmates convicted of violent crimes \u2014 or at least not thousands of them.\nStreit has studied corrections policy since 1990 and has assisted the Legislature and the Department of Corrections in developing and evaluating adult community corrections programs. He said the population could be reduced by about 5 percent annually over the next decade through steps such as changing sentencing guidelines and tripling funding for treatment-based probation that would reduce the number of people going back to prison for probation revocations. \u00a0\nWhether a 10-year time frame, or longer, would be acceptable to advocates for the 50 percent reduction is unclear; many want a quicker turnaround.\nBut, despite Walker\u2019s claim, it\u2019s also not clear that Evers would seek a 50 percent cut over a period that would force the release of thousands of inmates convicted of violent crimes.\nOne more point before we close:\nRyan King, research director at the nonprofit Justice Policy Institute, who formerly did studies for the Urban Institute and the Pew Research Center, said research shows that people who are in prison for violence are less likely to be rearrested after release than people sentenced for other offenses.\nOur rating\nWalker says Evers \"wants to cut Wisconsin's prison population in half, a dangerous plan that today would mean releasing thousands of violent criminals back into our communities.\"\nEvers has stated that a 50 percent reduction is a goal. But he has not put a time frame on achieving that \u2014 a crucial factor in determining whether inmates of convicted of violent crimes would have to be released.\n\nExperts say a 50 percent reduction over a relatively short period, say a few years, would require the release of inmates convicted of violent crimes. But some say it\u2019s possible to cut the population in half, perhaps over 10 years, without the release of any violent offenders, or at least not thousands of them.\n\nFor a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True.
