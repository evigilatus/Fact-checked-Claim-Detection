In the wake of a press conference held on 8 March in Jupiter City, Michelle Fields, at that time a writer of the conservative site Brittbart, tried to ask Trump a question while he was leaving. Luandovsky allegedly grabbed Fields' arm and pulled it away, leaving bruises. When the news of the incident began to spread, Leondowski in Fields tweeted, saying, \"You're totally delusional. \"I've never touched you\" However, the security footage of the incident published by the Jupiter Police Department on March 29 appears to show Leonandowski's seizure of the fields. Despite the last video, Trump said that Leonandowski did not fake what happened. He said it was the fields that were bluffing. \" (FIELDS) She said she went to Earth, or something of the effect that she almost went to Earth,\" said Trump on March 29th CNN City Hall. \"She was in pain.\" I went to Earth. When I found out there was a security camera, and they put it on tape, that story suddenly changed. She didn't talk about it.\" On Twitter, Trump asked why no one was examining how Fields' story had changed, and Fields replied, \"Because my story never changed. Seriously, just stop lying.\" Did Fields change her story about what happened between her and Luandaski? Doesn't seem like it. We were unable to find an example of her public account of what happened since the second week of March when the story first appeared. Since the security footage became public on March 29, Fields has not yet given an interview. We tried to get to Trump and Fields, and we didn't hear anything. In CNN City Hall, Trump said that Fields' first claim was that it fell on the ground or that it almost fell on the ground. It was the last. \"I've shook back,\" Felds wrote March 10. \"Someone grabbed me hard from his arm and pulled me down.\" I almost fell on the floor, but I was able to keep my balance. However, I was shaken.\" On 13 January 2021, the distinguished fact-finding bloggers announced in a story in which General David H. Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request to use marines for opening security, and told her that \"we are not working for you.\" Therese wrote: \"while the public security difference to give him a passage from a dance hall full of rich women, Fields pressed to ask the first Republican candidate.\" \"I watched as a man with short hair and a suit I grabbed her arm and pulled her out of the way.\" Kuri Luandawski, 41-year-old director of the Trump campaign.\" Immediately, Luandowski and the Trump campaign denied the charge of Fields. \"Indictment, which was done only in the media and not dealt with directly with the campaign, is a completely false accusation,\" said Speaker Hope Hicks in a statement. \"As one of dozens of individuals who came with Mr. Trump came out of the press conference, I did not see a meeting. In addition to our staff, who were unaware of the situation in question, not one camera or correspondence was picked up by more than 100 persons present at the alleged incident.\" Felds stood by her account of an interview on March 14, with Megan Kelly from Fox. She said, \"This is a campaign that keeps lying.\" \"I never wanted it to be this way.\" Those bruises will heal. My problem is to distort my name, my reputation.\" In the aftermath of the incident, the editor-in-chief of Brettbart widely published a report by Joel Pollack in which he wondered whether Luandowski had kidnapped Fields instead of another man. He claimed that Britt was standing with the Trump campaign rather than resigning his staff, his field and several other Britts. Since security footage appeared in the last two days, although Pollack admitted that his report was incorrect. Trump, on the contrary, said the footage of Loandaski's innocence completely. It appears from the video that she was arrested - and the police report says that the video is consistent with what Fields claimed. Trump also criticized Fields for thinking he was asking and carrying a pen. Although some expectation was made for the reporter to have a pen in hand, Trump said it could have been a \"small bomb\" or a knife. Our verdict, Trump, said that when Michelle Fields found out there was a security camera, and they put it on tape, that story suddenly changed. We see no evidence that Fields' story of having a fight with Trump's campaign manager has changed. She gave a preliminary account, and she didn't back off. We appreciate Trump's claim for pants on fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05186"}
