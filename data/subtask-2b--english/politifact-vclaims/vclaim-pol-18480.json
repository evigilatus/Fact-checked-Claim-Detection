One of the workers is holding a ballot and the other is filling out a ballot with a pen.\u00a0\n\n\"This lady is marking the ballots,\" says a man narrating the video. \"I filmed her a half hour ago diong six and she\u2019s still working at it. \u2026 And there\u2019s a security guard who\u2019s right there watching her. The cops are in on it! Disgusting.\"\u00a0\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

But it\u2019s cropped so that \"bipartisan poll watchers who were not more than six feet away\" are no longer in the frame, said Adrienne Marofsky, a spokesperson for the county.\u00a0\nThe poll worker in the video is copying information from a damaged ballot the county received onto a blank ballot so that the votes could be counted.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause the county received some ballots that were damaged, they couldn\u2019t be scanned, Marofsky said. The scanner manufacturer has advised that the best solution for damaged ballots that can\u2019t be scanned is to transcribe the votes onto a clean ballot and scan that ballot instead, she said.\u00a0\n\"As ballots were being transcribed, the original damaged ballots were directly beside the new ballots, and bipartisan observers witnessed the process at close range,\" Marofsky said. \"Damaged ballots have been preserved.\"\u00a0\nMarfosky said the county is livestreaming poll workers counting ballots to be transparent about the elections process.\u00a0\n\"Unfortunately,\" she said, \"some residents \u2026 are making false accusations, which baselessly and wrongly attack the integrity of the election staff.\"\u00a0\nWe rate this Facebook post False.\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click here, for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18480"}
