In the second discussion between presidential candidates, Trump Clinton criticized the delivery of more than half of her e-mails on her Foreign Ministry server and the deletion of the rest. He said that Clinton should be ashamed of herself to delete 33,000 e-mails. \"There was no such thing,\" said Trump at the 9th October event in St. Louis. \"You get a subpoena, and after you get a subpoena, you delete 33,000 e-mails.\" Clinton and her campaign do not dispute the deletion of these 33,000 e-mails. They argue that these issues are of a personal nature and not relevant to the work, and therefore did not need to be handed over. However, they denied that they had deleted e-mails after they had received a call from Congress from the Select Committee of the House of Representatives on Benghazi on 4 March 2015. However, the report of the Federal Bureau of Investigation of August 2016 on his investigations shows that Trump &apos; s claim has certain advantages. Let's take a look at the schedule of relevant events, according to the FBI report. (The most important information is available on pages 15 to 19 of this document. February 1, 2013: Clinton serves her last day as Secretary of State. 23 July 2014: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reached an agreement with the Benghazi Committee on the preparation of records to investigate the 2012 attack on an American embassy in the Libyan city. 28 October 2014: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs sends an official letter to Clinton officials requesting \"e-mails concerning their government work.\" Clinton &apos; s attorney, David Kendall, and Cheryl Mills &apos; assistant, supervised the review of Clinton &apos; s e-mail archives to produce work-related documents to the Section. 5 December 2014: The Clinton Group submits 55,000 pages of e-mails to the Department of Foreign Affairs, or about 30,000 individual e-mails. Mills tells a staff member at Platt River, who ran the server, that Clinton does not need to keep any e-mails greater than 60 days. March 2, 2015: The New York Times publishes the story that Clinton used a personal e-mail account while he was the Secretary of State. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" By Samantha Butterman (January 11, 2021 - March 4, 2015): The Benghazi Committee issues a subpoena requesting Clinton to deliver all e-mails from its own server related to the incident in Libya. Between 25-31 March 2015: Plat River Network employee has what he calls \"Oh--\" a moment, aware that he did not delete Clinton's e-mail archive, at Mills' request in December 2014. The staff member deletes the e-mail archive using a program called Plaich Pitt. :: March 27, 2015: Clinton &apos; s lawyers send a letter to the Benghazi Commission stating that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs already has the relevant e-mails, as contained in letter No. 5 of December 2014. The Trump timetable is correct. The Congressional summons came on March 4, 2015, and an employee deleted e-mails sometime after March 25, 2015, three weeks later. However, the implication - that Clinton has deleted e-mails related to the summons in order to avoid scrutiny - cannot be proved if it is not a serious mistake. The FBI investigation found several thousand e-mails among those that had been deleted that were work-related and should have been delivered to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. However, in the July 2016 statement, FBI Director James Come said that the FBI investigation \"did not find any evidence that any of the additional work-related e-mails were deliberately deleted in an attempt to hide those messages.\" At a subsequent congressional hearing, Komi added that the FBI had not specifically informed one of Clinton's employees that he had asked the employee to delete e-mails after the New York Times story and call in the audience. Instead, this decision was made by the staff member himself. (Clinton) told the FBI that she was not involved in deciding whether individual e-mails should be sent to the State Department, or \"didn't anyone order the deletion of her e-mails to avoid compliance with FBI or state requests for information.\" Our Governor Trump said, \"You (Hillary Clinton) get a subpoena, and after getting a subpoena you delete 33,000 e-mails.\" Clinton staff received a call for e-mails concerning Benghazi on 4 March. Three weeks later, an employee managing her server was deleted from Clinton's e-mails. The FBI found no evidence that the e-mails were intentionally deleted to avoid the summons or other requests. The Clinton team requested that e-mails be deleted months before the summons arrived. They also argued that all e-mails that might be relevant to the summons had already been handed over to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. We're assessing Trump's claim of half the integrity. They shared political realities 3-7 policy assessment: half true: \"You (Hillary Clinton) get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena, you delete 33,000 e-mails.\" :: Donald Trump, presidential candidate for the second presidential debate in 2016, Sunday, 9 October 2016 10/09/2016", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04171"}
