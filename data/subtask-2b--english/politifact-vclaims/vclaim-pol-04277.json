PolitiFact National\u2019s rating was True, as multiple polls generally showed support in the low 50s.\nIt seems unlikely that in a few short weeks it would jump to 60 percent.\nBut let\u2019s take a look.\nPrevious factcheck\nWhen Johnson made his earlier claim, our colleagues found that in 12 of 14 national polls taken since the start of 2014, 50 percent or more of Americans supported legalization. The information, covering a period of more than 2.5 years, was taken from the PollingReport.com database\nAs for the other two polls, legalization led in one by 48 percent to 47 percent and in the other by 49 percent to 48 percent.\nIn the three latest polls in the database, the numbers crept closer to 60 percent, with support at 54 percent, 56 percent and 58 percent.\nBut averaging the 14 polls, legalization led 53 percent to 44 percent.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Steineke\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembly Republicans \u201chave come to the table\u201d and were part of \u201cgive and take\u201d compromise on a coronavirus bill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother poll\nJohnson\u2019s campaign, however, pointed us to another relatively recent poll that wasn\u2019t included in the database.\nThe Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll, conducted in February 2016, found that 61 percent of Americans said the use of marijuana should be made legal.\n(Interestingly, 53 percent said marijuana use in their communities was a moderately serious, very serious or extremely serious problem, compared to 45 percent who said it was not at all serious or not too serious.)\nReporting on the poll, the Washington Post\u2019s Wonkblog said the 61 percent support, a notch above Johnson\u2019s claim, was an all-time high.\nA parting note, though it doesn\u2019t bear on our rating of Johnson\u2019s claim about national numbers: \u00a0\nIn a July 2016 poll of registered voters in Wisconsin, the Marquette Law School Poll asked:\nWhen it comes to marijuana, some people think that the drug should be fully legalized and regulated like alcohol. Do you agree or disagree with that view?\nThe results: 59 percent agreed, 39 percent disagreed.\n\u00a0\nOur rating\nJohnson said: \"Sixty percent of Americans now support legalizing marijuana.\"\nA March 2016 poll found 61 percent support, but that is the only recent survey we could find showing support that high. Fourteen other polls going back more than two years show a majority of Americans back legalization, but generally support was in the low 50s.\nWe rate Johnson\u2019s statement Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2c688f18-7afd-43e2-926c-6d8b8a1654cd", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04277"}
