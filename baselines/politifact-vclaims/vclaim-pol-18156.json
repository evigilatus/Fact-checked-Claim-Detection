Even at age 79, he is one of the top advisers to President Donald Trump on the coronavirus crisis.\nYet Ron Paul, a sometimes conspiracy-minded Texas doctor, former GOP congressman and former presidential candidate, seemed to raise a fair question about a coronavirus statement made by Fauci.\nCalling Fauci \"the chief fearmonger of the Trump Administration,\" Paul wrote in a column on his website that Fauci \"testified to Congress that the death rate for the coronavirus is 10 times that of the seasonal flu, a claim without any scientific basis.\"\nWe wondered about the scientific basis attack. In some contexts, public health experts have said it\u2019s too early in the coronavirus outbreak to know exactly what it\u2019s death rate is.\nPaul\u2019s post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

(Several factors apply, such as age and health.)\n\n\nA study of 44,672 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in China diagnosed as of Feb. 11, 2020, from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention found a fatality rate of 2.3%. A March 3, 2020, estimate from the World Health Organization put the figure at 3.4%, although that figure is likely inflated given how many cases are mild and not treated in hospitals. Some people who die never report having had coronavirus.\n\n\nThe latest daily report on COVID-19 from the World Health Organization, issued March 16, 2020, said there have been 167,515 confirmed cases and 6,606 deaths. That\u2019s a death rate of 3.9%.\nThe flu death rate is much lower.\nIn its latest weekly report on the 2019-20 flu, for the week ending March 7, 2020, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates there have been 36 million flu illnesses and 22,000 deaths. That\u2019s a rate of 0.06%.\nThe case fatality ratio \u2014 dividing reported deaths by reported cases \u2014 is only a snapshot and the rate can vary considerably during an outbreak, the World Health Organization told us.\n\"We will not have a clear CFR until the outbreak is over,\" WHO said in a statement, adding that the CFR can change if it is discovered that there are many more milder cases than originally thought, and can vary by country based demographic factors, such as age.\u00a0\nWe didn\u2019t hear back from our requests for information from Paul.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nPaul said that Anthony Fauci\u2019s statement that the coronavirus death rate is 10 times that of the seasonal flu is \"a claim without any scientific basis.\"\nWe won\u2019t know for some time what the actual death rate is for people who contract the current coronavirus, COVID-19. But based on figures that are available, it\u2019s indicated to be at least 10 times higher than the death rate from the flu. We rate Paul\u2019s statement False.\nCorrection, March 24, 2020: CDC estimates have indicated\u00a0a COVID-19 death rate of\u00a00.06%, not 0.0006%, as we originally reported.
