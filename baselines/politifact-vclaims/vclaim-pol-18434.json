Anderson III said in a statement.\n\"The person making the statements does not work in any way with Erie County or have any part of Erie County\u2019s election process,\" Anderson wrote, \"In fact, the individual is not a registered voter and is not believed to be a resident of Erie County.\"\nA spokesperson for Erie County confirmed to PolitiFact that the statement was in reference to the Instagram story in question. Other reporters\u00a0and fact-checkers have since noted that the viral Instagram story was a hoax, and that claims about it were inaccurate.\nCoudrey told PolitiFact in a Twitter message that he had seen that the county issued its official statement saying the Instagram user was not a poll worker. He also noted that the county\u2019s statement said authorities are investigating the incident for potential criminal charges.\nOverall, the claim that an Erie County poll worker threw out over 100 ballots for Trump is based on an Instagram story from a person unaffiliated with the county. It has since been debunked.\nWe rate the claim False.\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections\u00a0FactChat\u00a0#Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click\u00a0here, for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18434"}
