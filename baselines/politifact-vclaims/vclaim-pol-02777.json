Ted Cruz, famous and infamous for his 2013 filibuster-like talk-a-thon that included his reading a Dr. Seuss story to his daughters\u00a0watching from home, no longer favors preserving a rule that makes it hard to stop filibusters.\nDid the Texas senator flip-flop? We inquired.\nIn the 100-person Senate, a filibuster (from a Dutch word meaning pirate) can\u2019t be broken unless the senator in the spotlight gives way or foes raise 60 votes to invoke \"cloture,\" bringing debate to a close. Senators set that threshold, which breaks out to a three-fifths majority, in 1975. For decades before, according to a Senate web page, it had taken a two-thirds vote to invoke cloture.\nCruz, a Republican lawyer, said in 2015 he wouldn\u2019t support elimination of the 60-vote hurdle--even to advance his goal of repealing the Obamacare law put in place by Democrats.\nAccording to a Roll Call news story, Cruz initially told Heritage Action\u2019s Jan. 12, 2015, policy summit that Republicans should do \"everything humanly possible to repeal Obamacare.\" But, the story said, Cruz said afterward he believed Senate Republicans, while in the majority, shouldn\u2019t eliminate the filibuster as a tactic to get more legislation to then-President Barack Obama.\n\"No, we should not,\" Cruz said. \"We should preserve the procedural protections in the Senate for the rights of the minority.\" Cruz then borrowed an analogy used by the framers of the Constitution by saying the Senate is \"like the saucer under the tea cup to cool deliberations, and I think those checks and balances were inspired. And one of the ways to limit rash decision-making is the requirement in the Senate of a 60-vote threshold to overcome a filibuster.\"\nIn September 2017, though, according to a Texas Tribune news story, Cruz said at a Texas tea-party forum that he\u2019s changed his mind and now favors an end to the 60-vote threshold to end a filibuster.\nAt the forum, the story says, Cruz was asked whether, like President Donald Trump, he supports ending the filibuster rule. The story said Cruz called for ending the filibuster rule, acknowledging it is an \"issue on which I\u2019ve changed my mind over the last five years.\"\nWe asked Cruz spokesman Phil Novack if Cruz\u2019s position had changed. Yes, Novack replied, pointing us by email to a Facebook-posted video of the Sept. 30, 2017, NE Tarrant Tea Party meeting where Cruz was asked about eliminating the 60-vote threshold.\nAt the meeting, Cruz replied, to applause: \"Long and short out of it, I would end the 60-vote filibuster right now.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin Nunes\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in an interview on Fox\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRepublicans have no way to communicate\u201d after tech companies cut off Parler.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Amy Sherman \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHis answer went on:\n\"Now let me give you some context on that because that\u2019s actually an issue on which I\u2019ve changed my mind over the last five years.\n\"So if you\u2019d asked me five years ago, I would have had a different answer. \u00a0And the reason is as follows: I think over time, the 60-vote threshold for legislation has had a small \u2018c\u2019 conservative effect in that it has slowed down the operation of Congress. Since World War II, we\u2019ve had three Democratic super-majorities: the first gave us the New Deal; the second gave us the Great Society; the third gave us Obamacare and Dodd-Frank.\n\"So, getting rid of the filibuster means any time there\u2019s a Democratic majority, you have a Democratic supermajority. So a lot of bad legislation would pass without the 60-vote threshold. So, if you\u2019d asked me five years ago, I would have said no, I don\u2019t think we should get rid of it because it slows down bad legislation at a time when the Democrats are in control.\n\"Why have I changed my mind? Because I don\u2019t believe Democrats will be bound by it. I ...think the next time the Democrats have a majority, particularly with a Democratic president, I think they\u2019ll end the filibuster in a hurry. So if I believed it were a credible threat, that it actually would restrain Democrats in the future, then I might well support keeping it now. I don\u2019t.\"\nCruz\u2019s reply closed with a comment including a word we couldn\u2019t make out: \"I think it\u2019s stupid that it\u2019s a one-way (unintelligible), that it only limits us, it doesn\u2019t limit them.\"\nOur ruling\nCruz once favored keeping the 60-vote requirement to end a Senate filibuster. He no longer does.\nOn the PolitiFact Flip-O-Meter, that\u2019s a FULL FLOP.\n\nFull Flop A major reversal of position; a complete flip-flop.\n Share the Facts 2017-10-20 21:26:12 UTC   PolitiFact    9 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Full Flop  On preserving 60-vote threshold to end a Senate filibuster.
