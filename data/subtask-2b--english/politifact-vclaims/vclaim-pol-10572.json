The evaluations were part of broader school-reform legislation that passed the General Assembly with bipartisan support in 2010.\n\nThe evaluation standards were enacted as part of Tennessee\u2019s application for the $4 billion federal Race to the Top competition, which provides grants to states in recognition of education innovation and reform. Tennessee was one of the first two states to receive grants under the program.\n\nFifty percent of the new teacher evaluations were required under state law to be based on student achievement data, including student growth on the Tennessee Value-Added Assessment System (TVAAS) or a comparable measure, as well as additional measures of student achievement.\n\nThe other 50 percent of the teacher evaluations were to be determined through \"qualitative measures,\" such a teacher observations, personal conferences and a review of prior evaluations and work.\n\nThe evaluations were controversial from the beginning, especially with the Tennessee Education Association. Teachers argued the evaluations punished them rather than helping them improve. Some teachers complained they don\u2019t teach subjects covered by the state tests, yet they are nonetheless judged on student test scores in those areas.\n\nWe won\u2019t attempt to analyze or fact-check all of the criticisms about the teacher evaluations, although we will note that an education advocacy group tapped by Gov. Bill Haslam to review the system recommended a number of improvements on June 11, 2012.\n\nA month later, the Tennessee Department of Education released its own one-year report on how the implementation has gone. That report also recommended a number of improvements and is the basis for Duncan\u2019s column in The Huffington Post.\n\nFor our purposes, we will stick to fact-checking Duncan\u2019s claim that student achievement experienced its largest gains in the year after the evaluations were implemented.\n\nThe state Department of Education report gives credence to Duncan\u2019s statement.\n\n\"The 2011-12 school year saw tremendous progress for public education in Tennessee, as measured by the most significant outcome \u2013 student achievement,\" the report said. \"Test scores improved, in aggregate, at a faster rate than any previously measured year.\"\n\nMath and science test scores, in particular, increased significantly, the report noted.\n\n\"To put this in perspective,\" the report said, \"55,000 more students are at or above grade level in math than in 2010; 38,000 more students are at or above grade level in science.\"\n\nThere is a caveat, however. In measuring student achievement, the state Education Department tracked the aggregate gains on statewide testing only as far back as 2007, said Kate Shellnutt, a spokeswoman for the department.\n\nThat\u2019s because the state now reports scores for grades 3-8 and high school subjects. Prior to 2007, the state reported scores for grades K-8 and high school. Comparing test scores now to anything prior to 2007 would not have been an apples-to-apples comparison. Also worth noting -- beginning in 2010, the tests for every subject and grade level became much more rigorous.\n\nRegardless, the growth and achievement over the past year \"represents real change in the academic trajectory and potential life options for Tennessee students and can be the very real difference between long-term success and failure,\" the Education Department report said.\n\nThe report attributed the strong academic performance to a number of factors, including higher academic standards; an accountability framework that recognizes ambitious but achievable goals; stronger professional development offerings funded in many cases through districts\u2019 Race to the Top plans; and continued state financial investment in K-12 education despite a challenging budget climate.\n\n\"We also believe teacher evaluation has played an important role in our student achievement gains as administrators have specifically cited its role in improving instruction,\" the report said.\n\nOur ruling\n\nWhile the new teacher evaluation system continues to be controversial, the state Department of Education report says it is at least partly responsible for the academic gains Tennessee students have made over the past year. During that period, student test scores approved, in aggregate, at a faster rate than any year since 2007, the most recent year in which comparable data is available.\n\nIn his column, Secretary Duncan left out a couple of qualifiers about the student achievement \u2013 namely, that the teacher evaluations are partly but not solely responsible for the student improvement, and that comparable data on student achievement is available only back as far as 2007. Still, his larger point \u2013 that Tennessee students have made historic academic gains in the past year \u2013 is backed up by the state report. Thus, we rate his claim as Mostly True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10572"}
