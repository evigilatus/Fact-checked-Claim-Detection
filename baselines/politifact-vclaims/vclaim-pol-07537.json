Where's there's bipartisan support is to get Europe to take stronger stand.\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said on CNN\u2019s State of the Union Sunday that President Barack Obama should be getting the European Union nations into line.\n\"They\u2019re dysfunctional political organization, Europe is,\" Graham said. \"And without American leadership organizing Europe and the world, you see people like (Russian President Vladimir) Putin, who has an economy the size of Italy -- he\u2019s playing a poker game with a pair of 2s and winning.\"\nReally? Russia is the world\u2019s\u00a0second-largest producer of natural gas and the third-largest producer of oil, and it has an economy the size of Italy?\nTurns out they largely do.\nThe numbers\nRussia and Italy are very close to each other in terms of nominal gross domestic product, which is the standard unit used to measure the size of a country\u2019s economy. Nominal GDP is the total cost of all goods and services produced or sold in a country in within a certain time frame.\nRussia\u2019s 2013 nominal GDP was $2.1 trillion, and Italy\u2019s was $2.07 trillion, according to the World Bank.\nThat\u2019s not the only way to measure a country\u2019s economy, of course, and this is where the two countries differ. Purchasing power parity takes nominal GDP a step further and shows the value of this level of economic activity if it took place in America. (The Economist explains it by showing how much a McDonald\u2019s Big Mac costs around the world.)\nRussia\u2019s GDP calculated for purchasing power parity was $3.5 trillion, while Italy\u2019s was $2.1 trillion. So in 2013, Russia had a higher level of economic activity than Italy, but because goods and services are more expensive in Italy, the overall value (nominal GDP) ended up the same.\nAlso, Italy has more wealth relative to the size of its population than Russia does. Italy\u2019s 2013 GDP per capita (per person) was $34,619, and Russia\u2019s was $14,612.\nBut nominal GDP is the standard way to measure an economy\u2019s size compared to other nations, and Graham got that right.\nRussia\u2019s influence\nThough Russia may have an economy the size of Italy\u2019s, that hardly means it's too small to throw its weight around.\nRussia ranks eighth among the world\u2019s top 10 economies, based on 2013 nominal GDP:\n\n\nUnited States -- $16.8 trillion;\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChina -- $9.2 trillion;\n\n\nJapan -- $4.9 trillion;\n\n\nGermany -- $3.6 trillion;\n\n\nFrance -- $2.7 trillion;\n\n\nUnited Kingdom -- $2.5 trillion;\n\n\nBrazil -- $2.2 trillion;\n\n\nRussia -- $2.1 trillion;\n\n\nItaly -- $2.1 trillion;\n\n\nIndia -- $1.9 trillion.\n\n\nAlso of note: the European Union\u2019s 2013 nominal GDP was $17.4 trillion.\nGraham compared Russia\u2019s economy to Italy\u2019s to show how small it is -- but Italy\u2019s economy isn\u2019t that small compared to the rest of the world, so neither is Russia\u2019s. In terms of level of economic activity -- purchasing power parity -- Russia is No. 6 in the world.\nIn fact, their spot on the list today is close to what it was in the last couple years of the Cold War (the earliest data the World Bank has on Russia\u2019s GDP). In 1992, the year the Soviet Union officially dismantled, their nominal GDP was ranked ninth in the world (America was No. 1). The Russians were also ninth in 1991 and 1990, and they were eighth in 1989. \u00a0\u00a0\nRussia\u2019s economic standing among other countries has been on the rise in recent years. Only in 2008, 2011, 2012 and 2013 has Russia\u2019s nominal GDP been in the top 10.\nOne likely reason for their growth is rising oil prices, which have quadrupled since 2002. Oil and natural gas make up nearly 70 percent of Russia\u2019s exports. (Though this isn\u2019t to say the rest of Russia\u2019s economy is thriving.)\nAlthough some say Russia\u2019s overwhelming dependence on oil won\u2019t sustain them for long, Russia has used this natural resource to gain leverage\u00a0in the Ukrainian conflict -- such as cutting off a major gas supply to Ukraine. And the origins of the conflict lie in whether Ukraine should strengthen its ties with Russia or the European Union -- proving that Russia still exerts a strong influence over some countries\u2019 economic activity.\nOur ruling\nGraham said Russia \"has an economy the size of Italy.\"\nIn terms of nominal GDP, Graham is correct. But if you run\u00a0the numbers a different way and measure purchasing power parity, Russia's economy is larger than Italy's.\nGraham's statement is accurate but needs additional information.\u00a0We rate his claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07537"}
