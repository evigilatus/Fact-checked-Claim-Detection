Dan Bishop has been one of North Carolina\u2019s most vocal opponents of Gov. Roy Cooper\u2019s stay-at-home order.\nBishop, a Republican elected in 2019 to represent southwest NC, has attended protests urging Cooper to \"reopen\" the state\u2019s economy. But in an interview on April 24, the congressman made a comment about the U.S. economy that caught our attention.\nOn Spicer & Co., the show of former White House press secretary Sean Spicer on the conservative Newsmax TV, he said \"half the workforce in the country may have just been idled.\"\nHere are his full comments:\n\"People who are elderly or who have underlying conditions that would subject them to the worst ravages of the coronavirus should take additional measures and, in fact, I don't object to government taking measures to see to it that those people are particularly protected,\" he said.\n\"But it\u2019s quite another step to utterly devastate the economic landscape in a way \u2014 and I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve seen a figure that better summarizes how bad it is, as the suggestion you just put up \u2014 that half the workforce in the country may have just been idled.\"\nIs it true that half of the American workforce has been idled? And what \"figure\" is Bishop referring to?\nAccording to Bishop\u2019s spokeswoman, Hannah Hummelberg, the congressman was referring to a New York Times stat that Spicer mentioned earlier in the segment.\u00a0\n\"The number of unemployment claims filed so far is equal to the total workforce, get this, of 25 states,\" Spicer said. (Spicer\u2019s comment comes around the 1:15 mark of this video, while Bishop makes his claim shortly after the 4:30 mark.)\nClearly, a chunk of the American population has filed for unemployment. But does it add up to half of the U.S. workforce? No.\u00a0\nUnemployment\nBy citing the New York Times stat, Bishop tied his definition of \"idle\" to unemployment numbers. So let\u2019s put the Times\u2019 stat in perspective.\u00a0\nThere were about 160 million workers in the U.S. around the start of the year. That\u2019s according to experts we interviewed, previous PolitiFact reporting, and numbers from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nObviously, 26 million workers \u2014 the New York Times unemployment stat cited by Bishop \u2014 is not half of 160 million. So it\u2019s wrong to suggest half of the U.S. is unemployed.\nAnd it\u2019s not \"statistically sound\" to equate 26 million workers with \"half\" of the country, said Ryan Bourne, the R. Evan Scharf Chair for the Public Understanding of Economics at the Cato Institute. Cato is a think tank that advocates for free markets.\nAnd the New York Times comparison wouldn\u2019t work with just any grouping of 25 states. In California alone, there are 19 million workers.\n\"Since our population is not spread evenly across the states, the working population of 25 states doesn't provide an estimate of 50% of the national workforce,\" said Tara Sinclair, associate professor of economics and international affairs at George Washington University.\nUncounted workers\nThe Times\u2019 stat alone isn\u2019t enough to support Bishop\u2019s claim. So let\u2019s explore other estimates of U.S. unemployment.\nThere are people that unemployment reports don\u2019t account for, such as those who are furloughed or who are working reduced hours.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Kirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDean Baker, co-founder of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, said the number of people who filed for unemployment isn\u2019t complete. He said there are several million more people who either could not get their forms in or were ineligible.\n(In North Carolina, for example, the phone lines at the state\u2019s unemployment office were so busy that many people claimed they couldn\u2019t get through to file claims.)\nBaker thinks the number of unemployed Americans is somewhere between 20-25%, he said in an May 5 email. \"I would be hesitant to use one much higher,\" he said.\nCNN estimated that 43 million workers were either out of work or working reduced hours in April alone.\nPublic surveys\nBourne, the CATO expert, said Bishop\u2019s claim would only be valid if considered very broadly.\u00a0\nHe referenced a poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation that said 55% of workers had either lost jobs, lost pay, lost hours, or been furloughed since Feb. 1.\u00a0\nThe definition of \"idled\" is to not work or not do something. It\u2019s a reference to inaction. The Kaiser survey included people who lost pay, but might still be working.\n\"This, as you can see, highlights the scale of the economic impacts of the virus and response, but is a different claim entirely,\" Bourne said.\nOn April 21, three days before Bishop\u2019s claim, the Pew Research Center published a study on how the coronavirus response affected the wages of American workers.\nAbout 28% said they or someone in their household has been laid off or lost their job. When asked if someone in the house had lost their job or taken a pay cut, 43% said yes.\nGross Domestic Product\nChris Lafakis, a director at Moody\u2019s Analytics, said the workforce can also be judged by the U.S. GDP. GDP measures the total value of goods and services produced in the U.S. over the course of a year.\nIt fell 4.8% in the first three months of the year (the first quarter), according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. The bureau\u2019s second quarter numbers run through June and are not yet available.\nDeutsche Bank expects GDP to drop \"nearly 40%\" in the second quarter, according to Business Insider. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office almost mirrors that estimate, expecting a 39% drop.\n\"Most economists\" don\u2019t expect GDP to dip by 50%, Lafakis said. Moody\u2019s expects GDP to decline 33% at an annualized rate in quarter two.\nOur ruling\nBishop said \"half the workforce in the country may have just been idled.\"\u00a0\nBishop took a stat that\u2019s meant to illustrate the magnitude of unemployment and misused it to falsely say half of the country\u2019s workers are unemployed.\nThe U.S. workforce is roughly 160 million people. We found no official counts or expert estimates showing unemployment has reached half of that figure.\nBishop\u2019s claim is only valid if we consider that 26 million people is equal to the working population of a specific group of 25 states, or if we look past the definition of \"idle\" and consider Americans who weren\u2019t laid off, but whose wages were affected by the coronavirus outbreak.\nHis claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.
