We will no longer allow it to be used against our American colleagues.\" His comments were met with a large public applause at the University of South Texas and a party had to receive a threat note from the state legislature in Texas. They also lit a questionable Facebook publication, in which they participated after a day of discussion. This article was referred to as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The article contained a popular diary derived from parts of Drake's 2015 music video of Hotline Bling. The Mema is traditionally marked by two images of the singer and a text of the viewer generated by the poster. The idea is to make it look like Drake's avoiding the first phrase, but he welcomes the second one. In this article, the first phrase is: \"Beto O'Rourke wants to confiscate weapons because it's liberal.\" The second, for which Drake seems to indicate his approval, says: \"Beto O'Rourke wants to confiscate weapons because he cannot buy one himself because of his criminal record.\" The text of the article says, \"This theft and Dway will get you every time.\" We've looked at the record of O'Rourke's arrest in the past, but is he not qualified to buy a weapon, as the article indicates? Aurroc was arrested twice in the 1990s for what he described as a fence jump on campus at the University of Texas in El Paso and for driving his car drunk. He was first arrested in May 1995 on the campus of the University of Otib for forced entry, according to a copy of the police report submitted by the Aurourke campaign in 2018. The charge was committed under part of the State Penal Code, article 30-02. In 2005, Oork told El Paso Times that UTEP \"decided not to press charges\" and checked LexisNexis' background to O'Rourke shows that B-class misdemeanours were rejected. In September 1998, Aurroc was arrested and accused of driving a drunken car in Anthony, a small town outside El Paso. One witness told the police officers that they saw Aurroc driving at high speed before losing control of his car and hitting a truck, according to a police report on the incident. He then tried to stay away from him, but according to the report, the witness stopped him. The law enforcement forces arrived and arrested Aurourke, recorded as having registered 0.136 and 0.134 in the breathing analysis test, above the level of blood alcohol of 0.10, the legal limit of the State at that time. Aurroc was charged with a misdemeanour, but was dismissed after completing a programme for the diversion of a misdemeanour in 1999. In summary: Aurourke was arrested for two separate crimes in the 1990s, including a misdemeanour against the DWI Foundation. Both cases were rejected. Orroc can buy a gun. A person is not required to have a licence or licence to purchase rifles, rifles or guns in the state of Orroc, Texas. As long as the buyer is older than 18 years and, in some cases, crosses the background check, the person concerned can legally purchase a firearm without a permit. \u2022 (A permit is required to carry a gun in public places). The Federal Act requires licensed arms dealers to carry out background checks of a person seeking to purchase a weapon if he or she does not have a licence to carry it. However, private sellers do not have the same requirement. On 29 January 2021, federal and state laws in Texas prohibit any person from buying and possessing a weapon if he or she has already been convicted of a felony or of certain offences related to domestic assault. Some people with a history of mental illness are also prohibited from buying a gun. Aurourke will be able to buy a weapon, because he was not convicted of theft or driving while drunk - the charges were dismissed. Even if convicted, neither charge will prevent him from legally buying and possessing a firearm today, since they are offences unrelated to domestic violence and have been dissolved more than five years ago. Aurourke can also obtain a licence for a DWI felony weapon that plays a more important role when it comes to obtaining a licence to carry a weapon in Texas. The State law allows people, including persons belonging to the above-mentioned prohibited groups, to possess a gun in their homes or cars without a licence to carry it. People can also carry guns and rifles in public places without a licence. In order to buy a weapon without checking its background and carry a gun in public, a person must obtain a licence to carry it from the State. The conditions for obtaining such a licence are more stringent than those for the mere purchase of a weapon. More importantly, in the case of Aur\u00fcrk, the requirement that a person is not currently facing charges of \"category A, category B or similar offence\" and the requirement that an individual\" has not been convicted, in the five years prior to the date of submission of the application, of a category A, category B or similar offence.\" The Act also provides that a person is not entitled to a licence to bear him if he has been \"convicted twice during the 10-year period preceding the date on which the person applies for a licence for a class B or more offence involving the use of alcohol or controlled substance as a legal element of the offence.\" Aurroc was arrested for robbery in 1995, a crime that was dismissed. He was arrested for a felony offence in 1998 and also rejected after completing a diversion programme. None of the arrests, separate or together, can prevent him from obtaining a licence to carry a weapon under Texas law. \"He has no convictions in his record, so there is no consequential result, in exchange for his ability to obtain a weapon licence,\" said Steve Toland, Austin's defense attorney who deals with DWI cases. The Texas Department of Public Safety, which runs the licensing programme, provides responses to questions frequently posed on its website, including how the charges against it affect eligibility. \"If the charges were dismissed without trial, then they would not be dropped,\" says the article. If O'Rorke DWI had not been denied and convicted, he would still be eligible to apply for a weapons licence today, as more than five years had passed. If O'Rourke had applied for a licence after his arrest, he would not have been eligible for a weapons licence when the charges were still pending. However, since he had not been convicted of either charge, he would have been eligible for a licence after his case had been dismissed. Our Facebook article published after the democratic debate said that O'Rourke could not buy a weapon \"because of his criminal record.\" Aurroc was arrested for a misdemeanour in the 1990s - for theft and DWI. Both cases were dismissed and neither was convicted. O'Rourke could have passed a background check on the gun and obtained a licence to carry it as soon as the charges were dismissed. Even if he had been convicted of these charges, he could still buy a gun today. We value this allegation wrong. Error: The statement is not accurate", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00150"}
