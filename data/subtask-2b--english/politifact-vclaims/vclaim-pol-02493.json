It is funded jointly by the federal government and the states. In 2016, CHIP served 8.9 million beneficiaries.\nThe reauthorization \"should have been done in September, first of all,\" Pelosi said in her Jan. 18, 2018. \"Second of all, we wanted 10 years \u2026 which, by the way, saves $6 billion.\"\nRepublicans, she added, rejected a 10-year reauthorization. \"Doing it for six years saves $1 billion. That's good,\" she said. \"Doing it 10 years, saving $6 billion is better. In fact, it's best.\"\nA few days later, after government funding had lapsed, lawmakers decided to include a six-year CHIP reauthorization in the bill that reopened the government.\nWe were struck by Pelosi\u2019s claim that a federal program to provide health coverage for 8.9 million children and pregnant women could actually save the government money, rather than costing it. So we took a closer look.\nWhen we contacted Pelosi\u2019s staff, they pointed us to a Congressional Budget Office analysis of the pending reauthorization bill that had been released the previous day, Jan. 17. CBO is Congress\u2019 nonpartisan arbiter of projected costs of legislation.\nCBO said that a six-year CHIP reauthorization would produce an additional $8.204 billion in revenue, but only $7.223 billion in additional costs. That means a cumulative savings of $981 million, or nearly $1 billion.

Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs for a 10-year reauthorization, Pelosi\u2019s office pointed us to a Jan. 11, 2018, CBO analysis.\nThe report projected a 10-year reauthorization \"would decrease the deficit by $6 billion over the 2018-2027 period.\"\nSo Pelosi was correct on the numbers.\nThe broader question: Why does CHIP save the government money? In short, it\u2019s because the alternatives cost more.\nAccording to CBO, \"extending funding for CHIP for 10 years yields net savings to the federal government because the federal costs of the alternatives to providing coverage through CHIP (primarily Medicaid, subsidized coverage in the marketplaces, and employment-based insurance) are larger than the costs of providing coverage through CHIP during that period.\"\n\"It\u2019s a very popular program across party lines, and the CBO score had it saving money,\" said Linda Blumberg, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute who studies health care policy.\nOur ruling\nPelosi said that reauthorizing the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program \"for six years saves $1 billion\" and that doing it for 10 years saves $6 billion.\nCBO analyses back up Pelosi\u2019s numbers. Because the reauthorization of CHIP would essentially take the place of more expensive programs, doing so would eventually net savings for the government.
