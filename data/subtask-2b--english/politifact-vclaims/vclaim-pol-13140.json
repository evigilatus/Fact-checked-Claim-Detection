Scott says 12 percent of high schools produce half of nation's dropouts", "text": "U.S. Rep Bobby Scott cited a staggering statistic when he announced he was introducing a measure to curb the high school dropout rate.\n\n\"Nearly 2,000 high schools - roughly 12 percent of all secondary schools in the United States - produce about half of the nation\u2019s dropouts,\" Scott, D-3rd, said in an April 7 news release.\n\nIs it true that such a small percentage of the nation\u2019s high schools have such a large impact on the country\u2019s dropout problem?\n\nScott\u2019s office directed us to a 2007 report by Robert Balfanz, co-director of the Everyone Graduates Center at Johns Hopkins University and a widely quoted expert on the dropout issue.\n\nBased on 2006 data, the report classified 1,999 high schools across the nation as \"low performing.\" Balfanz said these schools, representing about 14 percent of the nation\u2019s regular and vocational high schools enrolling 100 or more students, reliably produced 50 percent of America\u2019s dropouts. He dubbed them dubbed \"dropout factories.\"\n\nAn even greater share of the nation\u2019s minority dropouts came from these schools: 81 percent of Native Americans; 73 percent of African-Americans and 66 percent of Latinos. They were attended by 34 percent of the white dropouts.\n\nScott accurately characterized the numbers in the report. But the study is several years old and we wanted to take an updated look.\n\nBalfanz re-examined the issue with other researchers in a 2010 report titled \"Building a Grad Nation.\" Using U.S. Department of Education figures, the authors found the number of the country\u2019s worst-performing schools had fallen from 2,007 in 2002 to 1,746 in 2008.\n\nThe study was co-sponsored by the America\u2019s Promise Alliance. Co-founded by retired Army General and Secretary of State Colin Powell, the non-profit group has proposed a \"Civic Marshall Plan\" to increase the number of students completing high school.\n\nA March 2011 update of the \"Building a Grad Nation\" study found that in 2009, the latest year statistics are available, the number of dropout factories fell yet again to 1,634.\n\nThose 1,634 low-performing schools represent about 10 to 12 percent of the nation\u2019s high schools and still produce about half of the nation\u2019s drop outs, said Colleen Wilber, a spokeswoman for the America\u2019s Promise Alliance.\n\nEvery state has at least one \"dropout factory,\" which Balfanz defines as a school in which at least 40 percent of freshmen fail to make it to their senior year. For high schools that only have grades 10-12, his reports examine how sophomore year enrollment compares to the senior year.\n\nThe reports do not identify any of the troubled schools by name. The largest number are in the South. Virginia had 29 of them in 2009, 25 in 2008, and 26 back in 2002.\n\nScott\u2019s bill -- also introduced in the Senate by Democrat Tom Harkin of Iowa -- would strengthen regulations developed in 2008 that require states to use the same formula in reporting high school graduation rates. It would set a national graduation rate goal of 90 percent. The national high school graduation was 74.9 percent in 2008, the last year data was available.\n\nTo sum up:\n\nScott said that nearly 2,000 high schools, about 12 percent of those in the U.S., produce half the nation\u2019s dropouts.\n\nHe accurately cited a report based on 2006 data. An updated study found the number of low-performing schools dropped to 1,634 in 2009. \u00a0That does not diminish Scott\u2019s point that a small percentage of high schools have an enormous impact on the nation\u2019s dropout problem.\n\nWe rate Scott\u2019s claim True.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13140"}
