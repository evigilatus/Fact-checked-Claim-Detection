Scott Walker plans to push for legislation allowing the state to take over municipal governments", "text": "Wisconsin isn\u2019t the only state stirring national political headlines. In Michigan, a new law allows the governor to take over local governments deemed to be in financial trouble.\n\nBenton Harbor is one of several Michigan municipalities that failed a financial \"stress test\" and is now under the control of a state-appointed manager who, among other things, has the power to scrap contracts with public employee unions. Local elected officials are no longer in control.\n\nProtests are mounting over what critics have called a \"dictatorship\" and at least once lawsuit claims the measure gives the state \"czar-like\" powers.\n\nCould financial \"martial law\" declarations be coming to Wisconsin?\n\nAccording to long-time Democratic activist Ed Garvey, such steps are next on the agenda of Republican Gov. Scott Walker. He first raised the issue April 14, 2011 on his \u00a0Fightingbob.com blog, then repeated it in subsequent postings, on Wisconsin Public Radio and in an interview with PolitiFact Wisconsin.\n\nRick Ungar, a blogger on Forbes.com, picked up Garvey\u2019s assertions April 16 with a posting entitled \"Gov. Scott Walker Reportedly Planning Financial Martial Law in Wisconsin.\"\n\nTwo days later, during an April 18 radio interview, Walker vehemently denied being involved with any such plan.\n\nSo has Garvey exposed Team Walker\u2019s next controversial political push?\n\nNow, we can\u2019t rule on prospective claims -- what will happen in the future. But we can look at what Garvey says he has already done -- expose plans that are under way -- and whether his evidence supports his own claim.\n\nLet\u2019s go to Garvey\u2019s original blog post.\n\n\"We have discovered that Wisconsin's governor has the same twisted idea for Wisconsin as Michigan's governor does of his state,\" Garvey wrote April 14, 2011 on his blog. \"The state would be allowed to take over local governments if financial management standards are not met. Who decides? The governor or a newly elected uber comptroller. (I am not making this up.)\"\n\nHe adds: \"The secret plan is being prepared by the state's largest law firm, Foley & Lardner, for the Greater Milwaukee Committee, the Bradley Foundation, the governor, and key legislators.\"\n\nA closer look at the evidence shows it\u2019s not as Machiavellian as Garvey claims.\n\nGarvey discovered a recently launched website, Makeityourmilwaukeecounty.com That spells out a legislative initiative. However, it\u2019s hardly a secret.\n\nThe site is the online version of a project launched by a Greater Milwaukee Committee task force. It\u2019s an outgrowth of a years-long effort by the private business group to study and recommend reforms to Milwaukee County government.\n\nThe task force\u2019s recommendations drew attention in an Oct. 9, 2010 column by the Journal Sentinel\u2019s Dan Bice, who wrote the recommendations were back-burnered so as not to come out before the November election for governor.\n\nIn November, PolitiFact Wisconsin looked at a claim by the state Democratic Party that GMC chairman and Walker campaign chairman Michael Grebe killed release of the report before the election. We said the claim was Barely True.\n\nIn February, the GMC task force made its recommendations public and the website launched about the same time.\n\nThe report calls for several initiatives, including: \"Develop a statewide fiscal stress test through the State Department of Revenue to help local governments maintain fiscal health.\"\n\nSo, the site does talk about a \"stress test,\" but that\u2019s not the same as the \"martial law\" style approach in Michigan. In fact, the website explicitly says the group is opposed to that approach: \"The Initiative does not support this type of legislation in Wisconsin.\"\n\nWhat\u2019s more, according to GMC president Julia Taylor, about half the states have a \"fiscal scorecard.\" \u00a0The thinking, she said, is that the more the public knows about how their local government is faring, the sooner problems can be headed off.\n\nTaylor said she wasn\u2019t sure when a bill including the GMC\u2019s plan would be introduced or by whom.\n\n\"It\u2019s very, very early in the process,\" she said. \"At this point we don\u2019t have draft language.\"\n\n\nTo be sure, some heavy-hitters are working with the GMC to build support for the recommendations and hammer them into legislation -- including lobbyists with Foley & Lardner, former state legislator Mary Panzer and public relations firm Mueller Communications. And the GMC is chaired by Grebe, who was Walker\u2019s campaign chairman and led the governor\u2019s transition team. Grebe also heads the conservative Bradley Foundation.\n\nSo, it may be easy to see why Garvey tries to connect some of the dots.\n\nWhat about the essence of Garvey\u2019s claim, that he discovered Walker\u2019s involvement with the plan being discussed -- and, therefore, his support of it?\n\nAs Milwaukee County executive, Walker expressed support for the GMC efforts. But in the wake of Garvey\u2019s first blog post, he issued a sharp denial about involvement now.\n\n\"No truth to it whatsoever. \u00a0Absolutely a bogus story,\" Walker said April 18, 2011 in an interview with WTMJ-AM (620) \u00a0talk show host Charlie Sykes. \u00a0\"There's nobody on my staff, nobody in my administration, I'm certainly not working anything remotely close to that.\" \u00a0\n\nNevertheless, Garvey said in an interview that he still believes that Walker is involved.\n\n\"I think that\u2019s true,\" he said. \"It all sort of fits in with a pattern.\"\n\nBut thinking something is true and showing it to be true are two different things.\n\nGarvey says he discovered a secret plot by Walker to push Michigan-style legislation that would allow the state to test the finances of local governments and then take over the bad apples.\n\nThe Greater Milwaukee Committee is proposing a \"good-government\" style website that would allow citizens to compare and contrast the health of local government finances. But it explicitly stops short of a Michigan-style approach.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Garvey did not uncover it (it was previously announced by the group) and he\u2019s provided no direct evidence of involvement from Walker, who vehemently denies it. The measure could change through the legislative process, but that\u2019s the future.\n\nGarvey had a \"scoop.\" But it was more of the gardening -- and not journalistic -- variety. We rate his claim False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13149"}
