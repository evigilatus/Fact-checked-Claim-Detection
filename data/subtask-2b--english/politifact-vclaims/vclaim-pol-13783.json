The post by Heflin, a former Texas House member and past chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, closes: \"This is not to say that the process of developing a 2012-13 state budget will be a walk in the park. But claims that Texas is $27 billion in the red are flat-out false.\"\n\nFlat-out for real?\n\nWe wondered because news organizations including the Austin American-Statesman included the $27 billion figure in their analyses of Combs\u2019 forecast.\n\nThe Statesman\u2019s Jan. 11 news article states: \"The comptroller's estimate sets the limit for spending and would put the budget shortfall at $27 billion if the state were to maintain the same level of service in public education, health and human services, prisons and more.\"\n\nSimilarly, the San Antonio Express-News quotes Scott McCown, executive director of the left-leaning Center for Public Policy Priorities, saying the shortfall is at least $26.8 billion--the difference between Combs\u2019 predicted state income and at least $99 billion in state revenue needed to maintain the current level of services, given the state's growing population and rising costs, including that of health care.\n\nThe newspaper quotes Rep. Jim Pitts, R-Waxahachie, who chairs the House Appropriations Committee, saying that a shortfall of at least $27 billion is \"in the ballpark\" when looking at the money needed to provide the current level of services.\n\nIn his update, Heflin writes that the $27 billion figure is \"premised on the \u00a0belief that the state should carry forward all current spending and assumptions regarding program growth.\" He adds that policy advocates touting the figure are simply tallying agencies\u2019 wish lists; his post links to a Legislative Budget Board website compiling requests filed by more than 200 agencies. Heflin\u2019s post continues: \"But these requests are almost never fully funded -- even at the start of the budget process -- because they include many unnecessary spending items that appropriators recognize and quickly weed out.\"\n\nSeeking the basis of the $27 billion figure, we contacted McCown, who pointed us to his Jan. 10 statement saying that based solely on requests from several major agencies and expected formula-driven costs of higher education, Texas needs to spend $19.9 billion more in state funds in 2012-13 than what\u2019s budgeted for 2010-11. That would bump the budget to $99 billion, McCown said, which exceeds Combs\u2019 estimate of available state revenue by $27 billion.\n\nAccording to his statement, the center reached the $19.9 billion figure by adding up requested budget increases tied to population and cost growth made by five agencies -- the Texas Education Agency ($9 billion increase), the Texas Health and Human Services Commission ($8.3 billion increase), the Texas Department of Criminal Justice ($730 million increase), the Employees Retirement System ($576 million increase) and Teacher Retirement System of Texas ($908 million increase). It then added increases for public colleges and universities that would be driven by state higher-education funding formulas, McCown\u2019s statement says. All told, the statement says, the selected agencies and education institutions account for 82 percent of state spending.\n\nFootnotes to the center\u2019s summary of its calculations indicate that more than $8 billion in the identified education and health and human services funding is needed to replace federal stimulus aid used in the last budget but not expected again this year.\n\nEva DeLuna Castro, the center\u2019s senior budget analyst, said she excluded some of the selected agencies\u2019 requests, such as one for staffing a health center for prisoners, that don\u2019t reflect what the agencies are already doing.\n\nIn an interview, McCown said those who question the shortfall \"are not being honest. They\u2019re trying to confuse the public . . . We\u2019re short $27 billion to do what we\u2019re doing. Obviously, if you don\u2019t want to do what we\u2019re doing, then we\u2019re not short.\"\n\nAccording to the Statesman, state leaders including GOP Gov. Rick Perry are dismissive of needing to cover $27 billion in additional spending. Perry said in a Jan. 10 interview with the newspaper: \"I'll let somebody else talk about that, because that's not reality.\"\n\nIn the end, we suppose, the final budget and its impact will determine reality.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut that\u2019s down the road. For now, what legislative budget-writers have to go on are what they always have early in the process: State agencies\u2019 self-reported funding needs. And for now, it looks like the cost to continue services as they are exceeds the $27 billion suggested by the CPPP's analysis, which did not consider all agency requests.\n\nFinally, we followed up with Heflin, who said in an interview that he composed his post before reading McCown\u2019s numerical analysis. Heflin said he has no quibble with its methodology, but disputes the premise that lawmakers should maintain existing services. When \"you know you don\u2019t have the money, you know you have to trim back,\" Heflin said. He followed up via e-mail: \"There was never a possibility of funding a current-services\u2019 budget plus wish lists and growth.\"\n\nOur sense: Heflin\u2019s statement rejects a shortfall calculation that seems a reasonable way to estimate how much it would cost Texas to keep up services. We rate the statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13783"}
