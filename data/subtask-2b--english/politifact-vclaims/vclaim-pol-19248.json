Kevin Brady, R-Texas,\u00a0expressed\u00a0dismay at how a\u00a0moratorium\u00a0on leasing would impact jobs in Texas\u2019 oil and gas sector.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"Killing more Texas jobs,\" Brady said\u00a0in a\u00a0Jan. 22\u00a0tweet. \"After killing #KeystoneXL pipeline, #Biden suspends new oil/gas leasing on fed lands/water. If permanent, 120,000 TX jobs lost. 120,000 MORE jobless. Pssst... aren't you supposed to CREATE jobs?\"\u00a0\nBiden\u2019s move will have a disproportionate\u00a0effect on states with large swaths of federal lands\u00a0used for oil and gas activity.\u00a0New Mexico, for instance, has 24 million acres of federal land, or about 32% of the state\u2019s total land mass; Wyoming has 29 million federally owned acres, or about 47% of the state.\u00a0\nTexas, on the other hand, has very\u00a0little\u00a0federally-owned\u00a0land\u00a0\u2014\u00a03 million acres, or\u00a02%\u00a0of the state.\u00a0Nearly half of\u00a0that\u00a0is\u00a0managed by the U.S. National Park Service.\u00a0As of 2019, about 185,000 acres were\u00a0under\u00a0lease for oil and gas\u00a0production\u00a0in Texas.\u00a0\nAlthough most of Texas\u2019 oil and gas industry is based onshore,\u00a0a sliver of the industry is actively drilling\u00a0in\u00a0federal waters in the Gulf\u00a0of Mexico.\u00a0As of Jan. 22, there\u00a0were 16 offshore\u00a0rigs in the Gulf compared\u00a0with\u00a0175\u00a0on\u00a0Texas\u00a0land, according to the Baker Hughes rig\u00a0count.\u00a0(In February last year,\u00a0before the coronavirus pandemic dealt major blows to the\u00a0global oil industry, about 20 rigs were deployed in the Gulf compared to around 400 onshore\u00a0in Texas.)\u00a0\nWith such a small fraction of the state\u2019s industry\u00a0likely\u00a0impacted by Biden\u2019s directive, is Brady correct when he says that\u00a0120,000\u00a0Texas\u00a0jobs\u00a0are at stake?\u00a0\nNew vs. existing leasing\u00a0\nAccording to Brady\u2019s aides, the number he\u00a0cited is pulled from a study released\u00a0last year\u00a0by the American Petroleum Institute, an industry trade and lobbyist group.\u00a0The\u00a0study estimated that a ban on new and existing leases would cost nearly\u00a01\u00a0million jobs\u00a0by 2022, with top production-states hit the hardest. While Texas would lose 120,000 jobs, New Mexico would lose\u00a062,000 and Wyoming\u00a0would\u00a0lose 33,000, the study says.\u00a0\nBut the Biden administration\u2019s moratorium on federal land leasing halts only new leases\u00a0from being issued.\nBrady\u2019s tweet\u00a0misses this distinction. He\u00a0said that the ban on new leasing would cost Texas 120,000 jobs, while the study he cited totaled losses tied to\u00a0banning\u00a0both new and\u00a0existing leases.\nThe petroleum institute hasn\u2019t released estimates of how many jobs will be impacted by Biden\u2019s\u00a0order. Another group, the\u00a0Wyoming Energy Authority, released a study last month that determined a ban on new leasing\u00a0alone would impact 58,700 jobs in the eight states that make up the majority of public land\u00a0production, which does not include Texas.\nHowever, an American Petroleum Institute\u00a0spokesperson said it's reasonable to expect the administration\u00a0will\u00a0expand the ban to include existing\u00a0leases as well.\u00a0\n\"We view this as a first step toward a federal leasing ban that would impact all oil and gas development on federal lands and water,\" said\u00a0spokesperson\u00a0Bethany\u00a0Aronhalt.\u00a0\nThis expectation is based on numerous remarks\u00a0the president\u00a0has made on the issue. For instance, during a 2020 primary debate, Biden\u00a0said \"no more drilling on federal lands. No more drilling, including offshore. No ability for the oil industry to continue to drill, period\u00a0\u2014\u00a0ends.\"\u00a0And\u00a0Aaronhalt\u00a0highlighted how Biden's nominee for\u00a0interior\u00a0secretary, environmentalist and progressive Deb Haaland of New Mexico,\u00a0has been unequivocal in\u00a0her opposition to leasing federal lands and waters\u00a0to the industry.\u00a0\n\"I am wholeheartedly against fracking and drilling on public lands,\" she told\u00a0The Guardian\u00a0in 2019. \"Public lands are a statement about who we are as Americans. The most pristine and beautiful places in our country should never belong to one person.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGulf jobs\u00a0\nIf Biden did ban all federal leasing \u2014 new and existing, onshore and offshore \u2014\u00a0does Texas stand to lose 120,000 jobs by 2022?\u00a0\n\"Most of the Texas impact is due to closing development of the Gulf of Mexico, of the offshore\" drilling, said\u00a0Geoff Brand,\u00a0Senior Economic Advisor at the American Petroleum Institute.\u00a0\nDrilling in the Gulf of Mexico supports about 300,000 jobs, according to a Bureau of Ocean Energy Management\u00a0estimate.\u00a0This figure represents both jobs created\u00a0directly\u00a0by industry \u2014 like offshore drilling,\u00a0platform construction and platform staffing \u2014 and the jobs\u00a0indirectly\u00a0created by\u00a0the industry, like service companies and other onshore support operations.\u00a0In\u00a0economic terms, the 300,000 figure represents jobs created by the industry\u2019s direct, indirect and induced economic impacts.\u00a0\nThat workforce is sourced primarily from Texas and\u00a0Louisiana, each of which\u00a0contribute\u00a0about 150,000 workers\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0offshore\u00a0industry, Brand said.\u00a0The\u00a0projected 120,000 Texas jobs lost due to a possible ban on\u00a0new and existing federal leases\u00a0would impact\u00a0roughly 80% of Texas\u2019 offshore workforce.\u00a0\nThis figure is so high, Brand said,\u00a0because\u00a0most jobs are created when the industry spends capital\u00a0up-front on\u00a0drilling\u00a0new wells\u00a0and\u00a0constructing new platforms.\u00a0A complete ban on new leasing or permits would grind\u00a0that development to a halt.\u00a0\n\"If you stop drilling and expanding, then you\u2019re just\u00a0maintaining production platforms,\" Brand said. \"It's kind of like building a pipeline \u2014 you get most the jobs up front when you spend the capitol and build things. It\u2019s when you spend the money that the jobs are created.\u00a0...\u00a0If you're maintaining a platform, you're spending some operational money, but you're not really spending that much.\"\u00a0\nThe American Petroleum Institute\u2019s study is based on\u00a0the\u00a0National Energy Modeling System,\u00a0a model of\u00a0domestic\u00a0energy markets\u00a0created\u00a0by the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\u00a0The model bases employment numbers on the industry\u2019s rate of spending. The harder it becomes for producers to obtain leases and permits, the less they\u2019re spending on development, which,\u00a0as a result, sheds jobs.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe methodology behind the institute\u2019s analysis\u00a0is unobjectionable, according to Karr Ingham, a petroleum economist with the Texas Alliance of Energy Producers.\u00a0\n\"If that activity is just stopped wholesale, what do you think's going to happen to those jobs?\" he said.\u00a0\n\"Even someone who's utterly opposed to energy production, offshore production, federal lands production, whatever the case may be, taking issue with the way they went about this (analysis) would be a difficult proposition. They started with a sound model and went through sound processes to end up with state-level impacts,\" Ingham said.\u00a0\nAlthough the industry will adjust to Biden\u2019s directive by reallocating resources to drilling on non-federal lands and waters, those adjustments\u00a0will be\u00a0gradual\u00a0and may not impact short-term economic projections.\u00a0\u00a0\nSimilarly, it will\u00a0take time for\u00a0jobs in the fossil fuel industry to be replaced by jobs\u00a0created\u00a0in new energy sectors.\u00a0The administration has stressed the importance of\u00a0green\u00a0job creation\u00a0as it shrinks the fossil fuel sector.\u00a0Biden\u2019s Build Back Better economic recovery plan pledges to\u00a0\"create millions of good-paying union jobs\"\u00a0by\u00a0building a \"clean energy economy.\"\u00a0\nBut Ingham says it will take\u00a0time\u00a0before these new industries are replacing lost fossil fuel jobs on a one-to-one ratio.\u00a0\n\"If a job gets lost some time in the next 12 months, what are you going to replace that job with? Where are those folks going to go\" Ingham said. \"It's not like\u00a0for\u00a0every job you eliminate in the oil and gas sector, a green energy job springs up on the other\u00a0side.\"\u00a0\nOur ruling\u00a0\nAnticipating Biden\u2019s move to ban leasing on federal lands and waters, Brady said that\u00a0a permanent ban on new leasing will cost Texas 120,000 jobs.\u00a0\nBrady\u00a0pulled\u00a0that\u00a0number\u00a0from\u00a0a report released last year by the American Petroleum Institute. However, the institute said that the 120,000 figure\u00a0is based on\u00a0a ban of\u00a0both new and existing federal leases, which is more far-reaching than Biden\u2019s actions so far.\u00a0Brady\u2019s comment\u00a0ignores that distinction.\u00a0\u00a0\nOtherwise, the 120,000\u00a0job\u00a0losses\u00a0projected by the institute\u2019s analysis is accurate given that it was based on\u00a0modeling from the federal National Energy Modeling System.\u00a0\nWe rate this claim\u00a0Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19248"}
