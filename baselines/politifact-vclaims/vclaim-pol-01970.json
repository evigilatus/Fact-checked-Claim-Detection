This is an unsubstantiated, ridiculous allegation by conspiracy theorists who have tried to link the Clintons to criminal activity for years.\n\"Investigators: Anthony Bourdain was killed by Clinton operatives,\" said a June 10, 2018, headline from YourNewsWire.com, a website with a history of peddling falsehoods online. The report cited a similar article from News Media Central, an \"alternative media\" site that considers itself \"free from establishment influence,\" according to its about page.\nFacebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed.

As evidence of a link between Bourdain\u2019s death and the Clintons, the report pointed to two tweets from Bourdain.\nThe first tweet, posted Oct. 11, 2017, criticized Hillary Clinton over an interview with CNN\u2019s Fareed Zakaria during which she said she was \"appalled\" to discover that there was \"a different side\" to her longtime donor Harvey Weinstein, a film producer who was accused by several women \u2014 including Bourdain\u2019s girlfriend, Asia Argento \u2014 of sexual assault. Bourdain called Clinton\u2019s response \"uninspiring,\" and many Clinton supporters responded on Twitter, including former Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon.\nIn the second tweet, sent May 2, 2018, Bourdain said he was \"in no way (a Hillary Clinton) fan\" and that he had \"been on the receiving end of her operatives\u2019 wrath\" before. The Twitter thread started when Bourdain shared a Rolling Store story about Donald Trump attorney Michael Cohen, writing, \"The glorious career of \u2018Fast\u2019 Mikey Cohen. Nothing to see here, folks. Totally legit.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on February 8, 2021 in a Newsmax TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOnly one person died on that day\u201d during the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 February 9, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe YourNewsWire.com report suggested that these tweets show the Clintons as likely responsible for Bourdain\u2019s death.\nThe YourNewsWire.com report, like other Clinton-related conspiracies before it, crumbles under the microscope.
