I believe it\u2019s higher than \u2014 give me a place that you think is pretty bad,\" Trump said Aug. 1.\nTrump listened to the crowd. Then he said, \"The guy says \u2018Afghanistan.\u2019 I believe it\u2019s higher than Afghanistan.\"\nThe line got a reaction from the crowd, and in a most literal sense, Trump has a point. But experts who study crime say comparing a city to a country is a misleading political talking point.\nJust the numbers\nBaltimore, a city of just over 600,000, saw 309 homicides last year. That translates to a rate of more than 51 homicides for 100,000 residents.\nThat puts Baltimore\u2019s homicide rate higher than El Salvador (50), Honduras (41), Guatemala (22) and Afghanistan (7), based on the most recent available annual data. (The data isn\u2019t perfect, as we\u2019ll note later.)\n\nNote: The United Nations said deaths from armed conflict are typically excluded from data on intentional killings, but also notes there are \"challenges of determining the nature of conflict versus non-conflict deaths in Afghanistan.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nA flawed approach\nSo that\u2019s the approach Trump took to make his claim. But it\u2019s a flawed one, experts told us. To better understand, consider the difference in crime rates of urban and rural areas.\u00a0\nTypically, cities experience more crime, including homicides, than rural areas.\u00a0\nBased on population density, the city of Baltimore is considered an urban area. By contrast, the Northern Triangle countries, as well as Afghanistan, are a mix of both urban and rural.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

Last year, five municipalities that account for only 22% of El Salvador\u2019s population saw 40% of the country\u2019s homicides, according to the State Department\u2019s Overseas Security Advisory Council.\nA fairer measure would be to compare the homicide rates of Baltimore with a place like San Salvador, El Salvador\u2019s capital and its most populous city. According to a ranking of the world\u2019s most dangerous cities by the Mexican nongovernmental group Citizens' Council for Public Security, in 2017 San Salvador\u2019s homicide rate was 59 per 100,000 residents \u2014 higher than Baltimore\u2019s 2018 homicide rate.\nPhilip Cook, a sociologist at Duke University, noted that rates fluctuate depending on a number of factors, and rates in Central America can be especially volatile.\u00a0\nThe homicide rate in El Salvador in 2015 was 103 \u2014 more than double its 2018 number. Cook added that some Central American data also tend to undercount the true number of homicides, another complicating factor when comparing it to an American city.\n\"Given the likelihood of a substantial undercount,\" Cook said, \"I would not bet the ranch that El Salvador was safer than Baltimore in 2018.\"\nAnother way to look at homicide rates would be to compare Maryland, which includes Baltimore, to the countries Trump mentioned. In that case, however, the comparison falls apart.\nMaryland (with a population a little over 6 million) had a homicide rate of 9 per 100,000 people, compared to El Salvador (50), Honduras (41), Guatemala (22) and Afghanistan (7).\nOur ruling\nTrump said Baltimore has a higher homicide rate than El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala and Afghanistan.\nThe comparison is flawed, because it uses the homicide rates of entire countries \u2014 which are a blend of relatively higher-crime urban areas and lower-crime rural areas \u2014 as a measuring stick to gauge the level of violence in a city.\u00a0\u00a0\nWe rate this Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00366"}
