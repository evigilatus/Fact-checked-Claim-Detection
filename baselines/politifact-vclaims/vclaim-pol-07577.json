On her website, she claimed that the law \"already has caused millions of hardworking Virginians to lose their health insurance and have their well-being and financial health threatened.\"\nWe hadn\u2019t heard that statistic before and wondered if it could be correct that -- in a state with about 8 million people -- \"millions\" had already lost their insurance because of the law.\nWe asked Comstock\u2019s campaign for proof and were told it made an error.\n\"Our website said \u2018Virginians\u2019 when it should have read \u2018Americans\u2019,\" Johanna Persing, the communications director for Comstock\u2019s campaign, emailed. Comstock changed the wording on her site.\nThere\u2019s no doubt that millions of Americans in the individual market -- those who purchase health insurance themselves or are covered by small employers -- were notified last fall that their policies were being discontinued because they don\u2019t fulfill minimum coverage requirements under Obamacare.\nNo one could say exactly how many policies were cancelled, but media reports estimated the number was at least 4 million. The embarrassed White House offered a fix that allowed many of the disqualified plans to exist for another year. Some people were moved to a different plan by their insurance companies or got coverage on state exchanges created by the health care law.\nBut Comstock\u2019s original claim raises an interesting question: How many Virginians received notices last year that their policies were ending?\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia doesn\u2019t keep those figures, said Ken Schrad, a spokesman for the State Corporation Commission.\nDoug Gray, the executive director with the Virginia Association of Health Plans, estimates 850,000 Virginians who bought their plans individually or got coverage through a small employer were notified their plans were discontinued.\nGray stressed, however, that those people were given a choice to switch to a new plan or to renew their original policy for another year. A majority of them chose to keep their original policy through this year, he said.\nOur ruling\nComstock\u2019s website said that millions of Virginians lost their health insurance because of Obamacare.\nHer campaign acknowledged it erred and, after our inquiry, changed its site to say millions of \"Americans\" lost their health insurance. While we applaud the campaign\u2019s admission of a mistake, that does not unplug the Truth-O-Meter.\nThere\u2019s no exact count on how many Virginians were notified last year that their plans would be ended because of Obamacare. A state health insurance lobbyist estimates the number at 850,000. But these people still had options; they or their employer could renew their old plans for another year or switch to new coverage.\nSo Comstock\u2019s claim about millions of Virginians losing coverage was unfounded and we rate it False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07577"}
