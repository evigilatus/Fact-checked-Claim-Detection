The prosecution came through a video published by Governor Terrence Williams, who falsely declared that Omar \"celebrated on the anniversary of September 11.\" In his video, Williams weighed on footage of the age of dancing in a crowd to the song \"The Truth Hertz\" by Lizzo. But Omar's dance tape was not filmed on September 11th. In fact, the event was hosted two days later, on September 13, by Omar and four other women from the first term in Congress as members of the Black Caucus of Congress. The footage of Omar's dance was first posted on Twitter on the night of the event by Adam Green, co-founder of the Campaign for Progressive Change, the Political Action Commission. \"Can anyone call something better than Elehan dancing on @lizzo?\" The Green Books. \"Because I can't think of anything.\" Can someone call something better than Elehan dancing on @lizo? Because I can't think of anything. ==External links==*CBC2019#CBCWeek#Cbcwickend pic.twitter.com/KvsCRvgKQX-Adam Green (@AdamGreen) 14 September 2019 Jeremy Salvain, Director of Communications for Omar, participated in a copy of a brochure on the event, which was written as two hours &apos; duration and entitled \"Smartage split.\" After three days of the event, on September 16, Williams uploaded his own video in a tweet that Omar, a Muslim, claimed, \"Shaped in the memory of September 11.\" \"What were you celebrating on the 11th anniversary of September?\" Williams said in the video, which showed Omar's recording, according to factcheck.org. Were you really celebrating the 11th anniversary of September? While millions of Americans were in their homes mourning all the lives that were lost.\" On September 18, Trump retweeted Williams' video and Omar said, \"The new face of the Democratic Party\" and \"The Great State of Minnesota will win us.\" Ihan Omar, a member of O.C. Plus 3, will win us the great state of Minnesota. New face of the Democratic Party! https://t.co/aQFEygSA4D By Samantha Buterman (January 11, 2012), Donald J.

She also repeated a petition from the Green Political Action Committee urging Twitter to suspend Trump &apos; s account until it removed its tweet. The video has since been removed from Williams' Twitter and Facebook accounts. However, Williams, who did not respond to the request for comment, doubled his criticism of Omar and called in a series of tweets to isolate her to name Trump with racism. (The members of Congress can be expelled by their respective chambers, but cannot be isolated.) For his part, Trump wrote twice more about Williams in the same morning participating in the attack on Omar. In August, he also retweeted a video in which Williams suggested without evidence that Bill and Hillary Clinton were behind the death of the shameful financier Jeffrey Epstein. Trump has already published Omar-related lies, wrongly claiming in July that she was \"talking about how cool Al Qaeda is.\" Omar attracted criticism from some circles in March for saying \"some people did something\" in reference to attacks on the World Trade Center. The Trump campaign refused to comment. For information, Omar spent at least part of her night on 11 September, speaking with the Alexandrian Republic of Okasio-Cortiz, Rashida Tlaip, and our eyes at the Congressional Black Caucus conference, according to a video on her Facebook page. Sylvain said that Omar had not attended the other receptions held for the Conference that evening, and confirmed that she would not dance at any other event held that day. Sylvain also said Omar went to the committees and voted during the day. We counted at least six votes she made in the Council between 4:30 and 5:30 p.m. on September 11. The Governor Trump retweeted an article that Elhan Omar said was \"a participant\" on the 11th anniversary of September. The false allegation, shared by a comedian with the help of Trump, which he broadcast to his 64 million followers on Twitter, was based on a video showing Omar dancing at the Black Caucus in Congress. But this event was hosted on September 13, not September 11. We're assessing this statement with pants on fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00145"}
