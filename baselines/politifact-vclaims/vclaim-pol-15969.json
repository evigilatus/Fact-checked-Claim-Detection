David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1996, as a candidate for the Illinois state Senate, Obama filled out a questionnaire for a community group called Independent Voters of Illinois-Independent Precinct Organization. It asked if the candidate supported state legislation to \u201cban the manufacture, sale and possession of handguns.\u201d Obama\u2019s answer: \u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\nThe Obama campaign claimed the questionnaire was filled out by a campaign aide who \u201cunintentionally mischaracterize[d] his position\u201d on gun control and other issues, even though Obama's writing was on another part of the questionnaire. (Tommy Vietor, a spokesman for Obama\u2019s campaign, said in an e-mailed statement to Politico, \u201cHe may have jotted some notes on the front page of the questionnaire at the meeting, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that some answers didn\u2019t reflect his views.\u201d)\n\n\nBut let's assume, for the sake of argument, that Obama approved of what was on the questionnaire. There are still serious problems with using that to justify a claim that Obama has a plan to \"ban the manufacture, sale and possession of handguns.\"\n\n\nFor one thing, the question was about a state law. The NRA claims without qualification that Obama wants to ban handguns, implying that he intends to do so on a national level. Obama says frequently that gun regulation should be tailored to different geographical areas.\n\n\nFor another thing, Obama's answer on the questionnaire was a long time ago. On a more recent questionnaire, he said, \"A complete ban on handguns is not politically practicable,\" but reasonable restrictions should be imposed, according to\n\nthe Associated Press\n\n.\n\n\nAt the Democratic presidential debate in Philadelphia on April 16, 2008, Obama said: \"I have never favored an all-out ban on handguns.\" His vote in 2004, for a bill that authorized the Illinois State Police to issue concealed weapon permits to retired police officers and military police officers, supports that claim. Furthermore, as a state legislator and U.S. senator, Obama has had plenty of opportunity to propose a ban on handguns, and has never done so.\n\n\nObama's alleged endorsement of a proposed state law in 1996 does not add up to a plan to ban handguns, particularly in light of evidence to the contrary that has accumulated since then. We find the NRA's claim to be False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-15969"}
