Anderson said that road-side tests to detect cannabis damage were necessary because if Vermont legitimized a cannabis market, it would see an increase in weak road traffic and death. The saliva tests will enable the police to determine when the medicine is in the driver &apos; s system. \"If the experiments in Colorado and Washington are the experiments that we have here, the deaths on the road will rise, A number of readers told us Anderson was out of the question. So we decided to know: did the legal recreational markets for cannabis in Colorado and Washington lead to high road deaths and a deficit in driving rates? We contacted the GSS and asked for sources to support the Commissioner's claim. In response, the Section sent seven sources - including five studies and news articles from Denver Post and Billingham Herald. All sources show that mortality rates due to poor driving and road deaths have increased since the legalization of cannabis. However, even those data are contradictory. None of the sources have demonstrated that the increase is due to the regulation of the recreational cannabis markets alone, which Anderson seems to show. It is also important to note that there is currently no rigorous road-side test of cannabis disability. At this point, the law enforcement agencies usually use blood tests to determine whether drivers have THC in their system. However, the drug can remain in someone &apos; s blood for weeks, making it difficult to determine when a person is under the influence of drugs. Since 2012, recreational cannabis has become legal in Washington and Colorado. Entertainment stores were opened in 2014. According to a study carried out by the Traffic Safety Foundation in 2016, an estimated 303 drivers - 10 per cent of all drivers involved in fatal collisions in Washington between 2010 and 2014 - have detectable tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a key element in the psychological impact of cannabis, in their blood when or shortly after a crash occurred. According to the study, the number of drivers who underwent positive tests with regard to hemorrhagic infection remained constant before and immediately after the entry into force of the law. The Special Republican Fact-Finding Party in Florida announced on 20 October 2008 in the campaign courier \"Back Obama constantly voted against harsher penalties for criminals.\" However, researchers found that about nine months after the legal availability of cannabis for procurement, the number of drug-led citations began to increase by approximately 10 percentage points per year. It is unclear whether the increase was due to the legalization of cannabis or to \"out-of-school\" factors. A study by the Colorado Department of Transport published in August 2018 reported that the number of deaths of drivers who had undergone positive cannabis testing had almost doubled since the legalization of recreation in 2014 - from 75 in that year to 125 in 2016 and 139 in 2017. However, despite an increase in the number of deaths from cannabis use, in the first quarter of 2017, the number of cannabis-related depleted uranium-related drugs decreased by 33 per cent compared with the same period in 2016, according to the Colorado State Patrol. From January to March 2017, 155 people received cannabis abuse during driving, compared to 232 in 2016. The Colorado study does not indicate that legalization is the reason for the increase in cannabis leadership morbidity. Another study last year, conducted by researchers at the University of Oregon, explicitly stated that the argument that legal cannabis had led to a sharp rise in traffic deaths and weak leadership was misleading. According to authors, the upward trend in cannabis-related deaths in Colorado, and to some extent in Washington, would have occurred whether or not recreational cannabis was legal. Some research clearly supports the claim that road traffic accidents are on the rise in states that have legalized cannabis, but the reason for it remains unclear to researchers. A study released in October by the Highway Safety Insurance Institute and the Highway Loss Data Institute estimated that the combined rate of car accidents had increased by 6 per cent after the start of the sale of retail cannabis in Colorado, Nevada, Oregon and Washington. Based on our research, Anderson's statement that road deaths and weak driving rates have risen in Washington and Colorado is correct. However, it has not been established that the legal recreational market for cannabis is responsible for the high mortality rate caused by driving disability and traffic accidents. While studies do not show that the legal recreational markets for cannabis are responsible for weak leadership and increased traffic deaths in Colorado or Washington, they are a \"hard indicator\" that cannabis can affect the safety of drivers. We're ruling Anderson's statement half right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01161"}
