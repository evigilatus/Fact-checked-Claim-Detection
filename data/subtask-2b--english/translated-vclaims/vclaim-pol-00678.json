Tony Evers, among others. In late April 2019, we learned that the Taiwanese technology giant wanted changes in the $3 billion contract with the country to better reflect the evolving project. The original agreement with the state called the Foxcon Technology Group to build a $10 billion manufacturing and research complex and employ up to 13,000 people throughout Wisconsin. In contrast, it could reach $4 billion in government and local government incentives. After meeting with Tramp on May 1, 2019, Goo told journalists that Foxcon's plans in Wisconsin had not changed. \"It is not right to say that our investment in Wisconsin has changed,\" said Go to Taiwan's media, according to a report in the Asian magazine Nikki. \"We stopped working around October, November of last year because the weather there was cold and snow. We'll continue our work in May when the weather gets warmer.\" In some cases, he echoed that statement made by Foxcon to the Wall Street Journal on 29 April 2019, in which the company reaffirmed its employment obligations and referred to the previous winter. \"After the winter break, which has an impact on construction projects of this magnitude, we now look forward to starting the next stages of construction at the advanced manufacturing facility Gen6 by the summer of 2019, with production expected to start during the last quarter of 2020,\" said the company. The construction crews are not quite shocked by their exposure to cold weather in Wisconsin during those months. So was the weather bad enough, as Joe called it, to cause two months of closure? We checked it out. Joe's claim of ice and cold weather is not really consistent with the weather data maintained by the National Weather Service. The Foxcon Complex is a village in Racine County, Mount Pleasant, United States. The records of Racine show that they didn't snow in October. The average daily temperature was 41.1 degrees per month, slightly below the base of 44 degrees. But not exactly \"sizzy.\" On January 16, 2021, Jordan Rachel stated in Tweedda that the minimum wage of $15 per hour would raise the price of taco bill burrito to $38. \u2022 January 20, 2012, in November, snow fell in six days. The snow depth never exceeded two inches, but the total snowfall in November 6.7 inches was much higher than the historical standard of 1.6 inches. The average temperature in November was 27.5 degrees, compared with a standard of 33.1 degrees. \"We were rather lucky throughout October, November, until January,\" said Dan Pokovich, president of the Milwaukee Building and Building Board. \"It was very desirable to do some things.\" The work suspended in Goo was not really clear, and Foxcon officials did not respond immediately to the request for details of what had been closed and when. It is clear, however, that the work was taking place in two months. The company made a tour of the work site on 4 October 2018, and the newspaper Milwaukee Journal Sentinel described the scene as \"hundreds of workers on the site, a garbage truck coming or going every 12 seconds in the middle of the day, and a base of 2 to 3 feet of the total to support a complex of buildings over a third of a mile.\" The journal Sentinel was on the job on 22 October 2018 and photographed a video of work under sunny sky. The State newspaper Wisconsin Valley News, published on 26 October 2018, stated that the site was on average 128 workers and 100 unloading trucks per day, with the crew preparing large building platforms and finalizing the first building on the site. The latest \"Wiscon Valley News\" in November 23, 2018 said about 100 trucks a day were gathering to Foxcon. In defending Foxcon's plans after the White House meeting, Goe claimed that the company was suspended in October and November 2018 because of \"ice and ice cold.\" Foxcon did not provide details of what Goo was referring to, but it is clear that there was work being done on the site throughout that time frame. The weather data from those months were inconsistent with a severe snowstorm or cold crackling that would have caused the closure of a large-scale construction project for several months.
