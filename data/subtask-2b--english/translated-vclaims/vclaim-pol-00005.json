The following day, the Fox News Political Commentator and Legal Analyst Andrew Napolitano sought to correct it. Before even asking him a question, Napolitano began his presence on October 24 in Fox and Friends, with a statement about the hearings led by the United States Republic of America Adam Schiff, D-Calif, Chairman of one of the three committees of the House of Representatives holding the hearings. \"I read the rules of the house,\" said the former judge in New Jersey. \"Though it's frustrating that these hearings take place behind closed doors -- the hearings presided over by Congressman Shiv -- they are in accordance with the rules.\" He's right. The 101 Democrats began to investigate the isolation following a reported violation report indicating that Trump withheld American military aid from Ukraine to pressure the country to investigate his political rival, Democratic Presidential candidate Joe Biden of 2020. The President may be removed if his or her actions are contrary to his or her presidential duties, whether or not they violate the Criminal Code. It is the duty of the Council to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to establish that Trump has committed a crime from which he can be isolated. First, the materials of isolation must pass through the entire United States House of Representatives by a simple majority. This material is then sent to the Senate for trial. A vote by two thirds of the senators is required to convict the President - that is, to remove him from office. Insulation is part of the Constitution of the United States. However, the rules and procedures of isolation are not written in the Constitution or in law; they are largely based on a historical precedent. After Napolitano made his statement on \"Fox and Friends,\" Napolitano went to explain that the rules for the investigation of isolation were adopted in 2015 by Republicans in the House of Representatives and allowed to conduct initial interviews of witnesses in secret, such as a criminal case brought before the grand jury. Any formal hearing of isolation must be held in public, as must the Senate trial. When we asked Fox News for information in support of Napolitano's statement, I sent the following from Napolitano: \"The rules of the House of Representatives allow committee chairpersons to hold closed meetings on matters of national security or intelligence. Diplomatic matters involve both national security and intelligence. The Rules also allow standing committees - unlike the plenary - to issue summonses. They also allow witness interviews in secret in order to determine whether they are reliable enough to appear in public.\" On January 13, 2021, Jake Taber, in his remarks on CNN, stated that Donald Trump's second presidential indictment was \"most isolated between the two parties in American history.\" According to Louis Jacobson, on January 13, 2021, his senior legal colleague at the Heritage Foundation, Hans von Spakovsky, informed us that, according to the House practice book, \"the House of Representatives usually convicts an indictment by taking a decision calling for the commission of inquiry into the charges.\" No such decision has been taken in this investigation. But the day after Napoleano met, a federal judge in Washington ruled that the investigation into the isolation was lawful. The Napoletano statement was not about the investigation in general, but whether interviews could be conducted in private. The experts agree with Napoletano Frank Bowman, Professor of Law at the University of Missouri and author of \"Senior Crimes and Misdemeanors: The History of Charges in the Tramp Age,\" who told us that hearings are not \"secret\" in that they are open to members of the three Council Committees (about 100 legislators), as well as their staff. Bowman referred to the rules of the House of 2015 that allow for cross-examination of witnesses in special isolation investigations. The Rules provide that the meetings of the Council shall be open to the public unless, in a public meeting, a committee or subcommittee, by a recorded vote, decides \"that all or part of the remainder of the meeting on that day shall be in executive session because the disclosure of the matters to be considered would endanger national security, endanger sensitive law enforcement information, tend to defamatory, defamatory or incriminate any person or otherwise violate the law or the law of the Council.\" Geoffrey Angel, Founding Director of the Presidential History Centre at the Southern Methodist University and co-author of the book Achievement: American History, emphasized the broad scope of the Council. He told Politi Vac that from a constitutional point of view, \"the Council could choose any rules it wants for dismissal hearings -- just as the Senate would be able to do the same for his trial, based on a precedent but not bound by it.\" Another point before we close. When the Republicans were in control of the house, the Benghazi Committee held almost all hearings behind closed doors, and Alan Lichtman, professor of American University history and author of the \"Isolation Issue,\" noticed us. He also noted that in the recent report of the House of Representatives on this issue, Tri Godi, a Republic of South Carolina, said \"the Committee's preference for private interviews over public hearings has been questioned. Interviews are a more efficient and effective means of detection. Interviews allow for the cross-examination of witnesses by a staff member or staff member who is highly prepared. At a hearing, each member of the Committee is recognized - usually for five minutes - a procedure that prevents in-depth and focused interrogations. Interviews also allow the Commission to protect the privacy of witnesses who may fear reprisals for cooperation or whose work requires anonymity, such as agents of the intelligence community.\" The governor, Napoletano, said: \"I read the rules of the house. Although it is frustrating that these hearings take place behind closed doors - the hearings (interrogation) chaired by Congressman Shiv - they are in accordance with the rules.\" The rules of the House of Representatives of the Council of Representatives provide broad freedom in the conduct of isolation investigations and allow for the examination of witnesses in the presence of committee members and staff members only. We appreciate that Napoleano's statement is correct.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00005"}
