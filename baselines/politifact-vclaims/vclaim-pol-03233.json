Komen for the Cure foundation, worked to pull funding for screenings performed by Planned Parenthood.\n\"In 2012, you were discussing how you led the effort to defund breast cancer screenings at Planned Parenthood,\" Ossoff said in a June 6 debate with Handel, adding that she had \"imposed her own views\" while at Komen.\nOssoff, a former congressional aide, is running against Handel in the June 20 special election in Georgia\u2019s 6th Congressional District in northern Atlanta, a historically Republican district.\nDuring the debate, Handel pushed back by saying she had been instructed to develop options for disengaging from Planned Parenthood. She downplayed her personal role in the controversial decision, adding that no single employee would have been authorized to unilaterally pull funding. The Komen foundation reversed the move after public criticism.\n\"I was directed to come up with options for how the organization could disengage,\" she said. \"It was a business decision ultimately decided by the board of Komen.\"\nWe decided to take a closer look at Ossoff\u2019s claim that Handel said she had led the effort to defund breast cancer screenings.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Boysko\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in a committee debate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe United States is the only industrialized, modernized country that does not already have a paid family medical leave program in place.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHandel did a media interview shortly after her February 2012 resignation as the Komen foundation\u2019s vice president of public policy.
