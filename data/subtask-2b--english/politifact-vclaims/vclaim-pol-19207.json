One day after Biden was sworn in as the 46th president, the domain began pulling up the White House\u2019s official website, whitehouse.gov, causing yet another stir.\n\"ATTENTION!! Go to Antifa dot com (the correct way) and it takes you to Biden's Whitehouse!!!!\" reads a popular post on Facebook. \"What is going on?? I know b4 it went to his campaign but to put WH on it! Just a slap in the face.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nHere\u2019s what is going on. The way the internet works, any person can buy an available domain name such as antifa.com and set it to redirect to another website, without any involvement from the site it\u2019s being redirected to.\u00a0\nIn this case, whoever owns the domain \u2014 and the owner remains anonymous \u2014 is purposefully redirecting it to the White House site, possibly as a joke, an oblique form of commentary, or to cause mischief or confusion. There\u2019s no evidence that Biden\u2019s campaign or administration had anything to do with it.\nThe redirect setting for antifa.com had changed several times before, forwarding to joebiden.com, kamalaharris.org, buildbackbetter.org, and a self-described anarchist website, itsgoingdown.org.\nWe did not hear back from the White House about the current redirect, but Biden\u2019s campaign denied any association with the previous antifa.com redirects.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo whoever owns https://t.co/HgEpqQ9MqZ is redirecting it to our website as a troll. What we do know was that the website was registered with a Russian registrar for a while. Odd!The VP very obviously has/wants nothing to do with fringe groups. Wish Trump could say the same.\u2014 Rob Flaherty (@Rob_Flaherty) August 31, 2020 \nAn Aug. 31, 2020, tweet from Rob Flaherty, a Biden campaign official.\n\u00a0\nComputer experts told us that redirecting a domain name is no different from forwarding a telephone number or mailing address. The person on the receiving end can\u2019t do much to stop it.\n\"Basically the way things work with domain names is, if you own a domain name, whether you\u2019re the original purchaser or you purchased it from someone else, you can redirect your domain name to anywhere you wanted it to go,\" Clifford Neuman, director of the University of Southern California\u2019s Center for Computer Systems Security, told PolitiFact in September. \"And that doesn\u2019t require permission or any or coordination from the person you are trying to redirect to.\"\nNeuman found that the antifa.com domain was first registered in 2000, and according to Whois, an online domain registry, it was last updated on Jan. 21, 2021. The registrant is listed as WhoisGuard Protected, meaning the domain owner is using a service to remain anonymous.\nThe post is partially accurate \u2014 the domain does redirect to the White House\u2019s website \u2014 but in implying that Biden\u2019s White House is involved, it leaves out important details or takes things out of context.\u00a0\nWe rate it Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19207"}
