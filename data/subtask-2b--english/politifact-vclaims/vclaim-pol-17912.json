But let\u2019s look at the photos used in this Facebook post.\u00a0\nThe first shows former NBA player Stephen Jackson at a rally in support of George Floyd, according to a story on the NBA\u2019s website. Floyd was from Houston and so was Jackson, who said they were friends. The photo caption with the story identifies Jackson as \"wearing black sunglasses\" \u2014 he\u2019s the only person visibly wearing sunglasses in the picture \u2014\u00a0as well as two players for the Minnesota Timberwolves.\nJackson published a video recording of himself in that outfit on his Instagram on June 7, and a June 11 New York Times story shows another photo of him in the hoodie, hat and sunglasses with this caption: \"Stephen Jackson has been a consistent presence at protests and news conferences in Minneapolis since George Floyd\u2019s death last month.\"\u00a0\nThe second photo does show Floyd, but it wasn\u2019t taken \"three days ago.\" News outlets started publishing it the day after his death courtesy of Benjamin Crump, the attorney for Floyd\u2019s family.\u00a0\nWe rate this Facebook post Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17912"}
