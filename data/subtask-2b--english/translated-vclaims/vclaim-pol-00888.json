The ruling now allows states to decide how to deal with sports betting, and some were quick to legitimize this practice. But Missouri wasn't one of those quick-impact countries. While some well-off people have participated in sports betting throughout the state, it remains illegal because the state has not enacted legislation to allow this. Denny Hoskins, R. Warnsburg, sponsors Senate Bill No. 44, which allows people to place bets on presidents, royalists, Cardinals and other sports teams. According to Hoskins, \"benefits for the state will include a total of $12.5 to $30.9 million.\" Hoskins reported on the estimated revenue of several news outlets throughout Missouri. In that total, the proceeds from sports include betting on mobile devices, something that not all states with legitimate sports betting allow. We wanted to know what supports Hoskins' statement that his bill will bring in $31 million in State revenue. How big is the industry? Because sports bets were not legal in the State, it was unclear how many people would participate. \"It's a gamble on how many people bet, how much bet, and how many times bet,\" said Hoskins. \"The fact is that people will gamble whether it's legal or not,\" said the sports betting expert, the predictive casino author and the predictive sports book, Andrew Pearson. \"Anyway, the casino makes for a better product.\" When we asked Hockins about his numbers, we directed us to the financial note for the bill. Haskins is a member of the Division &apos; s committee for oversight of legislative research that drafted the financial note. In order to estimate the amount of money that sports would bring, the Committee used data from Mississippi to see how it would translate into Missouri. According to Betting USA, Mississippi is the third largest betting area in the country, behind Las Vegas and Atlantic City, although online sports betting is not allowed. The financial note by Hoskins said that Mississippi's gamble committee officials charged Mississippi's total earnings from sports betting and found that sports betting revenue was 2% of its total revenue from games. The Commission assumed that the math betting in Missouri would also be 2% of its proceeds from play. If Missouri includes mobile sports betting, revenues will more than double. In view of Mississippi's expectations, the Committee expects that the State will \"bring home\" $13 million, but has not addressed the estimate of $30.9 million for Hoskins. Officials from the Missouri Gambling Commission also estimated that this project \"will increase total State revenue by approximately $13 million annually,\" but did not include the higher number of Hoskins. According to the Commission &apos; s estimates and the proposed draft law, the State will earn $6.7 million in fees and $6.3 million in taxes on wagers at a tax rate of 12 per cent, plus a fee of 2.5 per cent, bringing the total revenue to $13 million for Missouri. However, the Committee estimates that this figure will fall to $12.7 million each year thereafter, as casinos pay only \"preliminary licence fees\" for the first time that it has been decided to serve as a sports betting facility. Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" By Haley Bimeler: 26 January 2021, officials from the Revenue Department also provided an estimate of the amount of sports bets on the revenue they can bring to Missouri, assuming that online sports bets are legal, using a study, the economic impact of legal sports bets, from Oxford Economics. The American Oxford Economic Gambling Association was hired to study the potential economic impacts of legitimate sports betting in the United States. This study was used by the Ministry of Defence to measure the impact for all 50 states. The study takes into account the illegal sports betting already taking place in Missouri, together with the number of places available in Missouri to accommodate sports betting if legal. This study estimates that Missouri would be between $29,319,000 and $36,728,500. These figures support the top estimate of Hoskins. Other states that allow sports betting have a list of the seven states that currently allow sports betting (but not all of them allow online betting): Nevada Delaware New Jersey Mississippi, west of Virginia Road Island, we have taken a closer look at Pennsylvania's experience in sports betting so far to see what state revenue looks like there. Pennsylvania is a larger country with a higher tax rate on sports betting. According to Play Pennsylvania, the population of Pennsylvania spent $71.8 million in about four months. The tax rate in the state was 36%, three times the rate proposed in Missouri Doug Harbach, Director of Communications at the Gambling Control Board in Pennsylvania, said that Pennsylvania, after paying for the win, earned $1.9 million in about four months with six places all over the state to gamble with people. The financial note estimates that there are at least five locations that allow for sports betting. Harbach said that Pennsylvania's numbers are expected to jump because they \"work to launch sports bets online. Therefore, these early revenue figures are expected to escalate significantly this year.\" He also said that he could not make a judgement as to whether the expected figures for Hoskins were reasonable, but suggested that the figures for Pennsylvania should be viewed as an idea. If Pennsylvania figures do not jump, as Harbak has pointed out, the State will earn $5.7 million in sports bets in one year. This experience casts doubt on Missouri's estimates. The population of Pennsylvania is twice that of Missouri, and the tax rate is three times that proposed for Missouri, but overall estimates for the first year of sports betting are less than half of Hoskins. Our Governor, Hoskins, said, \"The benefits to the state will include a total of $12.5 million (in millions of dollars) to $30.9 million,\" if sports betting is allowed in Missouri. While it is not clear exactly how many people will participate or how many sports bets the proceeds can bring, estimates from other States do not support the upper end of the Hoskins range. However, calculations, including online sports betting, support higher estimates. We appreciate this phrase as half correct.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00888"}
