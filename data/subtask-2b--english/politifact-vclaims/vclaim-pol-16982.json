But a widely shared Facebook post claims, without evidence, that he died from something else.\u00a0\n\"I have a friend who is a friend of Joe Diffie,\" the April 13 post says. \"They labeled his death as a COVID-19 death and it wasn\u2019t! So the family asked why it was listed as the COD and the nurse told them they\u2019ve been labeling as many as they can with the virus because that\u2019s how they\u2019re getting funding. So there ya go! Now we know that the numbers are false because many who have passed didn\u2019t die from the virus, but another cause. That\u2019s how they\u2019re getting the $$$$ and that is the truth.\"\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.
