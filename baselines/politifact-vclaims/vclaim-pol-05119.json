Vote @realDonaldTrump.The only candidate that will protect your rights!\"\nThat was an opinion; we can't check it. But the declaration didn\u2019t impress Josh Perry, an aide to Sen. Cruz, who responded the day after the primary with tweets characterizing Trump as a flip-flopper on restricting assault weapons.\nCue the Flip-O-Meter. Has Trump flip-flopped on banning assault weapons?\n\"Remember when you advocated for stripping away my #2A rights?\" Perry tweeted about Trump April 6, 2016, referring to the Second Amendment to the Constitution, which says: \"A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\"\nCruz\u2019s aide earlier posted a tweet saying Trump had said: \"I support the ban on assault weapons\" and \"a slightly longer waiting period to purchase a gun.\"\nAsked to elaborate, Perry told us in a Twitter message that he\u2019d drawn Trump\u2019s comments from the businessman\u2019s 2000 book, \"The America We Deserve,\" in which Trump wrote: \"I generally oppose gun control, but I support the ban on assault weapons and I support a slightly longer waiting period to purchase a gun.\"\nThe book came out as Trump mulled a possible run for president as a third-party hopeful. At the time, a 1994 congressionally-approved ban on the sale of semi-automatic weapons was due to lapse in 2004. Democratic attempts to resurrect the restrictions have not gained traction.\nPerry also pointed out a January 2016 news post on TheIntercept.com, which says it\u2019s \"dedicated to producing fearless, adversarial journalism.\" The post contrasted Trump\u2019s support in 2000 for the assault-weapon ban and longer waiting periods with recent Trump proposals presented on his campaign website, including calls for law-abiding Americans to own the \"firearm of their choice\" and for state-issued concealed-carry permits allowing residents to carry handguns to be valid in every state. On his site, Trump also says members of the military should be able to freely carry weapons on bases and in recruiting stations.\nTrump also brings up assault-weapon restrictions, but not in a supportive way, saying: \"Gun and magazine bans are a total failure. That\u2019s been proven every time it\u2019s been tried. Opponents of gun rights try to come up with scary sounding phrases like \u2018assault weapons,\u2019 \u2018military-style weapons\u2019 and \u2018high-capacity magazines\u2019 to confuse people. What they\u2019re really talking about are popular semi-automatic rifles and standard magazines that are owned by tens of millions of Americans.\"\nThat policy position showed up on the site in September 2015, according to an ABC News story at the time, which said: \"The position on assault weapons represents a departure for Trump from a stance he held about 15 years ago.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s site includes a section on the criminal background checks that residents who purchase guns at stores must complete. In the section, Trump advocates mental health records getting tied into the system. He\u2019s silent on favoring or opposing slightly longer waiting periods before purchases are allowed though he indicates he doesn\u2019t like the background-check system, saying: \"When the system was created, gun owners were promised that it would be instant, accurate and fair. Unfortunately, that isn\u2019t the case today.\"\nIn 2016, TheIntercept.com reported, Trump \"has vowed to undo President\" Barack \"Obama\u2019s modest gun executive orders,\" per Trump\u2019s remarks at a January 2016 New Hampshire stop, and also called for the elimination of school \"gun-free zones.\" In Vermont in January, Trump said: \"I will get rid of gun-free zones on schools, and \u2014 you have to \u2014 and on military bases. My first day, it gets signed, okay? My first day. There's no more gun-free zones.\" At the time, a Washington Post news story noted Trump had repeatedly said gun-free zones are a magnet for mentally ill shooters and that mass shootings in Paris and California could have been prevented if more citizens were armed to protect themselves and others.\nWe used the text-search feature offered by Google Books to confirm Trump\u2019s gun statements in his 2000 book. In the book\u2019s brief section on guns, Trump said: \"Democrats want to confiscate all guns, which is a dumb idea because only the law-abiding citizens would turn in their guns and the bad guys would be the only ones left armed. The Republicans walk the NRA line and refuse even limited restrictions.\"\nNext, Trump wrote, \"I generally oppose gun control, but I support the ban on assault weapons and I support a slightly longer waiting period to purchase a gun. With today\u2019s Internet technology we should be able to tell within 72 hours if a potential gun owner has a record.\"\nIn a March 2016 debate, Trump was asked to speak to his published support for an assault-weapon ban. He replied: \"I don\u2019t support it anymore. I do not support the ban on assault\" weapons, he said.\nWe asked Trump\u2019s campaign if he\u2019d flip-flopped and didn\u2019t immediately hear back.\nOur ruling\nTrump supported the assault-weapon ban in 2000. He opposes restrictions now.\nWe rate this a FULL FLOP.\n\nFULL FLOP-- A major reversal of position; a complete flip-flop.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05119"}
