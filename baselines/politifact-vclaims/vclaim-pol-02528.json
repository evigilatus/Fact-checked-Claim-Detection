Critics, conversely, sometimes characterize the program as an illegal amnesty that harms the working class.\nCastro, the former San Antonio mayor and 2020 Democratic presidential prospect, directed his call for DACA action at U.S. Rep. Will Hurd, R-San Antonio, as well as John Cornyn of Texas, the Senate majority whip, who, Castro said, \"should make sure Congress passes a DREAM Act soon.\"\nCastro, who joined the faculty of the University of Texas Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs in 2017, was otherwise quoted in the post criticizing President Donald Trump for declaring the month before that his administration would discontinue DACA, which President Barack Obama launched through a 2012 memo, unless Congress authorized a program by changing federal laws. In a September 2017 tweet, Trump said both that Congress should \"legalize DACA\" and that in the event of inaction, he\u2019d \"revisit this issue.\"\nCastro cites online survey results\nSo, was Castro right about DACA recipients nearly all being in school, employed or in the military?\nCastro, asked the basis of his claim, told Josh Baugh of the San Antonio Express-News by text that he drew his data points from an August 2017 web post by the left-leaning Center for American Progress about a national DACA survey.\nThat survey, we found, asked if DACA recipients had jobs or were in school. It didn\u2019t ask if respondents were in the military.\nThe center\u2019s post summarizing the results said Tom Wong, a political scientist at the University of California, San Diego, led the August 2017 survey of 3,063 DACA recipients. All told, the post says, the survey reached DACA recipients in 46 states including Texas, where 17 percent of respondents said they were living, according to the center\u2019s separate post of the survey\u2019s 22 questions and tallied results.\nLet\u2019s check on whether the results back up Castro\u2019s claim before turning to the survey methodology and other efforts to gauge how DACA recipients spend their lives.\nSurvey results\nAsked if they were \"currently employed,\" 91.4 percent answered affirmatively, according to the results, with 55.9 percent of those respondents saying they hadn\u2019t been employed \"before DACA.\" Another question asked if the respondent was currently in school; 44.9 percent responded affirmatively with 55 percent saying not, according to the results.\nWong told us by email that an additional sort of the \"in school\" and \"currently employed\" responses showed 97 percent of all respondents reporting being employed or enrolled in school \u2014 with 71.5 percent of those saying that they were in school reportedly pursuing a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher.\nMethodology\nThe center said in its post that the results drew on the largest sampling of DACA recipients to date. Some perspective: the 3,000-plus respondents would have amounted to about 4/10ths of 1 percent of some 690,000 active DACA recipients reported at about that time by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.\nWong conducted the survey in collaboration with the center and advocacy groups United We Dream and the National Immigration Law Center. At the survey\u2019s release, that teaming drew criticism on the right-leaning Breitbart blog, where writer Neil Munro underscored an acknowledgment in the survey\u2019s methodology section that \"it is not possible to construct a valid margin of error\" for the results because \"there is no phone book of undocumented immigrants.\" Munro counted this as an admission that the data was unreliable.\nIn the same vein, we wondered how Wong\u2019s team confirmed that respondents were signed up for DACA; best we could tell, beneficiaries are not revealed by the government.\nBy phone, Wong reaffirmed the methodology described in the center\u2019s post about the survey including that the partnering entities recruited the recipients surveyed online. Specifically, Wong said, the partners sent a web link to the survey to individuals on their respective email lists, also employing Facebook ads to ensure that self-identified DACA recipients from all over the country could participate.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecognizing that non-DACA recipients could potentially click through the survey, the researchers reported taking steps to eliminate bias and other factors that might skew the results.\nIn the write-up posted by the center, Wong and his co-authors said that to prevent people from submitting multiple responses, they used a survey platform that prevented an IP address from submitting multiple responses.\nWong said he used another tactic to stop people from gaming the study: Near the beginning of the survey, each respondent was asked to say at which age she or he came to the U.S. Close to the end, the survey requested the year the respondent came to the U.S. If the age provided toward the survey\u2019s start matched the year offered later, the results stayed in. If off by more than a year, Wong said, he threw out the response. In the end, he said, the responses of 3,063 people were tallied--with approximately 6,000 respondents\u2019 surveys getting set aside for one reason or another.\nWe asked Wong to provide more detail perhaps enabling us to confirm the percentages in the results. Wong told us by email that he hadn\u2019t talked to the study\u2019s outreach partners \"about what data can and can\u2019t be released.\" Wong also said he plans to write a book analyzing the first four years of his survey results, at which point the data he analyzes for the book will be made publicly available. \"I know talk isn\u2019t worth much, but I analyzed all of the data myself and stand by the results,\" Wong wrote.\nSolid research, expert says\nWe separately asked Ernesto Casta\u00f1eda, an American University expert on migration research, if he considers the Wong-led results to be valid.\nCasta\u00f1eda\u2019s answer: Yes. Wong and his colleagues \"carried out a valid study on a hard-to-reach population,\" Casta\u00f1eda said by email. \"With more than three thousand respondents, this is an exceptionally large sample size.\" Casta\u00f1eda further said that researchers cannot always calculate margins of error for \"unknown populations\" like homeless and undocumented people, adding that the authors \"took a number of steps to avoid duplicates or dubious data.\"\nCasta\u00f1eda told us too that the study\u2019s results appeared to be consistent with ethnographic research on DACA recipients and survey and interview research through 2016 by Roberto Gonzales, a Harvard University expert on immigration and social inequality, suggesting that DACA recipients made gains after getting that designation.\nWong and Gonzales each found DACA beneficiaries finding educational and career opportunities that had been closed to them before they entered the program. According to Gonzales\u2019 study, posted by the center in June 2017, \"DACA beneficiaries told the authors that they were able to match their education and training with work that was meaningful to them\u2014\u2018an occupation that they could be proud of and that did not carry the stigma of \u2018immigrant work.\u2019 \" Wong told us a result from his 2017 study stood out to him: 54.2 percent of respondents reported getting a job \"that better fits my education and training.\"\nIn the Breitbart post critical of Wong\u2019s work, Munro wrote that the study was \"based on a skewed sample of relatively successful DACA illegals who were identified by advocacy groups.\"\nTo Munro\u2019s point, 35.5 percent of respondents 25 and older reported having bachelor\u2019s degrees or higher. Seemingly in contrast, Munro noted, an August 2017 Migration Policy Institute study found only 5 percent of the \"immediately eligible DACA population\" holding a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher. The institute, a think tank that says it believes in the benefits of well-managed immigration, reached its \"5 percent\" figure by drawing on responses to the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s 2014 American Community Survey.\nWong, asked about the possibly too-high education levels suggested by his results, pointed out that the 35.5 percent of survey-indicated DACA recipients with bachelor\u2019s degrees came out only slightly greater than what\u2019s lately shown for naturalized American citizens. According to bureau data from 2016, 35.2 percent of naturalized citizens \u2014 those who obtained citizenship after being born as non-citizens \u2014 reported having a bachelor\u2019s, graduate or professional degree.\nDACA recipients\u2019 high education levels make sense, Wong said, because the program requires applicants to be currently in school, have graduated from high school, have obtained a General Education Development (GED) certificate, or be an honorably discharged Coast Guard or military veteran.\n\"We\u2019re actually requiring them to be more educated than the general population,\" Wong said, adding: \"Now that the DACA population is getting older, we\u2019re talking about a pretty sizable number of college-educated individuals who are just beginning to hit their strides in their careers.\"\nCasta\u00f1eda suggested by email that Wong\u2019s survey provided more meaningful results than the MPI study, which was concerned with many more residents including individuals unlikely to seek DACA status. Casta\u00f1eda wrote: \"DACA recipients are by definition positively self-selected since they have to apply to the program, deal with the complex application process and requirements, and pay application fees.\"\nAnother view\nWe also asked Jessica Vaughan of the conservative-leaning Center for Immigration Studies to evaluate the survey cited by Castro.\nBy phone, Vaughan told us that she would not be surprised that DACA recipients participate in the labor force at high rates because for many, employment was likely \"a motivating factor to apply for DACA.\" Vaughan speculated, though, that the survey overstated the employment and education rates of DACA recipients simply by being administered online and, she suggested, drawing from people with regular online access as well as individuals with the \"time and inclination to fill out such a survey.\" It\u2019s reasonable, she said, to suppose that the same people would be more likely employed and well-educated.\nOur ruling\nCastro said a \"recent analysis\" showed that 91 percent of DACA recipients are employed, in school or serving in the military.\nSome 97 percent of respondents to an August 2017 online survey reported being employed or in school. However, the researchers asked no questions about military service.\nWe rate this claim Mostly True.\n\nMOSTLY TRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.
