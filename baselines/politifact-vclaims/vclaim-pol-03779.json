Mark Pocan, D-Madison, offered up a defense built on the city\u2019s economic muscle.\nThe spat began when U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy, a Republican, referred to the \"progressive, liberal, communist community of Madison\" while discussing how Dane County opted for a hand tally during the presidential recount. The comments came in a December appearance on Tucker Carlson Tonight on Fox News.\nDuffy implied on Twitter he was joking, but Pocan wasn\u2019t laughing. The Democrat went on the same show Dec. 8, 2016, to demand an apology and defend the state\u2019s capital city.\n\"In the last decade, 73 percent of new jobs (in Wisconsin) have come from Madison,\" Pocan said in the appearance. \"I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s exactly the way I look at communists. We actually have a very vibrant private sector.\"\nIs one Wisconsin city really responsible for nearly three-fourths of the job growth over the last 10 years? Let's check the numbers.\nProblems with geography, specificity\nThe claim runs into immediate trouble since Pocan referred to the wrong geographic area.\nSpokesman David Kolovson said Pocan meant to say Dane County was responsible for 73% of jobs, not Madison. He noted two news releases Pocan issued on the topic attributed that number to Dane County.\nSlightly more than half of Dane County lives outside Madison, so it\u2019s an important difference.\nPocan also referred on TV to \"73 percent of new jobs,\" when the figures he is citing actually address net job growth.\nPocan\u2019s phrasing implies he has data on where each new job in the state was created, when he is actually referring to the change in total employment \u2014 how many people had jobs at one point in time compared to another.\nJob figures don\u2019t match Pocan\u2019s claim\nAs for the 73 percent figure, let\u2019s first look at what Pocan actually said \u2014 that the City of Madison was responsible for 73 percent of growth.\nThe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates Madison added a net of 13,000 jobs from 2006-\u201916, while the state added 87,000. That would be 15 percent of the statewide growth \u2014 far less than Pocan asserted.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThose numbers come from the bureau\u2019s Local Area Unemployment Statistics, which uses household-level data and surveys to estimate the labor force, employment and unemployment numbers. It\u2019s the only dataset with city-level data.\nBut what about the number Pocan was intending to cite (and did cite in news releases), attributing the increase to Dane County?\nIt\u2019s closer, but still off.\nBureau of Labor Statistics Economist Steve Hipple said a different dataset, Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, is the best measure of job growth. That is based on state unemployment insurance filings and produces county and state-level employment figures.\nThe latest available employment data, through the second quarter of 2016, shows Dane County is responsible for 58 percent of the state\u2019s job growth from 2006-\u201916.\nDan Kennelly, manager of Madison\u2019s Office of Business Resources, said the number is that high largely due to the Great Recession. Dane County was significantly less affected than the rest of the state, he said.\n\"If you look at more recent years, the statewide numbers look significantly stronger compared to Dane County,\" Kennelly said. \"This is likely because while Dane County\u2019s economy stayed relatively strong through the recession, the statewide economy took a bigger dive and therefore had a deeper hole to climb out of during the recovery over the last few years.\"\nKolovson, the Pocan spokesman, said the 73 percent figure came from a presentation made by Madison city development officials at a September 2014 symposium. That presentation said 73 percent of \"net new jobs\" created in Wisconsin from 2004-\u201914 were in Dane County.\nSo the data is at least two years old, and not in line with Pocan\u2019s reference to it as being \"in the last decade.\" And the number is wrong for that timespan anyhow.\nKennelly, who did the calculations behind the 73 percent figure, said he used the same Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages. But the symposium occurred with three months left in 2014.\nFull-year data for 2004-14 shows Dane County accounted for 55 percent of the job growth statewide in that span.\nOur rating\nIn his defense of Madison, Pocan highlighted the area\u2019s job creation by saying the city is responsible for 73 percent of new jobs in the state over the last decade.\nBut his claim attributed Dane County data to Madison, referred to \"new jobs\" when he meant job growth and was built on two-year-old data that is wrong itself.\nWe rate his claim False.
