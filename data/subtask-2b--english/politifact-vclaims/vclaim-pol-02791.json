Scripps television:", "title": "Once again, Trump overstates U.S. tax ranking", "text": "As he presses for sweeping tax reform, President Donald Trump continues to paint the nation\u2019s current tax burden in superlative colors. And he continues to struggle to get it right.\nIn an interview, Mike Sacks, national political correspondent for E.W. Scripps, brought this up with Trump. Here\u2019s that exchange:\nSacks: \"You've repeatedly said that we're the highest taxed nation in the world when that's been seen as objectively false. With the credibility you need to pass tax reform, why --\"\nTrump: \"Some people say it differently, they say we're the highest developed nation taxed in the world.\"\nSacks: \"Then why don't you say it that way?\"\nTrump: \"Because a lot of people know exactly what i'm talking about, and in many cases they think I\u2019m right when I say the highest. As far as I'm concerned I think we're really essentially the highest, but if you want to add the \u2018developed nation,\u2019 you can say that, too. But a lot of people agree that the way I'm saying it is exactly correct.\"\nDoes adding the \"developed nation\" label make the claim more accurate?\nNo.\nWhen Trump has said before that America has the highest corporate tax rate, he\u2019s on pretty firm ground and we\u2019ve rated him Mostly True. The statutory tax rate for corporations is 35 percent, the highest among countries like Japan, Mexico, Australia, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and other European nations.\nNow to be clear, the tax rate on paper and the effective tax rate are two different things.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks to the thousands of deductions and exemptions in state and federal tax codes, according to a 2016 Government Accountability Office report, the effective average corporate tax is 22 percent. That puts the country in the middle of the pack among our economic peers.\nAs for the tax burden across the board for individuals and companies alike, economists generally rely on a couple of yardsticks. One is the total tax burden compared to the size of the economy and the other is the tax burden per person.\nThe most recent numbers come from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development for 2015. The countries it compares include the group that are generally seen as \"developed nations.\"\nAs a percentage of GDP, the U.S. tax burden -- covering all levels of government -- ranks 28th out of 32 countries. We ran the numbers based on federal revenues alone, and the rankings stayed about the same.\nOn a per-person basis, America ranks 13th out of 31 nations.\nWe asked the White House if they had other numbers. We didn\u2019t hear back, but if we do, we\u2019ll update this fact-check.\nOur ruling\nTrump said that the United States is \"the highest developed nation taxed in the world.\"\nLooking at tax collections relative to the size of the U.S. economy and the number of people, the numbers tell a different story. The United States ranks 28th in tax revenues as a percentage of GDP and 13th on a per-capita basis.\nTrump said his view is \"exactly correct.\"\nIn fact, it is exactly incorrect.\nWe rate this claim False.\n Share the Facts 2017-10-18 21:29:02 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  \"We're the highest developed nation taxed in the world.\"    Donald Trump President of the United States https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F79xhiHftyg   In an interview with E.W.
