(Gingrich did not respond to us.)\nTo measure the accuracy of Gingrich\u2019s comment, we isolated the largest 50 U.S. cities using 2012 U.S. Census Bureau data. We then calculated the percentage of people in each city who are living below the federal poverty line, thanks to this Governing magazine report that relied on Census Bureau data.\nFrom there, we created a list of the 20 biggest U.S. cities with the largest percentage of people living below the federal poverty level (about $11,500 for one person).\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd finally, we researched the political party of the mayor in each city.\nComparing poverty rates and political affiliation in large U.S. cities\n\n\n\nCity\n% of people below poverty level\nMayor\nPolitical party\n\n\nDetroit, MI\n42.3\nDavid Bing\nDemocrat\n\n\nCleveland, OH\n36.1\nFrank Jackson\nDemocrat\n\n\nMiami, FL\n31.7\nTom\u00e1s Regalado\nRepublican\n\n\nFresno, CA\n31.5\nAshley Swearengin\nRepublican\n\n\nMilwaukee, WI\n29.9\nTom Barrett\nDemocrat\n\n\nMemphis, TN\n28.3\nA C Wharton\nDemocrat\n\n\nPhiladelphia, PA\n26.9\nMichael Nutter\nDemocrat\n\n\nTucson, AZ\n26.7\nJonathan Rothschild\nDemocrat\n\n\nAtlanta, GA\n25.8\nKasim Reed\nDemocrat\n\n\nBaltimore, MD\n24.8\nStephanie Rawlings-Blake\nDemocrat\n\n\nPhoenix, AZ\n24.1\nGreg Stanton\nDemocrat\n\n\nChicago, IL\n23.9\nRahm Emanuel\nDemocrat\n\n\nDallas, TX\n23.9\nMike Rawlings\nDemocrat\n\n\nHouston, TX\n23.5\nAnnise Parker\nDemocrat\n\n\nSacramento, CA\n23.4\nKevin Johnson\nDemocrat\n\n\nLos Angeles, CA\n23.3\nEric Garcetti\nDemocrat\n\n\nLong Beach, CA\n22.9\nBob Foster\nDemocrat\n\n\nEl Paso, TX\n22.8\nOscar Leeser\nDemocrat\n\n\nMinneapolis, MN\n22.7\nR.T.

Current New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has served as both a Republican and an independent.\nUniversity of Michigan population studies professor Sheldon Danziger suggested analyzing state poverty levels and matching those with governors\u2019 political ties would be more accurate than honing in on cities.\nLike we said at the outset, we\u2019re staying away from drawing conclusions about poverty in U.S. cities and the political affiliation of their elected leader. We\u2019re simply analyzing the statistics behind Gingrich\u2019s comment.\nOur ruling\nGingrich emphasized that every major, poor U.S. city is run by Democrats. We found two cities in the top 5 poorest, and three in the top 20, that have Republicans at the helm. Yes, most cities on the list are led by Democrats, but Gingrich said \"every.\" As such, we rate his statement Mostly False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4cfba731-6fa6-4ffe-8c24-c2fc2ae43b57", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08502"}
