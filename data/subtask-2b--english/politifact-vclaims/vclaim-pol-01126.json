The resulting lapse in federal appropriations has shuttered many parts of the government, including some food-safety inspections handled by the Food and Drug Administration.\nThe assertion was amplified when a Hollywood writer tweeted it the following day.\n\"Last year lettuce killed more Americans than undocumented immigrants so it's a good thing we're halting food inspections over a wall that won't work,\" tweeted Ally Maynard, a television producer with 80,500 followers. It inspired at least 67,000 retweets and 209,000 likes through Jan. 15.\nLast year lettuce killed more Americans than undocumented immigrants so it's a good thing we're halting food inspections over a wall that won't work.\u2014 Ally Maynard (@missmayn) January 10, 2019\n\nSocial media users wondered if what she wrote was accurate. Some searched the Centers for Disease Control looking for more information.\nWe decided to help everyone out.\nHow many people died of foodborne illnesses from lettuce in 2018?\nThe number appears to be at least five.\nThere were two high-profile E. Coli outbreaks from romaine lettuce in 2018. The first, in May 2018, resulted in five deaths and at least 210 illnesses, about half of which resulted in hospitalizations. The second, in November, resulted in a few dozen illnesses but no reported deaths.\nDon\u2019t assume that the nonfatal illnesses were minor, however.\nE. coli O157:H7, the pathogen involved in these outbreaks, \"can cause a life-threatening complication called hemolytic uremic syndrome among the very young or elderly,\" said Craig Hedberg, a University of Minnesota epidemiologist. There were 27 such cases in the first outbreak, and two in the second.\nHow many people were killed by undocumented immigrants in 2018?\nAs for undocumented immigrants and crime, let\u2019s start with the big picture: They have been found to be no more likely than U.S.-born individuals to take part in crime.\nOne study published earlier this year by sociologists from the University of Wisconsin and Purdue University, for instance, concluded that \"undocumented immigration does not increase violence.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd there\u2019s a bigger body of academic research that suggests that immigrants, regardless of legal status, are no more likely to commit criminal acts than native-born Americans, said Christopher P. Salas-Wright, an assistant professor at Boston University\u2019s School of Social Work.\n\"We continue to find that areas with higher concentrations of immigrants have lower violent crime rates,\" said Charis E. Kubrin, a University of California-Irvine criminologist, citing a recent paper\u00a0she wrote.\n\nKubrin added that for the most part, studies find that people who migrate are a self-selecting group who want to better their lives, provide for their families back in their home countries and don\u2019t want to risk getting in trouble with the law.\nThere were some high-profile examples in 2018 of undocumented immigrants being charged with homicide. One was Cristhian Bahena Rivera, a farmhand who was charged with murdering 20-year-old University of Iowa student Mollie Tibbetts. Another was Gustavo Perez Arriaga, who was charged with killing police officer Ronil Singh in Newman, Calif. Neither case has been adjudicated yet.\nBut while anecdotes exist, hard data about killings by undocumented immigrants is hard to find. As we\u2019ve noted previously, it is not a statistic that is calculated on a national basis. So the best we can manage is guesswork.\nWe know that there have recently been about 19,000 homicides every year in the United States, and presumably some fraction of them have been committed by undocumented immigrants.\nComparing the estimated size of the undocumented immigrant population (10.7 million) and the full U.S. population (327 million), the roughest possible calculation would suggest that about 600 of those homicides would have been committed by undocumented immigrants per year.\nThat\u2019s not far off another data point we have \u2014 the number of convictions of illegal immigrants for homicides in Texas.\nCato Institute senior immigration policy analyst Alex Nowrasteh pointed to a Texas Department of Public Safety website that reported 238 homicide convictions of undocumented immigrants between June 1, 2011, and Dec. 31, 2018. Based on his communications with the agency, Nowrasteh was able to pinpoint 39 convictions that occurred in Texas in 2018. These are convictions for homicides that occurred in a variety of years, so it\u2019s not perfectly comparable, but it\u2019s a rough estimate.\nIf you prorate Texas\u2019s 39 homicide convictions to the country as a whole \u2014 simply using population \u2014 it works out to 445 nationally.\nAs we\u2019ve emphasized, these are back-of-the-envelope calculations. But even if these estimates \u2014 a couple hundred homicides by undocumented immigrants \u2014 are high by a factor of 10, they almost certainly outpaced the five lettuce deaths in 2018.\nHow a slight change in wording could dramatically change the calculation\nSo the statement that rocketed around social media is wrong. But a small change in wording could have made a big difference.\nIf the statement had used the word \"food\" rather than \"lettuce,\" it might well have been correct. (This is also a fuller description of what the FDA inspects anyway.)\nA 2011 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention used models to estimate the annual number of deaths due to 31 pathogens to be 2,612, or 1,351 if you include only domestically acquired foodborne illnesses.\nEither figure would be larger than the estimate of couple hundred deaths every year at the hands of undocumented immigrants. (These numbers are also larger than the number of confirmed deaths from foodborne illness in recent years, but that is generally chalked up to gaps in reporting and medical uncertainties about what actually led to a person\u2019s death.)\nFor her part, Maynard told PolitiFact that her comparison \"was definitely meant in jest,\" and that finding hard data on the question was difficult.\nOur ruling\nThe meme said, \"Lettuce killed more Americans this year than undocumented immigrants.\"\nTo the best we can tell from imperfect data, that\u2019s incorrect. However a small tweak -- changing the term to \"food,\" which is the FDA\u2019s full responsibility -- would likely have supported the meme\u2019s point. On its own, we rate the statement False.\n Share the Facts 2019-01-15 20:59:32 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  \"Lettuce killed more Americans this year than undocumented immigrants.\"    Viral image on the Internet https://www.facebook.com/reallypoliticked/photos/a.398231337048228/934340606770629/?type=3&theater   a meme Wednesday, January 9, 2019 2019-01-09    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01126"}
