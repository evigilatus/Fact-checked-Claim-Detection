Trump\u2019s claim about \u2018affordable\u2019 options", "text": "In his wide-ranging State of the Union address, President Donald Trump returned to a favorite theme: the cost of health insurance.\nHe cited the high cost of premiums for people who buy their coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces and said his administration has provided new, less costly coverage.\n\"I moved quickly to provide affordable alternatives. Our new plans are up to 60% less expensive and better,\" Trump told the lawmakers gathered at the Capitol.\nSo we wondered, to which new alternatives was he referring? We reached out to the White House to ask.\nSpokesperson Adam Kennedy responded that the president was talking about short-term, limited-duration plans. But that got us thinking: Are they really less expensive and better? Or simply better than nothing?\u00a0\nFirst, are they new?\nThey are not. As background, short-term insurance plans have been around for decades in various iterations and are generally considered a stopgap solution for people between jobs or attending school. They provide some protections, usually paying a percentage of hospital and doctor bills after the policyholder meets a deductible.\nBut they\u2019ve always been a bit controversial.\nUnlike the ACA plans now available, short-term plans can bar people with health conditions from enrolling or exclude coverage for specific conditions or treatments. They also offer fewer benefits \u2014 meaning they are not required to comply with the health law\u2019s mandated essential benefits requirement.\nSo, for example, they don\u2019t have to cover prescription drugs, or mental health services or substance abuse treatment \u2014 and many don\u2019t. In addition, they can set annual or lifetime caps on benefits. Almost all exclude maternity care.\nIf a person develops a health condition during the coverage term, insurers can look through their medical records and, in some cases, retroactively cancel the plans \u2014 or refuse to renew the coverage at the end of the policy\u2019s term.\nThe Obama administration restricted these policies, which still cannot be sold on the ACA marketplaces and do not qualify for subsidies, to a maximum coverage period of 90 days, down from the 364 days that applied previously.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Trump administration reversed that time-limit restriction in 2018 and built on it by allowing insurers to offer policies renewable for up to three years.\nOfficials, including Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, said at the time that these short-term plans provide an alternative but aren\u2019t a good fit for everyone.\nFor instance, the Trump rules require the policies to carry a warning that they aren\u2019t \"required to comply with federal requirements for health insurance.\" They also state that consumers should \"check the policy carefully to make sure you understand what the policy does and doesn\u2019t cover.\"\nAre these plans less expensive?\nThe White House pointed us toward a January 2019 report produced by the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation as the source for the president\u2019s assertion that these plans are 60% less expensive.\nIt quickly becomes clear that the analysis is very wonky and complex.\nAfter all, it\u2019s not easy to project what benefits insurers will include in short-term plans or what they will charge individuals, which can vary based on their health. Even the analysts called the estimating process \"challenging.\"\u00a0\nWhen it came right down to it, they hedged: Short-term plans are likely cheaper than the lowest-cost ACA plan for some consumers, but more expensive for others. For example, people who get a federal tax credit to buy ACA-compliant insurance or those who are older or less healthy would likely pay more in premiums for a traditional short-term plan, the analysts said.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConversely, those without subsidies, especially younger or healthier consumers, might pay as much as 60% less than they would for the lowest-cost plan through the ACA, the analysis concluded. Another study, not cited by the White House but done by the conservative Manhattan Institute, also listed caveats, but more robustly defended the plans as less expensive. Premiums for short-term plans are lower \u2014 in some cases, almost half the cost \u2014 of ACA plans, it concluded.\nBut critics put these price tags in context. \"I don\u2019t have a reason to suspect the 60% is wrong if they\u2019re lining them up against ACA plans, but if you\u2019re a health plan that doesn\u2019t cover much, it\u2019s easy enough to offer a cheap premium,\" said Sabrina Corlette, research professor and co-director of the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University.\nSo that gets to the question, are they better?\nThe consensus is that the coverage short-term plans provide is not better than that of ACA plans. But it could be better than going without insurance entirely.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\"Why not throw another option out there?\" said Doug Badger, senior fellow at the conservative Galen Institute. \"You might say this plan isn\u2019t as good as that plan, but we may both agree that having this one is better than nothing.\"\nHe said that should be a decision made by consumers, who can weigh the pros and cons: \"They know their circumstances and risk tolerance.\".\nStill, it\u2019s a gamble, as no one knows what health conditions might befall them. A plan that doesn\u2019t cover prescription drugs may be fine the first month, but if a serious illness crops up, it suddenly has unexpected costs.\nOthers also note that short-term plans may have wider networks of doctors and hospitals than some ACA plans, giving consumers more options.\n\"In Texas, for example, you cannot buy an ACA plan that covers MD Anderson,\" the cancer center of the University of Texas, said Brian Blase, CEO of Blase Policy Strategies. Blase has advised Trump on his health policy efforts. \"The only way you can have such a plan that includes MD Anderson \u2014 unless you have employer coverage \u2014 is in a short-term plan.\"\nAgain, nice to have a wide network. But there\u2019s a conundrum. Someone with cancer \u2014 attracted to a network because it includes MD Anderson \u2014 would be rejected by most short-term plans.\nThat ability to reject applicants \u2014 or seriously limit coverage of their preexisting conditions \u2014 helps keep premiums down.\nBut those are also the main reasons experts say the plans are not better than those offered under the ACA, which bars such limits.\nA preexisting condition is often defined as anything treated \u2014 or for which a \"prudent person\" should have sought treatment \u2014 during the previous 12 months to five years, depending on the insurer.\n\"If you have high blood pressure and, while on one of these plans, you have a heart attack, the plan could say that was a preexisting condition,\" said Corlette.\nState regulation of such plans varies widely, as do the coverage benefits and limits offered by various insurers. Some have limits listed in the fine print.\nWhile short-term plans have been embraced by regulators in some states, nearly half of all states have moved to limit them to less than 12 months. Four \u2014 California, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York \u2014 have barred them altogether.\u00a0\u00a0\nThose states cite concerns about the effect on ACA premiums and the risk that consumers could be left hanging by the more limited nature of the short-term plans.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nTrump said these are new plans that are 60% cheaper and better.\nBut short-terms plans are not a new idea. Just how much cheaper they are depends on a lot of factors, experts told us. And it\u2019s very hard to examine them in an apples-to-apples comparison with ACA plans, which cover far more and are required to accept all applicants.\nGiven the limitations of short-term plans, they\u2019re not better than ACA plans for most people, because policyholders could face potentially significant financial risk \u2014 or find their treatment needs are not covered. They\u2019re definitely not better for people who qualify for federal subsidies to buy ACA insurance, especially those at the lower end of that income range, where the subsidies are larger.\nThat said, a short-term plan may be better than going without coverage at all, particularly for a young or otherwise healthy person, whose income is above subsidy limits.\nWe rate this claim as Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17368"}
