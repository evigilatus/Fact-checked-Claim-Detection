But is it any more accurate about \"Romney\u2019s investments\" than it was about Obama\u2019s stimulus package?\n\nUh, no.\n\nRomney made a personal fortune running private equity and venture capital firm Bain Capital, and super PACs are spending millions to show investments that ended with lost jobs and Bain profits.\n\nThat\u2019s an incomplete snapshot of Bain\u2019s portfolio \u2014 in fact, at least several of Bain's companies mushroomed, creating thousands of jobs.\n\nStill, the ads and mailers keep coming, like this one the week of Sept. 17, 2012, from a super PAC associated with the union AFL-CIO.\n\nThe mailer, spotted by POLITICO, calls Romney\u2019s business model at private equity firm Bain Capital \"un-American.\"\n\nIt offered a chart titled \"Mitt Romney by the numbers,\" which included this:\n\n\"0: Number of jobs that Romney\u2019s investments created.\"\n\nZero?\n\nA footnote says the source is a May 21, 2012, article published by Businessweek.com.\n\nEddie Vale, communications director for Workers\u2019 Voice, pointed us to the final paragraphs of a BloombergBusinessweek story titled \"Mitt Romney's Private Equity Nightmare.\"\n\nThe story paraphrases a former Romney colleague at Bain as saying, \"the main goal at buyout firms ... is never maximizing employment. ... It\u2019s maximizing returns for investors.\"\n\nVale said that was the point of the chart.\n\n\"The goal of Romney\u2019s investments was to maximize profits, not create jobs. We are not saying he never created a job. He needs people to feed his dressage horse and wash his cars,\" Vale said. \"We are saying his investments were about maximizing profit. He did that by laying off workers and sending jobs overseas.\"\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean Romney\u2019s investments created \"0\" jobs.\n\n Private equity vs. venture capital\n\nIn fact, sometimes Bain profits and jobs grew together.\n\nRomney has repeatedly claimed that Bain was a job creator.\n\n\"In the business I had, we invested in over 100 different businesses and net-net, taking out the ones where we lost jobs and those that we added, those businesses have now added over 100,000 jobs.\"\n\nIndependent journalists, including us, haven\u2019t been able to confirm that \"net-net\" Bain investments added 100,000 jobs. Bain won\u2019t release enough information to do the math.\n\nBut here are some things we do know. Sometimes Bain acted as a private equity firm, buying stakes in businesses, taking out loans to retool the companies and pay themselves fees, then selling their stakes at a profit. Thousands of workers lost their jobs.\n\nBut some studies show that private equity in general results in minimal net job loss. Companies shed jobs, but mostly make it up with hiring later.\n\nThen there are the times that Bain acted as a venture capitalist, investing in young companies to help them grow. (Something that generally requires hiring workers, not laying them off.) That\u2019s the case for companies like Staples, an example Romney loves to cite. And for good reason.\n\nHere are the most widely reported Bain job gains and losses, as rounded up by FactCheck.org from POLITICO and the New York Times:\n\n\u2022 Romney's campaign says three companies in which Bain invested alone have created more than 100,000 jobs: Staples (89,000), Sports Authority (15,000) and Domino's (7,900 jobs added since 1999). That's 111,900 jobs.\n\n(Two of those were venture capital investments; Domino\u2019s was a private equity buyout.)\n\n\u2022 Companies that lost jobs include American Pad & Paper (385), Dade International (1,900), DDi Corp. (2,100), Clear Channel Communications (2,500) and KB Toys (3,400). That's 10,285 jobs.\n\nOther roundups with a narrower time frame \u2014 the years before Romney retired \u2014 also show tens of thousands of new jobs, and fewer job losses.\n\nNone of these tallies is comprehensive. There\u2019s also a fair question whether Romney deserves credit for all jobs gained \u2014 or blame for jobs lost. Some commentators say the issue isn\u2019t that Bain companies shed jobs, but that they shed \"good jobs.\" But this ad went way beyond that thoughtful criticism. It said his investments\u2019 job creation was zero.\n\n Our ruling\n\nWorkers\u2019 Voice says the \"number of jobs that Romney\u2019s investments created\" is zero. That ignores Bain\u2019s role as a venture capital firm that helped build companies that hired tens of thousands of workers.\n\nThe PAC, unable to provide data to back up its claim, said the goal of Romney\u2019s investments wasn\u2019t jobs, but profits. That doesn\u2019t prove Bain\u2019s job creation was zero. Nor do examples of Romney investments that lost jobs. This catchy claim comes up empty. We rate it Pants on Fire.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H.
