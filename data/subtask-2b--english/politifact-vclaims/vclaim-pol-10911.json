Mike Turner, a career firefighter, and Principal Roxie Ross, a lifelong educator, held a press conference call at 2 p.m. responding to Mitt Romney\u2019s claim that we don\u2019t need \u2018more firemen, more policemen, more teachers\u2019 ahead of a Romney fundraiser in Williamson County.\"\n\nOf course, Republicans often criticize \"big government\" and sometimes portray government workers as overpaid, but it\u2019s rare to see any politician single out a specific set of workers -- particularly firefighters and police officers. Noting that the TNDP isolated a phrase in quotes, we wondered if Romney\u2019s words might have been taken out of context.\n\nTNDP communications director Brandon Puttbrese responded to our inquiry with links to news articles about Romney\u2019s comments, made just after Wisconsin Republican Gov. Scott Walker won the recall election.\n\nHere is the full Romney quote from which the TNDP lifted the remarks. Romney is referring to President Obama\u2019s call for more spending to boost the public sector: \"He wants another stimulus, he wants to hire more government workers. He says we need more firemen, more policemen, more teachers. Did he not get the message of Wisconsin? The American people did. It's time for us to cut back on government and help the American people.\"\n\nWe note that Romney did not say there should be \"fewer\" policemen, firemen and teachers, but the full context of the quote makes clear he disagreed with Obama\u2019s stated policy goal of having Congress appropriate more stimulus money to add more of them. The more accurate characterization of Romney\u2019s remarks would have been that \"Romney disagrees with President Obama\u2019s goal of adding \u2018more firemen, more policemen, more teachers,\u2019 \" though we recognize that doesn\u2019t have the same zing as the TNDP\u2019s wording.\n\nRomney\u2019s quote came at the same event in Iowa in which he criticized Obama for saying that \"the private sector is doing fine.\"\n\nObama's private sector comment was part of a longer discussion in which he argued the massive public sector job losses have been a drag on an economy that has otherwise steadily added private sector jobs. Romney has pushed back, suggesting that it is an overweight public sector that is shackling the private sector.\n\nOne point worth noting here is that Walker has responded to the Obama-Romney tete a tete by defending his own record when it comes to firemen, policemen and teachers. He said recently: \"I know in my state our reforms allowed us to protect firefighters, police officers and teachers. That's not what I think of when I think of big government.\"\n\nOur check of other Romney comments found that he has typically been critical of government workers in general without specifying workers such as cops and firefighters: \"That stimulus he [President Obama] put in place \u2014 it didn\u2019t help private sector jobs, it helped preserve government jobs. And the one place we should have shut back \u2014 or cut back \u2014 was on government jobs.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nThe Tennessee Democratic Party says Mitt Romney has said \"we don't need 'more firemen, more policemen, more teachers.' \"\n\nThat's a slight exaggeration of Romney's remarks -- he was responding to Obama's comments on them, not outlining his own specific policy against them. Still, that's pretty close to what Romney said. We rate the claim Mostly True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10911"}
