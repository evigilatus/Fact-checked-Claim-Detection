We're gonna load it up. You're gonna get a lot of equipment. Believe me.\" Then Trump gave himself credit for saving millions of tax dollars during the first two weeks of his tenure: \"But we will ensure that none of the taxpayers' dollars is wasted. I have already saved over $700 million when I participated in negotiations on the F-35. You know about that.\" The savings with the F-35 joint fighter are real, but they were in business before Trump weeped wrong about the price tag. A spokesman for Trump did not respond to this verification of the facts. (The Washington fact-checker has already considered an allegation that Trump took credit for the $600 million reduction and gave him four Pinocchios.) The Transitional Tramp tweet about the F-35 program of the Ministry of Defence in the middle of the ever-largest aircraft purchases of various versions of the F-35 joint combat strike of the Air Force, Navy, and Navy. The F35 was built by Lockheed Martin. The plans call for more than 2,400 aircraft over 20 years at a cost of approximately $379 billion. Trump raised concerns about the F-35 program during the election campaign. \"I hear our current planes are better,\" said Hugh Hewitt's host radio show in October, 2015 wondering why the United States spends \"billions and billions of dollars.\" He raised his criticism of the cost after winning the election. \"The F-35 program is out of control,\" rewrite Trump Dick 12. \"Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases after 20 January.\" After Trump's tweet, Lockheed Martin's stock was reduced, and government officials defended the program. One week later, the F-35 Joint Programme Office issued the final contract price, which showed that air force and naval aircraft had been reduced by $5.9 million and $2.4 million respectively, while the Navy model had increased by $3.2 million. The Air Force team Chris Bogdan told the reporters that he expected that the costs would \"slow significantly\" and put the savings \"somewhere in the range of 6 to 7 percent per aircraft, per variable.\" The Washington Post calculated total savings between $549 million and $630 million for 90 aircraft. :: During his transition to office, Tramp held senior military officers, including the Executive Director, Luchead Martin, Marilyn Hughson, at his estate in Mar-A-Lago, Palm Beach, on 21 December to discuss how to reduce the costs of the F-35 programme. The Executive Director of Boing Dennis Muellenberg was also there. \"Boying is the contractor for the Air Force One, another project that Trump said was very expensive.\" The next day, Trump tweeted: \"Based on the high cost and extra costs of Lockheed Martin F-35, I asked Boeing to price the equivalent of F-18 Super Hornet!\" A week before Trump was installed, Hughson said that her company was about to reach a deal to cut costs significantly after the Mar-a-Lago meeting. On January 13, 2021, the distinguished fact-checkers announced in a story in which General David H. Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request to use marines for inaugural security, and told her that we were \"not working for you.\" On January 17, 2021, Defense Minister James Matisse ordered a review of the F-35 program in late January. On 3 February, the Ministry of Defence announced that it had reached an agreement with Lockheed Martin to reduce $728 million, resulting in \"less F-35s in the history of the program.\" Lockheed Martin issued a statement commending Tramp's participation: \"President Trump's personal participation in the F-35 programme has accelerated negotiations and sharpened our focus on price reduction. However, this is not the end of the story. The costs that were expected to decrease for years from defence and budget experts provide a great warning of Trump's claim: the costs have been declining for years. Steve Ellis, Deputy Chief Taxpayer for Public Awareness, said that the cost reduction for the F-35 Air Force replacement had been in business since before Trump announced his nomination in June 2015. \"The savings are slightly higher than originally anticipated, but all President Trump did was draw attention to the case,\" Elise said. \"He is not responsible for the savings, they were already in the pipeline long before he came to the crime scene.\" The cost of each aircraft was always a moving target, according to the Republic of Arizona in 2014, and the officials of Lockheed Martin said that the costs were decreasing. The initial production model completed in 2010 cost some $220 million, while projections for 2020 ranged from $75 million to $85 million. In 2015, the Director-General of the Lockheed F-35, Lauren Martin, said that the costs would be further reduced, \"to allow us to provide our fighters with a fifth-generation F-35 at a fourth-generation price by the end of the decade.\" The savings can be attributed to the normal learning curve, as tod Harrison, an expert in the military budget at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. He said, \"As you build more copies of material that naturally becomes more efficient at work.\" \"This is a big part of what we see here, and this was going to happen no matter who won the presidential election.\" However, Harrison said that Trump could take credit for the fact that the government was able to negotiate a deal with Lockheed so quickly for the next batch of planes. \"For many former F-35s, the Ministry of Defence negotiated with Lockheed for almost a year and a half and did not reach an agreement,\" he said. \"The Ministry of Defence eventually used a rather unusual method to complete the contract unilaterally in late 2016.\" Ben Friedman, an expert in the military budget at the Kato Liberal Institute, said that savings had nothing to do with Triumpe because they were already in the works. \"First, there are no savings yet, as expected, perhaps we hope,\" he said. \"Second, it is natural that costs will be reduced as production progresses and problems are solved. Third, it's not like anyone before Trump was looking to cut the F35 costs. It's been installed in the Pentagon for a long time.\" The Governor, Trump, said, \"I have already saved over $700 million when I participated in the negotiations on F-35.\" The Ministry of Defence announced a reduction of $728 million on 3 February for the aircraft. But Trump ignores that the government and Lockheed Martin have been working to cut costs for years long before the Trump tweet in December, which criticizes the price card. We're assessing this allegation mostly wrong. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2af530cd-51b2-4002-a026-d4433902373e", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03703"}
