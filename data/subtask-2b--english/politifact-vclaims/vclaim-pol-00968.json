Do Texans also oppose a wall?\nPolls show Texans divided on the wall\n\nCastro spokeswoman Jamie Geller said the congressman\u2019s claim was based on an April 2018 poll published by Quinnipiac University which reported that 53 percent of respondents surveyed opposed construction of a wall, with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.6 percentage points.\nWe decided to take a step back and consider polls released on this subject since 2016 from three non-partisan entities that run surveys in Texas to assess the validity of Castro\u2019s claim: University of Texas/Texas Tribune polls, Texas Lyceum polls and Quinnipiac University polls.\nFour polls showed more respondents opposing the wall than supporting it, with one poll showing the opposite. A sixth survey released Tuesday, after Castro made his claim on Texans opposing the wall, revealed an even split. Only two of the polls showed a clear majority in opposition to the wall.\n\nA University of Texas/Texas Tribune poll of registered voters in Texas published in June 2016 showed that 52 percent of respondents either strongly supported or somewhat supported a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\nThe same poll, which had a margin of error of plus or minus 2.83 percentage points, found 40 percent of respondents said they either strongly opposed or somewhat opposed a border wall. Of those polled, 8 percent said they did not know or had no opinion on the wall.\nTwo years later, in February 2018, a University of Texas/Texas Tribune poll showed that 50 percent of respondents said they either strongly opposed or somewhat opposed a border wall and 45 percent strongly supported or somewhat supported a wall.\nTwo polls from Texas Lyceum, a non-profit organization, showed majorities opposing the wall. These polls did not limit the pool of respondents to likely or registered voters and instead surveyed adults in Texas.\nA September 2016 poll from the group showed that 59 percent of adults polled opposed Trump\u2019s proposed border wall, with 35 percent supporting the wall. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.\nAn April 2017 Texas Lyceum poll, which had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points, reported 61 percent of respondents opposing the wall and 35 percent expressing support.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne year later, in April 2018, Quinnipiac University released a poll of Texas voters that showed 53 percent of respondents opposed building a wall along the border and 43 percent supported it. The poll surveyed 1,029 voters and the margin of error of 3.6 percentage points raised the possibility that fewer than 50 percent of Texas voters actually opposed the wall.\nGeller, Castro\u2019s spokeswoman, pointed to this April 2018 poll as the evidence behind the Democrat\u2019s claim.\nOn Tuesday, Quinnipiac University released a new poll that shows Texas voters are evenly split on whether they support a border wall.\nOf the 1,222 voters surveyed, 48 percent said they supported a wall and 48 percent said they opposed one. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points.\nPeter Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll, said the results show that Castro\u2019s claim is not entirely true, at least as of Tuesday afternoon.\n\"It\u2019s factually wrong,\" he said. \"It\u2019s 48-48.\"\nBut do Texas voters support the way Trump is pursuing construction of the wall?\nThe same Quinnipiac University Poll showed that 60 percent of respondents said they disapproved of Trump\u2019s move to use emergency powers to secure the funding needed to construct a wall.\nOur ruling\nCastro said \"most people in my home state of Texas disagree with the president building a wall across our border.\"\nPolls from the University of Texas/Texas Tribune, Texas Lyceum and Quinnipiac University showed that Texas voters and adults are largely divided on their support for a wall.\nOnly two of the polls showed a clear majority in opposition to the wall \u2013 those conducted by Texas Lyceum in 2016 and 2017. In these two polls, the survey questioned adults in Texas and was not limited to likely or registered voters, unlike the\u00a0University of Texas/Texas Tribune and Quinnipiac University polls.\nCastro\u2019s comment was not limited to registered or likely voters, so we kept that in mind while determining a ruling.\nWe rate this claim as Half True. Recent polls show more Texans opposing a border wall than supporting it, but only two of the six polls we considered showed a clear majority.\n\nHALF TRUE\u00a0\u2013\u00a0The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00968"}
