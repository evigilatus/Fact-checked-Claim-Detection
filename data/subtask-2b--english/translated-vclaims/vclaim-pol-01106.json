Kamala Harris has barely become a candidate for the Democratic Presidential candidacy before the charges of the generator begin on Twitter. Harris announced her candidacy on January 21st. The following morning, Jacob Wool - a supporter of Trump described by the media as \"a far-right conspiracy theory\" - questioned whether Harris was eligible to run. On Twitter, he wrote, \"Kamala Harris is not qualified to be president. Her father arrived from Jamaica in 1961 - a mother arrived from India in 1960. Neither parent was legally resident for five years before Harris was born, a condition of naturalization. Kemala was raised in Canada.\" Kamala Harris is not qualified to be president. Her father arrived from Jamaica in 1961 - her mother arrived from India in 1960, neither parent was legally resident for five years before Harris was born, and a naturalization requirement was raised in Canada - Jacob Wall (@Jakobawhl) 22 January 2019, after some pressure on the Internet, Wall doubled, and tweeting, \"There are serious questions about the eligibility of @KamalaHarris to serve as President of the United States. This isn't a party issue. Ted Cruz faced the same eligibility questions in 2016. I hope her campaign will address these questions sooner rather than later.\" Some raised questions about whether the late Sean John McCain, R-Aries, O-Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, could have served as President. McCain was born to two American parents in the Panama Canal area while his father was stationed there in the army. Cruz was born in Canada to two American parents. But most law scientists said that both McCain and Cruz would qualify for service if they won the presidency -- and Harris's case is clearer than theirs, because she was born in the United States. We tweeted in Wall, which was not received at the time of publication. However, when we investigated four legal scholars with experience in this question, they all agreed that \"serious questions\" from Wall were the red herring. Ian Sams, spokesman for the Harris Campaign, Politifact, said, \"Camala Harris was born in Oakland, California, which was, presumably, going to be in the United States of America. End of story.\" Sams refused to provide any additional information about Harris' father's naturalization, or about her time in Canada. But she's talked or written about these topics before, so we'll summarize the story here. I was born in 1964 to Donald Harris, an economist born in Jamaica, and Shimala J. Harris, a scientist. Donald Harris immigrated to the United States after accepting to study at the University of California-Berkeley, Harris wrote in her book 2019, \"The Truth We Hold: An American Journey.\" He received a Ph.D. from Berkeley in 1966, and is still an honorary professor. In his online curriculum vitae, Harris mentions his citizenship as \"Jamaica (by birth); and the United States of America (by sex). Harris recently wrote that \"in their early years\" Kemala and her younger sister Maya took on \"Recurring Visits to Jamaica.\" Meanwhile, Chiamala Gopalan was born in Chennai, South India, and graduated from Delhi University in 19. She applied to a post-graduate programme in Berkeley for a Ph.D. in nutrition and endocrine medicine, on her way to become a breast cancer researcher. On January 13, 2021, the distinguished fact-checkers announced in a story in which General David H. Berger, the commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for open security, and told her that we were \"not working for you.\" By Samantha Butterman, on January 17, 2021, Harris' parents met in Berkeley and were soon married. The couple broke up around the time the future senator was five and divorced a few years later, Harris wrote in her book. Harris continued to live in California until she was in middle school, when she offered her mother a job in Montreal to teach at McGill University. Harris wrote about how unhappy he was about the distance from her home, about the cold weather, and about having to sail into the city in a language you barely know. But \"When I got to high school, I had adapted to our new surroundings,\" I wrote. Harris, left Montreal to attend Howard University in Washington, D.C. She became a senator from California in 2017. This makes personal history interesting. However, contrary to Wool's tweeting, the determination of Harris' eligibility for the presidency is totally irrelevant. The Constitution of the United States states that \"no person shall be entitled unless he or she is a natural citizen born, or a citizen of the United States, at the time of the adoption of this Constitution, to hold the office of President.\" So the main language is whether Harris is a born natural citizen. Experts say it corresponds to this definition. First, there is the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. The relevant part states that \"all persons born or naturalized in the United States, subject to its jurisdiction, are citizens of the United States and the State in which they reside.\" Second, there is the 1952 Act (8 United States Act, section 1401) which reproduces the language in the Fourteenth Amendment and states that people born in the United States are \"national and citizens.\" Third, there is Supreme Court decision 1898, known as Wong Kim Ark. In their majority decision 6.2, the judges decided that Wong - and other persons born on the territory of the United States, with some clear exceptions - were already eligible for citizenship under the Fourteenth Amendment. \"If you were born in the United States, you were automatically a natural American citizen under the Constitution,\" said Harvard Law Professor Einer Alhauge. Sarah Dougin, Professor of Law at the Catholic University, agreed. \"Her birth in the United States, to a person who is not a member of the foreign diplomatic service or who is not under the jurisdiction of the United States, makes her a United States citizen unless she subsequently renounces her nationality. There is no reason to look where her parents came from, how long her parents were living in the United States before she was born, or where she grew up.\" Two other professors of law with experience in this area, Mary Brigid McManmon of the University of Widener and Melinda L. Seymour of the University of Texas A&M, have agreed that Harris is clearly qualified. \"Kamala Harris is not eligible to be president,\" according to \"serious questions\" concerning the status of her parents' naturalization and the time she spent growing up in Canada. Constitutional scholars agree that the reformulation of the details of Harris' upbringing is a smokescreen, because the only important factor is that Harris was born in the United States. The 14th Amendment, the Supreme Court Decision of 1898 and the 1952 Act make it clear that any person born in the United States is eligible to stand as President.
