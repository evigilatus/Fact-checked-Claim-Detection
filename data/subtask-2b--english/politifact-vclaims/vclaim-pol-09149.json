The Occupy movement is now less demonstrative, with more strategic protests against banks and other businesses for various practices.\n\n\nSo what does Hougesen have to prove she\u2019s right about Nunn? She pointed to an op-ed that Nunn wrote in The Washington Post a few days before Christmas 2011 titled \"Millennials to business: Social responsibility isn\u2019t optional.\" It contained a few references to the Occupy movement.\n\n\nHere\u2019s what we know about Nunn. She is the daughter of former U.S. Sen. Sam Nunn, a Democrat who is respected by many conservatives on national security issues. She is the chief executive officer of the Points of Light Foundation, a nonprofit, nonpartisan volunteer organization inspired by then-President George H.W. Bush. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported the foundation brought in $55 million in revenue in 2011 and mobilized 4 million volunteers worldwide for a range of causes last year. Neil Bush, son of the former president, is the board chairman.\n\n\nBeing in charge of a nonpartisan volunteer organization requires skill in working with people of all political positions. As an elected official once told us \"I have friends on both sides of the issue and I always support my friends.\" One recent Nunn blog post on the Points of Light website had a picture of Republican strategist Karl Rove and Democratic Party organizer Donna Brazile dancing together at a conference.\n\n\nSo what did Nunn write about it in her op-ed?\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKasim Reed\n\n\nstated on October 17, 2011 in statements to the public\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn letting Occupy Atlanta protesters stay in Woodruff Park.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Willoughby Mariano \u2022 October 24, 2011\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Occupy Wall Street movement is largely fueled by a relatively small set of young people who view the protests as a fight for their future,\" her op-ed began. \"The vast majority, however, are getting up and going to work every day \u2014 or wishing they could. These individuals are part of a less dramatic but, perhaps, equally powerful movement of Millennials shaping the future of business. As consumers, employees and entrepreneurs, Millennials are shifting the norms of corporate America\u2019s conduct, ethical imperatives and purpose.\"\n\n\nMost of the article was about millennials, people typically born between 1980 and 2000. Nunn\u2019s only other reference to the Occupy movement was at the end of her op-ed.\n\n\n\"The values behind Occupy Wall Street are manifesting themselves in the marketplace and companies that are failing to take notice should start,\" she wrote. \"These people-powered movements may not have stopped the markets in their tracks, but they are creating the demand for new forms of corporate behavior and ethical imperatives. The winning brands of the future will be ones that authentically respond.\"\n\n\nHougesen said she was convinced Nunn was praising Occupy Wall Street upon reading the op-ed.\n\n\n\"When Michelle Nunn wrote that the \u2018values behind Occupy Wall Street are manifesting themselves in the marketplace and companies\u2019 and that protestors are \u2018fighting for their future,\u2019 it led us \u2013 and many progressives - to believe that she supported the movement. If over the past seventeen months Ms. Nunn has changed her view or beliefs, we would welcome her clarification,\" Hougesen said.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNunn referenced Occupy Wall Street in a January 2012 blog post reflecting on a dinner party discussion at her Atlanta home involving Martin Luther King Day.\n\n\n\"We broke bread and talked about the bright spots and challenges in our community in terms of race, class and the unfulfilled dimensions of Dr. King's dream. We talked about how Dr. King's nonviolent and creative dissent continues to animate our world - from the Arab Spring to Occupy Wall Street,\" she wrote.\n\n\nNunn did not respond directly to our interview requests. Gordon Giffin, a former aide to her father who has been involved in discussions with the younger Nunn about her political future, contacted us via email. Giffin and a Points of Light spokeswoman said Nunn\u2019s op-ed was aimed at talking about millennials.\n\n\"Her writings do not endorse the actions of the \u2018occupy\u2019 movement but rather point out that there are numerous other examples of how the younger generation is seeking to make a difference that might be ignored by (the) press\u2019\u2019 focus on the \u2018occupy\u2019 crowd. Perhaps misrepresentation is the game of the day in DC but we have higher standards in Georgia,\" said Giffin, a former U.S. ambassador to Canada who now is a partner at the influential law firm McKenna Long & Aldridge.\n\nThis was a tough call for us. To sum up, the NRSC claimed that Nunn praised the Occupy movement. Its argument is based on an op-ed she wrote in 2011.\n\n\nThe op-ed referenced Occupy a couple of times, but Nunn supporters say the intent of the article was to talk about young people and their role in the marketplace. The bulk of the op-ed was about millennials.\n\n\nThe claim has an element of truth but ignores critical factors that give a different impression. We rate this claim Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09149"}
