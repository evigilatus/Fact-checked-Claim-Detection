Ninety-two percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term were for women. The 92 per cent claim dates back to the 2012 presidential race when it was used by the Republican National Committee and nominated by the National Democratic Party (NDP) Mette Romny. At that time, March 2012, the claim was somewhat digitally correct but was also selected and defective. We've often misevaluated it. We contacted and did not respond to the Fiorina campaign, so we are not sure whether it based its statement on the same data as the Romney campaign. But here's what we found in April 2012: between January 2009 and March 2012, the overall decline in employment, according to the Labour Statistics Office, was 740,000 people. In the same period, the number of working women decreased by 683,000. Do the oath and you'll get 92.3%. The major problem with the claim in 2012 was that it chose the starting date for the evaluation of Obama &apos; s job register. The recession began in December 2007 and did not take place until January 2009, when it was about to end. It is difficult to blame any president for the economic situation he inherited. On January 18, 2021 in the Committee &apos; s discussion. \"The United States is the only modern industrial country that does not already have a paid family medical leave program.\" By Warren Fiske on January 28, 2021. During that period, the number of women employed had shifted to other jobs and had become a net gain. Government data indicate an increase of 416,000 working women between January 2009 and January 2013. Total employment has also risen by 1.3 million people. Therefore, more women were working at the end of Obama &apos; s first term compared to the day he first took office. We used the time frame from January 2009 to January 2013 to be consistent with the original Republican framework for criticism of Obama's economic policies. The Governor, Fiorena, said that 92 per cent of the jobs lost during Obama's first term were for women. By January 2013, the job numbers do not support this at all. The number of women with jobs increased by 416,000 during Obama's first term. We value this allegation wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05797"}
