Teal'c said: \"The solution to Jin Hagan is to spend more money.\" \"It's very simple. The government must get out of the way. We must control our spending, and we must lower regulations. \"Sen. Hagan, when she cast her decisive vote for Obama's welfare, voted to kill the equivalent of 2.5 million jobs.\" The critics of the Health Care Act have long argued that the new regulations they have put in place, especially those relating to business, would hinder employment - or, in a language more explosive than the campaign, would be \"job killer.\" The critics received what appeared to be a push when the Congressional Budget Office - a non-partisan number writer in Congress - issued a report on the subject in February 2014. The Community Bureau expects that by 2017, there will be about 2 million fewer workers than it will be in the absence of the law. OIOS said that this number would increase to about 2.5 million by 2024. However, most critics of the law overlooked some critical facts when citing these figures. Why \"murder\" is the wrong word, the biggest problem with Teal'c describing the findings of the Central Bureau is that he used the word \"murder.\" This is inaccurate because it indicates that employers will separate 2.5 million people, or because businesses will not create so many jobs. This is not what the report said, but the decline will essentially be achieved by voluntary choices by workers, not by employers. The organization thought that when millions of people offered them new options to buy health insurance outside their work, they would decide that they did not need to work as much. The report estimated that the Obama Care Programme would \"restrict the total number of working hours on the Internet by about 1.5 per cent to 2.0 per cent from 2017 to 2024, almost because workers would choose to provide less employment - given the new taxes and other incentives they would face and the financial benefits some would receive. This would be equal to \"a decree in the number of full-time workers equal to about 2 million in 2017, rising to about 2.5 million in 2024.\" On January 16, 2021, Jordan Rachel stated in Tweedda that the minimum wage of $15 per hour would raise the price of taco bill burrito to $38. By Bill McCarthy: 20 January 2021, these changes, as stated by the Civil Affairs Bureau, will not lead to \"an increase in unemployment (i.e. an increase in the number of workers seeking employment but not looking for it) or underemployment (e.g. part-time workers who prefer to work longer hours per week).\" It is clear that the report predicts that total employment will continue to rise. It will not rise as if the health care law does not exist. It should be noted that the report contains less explicit observations on the impact of the Health Care Act on employment. As more people choose to work less, the Community Bureau concluded that the labour force participation rate should decrease, placing a greater burden on those still working to support the social safety net. Any change in labour force participation is at the top of the already significant shift towards retirement, driven by the ageing of the child &apos; s surge. In addition, some commentators expressed concern about the low number of workers due to the availability of tax-backed insurance. In the end, he sums up a trade-off, Tara Sinclair, economist from George Washington University, said Politi Fact earlier this year. \"It is recognized that there are some sensitive issues with the government that are likely to pay or support health-care costs for people who can work but do not choose,\" said Sinclair. \"But generally I think separating health care from work, at least makes it like any other service where employment may provide money to pay for it but where we do not make our choices, is a good thing.\" Thanks to him, Teal &apos; \u00eds - unlike many of his Republican colleagues - managed to avoid a single linguistic dilemma. The Teales formulated the findings of the Community Bureau as anticipating a reduction of 2.5 million jobs, rather than simply saying a reduction of 2.5 million jobs. This is an important distinction because the community office did not mention the number of jobs to be reduced; it referred to the equivalent of full-time jobs. This may sound deep in weeds, but it's remarkable. These equivalent jobs will consist of lots of pieces and pieces of hours in the week that people choose to drop. For example, some of these persons may work in two or three jobs, more than 40 hours a week, and will choose to reduce them to a more reasonable post or posts. Last note: We're not too wild about Teal'c's description of Hagen making the \"critical vote\" of Obamakari. In most cases when we considered that allegation, we had classified it mostly as false, as any of the supporters of the 60th Senate could have been described as having made a decisive vote. But for the sake of simplicity, we will only consider the question of recruitment in bringing this allegation to the truth O-Meter. In our debate, Thelis, by voting for Obamakari, Sen Kai Hagan, said \"a vote to kill the equivalent of 2.5 million jobs.\" The main problem with this allegation is that Telis used the word \"murder.\" This description is detrimental, as the reduction will result from the voluntary work of workers, not from the dismissal of employers. In fact, the Central Bureau said that the law would not push unemployment up. In general, we assess Teal'c's claim mostly false.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07184"}
