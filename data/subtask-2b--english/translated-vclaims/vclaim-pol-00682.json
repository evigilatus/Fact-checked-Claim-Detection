During the 27 April 2019 march in the Green Gulf, Trump confirmed that his supporters in Wisconsin knew how good the unemployment rate in the country was. \"The unemployment rate of Wisconsin workers has reached historically low levels,\" said Trump for the crowd. \"It's never been this low before, ever, ever, ever.\" In March 2019, the United States Bureau of Labour Statistics reported that the unemployment rate in Wisconsin was 2.9 per cent. But was there a time in history when it was less? We decided to do some research. The historical reserve data from BLS show that Wisconsin has been in a downward spiral of unemployment since the peak of the financial crisis in 2009. Since then, the highest rate of unemployment recorded in Wisconsin has reached 9.3 per cent, with the lowest rate now at 2.9 per cent. However, was there a time when he was below this figure? On January 16, 2021, Jordan Rachel stated in Tweedda that the minimum wage of $15 per hour would raise the price of taco bill burrito to $38. By Bill McCarthy: 20 January 2021 BLS spokesman Gary Steinberg says it was close, but 2.9 per cent is the lowest unemployment rate in Wisconsin on the record. \"The unemployment rate in Wisconsin is similar data for 1976,\" said Steinberg. The unemployment rate of 2.9 per cent in January and February 2019 is the lowest in the records. At the national level, 2.9 per cent of Wisconsin in March 2019 left association with Idaho and Virginia. That means Wisconsin is ranked eighth in the country. North Dakota and Vermont were initially linked to an unemployment rate of 2.3 per cent. Meanwhile, Alaska was at the bottom with an unemployment rate of 6.5 per cent. According to the Ministry of Labour Development of the State of Wisconsin, the State added a total of 11,400 non-agricultural and 19,300 private sector jobs between February 2018 and February 2019. At the same time, the labour force participation rate in Wisconsin -- the measuring stick that looks at the other side of the equation -- was 67.5% in February. This was better than the national average by more than four points. Our classification of Trump says Wisconsin had the lowest unemployment rate ever on a recent march in Green Bay. The available data support his claim that Wisconsin did not have an unemployment rate of less than 2.9 per cent. We're assessing Trump's claim correctly.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00682"}
