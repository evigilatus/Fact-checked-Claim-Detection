Scott Walker tweeted this from his official Twitter account:\n\"From 2010-2014, median household income has actually gone up 7.4 percent.\"\nThe word actually seemed to allude to a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel news article from the front page of that morning\u2019s newspaper. The headline was: \"Household income takes sharp downturn in most of Wisconsin.\"\nSo, which is it?\nHave incomes in the Badger State gone up?\nOr down?\nPrevious claim\nIn July 2015, while pursuing his presidential bid, Walker used his personal Twitter account to say that under his leadership, Wisconsin median household income was up 2.7 percent, while it was down 1.3 percent nationally under President Barack Obama.\nOur rating was Mostly False.\nWalker had cited U.S. Census data, usually a gold-standard source. But the data was from the census\u2019 Current Population Survey. That set is good for the national income picture, but less accurate at the state level.\nThe better data is from the Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey, a rolling collection of household and demographic statistics from 3.5 million addresses.\nThose figures revealed a much different picture than Walker had painted: An income drop nationally, yes -- of 1.72 percent.\nBut also an income drop -- not an increase, as Walker stated -- in Wisconsin of 1.62 percent.\nSo, what about the governor\u2019s claim this time?\nThe news story\nThe Journal Sentinel\u2019s article reported on newly released data from the American Community Survey covering two periods: 2005 to 2009 and 2010 to 2014.\nMedian household income fell by a significant margin in two-thirds of Wisconsin counties during the period.\nImportantly, the article reported figures that are adjusted for inflation.\nBy the way, think of median household income as the midpoint: Half of Wisconsin households have an income higher than the median, and half have an income that is lower.\nWalker spokeswoman Laurel Patrick emailed the Journal Sentinel about the article, saying it was distorted because it did not include the 7.4 percent figure Walker cited in his tweet. The Journal Sentinel asked her for the data that produced that figure.\nWhat the newspaper found was that Walker used American Community Survey data -- but didn\u2019t properly adjust for inflation. That means he compared 2010 dollars to 2014 dollars, an economic no-no.\nWhenever you are looking at income, \"you should be looking at real income instead of nominal income, which means you adjust for changes,\" said Abdur Chowdhury, a professor of economics at Marquette University in Milwaukee and former chief economist of the United Nations Economic Commission in Europe.\nOtherwise, he said, you\u2019re looking at apples and oranges.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"$100 today is not the same as $100 last year,\" Chowdhury said. \"If you adjust for price, what you get is the real change in your buying power.\"\nFor the news article and for this analysis, the Journal Sentinel used the Consumer Price Index from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics to adjust for inflation.\nHere\u2019s what the adjusted data show:\nWalker\u2019s method:\n\n\n\n\n2010 Wisconsin median household income -- unadjusted\n\n\n2014 median household income adjusted for inflation (2014 dollars)\n\n\nDifference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$49,001\n\n\n$52,622\n\n\n7.4% increase\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nAfter adjusting for inflation:\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2010 Wisconsin median household income -- adjusted for inflation\n\n\n2014 median household income adjusted for inflation (2014 dollars)\n\n\nDifference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$53,198\n\n\n$52,622\n\n\n1.1% decrease\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\"What you are doing is the right approach, looking at real income instead of nominal income,\" Chowdhury said. \"The real reason they (Walker) use nominal income is because it looks better.\"\nOur rating\nWalker said that from 2010-2014, median household income in Wisconsin \"has actually gone up 7.4 percent.\"\nIn the best light, median household income in Wisconsin rose by 7.4 percent from 2010 to 2014.\nBut the better figures account for inflation. And by that measure, income dropped by 1.1 percent during that period.\nFor a statement that contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate Walker\u2019s claim Mostly False.\n\nMore on Scott Walker\nIn Context: What Scott Walker said about a Canada wall\nScott Walker: Wisconsin\u2019s Government Accountability Board \"ignored their duties and did not regularly audit\" voters to remove felons \"for a span of 16 elections.
