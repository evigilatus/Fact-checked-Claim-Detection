Republicans and Democrats are fighting about which party to blame for the peak epic spending. The argument is part of a debate about the amount - or whether - of raising the federal debt ceiling. The United States has exceeded the borrowing ceiling, and the Treasury Department states that the country may default on its loans if it does not raise the limit on 2 August. The National Republican Congress Commission blames the disorder on the Republic of Jerry Connolly, representing the North Virginia region, and his democratic colleagues. He is one of the 60 Democrats in the House of Representatives who have been subjected to similar attacks by the National Refugee Council, which elects Republicans to the Chamber. \"Grey Connolly and his Democrat colleagues went into fast spending and now their credit card has reached the limit,\" said NRCC in an e-mail of May 18 and a press release. Was Connolly really -- or even all the Democrats at home -- who exceeded the limit of the American credit card? Let's take a look. Connolly took office on 3 January 2009 and was re-elected in 2010. On the day he entered Congress, the federal debt totalled $10.63 trillion, according to the Treasury Department. As at 31 May, debt stood at $14.34 trillion. This is an increase of $3.72 trillion, or 35 per cent, since Connolly became a member of Congress. Therefore, it seems immediately that Connolly himself would not have exceeded the maximum credit card. He wasn't there long enough to do that. How did the nation pile up so much debt? You may recall the tax cuts defended by Congressional Republicans and former President George W. Bush during the happiest budget periods -- the tax cuts that were extended in December for two years under Democratic President Barack Obama. While some economists say that this was necessary to give the economy a kick, it also means that money comes less than tax revenues. Before the last extension, the Congressional Research Service said that Bush's $10 trillion tax cuts had played a major role in the country's annual deficit. Some will argue that tax cuts can in fact be paid for by stimulating economic growth, but Poletti Fuckett has previously found that the budget office of Congress, the Treasury, the Joint Tax Commission and the White House Council of Economic Advisers say that tax cuts lead to lower revenues than they would otherwise have been - even if they stimulate some economic growth. Last year, the Budget Office of Congress stated that, as many in the General Budget Office would like to see it extended permanently, it would cost $3.3 trillion over 10 years and increase the deficit. Then there was the recent economic downturn, which also played a role. The nation is still engaged in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, with billions of dollars flowing to pay for them. These began during the years of Bush and continued under Obama's rule. The Liberal Centre for Budget and Policy Priorities says that only two policies dating back to the Bush administration - tax cuts and wars in Iraq and Afghanistan - accounted for more than $500 billion of the deficit in 2009 \"and will account for $7 trillion of the deficit in 2009 until 2019, including associated debt servicing costs.\" What do conservative economists say? Our colleagues at Polyte Fact Ohio Brian Riedel, a major budget analyst at the Conservative Heritage Foundation, asked about his opinion on the CBPP analysis. It was rude. \"In essence, their analysis fails basic statistics,\" he said in e-mail. Riddle referred us to his blog, where he wrote, \"imagining a basketball team losing 100-98.\" It would not make sense for their opponent to choose one basket of cherry and blame it for 100% of the loss - leaving all the other baskets to be registered outside the hook. However, this is basically what CBPP does.\" The broader point of Riddle is that \"one can choose cherry\" any number of spending or tax policies and blame them for the whole problem. The Bank chose to choose tax cuts, wars, stimulus/failures, and economic decline to offset total deficits. It was easy for one to distinguish between social security and medical aid (combined cost: $13 trillion), medical care and net interest costs ($13 trillion), or estimated expenditure ($15 trillion) for blame. There is no mathematical reason to account for the programs selected by CBP while ignoring other costs.\" Where does that leave us? Each side is the choice of cherry numbers. The liberal think tank blames wars, tax cuts, stagnation and associated costs. According to the conservative think tank, the base of blame is larger and involves entitlements as well as discretionary spending. The spokesperson for DNCC Halley Morris Pend Politi Vac 2009 noted that when Bush took office in 2001, the national debt was $5.73 trillion. When he left eight years later, it was $10.7 trillion. She said, \"It's very hard for Gob to argue about the maximum credit card.\" Let's go over it. Yes, the nation's debt rose rapidly during the two and a half years that Jerry Connolly was in office. Liberal economists blamed the large deficit on the wars and tax cuts that began under Bush, the Republican, but Obama, the Democratic, continued. Connolly supported the Incentives Bill in 2009 and the extension of the tax reduction in December 2010 and other measures that increased the federal deficit. But two thirds of the federal deficit was already there when Connolly took office. Why should he be responsible for that? Go one step further, why would Democrats take the full blow? The Republicans deserve to be blamed here too. The current financial situation of the nation is a rare achievement by both parties. At the same time, 35 per cent of the nation &apos; s debt came within two and a half years of Connolly &apos; s life in Congress.
