Asked why she\u2019s running for district attorney, Duty\u2019s reply says, in part, that Bradley \"reduced or dismissed \u00a036 percent of his felony cases to misdemeanors and passed them off to my office.\"\n\nFor the Statesman article, Duty responded to a reporter\u2019s question about whether she had ever prosecuted a felony by saying she has prosecuted felonies. Her reply continued: \"John Bradley is reducing 36 percent of all felonies to misdemeanors and passing them off to my office. That\u2019s double the statewide average.\"\n\nDuty told us by email that she had not aired the percentage to complain about her workload. \"The two points that I am making are these: One, 36 percent \u00a0is too high,\" she said, saying that statewide in 2011, the average rate for dismissing some felony cases and referring some as misdemeanors was 16 percent. \"This is not being \u2018tough on crime,\u2019\" she said by email.\n\nBradley later told us law enforcement officers initially indicate their judgment on whether a case should be a felony or misdemeanor. Then the DA\u2019s office evaluates each case, he said.\n\nDuty said she based the cited percentages on information collected and posted online by the Texas Office of Court Administration, which provides technical support and administrative assistance to the state\u2019s courts and judges.\n\nFrom the office\u2019s website, it\u2019s possible to download a report on \"felony case activity\" covering any recent time period for a county or the state. And according to the office\u2019s information, of 2,013 total felony cases resolved in Williamson County in 2011, 738 -- 37 percent -- were \"dismissals.\" Statewide, 16 percent of felony cases disposed were dismissals, according to the office\u2019s information.\n\nAccording to instructions for the district clerks who monthly update the figures, each case represents a charge against a defendant so several cases could involve a single person. However, if a defendant faces a multicount indictment, the instructions say, that\u2019s to be recorded as one case based either on the most serious charge or the first charge leveled against them.\n\nThose instructions also say the district clerks should report as dismissals those felony cases dropped for reasons including insufficient evidence; the defendant going unapprehended, being granted immunity for testimony or getting convicted in another case; a failure to hold a speedy trial; a decision to drop the case only to re-file a charge; or other unspecified reasons.\n\nAnother part of the instructions says \"transfers to county-level courts in your county when the case is reduced to a misdemeanor\" should be recorded in the \"all other dispositions\" category. In 2011, though, only 21 Williamson County cases fell into the \"all other dispositions\" category.\n\nWhat the heck?\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in remarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLisa David, the Williamson County district clerk, cleared up our confusion, saying in a telephone interview that felonies reduced to misdemeanors are mostly marked in the state database\u2019s \"dismissals\" category. She said that\u2019s because felony cases that become misdemeanors are mostly dismissed as a defendant agrees to plead guilty to a misdemeanor -- developments that fit the \"dismissals\" category.\n\nIn telephone interviews and by email, Bradley challenged the significance of Duty's cited \"dismissals\" percentage because not every felony charge is counted in the database under the method prescribed by the state. \"This is an ongoing issue with clerks and statistics,\" Bradley said. \"If this is true, then the total number of felony offenses being filed is being seriously undercounted.\"\n\nIn a telephone interview, Angela Garcia, an Office of Court Administration official, agreed that the database records the disposition of only one case for each defendant facing a multicount indictment -- the first one or the most serious one. \"You could have 10 charges in a case, but it would only be counted as one case,\" Garcia said.\n\nGarcia, the agency\u2019s judicial information manager, said, too, that the information in the database is not a precise indicator of the number of felony cases a district attorney hands off since the \"dismissals\" category is broad. All figures in the database are intended to help state lawmakers and other policymakers make decisions about creating, cutting or expanding programs, she said.\n\nGiven uncertainties about the applicability of the database to Duty\u2019s claim, we asked David, Duty and Bradley for precise counts for 2011 cases initially classified as felonies later converted to misdemeanors.\n\nDavid told us by email that her office could not break out how many felony cases were converted to misdemeanor cases.\n\nBradley initially said he did not have a count. He later said by email that his office\u2019s staff did track the number of 2011 felony cases referred to the county attorney as misdemeanors: 352. That would be a shade under 18 percent of the county\u2019s felony cases resolved that year, according to the state database.\n\nBradley further said that in more than 90 percent of the referred cases, his office had already worked out plea agreements, meaning the county attorney simply had to file the cases and present the guilty pleas for judicial approval.\n\nFor her part, Duty provided a chart indicating that by her office\u2019s tally, nearly 390 felony cases were reduced to misdemeanors in 2011. If so, that would have been a little over 19 percent of all the cases shown as disposed on the state database.\n\nDuty, who through May 6, 2012, had not sought a correction of her original comment to the newspaper, summed up by email: \"Bradley reduces 20 percent of his felonies and he dismisses 16 percent of his felonies. This is a total of 36 percent of his cases being dismissed/reduced. I have repeatedly made this statement publicly for months and I stand by it.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nAs Duty acknowledged to us, her published comment mistakenly indicated that 36 percent of felony cases in 2011 were reduced to misdemeanors handed off to her office; the relevant \"dismissals\" category on the state database folds in both cases dismissed and cases referred as misdemeanors.\n\nThe state database relied upon by Duty does not include a single category breaking out cases referred as misdemeanors, though the counts provided by Bradley and Duty indicate that the share of felonies referred to the county attorney\u2019s office as misdemeanors in 2011 was less than 20 percent.\n\nWe\u2019ll accept that Duty accurately described the 36 percent figure in other venues. However, her quoted claim to the Statesman rates Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11145"}
