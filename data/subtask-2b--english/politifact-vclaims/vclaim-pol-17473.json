The program had some unintended consequences \u2014 at times, weapons intended for Syrian rebels were stolen and sold on the black market, for example \u2014 but it was never designed to \"train ISIS Jihadists,\" as the post claims.\n\"Obama ordered CIA to train ISIS Jihadists,\" reads the over-the-top headline.\nThe blog post bases its claims primarily on a once-classified Defense Intelligence Agency document obtained by Judicial Watch, a conservative legal group.\nOn top of falsely alleging that Obama ordered the CIA to intentionally train members of ISIS, the post claims the released document confirms the United States and its partners \"actually facilitated the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) as an effective adversary against the government of the Syrian dictator President Bashar al-Assad.\"\nThe post also says that the DIA document \"declared that President Barack Obama and his counterparts within the coalition considered the establishment of a Salafist organization in eastern Syria in order to further downfall of the Assad regime.\"\nThe reality is not that simple.\nThe training program\nDespite what the post\u2019s headline says, Obama never ordered the CIA to train members of ISIS. In fact, the New York Times reported that Obama only \"reluctantly agreed\" to the training program to train and arm some Syrian rebels opposing Assad\u2019s government forces.\nThe program, code named Timber Sycamore, was a joint effort primarily between the CIA and other Arab intelligence agencies.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 21, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cDemocrats forced our GREAT troops to sleep on the ground of a PARKING garage after dragging them to DC for photo ops!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 22, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe program and its details are still largely classified. Most of what we know comes from media reports. The New York Times, for example, reported that the program trained thousands of fighters and was going well until Russian military aid forced the rebels to retreat. But there were other problems. In October 2015, the BBC reported that American officials admitted only four or five of the program\u2019s trainees \"had actually returned to the battle.\"\nFurther, an Al Jazeera and New York Times investigation revealed that millions of dollars in weapons the CIA meant to provide Syrian rebels had actually been systematically stolen and sold on the black market. From there, the weapons could fall into the wrong hands. Once, stolen CIA-supplied weapons were used in a shooting in Amman, Jordan, that killed five people, including two Americans.\nThe declassified document\nThe document obtained by Judicial Watch said Salafi-jihadists \u2014 fundamentalists who believe in the return to traditional Islam practices \u2014 the Muslim Brotherhood and al-Qaida in Iraq were \"the major forces driving the insurgency in Syria.\"\nWhile the document does not say anything about Obama, it seemed to explore some of the CIA training program\u2019s potential effects on Iraq.\u00a0\n\"If the situation unravels there is the possibility of establishing a declared or undeclared Salafist principality in Eastern Syria,\" reads the document. \"And this is exactly what the supporting powers to the opposition want, in order to isolate the Syrian Regime, which is considered the strategic depth of the Shia expansion (Iraq and Iran).\"\nEssentially, the document seems to say that the groups it identified as the \"major forces\" in the region supporting Syrian rebels hoped to establish a Salafist state in Eastern Syria. The document did not say the United States considered supporting this outcome, however.\nOur ruling\nThe headline said, \"Obama ordered CIA to train ISIS Jihadists.\"\nObama authorized a program in 2013 that trained and armed Syrian opposition forces. The program had its flaws, including that CIA-provided weapons were systematically stolen and sold on the black market, ending up in enemy hands. However, the declassified DIA document contained nothing that suggested the United States or its allies intentionally \"facilitated\" the rise of ISIS in their efforts to oppose Assad.\nFurther, there was no evidence the program ever trained known members of ISIS. That was never ordered by Obama.\nWe rate this claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17473"}
