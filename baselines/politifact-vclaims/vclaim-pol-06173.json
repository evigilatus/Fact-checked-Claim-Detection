Scott Walker may have vetoed 104 items from the 2015-\u201917 budget, but he left in one that has Democrats and union leaders upset.\nThe Wisconsin State AFL-CIO posted a meme to its Facebook page July 8, 2015 that in bold letters proclaims: \"Scott Walker\u2019s bad budget includes: No weekend for workers.\"\nThe meme goes on to say the change could \"lead to intimidation in the workplace and to an environment where bosses can pressure workers into working every single day of every single month without needed rest.\"\nIt\u2019s not the first time unions have slammed the governor.The most notable outcry came after Walker and Republicans passed Act 10, which sharply curtailed collective bargaining for most public employees. More recently, Walker signed a \"right-to-work\" measure in March 2015 that prohibits requiring private sector workers to pay union fees.\nThe no-weekend claim had come up before.\nAn opinion piece published in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel written by Stephanie Bloomingdale, secretary-treasurer of the Wisconsin State AFL-CIO declared, \"they took away the weekend.\" And a Gawker article, shared widely on social media sites, was titled, \"Wisconsin is trying to take away your right to a weekend.\"\nSo, now that it\u2019s summer, it begs this important question: Will you have to work this Saturday and Sunday?\nBackground on the law\nSince the 1970s, a law has required employers operating factories or retail stores to give workers at least 24 hours off every seven days.\nThat law does not apply to janitors, security personnel or those who care for live animals. People who are employed in the manufacture of butter, cheese or other dairy products, or in bakeries, flour and feed mills, hotels and restaurants are also exempt.\nPassage of the law came on the coattails of federal legislation -- the Occupational Safety and Health Act -- aimed at assuring safe and healthy working conditions. Wisconsin, and most other states, passed additional legislation in 1971 to improve employment standards.\nIn 2014, Republican lawmakers pushed a bill that would have allowed workers to voluntarily forgo that day of rest. The bill, which the state AFL-CIO lobbied against, passed committee, but did not get a vote in the full Senate.\nAt that time, supporters said the bill would give workers a way to earn some extra money, while allowing companies to increase production. For instance, if a company needed to run extra hours to fulfill an order, all workers would be eligible to get a piece of the extra cash.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSponsors said the idea came from the Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce. The Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce and the Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce also lobbied in support of the bill.\nBackers of the change noted the federal government does not impose limits on consecutive work days.\nHow it changes\nThe provision inserted into the state budget permits employees in certain industries \u00a0to voluntarily work seven days in a row. It was added in committee July 7, 2015, a day before the GOP-controlled Senate passed the budget.\nSo who can volunteer to work seven days without rest?\nThe same workers protected under the old law. So really just a fraction of workers in the state are affected by the budget provision -- though the union offers it as so sweeping that everyone might be affected.\u00a0\n\"There will be a chilling effect for everyone,\" Bloomingdale said in an interview. \"It sends the message that it\u2019s acceptable to go without a day of rest.\"\nJohn Witte, professor emeritus of political science and public affairs at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said the union\u2019s statement is \"clearly overstating the case.\"\nWitte said one problem for the workers is that employers could take advantage of the provision and subtly coerce workers to \"volunteer.\"\n\"If, however, employers tried to make that an overt requirement of employment, the workers could use that as a legal argument against the employer because that would clearly violate the voluntary nature of the action,\" Witte said.\nOur rating\nThe state AFL-CIO said, \"Scott Walker\u2019s bad budget includes: No weekend for workers.\"\nBut the provision does not apply to all workers, as the claim suggests. What\u2019s more, it is a voluntary thing -- workers could agree to the extra day to, for instance, earn extra overtime.\nWe rate the claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06173"}
