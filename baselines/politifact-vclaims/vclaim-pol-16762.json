Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., quickly weighed in on Twitter.\n\"Murray Energy, the largest coal company in the United States, filed for bankruptcy,\" Manchin tweeted on Oct. 29, 2019. \"If Murray rejects the UMWA pension plan obligations in Chapter 11 bankruptcy, the UMWA pension fund will be insolvent by 2020. Before last night it was projected to be insolvent by 2022.\"\nMurray Energy, the largest coal company in the United States, filed for bankruptcy. If Murray rejects the UMWA pension plan obligations in Chapter 11 bankruptcy, the UMWA pension fund will be insolvent by 2020. Before last night it was projected to be insolvent by 2022.\u2014 Senator Joe Manchin (@Sen_JoeManchin) October 29, 2019 \n\u00a0\nHowever, we noticed a problem with how Manchin described Murray Energy. Is it really the largest coal company in the United States?\nManchin\u2019s office pointed us to a New York Times article published about the bankruptcy the same day as his tweet.\nThe article includes this sentence: \"Murray, the nation\u2019s largest privately held coal company, has nearly 7,000 employees and operates 17 mines in six states across Appalachia and the South as well as two mines in Colombia.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden canceled the Keystone pipeline because Warren Buffett \u201cdonated $58 million\u201d to his campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManchin\u2019s office also cited a CNN article from the same day that used similar language. \"The slow death of the American coal industry has forced Murray Energy, the largest private coal miner in the United States, to file for bankruptcy protection Tuesday,\" CNN\u2019s article said.\nManchin\u2019s tweet glossed over a phrase repeated in both articles -- \"privately held.\"\nSo where does Murray rank among all coal companies?\nMurray Energy pointed us to data from the Energy Information Administration, a division of the federal Department of Energy. Here\u2019s a table drawn from the agency\u2019s statistics.\n\n\u00a0\nThis shows that Murray Energy ranks fourth, behind Peabody Energy Corp., Arch Coal Inc., and Cloud Peak Energy. We confirmed that each of the three companies ahead of Murray are publicly held, making Murray the largest private coal company but not the largest coal company overall.\nOur ruling\nManchin tweeted that Murray Energy is \"the largest coal company in the United States.\"\nHe flubbed the description -- Murray Energy is the largest privately held coal company, but not the largest coal company overall. If you include both private and public coal companies. Murray ranks fourth in the country. That makes it one of the largest, but not the largest.\nWe rate the statement Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16762"}
