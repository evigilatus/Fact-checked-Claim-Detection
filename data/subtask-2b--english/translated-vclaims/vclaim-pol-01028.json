We wondered if Scott was right, so we looked at the data. In 1960, the federal minimum wage was $1 per hour. This is equivalent to $8.57 per hour in dollars today. (We used inflation calculators at the Labour Statistics Bureau of Accounts.) In 1961, the minimum wage was raised to $1.15 and sat there the following year. In dollar terms today, it amounted to $9.63 in 1961 and $9.57 in 1962. In 1963, wages increased by $1.25 and remained there for the next three years. In today &apos; s dollars, it amounted to $10.23 in 1963, $10.13 in 1964, $9.94 in 1965 and $9.69 in 1966. In 1967, wages rose to $1.40. In dollars today, it was $10.56. In 1968, wages rose to $1.60 and remained there for six years. In today &apos; s dollars, it amounted to $11.58 -- a high percentage at all and $10.98 in 1969. When the minimum wage was adjusted on the basis of inflation, the average federal minimum wage during the 1960s was $10.09.00 and $2.84.00 higher than today &apos; s wage. This is a 28 per cent depreciation. Over a working week of 40 hours, this translates into $113.60 of the total lost wage. Check the facts (Kirk Cox) was mentioned on January 13, 2021 in a speech. Virginia ranked lowest third of the states in the management of the COVID-19 vaccine. \u2022 On 20 January 2021, the Scott Bill gradually raised the minimum wage to $15 per hour in 2024, and then evaluated it for inflation. Scott and other supporters of this measure say that he will put more money in the pockets of an estimated 40 million workers, many of whom are women and minorities. They predict that an increase in spending power will increase the economy. According to opponents of the bill, including the United States Chamber of Commerce, the 15-hour fee would be detrimental to small businesses, especially those in low-cost areas. It should be noted that at least three bills were submitted to the General Assembly this winter to raise the minimum wage in Virginia, the federal minimum of $7.25 per hour. All measures in the committees have been killed. Thirty states raised their minimum wage above the federal minimum. Our governor Scott said, \"The worker who gets the minimum wage today and earns $7.25 an hour has less purchasing power than the minimum wage in the 1960s.\" When the minimum wage in that contract was adjusted, by inflation to dollars today, it was $8.57 per hour to $11.58. The average over the decade was $10.09 and an hour much higher than the current rate. We appreciate that Scott's statement is correct. Corrigendum: Bobby Scott, Democrat. An earlier version of this fact-finding check misdefined his party.
