Those are the folks who, in accordance with -- or perhaps in spite of -- the primaries and caucuses, will choose the party nominees.\nAhead of the Democratic gathering in Philadelphia, Bernie Sanders is causing fireworks by trying to pry away superdelegates who have pledged to support Hillary Clinton.\nAnd Republican delegate leader Donald Trump has threatened to run as an independent if he is not treated fairly in Cleveland.\nAll of which is to say there is significance attached to a delegate\u2019s support -- particularly when the delegate, or in this case a superdelegate, is the head of a state party.\nOn April 6, 2016, the day after Wisconsin's presidential primary, Wisconsin Associated Press reporter Scott Bauer tweeted that in 2015, state Democratic Party chairwoman Martha Laning told him she would give her superdelegate vote to the winner of the primary -- but that now she was telling him her vote would go instead to the presumptive nominee.\nSo, has Laning flip flopped?\nThat\u2019s what our Flip-O-Meter is for -- to determine whether a political leader has been consistent on an issue.\nWhat she said\nIn November 2015, in response to a question from the Associated Press, the Democratic Party sent a statement from Laning saying:\n\"I will be supporting the candidate who wins the primary in Wisconsin next year. The Democratic voters in Wisconsin will evaluate each candidate and pick the strongest one and I will cast my vote for the candidate that they pick.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin LeMahieu\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a TV interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It takes quite a while on Election Day to load those ballots, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we noted, Sanders\u2019 Wisconsin win was decisive -- he captured more than 56 percent of the vote, to Clinton\u2019s 43 percent.\nAt least one other Democratic superdelegate from Wisconsin has attributed the margin to the fact that Wisconsin holds an open primary, which allowed anyone -- voters who identify as Democrats or not -- to cast a ballot for the Vermont senator or the former secretary of state.\nWhether that influenced Laning isn't clear.\nBut she did reverse her position, with her spokesman telling the AP after the primary she would back the presumptive nominee. She had also made such statements a few weeks earlier.\nAt this stage, the presumptive nominee is\u00a0Clinton, not Sanders.\n(As of April 10, 2016, Clinton is within 627 of the 2,383 delegates needed for the nomination. Sanders is 1,315 short, leaving him little chance of winning the nomination with the remaining primaries and caucuses. The tally, from the Associated Press, includes superdelegates.)\nWhen we asked the state party about Laning\u2019s apparent change, we received this statement from Laning:\n\"As the party chair, I feel one of my main goals is to bring our party together to work together to defeat the Republicans. \u00a0As our primary race has evolved and I have had the opportunity to talk to many voters across the state, I concluded it would be better for me to remain neutral and thereby be supportive of all our members\u2019 individual choice. Once we have a nominee I will work with Democrats across the state to create unity and ensure that candidate becomes our next president.\"\nOur rating\nIn November 2015, Laning said she would cast her superdelegate vote at the Democratic National Convention for the presidential candidate who wins the Wisconsin primary.\nBut after the primary, which was won by Sanders, she reversed that position. She now says she will back whoever is the party\u2019s presumptive nominee -- which at this stage is Clinton.\nWe rate that a Full Flop.\nEditor's note: On April 12, 2016, after we published this item, the Wisconsin Democratic Party provided us examples of where Laning, before Wisconsin's primary election, said she had changed her position. For example, in one interview posted March 13, 2016, Laning said:\u00a0\"I will be putting my support behind the nominee.\" We have edited this item to reflect that timing.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05121"}
