The person at the center of the story isn't even a CNN journalist.\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nHere\u2019s what happened\nClaas Relotius, an award-winning reporter and editor for Der Spiegel, the biggest weekly news magazine in Germany, resigned Dec. 17 after the organization found he falsified articles on a \"grand scale and even invented characters, deceiving both readers and his colleagues,\" the newspaper announced.\nDer Spiegel said Relotius confessed he had made up material in at least 14 articles since 2011.\nIn 2014, CNN named Relotius the Journalist of the Year and Print Journalist of the Year. The awards were for German-language journalism and decided by an independent jury. The last awards were given in 2015, CNN reported.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a statement to the Associated Press, CNN International said the independent panel of judges who awarded Relotius the awards decided unanimously to remove them following revelations about his fraud.\nThe story about the incident on the website The Federalist Papers\u00a0isn't inaccurate. But it includes a purposively deceptive image of a top CNN correspondent to bait readers on Facebook into clicking on the story itself. Readers seeing the post caught the deception, but only after clicking on the item.\n\"Carolyn McKnight Langdon\u00a0Wow, the hypocrisy.... Isn't putting the face of Acosta on this article link (about a German reporter) equal to the kinds of Truth spinning shenanigans CNN is often accused of?\"\n\n\"Ellie Merritt\u00a0How much more misleading can you get? Had I not seen the Federalist banner, I would have sworn this was another misleading CNN article. Shame on you.\"\n\"Chris Domenico\u00a0Dang it....ya got me. I kept telling myself \"don\u2019t click, it\u2019s not what you think\", yet I clicked. Hat\u2019s off to you....\"\nOur ruling\nA story from The Federalist Papers with the headline \"CNN Journalist Of The Year Fired For Creating Fake News Stories,\" is being shared on social media with a photo of CNN reporter Jim Acosta.\nThe post is misleading clickbait. Acosta has nothing to do with the story, and the journalist fired doesn't work for CNN. Readers caught on to the gimmick if they read the full story.\nOverall, we rate this claim Half True.\n Share the Facts 2018-12-20 21:35:25 UTC   PolitiFact    4 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Half True  Says \"CNN Journalist Of The Year Fired For Creating Fake News Stories,\" with image of CNN reporter Jim Acosta.
