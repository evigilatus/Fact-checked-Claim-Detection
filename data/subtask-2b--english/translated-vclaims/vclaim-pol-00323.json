On his website on August 21, Thompson gave his opinion on the debate with a commentary on New York City and its efforts to prosecute arms manufacturers. \"In non-theoretically, all of this comes at a time in the past where violent crime rates and weapons ownership rates have historically been high at the national level,\" Thomson wrote. He went to cite the figures of the National Gun Association. Its statistics are in many ways inadequate. First, it is very difficult to calculate the rates of ownership of weapons. The Agency used 8-year-old federal estimates and then used weapons purchase numbers to assume additional weapons in the United States. However, a spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms said that it was impossible to assess how ownership of weapons had grown because there was no national register of firearms. On January 13, 2021, General David Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for the use of marines for security purposes, and said to her, \"We are not working for you.\" However, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the estimated violent crime rate increased by 2.3 per cent in 2005 and 1.3 per cent in 2006. Counsel from both sides used statistics to argue their cases. In May 2005, the Neutral Research Service of Congress announced that there was insufficient evidence on either side: \"A recent study... none of the existing sources of statistics provide comprehensive, timely or accurate data to assess whether there is a causal link between firearms and violence.\"", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00323"}
