It used an uppercase \"i\" in place of the lowercase \"L\" in her last name.\u00a0When her name is spelled accurately on Twitter, the result is that the lowercase \"L\" reaches higher than the \"T\" in her last name. When misspelled with an uppercase \"i\", that faux-\"L\" only comes in at about the same height as the T.\nMoreover, Tlaib\u2019s Twitter following is around 277,000, a number more on par for a member of the U.S. House than the 30 followers the hoax account had amassed before it was removed.\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire!\n Share the Facts 2019-01-09 18:55:18 UTC   PolitiFact    1 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Pants on Fire  New U.S. Rep.
