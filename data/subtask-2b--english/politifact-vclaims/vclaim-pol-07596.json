What\u2019s the trend for immigrants lawfully living in the United States?\nSantorum\u2019s claim came up in a heated exchange with Detroit Free Press editorial page editor Stephen Henderson during the July 13, 2014, Meet the Press pundit panel. (We fact-checked another point from Santorum\u2019s talking points, too.)\n\"First off, we are accepting more legal immigrants than we ever have in the history ...\" Santorum said before some crosstalk. \"It's all chain immigration. And it's from the very countries that people have been coming from, because most of the immigration is tied to people who are already here.\"\nSo is he right about the United States accepting more legal immigrants than ever?\nLike other immigration figures, there are a few ways to slice the data. In some ways, he is right. In others, he is not.\nWe tried to ask Santorum which numbers he had in mind, but a spokeswoman for his group, Patriot Voices, could not be reached by email or Twitter.\nExperts directed us to the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Yearbook of Immigration Statistics, which publishes annual numbers of people obtaining lawful permanent resident status, or a \"green card,\" dating back to 1820 (see this chart for each year\u2019s tally). Green card recipients exclude people who come to the country for\u00a0short-term reasons, such as temporary work or studies.\nBy the raw numbers\nThe most obvious way to look at federal data is comparing raw numbers.\u00a0\nThe government admitted the highest amount of lawful permanent residents in 1991, at 1.827 million people, followed by 1990, at 1.536 million. Those years are higher than the most recent decade\u2019s annual admissions, which hovered around the 1 million mark. The 2013 total is 990,553, down 4 percent from 2012.\nThose peak years -- 1990 and 1991 -- are\u00a0atypical, the result of a\u00a0swath of people receiving green cards after winding through the process laid out in the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, said\u00a0Sumption, Migration Policy Institute director of international research. (That was the last time Congress enacted sweeping immigration reform, FYI.)\nThe third all-time highest year is 1907, with admissions of 1.285 million people. That tops the 2006 tally of 1.266 million people and any other recent year.\nLooking at individual\u00a0years, however, may not be as useful as the slightly broader trend,\u00a0Sumption said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom 2004 to 2013, average annual admissions were 1.076 million. During the other comparable time period of 1905-1914, before numerical quotes on immigration were in place, the average was 1.012 million people. That\u2019s slightly lower than our most recent decade.\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean Santorum\u2019s claim is in the clear.\nBy percentage of population\nPerhaps an even better comparison would be\u00a0legal immigrants admitted over time as a percentage of the American population, other experts told us.\nIn that case, the influx of immigrants was more dramatic at the turn of the century, when the country\u2019s population was much smaller.\n\"Since the total population was 92 million in 1910, compared with 308 million in 2010, admitting more than 1 million immigrants in a single year (and this wasn't atypical of the decade) was much more significant,\" said Susan Martin, professor and director of Georgetown University\u2019s Institute for the Study of International Immigration.\nLooking at the data in this light allows for analysis of the country\u2019s capacity for bringing in new people without risking competition in the labor market, Sumption said.\n\"Share of population is a better measure of the lived experience of immigration, the experience on the ground,\" she said.\nA big driver of the increase in recent years is the category for spouses of U.S. citizens, which isn\u2019t too surprising considering the growing global economy and the fact that many people who come to the country for temporary purposes of work and study marry U.S. citizens, she said.\nOur ruling\nSantorum said, \"we are accepting more legal immigrants than we ever have in the history\" of the country.\nOver the last 10 years, in raw numbers,\u00a0the United States has admitted slightly more immigrants into the country compared to any other 10-year period.\nBut when you factor in the new arrivals as a share of the U.S. population, 1905-14\u00a0is the leading time period. And when looking just at raw numbers, the United States admitted more immigrants in 1907, 1990 and 1991.\u00a0\nIn fact, the 2013 tally -- 990,553 -- would rank 20th all time.\nWe rate the claim Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07596"}
