In November, Republic Mark Harris received the advantage of 905 votes on Democratic Dan McCready. The Board claimed that the irregularities did not affect a sufficient number of votes to effect a change in the outcome of the race. To March. The National Convention Election Council has called for special elections in the Ninth Circuit, and the People &apos; s Democratic Party is raising funds to assist its candidate, who ends in September. In doing so, it misleads donors about the history of the race. An e-mail fundraiser on March 12 warns supporters of \"awful news.\" \"Democracy was forced into special elections in North Carolina, and the race is restricted!\" The e-mail says in a dark print. Did the race tie up? Only in the sense that no candidate has yet graduated from the primary stage of their party. We will also address whether Democrats have been \"forced\" to hold special elections. But first, some important dates: the initial elections will be held on 14 May and the general elections on 10 September. If no candidate receives 30 per cent of the votes in the primary elections, a second election will be held on 10 September, followed by general elections on 5 November. Now, let's talk about how we got here. The Democratic Party says \"forced\" to hold special elections - giving the impression that support for new elections was purely partisan. It wasn't. The Council of Elections of the National Council has a mandate to race for federal office throughout the state. In November, the Council was composed of nine members - four Republicans, four Democrats and one non-affiliated left-wing member - when it voted against the ratification of the results of the Ninth Regional Race. On January 26, 2021, in the North Carolina tweet, Secretary of State Ellen Marshall, Jenna Woodsworth stated, \"She has won state-wide races more than anyone else is likely to be alive.\" \u2022 1 February 2021, in January, the Tribunal reconstituted the Council with five members: three Democrats and two Republicans. In February, after a four-day hearing on the results of the fraud investigation, the reconstituted Council voted unanimously (5-0) to reverse the November results and to start new elections. The Council acted shortly after Harris, in a sudden step, expressed support for the holding of new elections. \"It has become clear to me that public confidence in the 9th District General Elections has been undermined to the extent that new elections are warranted,\" as reported by The New York Times. A decision of the Democratic Party of Dallas Woodhouse, Executive Director of the National Democratic Party, indicated that Democrats controlled the Electoral Council. Woodhouse said: \"The Republicans could not impose special elections, and they could not believe on their own.\" However, the State Act required four of the five members of the Council to approve new elections, according to Council spokesman Patrick Gannon. Therefore, the Republicans had an impact on the decision to call for new elections. The two members of the Republican Council voted for new elections shortly after Harris (Republican candidate) said that he also supported them. Moreover, on the day Harris called for new elections, Woodhouse said he supported Harris' decision. \"Today I ask everyone to pray for @Mark HarrisNC9. Today is a very difficult day for his family, his supporters and everyone @NCGOP. We will do our best to help improve the process and order in the future,\" Woodhouse tweet in February 21. In a statement issued the same day, the National Congress Party said \"We respect Dr. Harris' decision\" and thanked the Electoral Council. On February 26, after Harris withdrew from the seat dispute, the Republican Party issued another statement saying, \"This has been a cumbersome process for all concerned, and we support his call for new elections without ambiguity.\" Our NCP fund-raiser e-mail says \"Democracy forced to hold special elections\" in Congress's Ninth Circuit. The Democrats formed the majority in the National Convention Election Council, but the vote on ordering new elections was supported by the Republican members of the Council and the Republican candidate.
