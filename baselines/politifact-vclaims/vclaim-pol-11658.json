Fred Clark says Gov. Scott Walker cut technical college job training by $70 million", "text": "In the wake of six straight months of job losses, Republican Gov. Scott Walker put a priority on training workers to fill existing jobs in his Jan. 25, 2012, state of the state speech.\n\nTwo weeks earlier, Walker had announced a new council to brainstorm ways to get students better prepared for jobs.\n\nNot surprisingly, Democrats weren\u2019t buying what Walker was selling.\n\nIn the weekly Democratic Party radio address released Feb. 1, 2012, state Rep. Fred Clark of Baraboo pointed to the lackluster jobs numbers and criticized Walker\u2019s policies on education. He said students are \"already experiencing the effects of Governor Walker\u2019s damaging cuts to our universities and our technical colleges.\"\n\nClark continued: \"Governor Walker\u2019s talk about job training rings very hollow after he made more than $70 million in cuts to job training programs through our technical colleges.\"\n\nWe\u2019ve heard plenty about Walker\u2019s budget as it relates to public schools and the state university system, but little about the state\u2019s technical college system, which quietly serves 375,000 students.\n\nDid Walker cut technical college job training programs by $70 million?\n\nWalker\u2019s budget, approved by the Republican-controlled Legislature, did cut more than $70 million from general state aid to the technical college system. Precisely, it was $35.8 million each year for two years, or $71.6 million, according to the Legislative Fiscal Bureau.\n\nAfter years of steady state funding, Walker\u2019s plan amounted to a 30 percent reduction in state aid over two years. The reduction put the state aid at 1989 levels, according to tech college officials. The state budget also froze for two years the amount colleges could levy in property taxes for their budgets. That added to the budget challenge for administrators.\n\nBut there are some key additional facts to put this into context.\n\nThe state money is only about 12 percent of the revenue base for the colleges. Property taxes provide two-thirds of their budgets, and tuition and fees about one-fifth. So, it was a 30 percent cut of that narrow portion of their overall budget.\n\nAnd there is another set of numbers, unmentioned by Clark, that is important here.\n\nMost of the officials we spoke with acknowledged that another Walker budget move -- the collective bargaining changes that resulted in greater public employee contributions to state-paid health insurance and pensions -- had partially offset the aid cuts.\n\nStatewide, across the colleges, an estimated 60 percent of the aid cut was offset by those cost-cutting moves, according to Morna Foy, vice president of policy and government relations for the Wisconsin Technical College System. She noted the impact varied widely depending on the timing of labor contracts and other factors.\n\nSo the impact of the $70 million aid cut was significantly offset.\n\nAdditionally, Clark described the budget move as \"more than $70 million in cuts to job training programs.\"\n\nThe tech system\u2019s primary mission is largely \"job training\" through specialized coursework. But that\u2019s not all those schools do. They also provide general education, career counseling and skills training for already employed workers, among other services. So it\u2019s impossible to say the $70 million all came from job training programs.\n\nBecause nobody has catalogued the college-by-college impact of the aid cuts, we can\u2019t rule on whether the state aid cuts have damaged tech college education, as Clark said.\n\nBut our interviews with a sample of the 16 technical college districts found a modest but significant list of program cutbacks officials attributed to the state aid cut:\n\nNortheast Wisconsin Technical College lost about 5 percent of its workforce, including eight instructors, made some class sizes bigger and cut back on counseling for students and extra help for students who struggle, said Karen Smits, vice president of college advancement.\n\nWaukesha County Technical College discontinued two course programs, said Kaylen Betzig, executive vice president.\n\nMilwaukee Area Technical College consolidated a majority of classes at its downtown campus, according to Kathleen Hohl, spokeswoman for the college.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOfficials with the state tech system officials found that closing class sections and reducing the number of instructors was a common budget-balancing tactic, as was dipping into reserve funds, said Foy.\n\nSeveral officials mentioned waiting lists to get into programs such as nursing, and said the cuts have thwarted plans to try to get more students into class. In tough economic times, demand for tech classes rises, officials said. They also said Walker\u2019s budget spurred extraordinary numbers of retirements, causing the loss of experienced teachers.\n\nBut officials said the overall impact on classrooms was pretty modest or negligible.\n\n\"Students were able to get the experience in classroom we have always offered,\" Smits said, emphasizing that outside the classroom, the guidance cuts did mean less service.\n\nOur conclusion\n\nClark correctly quantified Walker\u2019s budget as having made more than $70 million in cuts to the technical college system. But it was a cut in general aid, not specifically to job training programs. And some of the cut was significantly offset by other changes in the budget, as was evident when officials told us the impact of the cuts was relatively modest.\n\nWe rate Clark\u2019s statement Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11658"}
