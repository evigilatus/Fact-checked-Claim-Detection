The lengthy missive, purportedly written by a \"senior gentleman in Mesa, Arizona,\" details a visit to a hospital made contentious by Medicare payment rules. The anonymous author claims to have experienced \"a medical situation that made it very clear that the \u2018Affordable Care Act\u2019 is neither affordable, nor do they care.\"\nThe full email, which is lengthy, is accessible in its entirety here. But briefly, the author relates what happened after he sought treatment for a suspected urinary-tract infection. After collapsing in a local urgent-care clinic, he was taken to a hospital. There, the medical staff feared he could be experiencing sepsis, a potentially serious inflammation caused by an infection, so they ordered a battery of tests, including one that could take a day or two to complete. As a result, they told him that he would need to stay in the hospital \"for observation\" rather than going home.\nHere\u2019s what happened next:\n\"I said, \u2018Doctor, correct me if I'm wrong, but if you admit me for observation, my Medicare will not pay anything. This is due to the Affordable Care Act.\u2019 He said, \u2018That's right, it won't.\u2019 I then grabbed for my bag of clothing and said, \u2018Then I'm going home.\u2019 He said you're really too sick to be going home, but I understand your position. This health program is going to hit seniors especially hard.\"\nThen another doctor came into the room. \"I said, \u2018Doc, you and I both know that under the Affordable Care Act anyone on Medicare who is admitted to a hospital for observation will be responsible for the bill. Medicare won't pay a cent.\u2019 At which point he nodded in affirmation. I said, \u2018You will either admit me for a specific treatment or you won't admit me.\u2019 Realizing he wasn't going to win this one, he said he would prepare my release papers.\"\nWe zeroed in on the core claim of this story, that \"under the Affordable Care Act, anyone on Medicare who is admitted to a hospital for observation will be responsible for the bill. Medicare won't pay a cent.\"\nWhen we looked into it, we found that Medicare does indeed have different reimbursement policies for patients who had been admitted to hospitals for observation as opposed to being admitted to treat a specific diagnosis. However, the email\u2019s author (and, if his recounting is accurate, each of the medical professionals he spoke to) were sorely misinformed about how Medicare rules operate.\nThe different reimbursement rates have to do with follow-up in-home care, not the original hospital stay. And crucially, the controversy over reimbursement for patients under \"observation care\" has nothing whatsoever to do with President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law, the Affordable Care Act.\nWhat is \u2018observation care\u2019?\nAccording to Kaiser Health News, \"hospitals provide observation care for patients who are not well enough to go home but not sick enough to be admitted. This care requires a doctor\u2019s order and is considered an outpatient service, even though patients may stay as long as several days. The hospitalization can include short-term treatment and tests to help doctors decide whether the patient should be admitted.\"\nBecause observation care is considered outpatient treatment, Medicare generally covers such visits, minus things like copayments and the cost of routine drugs. Where Medicare reimbursement significantly falls short is once an observation patient leaves the hospital.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Observation patients cannot receive Medicare coverage for follow-up care in a nursing home, even though their doctors recommend it,\" according to Kaiser. \"To be eligible for nursing home coverage, seniors must have first spent at least three consecutive days (or through three midnights) as an admitted patient, not counting the day of discharge.\"\nIn other words, assuming the email author\u2019s story actually happened, he shouldn\u2019t have had to worry about Medicare paying for his time in the hospital while under observation. Medicare would have paid, minus copayments and the like; there was no need for him to go home while in a fragile state just to avoid being responsible for the full cost of his care.\nIs this related to the Affordable Care Act?\nTying this policy to Obama\u2019s law is flat-out wrong.\n\"The Affordable Care Act has nothing to do with observation status,\" said Mary T. (Terry) Berthelot, a senior attorney with the Center for Medicare Advocacy. Several other health-policy experts confirmed that. The policy was established by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a division of the Department of Health and Human Services.\nWhile we\u2019re at it, we\u2019ll take a moment to debunk an additional Affordable Care Act-related claim included in the email.\nThe author writes that during a visit to his family practitioner, \"I told him that I had heard that the Affordable Care Act would no longer pay for cancer treatment for those 76 and older, is that true? His understanding is that it is true.\"\nIn reality, there are no such age limits. In October 2014, we rated Pants on Fire a chain email that claimed that under the Affordable Care Act, \"at age 76 when you most need it most, you are not eligible for cancer treatment. \u2026 \u00a0Cancer hospital will ration care according to the patient's age.\"\nOur ruling\nThe chain email said that \"under the Affordable Care Act, anyone on Medicare who is admitted to a hospital for observation will be responsible for the bill. Medicare won't pay a cent.\"\nThat\u2019s wrong. Medicare will cover the hospital stay, minus standard copayments and the like. Patients kept in the hospital under observation will not be able to receive Medicare reimbursements for follow-up care such as nursing-home stays, however.\nEven more inaccurate is the charge that this policy stemmed from the Affordable Care Act. In reality, this stems from a separate policy decision and had nothing to do with Obama\u2019s law. The claim is not only ridiculous but also dangerous, by urging ailing patients to leave the hospital for no good reason. This claim rates Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06267"}
