John Faso of the Hudson Valley.\nRep. Sean Patrick Maloney, a Democrat whose district neighbors Faso\u2019s, responded to that statement with a claim about the Republican replacement for Obamacare.\n\"I heard [Faso] say recently that too many people are on Medicaid,\" Maloney said. \"I'm just wondering which people he thinks we should throw off their insurance, because most people on Medicaid are kids, or seniors, or the disabled.\"\nThe replacement would have reduced federal Medicaid spending increases, a measure Democrats oppose. The bill is now in limbo after failing in the Senate last month.\nDemocrats in New York state want to preserve the Medicaid program, often citing the number of people who rely on it. But is Maloney right that most people in the program are children, seniors, or have a disability?\nNational numbers\nThe average monthly Medicaid enrollment in 2016 was nearly 71 million, according to the most recent estimates from the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\nThe agency\u2019s report breaks down the numbers:\n\n\n\u2022 28 million recipients were children.\n\n\n\u2022 5.7 million recipients were age 65 or older.\n\n\n\u2022 10.6 million recipients had a disability or were blind.\n\n\n\u2022 The remaining 28.1 million were adults below 65 without a disability or residents in U.S territories.\n\n\nA total of 44.3 million Medicaid recipients were children, seniors, or had a disability in 2016 according to the estimates. That\u2019s almost two-thirds of the Medicaid population.\nEnrollment data from 2014, the latest official count, shows those groups made up about 65 percent of the Medicaid population that year.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat distribution is not out of the ordinary, said Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law and policy at George Washington University.\n\"It\u2019s because of how the program is structured and it\u2019s because of who the people are,\" Rosenbaum said. \"For the elderly and the disabled, Medicaid is the means by which we do long term support for services in the United States.\"\nMedicaid is used by seniors who need long term care but cannot afford a private insurance plan to supplement Medicare, which does not cover long-term care. People with a disability also rely on the program to cover continuous care.\nThe share of children on Medicaid, meanwhile, is a reflection of how many children live in poverty, Rosenbaum said.\n\"Families know that if your children need insurance, you turn to the Medicaid program,\" Rosenbaum said.\nNew York numbers\nMaloney spoke in the context of national numbers, but the same claim would be true for New York state.\nThe average monthly Medicaid enrollment was\u00a06.1 million in New York as of April, according to the state Department of Health.\n\n\n\u2022 More than two million beneficiaries in New York are\u00a0children.\n\n\n\u2022 Another 700,527 either have\u00a0a disability or are\u00a0blind.\n\n\n\u2022 Another 639,488 are\u00a0people age 65 or older.\n\n\n\u2022 The remaining 2.8 million are\u00a0adults below 65 without a disability.\n\n\nThe three categories Maloney mentioned make up more than 3.3 million of New York\u2019s Medicaid enrollees, or about 55 percent.\nOur ruling\nMaloney said \"most people on Medicaid are kids, or seniors, or the disabled.\"\nThe word \"most\" may mean different things to different people. Not even dictionaries are clear, where meanings vary from \"the majority of\" to \"nearly all of.\"\nNationally, two-thirds of people on Medicaid are either children, seniors or disabled, according to data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\nFor us, we rate two-thirds as Mostly True.\n Share the Facts 2017-08-23 18:29:31 UTC   PolitiFact    5 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly True  https://wamc.org/post/congressional-corner-sean-patrick-maloney-65 \"Most people on Medicaid are kids, or seniors, or the disabled.\"    Sean Patrick Maloney Congressmember    Thursday, August 3, 2017 2017-08-03    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02979"}
