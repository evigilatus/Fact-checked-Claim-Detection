Kamala Harris, D-Calif., hit a lot of subjects during her campaign launch event in Oakland, Calif., on Jan. 27, from criminal justice to education to health care. At one point in her speech, Harris addressed the state of the economy.\n\"Let\u2019s speak truth about our economy,\" Harris said. \"Our economy today is not working for working people. The cost of living is going up, but paychecks aren\u2019t keeping up.\" (Watch it here around 1:21:00.)\nIs Harris\u2019s assertion about wages accurate? Broadly, no. Wages haven\u2019t soared over the past 40 years \u2014 or over the past five \u2014 but they haven\u2019t fallen behind inflation, either.\nWhen we contacted the Harris campaign, they offered news articles and studies that they said supported their position. However, most of this evidence for lagging paychecks was for particular slices of time and doesn\u2019t reflect the overall trend.\nMedian wages\nWages, once adjusted for inflation, have gone up both in the recent past and the longer term.\nFor economists, the primary statistic for measuring wages is median usual weekly real earnings for full-time wage and salary workers, age 16 and up. (\"Real\" is economic-speak for \"inflation-adjusted.\")\nThe following chart shows how that this measurement of wages has risen and fallen every quarter since 1979:\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that median wage growth has hardly been robust over the full four-decade span \u2014 workers experienced a gain of 6 percent above inflation. The financial crisis of 2008 had a big impact on Americans\u2019 sense of economic security.\nBut it\u2019s wrong to say that wages haven\u2019t outpaced inflation.\nThe increase has been particularly clear since 2014, which was when wages finally began climbing again after the losses of the Great Recession.\nBetween the second quarter of 2014 and the fourth quarter of 2018, inflation-adjusted wages rose by almost 8 percent, the data show. And wage gains have exceeded inflation for lower-income workers as well as higher-income workers, economists said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother measurement \u2014 average weekly earnings of private-sector production and nonsupervisory employees, adjusted for inflation \u2014 shows wages are also up in the shorter and longer term.\nIt\u2019s also consistent with annual rises after 2014 in median household income, a different statistical measurement.\nAll in all, various data sources agree that \"paychecks are keeping up with inflation,\" said Jed Kolko, the chief economist for the jobs site Indeed.com.\nWage stagnation among lower-income men\nOne subset of the workforce does fit Harris\u2019 description: Male workers in the lower half of the income spectrum. They account for a bit more than a quarter of the workforce.\nA tool created by the liberal Economic Policy Institute allows users to slice and dice federal wage data in a variety of ways. On the suggestion of Brookings Institution economist Gary Burtless, we looked at real hourly wages for working men at or below the median. The following chart shows wages at the 10th, 20th, 30th, 40th and median percentiles.\n\nThis chart shows that lower-earning male workers have seen their inflation-adjusted wages fall since 1973. Any real wage gains in 2018, which are not yet available, are unlikely to have been large enough to erase the decline since 1973, Burtless said.\nThat said, even these workers have seen their wages rise above the rate of inflation since at least 2014, following steep declines from the late 1970s to the early 1990s.\nBurtless said that this wage stagnation among lower-income men has been more than balanced out by gains among lower-income working women, which is why median wages overall have been rising.\n\"Viewed over the long time span, Sen. Harris\u2019s claim is correct for important segments of the working population,\" Burtless said. \"However, for wage earners more generally, the claim is wrong. Workers up and down the wage distribution have seen gains in real hourly pay since 1979, since 2000, and since 2014.\"\nOur ruling\nHarris said, \"The cost of living is going up, but paychecks aren't keeping up.\"\nOverall, wages have hardly skyrocketed, but they have risen faster than inflation since 1979, and especially since 2014. One subset of workers \u2014 men in the lower end of the wage spectrum \u2014 has seen their pay fail to keep up with inflation since 1973. However, Harris used general terms in her speech.\nWe rate the statement Mostly False.\nEditor's note:\u00a0We heard from several readers who disagreed with or had questions about this rating.
