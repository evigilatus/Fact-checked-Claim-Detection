Eventually, Petruna says, Transportation Security Administration agents searched the men\u2019s bags, and that when they allowed them back on, so many passengers left the plane that the flight was canceled.\n\"The terrorists wanted to see how the TSA would handle\" them, Petruna wrote. Only Fox News reported that the flight was canceled, Petruna says, and even they covered up the real \"threat.\"\nSpoiler alert: Petruna\u2019s report is a hoax, and not a new one either. The plane in question flew Nov. 17, 2009. In this fact-check, we\u2019ll explain this conspiracy theory\u2019s origin, then debunk it again for good measure.\nRemember chain emails?\nWe reached out to Dwayne Chassion, the man who posted Petruna\u2019s report on Facebook verbatim as it appeared in 2009, but didn\u2019t hear back. After we messaged him, Chassion deleted the post from his Facebook account.\nThe day after Flight 297, Fox News published a brief article from the Associated Press noting that Flight 297 departed for Houston two and a half hours late. According to the AP, \"a crew member asked a passenger to turn off his phone,\" the passenger didn\u2019t, and then the pilot returned the plane to the gate and \"asked (the passenger) to get off the plane.\"\nApparently, the man didn\u2019t speak English -- he and his group of 11 others were travelling with a translator -- and was looking at pictures on either his phone or a camera. The full group of 13 men got off the plane when the pilot returned to the gate, but, after some discussion with airport officials, the men were allowed back on the plane.\nThe two and a half hour delay pushed the original flight crew past mandated limits on hours worked. So AirTran subbed in a new flight crew and the plane left for Houston without incident -- minus 12 original passengers who, apparently uncomfortable, opted for later flights.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s marginally similar to Petruna\u2019s account, but the flight was not canceled and there certainly were\u00a0no Arabic curses or homemade pornographic film.\nWithin a few days of Flight 297, Petruna\u2019s email began circulating. Eventually, it reached the websites of conservative pundits Glenn Beck and Debbie Schlussel.\nWhen AirTran got wind of Petruna\u2019s email, they issued a point-by-point refutation. Long story short, Petruna wasn\u2019t even on the plane because his connecting flight was late. Petruna later admitted that he embellished the details, and that he intended the account only for \"a few friends.\"\nNone of the other passengers corroborated Petruna\u2019s assertion that the flight was canceled. One said that the passenger was Muslim -- but another said that he was actually speaking Spanish.\nAccording to a chaplain who arrived late but got on the plane after it returned to the gate, a passenger said that \"12 men of Middle Eastern appearance stood up and began dancing and singing in an Arabic dialect.\" But no other passenger corroborated that, either.\nEither way, Flight 297 got off the ground, and although it may have been a tense flight, Petruna\u2019s narrative was bogus then, and it\u2019s bogus now.\nOur ruling\nPetruna\u2019s 2009 account about a \"terrorist dry run\" leading to a canceled flight is going viral on Facebook. According to Petruna, 11 Muslim men were so uncooperative with their flight attendants that Flight 297 from Atlanta to Houston was canceled.\nBut the airline, other passengers from the flight, and the Associated Press all disagreed. Petruna, although originally scheduled for the flight, never boarded. In actuality, a man who may or may not have been of Muslim descent didn\u2019t speak English well enough to understand the flight attendant\u2019s instructions to turn off his phone.\nPetruna\u2019s account is outdated and riddled with inaccuracies.
