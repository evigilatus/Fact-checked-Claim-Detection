It\u2019s puzzling, however, when there is no record of the recent tragedy.\nThis seems to be the case with social media claims about a downed U.S. military helicopter.\nA Facebook post on June 6 asks users to acknowledge the deaths of 30 U.S. service members killed in Afghanistan.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"I am asking everyone to please take a moment of silence for the United States Navy Seal Team and their families,\" the post says. \"Their helicopter was shot down yesterday in Afghanistan and they lost 30 members of the team.\"\nThis attack was not lost in the news of 2020. It happened in 2011.\nOn Aug. 6, 2011, in what History.com referred to as the \"the costliest day in SEAL Team Six history,\" insurgents in Afghanistan shot down a Chinook transport helicopter, killing 30 U.S. service members and eight Afghans.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

Most were members of SEAL Team 6, the unit that carried out the mission to kill Osama bin Laden. (Officials said none involved in the raid died in the helicopter attack.)\nSo it really happened, but not \"yesterday.\"\nThis request for prayers has been circulating for years. Back in September 2017, the fact-checking organization Snopes.com explained that a nearly identical social media post was based on an outdated event.\nThe Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack.
