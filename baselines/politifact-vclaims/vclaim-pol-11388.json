Elliott Naishtat, Dawnna Dukes, Eddie Rodriguez, Mark Strama and Donna Howard.\n\nWe looked into that figure amid debate over the state\u2019s decision, which led the Obama administration to set in motion a phased-in cutoff of about $30 million in annual federal funds for the Texas Medicaid Women\u2019s Health Program, which has served tens of thousands of women a year since its launch in 2007.\n\nTo participate in the program, providers may not perform elective abortions. Since the program\u2019s start, dozens of Planned Parenthood health centers in Texas have qualified because they don\u2019t provide abortions and are legally separated from Planned Parenthood clinics that do.\n\nThat is changing, however. The Texas health and human services commissioner signed a rule in February 2012 barring entities affiliated with abortion providers from the program, which had the effect of disqualifying Planned Parenthood health centers that do not provide abortions. In response, the Obama administration declined to renew the program, arguing that Texas\u2019 new rule violates federal law by restricting women\u2019s abilities to choose their own caregivers. Perry has pledged to continue the program with state money \u2014 and without Planned Parenthood.\n\nUnder the program, participating women may receive health screenings, including a Pap smear, during the one family planning exam per fiscal year that the program covers. Examples of other screenings, related to family planning, that women can get during their visit: breast exam, pregnancy test, routine urinalysis, as well as testing for diabetes, sexually transmitted diseases and high blood pressure. Screenings are not covered outside of the annual exam.\n\nThe program also pays for birth control such as pills and condoms.\n\nNaishtat aide Nancy Walker told us by email that the \"nearly 45 percent\" figure came from \"multiple sources,\" including the Texas Health and Human Services Commission. She said the agency told her that in fiscal 2010, about 46 percent of clients in the state\u2019s Women\u2019s Health Program had received services from Planned Parenthood \u2014 which, we noticed, is a wider description than the legislators\u2019 reference solely to \"health screenings.\"\n\nCommission spokeswoman Stephanie Goodman told us that the state has not compiled data on where women in the program receive health screenings.\n\nAsked about the figure that Naishtat\u2019s aide cited from the commission, Goodman told us that the figure is based on a data analysis for fiscal 2010 \u2014 Sept. 1, 2009, through Aug. 31, 2010 \u2014 showing that of the 106,711 women who were served by the program, 49,162 received a service from a Planned Parenthood clinic. That\u2019s 46.1 percent.\n\nWe wondered, though, if it\u2019s correct to assume that all women in the program received health screenings, as the Democrats\u2019 article suggests. Goodman speculated that it might be, pointing out that all women in the program are entitled to an annual exam with health screenings.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, the Democrats\u2019 article leaves the impression that the referenced women solely depended on Planned Parenthood clinics for their screenings.\n\nThat might not be so. According to the commission\u2019s figures, 27,256 of the 49,162 Women\u2019s Health Program clients who were served by Planned Parenthood in fiscal 2010 also received a Women\u2019s Health Program service from a provider not linked to Planned Parenthood.\n\nIn a previous fact-check, we laid out a couple of possible explanations for those women being served by both Planned Parenthood and another type of provider.\n\nFor one, some portion of the 27,256 women may have had their exams and screenings at a Planned Parenthood clinic and then any tests processed at an outside lab. In those cases \u2014 and the state couldn\u2019t tell us how many of them there were \u2014 the only \"services\" that a woman would have received from a non-Planned Parenthood provider was lab testing. These women would not affect the Democrats\u2019 statistic, since they received their screenings at Planned Parenthood.\n\nBut under the program, it\u2019s also possible for women to switch providers during the year and receive another exam and screenings. So some portion of the 27,256 women may have received screenings from both a Planned Parenthood and a non-Planned Parenthood provider during fiscal 2010.\n\nAnd if the number were large enough, the percentage of women in the program who received their screenings exclusively from a Planned Parenthood clinic would be smaller than 46 percent.\n\nGoodman told us the state has not teased out the detailed data that would settle this issue.\n\nOur ruling\n\nThe Democratic legislators wrote that nearly 45 percent of women who received health screenings through the targeted family-planning program in fiscal 2010 had them at Planned Parenthood clinics.\n\nThat could be so, but we identified a couple of unsettled hitches.\n\nAccording to the state, 46 percent of the cited program\u2019s clients went to a Planned Parenthood clinic, but the state has no breakdown of the number of women who were screened overall, which is what the Democrats focused on. Also, the Democrats\u2019 statement implies that 46 percent of women rely on Planned Parenthood exclusively for screenings, but some women included in the 46 percent could have had screenings at a different kind of clinic, though (again) such details are not available.\n\nWe rate the claim Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11388"}
