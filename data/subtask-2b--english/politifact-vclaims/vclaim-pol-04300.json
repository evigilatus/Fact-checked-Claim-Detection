The state\u2019s Supreme Court heard arguments on the program in late July, and both sides are still awaiting for a ruling from the court.\nTotal enrollment\nConstant litigation hasn\u2019t stopped the program from turning into political ad material.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ad text claims that \"more than 450,000 students to benefit from school choice,\" citing a 2015 Lincoln County Register editorial.\nThat\u2019s the total number of students in Nevada (now closer to 467,000), but isn\u2019t anywhere close to the actual number of program applicants, which numbers around 7,800 at the most recent count.\nThe program is open to all students, but it is misleading to say that all of them will \"benefit\" from the program when the number of applicants is so small.\nLIBRE Initiative spokesman Wadi Gaitan said in an email that continuing legal uncertainty over the program means that the number of applicants is an \"incomplete\" barometer of who the program is helping, as presumably some parents are waiting for the dust to settle before deciding to enroll in the program.\nThe ad\u2019s vocal track differs from the text overlay as well, saying the program would help \"more than 450,000 students access better schools.\"\nAgain, there are no barriers for parents to apply for the program, but it\u2019s a bit far-fetched to assume that it will give literally every student in the state access to the school of their choosing given that tuition alone tends to cost more than the projected ESA stipend.\nAverage private school tuition in Las Vegas ranges from $8,700 to $9,600 a year, according to information from privateschoolreview.com. Demographic data released on program applicants shows that the majority of parents applying live in ZIP codes with higher-than-normal average household incomes (though income levels of applicants aren\u2019t disclosed).\nThe ad also cites a 2015 poll funded by the American Federation for Children, a conservative-leaning nonprofit that champions \"school choice.\" The group found that 71 percent of Nevada Hispanics polled favored the program.\nMore recent polling found that the program is still supported by voters, though not as strongly as the earlier poll suggests. A KTNV-TV 13 Action News/Rasmussen Reports poll from August found that Hispanic voters polled supported the program on a 47 to 35 percent basis, with 17 percent undecided.\nOur ruling\nA new ad from the LIBRE Initiative claims, \"Latinos in Nevada support Educational Savings Accounts, helping more than 450,000 students access better schools. But Catherine Cortez Masto is against it.\"\nThere\u2019s no question that Cortez Masto opposes the ESA program. But the ad exaggerates the size and scope of the program itself. Only a fraction of the state's 450,000 students have actually applied to be part of the program. The ad also accurately cites polls showing Hispanic support for the program, though recent polls show more modest support.\nBecause this ad is accurate but needs clarification,\u00a0we rate it Mostly True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/736fb02e-95c9-43ad-a5ea-ec50d5c4839b", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04300"}
