The letter contains a picture of two copies of the Wall Street Journal, which were put together. It appears that the newspapers are published from the same day with the same central story - but in starkly different addresses. Both newspapers contain a picture on the first page of the then Republican candidate Donald Trump shakes the hand of the then Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto. But, under the central image, the title of one newspaper says, \"Trump loosens his accent,\" while the other says, \"Trump speaks harshly on the wall.\" In Facebook, the text along the bottom says, \"The same paper, the same dates, different markets. What did you just learn? Are you feeling messed up yet? This article, which was shared on 18 March, was referred to as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation in its broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The same picture is original and presents two true versions of the Wall Street Journal of the same day - but the principal conflicting numbers represent editions of different times a day. The stories under the different headings are different. Colleen Schwartz, Deputy Chief Communications Officer of the Wall Street Journal, told Poletti Fuckett that the papers were from different times a day according to a printing schedule designed to ensure that the papers were delivered in time to the various readers. These issues have gone to different geographical locations, and another Wall Street Speaker has confirmed. \"There are various issues of the Journal published at different times during the evening to meet extradition requests,\" wrote Schwartz in e-mail. \"This often means that content is updated to reflect new reports on news and events as they evolve. Various editions can be distinguished by the number of stars in the upper right corner (under the letter L in the Journal). Sometimes newspapers undergo multiple revisions throughout the day and usually mark each of them to distinguish the edition. According to Schwartz, the Wall Street Journal sticks its prints to the number of stars in the upper right corner. The newspaper on the left of the picture has two stars and appeared earlier today, while the paper is shown on the right by four stars and published later today: various print editions of newspapers are often distributed to different geographical areas based on the time it takes to obtain new printed papers from printing facilities to their destinations in a timely manner. The two prints that are subject to scrutiny here contain two different versions of the story based on the fact that the news story itself has been evolving throughout the day. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 On January 11, 2012, Steve Severinghouse, Chief Communications Manager of the Wall Street Journal, said that it was difficult to identify him by looking at the exact images where both of those issues went. This is because the Wall Street Journal uses 26 printing stations throughout the country to print various copies and then distribute them in a timely manner. If, for example, the printing station in one area is located in an urban centre, readers inside the city are likely to receive a more modern later edition than those in a rural area that requires more time to travel on delivery trucks (and thus produce a print edition earlier). The Wall Street Journal describes various areas of circulation on its website. But why these different addresses? Well, a lot can change over a day. These stories were published in the printed version of the Journal on 1 September 2016 and covered the visit of Donald Trump on 31 August with former Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, as well as his interruption in the election campaign in Phoenix later that day. The final version of the online story is here with a time stamp from September 1, 2016 to 1:55 a.m., and the headline, \"Donald Trump Voss, is showing a deportation after Ayasing Tony at the meeting with Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto.\" An earlier version of the same story, found on the same website using the electronic archive tool \"Wyback Machine,\" August 31, 8:31 p.m., has a headline reading: \"Donald Trump Eze Tun on immigration, trading after meeting with Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto.\" According to reports, the meeting between Tramp and Nieto was reduced and hit by a cooperative tone, where Trump said at the joint press conference in Mexico that he and Pe\u00f1a Nieto had not discussed who would pay for the border wall he had proposed along the United States-Mexico border. This is why the previous version of the printed story and the online story emphasize the \"disregard\" of Trump from the tone. However, hours later at the rally - after Nito was allegedly tweeted that he had told Tramp Mexico that he would not pay for the wall - Trump had already changed his tone, reaffirming his harsh immigration stance and insisting that Mexico would pay for the wall. This is why the last version of the story (and its main title) is different; it contains news of further developments and the volatile Trump speech on the subject throughout the day. The edition was released on the left of the picture, which was confirmed by Schwartz, after the meeting in Mexico and published on the right after Trump gave his speech in Phoenix, although the papers used the same picture from the meeting between the two leaders. The edition was published on the left after Trump met with Mexican President Enrique Pina Nieto earlier today (and referred to the cooperative tone apparently in their discussion). The edition was published on the right after Trump gave a speech on immigration later today (and Tramp reiterated his position that he would force Mexico to pay for the construction of a wall along the Mexican-American border), \"Swartz wrote in an e-mail to Poletti Fact, \"The pictures represent two different editions, published at different times, with different stories according to the evolving news. The headlines represent the news at the time of publication - before and after his speech.\" Our shared image on the Internet shows two copies of the Wall Street Journal from the same day, but with two different addresses, and suggests that the organization distribute them to different markets to influence readers. While the picture is real and depicts two legitimate editions of the Journal, it actually presents two different versions of the paper produced at different times of the day and with different stories - one written before Trump gave a speech in a gathering and beyond. We have not been able to identify the geographical areas in which these papers have been circulated. However, we know that they have been distributed in separate regions, where different editions are produced in response to geographical delivery schedules. It is not accurate to say that the Wall Street Journal printed the same story with different addresses in an attempt to influence readers in different markets. The paper changed its headlines and story in response to the development of the news and in accordance with the timing of various publications. We value this allegation wrong.
