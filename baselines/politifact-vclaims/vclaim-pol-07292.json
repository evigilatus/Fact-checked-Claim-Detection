Here at PolitiFact, that\u2019s just the way we like it.\nThe Republican governor\u2019s new \"Wisconsin\u2019s Comeback\" plan -- a platform for his 2014 re-election bid -- includes a raft of rankings and statistics in its 62 pages (and 208 footnotes).\nMany of those rankings compare Walker\u2019s time in state government with that of his Democratic challenger, Mary Burke. She was state Commerce Department secretary under Gov. Jim Doyle from early 2005 to late 2007.\nAmong the comparisons: \"Since Governor Walker took office, Wisconsin ranks 11th in the nation in total business establishment growth compared to 47th in the years Mary Burke was Commerce secretary.\"\nWalker has argued tax cuts and other moves have helped spur small business growth.\nBut is he right on the rankings?\nBefore the Great Recession hit, was Wisconsin a bottom feeder for business establishment growth, compared to a near Top-10 showing now?\nDefining terms\nFirst things first: Let\u2019s define \"business establishment growth.\"\nIt\u2019s not a reference to job growth, or even new business creation, so it doesn\u2019t carry the weight those figures carry.\nThe phrase is a bit of jargon courtesy of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the agency that releases state-by-state data every quarter on employment-related measures.\nContrary to what the phrase may suggest, it\u2019s not about how many businesses have incorporated or otherwise formed, compared with how many have folded or otherwise died.\nInstead, \"business establishments\" means a business location, such as a new store or factory or farm. A single \"company\" can have multiple \"establishments,\" and new \"establishments\" can be opened by existing or new firms.\nThe data comes from a very broad census of employers and economists use it as one indicator of net business activity. Walker cites the data as backup for the claim, and we agree it\u2019s the right data to look at for his very specifically worded statement.\nChecking the rankings\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Godlewski\n\n\nstated on January 9, 2021 in Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all women that lost jobs (in the December jobs report), it was mostly Black and Latina women. In fact, white women gained employment.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Nusaiba Mizan \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe started with Burke\u2019s time at Commerce. Her tenure as the economic development chief coincides pretty well with the quarterly data collection, though it\u2019s not perfectly aligned. She started in February 2005 and left in November 2007.\nWe used the fourth quarter of 2004 as our starting point and the same quarter in 2007 as the end point. And we looked only at private-sector figures because both Walker and Burke have focused on economic growth in that sector.\nThe numbers showed a ranking of 47, just as Walker claimed. (It was one lower if you use the first quarter of 2005 as the baseline as a nod to the fact that Burke arrived mid-quarter).\nThe number of new establishments grew 1.3 percent in the three-year period from 2005 to 2007, ahead of only Michigan, Massachusetts and Maine. At the top of the heap were Arizona, Nevada and Florida, all with more than 14 percent growth.\nIllinois had the highest rank in the Midwest (11th).\nWalker compared Burke\u2019s time at commerce to what happened since he took office.\nThere is no data source we found that brings us to the present \u00a0-- or even close. That\u2019s because there is a long lag in reporting the quarterly data. (Information for the first quarter of 2014 is scheduled to be released Sept. 18, 2014.)\nWe looked at the most recent data, which covers 2011 through 2013, Walker\u2019s first three years in office. In this period, Wisconsin\u2019s growth rate (5.5 percent) was 11th highest, just behind Iowa (10th) and Illinois (9th).\nSo Walker\u2019s claim is on solid ground.\nTo be sure, the \"establishment\" rankings don\u2019t necessarily match up with separate ranking of net job gains in the state.\nDuring Walker\u2019s first three years, for example, Wisconsin was 35th for private-sector job growth, but 11th in establishment growth.\nThere\u2019s a much stronger correlation during the Burke era -- the state ranked 42nd in private job gains from 2005-\u201907, and 47th in pace of new business \"establishments.\"\nSo what should we read into these \"establishment\" growth numbers?\nIt\u2019s important to keep in mind the statistics make no distinction between the size of the firms being created and shutting down, according to economist Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist for Wells Fargo Funds Management in Menomonee Falls.\n\"If you have a lot of firms with one to four employees being created, you can get a good ranking for the number of businesses being created, but a bad ranking for total employment growth,\" he said.\nOur rating\nWalker\u2019s second-term blueprint said that since he took office, \"Wisconsin ranks 11th in the nation in total business establishment growth compared to 47th in the years Mary Burke was Commerce secretary.\"\nThe numbers, though not covering Walker\u2019s complete time as governor, are the latest available and support Walker\u2019s statement.\nWe rate the statement True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07292"}
