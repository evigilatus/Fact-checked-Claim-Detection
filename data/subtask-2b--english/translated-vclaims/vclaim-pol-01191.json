It's as fake now as it was at the time. The Republican Brad Blakeman, who was formerly a senior official of President George W. Bush's administration, published this picture of the palace in December 13, with these words: \"Blossy Palace is full of a high perimeter wall, a security cannon, and a carbon-powered 4x4 SUV. \"Do as I say, not as I do. \"Commander Belusi! Destroy that wall! Blakeman wasn't the only one sharing the picture. A group called President Trump Vance also published it, saying, \"The walls for her house are fine... but not us.\" More than 2,700 persons participated in this position. There's a big problem here. This isn't Belosi's house. It's an exclusive property that Forbes in 2013 called San Francisco \"the most expensive house.\" On January 10, 2021, in an article on Facebook, he said that Nancy Belusi had sent a letter to the Mayor of Portland after demonstrations there \"to demand that he stick to the proven democratic playbook.\" That's what it looks like in her actual home: Nancy Belucci's house in San Francisco. Note the absence of a wall. Our fellow fact-checkers in Snoops referred to the reality of the house surrounded by parachutes in February. This post is on Facebook and all it looks like is pants on fire.
