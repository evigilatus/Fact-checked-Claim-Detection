Terry McAuliffe wants a reluctant General Assembly to expand Virginia\u2019s background check to all prospective gun buyers. His call came in the wake of the Aug. 26 fatal shootings near Smith Mountain Lake of WDBJ-TV reporter Alison Parker and cameraman Adam Ward.\nThe law now requires all licensed gun dealers - those in the business of selling arms - to conduct a computerized check to determine whether a buyer has a disqualifying criminal record or mental health history. But casual sales and transfers between individuals are exempt.\nWe wondered whether Norment was right in saying only 2 percent of Virginia sales fall into that exempt category.\nJeff Ryer, a spokesman for the Virginia Senate Republican Caucus, told us Norment erred. \"As best we can determine, there are no state-by-state statistics available for the source of a firearm used in a crime,\" Ryer wrote in an email.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyer is correct. Neither the Virginia State Police nor the Virginia Firearms Transaction Center \"has any way of tracking the volume of private sales in Virginia,\" said Corinne Geller, communications manager for the state police.\nWe also should note that there are no conclusive national statistics about the percentage of guns that are sold without a background check.\nMany gun control advocates - including McAuliffe and U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va. - have said it\u2019s \"estimated\" that 40 percent of U.S. gun sales occur without background checks. But this claim is based on a small-sample survey of purchasers that\u2019s almost 21 years old and counts some guns that were brought before a national background check law took effect. As we\u2019ve reported, even the researchers of that study say they \"don\u2019t know\" if their findings are relevant today. There\u2019s been no updated national study.\nA final note: The killer of Parker and Ward bought his gun legally and passed a background check, according to law-enforcement officials.\nOur ruling\nNorment said \"only about 2 percent\" of gun sales in Virginia are not subject to background checks. A spokesman says Norment erred, and we agree. No one knows how many guns are sold privately in Virginia or nationwide these days. Statistics aren\u2019t available.\nWe rate Norment\u2019s statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05814"}
