This will be the biggest tax cut in history. In the history of our country.\"\n\n\u00a0\nBut is it? Tax experts say no. (The White House did not respond to our inquiry.)\nThe current tax proposal is still a work in progress, but the Senate budget resolution allows it to reduce federal revenues by $1.5 trillion over 10 years. An estimate by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget suggests that, when all is said and done, the reduction in tax revenues will increase to $2.2 trillion over 10 years.\nSo based on what we know now, the tax proposal will probably amount to between $150 billion and $220 billion per year.\nThat doesn\u2019t stack up as the largest cut ever.\nThe Treasury Department has published a list of the biggest tax bills between 1940 and 2012, measured not only by contemporary dollars but also by inflation-adjusted dollars and as a percentage of gross domestic product \u2014 two metrics that experts say give a sense of scale.\nDepending on what projection of the current bill you use and what yardstick you measure it by, at least one tax bill on the Treasury list, and possibly others, were larger.\nHere\u2019s the list by inflation-adjusted dollars:\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTax bill\n\n\nInflation-adjusted dollars \n\n\n\n\nAmerican Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (enacted in 2013)\n\n\n$321 billion\n\n\n\n\nTax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010\n\n\n$210 billion\n\n\n\n\nEconomic Recovery Tax Act of 1981\n\n\n$208 billion\n\n\n\n\nCurrent tax proposal\n\n\n$150 billion - $220 billion\n\n\n\n\nRevenue Act of 1964\n\n\n$64 billion\n\n\n\n\nRevenue Act of 1945\n\n\n$60 billion\n\n\n\n\nRevenue Act of 1978\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$55 billion\n\n\n\n\nRevenue Act of 1948\n\n\n$38 billion\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nAt least the 2013 bill -- and possibly the 2010 and 1981 bills -- exceeded the current bill in inflation-adjusted tax cuts, depending on what figure you project for the current bill.\nAnd here are the tax laws ordered from highest to lowest as a percentage of GDP:\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTax bill\n\n\nPercentage of GDP\n\n\n\n\nEconomic Recovery Tax Act of 1981\n\n\n2.89 percent\n\n\n\n\nRevenue Act of 1945\n\n\n2.67 percent\n\n\n\n\nRevenue Act of 1948\n\n\n1.87 percent\n\n\n\n\nAmerican Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (enacted in 2013)\n\n\n1.78 percent\n\n\n\n\nRevenue Act of 1964\n\n\n1.6 percent\n\n\n\n\nTax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010\n\n\n1.31 percent\n\n\n\n\nCurrent tax proposal\n\n\n0.8 percent-1.2 percent\n\n\n\n\nRevenue Act of 1978\n\n\n0.8 percent\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nBy this measurement, at least six bills cut taxes by more than the current proposal. A seventh, the Revenue Act of 1978, is essentially tied with the current proposal as a percentage of GDP.\nThe Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has noted that an even earlier tax cut, from 1921, accounted for 1.1 percent of GDP.\nThe group added in a blog post that \"if President Trump wanted to pass a tax cut that exceeds the record 2.9 percent of the economy in 1981, it would cost roughly $6.8 trillion over ten years.\"\nNo formulation of the current proposal is close to that.\n\"Unless lawmakers scrap their current plans for tax reform and start over from scratch, it\u2019s simply implausible to claim that this legislation will provide the largest tax cut in U.S. history,\" said Joseph J. Thorndike, director of the Tax History Project at the group Tax Analysts.\nOur ruling\nTrump said the GOP tax plan he is supporting is \"the biggest tax cut in U.S. history.\"\nEven the most expansive estimate for the current proposal\u2019s tax cut is exceeded by the 1981 tax cut in inflation-adjusted dollars.
