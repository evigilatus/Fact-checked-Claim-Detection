The post\u00a0 is an image of a Jan. 23 tweet that was shared more than 30,000 times on Twitter and reads:\u00a0\n\"Soybean price is down 70 cents per bushel in the last two days. Corn is down 50 cents per bushel in two days. For those who don\u2019t know, a small farmer like me working 1,000 acres just lost $100,000 on a 200 bushel per acre average corn crop thanks to Biden\u2019s executive orders.\"\nThe Facebook post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

But experts PolitiFact spoke to said they saw no evidence that any of Biden\u2019s orders, which have the force of law, were the cause of the changes, given that prices have been running high.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not clear which of Biden\u2019s early orders the post might be blaming.

The experts said the drops were not surprising, given that prices for both commodities had been running high, and that multiple factors were at play.\nWe rate the post Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19238"}
