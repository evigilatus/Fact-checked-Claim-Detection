Bruce Runner during the historical impasse in the state budget. Now, I went out with an interactive announcement attacking Bill Daley because he didn't take a similar position during the two years that Illinois worked without a budget after serving on the Republican Governor's Transition Team after the 2014 elections. The ad, a web site in the \"Danger\" mode, calls for viewers to play \"Dale Troubles\" and \"Learn more about Bill's background.\" The answer to all categories is, of course, \"Who's Bill Daley?\" One of them, entitled \"The Strange Budget Crisis,\" provides a description that calls for deeper scrutiny. \"After co-chairing the Bruce Runner Transition Team and writing the blueprint for four years of crisis and destruction, he stood by his side and remained silent,\" says Daly, at the same time, commending his failure to protest against Ronner's actions in office and accusing him of charting the path of the late Republican now. Irrespective of this headline logic, Mendoza's claim has made us question the recommendations made by Dali and other co-chairs of the Ronner Transition Group in their report. There is no need to reformulate the budget crisis here. As we have pointed out in previous fact-finding exercises, both Ronner and the Democrats share the responsibility to do so. But we were curious whether the transition report itself could be considered a \"blue print\" of the policies that Ronner was pushed into during those troubled years. The short answer is no. In the Mendoza Declaration linking Daly, the son of one former mayor of Chicago and another brother, Brunner, who has been defeated for some time now, \"the subjects of the gender campaign.\" J.P. Pritzker. In another \"danger\" tile, she also highlights a $1 million donation from Daily recently received from a billionaire hedge fund, Ken Griffin, a major financial supporter not only of Ronner, but also of the outgoing mayor, Ram Emmanuel. Griffin's contact provides paper for Mendoza's well-documented confrontations with Ronner on how the state pays its bills, which she converted, fed a state-wide reputation as a good director of state finances who can work across the corridor in Springfield to get things done. However, her claim that Daly somehow paved the way for Ronner's role in the long-standing budgetary impasse in the state lacks substance. First, the report of the Transition Team was not drafted by Dali alone, as suggested in the Mendoza Declaration. Instead, he was one of a group of 28 co-chairs who signed the document after consulting with business and community leaders throughout the state. The colleague of the mayor of Chicago and Willie Wilson was also a co-chair, together with the former Goof Government. Jim Edgar, the Republican who recently served on the Britzker Democratic Transformation Team. Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" \u2022 26 January 2021, and more than that, there is no evidence that the contents of the report guided Ronner in his decision to engage in a two-year altercation with the Democrat-controlled General Assembly, which hampered the ability of the State to pay its vendors on time and jeopardized funding for everything from social services to higher education. A newspaper article published immediately before Ronner took the oath of his transition team report described it as a little more than a copy of \"to a large extent the themes of the public campaign.\" Indeed, the report itself indicates that the Panel was \"not in a position to make specific recommendations on budgetary solutions.\" Transitional reports such as Ronner's usually lack details, making Daley's role in the process largely celebratory. \"I read in this what you want to read inside if the details are not there,\" said Charles N. Wheeler III, who runs the public affairs reporting programme at the University of Illinois-Springfield and covers state policy for decades. We asked the Mendoza campaign to show us where the report proposed controversial policies that Ronner later sought to implement in a way that contributed to the stalemate. A Government spokesman pointed out several passages highlighting the need to improve the business climate in the State under the new administration, and only one suggested that the Governor take any form of concrete action. This passage urged Ronner to consider lowering workers' compensation rates, but the only details mentioned were the proposals that had reviewed existing legislation to ensure the compatibility of Illinois with similar mandates and the appointment of \"qualified commissioners and arbitrators in the area of workers' compensation.\" Ronner pressed for major changes in the compensation system for State employees after he took office, but what he sought - and did not receive from a democratic legislature - was mentioned only in the decision on the transition associated with Daali. Among the controversial parts that Ronner called his agenda which was not included in the report were: freezing property taxes, imposing time limits on legislators, determining prevailing wages and establishing local \"right to work\" zones. Even the vague reference in the report to the reduction of workers &apos; compensation rates did not amount to an automatic non-start with the Democrats, who in 2011 approved a bill aimed at reducing these costs. What later gave rise to controversy between Democrats was Ronner &apos; s demand for comprehensive change before giving this measure a chance to work. When Mendoza was asked to explain how the points linked the priorities outlined in the report broadly to the decisions subsequently taken by Ronner as the executive head of the State, her spokesperson sent us a response that essentially repeated the original claim of the Declaration. The Governor, Susana Mendoza, states that as part of the Transitional Governor's team, Bill Dale wrote \"the scheme\" for what she calls \"four years of crisis and destruction.\" Helped Daley prepare a report setting out the overall priorities of the forthcoming Runner administration on a long list of issues. However, there is no evidence that the document, which was heavy on generalities but very clear on concrete policy recommendations, was guided by Ronner &apos; s subsequent actions, which contributed in two years to the stalemate with the democratic-controlled General Assembly on how to govern the State. * Mendoza's claim that Daly's setting the framework for Ronner's role in the long-standing budgetary impasse summarizes a widespread accusation of guilt through association.
