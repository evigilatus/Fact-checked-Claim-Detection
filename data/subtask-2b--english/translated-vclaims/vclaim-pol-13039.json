We will see whether those goals have been achieved sometime after 2014 when the key provisions become effective. Until then, all we have are expectations. (S) Rob Portman, however, recently focused on here and now. Even before the big provisions begin to expand health coverage to almost all Americans, Portman says he hears from employers that their premiums are rising due to the law, called the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. These high costs make it difficult for them to recruit new staff, he says. \"The legislation enacted last year by Washington made it difficult to employ because it increased the cost of hiring someone,\" said Portman to journalists on 3 May, when he revealed the \"job plan,\" which included the proposal to retract the health law. A few days later, Portman said small businesses told him health-care reform is already paying for it. \"People tell me 15 and 16% increase,\" he said. Some provisions of the Health Care Act entered into force last fall and early this year. Employers now have to register dependent child workers, if parents wish to add them, until they reach the age of 26. The new policies must pay for preventive care without taking advantage of the employee &apos; s discount. Health plans cannot limit the value of life-long medical care they will cover. Each of these may look like they'll make insurance premiums jump. \"It's a fundamental principle of economics: if you add more things, it'll cost more,\" said Robert Zerklbach, spokesman for American health insurance schemes, the health insurance lobby. However, both conservative business groups and liberal advocates say that these increases were generally small. Adding a 24-year-old child to your health coverage may require you to have a family plan if you only have individual or marital coverage, so your employer will have a higher cost if you pay part of your insurance. However, young people usually do not use many medical services and incur very low health-care costs. Similarly, full coverage of preventive care is required only for new policies. With regard to raising the age limits of the plan, Bill Robertson, head of the Concord Benefits Planning Agency, a benefit adviser from Lake County, near Cleveland, said that it rarely happens now that the ceiling tends to be $1 million or more. \"I've been at work 36 years,\" he said, \"I've been at business 36 years.\" I have cumulative insurance for 50,000 people. I've seen one claim go over the cover.\" In total, these new requirements added an average of 2.5 per cent this year to the cost of health insurance provided by the employer, according to the Lockton Benefit Package model, a division of Lockton Cos, a large private sector-owned insurance broker. A study by Mercer, an international consulting firm, last fall determined the average cost increase due to immediate changes of 2.3 per cent, with small companies (less than 500 workers) accounting for an average of 3 per cent, and large companies (5,000 workers or more) accounting for 1.9 per cent. Finally, according to the Ohio Insurance Department, which regulates insurance companies and must approve many price increases, premiums have increased by approximately 15 per cent, but only 2 to 3 per cent are due to the requirements of the Affordable Care Act. We asked Portman to expand his claim. Referring to a study by the Congressional Budget Office, he said that fewer than 800,000 people were expected to hold jobs as a result of health-care legislation. However, after 2014, the study did not mention this number of jobs. Instead, during the hearing at which the director of the organization testified, the Republicans in Congress cross-readed the number - which was reported to be 650,000 or 800,000 - at a variety of times. Separate analyses by PolititFact, Factcheck.org and Washington Post found problems in the GOP interpretation. The local community office never stated that these jobs would be lost because of the high cost of employers. Instead, the Office of Community Action discussed a slight reduction in the workload of the economy, some of which may result from leaving people in the labour force because they no longer need to stick to a job simply to maintain their health insurance. Poletti Fukte ruled that an allegation that was almost identical to Portman &apos; s report, based on the report of the Central Trade Bureau, was false. But Portman told us that he based his claim on more than the study conducted by the Central Bureau. As he has said several times recently, this is what Ohio employers tell him. We've been provided with names. Fredon Corp, a family-owned micro-mechanism company in Mintor, had 78 employees and avoided dismissal during the economic downturn, as Alison Scott, the chief finance officer, said. Now he's planning to start hiring. The high cost of health insurance made employment a greater challenge. \"She certainly goes to your overhead,\" she said. The company faced annual premiums increases of 10% -- an increase in the insurance industry due to inflation, population ageing and the high use of medical services by all Americans. However, Fredon quoted an increase of 22.6 per cent this year for the same medical coverage in Ohio as in 2010. \"They said they had no idea what would happen in the future and they should cover their costs,\" said Scott. Lisa Dembrio Nelson, the insurance broker at Friedon, from the Trajectory Service Right Company, said that the increase had fallen to 15 per cent, and Scott, whose account was confirmed by Nelson, said. \"What the transporters say to us,\" Nelson said, \"is that it's the warrant.\" She said, \"It's not our fault, it's our credentials,\" she said. However, Faridun is planning to expand its workforce anyway. So did the highest premiums have an impact? Of course, Scott said. This will not prevent employment, but it has led the company to reassess \"how much we employ, at what stage.\" We contacted the Ministry of Medicine and asked about the price increases needed to cover the mandates of the Affordable Care Act. \"At this point, health-care reform has had little impact on pricing, and it is too early to determine the impact in the future as the main provisions of the legislation do not enter into force for nearly three more years,\" said Ed Byers, spokesperson for the medical institution. He had lost his understanding of why Faridun and her broker had a clear impression that much of their increase was due to health reform mandates. Portman's office also recommended to other companies. Three of them agreed to conduct interviews: PR machines operating in Mansfield, Mount Laser in Mayamsburg, and Rbisco in Greenville. Zoe Romanchuk, Vice-President of the Public Relations Machine Business, said that the premiums had risen by only 3 per cent this year in her 55-person company, but expected a significant increase next year. The company saw an increase of 30 per cent in 2009, which preceded the health reform. She said other companies tell her that she was hit by 30% and 40% this year. Did this work out for her company? She said, \"Not yet.\" The president of Mond Laser and CEO Larry Dosser said that the premiums increased by 20% this year, after they saw increases in premiums. The company was paying 100 per cent of the costs of its labour policy but, as Dosser said, reduced its share to 90 per cent. Ninety per cent of Mund Laser's business involves the manufacture of microscopic parts for medical equipment manufacturers, which will face a special tax beginning in 2013 to help offset the cost of health repairs. The White House says that the tax will not be harmful because the medical equipment industry will thrive on new patients receiving health insurance, but Dosser fears that it will force its customers to move abroad, which will affect his work. So is Mond Laser slowing him down? At all, Desser said. It plans to grow to about 50 employees at the end of the year, \"because I refuse to be dictated by these kinds of policies.\" Then there is Rbisco, a company designed to manufacture and manufacture minerals. They faced a 23 per cent increase in their 20 employees &apos; insurance premiums, but reduced them to 10 per cent to 12 per cent by raising the deductible amount. This means that workers were also beaten at higher costs than their own funds, according to Taise Baker Bowman, the head of the company. Did that affect recruitment? Bowman said that every new expenditure is painful. She said that her company could use two or three other agents, but \"we will not (rent) at this stage.\" \"We'll put this discussion aside for as long as possible.\" Why do employers have the impression that health-care reform is responsible for the two-fold increase in infection rates? Gary Claxton, Vice-President of the non-profit and non-partisan Kaiser Family Foundation and the authority in the insurance market, presented this theory: \"If you are a believer and you want to blame someone else, won't you blame the government?\" How can we evaluate Portman's statement? We have a CBO report, which points to an erroneous assessment. We have assessments from the insurance industry and regulators, which set premium increases due to the new law at about 2.5 per cent. And we have the companies that Portman cited. Fredon Corp says he didn't reduce recruitment, but he's reassessing how much. The insurance company maintains that health-care reform has had little impact on pricing. The PR machine is still hiring. Mond Laser doesn't slow him down, because that would be a surrender. And Rbisco will delay the new recruitment because every new cost will hurt -- including insurance. After considering large amounts of data and studies, and talking to industry and association experts and contacting people who run small companies, we found that Portman's statement contained some elements of truth. However, there were too many monetary facts indicating the other direction, and misleading or very confusing assumptions about the cause of the two-digit premiums - and very few jobs lost or the actual slowdown attributable to health reform - so that the Treaty-O-Meter could refer to any other direction that was hardly correct.
