In fact, a picture of children in prisons was used by other fake media to show how bad (dirty) we are, but it was in 2014 during the years O. Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTromp) 26 November 2018... children from parents, like Bush, etc., because this is politics and law. I tried to keep them together, but the problem is, when you do, huge numbers of extra people break into the border. So with Obama's fragmentation, it's okay, but Trump's not. This summer, a picture of detained children was widely disseminated on social media, which was faked by some liberal journalists and activists as a detention in 2018. The rest of the allegations contained in the Tramp tweet are inaccurate and do not tell the whole story. The White House did not respond to the request for comment. The differences in family separation by Obama and Tramp of the Ministry of Justice in April introduced \"non-tolerance\" as a new policy under the Trump administration, not as carried over from previous administrations. This policy calls for the prosecution of all adults referred by immigration authorities for violation of immigration laws. As a result of this policy, more than 2,300 migrant children were separated from their parents on arrival at the border this summer. The children were placed under the guardianship of health and humanitarian services in the United States and the parents were brought to trial. Previous administrations have also separated children from adults who arrived with them in the United States. However, the immigration experts said that these separations were relatively rare and were not close to scale under the Trump administration. On February 1, 2021, Tom Cotton mentioned in an interview with Fox and friends \"Many of these arriving immigrants, we have no way of checking their background for either health or security.\" By Miriam Valverdi, 3 February 2021, speaking on behalf of the Ministry of Internal Security, which oversees border enforcement, Paulette Fact told the Obama administration that the number of separated families at the border is not counted. The Obama administration has begun to try border-crossers who have been deported at least once, but few have crossed with children, and thus the case has not become apparent, and Andrew Sealy, head of the Institute of Migration Policy, told us to check the facts earlier. \"There was some separation of children and some decline by immigrant advocacy groups about it, but the numbers were very limited,\" said Seeley. While Obama's administration generally refrained from prosecuting adults who crossed the border with their children, Trump's administration chose to prosecute adults, even when they had children with them, Peter Margolis, a professor of immigration law and national security law at Roger Williams University Law School, said in June. \"This is an option -- an option fundamentally different from that made by Obama and the two former Presidents of both parties.\" The George W. Bush administration had a program, the simplification process, which referred migrants who had illegally crossed the country to prosecution, but made exceptions for adults travelling with children. Trump's tweet also claimed that family separation was done \"because this is politics and law.\" There is no law requiring the separation of all families once they have crossed the border. In June, National Security Minister Kirsten Nelson quoted: \"We do not have a policy of separating families at the border. A period.\" The \"non-tolerance\" policy does not explicitly stipulate that parents and children must be separated, but this was the result of the parents being brought to trial. Katie Waldman, speaking on behalf of the Ministry of National Security, Paulette Fuckett, was told that families were separated for one of three reasons: when officials could not prove the custody relationship, when they believed that the guardian might pose a threat to the child, or when the guard was detained for trial. Trump also claimed that he \"try to keep them together.\" In June, Trump insisted that he had no executive power to end family separations, but he did so later after increasing pressure and criticism on separations. We assessed Trump's claim that he could not end family separation. \"We had exactly the same policy as Obama's administration.\" That's not true. Families were separated at the border as a result of a new Trump policy called \"Intolerantness.\" There were some family separations under Obama's administration, but experts say that they were not on a tramp-wide scale and that they were relatively rare. We also appreciate Trump's false establishment.
