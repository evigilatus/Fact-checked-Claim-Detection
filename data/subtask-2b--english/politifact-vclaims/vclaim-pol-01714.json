Eggers wrote a story, which begins: \"Republican Troy Balderson clings to a narrow margin in last night\u2019s special election for Ohio\u2019s 12th Congressional district, underscoring the impact voter fraud can have in key elections around the country,\" Eggers wrote.\nEggers raised the prospect that people were impersonating dead voters, claiming that \"72 voters over the age of 116 who \u2018live\u2019 in Balderson\u2019s district cast ballots in the 2016 election.\"\nThe Breitbart article links to a list of voter IDs of Ohioans whose birthdates are listed in 1901 or earlier. Eggers sent us the same information when we reached out to him.\u00a0\n\"Take into account the fact that there were 170 voters in the state of Ohio that were listed as older than 116,\" American Journal Review wrote. \"These names still sat in Ohio\u2019s 12th Congressional district\u2019s rolls when the data was collected by GAI in August of 2017.\n\"This is equivalent to 10 percent of the margin that Balderson is currently leading by, without provisional ballots. More than 72 percent of Ohio voters over 116 years old who are \"living\" in the district Balderson is running in voted in the 2016 election\u2026\"\nConsidering the fact that the world\u2019s oldest living person is 115 years old, and that the vote counts of the Democratic and Republican candidates were separated by roughly 1,700 votes the day after the election, we wanted to look into the allegation of the American Journal Review article that there were \"major signs\" of voter fraud.\n(At the time of this story\u2019s publication, it appears that Republican Troy Balderson leads Democrat Danny O\u2019Connor by 1,564 votes, but some absentee and provisional ballots still need to be counted. The results will be sent to the Ohio Secretary of State on Aug. 24. Balderson and O\u2019Connor will face off again in November.)\nIndeed, there are 170 voters in the district listed with birthdays from 1901 or earlier. But the story builds a misleading impression by tying that fact to \"voter fraud,\" where there is no evidence that dead people or people over 116 years old voted in the race.\nThe story overlooks a plausible explanation for turn-of-the-century birthdays of 170 registered voters: Ohio didn\u2019t require citizens to provide their dates of birth when registering to vote until 1974.\nJan. 1 holds the spot\nThe list of Ohio voters shows 170 voter IDs and corresponding dates of birth, all of which are listed as being in 1901 or earlier.\nBut if you look closely, you\u2019ll notice that almost all of the voters\u2019 dates of birth are listed as one of three dates: Jan. 1, 1800, Jan. 1, 1900, or Jan. 1, 1901. \u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe office of Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted responded to several misleading stories about the special election in a press release. \"State law has not always required Ohioans to provide their date of birth when registering to vote,\" they wrote. \"Prior to June 1974, when House Bill 662 was passed requiring date of birth to register to vote, county boards of election used placeholder dates. This is why some registrations have dates like 1900 or 1800 listed.\"\nHusted doubled down in a tweet: \"No one 116 or older is voting in Ohio elections. Voters who registered when DOB wasn't required have a placeholder date as their DOB. Often the year 1900 was used.\"\nEnough misinformation: Time for the facts. No one 116 or older is voting in Ohio elections. Voters who registered when DOB wasn't required have a place holder date as their DOB. Often the year 1900 was used. https://t.co/RMMuIh29tf\u2014 Jon Husted (@JonHusted) August 13, 2018\n\nOutside elections experts said Husted\u2019s explanation was valid.\n\"Husted\u2019s explanation is entirely credible and unremarkable,\" said Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School.\nThe practice isn\u2019t unique to Ohio. Other states have used placeholder dates of birth.\nIn New Jersey in 2005, the birthdates of seven voters were listed as Jan. 1, 1880. A Brennan Center for Justice report concluded that the date \"is most likely a system default for registrations lacking date-of-birth information.\" \u00a0\nThe fact that only 170 out of 8 million registered voters (0.002 percent of voters) in Ohio had incorrect birthdates is \"pretty good,\" Levitt said.\nOur colleagues at Factcheck.org, debunking a similar article, actually spoke with some Ohio voters listed as 116 or older.\n\"Although we couldn\u2019t talk to everyone registered in the 12th District who was listed as being born in 1800 or 1900, we did talk to some of them and can confirm that they are living, breathing, eligible voters,\" Factcheck.org wrote. \"Charles Hacker, of Mansfield, Ohio, is one of them. He registered to vote in 1973, according to the voter roll, and his birthdate is listed as Jan. 1, 1800. But he was actually born in 1944, he told FactCheck.org in a phone interview. He\u2019s 74 years old.\"\nOur ruling\nAn article from the American Journal Review\u00a0claimed,\u00a0\"Red Alert: Major Signs of Voter Fraud Uncovered In Ohio,\" and went on to say that \"170 voters in the state of Ohio that were listed as older than 116.\"\nThe reality isn\u2019t as fishy as the headline sounds.\nThe story manipulates an oddity about Ohio\u2019s voter database into a misleading narrative about voter fraud. While there are 170 voters listed as over 116 years old, that is almost definitely not their real birthdays.\nThat\u2019s because those voters likely registered to vote in Ohio before 1974, when they weren\u2019t required to provide their date of birth. Because the voting record lacked these voters\u2019 dates of birth, placeholder dates from 1800 and 1900 were used, the state\u2019s Republican secretary of state said.\nThe statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.\nCorrection Aug. 22, 2018: After we published this item, we heard from Eggers that his point wasn't accurately covered in this fact-check. As a result, we added additional information from Eggers and clarified the point of this fact-check, which was a suggestion made by some bloggers that Ohio's voter rolls were a sign of voter fraud.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01714"}
