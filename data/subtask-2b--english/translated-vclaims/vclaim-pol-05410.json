This included Trump &apos; s comments on women and the age of John McCain, as well as accusing him of mocking a disabled reporter with a physical disability, which Trump denied. Trump refired that Bush was a dirty mouth, but he got away with it. \"Two days ago, he would take off his pants and the moon everyone,\" said Trump in February 13. \"That's okay -- no one reports it. He wakes up and says so. And then he told me, \"Oh, my language was a little harsh.\" Did Bush really say something like that, and did the press ignore it? Trump's account of the facts is very selective. We referred to the article by Matt Fizer in the Boston Globe a few days before the beginning of New Hampshire, Bush's comment on fucking Trump's spokesman. The main point of the article was that Bush had to work well in New Hampshire -- or later this month in South Carolina -- or that he would face pressure to end his campaign. \"Sitting on his campaign bus - the laptop, turkey bacon, and coffee nearby - Jabb Bush was disturbed by the failure of his campaign to attract more media attention. \"I can drop my pants,\" he said in an interview. \"Get the whole crowd.\" Everyone will be surprised, but the press will never notice.\" On January 10, 2021, in an article on Facebook, he said that Nancy Belusi had sent a letter to the Mayor of Portland after demonstrations there \"requiring him to stick to a proven democratic playbook.\" By the book of Sierra Aurourke on January 11, 2021, it was actually Bush who suggested -- in a joke here -- that Boston Globe's reporter could even pull his pants and the Moon's people and still not get any media attention. It is fair to say that Bush was exaggerating here to make a point about the lack of media coverage. This point was given by Bush to a journalist from a major publication. And that reporter led him in an article three days before the initial election. I've made Trump's comments make it look like Bush is threatening people with the moon, and that's not the case. Bush's quote at the time was repeated in several blogs on the Internet, and it was posted on Facebook by the Dragge report. The Governor Trump said that Bush said he was gonna take his pants off and moon everyone, nobody reported it. Bosch talked about people babbling. On February 6, the Boston Globe reported that Bush said, \"I can drop my pants. Pass the whole crowd. Everyone will be surprised, but the press will never notice.\" The purpose of Bush &apos; s comment on the journalist was to show how he felt he did not get coverage of the campaign. But Trump's statement is misleading, because Bush did not threaten people with the moon, and his suspension was already reported. The statement has an element of truth but ignores the critical context. So we evaluate it mostly wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05410"}
