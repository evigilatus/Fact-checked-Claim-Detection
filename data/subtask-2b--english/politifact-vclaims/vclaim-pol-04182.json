A recent post from Oxfam America, the U.S. branch of the global anti-poverty group, particularly piqued our interest. Oxfam wants the presidential candidates to tackle the issue in their upcoming debate.\n\"The world's 62 richest people own the same wealth as the 3.6 billion poorest. What will you do to combat runaway inequality in the US and around the world?\" Oxfam America asked\u00a0on Twitter.\nIs that so?\nIt turns out Oxfam America isn\u2019t quite right. But the number is in the ballpark.\nOxfam came up with the comparison in January using two different reports. The first, from Credit Suisse, estimated the distribution of household wealth worldwide. The second was Forbes\u2019 list of billionaires.\nWe'll walk you through the calculations and a couple of caveats.\nThe Credit Suisse report\nAnalysts hired by Credit Suisse estimated total personal wealth at $250 trillion. From there, they estimated that the bottom half of the world\u2019s population (approximately 3.6 billion people) owned less than 1 percent of all wealth. To be precise, (and you can find this on page 110 of the full Credit Suisse databook) the bottom half of the world\u2019s population own .59 percent of world household wealth, which comes out to about $1.4 trillion.\nThere are some caveats about the calculation.\nRaul Santaeulalia-Llopis, an economist at Washington University in St. Louis, said that Credit Suisse may have underestimated wealth in low-income countries but not enough to make the numbers much different.\nThe strongest criticism of the Credit Suisse report is that it includes a significant number of people in wealthy countries who are not poor but have large debts. That produces misleading results, experts told us.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBernie Sanders\n\n\nstated on February 7, 2016 in a video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The richest 80 people in the world own more wealth than the bottom half of the global population.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jon Greenberg \u2022 February 17, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"(They) are not actually living in poverty but simply have very low or even negative net worth due to amassment of debt to finance housing, education and consumption beyond current income,\" Brent Beardsley, managing director at the Boston Consulting Group, said. \"In this case, wealth -- or rather net worth -- \u00a0is not an adequate measure of what is commonly understood as poverty.\"\nForbes billionaire estimates\nThe second half of the comparison is relatively straightforward.\nOxfam used Forbes' list of billionaires and counted how many people it would take to reach $1.4 trillion -- the figure representing the wealth of the bottom half of the global population.\nForbes' calculations aren't perfect, but they are the best estimate publicly available. Forbes tracks changes in real time, but the base comparisons depend on estimates generated by members of the Forbes team. Sometimes the billionaires themselves say the numbers are off, because all the necessary information is not public knowledge. Then there are fluctuations due to changing currency exchange rates and the ups and downs of the stock market.\nThe list can\u2019t deliver pinpoint accuracy, but it does represent a good faith effort to assess the net worth of the world\u2019s wealthiest people. Like the wealth calculations in the Credit Suisse report, it should be seen as a reasonable estimate.\nSo what does Forbes say today, about 10 months after Oxfam wrote its report?\nAccording to the publisher, the world\u2019s wealthiest 54 people control $1.4 trillion -- the same amount attributed to the combined wealth of the bottom 50 percent of people living in the world.\nOur ruling\nOxfam America said the world's 62 richest people own the same wealth as the 3.6 billion poorest. The Oxfam analysis was based on a report from Credit Suisse and the Forbes list of billionaires.\nThe exact number of billionaires might well be different from the 62 that Oxfam said. But out of world population of 7.3 billion, it makes little difference if the tally were 100. It still represents a tiny sliver of a percentage of the people in the world.\nThe statement is accurate but needs additional information. We rate it Mostly True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6158005b-55d8-4bf3-84eb-f25bd2df4025", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04182"}
