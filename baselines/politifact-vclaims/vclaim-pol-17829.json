Not Jeffrey Epstein.\u00a0\nUntil his death in 2019, the late financier and registered sex offender accused of sex trafficking minors owned a private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands called Little St. James. But the island doesn\u2019t share an address with SpongeBob SquarePants, the title character of the Nickelodeon animated show.\u00a0\nImages being shared on social media show SpongeBob\u2019s address\u2014124 Conch St, Bikini Bottom\u2014and then what looks like a screenshot of a Google search for \"little st james island theme park.\" The results show \"Ledges of Little St. James,\" which is described as a \"theme park in the United States Virgin Islands,\" and shows an address of \"124 conch street Bikini bottom, St Thomas 00802, U.S. Virgin Islands.\"\n\"Spongebob\u2019s license address is Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s private island!\" the post says.\u00a0\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Rather, we found several fact-checks debunking the claim. But it looks like the listing still existed when the Dispatch Fact Check investigated the images on July 23.\u00a0\n\"The listing has been claimed on Google, but it has not been verified,\" the Dispatch wrote. \"Satellite imagery of the location showed that initially, the \u2018theme park\u2019 is actually what was formerly Epstein\u2019s main compound on the island. As of the publication of this article, a second location has been added with the exact same address and business name, this one for a building on an unnamed road on the island of St. Thomas. The \u2018theme park\u2019 on Little St. James has nine reviews, all from within the last week.\"\nAnyone can add places like businesses or landmarks on Google Maps, subject to verification, and it seems that someone recently added a theme park to the island with a fake address before it was taken down.\u00a0\nSatellite images of the island don\u2019t show a theme park. And searching for something connecting Jeffrey Epstein and this supposed theme park, we found nothing.\nWe rate this Facebook post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17829"}
