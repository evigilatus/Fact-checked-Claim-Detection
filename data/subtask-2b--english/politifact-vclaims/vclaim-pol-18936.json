The shooter ran away, and the deputies were taken to the hospital to treat their injuries.\nThe department has not released the deputies\u2019 names. But users on social media went ahead anyway and connected one of the deputies to another deputy-involved shooting in June, without evidence.\nOn June 18, LA sheriff\u2019s deputy Miguel Vega shot and killed 18-year-old Andrew Guardado after a confrontation at an auto repair business. Deputies and Guardado\u2019s family dispute the details of the shooting and a criminal investigation is underway.\nThe posts on Instagram compare two screenshots: On the left, they say, are photos of a female deputy who some described as smirking at the scene of Guardado\u2019s shooting. On the right is a grainy still from surveillance video of the female deputy who was shot in the patrol vehicle.\nWarning: The following image contains graphic content.\n\n\u00a0\nText above the images reads: \"The same deputy who got shot through her jaw in Saturday\u2019s shooting is the same officer that was seen on video laughing and smirking at the scene of security guard Andres Guardado\u2019s death after he was shot and killed by LASD officers on June 18th, 2020.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"KARMA?\" one Instagram post of the collage reads.\nThe posts were flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

The department has said a 31-year-old woman and a 24-year-old man were shot, and that the two deputies were sworn in about 14 months ago.\nSome media reports have identified the ambushed deputy as a 31-year-old former librarian aide who graduated from LA\u2019s deputy academy in July 2019. (We are choosing not to repeat her name since we have not confirmed it.) This timeline squares with the reported timeline of service for the deputies who were shot.\u00a0\nThe Daily Mail\u00a0spoke with the deputy\u2019s father and published photos from her graduation ceremony. They show she is not the same woman who appears in the Instagram screenshot at the scene of the Guardado shooting.\nWe rate this post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18936"}
