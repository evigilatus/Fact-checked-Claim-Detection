When he headed back to the White House from the hospital, he advised people on Twitter, \"Don\u2019t be afraid of Covid. Don\u2019t let it dominate your life.\"\nHe followed that up with another tweet the next morning.\n\"Many people every year, sometimes over 100,000, and despite the Vaccine, die from the Flu,\" he wrote Oct. 6. \"Are we going to close down our Country? No, we have learned to live with it, just like we are learning to live with Covid, in most populations far less lethal!!!\"\nTwitter has now flagged that tweet for \"sharing misleading and potentially harmful information\" about COVID-19. For the same reason, a similar post from Trump on Facebook was taken down completely.\u00a0\nIn the U.S. so far this year, about 210,000 people have died from COVID-19.\nTrump\u2019s figure for the number of people who have died from seasonal flu is wrong on its face, and distorts the government\u2019s actual estimates.\nFor the worst season this decade \u2014 2017-18 \u2014 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention put the death toll at 61,000. Taking into account uncertainties in reporting flu deaths, the CDC offered a range of 46,000 to 95,000 deaths.\nBut the more typical range is significantly lower.\n\nThe average number of deaths per year over the past decade has been 35,900. And even taking the high-end of the range for each year, the average is 51,800. That\u2019s half Trump\u2019s number.\nInfectious disease researcher Marm Kilpatrick at University of California Santa Cruz said one has to go back to 1968 to find a seasonal death toll of 100,000 \u2014 and that was when a brand new strain emerged.\nTrump also said that for \"most populations,\" COVID-19 is less deadly than the flu.\nThat\u2019s also wrong, but it reflects that the patterns for the two diseases are different.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPat Toomey\n\n\nstated on January 19, 2021 in a hearing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere will be several thousand dollars in payments going to families with six-figure incomes who\u2019ve had no income interruption whatsoever.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jessica Calefati \u2022 January 21, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CDC reports that flu is most deadly for children and the elderly. The CDC said that \"the risk of complications for healthy children is higher for flu compared to COVID-19.\"\nBroadly, for people of all ages who show flu symptoms, the CDC data shows a death rate of about 0.1%. Given that the CDC says only about half of all flu infections lead to symptoms, the actual infection fatality rate could be in the range of 0.05%.\nData on COVID-19 remains a moving target, and current estimates should be seen in that light.\nUsing the CDC\u2019s age-specific data on COVID-19, and the U.S. age distribution, Kilpatrick estimated the infection death rate for COVID-19 is about 0.7%. That\u2019s in the ballpark of other estimates, and would make the coronavirus more than 10 times more deadly than the flu.\nDrilling into the details for different age groups, Kilpatrick cautioned that the data is still emerging. But he said the best comparison he\u2019s found of the death rates among age groups for COVID-19 and the seasonal flu comes from independent researcher Marc Bevand.\nBevand drew on 13 studies of COVID-19 and the CDC\u2019s influenza data. In every age group over the age of 30, COVID-19 was more deadly than the flu.\nFor people in their 30s, COVID-19 was 2.9 times more deadly. For those in their 70s, it was 14.4 times deadlier.\nThe CDC doesn\u2019t provide an apples-to-apples comparison of flu and COVID-19 deaths by age. It currently estimates that the COVID-19 death rate ranges from .003% for children and teens to 5.4% for people 70 and up.\u00a0\n\nWe reached out to the White House and the Trump campaign and did not hear back.\nOur ruling\nTrump said that more than 100,000 people die from the flu and \"in most populations, COVID-19 is far less lethal.\"\nIn the past decade, the average yearly death toll from the flu has been 35,900. About 50 years ago, 100,000 people died one year, but that was an anomaly.\nOverall, the data show that COVID-19 is more deadly than the flu. By one estimate, it is 10 times more deadly.\nComparing death rates for age groups is more challenging, but the data shows that for everyone over 30, COVID-19 is deadlier than the flu.\nWe rate this claim False.\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections FactChat #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click\u00a0here, for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18618"}
