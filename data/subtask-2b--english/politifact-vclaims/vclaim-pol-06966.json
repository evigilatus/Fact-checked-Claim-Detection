It very likely may have, we discovered, but it\u2019s too early to know for sure.\nWeak track record\nIn recent years, the percentage of Texans turning out to vote in statewide elections was among the lowest in the country.\nAccording to a 2013 Texas Civic Health Index report by the Annette Strauss Institute for Civic Life at the University of Texas, Texas ranked last in voter turnout in the 2010 election. Citing U.S. Census Bureau information based on voter surveys every even-numbered year, the report said Texas ranked 48th in turnout in 2012, 47th in 2008 and 49th in 2006. The 2014 survey results are yet to be reported.\nIt\u2019s not just Texas that\u2019s experienced low voter turnout. According to a Nov. 11, 2014, editorial in the New York Times, the November 2014 election saw the smallest share of eligible-to-vote Americans turn out to vote--36.3 percent--since the mid-term election year of 1942.\nStanford\u2019s backup\nStanford, asked where his numbers came from, directed us to a Nov. 6, 2014, news blog post by the Dallas Observer, an alternative news weekly. Its story, titled \"Texas Had the Worst Voter Turnout in the Country, and the Rain in Dallas Didn\u2019t Help,\" posted data from the Florida-based United States Elections Project, a one-man operation from University of Florida political scientist Michael McDonald that\u2019s reported voter turnout by state since 2000.\nAccording to the Elections Project, Texas sustained the nation\u2019s second-lowest turnout rate of 28.5 percent, trailing only Indiana, which landed at 28 percent.\nIn contrast, numbers from the Texas Secretary of State suggest nearly 34 percent turnout in Texas.\nWhat explains the difference?\nMcDonald\u2019s project looks at the share of voters eligible to vote, registered or not, as its base, while the state presents the share of registered voters (a smaller group) as its base.\nBy phone, McDonald said many states base announced turnout percentages on the registered voter population because that number is easily accessible and doesn\u2019t require calculations based on estimates by the Census Bureau.\nOn the Elections Project website, McDonald calls turnout rates for registered voters alone \"uninformative for comparison purposes\" because voter registration practices vary across states (North Dakota, for instance, requires no voter registration). Also, McDonald writes, voter registration rolls include double entries because the records don\u2019t always catch up to voters changing residences and they often list voters who have left the state.\nMany Americans could vote but don\u2019t bother to register. Al Jazeera America reported on Nov. 5, 2014, that 70 million Americans who qualified to vote did not register for the 2014 election and, hence, were excluded from voter turnout calculations based on the share of registered voters who cast ballots.\nFor his analysis of each state, McDonald said, he reached his turnout estimates by considering the number of votes cast in the statewide race generating the highest participation -- which in Texas was the governor\u2019s race (also the race used by the Texas Secretary of State to calculate turnout, office spokeswoman Alicia Pierce told us by phone).\nBy phone, Observer reporter Stephen Young told us he declared Texas\u2019 voter turnout the nation\u2019s lowest for the year because that appears to hold for the 36 states that had gubernatorial elections, which he said draw more voters in non-presidential election years than balloting in states lacking those marquee races. Indiana (the state with lower turnout than Texas) was among the 14 states lacking a vote for governor.\nCalculating voter turnout\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur research showed there is no universally agreed-upon method of calculating voter turnout. Some groups use a state\u2019s voting-age population to determine turnout; others, like the Elections Project and the Census Bureau, start from adults eligible to vote by estimating and subtracting adults legally ineligible to vote including felons and non-citizens. Others, like many state governments, calculate the portion of registered voters who voted in a given race.\nIn a 2012 survey, the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, an independent clearinghouse of elections information, asked each state to report its voting statistics. The EAC compiled the responses and ranked Texas 47th in turnout among voting-age citizens (ahead of West Virginia, Hawaii, New Mexico and Mississippi).\nA wrinkle to consider when talking turnout is that voters participate in voting for some offices more than others. Of Texas\u2019 14,025,441 registered voters as of November 2014, about 4.7 million voters participated in the gubernatorial election while about 4.6 million made a choice in the race for U.S. senator (even though it topped the ballot); down the ballot, a little more than 3.7 million votes were cast for one of the Texas Supreme Court seats, according to unofficial results.\nHistorically, the Texas Secretary of State reports the turnout of registered voters and turnout of the voting-age population, though the state has yet to calculate the latter figure for the 2014 elections.\nThe Strauss Institute report was based on census bureau data gathered by a phone survey in which residents were asked questions to determine if they were eligible to vote, then were asked if they\u2019d voted. The report said: \"While other ways of measuring voting rates are available, each calculates the \u2018eligible\u2019 population\u2014the denominator in the fraction\u2014differently.\"\nWe asked McDonald precisely how he whittles Census Bureau population estimates down to the estimated number of adults eligible to vote in each state and then how he quickly establishes turnout percentages.\nBy phone, McDonald said:\n-He begins with the voting-age population and subtracts population estimates for demographics that are ineligible to vote, like felons and non-citizens.\n-He calculates each state\u2019s number of eligible voters in the months before an election, then uses vote counts reported by the Associated Press after election night and historical data from past elections to call voter turnout before all votes are counted.\n-He cautions that no turnout numbers will be official until states report total ballots cast to the Election Assistance Commission--probably by late 2015--so for now, the Texas numbers are an estimate.\nIndependent confirmation\nWe sought to compare the Elections Project estimates of voter turnout with other analyses, nearly coming up empty. Officials with groups we queried--the Pew Research Center, the Voter Participation Project, the Election Assistance Commission and the Texas Tribune--said they relied on the project\u2019s figures.\nBy phone, Curtis Gans, who has led the Center for the Study of the American Electorate at American University in Washington, D.C, since at least 1976, told us preliminary data collected by the center for 2014 didn\u2019t conclusively show Texas, which hasn\u2019t yet finished counting ballots, would have the nation\u2019s worst voter turnout.\n\"Texas has been near the bottom for many years, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s at the bottom this year,\" Gans said. \"In any case, it will be near the bottom.\" He said the center would release its voter turnout data within weeks.\nHe said other states with historically low turnout, like New York and California, also haven\u2019t finished counting ballots. As of Nov. 7, 2014, three days after the elections, the Elections Project said, 31.8 percent of California\u2019s 24,408,163 eligible-to-vote citizens had turned out for the 2014 election, while 28.8 percent of New York\u2019s 13,563,172 had voted.\nOur ruling \nStanford said that in November 2014, \"Texas had the worst voter participation in the country.\"\nAccording to the respected Elections Project, Texas appears to have had the lowest voter participation among states with a governor\u2019s race. Among all states, though, Indiana appears to have had lower turnout--and besides, voting statistics aren\u2019t final.\nWe rate Stanford\u2019s statement Mostly True.\n\nMOSTLY TRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06966"}
