Bobby Franklin has made a hobby out of triggering liberal ire. And yes, he\u2019s done it again.\n\nThe Marietta legislator\u2019s House Bill 1 rejects the authority of landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling Roe v. Wade. It bans abortion and labels it \"prenatal murder,\" a crime punishable by life in prison or death.\n\nBut that\u2019s not what had bloggers at left-leaning publications seething. It\u2019s that they think the bill could allow prosecutors to charge mothers who miscarry with a crime.\n\nJen Phillips, a staffer with liberal magazine Mother Jones, wrote the bill \"showed an astonishing lack of concern for women\u2019s health and well-being.\"\n\n\"Under Rep. Franklin\u2019s bill, HB 1, women who miscarry could become felons if they cannot prove that there was \u2018no human involvement whatsoever in the causation\u2019 of their miscarriage,\" she wrote.\n\nWomen who miscarry could be charged as felons? Is that true?\n\nFranklin has sponsored similar anti-abortion bills without success. This one doesn\u2019t have much steam behind it, either. But given how this claim took off in the blogosphere, we thought it was worth a look.\n\nWe called Phillips, who pointed us to a portion of the bill that defines \"prenatal murder.\"\n\n\"Such a term does not include a naturally occurring expulsion of a fetus known medically as a \u2018spontaneous abortion\u2019 and popularly as a \u2018miscarriage\u2019 so long as there is no human involvement whatsoever in the causation of such event,\" the bill states.\n\nThe problem is the phrase \"no human involvement\" is so broad and the causes of miscarriage can be so complex and difficult to understand that any woman whose actions can be viewed as playing a role in her miscarriage could be prosecuted, Phillips argued. \u00a0\n\nThis could be a problem. Other critics we interviewed said that under this language, a woman who miscarried could be prosecuted for choosing cancer treatment, taking illegal drugs, or falling off a bicycle while pregnant. All of those situations require some \"human involvement.\"\n\nFranklin said these objections have absolutely no merit.\n\n\"[T]hose criticisms are mere smoke screens since as you know the bill does not specifically call for \u2026 those things,\" Franklin wrote in an e-mail. \u00a0\n\nAbortion rights advocates agreed that Franklin\u2019s legislation could criminalize miscarriage. A spokeswoman for anti-abortion group Georgia Right to Life said they have not analyzed the bill.\n\nFranklin is right that the bill does not specify that women can be prosecuted under the scenarios that critics raised. However, laws can have unexpected consequences. We therefore took a closer look at Georgia law.\n\nAn existing state statute on \"feticide,\" or the destruction of a fetus in the uterus, generally bars women from being prosecuted in the death of her fetus. Frankin\u2019s bill does not repeal this law.\n\nBut there\u2019s an exception under Georgia\u2019s \"feticide by vehicle\" statute. In a 2010 Douglasville case, a pregnant driver fled from police, leading them on a chase.\n\nThe driver crashed. Her baby was delivered by emergency C-section but did not survive.\n\nProsecutors charged the pregnant driver. While Georgia\u2019s \"feticide by vehicle\" statute does not mandate mothers be charged when they cause crashes leading to the death of their own fetuses, it does not prohibit it.\n\nResearch shows that nationally, women have been prosecuted for conduct affecting their fetuses, even when the law does not expressly provide for it, said Lynn Paltrow, executive director of National Advocates for Pregnant Women, which fights anti-abortion laws.\n\nPaltrow gave us examples, which we confirmed.\n\nFor instance, in a 2008 South Carolina case, a woman faced homicide charges after attempting suicide while eight months pregnant, killing the fetus. A 1997 state Supreme Court ruling decided that a fetus is considered a child if it is viable, or able to live outside the uterus. This means pregnant women can be prosecuted under state child abuse statutes.\n\nIn Missouri, the law bars prosecuting a woman for \"indirectly harming her unborn child by failing to properly care for herself or by failing to follow any particular program of prenatal care,\" but mothers have been charged with child abuse and convicted of involuntary manslaughter for substance abuse while pregnant, news accounts show. \u00a0\n\nSince HB 1 does not repeal existing Georgia feticide law, it\u2019s possible to argue its passage might not lead to the prosecution of women in the death of their fetuses. A judge might decide the earlier feticide law prevents it. However, such a ruling is no sure thing.\n\nIn conclusion:\n\nCritics of Franklin\u2019s bill say that the \"human involvement\" language is so vague that women could be prosecuted for miscarriages, and we agree with them.\n\nWhile the law does not explicitly allow for miscarriage prosecutions, and Franklin said this is not his intent, the language is so broad it does open the door for women to face felony charges if they abuse drugs, fall off a bicycle, fail to wear a seat belt, or opt for cancer treatment while pregnant.\n\nWomen in Georgia and across the nation have previously been prosecuted for actions investigators think adversely affected their fetuses, even if the law does not specifically call for them to do so. \u00a0\n\nHowever, women who miscarry might not be handled as felons. It depends on how prosecutors and judges decide to handle the law.\n\nThe statement could use a little more context. We therefore rule Phillips\u2019 statement Mostly True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMelanie Crozier\n\n\nstated on July 21, 2010 in a Politico article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKaren Handel \"would have felt like it was OK to go in and abort\" Sarah Palin's son Trig, who has Down syndrome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Willoughby Mariano \u2022 July 26, 2010", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13507"}
