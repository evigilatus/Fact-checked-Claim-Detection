Bob Donovan harbors no illusions of a cakewalk to the mayor\u2019s office in 2016.\nThe well-funded and entrenched incumbent, Tom Barrett, appears poised to seek a fourth four-year term.\nAnd history\u2019s not on Donovan\u2019s side, the alderman told supporters July 29, 2014, when he announced his bid.\n\"What we are proposing is monumental and also unprecedented,\" Donovan said. \"As a matter of fact to the best of my knowledge there has never been an alderman who has defeated an incumbent mayor in the history of this great city.\"\nMilwaukee\u2019s modern-day tendency to return incumbents to office is well documented: it\u2019s been almost 75 years since a mayor fell (Carl Zeidler stunned Daniel Hoan in 1940).\nBut never\u2019s a long time. No alderman has ever dethroned a mayor?\nTo the history books\nWe took up Donovan\u2019s history challenge, looking back to the early days of city government, when aldermen received no salary and worked out of a church and above a livery stable.\nMilwaukee has elected a \"boy mayor\" (flashy 29-year-old Sherburn Becker, 1906). It has backed \u00a0mayors born in Germany, Ireland and France. It voted in a mayor (Zeidler) whose surprising win was engineered by the future writer of \"Psycho.\"\nThe city\u2019s voters have made a mayor of the man who wrote the \"Peck\u2019s Bad Boy\" books (George W. Peck), and have tapped surgeons, liquor peddlers, judges, congressman, bankers and many lawyers to the post. Democrats are the rule, but a few Republicans have broken through.\nBut relatively few aldermen even have run against an incumbent.\nThe last to try, unsuccessfully, was Rod Lanser in the 1968 primary. Mayor Henry Maier won a third term and served until 1988.\nThe last to win a mayor\u2019s race as an alderman: Emil Seidel (1910), owner of a small pattern shop.\nSeidel is remembered not for that, but for starting the city\u2019s half-century of mainly Socialist Party mayors. He made a national splash, becoming the first Socialist to run a major U.S. city.\nBut Seidel didn\u2019t defeat a sitting mayor.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin LeMahieu\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a TV interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It takes quite a while on Election Day to load those ballots, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee.\"\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe tried, but in 1908 lost narrowly to David S. Rose, described by historian John Gurda as \"a political prince of darkness who allowed prostitution, gambling dens, all-night saloons and influence-peddling to flourish on his watch\" while fighting off criminal charges.\nRose wasn\u2019t re-nominated by the Democrats in 1910, and Seidel defeated Republican physician John Beffel (\"Dr. Good Government\").\nLike Donovan, Seidel was fond of meeting constituents in taverns. so much so that \"Seidel\" became a nickname for a beer mug, Martin Hintz recounts in \"A Spirited History of Milwaukee Brews & Booze.\"\nBack to Donovan\u2019s claim that since the city charter was signed in 1846, no alderman has defeated a sitting mayor.\nEchoing Donovan, to the best of our knowledge, he is correct.\nWe examined newspaper archives and the Milwaukee Public Library\u2019s \"Milwaukee Mayors\" digital collection. We consulted with the city\u2019s Legislative Reference Bureau\u2019s library manager, Eileen Lipinski, Gurda and Milwaukee City Clerk Jim Owczarski. \u00a0We reviewed races up to the present day.\nOnly a handful of aldermen or former aldermen have advanced to the mayor\u2019s office, and none against an incumbent, Lipinski found after combing through records kept by the non-partisan research agency.\nA tough challenge\nWhat makes the leap from alderman to mayor so tough? After all, there\u2019s only a couple hundred feet separating their second-floor offices in Milwaukee\u2019s 119-year-old City Hall downtown.\n\"Most alderman are very familiar to voters in their districts,\" offered Donovan. \"But not citywide.\"\nThere\u2019s also a general fear among alderman about taking on any sitting mayor, for fear of losing and suffering retribution in terms of help for their districts, Donovan said.\n\"I\u2019m not accusing the mayor,\" said Donovan, who intends to run for both mayor and his district seat simultaneously. \"That\u2019s always a concern of aldermen. We\u2019re only as good as what we can deliver.\"\nDonovan might not find as much comfort from Seidel\u2019s example if he digs into the deep background on the Socialist.\nSeidel, we found, was elected in 1908 as an \"alderman at large,\" which meant he had a citywide constituency, rather than representing a smaller geographical area.\nOur rating\nNo Milwaukee alderman has defeated an incumbent to become mayor, according to Donovan.\nIt\u2019s relatively rare for aldermen or former aldermen to run for mayor. It\u2019s even more rare for them to win. And none has ever bested a sitting mayor, experts agree.\nWe rate Donovan\u2019s statement True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07486"}
