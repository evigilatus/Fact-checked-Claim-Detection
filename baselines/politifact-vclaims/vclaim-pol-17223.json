Someone\u2019s going to get killed. And it\u2019s not right.\"\nOne worker who has faced threats is the subject of a Facebook post about a contractor for Dominion Voting Systems, which makes software and hardware used by elections workers in multiple states:\nThe post says that the Dominion representative at a Gwinnett County elections office downloaded data to a USB flash drive from the election management server and plugged it into a laptop to \"manipulate the data.\"\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Although it\u2019s not possible to tell what the representative is doing as he works on computers, the narrators leap to conclusions and portray his actions as nefarious.\n\"He just pulled a USB out,\" says the male narrator.\n\"Did he? Where is he going?...,\" says the female narrator. \"Oh my god \u2014 is he taking it to that laptop?\"\nThe narrators then continue to chuckle and speculate about the man\u2019s actions, but without any evidence that he is doing anything wrong.\nGwinnett County spokesperson Joe Sorenson told us that the video shows \"a Dominion technician producing a data report on the server and saving the report to a Dominion USB thumb drive and then using a laptop to filter requested information. The Dominion servers are not equipped with Excel and counties are not authorized to install any hardware or software on these systems.\"\nA Dominion spokesperson told Fox News\u2019 Eric Shawn in a Nov. 22 interview that it wouldn\u2019t be possible for a person to stick a thumb drive into a computer and fill it up with thousands of votes for Joe Biden. The interview was related to baseless claims made by pro-Trump lawyer Sidney Powell and occurred before the viral Facebook video appeared.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDominion election equipment has been a frequent subject of misinformation promoted by Trump\u2019s allies and social media users following Trump\u2019s narrow loss in Georgia.\nA Dominion representative didn\u2019t respond to our questions about the video but referred us to the public remarks Sterling made debunking the misinformation.\n\"A 20-something tech in Gwinnett County today has death threats and a noose put out, saying he should be hung for treason because he was transferring a report on batches from an (election management system) to a county computer so we could read it,\" Sterling told reporters.\nSterling said that the allegation that the worker was manipulating election data from the recount was \"wrong.\"\nHe called on Trump and Georgia\u2019s Republican senators \u2014 Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, who are both campaigning for runoff elections against Democrats on Jan. 5 \u2014 to condemn violent rhetoric.\u00a0\n\"This has to stop.
