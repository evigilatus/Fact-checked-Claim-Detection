That\u2019s a tremendous burden on our health care system. And we are facing a public health care crisis in this country related to sugar consumption.\"\n\nAs public fury has raged over the penny-an-ounce tax, Preckwinkle has scrupulously avoided discussing the issue on either its health or fiscal aspects alone.\n\nEnter Michael Bloomberg. The billionaire former New York mayor and unabashed supporter of measures to limit sweetened drink consumption has become a major defender of the Cook County tax and the county officials who voted for it. He\u2019s spent more than $5 million on ads touting the health benefits of the tax and funded a website, cookcountyhealthykids.org, that makes a claim county officials have avoided.\n\u00a0\n\n\"The soda tax can make a difference by reducing consumption of unhealthy soda pop and sugary beverages that contribute to diabetes, obesity, heart disease and other serious medical conditions,\" the site says.\nDoes adding a penny per ounce to the cost of sweetened drinks cause a decrease in their consumption? As debate rages over the soda tax, we decided to check.\nScarce research\nWhen Cook County began collecting its tax on Aug. 2, it became only the sixth jurisdiction in the United States to collect an excise tax on sweetened drinks and only the second to include artificially sweetened drinks. Two more cities, San Francisco and Seattle, have soda taxes scheduled to begin Jan. 1, 2018. The first excise tax on sugar-sweetened soft drinks went into effect in Berkeley, Calif., on March 1, 2015.\nGovernments have long levied so-called \"sin taxes\" on certain commodities, products and activities, ostensibly to offset their social costs while also raking in new revenue. Taxes on sweetened drinks are the latest effort by health advocates like Bloomberg to bring them into the \"sin tax\" category for their role in America\u2019s obesity problem. But soft drink consumption is deeply entrenched in American culture, and the soft drink industry and many consumers have yet to accept the \"sin\" label for this tax.\n\nGiven the recent nature of soda taxes, there\u2019s not a deep reservoir of academic research on their effects. And we should note here that the soft drink industry rejects the basic premise of Bloomberg\u2019s statement -- that any reduction in an individual\u2019s soft drink consumption is a step toward better health.\nA study published in April by the Oakland Calif.-based Public Health Institute and the University of North Carolina found that sales of taxed beverages dropped 9.6 percent in the first year while sales of untaxed drinks rose 3.5 percent. But the researchers noted that Berkeley is not a typical test market because it consumed only 34 percent of the national average for sugar-sweetened beverages.\n\"Population-based findings on (sugar-sweetened beverage) consumption were not definitive, and consumption should be further evaluated in more typical communities and with larger samples,\" the authors wrote.\nA study published in September 2016 in the American Journal of Public Health found that sugar-sweetened drink consumption in Berkeley decreased by 21 percent. That study was limited to low-income neighborhoods.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Public Health Institute study, like studies planned for Cook County and Oakland, Calif., was funded in part by Michael Bloomberg\u2019s Bloomberg Philanthropies. This gets into what has been a thorny issue in the broader debate over the health implications of sweetened drinks, in which researchers have found that studies funded by the soda industry consistently find minimal adverse effects from sweetened drink consumption while independent studies consistently find the opposite. Bloomberg\u2019s involvement in this early research may invite criticism from opponents of the taxes.\nMexico, which instituted a 10 percent tax on soda in 2014, saw soda purchases decline steadily through the year, according to a study in the British Medical Journal. Sales declined by 6 percent early in the year and continued to decline to 12 percent by year\u2019s end. That study also was funded partly by Bloomberg.\nA study published in November 2016 in the journal PLOS Medicine used the Mexican sales declines recorded in the British study and projected reduced soda consumption due to the tax \"will likely prevent approximately 189,300 new cases of type 2 diabetes, 20,400 incident strokes and heart attacks, and 18,900 deaths over 10 years among adults 35\u201394 years of age.\"\nResearchers used the Cardiovascular Disease Policy Model, which has been used since the 1980s to estimate health benefits in the U.S., to create the report\u2019s 10-year projection.\nIn another modeling study, Harvard researchers projected that a penny-per-ounce nationwide tax on sugar-sweetened drinks in the U.S. \"could substantially reduce (obesity) and healthcare expenditures and increase healthy life expectancy.\"\nCloser to home\nLess than two months into the Cook County tax, evidence of its effect on sweetened drink consumption is largely anecdotal but appears to support Bloomberg\u2019s claim.\n\"We have received reports from retailers in Cook County of lost sales between mid-40 percent near the border and teens near city center. Likewise, there are reports of significant increases in sales in collar counties that are very close to matching,\" Rob Karr, president of the Illinois Retail Merchants Association said in an email. \"It is VERY difficult to get retailers to openly share such information as it is highly proprietary. They are scared to death of conclusions that competitors or others may draw with such data given the extraordinarily competitive nature and extremely narrow margins in grocery.\"\nCan the Tax, a group that opposes the tax, said in August that the tax had an immediate effect on sales, especially at stores near the Cook County border.\n\nSales data during the beverage tax\u2019s first weekend provided by three retailers for 21 total Cook County stores is alarming. Every store reported a decline in sales of at least 6 percent and as much as 39 percent,\" said an Aug. 17 press release. \"Further, declines in beverage sales for stores near the Cook County border were among the highest reported amid concerns of mass consumer flight to Indiana and the collar counties as residents try to avoid paying the tax.\"\nFor retailers, the decline is bad news. For supporters like Bloomberg, it\u2019s a credible signal of less consumption. Unknown, however, is to what extent sales lost in Cook County are replaced by purchases in either the collar counties or in Indiana.\nThe Philadelphia story\nIf there\u2019s a case study for Cook County\u2019s sweetened drink tax, it might be Philadelphia.\nThe city council there approved a 1.5-cent-per-ounce sweetened drink tax that went into effect on Jan. 1, 2017, with proceeds earmarked for pre-K education, parks and libraries. In its first six months, the tax generated $39.3 million -- short of both the original $42.6 million projection and a revised estimate of $39.7 million.\nA study there in August by the Florida marketing firm Catalina said sales had dropped 55 percent since the tax, while sales of carbonated soft drinks outside city limits had increased 38 percent. But city officials say the study is flawed because it looked only at retail sales, which account for less than half of total sales, and because the tax could not have generated $39.3 million if all sales had dropped 55 percent.\nOur ruling\nBloomberg said Cook County\u2019s sweetened beverage tax can bring health benefits by \"reducing consumption of unhealthy soda pop and sugary beverages.\"\nCook County is only the sixth jurisdiction in the U.S. to enact a sweetened drink tax since Berkeley, Calif., enacted the first one in March 2015. That means there\u2019s been very little formal research on their effects, which makes proving or disproving Bloomberg\u2019s claim difficult.\nAcademic research in Berkeley and on Mexico\u2019s soda tax has shown declines in sales, however. Anecdotal evidence from tax opponents in Illinois appears to show the same here, as does a recent marketing report in Philadelphia. Studies using modeling schemes to project health outcomes based on reduced consumption also tilt in Bloomberg\u2019s favor.\nCook County\u2019s soda tax may not survive long enough to become part of the extended field study needed to judge the health effects of similar efforts nationwide. But there\u2019s enough evidence out there to rate Bloomberg\u2019s statement Mostly True.\n Share the Facts 2017-10-02 19:27:20 UTC   PolitiFact    5 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly True  \"The soda tax can make a difference by reducing consumption of unhealthy soda pop and sugary beverages.\"    Michael Bloomberg Former New York mayor https://www.cookcountyhealthykids.org/   Chicago Monday, September 18, 2017 2017-09-18    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02847"}
