A Texas state representative suggested that Sanders must somehow then be aligned with the Nazis of Adolf Hitler.\nState Rep. Jason Villalba, R-Dallas, posted a tweet during the CNN-hosted Democratic presidential debate Oct. 13, 2015, that opened: \"The modern Democrat Party is filled with Democratic Socialists and soft socialists. Is this where we are in America?\"\nTo that tweet, Villalba attached an image of what looked like an old document stating: \"That awkward moment when \u2026 1) Bernie Sanders admits he is a Democratic Socialist. 2) Nazis were Democratic Socialists 3) America fought an entire World War to stop the advance of Democratic Socialists.\" The image closed: \"Sincerely, Sane Americans.\"\nA Democratic activist, Ed Espinoza of Progress Texas, brought it to our attention for a fact check.\nWe didn\u2019t hear back from Villalba about the presented \"Democratic Socialist\" conclusions. But he told the Dallas Morning News and Jonathan Tilove, chief political writer for the Austin American-Statesman, that the image with its mentions of Sanders and the Nazis was a meme he found online.\nHe also insisted his tweet wasn\u2019t likening Democrats to Nazis. \"So is the history accurate in this?\" Villalba told Tilove by phone. \"Of course not. Look, was I trying to make a connection between Sanders and the Nazi party? Absolutely not. I categorically reject any suggestion that that \u00a0is what I was intending to do.\"\nBy the next day, Villalba's tweet was no longer posted by him. Regardless, we checked its accuracy.\nSanders a democratic socialist\nSanders, the independent Vermont senator running for the Democratic presidential nomination, considers himself a democratic socialist. He\u2019s also Jewish.\nIn the debate, moderator Anderson Cooper delved in:\nCOOPER: \"You call yourself a democratic socialist. How can any kind of socialist win a general election in the United States?\"\nSANDERS: \"Well, we're going to win because first, we're going to explain what democratic socialism is. And what democratic socialism is about is saying that it is immoral and wrong that the top one-tenth of 1 percent in this country own almost 90 percent - almost - own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. That it is wrong, today, in a rigged economy, that 57 percent of all new income is going to the top 1 percent.\n\"That when you look around the world, you see every other major country providing healthcare to all people as a right, except the United States. You see every other major country saying to moms that, when you have a baby, we're not going to separate you from your newborn baby, because we are going to have - we are going to have medical and family paid leave, like every other country on Earth.\n\"Those are some of the principles that I believe in and I think we should look to countries like Denmark, like Sweden and Norway, and learn from what they have accomplished for their working people\u2026\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 22, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden \u201chas issued more executive fiats than anyone in such a short period of time, ever, more than Obama, more than Trump, more than anyone.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOOPER: \u2026\"You don't consider yourself a capitalist, though?\"\nSANDERS: \"Do I consider myself part of the casino capitalist process by which so few have so much and so many have so little by which Wall Street's greed and recklessness wrecked this economy? No, I don't. I believe in a society where all people do well. Not just a handful of billionaires.\"\nNazis\nAnd were the Nazis also Democratic Socialists?\nWe consulted historians and books, finding the Nazi party\u2019s full name was the National Socialist German Workers\u2019 Party. That name was adopted in 1920; before that, the party had been the German Workers\u2019 Party.\nBut there was little socialist about the party\u2019s platform or Hitler\u2019s actions once he acceded to leading Germany in the early 1930s.\nBy phone and email, Rice University historian Peter Caldwell told us the key word in the party\u2019s name was \"national\" and the party\u2019s focus was on building nationalism \u2014 a focus ultimately reflected in Hitler\u2019s twisted vision of cleansing the country of residents, especially Jews, not considered of pure German blood. While socialists on the left celebrate democracy, Caldwell said, the word has a different meaning on the right \u2014 in this instance, he said, excluding people who are not part of the nation, hence rejecting Jews and communists and, in pre-World War II Germany, democracy itself.\nCaldwell said the \"misleading\" tweet suggesting an alignment between Sanders\u2019 professed democratic socialism and Hitler\u2019s party would \"have Hitler turning in his grave, wherever the grave is. The Nazis loudly opposed democracy, the first and foremost thing.\" Also, he said, \"they were opposed to emancipating the workers, giving them the rights to vote and to organize\" in unions.\nSimilarly, Barbara Miller Lane, a Bryn Mawr College professor and co-editor of a compilation of Nazi ideology before 1933, said by email: \"The Nazis were NOT \u2018democratic socialists,\u2019 whatever that means. The Nazis were never democrats and never real socialists either.\" While there was a longstanding and distinguished Social Democratic Party in Germany from the 1870 to the 1920s, Lane wrote, the Nazis fought against it, and after 1933 imprisoned its leaders.\nLane added: \"The Nazis opposed all traditional socialism, wanting to substitute something they called \u2018German socialism\u2019 or \u2018Aryan socialism.\u2019 This meant citizenship and privileges only for \u2018Aryans\u2019 (meaning non-Jews), concentration camps for others.\"\nAccording to the \"The Cambridge Illustrated History of Germany,\" Hitler joined the German Workers\u2019 Party in 1919, the year before the party\u2019s decision to add National and Socialist to its name.\nAt the time, according to the book, supporters included \"well-placed anti-Semites and extreme nationalists\" who hoped to gain influence over members of the working class; Hitler, a spellbinding orator, became the party\u2019s chairman in 1921. Another book, \"A Brief History of Germany,\" says the Nazi\u2019s \"appealed to a broad swath of the German population, attracting fervent nationalists and radical conservatives, as well as those who hated the Versailles settlement, feared the communists, or despised the Jews.\"\nOur ruling\nVillalba said Sanders \"admits he is a democratic socialist\u2026 Nazis were Democratic Socialists.\"\nSanders calls himself a democratic socialist. The Nazis were not democratic socialists. Whether or not Villalba intended to link Sanders to the Nazis, his tweet neatly did the job.\nWe find this claim historically inaccurate and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!\n\nPANTS ON FIRE \u2013 The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05849"}
