Most of the presidents studied -- nine, starting with Coolidge and ending with George W. Bush -- oversaw inmate increases on their watch.\nWe wondered whether Schumer was cherry-picking data from the much smaller pool of federal inmates. In 2015, the number of inmates in state-run prisons was almost seven times larger than the number of federal inmates, and the total number of inmates in state and local facilities was more than than 10 times larger than the number in federal custody.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in remarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, we found that the same trends held for state and local inmate populations -- the number declined under Obama for the first time since at least the Carter years.\nHere are the trend lines for state inmates (dark blue) and local inmates (lighter blue), which we compiled from federal prison statistics:\n\nMeanwhile, a credible argument can be made that Obama\u2019s policies made a difference in driving the decline.\nAs we\u2019ve reported, Obama signed the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 into law. It dramatically reduced a 100-to-1 sentencing disparity between powder and crack cocaine. And his administration advocated for, and the U.S. Sentencing Commission approved, the retroactive application of some of the new sentencing guidelines.\nIronically, Sessions was among a number of Senate Republicans who spoke in favor of the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010. \"I will not favor alterations that massively undercut the sentencing we have in place, but I definitely believe that the current system is not fair and that we are not able to defend the sentences that are required to be imposed under the law today,\" he said in a 2009 Senate speech about the bill.\nJames Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University, said he sees no significant omissions from Schumer\u2019s statement. \"The assertion is correct,\" Fox said. \"The reasons are partly strategic and partly being in the right office at the right time.\n\"During Obama's administration, prosecutors were discouraged from seeking unnecessarily long prison sentences for non-violent drug offenders, a practice that the Trump administration wants to change. In addition, the cumulative impact of a declining crime rate had an impact on prison populations.\"\nOur ruling\nSchumer said, \"President Obama became the first president since Carter to leave the White House with a smaller federal prison population than when he took office.\"\nThe statistics bear out Schumer\u2019s assertion, so we rate it True.\n Share the Facts 2017-05-18 21:30:43 UTC   PolitiFact    1 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: True  \"President Obama became the first president since Carter to leave the White House with a smaller federal prison population than when he took office.\"    Charles Schumer Senate Minority Leader   a Senate floor speech Thursday, May 18, 2017 2017-05-18    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03290"}
