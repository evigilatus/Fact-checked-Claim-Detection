In this way, the people will not see those rights and freedoms being removed until past the point at which these changes cannot be reversed. -Adolf Hitler, Mein Kampf\"\nThe caption alongside the post says, \"Stop being unreasonable, no one is here to take your guns \u2026 but we will take those bullets. Don't worry, we're the government and we're here to help. It's for your own good \u2026 An avalanche starts with one little snowflake.\"\nThe post has been shared over 2,600 times since March 21 and was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Miller\u2019s book uses the quote as a header at the start of a chapter and also falsely cites it as coming from Hitler\u2019s \"Mein Kampf\".\nWe reached out to Miller about the quote but did not receive a response.\nBesides there being no evidence that Hitler said or wrote these words, in \"Mein Kampf\" or otherwise, it also represents the opposite of his actions.\nInstead of small changes that slowly eroded the rights of the German people, Hitler made large changes over a short period. Within a month of rising to power in January 1933 as Germany\u2019s chancellor, Hitler used the Reichstag Fire (the assembly location for parliament) as an excuse to issue a decree that overrode individual rights and authorized mass arrests. A month later, the Enabling Act\u00a0was passed, granting him full power without having to consult other government representatives.\nLess than three months after his appointment to chancellor, all non-Nazi parties, organizations and labor unions ceased to exist. By 1934, the chancellorship and the presidency were merged, securing his position as \"F\u00fchrer.\"\nThere is no evidence Hitler said or wrote this statement, and it could not be found in Mein Kampf.
