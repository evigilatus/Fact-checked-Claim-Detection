Bill Young\u2019s open seat. Kathleen Peters is more than happy to oblige.\nIn a mailer sent to voters, Peters\u2019 campaign declares, \"Since 2007, David Jolly has given almost $30,000 to keep Democrats in Congress!\" It then adds \"(But not a dime to Congressman Bill Young)\" before launching into a number of bullet points about how Jolly has supported his rival party.\nLobbyists typically work both sides of the aisle in Congress depending on who can help their causes the most. We wanted to know if the mailer was telling the full story. Time to dig into the public record.\nMr. Jolly goes to Washington\nThe mailer doesn\u2019t say it, but Dunedin native David Jolly worked for Young for several years. Jolly has played up his connection to Young, for whom he worked full time from 1995 to 2006. Jolly held various positions, with a brief break in 2001 when he took six months off to work at a Washington securities firm. In 2002, Young named Jolly his general counsel, a position Jolly held through 2006. \u00a0\nIn 2007, Jolly began work as a lobbyist with Washington firm Van Scoyoc Associates. Eventually, he opened his own firm, Three Bridges Advisors. Jolly officially took his name off the Lobby Registry in order to run for the vacant House seat.\nPeters has spent a lot of time making hay over Jolly\u2019s past as a lobbyist, illustrating why it is so difficult for a lobbyist to run for office (leaving office to become a lobbyist is nowhere near as difficult -- or as uncommon).\nHer mailer says, \"In the past three election cycles, Washington Lobbyist David Jolly has made nearly $30,000 in personal contributions to the campaigns of Democrats in Congress -- liberals who have forced Obamacare on America and have fought responsible Republican policies.\"\nThe flier then lists 13 \"Jolly Good\" Democratic senators and representatives to whom Jolly has given campaign contributions. Among the baker\u2019s dozen are Florida\u2019s own Sen. Bill Nelson (who received $4,500 in direct contributions and through his PAC, Moving America Forward), Rep. Kathy Castor ($3,600) and former Rep. Allen Boyd ($7,500). Boyd, who was defeated for re-election by Republican Steve Southerland in 2010, is now a lobbyist for the Twenty-First Century Group.\nThe list also includes other Democrats from around the nation, including Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin ($1,000), late Hawaii Sen. Daniel Inouye ($1,000), Maine Rep. Mike Michaud ($2,250) and former Illinois Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. ($2,300), who was sentenced in August to 30 months in prison for wire and mail fraud for using campaign contributions for personal expenses.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe total listed on the mailing was $28,622, a number PolitiFact Florida confirmed through Federal Elections Commission filings from 2007 to 2013.\nWhat the mailer doesn\u2019t mention is that Jolly also gave thousands to Republicans. Some noteworthy recipients include Rep. Gus Bilirakis ($9,350), Rep. Dennis Ross ($4,104), Rep. Richard Nugent ($4,629), Arizona Sen. John McCain\u2019s presidential campaign ($2,300) and former Florida Sen. Mel Martinez ($1,500). Jolly also gave then-Republican Gov. Charlie Crist $500 during his failed Senate bid.\nIn all, Jolly the lobbyist gave more than $34,000 to Republican politicians, candidates and organizations over the past six years.\nJolly has maintained that paying both Democrats and Republicans is the cost of doing business as a lobbyist. \"My giving has always followed my personal relationships,\" he told PolitiFact Florida. He said in the case of Democrats, the contributions were for candidates and Congress members in races that weren\u2019t close and had defense and national security priorities that matched his own.\nIt\u2019s been noted in coverage of the 13th Congressional District race as well as the mailing in question that Jolly hadn\u2019t given any money to Young, which Jolly confirms is true. But it wasn\u2019t for a lack of trying, he said.\n\"I actually gave him money, and he did not accept it,\" Jolly added, repeating a favored anecdote about Young literally tearing up the check. He said he often worked to get money for Young by organizing host committees for fundraisers.\nOur ruling\nPeters\u2019 mailer said Jolly \"has given almost $30,000 to keep Democrats in Congress\" in the form of campaign contributions.\nThe total on the flier, which we confirmed and Jolly did not dispute, is $28,622. That sounds like almost $30,000 to us. But Jolly has given even more to Republicans, and he was a staff member to Young for several years. \u00a0\nThe statement is accurate but needs clarification. We rate this statement Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08458"}
