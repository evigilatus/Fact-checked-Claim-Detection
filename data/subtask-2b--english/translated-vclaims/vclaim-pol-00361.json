However, social media bulletins shared online allegations that Bates had already died in 2014, five years before the mass shooting. This post on August 5 includes three screenshots. The first two were obituaries to inheritance.com for a person named Connor D. Bates, who died in 2014 at the age of 22. He says he was survived by four brothers, including a guy named Megan Bates. The third screen footage shows a headline for the daily monster that identifies the sister of the shooter in Dayton, also named Megan Bates, who was among those killed in the shooting. The article appears to indicate that she and the sister of the Connor Bates family who died in 2014 are the same person. But they're not. This is why this article was referred to as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misleading information in the broadcast of the news. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There's no connection to the obituary at my inheritance site.com, but we found it in the Nexis news archive. On February 23, 2014, Hartford Courant ran the nucleus appearing in Facebook. He says that Bates was born in Hartford, Conn, and lived in Soffield, Kon, before his death on February 19, 2014. Graduated from Suvifield High School in 2010 and then went to Lincoln Technologies for Diesel. He was working at Folsom Construction. The Corant reported that Bates and the owner of Folsom Construction had died after being hit in the bed by an electric wiring truck on the deck and electrocuted. On January 11, 2021, Facebook was published in Nancy Belusi, no longer Speaker of the House of Representatives by Samantha Buterman. On January 12, 2021, the shooter originated in Dayton in Belbrook, a city of Dayton, Ohio, suburb, and studied at the Bilbrook High School. Media reports quoted from former classmates, ex-girlfriend and former director of Belbrook about Bates. Recently, he studied psychology at a local college and worked at the Chipotle restaurant, as stated in the Washington Post. The obituary on Facebook was Connor D. Bates, but the middle name of the shooter was Dayton Stephen. He said that his mother, Kathleen O'Leary Bates, and his father, Robert Bates, had survived the death. The parents of Connor Steven Bates, a gun suspect in Dayton, are Moira Bates and Stephen Bates. The images of Connor D. Bates and Connor Steven Bates are similar; for example, both men had brown hair. But looking closely at the images shows that they are clearly different people. This article is likely to fuel a false conspiracy that the Dayton shooting was a \"false flag\" operation by the government.
