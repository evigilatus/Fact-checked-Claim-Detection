Many consider it a model for national health care reform -- even critics, who say that Massachusetts\u2019 problems with cost controls mean the national plan will have similar problems.\n\nBut Deval Patrick, the Democratic governor of the state, said the cost overruns aren\u2019t as dramatic as some are claiming, when asked about it on This Week with Christiane Amanpour.\n\n\"Actually, it's added about 1 percent to our state budget, which is not what is generally reported on out there, but that is the truth,\" Patrick said.\n\nPatrick added that the plan in Massachusetts was to cover the uninsured and then address cost controls. \"And just as we have shown the nation how to provide universal care through a public-private model, I think we can crack the code on health care costs as well,\" he said.\n\nPatrick promoted his own plan for reducing costs by paying doctors and hospitals for healthy outcomes, not per procedure.\n\nWe were interested in fact-checking Patrick\u2019s statement that the 2006 Massachusetts health care law, signed by then-Gov. Mitt Romney, had added only 1 percent to the state budget.\n\nWe contacted Patrick\u2019s office but didn\u2019t hear back. Meanwhile, we tracked the claim back to a report from the Massachusetts Taxpayers\u2019 Foundation, a nonpartisan policy research group backed by business that regularly analyzes state fiscal issues.\n\nA report published in 2009 found that the state\u2019s share of health care spending increased by $353 million in fiscal year 2010. The state\u2019s entire budget is roughly $30 billion, so that comes out to about 1 percent, said Michael Widmer, the group\u2019s president. He said the group has not updated the analysis with more recent numbers but has seen nothing to indicate the trend is any different.\n\nThere\u2019s some fine print to explain about the group\u2019s analysis, though. The foundation arrived at its number by adding health care spending increases for expanding coverage. But it also subtracted money the state would have spent under the old system on care for the uninsured and the state\u2019s old Medicaid program.\n\nAn analysis by Michael Tanner of the libertarian Cato Institute in 2009 took issue with the study\u2019s focus solely on the state budget. The federal government significantly increased Medicaid aid to Massachusetts as a result of the new law. Additionally, businesses and individuals had to spend more on insurance to satisfy new requirements that everyone have health insurance.\n\nWidmer of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation agreed that the federal government did pay more money for the Massachusetts health plan. Also, some of the uninsured also paid for care that the state paid for before, he said.\n\n\"That\u2019s why the piece around the state budget has always been modest,\" Widmer said.\"We\u2019re not trying to pretend it didn\u2019t cost any additional money to insure 400,000 additional people.\"\n\nPatrick said his state\u2019s health care law \"added about 1 percent to our state budget,\" and an independent analysis confirms that. There were additional costs for the health care plan outside of the state budget, so Patrick was right as far as the state budget goes. But because it's only one piece of a picture that includes increased federal spending, we rate his statement Mostly True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.
