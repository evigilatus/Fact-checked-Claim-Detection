Blunt overstates White House policy's impact on coal jobs", "text": "Supporters of the coal industry have criticized President Barack Obama\u2019s administration as it attempts to establish stricter environmental regulations on coal-fired plants in the U.S.\n\n\nThe Clean Power Plan is the administration\u2019s latest initiative to combat climate change. The Environmental Protection Agency proposes restrictions on coal-fired plants to reduce carbon emissions.\n\n\nOn Feb. 9 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the Clean Power Plan would not be allowed to go into effect until the court is able to hear arguments from those who support and oppose the plan.\n\n\nBefore that ruling, Republican Sen. Roy Blunt spoke out against the Clean Power Plan in a January press release.\n\n\nBlunt said: \"The administration\u2019s regulatory assault on coal-fired energy has put thousands of Americans out of work, and threatens to double utility costs for Missouri families by 2020.\"\n\n\nWe decided to look into that statement.\n\n\nEmployment in the coal industry\n\n\nEmployment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows jobs in coal were declining well before Obama took office in 2009. Coal mining employment has been dropping since 1985.\n\n\nThere are a number of market factors contributing to the long downturn, including technological innovation, investments in natural gas and renewable energy.\n\n\nPolitiFact has reported on the Obama administration\u2019s impact on the coal industry before and found coal has been losing to natural gas\u00a0for a while now. Natural gas\u00a0attracts companieslooking for cheaper, cleaner and more efficient energy.\n\n\nEmployment in the coal industry has declined faster since Obama\u2019s first term, but Josh Bivens, research and policy director at the Economic Policy Institute, a group that receives significant funding from labor unions, says regulations adopted by the administration so far probably only had a marginal effect.\u00a0Instead, the decline has to do more with cheaper natural gas.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Boysko\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in a committee debate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe United States is the only industrialized, modernized country that does not already have a paid family medical leave program in place.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"More than anything to me, they\u2019re just sort of locking in the coal declines that were originally caused by the decline in natural gas prices,\" Bivens said. \"The single biggest factor in the decline of the coal sector over the past decade has been the big fall in the price of natural gas.\"\n\n\nBivens added that if the Clean Power Plan goes into effect, he expects jobs in the coal industry to decline further.\n\n\nElectric bills\n\n\nWe can\u2019t fact-check a prediction, so Blunt\u2019s assertion about the doubling of utility costs is beyond the scope of this fact-check. But we did look into the source behind his forecast. Blunt spokesman Brian Hart pointed us to\u00a0this study\u00a0on behalf of a group of Midwest utilities and regulators.\u00a0\n\n\nWe found two significant issues.\n\n\nFirst, the study says Missouri electricity bills could possibly double by 2030, not 2020.\n\n\nSecond, the study was conducted in 2009, but Obama and the EPA didn\u2019t actually propose the Clean Power Plan until 2015. The methodologies used to conduct the study aren\u2019t consistent with Obama\u2019s current environmental proposal.\n\n\nBut we did\u00a0find a study from the U.S. Environmental Information Administration\u00a0that specifically breaks down how the Clean Power Plan will affect electrical utilities.\n\n\nThat agency predicts electricity prices\u00a0will rise slightly in the early 2020s. Prices will differ across the country, but the highest rise in prices is predicted to be 7 percent.\n\n\nOur ruling\n\n\nBlunt said the Obama administration\u2019s regulations have caused thousands of workers in the coal industry to lose their jobs. While the decline in coal industry employment is real, the role of administration policy is less certain.\n\n\nExperts note that competition from abundant, cheap natural gas has reduced the demand for coal more than any other factor. With less demand, the need for workers falls. While the administration has encouraged movement away from coal for environmental reasons, market forces in the energy sector have been the dominant driver.\n\n\nWhile it is impossible to know how utility costs will rise or fall in the future, the study on which Blunt based his claims was conducted before the Clean Power Plan was enacted.\n\n\nBlunt\u2019s claim overemphasizes the role of White House policy.\u00a0We rate the statement Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05262"}
