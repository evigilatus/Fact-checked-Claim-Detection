But while it\u2019s possible that some human traffickers have used white vans to kidnap their victims, there\u2019s generally no way to predict what type of vehicle a trafficker or other criminal would drive.\nMore to the point, there\u2019s no evidence that white vans with external locks are an especially common getaway ride for kidnappers. Like a pair of similar hoaxes we debunked related to zip ties and sex trafficking, this post seems alarmist.\u00a0\n\nA screenshot of a viral Facebook post warning that white vans with external locks are used by sex traffickers.\u200b\nWhen we searched news archives, we didn\u2019t find a swarm of reports about human traffickers who used external locks to trap people inside their white vans and drive away.\u00a0\nInstead, we found a number of reports \u2014 from fact-checkers as well as local and national news outlets \u2014 that debunked viral Facebook posts that were fooling people into believing most white vans belonged to sex traffickers.\nSome outlets, like Lead Stories, knocked down posts claiming white vans with external locks are the vehicle of choice for sex traffickers, noting that such locks are widely available for sale online and commonly used by workers who use expensive tools on the job.\nOthers dealt with similar posts that warned about white vans more generally. These posts reportedly took off after Baltimore Mayor Jack Young issued a warning about white vans that he claimed, without evidence, were \"trying to snatch up young girls for human trafficking.\"\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYoung said he got word of such incidents from Facebook rather than from the Baltimore Police Department, which later told reporters it had no reports of actual incidents that involved sex traffickers driving white vans with external locks.\nA number of white-van owners have reported being harassed since posts associating their vehicles with sex trafficking have cropped up, according to Business Insider.\nThe FBI declined to comment when we asked if incidents involving white vans were frequent or if white vans with external locks presented any particular reason for concern.\nBut Robert Lowery, vice president of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, told Yahoo News that \"of the 420,000 missing children last year, there were around 30 or 40 physical abductions that involved, for example, grabbing them in public.\"\n\"Although that\u2019s too many and it does happen, these scenarios are rare,\" he said.\nIn a statement to PolitiFact, the Polaris Project, a nonprofit organization that works to combat human trafficking, said it hasn\u2019t identified white vans with external locks as a trend.\nHuman trafficking often occurs between people that know each other, rather than complete strangers, and people being trafficked aren\u2019t always physically restrained, locked away or held against their will, the group said.\n\"By far the most pervasive myth about human trafficking is that it always \u2014 or often \u2014 involves kidnapping or otherwise physically forcing someone into a situation,\" the Polaris Project said in its statement. \"In reality, most human traffickers use psychological means such as tricking, defrauding, manipulating or threatening victims.\"\nShared Hope International, a nonprofit Christian organization with a similar mission, told us that \"trafficking victims are generally not kidnapped or taken away from their families abruptly.\"\n\"Many people don\u2019t realize sex trafficking exists in their community, but it impacts people everywhere,\" the organization said. \"Those who are concerned about sex trafficking and want to prevent people from being exploited should start by educating themselves and getting the facts.\"\nIt\u2019s important to stay aware of your surroundings, and should you want to report or seek services related to a case of human trafficking, you can contact the National Human Trafficking Hotline at 1-888-373-7888 or email [email\u00a0protected].\nBut the Facebook post about white vans with external locks seems like an example of an alarmist and unsubstantiated warning. So we rate it False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17500"}
