The EPI's data says that in Georgia, infant care costs an average of $7,644 a year, 15.6 percent more than the state\u2019s annual average in-state tuition. \u00a0\nThe EPI\u2019s estimated infant costs come from Child Care Aware of America\u2019s 2015 \"Parents and the High Cost of Child Care\" report. The report calculates the averages of two types of infant care, care offered at a facility and care offered at someone\u2019s home.The $7,644 used by the EPI is\u00a0the more expensive type of infant care, care offered at a facility. According to the report, the average cost of childcare provided in a caregiver\u2019s home in Georgia is $5,980 a year.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to EPI, Georgia's average in-state tuition estimate was taken from a 2014 survey conducted by the National Center of Education Statistics, a division of the U.S. Education Department. The total cost of tuition and required fees in a public university in Georgia averages out to $6,614 a year.\nSo Abrams' number is accurate if the comparison is between child care at a facility and in-state college tuition. But it\u2019s not correct if the comparison is with child care provided in a home.\nAbrams is not the first, and possibly not the last politician to make this type of comparison. Back in 2014, PolitiFact checked President Barack Obama's claim that in 31 states \"decent\" childcare cost more than college tuition. Back then, Obama also used Child Care Aware of America as a source. We rated his claim as Mostly True.\nOur ruling\nAbrams tweeted, \"The average cost for infant care in GA is almost $7,700/yr \u2013 more than average in-state college tuition.\"\nAbrams is correct if the comparison is between child care at a facility and college tuition, at $7,644 vs. $6,614. But child care offered in someone\u2019s home -- at $5,980 -- is less that in-state college tuition.\nThe statement is partially accurate but leaves out important facts. We rate this statement Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02661"}
