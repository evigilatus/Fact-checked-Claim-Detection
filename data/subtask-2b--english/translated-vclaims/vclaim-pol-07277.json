Tom Cotton, R-Ark, took some heat to vote against the final version of the farm bill - especially because he was the only legal manufacturer from Arkansas, the State dependent on agriculture, to do so. Now, the Republican Senate candidate is out with an announcement to defend his vote, arguing that he was financially responsible. The 30-second spot shows Cotton and his father on their family farm. Cotton says his father taught him financial lessons to take in his current role. \" (Daddy) taught me early: farmers can't spend more than they understand, and I listened,\" said Cotton in the ad. \"When President Obama kidnapped the farm bill, and turned it into a food bill, with billions more in spending, I voted no.\" According to Mark Brewer, the farm bill was a case of politicians taking a bad idea (food stamps) and linking it to a good idea (the farm bill). Is that right? Is Obama really to blame? We've had a good look. Food assistance legislation has been linked to agriculture for decades. The first farm bill was passed by Congress in 1933, during the Great Depression and the Dust Paul period, to assist farmers with low commodity and dry soil prices in the Middle West. In order to combat poverty among the general population, the draft law also established a programme of nutritional assistance. The programme seized surplus crops, meat and dairy products and distributed them to those in need. The programme became known as \"food stamps\" in 1939, under the supervision of the Ministry of Agriculture, in accordance with the National Health Programme, an organization aimed at improving health among recipients to help purchase food. This programme ended in 1943 but was re-established at the national level in 1964 as the Food Stamps Act, part of President Lyndon Johnson &apos; s great community programme to address poverty. In this repetition, the philatelic policy was not addressed in farm bills, but the Minister of Agriculture ran the programme. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 On January 11, 2012, the farm bill and food stamps merged again in 1973. In the view of representatives from urban and rural areas, such a collection would help to obtain broad support in Congress, according to an article by the New York University Professor of Law, John Ferrigone. Since then, a programme - currently called the Supplementary Food Assistance Programme - has become part of every farm bill that has become law, according to a report issued by the Congressional Research Service in December 2013. Today, a farm bill is passed almost every five years, and food and agriculture policy is re-authorised, including measures such as crop and commodity subsidies, conservation programmes, agricultural research and food stamps. In 2013, the home - led by Republicans, including Cotton - became the first room to pass a farm bill without food stamps. However, this bill was not able to approve the Senate, and the final Farming Bill, which became law in February 2014, contained food stamps. How does this history shed light on the accuracy of Cotton's claim? In 2013, Obama supported the passage of the farm bill, which included food stamps, with the White House issuing a comprehensive report in November 2013, entitled \"Economic importance of a comprehensive draft law on food, agriculture and jobs.\" But the idea of merging the two topics into a single bill came barely from Obama. This has been the case, without interruption, since 1973 - when Obama was not yet a teenager. While the number of philatelic beneficiaries increased significantly following the recent recession, which was eventually at the time Obama took office, philatelic stamps accounted for the majority of farm billing spending for more than a decade. The bill passed in 2014 has approximately $1 trillion in price cards over 10 years, 80 per cent of which goes to food assistance. In the 2008 version of the draft law, 67 per cent of the expenditure was allocated to nutritional assistance. In the 2002 bill, about 55 per cent of expenditure went to nutritional assistance. The governor Cotton said Obama stole the farm bill, and turned it into a food bill. This is not true - food stamps have been part of every draft law enacted since 1973. One can say that Cotton and his allies in the House of Representatives, through the search for a farm bill stripped of food stamps, were in fact those who took a more radical step, one against which Congress eventually voted.
