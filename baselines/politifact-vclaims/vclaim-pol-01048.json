Schiff has announced the committee will look at connections between the Trump campaign and Russia:\n\"So now Congressman Adam Schiff announces, after having found zero Russian Collusion, that he is going to be looking at every aspect of my life, both financial and personal, even though there is no reason to be doing so.

I hear other committee heads will do the same thing. Even stealing people who work at White House! A continuation of Witch Hunt!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 7, 2019\n\nIn this article, we will look at whether Republican-led congressional committees \"never did this to President Obama.\"\nShort answer: They certainly did investigate Obama, though the subjects were different.\nThe White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article.\nA look back\nDuring the Obama years -- as in previous presidencies -- Congress regularly asserted its right to conduct oversight on the executive branch. This oversight can be particularly aggressive when at least one chamber of Congress is controlled by the opposite party of the one holding the White House.\nFor the final six years of Obama\u2019s presidency -- 2011 to 2017 -- Republicans controlled at least one chamber of Congress. Not all congressional committee investigations are identical -- some target in-the-weeds concerns deep within executive branch departments, far from the higher echelons of the White House.\nBut others quickly take on a partisan cast, with the findings reflecting on the president, his top aides, or his core agenda.\nWe\u2019re not aware of any congressional investigations into Obama\u2019s personal finances, as could happen to Trump, whose business and real estate holdings are much more extensive than Obama\u2019s. One possible Democratic effort, to obtain Trump\u2019s tax returns, wasn\u2019t needed under Obama because Obama released his voluntarily, as had all presidents going back to Richard Nixon.\nBut while the nature of the controversies were different, we found at least five examples of congressional investigations in which congressional Republicans used the investigation process to put Obama on the political hot seat:\n\u2022 Loans to the solar company Solyndra. The company collapsed after taking a $535 million federal loan guarantee, and Republicans noted that a campaign bundler for Obama was a key investor.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJake Tapper\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in remarks in a CNN broadcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second presidential impeachment of Donald Trump was \u201cthe most bipartisan impeachment in American history.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe loan default prompted an investigation by the House Energy and Commerce Committee.\n\u2022 Alleged political bias at the Internal Revenue Service. This controversy involved charges that IRS officials were unfairly targeting conservative groups for unusual scrutiny in applications to become a tax-exempt organization.\nThis attracted an investigation by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, the Senate Finance Committee, and a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs subcommittee.\n\u2022 The Benghazi consulate terrorist attack in 2012, in which four Americans died, including the U.S. ambassador.\nThe circumstances surrounding the attack were investigated by the Senate Intelligence Committee, the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, several House panels led by the House Intelligence Committee, and a specially created House Benghazi committee. In 2015, the specially created committee called Hillary Clinton -- who had been secretary of state during the attack and who was widely expected to run for president -- for a full day of televised testimony. (The two Senate investigations were actually conducted by a Democratic majority of a Democratic president.)\n\u2022 The \"gun-walking\" program known as Fast & Furious, in which the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, partly during Obama\u2019s presidency, allowed guns to be sold to Mexican nationals in the hopes of tracking down drug cartel leaders.\nThe program was investigated jointly by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\u2022 The botched 2014 launch of the Affordable Care Act website, healthcare.gov. At first, the website was largely inoperable, though the government was eventually able to fix it.\nThe rollout was the subject of hearings by the Energy and Commerce Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, the Senate Finance Committee, the House Ways and Means Committee, and the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that prior to becoming president, Trump himself tweeted actively about these five controversies, mostly to cheer on the probes or to criticize the Obama administration.\nAccording to searches through the Trump Twitter Archive, Trump tweeted 15 times on Solyndra, 13 times on Fast & Furious, three times about the IRS bias controversy, 58 times on Benghazi, and 28 times about the problems of the Affordable Care Act website.\nOur ruling\nTrump tweeted, \"The Dems and their committees are going \u2018nuts.\u2019 The Republicans never did this to President Obama.\"\nObama didn't face the types of investigations of his personal and financial life the Trump did, partly because Obama was more transparent about his holdings and his personal finances were less complicated.\nStill, the Republican-led House and Senate actively pursued several investigations in which\u00a0Obama and his administration were put through a wringer. The topics included Solyndra, Fast & Furious, alleged IRS bias, Benghazi and the Affordable Care Act website. To one degree or another, the Republican-led probes -- often conducted by overlapping committees in one or both chambers -- were a mix of legitimate governmental oversight and partisan warfare.\nWe rate the statement Mostly False.\n Share the Facts 2019-02-07 23:39:11 UTC   PolitiFact    3 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly False  \"The Dems and their committees are going \u2018nuts.\u2019 The Republicans never did this to President Obama.\"    Donald Trump President https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1093471134845190145   a tweet Thursday, February 7, 2019 2019-02-07    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01048"}
