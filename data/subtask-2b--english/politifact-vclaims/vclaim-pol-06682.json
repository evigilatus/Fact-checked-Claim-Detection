O'Reilly disputed the story and called Corn \"an irresponsible guttersnipe.\"\u00a0We\u2019ll leave it to you to decide who to believe in that he-said, he-said.\nBut we were struck by something Corn said during an appearance on the Feb. 25, 2015, Rachel Maddow Show. Apparently, Corn once worked for Fox News, and he and O\u2019Reilly were something of pals. Here\u2019s how Corn put it:\n\"I\u2019ve watched Bill O\u2019Reilly over the years. In fact I used to work there from 2001 to 2008, and was often on Bill\u2019s show and often was praised by Bill, not as a liar but as a good reporter. But that was then. This is now.\" Corn said.\nThat\u2019s an interesting little nugget in this media story that we thought was worth verifying.\nAs it turns out, when Corn was the Washington editor of The Nation, a long standing left-of-center publication, he had a contract with Fox News and played the role of arch liberal against the network\u2019s roster of conservative voices. We went to the Nexis transcript database to see how many times Corn appeared and what O\u2019Reilly said about him.\nCorn appeared on Fox News at least\u00a060 times. Six of those appearances came on O\u2019Reilly\u2019s The O\u2019Reilly Factor (May 3, 2002; Nov. 18, 2002; Jan. 15, 2003; March 4, 2003; April 7, 2003; and April 20, 2007).\nSix appearances over five years is hardly often, but what did O\u2019Reilly have to say about Corn?\nWe found one occasion when O\u2019Reilly explicitly praised Corn\u2019s reporting. In November 2002, a few months before the Iraq War, Corn wrote that a small socialist group called the Worker\u2019s World Party had played a key role in organizing a large anti-war demonstration. O\u2019Reilly clearly valued journalism that revealed a tie between the protest march and a group that O\u2019Reilly called \"hardcore commies.\"\n\"All right, Mr. Corn, good reporting,\" O\u2019Reilly said. \"Nobody else reported that. And we appreciate it.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat was as effusive as O\u2019Reilly ever got with Corn. The two men always sparred aggressively, transcripts show. A couple of weeks before the start of the Iraq War, Corn argued that the evidence was thin that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and that the United States was ill prepared for the aftermath of an invasion. O\u2019Reilly said an invasion was worth the risk, but at the end, appreciated Corn for his feistiness.\n\"Mr. Corn, we appreciate your point of view. Thanks for coming in, and standing up,\" he said.\nAfter the war began, Corn appeared again to challenge O\u2019Reilly\u2019s belief that papers like the New York Times slanted their headlines to make the fight look tougher for American forces than it actually was. As the segment clock ran down, O\u2019Reilly threw it back to Corn.\n\"David, because we like you as a guest, give you the last word. You've got 15 seconds. Go,\" O\u2019Reilly said.\nOn one occasion O\u2019Reilly called Corn \"a left-wing, liberal, pinko communist,\" a remark that Corn took in good humor. Once, O\u2019Reilly accused Corn of intellectual dishonesty. O\u2019Reilly also described Corn and journalist Robert Scheer in 2006 as \"bomb throwers\" and \"very far-left individuals.\"\nWe spoke to the Mother Jones public affairs director, shared the results of our Nexis search and asked if there were any other details we should know. We did not hear back and will post an update if we do.\nOur ruling\nCorn said that before this current brouhaha with O\u2019Reilly, he appeared often on O\u2019Reilly\u2019s show and was often praised by the Fox News host.\nCorn\u2019s use of the word \"often\" wouldn\u2019t pass the eye test of most fact-checkers. While Corn was a guest on Fox News programs many times, he had just six appearances with O\u2019Reilly between 2001 and 2008, transcripts show.\nAnd as for praise, O\u2019Reilly explicitly did so once. A few other times O\u2019Reilly expressed his satisfaction with Corn as a spokesman for a liberal perspective. But he also described him as bomb thrower and very far-left individual.\nCorn\u2019s statement is partially accurate but takes things out of context.\nWe rate the claim Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06682"}
