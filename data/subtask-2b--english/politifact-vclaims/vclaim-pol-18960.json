Bowers was once the head of the bank\u2019s American wealth-management division, where he oversaw Trump\u2019s private banker. The article doesn\u2019t mention Epstein.\u00a0\nBut Epstein, a financier, has close ties to Deutsche Bank. Deutsche Bank recently agreed to pay a $150 million fine for its dealings with Epstein, the New York Times reported in a July article titled: \"These are the Deutsche Bank executives responsible for serving Jeffrey Epstein.\"\nThe bank itself hasn\u2019t publicly identified the individuals who worked with Epstein but based on descriptions of the employees in a consent order with the New York Department of Financial Services, and interviews with current and former bank officials, the Times identified nearly everyone in the legal document, according to the story.\u00a0\nPaul Morris, who had previously helped Epstein manage an account at JPMorgan, brought Epstein to Deutsche Bank, the Times reported. Because Morris needed approval for a client who carried a reputational risk \u2014 Epstein had been convicted in 2008 of soliciting prostitution from a minor \u2014\u00a0he sent a memo to Charles Packard, then the head of the bank\u2019s American wealth-management division that detailed Epstein\u2019s past.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther bank officials are mentioned in the article but not Bowers.\u00a0\nWe found no credible sources corroborating the Facebook post\u2019s claim that Bowers was Epstein\u2019s \"private banker.\"\u00a0\nDeutsche Bank also connects Epstein to Judge Esther Salas, a federal judge whose son was killed and her husband injured in a shooting at their New Jersey home in July.\u00a0\nSalas has presided over a class action lawsuit brought against the bank by investors who claim it made false and misleading statements about its anti-money laundering policies, according to the Associated Press, and because it failed to monitor \"high-risk\" customers like Epstein.\nThe lawyer suspected in the shooting at Salas\u2019 home was Roy Den Hollander, a self-described \"anti-feminist\" who had compiled a dossier on her and her family and arrived at their home that morning carrying a FedEx package.\u00a0\n\"He was apparently angry at Judge Salas for not moving quickly enough on a lawsuit he had brought challenging the constitutionality of the male-only draft,\" according to the Times.\u00a0\nDays before the shooting at Salas\u2019 residence, Hollander had traveled to San Bernardino County, Calif., where authorities say he shot and killed a rival men\u2019s rights lawyer at his home.
