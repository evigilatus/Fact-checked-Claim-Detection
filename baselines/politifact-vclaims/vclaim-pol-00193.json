But there are two governors who\u2019ve apologized for wearing blackface.\u00a0\nSinyangwe\u2019s tweet came on the heels of an Aug. 29 report that Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey had apologized after audio emerged of a 52-year-old radio interview in which she talked about wearing blackface for a student skit at Auburn University.\nIn February, Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam said he was one of two men pictured in a racist yearbook photograph from 1984, which showed one man dressed in blackface and another in a Ku Klux Klan robe. At the time, Northam did not say which costume he was wearing. But he later recanted his apology, saying neither man in the photograph was him.\u00a0\nAn investigation commissioned by Eastern Virginia Medical School, where Northam got his medical degree, did not conclude whether Northam was in the picture from its 1984 yearbook.\n\"With respect to the photograph on Gov. Northam\u2019s personal page, we could not conclusively determine the identity of either individual depicted in the photograph,\" the final report said. \"The governor himself has made inconsistent public statements in this regard.\"\nWhen Northam said the investigation \"confirmed what I said all along, that I\u2019m not in the picture,\" we rated his statement False.\nDepending on whether you count Northam, there\u2019s at least one governor \u2014 and possibly a second \u2014 who has owned up to wearing blackface in the past.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, there are currently no black governors, according to Rutgers University\u2019s Center on the American Governor. Out of 50 sitting governors, 47 are white, and the remaining three are Hispanic, Asian American and Native American.\nOnly two African Americans have been elected governor, with the most recent being Democrat Deval Patrick, who was voted into office in Massachusetts in 2006. Democrat Douglas Wilder had previously been elected as Virginia\u2019s governor, a post he held from 1990 to 1994.\nBefore Wilder\u2019s election, the only black governor had been P. B. S. Pinchback, who stepped in as Louisiana\u2019s governor for 34 days in 1872 while the incumbent faced impeachment, according to CBS News. In 2008, Democrat David Paterson was also appointed governor of New York after Eliot Spitzer resigned.\nDemocrats Stacey Abrams, Andrew Gillum and Ben Jealous, all black, lost gubernatorial races in Georgia, Florida and Maryland in 2018.\n\"When a lot of African Americans start their political careers, they often run in places with large or growing African American populations,\" said Andra Gillespie, professor of political science at Emory University. \"Given the fact that there is no state that has a majority black population, that presents a challenge.\"\nThat\u2019s why black candidates have been more successful getting elected as mayors of cities or members of Congress from urban districts with heavy black populations, said John Weingart, director of the Center on the American Governor.\n\"The two elected governors, certainly in the case of Deval Patrick, have been considered successful governors,\" he added. \"So it\u2019s not like getting one in necessarily opens the door.\"\nThere have still been plenty of predominantly white jurisdictions that have put black politicians in various offices, Gillespie said, but the \"historical norm\" is that black candidates fare better when black voters can get to the polls. For much of American history, that wasn\u2019t possible.\n\"For nearly 100 years after black rights to vote were protected by the 15th Amendment, a number of the states in which African Americans lived came up with ingenious ways to prevent African Amerricans from being able to exercise their right to vote,\" Gillespie said. \"What that did was shut off an opportunity for blacks to be able to run for office.\"\nIn an email to PolitiFact, Sinyangwe noted that the governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands, Albert Bryan, is black. The U.S. Virgin Islands is a territory, not a state.\nOur ruling\nSinyangwe said, \"America has more governors who\u2019ve worn blackface than black governors.\"\nThere are currently no black governors in the United States. But there\u2019s at least one, Ivey, who has admitted to wearing blackface in the past, and Northam has been accused of the same.\nWe rate this statement True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00193"}
