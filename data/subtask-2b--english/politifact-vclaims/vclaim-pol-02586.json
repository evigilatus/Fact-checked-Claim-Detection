Ryan referred to the 1986 reform, signed into law by Republican President Ronald Reagan, during this exchange:\nWeber: Are you losing the messaging war, though, with these polls showing half of the country doesn\u2019t like this plan? They clearly don\u2019t understand it.\nRyan: Yeah, I think that\u2019s right. You know, we went back and took solace in this. Gosh, everybody looks at the Reagan tax reform as such a phenomenal success \u2026.And guess what: The thing was polling at about 18 percent right before they passed it.\n\"Polling at about 18 percent\" is a bit vague, but let\u2019s see what the evidence shows.\nThe polls\nAs Weber indicated, December 2017 polls about the current tax reform show not only that support is low, but that opposition is high.\nThree examples: Only 25 percent approved of the way Republicans \"are handling\" tax reform and 63 percent disapproved (Marist); 26 percent approved \"of the Republican tax plan\" and 55 percent disapproved (Quinnipiac); and, among those who said they were aware of the tax plan, 31 percent said they supported it and 49 percent were opposed (Reuters/Ipsos).\nLet\u2019s be clear on the timing in terms of weighing Ryan\u2019s claim.\nOn the same morning of Ryan\u2019s interview, Republicans in Congress announced that House and Senate leaders had reached a deal on reconciling separate tax reform bills that had been approved in the House and the Senate. Details of the agreement had not been released. It was expected that the final bill would be ready for votes in the House and Senate the following week, with a goal of getting the bill to President Donald Trump before Christmas.\nIt\u2019s difficult to pinpoint when the 1986 tax reform effort was at the same stage as the current effort. But mid- to late-1986 would be roughly the time frame.\nAccording to a New York Times chronology, on July 17, 1986, \"in a room overflowing with lobbyists from every conceivable commercial interest, 11 senators and 11 representatives (began) the conference to write the final version of the legislation.\" The final version was approved by the House and Senate in late-September 1986. Reagan signed the bill Oct. 22, 1986.\nPolling experts told us they were surprised, after looking back, how relatively little polling was done about support for the 1986 tax reform at this stage in the process.\nRyan\u2019s office cited to us one result from a September 1986 Gallup Poll: 18 percent said they thought their taxes would decrease under the plan.\nBut that question isn\u2019t on point in terms of support or approval. More importantly, that poll was taken after the House-Senate conference committee had approved the 1986 bill. That step hadn\u2019t yet occurred when Ryan made his statement about the current reform.\nWe found four polls taken before that stage.\nTwo polls with results near Ryan\u2019s 18 percent claim\n\n\n\n\nPoll\n\n\nDate\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\nResults\n\n\n\n\nABC News/Washington Post Poll\n\n\nJune 1986\n\n\nFrom what you have read or heard, do you favor or oppose this tax bill, or don't you know enough about it to say?\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin LeMahieu\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a TV interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It takes quite a while on Election Day to load those ballots, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFavor: 22%\nOppose: 15%\nDon\u2019t Know/No opinion: 63%\n\n\n\n\nABC News/Washington Post Poll\n\n\nSept. 1986\n\n\nFrom what you have read or heard, do you favor or oppose this tax bill, or don\u2019t you know enough about it to say?\n\n\nFavor: 22%\nOppose: 15%\nDon\u2019t know enough about it to say: 63%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nSo, with identical results in both polls, the 22 percent Favor, which is seven points higher than Oppose, is close to Ryan\u2019s 18 percent claim -- even though a strong majority didn\u2019t choose either response.\nTwo polls with higher support -- and opposition\nThe other two polls, however, showed much higher support for the bill than Ryan indicated -- but also much higher opposition, as fewer respondents were on the fence:\n\n\n\n\nGallup Poll\n\n\nJune 1986\n\n\nFrom what you\u2019ve heard or read about it, would you say approve or disapprove of the latest tax reform proposal?\n\n\u00a0\n\nApprove: 38%\nDisapprove: 36%\nDon\u2019t Know: 26%\n\n\n\n\nGallup Poll\n\n\nAug. 1986\n\n\nFrom what you\u2019ve heard or read about it, would you say approve or disapprove of the latest tax reform proposal?\n\n\nApprove: 40%\nDisapprove 34%\nDon\u2019t Know: 26%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nThe 38 percent and 40 percent approval rates in those two polls are much higher than Ryan\u2019s 18 percent claim.\nMoreover, the disapproval rates show in polls on the current reform are much higher than those shown in the four 1986 polls. In that respect, the comparison Ryan draws is not entirely on point.\nOur rating\nRyan said the 1986 tax reform approved under Reagan \"was polling at about 18 percent right before they passed it.\"\nTwo national polls, taken at roughly the stage of where the current tax reform effort is, showed 22 percent favored the legislation. That\u2019s close to Ryan\u2019s 18 percent claim.\nBut two other polls showed approval of the bill at or near 40 percent, as more respondents were willing to choose Approve or Disapprove, rather than Don\u2019t Know. Moreover, the disapproval rates in polls on the current tax reform are much higher than they were in the 1986 polls.\nFor a statement that is partially accurate, we rate Ryan\u2019s statement Half True.
