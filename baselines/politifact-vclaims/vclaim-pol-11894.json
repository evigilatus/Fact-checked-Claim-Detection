America cannot spend \u2026 over 17 percent of its GDP on health care costs when our closest competitor nations are spending about 12,\" Booker said during a Dec. 9 speech in Manchester, N.H. \"We're not going to be able to sustain a bold economy unless we start controlling these costs. But I'll tell you one thing right now, I'll defend Barack Obama as the day is long because what he did to me was heroic.\"\n\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development keeps tabs on the health spending of the 34 nations that belong to the group.\n\nAccording to the organization\u2019s latest data, Booker\u2019s numbers are spot on.\n\nSpending on health care in the U.S. in 2009 totaled 17.4 percent of the country\u2019s gross domestic product. That puts the U.S. at the top of the group for medical spending.\n\nThe Netherlands took second place, at 12 percent of its gross domestic product. Following behind by tenths of a percentage point: France at 11.8 percent; Germany at 11.6 percent; Denmark at 11.5 percent; and Canada and Switzerland, both at 11.4 percent.\n\nPolitiFact New Jersey reached out to health care experts to gauge the significance of the difference.\n\nRobert Field, a professor of law and health management and policy at Drexel University, said in an email that \"experts differ on how much we should be concerned\" but, he said, \u00a0\"without question, there are two major worries - health care costs are the biggest driver of Medicare spending growth, which will be the biggest driver of federal deficit growth in coming years, and there is a tremendous amount of inefficiency, so we are not getting better health for our extra spending.\"\n\nDavid Auerbach, a health policy researcher with the RAND Corporation said there\u2019s \"cause for worry because we seem to be growing faster than [Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development] countries in the past decade or so.\"\n\n\"We still don't have much more in the system in the way of checks on spending and it could well continue into the future eating into government and personal spending for other needs,\" Auerbach said.\n\nOur ruling\n\nBooker claimed that the U.S. spends \"over 17 percent of its GDP on health care costs when our closest competitor nations are spending about 12.\"\n\nThe United States outspends 33 other large, industrialized democracies on medical costs. The country\u2019s health care spending hit 17.4 percent of the nation\u2019s economy in 2009, compared with 12 percent for the Netherlands, according to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\n\nWe rate the statement True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11894"}
