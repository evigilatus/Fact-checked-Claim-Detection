Clinton was one of dozens of attorneys hired by the U.S. House Judiciary Committee in 1972 to work on the Watergate impeachment inquiry. Zeifman, who was Democratic general counsel to the committee during the Watergate scandal, died in 2010, so we can\u2019t ask him if he fired her because she was a liar.\nBut other people have. In 1999, Lance Gay reported for the Scripps Howard News Service that Zeifman didn\u2019t have \"flattering memories\" of Clinton\u2019s work on the committee. \"If I had the power to fire her, I would have fired her,\" Gay quotes Zeifman as saying. Gay also interviewed Jay Woods, an Oakland attorney who supervised the lawyers, for the story. Gay, who described Woods as Clinton\u2019s \"ex-boss,\" reported that he described her as capable and cheerful.\nLess than a decade later, Zeifman changed his story, according to the Washington Post. In a 2008 interview on \"The Neal Boortz Show,\" fact-checker Glenn Kessler reports, Zeifman was asked directly if he fired her. \"Well, let me put it this way,\" he said. \"I terminated her, along with some other staff members who were \u2014 we no longer needed, and advised her that I would not \u2014 could not recommend her for further positions.\"\nThat year, an article by Dan Calabrese, founder of North Star Writers Group, claimed Zeifman was Clinton\u2019s supervisor and had fired her. Clinton, who was making her first run for president that year, denied the allegation. Calabrese also quotes Zeifman as making the same statement that appears in the Facebook post.\nBut Zeifman\u2019s credibility has been questioned over the years. In a 1996 review of his book, \"Without Honor: Crimes of Camelot and the Impeachment of President Nixon,\" Washington Post reviewer Matthew Dallek notes that Zeifman\u2019s book \"will surely excite conspiracy buffs on the lookout for sinister coverups in high places. But those wary of such unsubstantiated theories (myself included) will find Zeifman\u2019s book an unconvincing, if imaginative intrigue.\"\nSnopes points out that Zeifman didn\u2019t claim he fired Clinton in that book; it wasn\u2019t until later that his recollection changed. Perhaps the best proof of whether Clinton was fired or not is in her pay records. Judiciary Committee pay records that were unearthed in 2016 by Washington Post researcher Alice Crites show that Clinton was paid through Sept. 4, 1974\u2014after Nixon resigned on Aug. 9, 1974, and after the committee published its final impeachment report on Aug. 20, 1974.\nWe rate the claim that Hillary Clinton was fired from her job as a staff attorney during the during the Watergate investigation False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01442"}
