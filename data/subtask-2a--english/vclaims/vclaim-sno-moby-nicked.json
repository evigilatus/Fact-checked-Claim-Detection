  "vclaim": "A student in a marine biology class turns in a term paper which includes a lavishly-drawn illustration of a whale and receives an A.  The next year a different student copies the paper, submits it, and also receives an A.  The third student to hand in the same paper, however, neglects to include the drawing of the whale and receives only a B from the professor and his written comment: \u201cI liked it better with the whale.\u201d"
