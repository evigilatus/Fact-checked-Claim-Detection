This is all part of a larger Obama administration effort, announced last June in Cairo by the president himself, to change U.S. relations with the Muslim world through outreach and cooperation,\" the post states.\n\nWe launched our own review, first confirming that Bolden made his statement about Obama\u2019s expectations, according to Al Jazeera\u2019s video post of the interview, which aired June 30.\n\nAsked why he's in the Middle East, Bolden replies that he was there around the anniversary of President Obama's 2009 speech in Cairo vowing a new beginning in U.S. relations with the Muslim world. Bolden next lists the \"three things\" he says Obama charged him to do, including, \"perhaps foremost,\" engaging much more with dominantly Muslim nations and getting \"more people who can contribute to the things that we do,\" citing as past examples Russian and Japanese contributions to the International Space Station.\n\n\"There is much to be gained by drawing in the contributions that are possible from the Muslim nations,\" he says.\n\nBut the interview covers more ground. The four-time visitor to outer space defends his decision to focus NASA on international exploration of deep space plus his desire to use robots to deflect incoming asteroids away from Earth. Bolden said if an asteroid made of metal struck Earth, it could cause another Ice Age: \"Instead of the extinction of the dinosaurs, it would be the extinction of human man.\" (Talk about a missed tweet.)\n\nNext, we contacted NASA. Spokesman Michael Cabbage said in an e-mail: \"NASA\u2019s core mission remains one of space exploration, science and aeronautics. Administrator Bolden regrets that a statement he made during a recent interview mischaracterized that core mission. The success of NASA\u2019s efforts is increasingly enhanced by mutual cooperation with dozens of other countries around the world that are also committed to these efforts.\"\n\nDoes Sullivan's Twitter post make a successful landing?\n\nBolden said the president encouraged him to \"find a way to reach out to the Muslim world\" -- a goal he described as \"perhaps foremost.\" But it was mentioned in the same context as other goals -- inspiring kids, expanding international relationships -- suggesting Bolden was speaking not about NASA's obvious scientific purpose, but other activities. The focus on space is clear in the video of the Al Jazeera interview.\n\nSullivan's tweet says Bolden said NASA\u2019s \"main mission is Muslim outreach.\" That's akin to saying the agency is deserting outer space to concentrate on residents of the Nile Delta, which would be unbelievable. That said, Bolden acknowledged to PolitiFact that he mischaracterized the agency's main mission in the remark about Obama charging him to do three things. That is, he said something close to what Sullivan said he said \u2014 and wishes he hadn't.\n\nWe rate Sullivan\u2019s statement Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-14659"}
