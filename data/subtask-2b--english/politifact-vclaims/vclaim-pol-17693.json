Tony Evers in late May directed $100 million in federal CARES Act funding to nursing homes and other long-term care providers to ease the financial burden of the pandemic.\u00a0\nHow the state funds its nursing homes, then, became the subject of a May 23, 2020, Twitter exchange between state Rep. Jim Steineke, R-Kaukauna, and state Sen. Tim Carpenter, D-Milwaukee.\u00a0\nSteineke, who has said he believes Evers should have allocated more of the federal money to nursing homes, asked whether Carpenter also thought the facilities should have received a bigger piece of the CARES Act pie.\u00a0\nCarpenter responded, \"Why didn\u2019t the GOP increase state funding for nursing homes in the last budget?\"\u00a0\nDid nursing homes get a boost from the state in Wisconsin\u2019s last budget, or is Carpenter correct?\u00a0\nLet\u2019s dig in.\u00a0\nWhat\u2019s in that budget?\u00a0\nEvers sought to expand Medicaid and free up state tax dollars in the 2019-21 biennial budget by tapping into $1 billion in federal funds through the Affordable Care Act.\u00a0\nRepublican lawmakers on the Joint Finance Committee rejected that effort, but did allocate an additional $30 million in state dollars to nursing homes.\u00a0\nFor every 41 cents the state spends on most Medicaid programs, the federal government will spend 59 cents, meaning the full increase in funding for nursing homes in the current biennium totaled about $74 million.\u00a0\nSo the GOP did increase state funding for nursing homes in the last budget \u2014 just through state tax dollars, instead of Evers\u2019 proposed reliance on federal funds.\u00a0\nWhat did Carpenter argue?\u00a0\nWhen asked to provide evidence to back his claim, Carpenter pointed to a May 28, 2020 memo from the Legislative Fiscal Bureau \u2014 which he sought \u2014 detailing declining state and federal spending for medical assistance fee-for-service payments to nursing homes. That data does show the expenditures have been dropping since at least the 2011-12 fiscal year.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Steineke\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembly Republicans \u201chave come to the table\u201d and were part of \u201cgive and take\u201d compromise on a coronavirus bill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese payments designate how much money the state and the federal Medicaid program are paying nursing homes to care for seniors with limited resources.\u00a0\nBut the state is not spending less because state lawmakers failed to fund nursing homes. The state is spending less because fewer Medicaid recipients are choosing to live in nursing homes.\u00a0\nCare recipients are increasingly preferring to reside in non-nursing home settings, the memo says, favoring home and community-based settings or smaller, more home-like assisted living facilities.\u00a0\nThe total number of days that Medicaid pays for a senior in a Wisconsin nursing home has dropped nearly 40% in the last decade or so, from about 6 million days during the 2010-11 fiscal year to about 3.7 million days during the 2017-18 fiscal year, the memo says.\u00a0\nAs a result, with fewer days to pay for, spending declines.\nMeanwhile, the state has increased the dollar amount paid per day to nursing homes.\u00a0\nIn 2017, that rate was $174.61, according to a Department of Health Services spokeswoman. In 2018, it was $181.08, and in 2019, it was $191.50. The 2018-19 fiscal year\u2019s average daily rate is approximately 17% higher than it was during the 2010-11 fiscal year, the memo says.\u00a0\nThat said, even as rates increased, as the number of days paid decreased, total spending dropped.\nAnd, in any case, Carpenter\u2019s claim was limited to GOP actions in the most recent budget, not any decline over time.\nOur ruling\u00a0\nCarpenter claimed Republicans didn't \"increase state funding for nursing homes in the last budget.\"\nBut they did increase funding for nursing homes in the 2019-21 biennial budget, allocating $30 million in state dollars. When the federal match is included, that added up to about $74 million more.\u00a0\nCarpenter cited declining overall state spending on nursing homes, but the reason those expenditures decreased is because fewer Medicaid recipients are residing in nursing homes. Meanwhile, rates charged for those Medicaid recipients have increased over the years.\u00a0\nWe rate Carpenter\u2019s claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17693"}
