A draft law before the General Assembly would require all voters in Rhode Island to present an identity card with a photograph before they cast their votes. C. Harold Mets, D-Providence, and Foreign Minister Ralph Mollis, who worked together to introduce the bill, say that it would help prevent fraud and ensure the integrity of the elections. Critics argue that fraud is rare and that obtaining a valid identity card is an obstacle to the voting of the poor, the elderly, the disabled and ethnic minorities. In opposition to the bill, the Rhode Island organization of the American Civil Liberties Union announced in a news release, \"no other North-East State has published the Photo Identity Act.\" Is Rhode Island really alone among other countries in the region? We chose to know. We have directed both the Federation and the Office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, which stand on two opposing sides of the issue, to the bipartisan National Congress of the state legislatures. The first thing we learned is that nearly half of the states - including Rhode Island - only require voters to sign the ballot box. But that was changing fast. In 2000, only 15 states requested personal identity, such as birth certificate, social security card, photographic identity card or voter registration card. But today, the number rose to 28. This year, 13 other state legislatures have adopted voter identification legislation, including 8 that are considering extending their identity card requirements to include identity cards. Jenny Boser, her senior colleague at the National Congress of State Legislatures, said that the laws \"become more widespread and more stringent.\" \"He's been growing slowly over the past decade. There was a significant shift in activity this year.\" Photographic identity laws differ from what is considered to be an acceptable form of personal identity and who is exempt from showing personal identity. (For example, those whose religious beliefs prohibit photo identification) Another variable is what happens when someone arrives in a reconnaissance without an identity image. The Florida Board of Inquiry reviews whether the vote can be counted. (Hawai) Require voters without an identity photograph to read their address and date of birth. Several States accept a provisional ballot, but only count it when certain conditions have been met. Georgia, for example, gives voters two days to present a valid identity card. Idaho and Louisiana offer the option of a written statement, which, if falsely filled, could lead to criminal charges. The proposed law for Rhode Island (approved by the Senate, but held for further consideration in the House of Representatives) will enter into force in stages. As of 2012, voters will have to show the identity of the college, the driver &apos; s licence, the passport or any other government card issued. Photoless identity cards, such as a social security card or medical care card, will be accepted, but only until 2014. At that time, voters without an identity card with a photo will have two options. First, they will have to obtain, free of charge, an identity card for voters from the state before going to the polling station. Secondly, they must go to the polling stations and conduct a provisional ballot, which must be inspected by a review board before being counted. Now, back to ACULU's claim, are there any states with photo identification laws in the northeast? Since the Union does not say what it means in the north-east, we will use the definition developed by the United States Census Bureau: the six states of New England as well as New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. According to the National Congress of State Legislatures, none of these states need, or even request, an identity card with a photograph. (In fact, only one north-eastern state - Connecticut - requires any identity at all.) \"To the best of my knowledge, there is no North-East State with a photo identity as a condition,\" agreed Sean Green, Director of Research for the United States Pew Center, which follows voter identification legislation. There are certainly states close to the northeast with stricter rules. Delaware, Virginia and Ohio all need an identity. Michigan and Indiana are among the nine states throughout the country that require or require photo identities. \"Most of the pending bills this year are pictures of [states],\" said Boser, of the National Congress of State Legislatures. Among them are two states in New England, Min and New Hampshire. In the past, Connecticut was also considering the identification of images, but she has rejected the idea so far. In an attempt to portray Rhode Island as being remarkably isolated on this issue, the Union has overlooked some relevant facts: there are other states in the country that are increasingly becoming photographic identity card laws; most of the new draft laws under consideration throughout the country will require photo identity cards; and two Rhode Island neighbours in New England are considering such states. However, the European Civil Liberties Union is factually correct when it says that no other State in the north-east needs the identity of the image. That is why our judges (who, by the way, did not request their identities) voted to assess the claim of the World Federation of Freedoms (ACLU) that it is true.
