At a mid-October rally in Pennsylvania. Trump declared: \"Suburban women, will you please like me? Please. Please.\"\nAs part of an Oct. 25, 2020, segment on suburban women on WISN-TV\u2019s UpFront program, state Rep. Robyn Vining said this:\n\"We get a lot of calls from national press asking what\u2019s happening here so that they can try and understand what the shift is in the suburbs, but I think people are less likely to just vote for party now,\" said Vining, D-Wauwatosa. \"I really believe that they vote for people, so they\u2019re looking at the personalities who are running for office \u2014 who can they trust? It\u2019s not just who do I want to have a beer with now, it\u2019s also who can I trust, who can I trust to fight for me like they\u2019re fighting for their own family. And I think moms look at it that way.\"\nSo Vining was presumably asked about Trump\u2019s support in the suburbs \u2014 the TV clip doesn\u2019t show what exactly she was responding to \u2014 but her statement offers a broad assertion that voters in 2020 are considering personality more than they have in the past.\nLet\u2019s take a look.\nTrump\u2019s personality has an impact\nIf we interpret Vining\u2019s comment to narrowly address suburban women\u2019s response to Trump, there\u2019s a truth there.\n\"It is clear that their support for Trump actually has dropped off quite a lot,\" said Kenneth Mayer, professor of American politics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \"All of the data point to the fact that what is changing the attitudes of these voters is Trump, his sort of personality and operating style.\"\nA New York Times analysis by UCLA Professor Lynn Vavreck said polls show suburban white women are among the groups with the largest swings away from Trump in 2020 compared to 2016.\nMore people voting along party lines\nBut Vining\u2019s statement seems to make a broader claim about voters choosing based on personality, and \"the evidence does not support that,\" Mayer said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe frequency of ticket splitting \u2014 voters who support candidates from multiple parties on the same ballot \u2014 and the general polarization of the country show Americans are making party-based decisions now more than ever.\nAn analysis by FiveThirtyEight.com found ticket splitting hit an all-time low in 2018, the last time many states had an election offering voters a candidate from multiple parties in a statewide election (senator and governor, for instance).\nThe median difference between the margin of victory in the senate and gubernatorial races has regularly declined since at least 1998, hitting a low in 2018. In other words, voters are increasingly unlikely to vote for one party for senate and another for governor.\u00a0\nThat analysis concluded \"more voters are casting straight-ticket ballots. There are exceptions, of course, but this shift matches what we know about the larger electoral picture: voters are more partisan and the country is more divided than it\u2019s ever been in the modern era of U.S. politics.\"\nA Pew Research Center poll conducted Sept. 30 to Oct. 5 found only 4% of registered voters supported Trump or Democratic nominee Joe Biden and a U.S. Senate candidate from the opposing party.\nAnd Trump\u2019s approval rating offers further proof of the polarization, particularly when it comes to the president. The party split on his approval rating is the largest ever recorded by the Gallup poll, which goes back to President Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s.\nIn the Oct. 16-27, 2020, Gallup poll, 95% of Republicans approved of Trump\u2019s work in the White House, compared to 3% of Democrats \u2014 a 92-point gap. Before Trump, the largest gap recorded was a 77-point difference during President Barack Obama\u2019s last year in office.\nOur ruling\nVining said, \"People are less likely to just vote for party now. \u2026 They\u2019re looking at the personalities.\"\nLooking narrowly at Trump\u2019s support among suburban women, there\u2019s a case this is accurate. Trump\u2019s abrasive approach doesn\u2019t appear to be resonating with that group, and fewer appear likely to support him than in 2016.\nBut Vining\u2019s comment was more general than that. And broadly speaking, party is playing a growing role in voters\u2019 decisions \u2014 not a shrinking one.\nVoters are less likely than in the past to cast ballots supporting candidates from multiple parties. And they\u2019re more likely than ever to agree with people from their own party when assessing something like the president\u2019s job performance.\nWe rate this claim Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18423"}
