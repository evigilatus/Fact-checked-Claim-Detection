Companies are moving in. Car companies are moving into Michigan and to Ohio and to South Carolina and North Carolina \u2014 just today,\" Trump said during an NBC Town Hall.\nSo what is Trump talking about? Is a major auto plant or an auto manufacturer coming to North Carolina?\nNot that we could find.\u00a0\nSearching for evidence\nThe Washington Post looked into Trump\u2019s claims from Labor Day. The Center for Automotive Research couldn\u2019t substantiate Trump\u2019s statement for the Post, which gave his claim Four Pinocchios.\u00a0\nInside the state, North Carolina is known for pursuing automakers \u2014 and losing out to South Carolina, Georgia and Alabama.\nAs recently as Sept. 15, the Triangle Business Journal reported that North Carolina is still chasing its first full fledged car assembly plant. By TBJ\u2019s count, North Carolina missed out on ElectraMeccanica in September, as well as Toyota-Mazda, Peugeot, Volvo and Mercedes-Benz \u2014 all since 2015.\nWRAL TechWire reported that North Carolina\u2019s industrial leaders also recruited Tesla, which picked Texas earlier this year.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe trend has not gone unnoticed.\n\"We've wondered about why North Carolina gets onto finalist lists, only to come up short,\" Miami University professor James Rubenstein, a leading auto industry researcher, told PolitiFact for a separate story.\nTBJ reports that North Carolina is under consideration for an Indian SUV maker. However, that project is on hold amid the pandemic.\nWhat NC said\nPolitiFact North Carolina reached out to the state\u2019s Department of Commerce about Trump\u2019s claim.\n\"We have not recruited an assembly plant since 2017, although North Carolina offers several attractive sites for such a plant and we\u2019re actively in the hunt,\" David Rhoades, the department\u2019s communications director, said in an email.\nRhoades noted that truck maker Freightliner and school bus maker Thomas Built Buses, both part of Germany\u2019s Daimler AG, have locations in North Carolina that are considered automotive assembly operations. However, they predate Trump\u2019s administration.\u00a0\nAnd while North Carolina has not landed a major car company of late, Rhoades said the state has successfully recruited manufacturers of auto components.\u00a0\nHe provided a spreadsheet showing a total of 44 auto-related manufacturers that have expanded operations in North Carolina since 2019. In 2017, Tristone Flowtech announced 300 jobs in Iredell County and Triangle Tyre announced an 800-job expansion in Edgecombe County. Sonic Automotive announced 500 jobs in Gaston County in 2018, and Bharat Forge Aluminum announced 300 jobs in Lee County last year.\nStill, none of those projects live up to the size of Trump\u2019s claim. And neither the White House nor the Trump campaign responded to our requests for clarification.\nOur ruling\nPresident Trump recently said an auto \"company\" or an auto \"plant\" has opened or would be opening in North Carolina.\nThis claim stands out in a state that has aggressively pursued automakers, but has so far fallen short.\nThat\u2019s because it\u2019s not true. Trump\u2019s teams haven\u2019t backed up his claims. Fact checkers can\u2019t find evidence for them. And North Carolina\u2019s Department of Commerce isn\u2019t aware of any new, major automaker opening a plant in the state.\nWe rate this claim false.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18796"}
