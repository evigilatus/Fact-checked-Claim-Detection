The fake news must stop making excuses for something that is totally inexcusable,\" he tweeted. \"Sleepy Joe said he never spoke to the Ukrainian company, and then the picture came out where he was playing golf with the company boss and Hunter.\"\nThe photo, which was first aired by Fox News on Sept. 30, shows Joe and Hunter Biden playing golf in the Hamptons in 2014. According to Trump, one of the men is the \"company boss\" of Burisma, the energy company where Hunter served as a board member while his father was vice president. Trump tweeted a doctored Nickelback music video Oct. 2 that includes the image juxtaposed with an interview in which Joe Biden says he had never talked to his son about his business dealings abroad.\nThat video was quickly removed from both Twitter and YouTube due to a potential copyright infringement for the Nickelback music. But now Trump is re-upping the claim amid an ongoing impeachment inquiry against him for his own dealings with Ukraine.\nWe reached out to the White House for more information about the source of Trump\u2019s claim, but they did not comment on the record.\nTrump\u2019s tweet is misleading on two fronts.\n\u2022 The photo shows the Bidens with another American board member of Burisma.\n\u2022 Biden hasn\u2019t said whether or not he\u2019s spoken with Burisma officials.\nWho\u2019s really in the photo\nTrump claimed that the photo of the Bidens shows them posing \"with the company boss\" of Burisma. Our research shows otherwise.\nIn a previous story, we found that the man on the far left of the frame is Devon Archer. In 2008, Hunter Biden joined with Archer \u2014 a former senior adviser for the presidential campaign of John Kerry in 2004 \u2014 in a string of investment and consulting firms.\u00a0\nThe Wall Street Journal reported in May 2014 that the two had joined Burisma as board members. That role is different from \"boss\" or \"executive,\" as Trump has claimed in separate tweets about the photo of Archer. Board members are not typically involved in day-to-day operations of a company.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Joe Biden was vice president, firms run by his son and Archer \"pursued business with international entities that had a stake in American foreign policy decisions, sometimes in countries where connections implied political influence and protection,\" the New York Times reported in May.\nThe fourth man in the photo that Trump tweeted is Ralph Pascucci, founder of Netrex Capital Markets LLC, a New York investment banking firm. He is also a principal of Sebonack Golf Club in Southampton, N.Y., where the Bidens spent a week in August 2014.\n\n(Screenshots from Twitter and Netrex)\u00a0\nWe reached out to Joe Biden\u2019s presidential campaign for more details, but they did not comment on the record.\nTaras Burdeinyi is the current CEO of Burisma and Mykola Zlochevsky is the founder and owner. In 2014, Alan Apter was the chairman of the board of directors and reportedly brought on Biden and Archer.\nWhat Biden said\nIn his tweet, Trump claimed that Joe Biden said he \"never spoke to the Ukrainian company\" where his son served as a paid board member. But that mischaracterizes what the Democratic presidential candidate actually said.\nIn his Nickelback video, Trump showed a clip of Biden saying he had \"never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings,\" contrasting that with the photograph of the golf group. That\u2019s different than claiming he had never spoken to Burisma.\nRELATED STORY: Trump\u2019s Ukraine call, a whistleblower and the Bidens: What we know, what we don\u2019t\nBiden knew his son worked for the Ukrainian energy company. Beyond that, there\u2019s little we know.\nHunter Biden told the New Yorker magazine in July 2019 that he discussed Burisma with his father one time in December 2015. The Biden campaign says the discussion was not substantive.\nOur ruling\nTrump claimed Joe Biden \"said he never spoke to the Ukrainian company\" where his son, Hunter, served as a board member. He also claimed a photo of the Bidens shows them posing with \"the company boss\" of Burisma.\nThe photo that Trump is referencing doesn\u2019t show a Ukrainian executive of the company. It shows Devon Archer, a former board member and Hunter Biden\u2019s longtime business partner. Also, Biden never said he had never spoken to Burisma \u2014\u00a0he said he\u2019d never spoken to his son about his overseas business dealings. We could find no evidence that Biden ever made the former claim.\nTrump\u2019s statement is not accurate. We rate it False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00083"}
