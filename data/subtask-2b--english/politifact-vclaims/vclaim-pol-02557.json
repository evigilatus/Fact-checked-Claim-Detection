Dianne Feinstein of California:\n\"Virtually every Democrat has said there is no collusion. There is no collusion. .\u2009.\u2009. I saw Dianne Feinstein the other day\u00a0on television saying there is no collusion.\"\nFeinstein is the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee and a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, two of the three congressional panels investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election.\nSo, a statement from Feinstein declaring \"no collusion,\" would be significant.\nWas this another false claim or was there some truth to Trump\u2019s words?\nWe set out on a fact check.\nOur research\nA White House spokesman did not respond to our request for evidence backing up Trump\u2019s claim.\nThe president, however, was apparently referring to Feinstein\u2019s Nov. 5, 2017 interview with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper in which she discussed the Russia investigation but never flatly said there\u2019s no collusion. As NPR reported in a similar fact check, Feinstein\u2019s interview took place \"following the guilty plea of former Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos. Charging documents described conversations Papadopoulos had with Russian-linked individuals where he was promised \u2018dirt\u2019 on Hillary Clinton, as well as hacked emails.\"\nIn the CNN interview, Tapper asked Feinstein whether she had \"seen any evidence that this dirt, these emails, were ever given to the Trump campaign.\" Feinstein replied: \"Not so far.\"\n\nSen. Feinstein's interview on CNN\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 28, 2021 in a blog\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook tried to \u201cshut down\u201d the campaign to recall California Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Chris Nichols \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTapper then asked: \"Have you seen any communications that suggested that the Trump campaign wanted them to release them through a different means?\"\nFeinstein answered: \"I have not.\"\nThe senator\u2019s words were in response to a specific portion of the Russia investigation. They are not the same as saying \"there is no collusion.\"\nFeinstein spoke more generally about collusion during an Oct. 8, 2017 CBS interview, saying she did not know whether it had taken place.\n\"It's an open question because there's no proof yet that it's happened, and I think that proof will likely come with Mr. Mueller's investigation,\" Feinstein said referring to Special Counsel Robert Mueller.\nIn this case, again, Feinstein did not say there is no collusion.\nTom Mentzer, Feinstein\u2019s spokesman, said he was not aware of the senator ever making such a statement.\nFeinstein is running for re-election in 2018 and is being challenged by State Senate Leader Kevin de Le\u00f3n, also a Democrat.\nSimilar Trump claim\nIn May 2017, Trump made a similar mischaracterization. He tweeted that former U.S. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper \"and virtually everyone else\" said \"there is no collusion\" in the Russia investigation.\nPolitiFact National found Trump twisted Clapper\u2019s words from a March 2017 interview in which Clapper said he had no knowledge of improper contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian officials. In response to Trump\u2019s tweet, Clapper later said: \"I don\u2019t know if there was collusion or not,\" and that he did not believe the probe is \"a witch hunt.\" PolitiFact rated Trump\u2019s claim Mostly False.\nOur ruling\nPresident Trump recently claimed Sen. Feinstein said \"there is no collusion,\" between the Trump campaign and Russia.\nHe apparently based his statement on responses Feinstein gave in a November 2017 CNN interview about the Russia probe. While Feinstein said she had \"not so far\" seen specific evidence about one portion of the investigation, that\u2019s far from declaring there was no collusion. Speaking \u00a0more broadly about whether collusion took place, Feinstein said in an October 2017 interview that it's \"an open question.\" The president\u2019s claim distorted the senator\u2019s words and gave the wrong impression.\nWe rate\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim False.\n\nFALSE\u00a0\u2013\u00a0The statement is not accurate.\nClick here for\u00a0more\u00a0on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.\n Share the Facts 2018-01-03 02:08:04 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  Claimed Dianne Feinstein said \"there is no collusion\" between the Trump campaign and Russia.
