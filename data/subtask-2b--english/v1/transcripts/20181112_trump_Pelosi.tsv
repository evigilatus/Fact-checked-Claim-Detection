0001	TRUMP	Okay, thank you very much.
0002	TRUMP	It's a great honor to have Nancy Pelosi with us and Chuck Schumer with us.
0003	TRUMP	And we've actually worked very hard on a couple of things that are happening.
0004	TRUMP	Criminal justice reform  as you know, we've just heard word  got word that Mitch McConnell and the group, we're going to be putting it up for a vote.
0005	TRUMP	We have great Democrat support, great Republican support.
0006	TRUMP	So, criminal justice reform, something that people have been trying to get  how long, Nancy?
0007	TRUMP	Many years.
0008	PELOSI	A long time.
0009	TRUMP	Many, many years.
0010	TRUMP	Looks like it's going to be passing, hopefully  famous last words  on a very bipartisan way.
0011	TRUMP	And it's really something we're all very proud of.
0012	TRUMP	And again, tremendous support from Republicans and tremendous support from Democrats.
0013	TRUMP	And I think it's going to get a very good vote.
0014	TRUMP	And we'll see soon enough.
0015	TRUMP	But it will be up for a vote very shortly.
0016	TRUMP	A lot of years they've been waiting for it.
0017	TRUMP	The other thing, the farm bill is moving along nicely.
0018	TRUMP	And I guess they'll be voting on Friday or so.
0019	TRUMP	But pretty close.
0020	SCHUMER	Soon.
0021	SCHUMER	Soon.
0022	SYSTEM	(Inaudible.)
0023	TRUMP	And we think the farm bill is in very good shape.
0024	TRUMP	A lot of good things are happening with it, and our farmers are well taken care of.
0025	TRUMP	And again, that will be quite bipartisan and it will happen pretty soon.
0026	TRUMP	And then we have the easy one, the wall.
0027	TRUMP	That will be the one that will be the easiest of all.
0028	TRUMP	What do you think, Chuck?
0029	TRUMP	Maybe not?
0030	SCHUMER	It's called "funding the government," Mr. President.
0031	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0032	TRUMP	So we're going to see.
0033	TRUMP	But I will tell you, the wall will get built.
0034	TRUMP	We'll see what happens.
0035	TRUMP	It is not an easy situation because the Democrats have a different view, I think, than  I can say  the Republicans.
0036	TRUMP	We have great Republican support.
0037	TRUMP	We don't have Democrat support.
0038	TRUMP	But we're going to talk about that now.
0039	TRUMP	We're going to see.
0040	TRUMP	One thing that I do have to say is
0041	TRUMP	Tremendous amounts of wall have already been built, and a lot of  a lot of wall.
0042	TRUMP	When you include the renovation of existing fences and walls, we've renovated a tremendous amount and we've done a lot of work.
0043	TRUMP	In San Diego, we're building new walls right now.
0044	TRUMP	And we've  right next to San Diego, we've completed a major section of wall and it's really worked well.
0045	TRUMP	So, a lot of wall has been built.
0046	TRUMP	We don't talk about that, but we might as well start, because it's building  it's being built right now, big sections of wall.
0047	TRUMP	And we will continue that.
0048	TRUMP	And one way or the other, it's going to get built.
0049	TRUMP	I'd like not to see a government closing, a shutdown.
0050	TRUMP	We will see what happens over the next short period of time.
0051	TRUMP	But the wall is a very important thing to us.
0052	TRUMP	I might put it a different way.
0053	TRUMP	Border security is extremely important, and we have to take care of border security.
0054	TRUMP	When you look at what happened with the caravans, with the people, with a lot of  we shut it down we had no choice.
0055	TRUMP	We shut it down.
0056	TRUMP	But it could be a lot easier if we had real border security.
0057	TRUMP	I just want to pay my respects to the Border Patrol agents and officers.
0058	TRUMP	They've been incredible.
0059	TRUMP	The ICE agents and officers, they've been incredible.
0060	TRUMP	And very importantly, our military.
0061	TRUMP	Our military went in and they did an incredible job.
0062	TRUMP	They have been really, really spectacular.
0063	TRUMP	A lot of the people that wanted to come into the country, and really, they were to come in no matter how they wanted to come in  they were going to come in even in a rough way  many of these people are leaving now and they're going back to their countries Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, and other countries.
0064	TRUMP	They're leaving.
0065	TRUMP	If you noticed, it's getting a lot less crowded in Mexico.
0066	TRUMP	And a lot of them are going to stay in Mexico, and the Mexican government has been working with us very well.
0067	TRUMP	So we appreciate that.
0068	TRUMP	But they haven't been coming into our country.
0069	TRUMP	We can't let people come in that way.
0070	TRUMP	So that's pretty much it.
0071	TRUMP	We're going to talk about the wall.
0072	TRUMP	I wanted to talk about criminal justice reform, just to let you know how positive that is.
0073	TRUMP	I want to talk about the farm bill, how positive that is.
0074	TRUMP	And I want to talk about the wall.
0075	TRUMP	And I will tell you, it's a tough issue because we are in very opposite sides of  I really think I can say "border security," but certainly the wall.
0076	TRUMP	But the wall will get built.
0077	TRUMP	A lot of the wall is built.
0078	TRUMP	It's been very effective.
0079	TRUMP	I asked for a couple of notes on that.
0080	TRUMP	If you look at San Diego, illegal traffic dropped 92 percent once the wall was up.
0081	TRUMP	El Paso, illegal traffic dropped 72 percent, then ultimately 95 percent, once the wall was up.
0082	TRUMP	In Tucson, Arizona, illegal traffic dropped 92 percent.
0083	TRUMP	Yuma, it dropped illegal traffic 95 to 96 percent.
0084	TRUMP	I mean  and when I say "dropped," the only reason we even have any percentage where people got through is because they walk and go around areas that aren't built.
0085	TRUMP	It dropped virtually 100 percent in the areas where the wall is.
0086	TRUMP	So, I mean, it's very effective.
0087	TRUMP	If you really want to find out how effective a wall is, just ask Israel  99.9 percent effective.
0088	TRUMP	And our wall will be every bit as good as that, if not better.
0089	TRUMP	So we've done a lot of work on the wall a lot of wall is built.
0090	TRUMP	A lot of people don't know that.
0091	TRUMP	A lot of wall is renovated.
0092	TRUMP	We have walls that were in very bad condition that are now in A1 tiptop shape.
0093	TRUMP	And, frankly, some wall has been reinforced by our military.
0094	TRUMP	Our military has done a fantastic job.
0095	TRUMP	So the wall will get built, but we may not  we may not have an agreement today.
0096	TRUMP	We probably won't.
0097	TRUMP	But we have an agreement on other things that are really good.
0098	TRUMP	Nancy, would you like to say something?
0099	PELOSI	Well, thank you, Mr. President, for the opportunity to meet with you so that we can work together in a bipartisan way to meet the needs of the American people.
0100	PELOSI	I think the American people recognize that we must keep government open, that a shutdown is not worth anything, and that you should not have a Trump shutdown.
0101	PELOSI	You have the White House 
0102	TRUMP	Did you say "Trump"  oh, oh.
0103	PELOSI	A "Trump shutdown."
0104	PELOSI	You have the White House 
0105	TRUMP	I was going to call it a "Pelosi shutdown."
0106	PELOSI	You have the Senate.
0107	PELOSI	You have the House of Representatives.
0108	PELOSI	You have the votes.
0109	PELOSI	You should pass it right now.
0110	TRUMP	No, we don't have the votes, Nancy, because in the Senate, we need 60 votes and we don't have it.
0111	PELOSI	No, no, but in the House, you could bring it up right now, today.
0112	TRUMP	Yeah, but I can't  excuse me.
0113	TRUMP	But I can't get it passed in the House if it's not going to pass in the Senate.
0114	TRUMP	I don't want to waste time.
0115	PELOSI	Well, the fact is you can get it started that way.
0116	TRUMP	The House we can get passed very easily, and we do.
0117	PELOSI	Okay, then do it.
0118	PELOSI	Then do it.
0119	TRUMP	But the problem is the Senate, because we need 10 Democrats to vote, and they won't vote.
0120	PELOSI	No, no, that's not the point, Mr. President.
0121	PELOSI	The point is 
0122	TRUMP	It's sort of the point.
0123	PELOSI	 that there are equities to be weighed.
0124	PELOSI	And we are here to have a conversation 
0125	TRUMP	Correct.
0126	PELOSI	 in a careful way.
0127	PELOSI	So I don't think we should have a debate in front of the press on this.
0128	PELOSI	But the fact is, the House Republicans could bring up this bill, if they had the votes, immediately, and set the tone for what you want.
0129	TRUMP	If we thought we were going to get it passed in the Senate, Nancy, we would do it immediately.
0130	TRUMP	We would get it passed very easily in the House.
0131	PELOSI	No, that's not the point.
0132	PELOSI	That's not the point.
0133	TRUMP	Nancy, I'd have it passed in two seconds.
0134	TRUMP	It doesn't matter, though, because we can't get it passed in the Senate because we need 10 Democrat votes.
0135	TRUMP	That's the problem.
0136	PELOSI	Well, again, let us have our conversation 
0137	TRUMP	That's right.
0138	PELOSI	 and then we can meet with the press again.
0139	PELOSI	But the fact is, is that legislating  which is what we do 
0140	TRUMP	Right.
0141	PELOSI	 you begin, you make your point, you state your case.
0142	PELOSI	That's what the House Republicans could do, if they had the votes.
0143	PELOSI	But there are no votes in the House, a majority of votes, for a wall  no matter where you start.
0144	SCHUMER	That is exactly right.
0145	SCHUMER	You don't have the votes in the House.
0146	TRUMP	If I needed the votes for the wall in the House, I would have them  in one session, it would be done.
0147	PELOSI	Well, then go do it.
0148	PELOSI	Go do it.
0149	TRUMP	It doesn't help because we need 10 Democrats in the Senate.
0150	PELOSI	No, don't put it on the Senate.
0151	PELOSI	Put it on the negotiation.
0152	TRUMP	Okay, let me ask you this.
0153	TRUMP	Just  and we're doing this in a very friendly manner.
0154	TRUMP	It doesn't help for me to take a vote in the House, where I will win easily with the Republicans 
0155	PELOSI	You will not win.
0156	TRUMP	It doesn't help to take that vote because I'm not going to get the vote of the Senate.
0157	PELOSI	Well, don't blame it on the Senate, Mr. President.
0158	TRUMP	I need 10 senators.
0159	TRUMP	That's the problem.
0160	PELOSI	Mr. President, you have the White House, you have the Senate.
0161	TRUMP	I have the White House.
0162	PELOSI	You have the House of Representatives.
0163	TRUMP	The White House is done.
0164	TRUMP	And the House would give me the vote if I wanted it.
0165	TRUMP	But I can't because I need 
0166	PELOSI	But you can't  you can't 
0167	TRUMP	Nancy, I need 10 votes from Chuck.
0168	SCHUMER	All right, let me say something here.
0169	PELOSI	Mr. President, let me  let me just say one thing.
0170	PELOSI	The fact is you do not have the votes in the House.
0171	TRUMP	Nancy, I do.
0172	TRUMP	And we need border security.
0173	PELOSI	Well, let's take the vote and we'll find out.
0174	TRUMP	Nancy.
0175	TRUMP	Nancy.
0176	TRUMP	We need border security.
0177	TRUMP	It's very simple.
0178	PELOSI	Of course we do.
0179	TRUMP	We need border security.
0180	PELOSI	We do.
0181	TRUMP	People are pouring into our country, including terrorists.
0182	TRUMP	We have terrorists.
0183	TRUMP	We caught 10 terrorists over the last very short period of time.
0184	TRUMP	Ten.
0185	TRUMP	These are very serious people.
0186	TRUMP	Our border agents, all of our law enforcement has been incredible what they've done.
0187	TRUMP	But we caught 10 terrorists.
0188	TRUMP	These are people that were looking to do harm.
0189	TRUMP	We need the wall.
0190	TRUMP	We need  more important than anything, we need border security, of which the wall is just a piece.
0191	TRUMP	But it's important.
0192	TRUMP	Chuck, did you want to say something?
0193	SCHUMER	Yeah.
0194	SCHUMER	Here's what I want to say
0195	SCHUMER	We have a lot of disagreements here.
0196	SCHUMER	The Washington Post today gave you a whole lot of Pinocchios because they say you constantly misstate how much the wall is  how much of the wall is built and how much is there.
0197	SCHUMER	But that's not the point here.
0198	SCHUMER	We have a disagreement about the wall 
0199	TRUMP	Well, the Washington Post 
0200	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0201	SCHUMER	 whether it's effective or it isn't.
0202	SCHUMER	Not on border security, but on the wall.
0203	SCHUMER	We do not want to shut down the government.
0204	SCHUMER	You have called 20 times to shut down the government.
0205	SCHUMER	You say, "I want to shut down the government."
0206	SCHUMER	We don't.
0207	SCHUMER	We want to come to an agreement.
0208	SCHUMER	If we can't come to an agreement, we have solutions that will pass the House and Senate right now, and will not shut down the government.
0209	SCHUMER	And that's what we're urging you to do.
0210	SCHUMER	Not threaten to shut down the government 
0211	TRUMP	Chuck 
0212	SCHUMER	 because you 
0213	TRUMP	You don't want to shut down the government, Chuck.
0214	SCHUMER	Let me just finish.
0215	SCHUMER	Because you can't get your way.
0216	TRUMP	Because the last time you shut it down you got killed.
0217	SCHUMER	Yeah.
0218	SCHUMER	Let me say something, Mr. President.
0219	SCHUMER	You just say, "My way, or we'll shut down the government."
0220	SCHUMER	We have a proposal that Democrats and Republicans will support to do a CR that will not shut down the government.
0221	SCHUMER	We urge you to take it.
0222	TRUMP	And if it's not good border security, I won't take it.
0223	PELOSI	It is good border security.
0224	SCHUMER	It is very good border security.
0225	TRUMP	And if it's not good border security, I won't take it.
0226	PELOSI	It's actually what the border security asked for.
0227	SCHUMER	It's what the border 
0228	TRUMP	Because when you look at these numbers of the effectiveness of our border security, and when you look at the job that we're doing with our military 
0229	SCHUMER	You just said it is effective.
0230	TRUMP	Can I be  can I tell you something?
0231	SCHUMER	Yeah, you just said it's effective.
0232	TRUMP	Without a wall  these are only areas where you have the walls.
0233	SCHUMER	We want to do this 
0234	TRUMP	Where you have walls, Chuck, it's effective.
0235	TRUMP	Where you don't have walls, it is not effective.
0236	PELOSI	Wait a second.
0237	PELOSI	Let's call a halt to this.
0238	SCHUMER	Yeah.
0239	PELOSI	Let's call a halt to this.
0240	PELOSI	We've come in here as the first branch of government Article I, the legislative branch.
0241	PELOSI	We're coming in, in good faith, to negotiate with you about how we can keep the government open.
0242	SCHUMER	Open.
0243	TRUMP	We're going to keep it open 
0244	PELOSI	The American 
0245	TRUMP	 if we have border security.
0246	PELOSI	The American 
0247	TRUMP	If we don't have border security, Chuck 
0248	PELOSI	I'm with you.
0249	TRUMP	 we're not going to keep it open.
0250	PELOSI	I'm with you.
0251	PELOSI	We are going to have border security.
0252	SCHUMER	And it's the same border 
0253	PELOSI	Effective border security.
0254	SCHUMER	You're bragging about what has been done.
0255	TRUMP	By us.
0256	SCHUMER	We want to do the same thing we did last year, this year.
0257	SCHUMER	That's our proposal.
0258	SCHUMER	If it's good then, it's good now, and it won't shut down the government.
0259	TRUMP	Chuck, we can build a much bigger section with more money.
0260	SCHUMER	Let's debate 
0261	PELOSI	We have taken 
0262	SCHUMER	Let's debate in private.
0263	PELOSI	We have taken this conversation 
0264	SCHUMER	Okay?
0265	TRUMP	Okay.
0266	SCHUMER	Yeah.
0267	PELOSI	 to a place that is devoid, frankly, of fact.
0268	PELOSI	And we can dispel that.
0269	TRUMP	We need border security.
0270	TRUMP	And I think we all agree that we need border security.
0271	SCHUMER	Yes, we do.
0272	TRUMP	Is that right?
0273	SCHUMER	We do.
0274	TRUMP	See?
0275	TRUMP	We get along.
0276	TRUMP	Thank you, everybody.
0277	SYSTEM	(Inaudible)
0278	QUESTION	Mr. President.
0279	QUESTION	You say border security and the wall.
0280	QUESTION	Can you have border security without the wall?
0281	QUESTION	There's a commonality on border security.
0282	TRUMP	No, you need the wall.
0283	TRUMP	The wall is a part of border security.
0284	QUESTION	Are you redefining what it means to have border security?
0285	SCHUMER	Yes.
0286	TRUMP	Yeah.
0287	TRUMP	We need border security.
0288	TRUMP	The wall is a part of border security.
0289	TRUMP	You can't have very good border security without the wall, no.
0290	PELOSI	That's simply not true.
0291	PELOSI	That is a political promise.
0292	PELOSI	Border security is a way to effectively honor our responsibilities.
0293	SCHUMER	And the experts say you can do border security without a wall, which is wasteful and doesn't solve the problem.
0294	TRUMP	It totally solves the problem.
0295	PELOSI	Again, but I don't want to take this 
0296	TRUMP	And it's very important.
0297	PELOSI	Unfortunately, this has spiraled downward from  we came at a place to say, "How do we meet the needs of American people who have needs?"
0298	PELOSI	The economy has  people are losing their jobs.
0299	PELOSI	The market is in a mood.
0300	PELOSI	Our members are already (inaudible).
0301	TRUMP	Well, we have the lowest unemployment that we've had in 50 years.
0302	PELOSI	Sixty people of the Republican Party have lost  are losing their offices now because of the transition.
0303	PELOSI	People are not  the morale is not 
0304	TRUMP	And we've gained in the Senate.
0305	TRUMP	Nancy, we've gained in the Senate.
0306	PELOSI	The morale 
0307	TRUMP	Excuse me.
0308	TRUMP	Did we win the Senate?
0309	PELOSI	 is not (inaudible).
0310	TRUMP	We won the Senate.
0311	PELOSI	When the President brags that he won North Dakota and Indiana, he's in real trouble.
0312	TRUMP	I did.
0313	PELOSI	Let me say this.
0314	TRUMP	We did win North Dakota.
0315	PELOSI	This is the most unfortunate thing.
0316	PELOSI	We came in here in good faith, and we are entering into this kind of a discussion in the public view.
0317	TRUMP	But it's not bad, Nancy.
0318	PELOSI	Let us  no, but it's 
0319	TRUMP	It's called transparency.
0320	PELOSI	I know.
0321	PELOSI	But it's not transparency when we're not stipulating to a set of facts.
0322	PELOSI	And when we wanted to have a debate with you about saying we'd confront some of these facts  
0323	TRUMP	You know what?
0324	TRUMP	We need border security.
0325	PELOSI	 without saying to the public, "This isn't true."
0326	TRUMP	That's what we're going to be talking about border security.
0327	TRUMP	If we don't have border security, we'll shut down the government.
0328	TRUMP	This country needs border security.
0329	PELOSI	We agree with that.
0330	TRUMP	The wall is a part of border security.
0331	SYSTEM	(Inaudible.)
0332	TRUMP	Let's have a talk.
0333	TRUMP	We're going to get the wall built and we've done a lot of wall already.
0334	QUESTION	Mr. President, how big a part of border security is the wall?
0335	QUESTION	Is that the 
0336	TRUMP	It's a big section.
0337	TRUMP	It's a big part of it.
0338	QUESTION	Is it everything that you need?
0339	TRUMP	It's a big part of it.
0340	TRUMP	We need to have effective border security.
0341	TRUMP	We need a wall in certain parts  no, not in all parts  but in certain parts of a 2,000mile border, we need a wall.
0342	QUESTION	How much money, Mr. President?
0343	TRUMP	We are doing it much under budget.
0344	TRUMP	We're actually way under 
0345	QUESTION	(Inaudible) this conversation.
0346	TRUMP	 budget on the areas that we've renovated and areas that we've built.
0347	TRUMP	I would say if we got 
0348	QUESTION	Do you still need the 
0349	TRUMP	 if we got $5 billion, we could do a tremendous chunk of wall.
0350	QUESTION	Is that mandatory?
0351	QUESTION	Would you accept less though?
0352	QUESTION	And are your guests conversely willing to offer more?
0353	TRUMP	Well, we're going to see.
0354	TRUMP	We're going to see.
0355	TRUMP	Look, we have to have the wall.
0356	TRUMP	This isn't a question this is a national emergency.
0357	TRUMP	Drugs are pouring into our country.
0358	TRUMP	People with tremendous medical difficulty and medical problems are pouring in, and in many  in many cases, it's contagious.
0359	TRUMP	They're pouring into our country.
0360	TRUMP	We have to have border security.
0361	TRUMP	We have to have a wall as part of border security.
0362	TRUMP	And I don't think we really disagree so much.
0363	TRUMP	I also know that, you know, Nancy is in a situation where it's not easy for her to talk right now, and I understand that.
0364	TRUMP	And I fully understand that.
0365	TRUMP	We're going to have a good discussion and we're going to see what happens.
0366	PELOSI	Mr. President

0410	SCHUMER	We disagree.
