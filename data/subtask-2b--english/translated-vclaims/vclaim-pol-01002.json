U.S. funding abortions abroad.", "text": "On 3 January 2019, the House of Representatives - under new democratic control - passed a bill in an attempt to reopen government departments affected by partial closure. In the end, this bill did not go anywhere, and closure was resolved differently. But we wanted to go back to that law and claim by the U.S. Republic of Glen Grothman, R-Glenbeulah. His point of view: Democratic leaders have introduced United States funding for abortions abroad into the bill. \"Not even 24 hours at the new congressional and Democrat session voting to send our taxes abroad to finance abortion,\" Jan 4, 2019. In a statement issued on January 15, 2019, the Democrats opened the new conference, on the first day, by including a hidden provision in H.R. 21 that will turn (the protection of life in global health assistance) and allow billions of dollars of aid that we send to other countries for use in abortion.\" Is it true (Gruthman) that a provision in the first draft law approved by Democrats at home \"will allow billions of dollars of aid that we send to other countries for abortion\"? Not exactly. When we requested support for the claim, the spokesman for Grotman Timothy Svoboda cited the text of the bill and pointed out that he \"was sponsored by Nita Louis and placed by the democratic leadership in the Hall - and thus by 'Democrats'. 1021-1022 The organization requires foreign non-governmental organizations, as a condition for receiving Global Health Assistance Grant funds, to agree not to perform or actively promote abortion as a method of family planning. This policy, reaffirmed and updated by President Trump, is now applicable to all (approximately) global health programmes. $8.8 billion based on funding levels for global health assistance for fiscal year 17). If NGOs choose to stop performing abortions, they can continue to qualify for federal grant funds. The choice was left to the NGO - either to change business practices or to abandon funding from the United States.\" On the roof, it looks like Grothman's right. But there's more to it than that. The programme in question has been part of federal policy for decades, with policy often changing among presidents. In 1984, President Ronald Reagan announced Mexico City's \"Policy\" after the United Nations Conference on World Population. The critics called it \"the global gag rule.\" Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" \"What politics does is require foreign non-governmental organizations that receive health assistance from the United States Government to certify that they do not use United States funds or other funds to do many things,\" said Emily Masterless, a senior programme officer of the Global Health Justice and Governance Programme at the Mayleman School of Public Health of Columbia University. \"One is the provision of abortion as a method of family planning. Another thing is counselling and referring women to abortion in a context where abortion is legal.\" Nor can organizations defend or press for the continued legality of abortion in their country. This policy does not apply to cases of rape or incest or if the birth endangers the life of the mother. This policy was abolished by President Bill Clinton in 1993, claiming that it undermined efforts to promote safe family planning abroad. President George W. Bush gave it back. Then President Barack Obama canceled it. In 2017, President Donald Trump returned to office - but he went further. It expanded it under a new name: protecting life in global health assistance. The original version applied to the funding of family planning programmes. \"The policy in its expanded version applies to any global health financing,\" said Masterless. \"Explored in terms of dollar amount. It has expanded in terms of potential areas of health and non-governmental organizations (foreign) that will be affected.\" So, the barriers to financing abortions, did the home Democrats manage them, and they deactivated the new policy, does that mean that US aid funds could go to finance abortions? No. Before Mexico City's policy, there was a budget adjustment enacted in 1973 stating that \"foreign assistance funds may not be used to pay for performing abortion as a means of family planning or to induce or force anyone to have an abortion.\" The so-called \"Hilms Amendment\" was named for the American late Sun Jesse Helms, R-North Carolina. This remains in place, and according to Masterless, it is \"exactly applied\" by federal agencies. If so, why have Mexico City's policy been developed and reversed so many times over the years? This is about wrinkling in how it's applied. Before Mexico City's policy, United States aid recipients could use funds other than the United States to engage in abortion-related activities, but they had to keep them separate from American aid funds. Thus, when the policy is not in force, countries engaged in abortion-related activities still have access to family planning funds in the United States. They can't mix the pots together. When such a policy exists, if foreign non-governmental organizations want any family planning funds from the United States, they cannot use any other funding for abortion-related activities. At the same time, under the expanded Trump policy, any health funding from the United States - not just family planning funds - is affected in this way. This is the policy in force today. Our assessment of Grothman claimed that in a draft law supported by Democrats in House, \"billions of dollars of assistance we send to other countries for use in abortions are allowed.\" A portion of the language in the bill would have extended a long period of work on Mexico City policy. But the so-called Helms amendment would have remained. Therefore, United States tax dollars cannot be used to finance abortions abroad. We're appreciating Grothman's false claim.
