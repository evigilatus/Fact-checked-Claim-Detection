It must be election season.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nOne advertisement that caught our attention was a claim by District 27 state Senate candidate Kevin Rader against his Republican opponent Lizbeth Benacquisto.\u00a0\n\nRader beat Democratic opponent Pete Burkert by about 1,000 votes in the Aug. 24, 2010, primary election. Rader and Benacquisto are vying for the seat vacated by Dave Aronberg, who lost the Democratic primary for attorney general in August. The district runs from Republican-heavy Lee County through rural Glades and Hendry counties and into Democratic-heavy Palm Beach County.\u00a0\n\nDuring a recent television ad, Rader attacks Benacquisto for 105 Florida election law violations. The advertisement, which features a picture of Benacquisto and mathematical symbols and equations, includes this:\u00a0\n\n\"Let\u2019s do the math on Lizbeth Benacquisto. She broke election law 105 times, hiding special interest contributors. She claims she\u2019s a tax cutter, but on city council, she repeatedly raised taxes and fees, totaling a 52 percent tax increase. One hundred five ethics violations; 52 percent tax increase. We can\u2019t afford Lizbeth Benacquisto, or believe her.\"\u00a0\n\nThat seems like a large number of violations, so we wanted to put Rader\u2019s claim to the Truth-O-Meter test.\u00a0\n\nThe source for the ad is a Palm Beach Post article published April 9, 2006, and written by Dwayne Robinson.\u00a0\n\nThe article focuses on Wellington village council members and their myriad mistakes in campaign record filings during the March 14, 2006, municipal election in Palm Beach County. Benacquisto was elected vice mayor with more than 56 percent of the vote over challengers Julio Galvez and Jean Lexima.\u00a0\n\nThe Rader ad focuses on an allegation against Benacquisto that in more than 105 instances, her reports excluded the occupations of donors giving more than $100 to her campaign. The article states many of those donors \"were developers, builders, Big Sugar and other special interests.\"\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi bought $1.25 million in Tesla stock the day before Joe Biden signed an order \u201cfor all federal vehicles\u201d to be electric.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlorida law requires each report to contain the full name, address and occupation of anyone who has made a contribution, along with amount and date of such contribution.\n\nMercedes Kelly, then Benacquisto\u2019s campaign treasurer, told the Post she started including contributors\u2019 occupations at the beginning of the campaign, but trailed off as the money came in. She admitted to being overwhelmed and said she would be filing an addendum with the complete information.\n\nAccording to 2006 campaign finance reports, Benacquisto filed addendums, writing by hand each person\u2019s occupation for two filing periods, January through mid February and mid February through March. There were indeed builders and farmers, but also housewives, retirees and veterinarians.\u00a0\n\nThis was a situation where the same error was made 105 times, not 105 different types of errors. Still, Benacquisto had 108 contributors for 2006, so missing occupations on 105 of them meant nearly all her donors were not listed correctly.\n\nFor a third filing period, in 2005\u00a0but part of the same election cycle, no addendum was filed. In that 2005 period, occupations weren\u2019t listed for 53 of the 78 contributors.\u00a0\n\nThe 2006 article points out that during a 2002 village election, Benacquisto had no election law errors and fully reported donors\u2019 occupations. Since the municipal election was four years ago and the omissions were publicized, we were curious how Benacquisto was doing this time. We looked at her filings for the 2010 Senate race. We found that of 673 contributions to Benacquisto so far this year, 150 times the occupation isn\u2019t listed, according to information on the Florida Division of Elections website.\u00a0\n\nIn fairness, we\u2019ll note that in\u00a0Rader\u2019s last report, for the period of Sept. 25 through Oct. 8, he also fails to list occupation 14 times among the 104 donors, according to the state Division of Elections website.\n\nFlorida Election Commission Clerk Patsy Rushing said on Oct. 21 that no complaints have been filed against Benacquisto in this race.\u00a0\n\nWe\u2019ll leave it up to you to determine whether there\u2019s intent to leave off contributors\u2019 names or just sloppiness by the campaign.\u00a0\n\nBut as for the truth of the matter, we rate Rader\u2019s claim that Benacquisto \"broke election law 105 times\" as True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-14162"}
