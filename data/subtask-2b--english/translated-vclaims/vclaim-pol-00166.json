All these points are not accurate. Her campaign crew told us Warren was just meant to check her background. Less than 50 senators supported the offensive arms embargo. In April 2013, a few months after Sandy Hawk was shot, legislators voted on several arms control measures. They all failed. Sin Joe Manchen, a West Virginia Democrat, met with Sen Republican Pennsylvania, Bat Tommy on legislation, which became known as the Manchine-Tommy Amendment. The amendment called for the extension of cheques to include offers of arms and the sale of the Internet, but did not require family and friends to give or sell arms to each other. It was seen as a compromise to replace a more stringent measure than the leader of the majority, Harry Reed. The compromise amendment is still largely a partial vote, when 54 to 46 were defeated. In procedural terms, the amendment requires 60 votes for approval. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 11 January 2021, the same day, the offensive arms embargo by Sen failed. Fifteen members of its Democratic Party (in addition to one independent member) voted against the ban. At that time, the Democrats held 53 seats in the Senate, and two independent members were brought together with the Democrats, and 45 senators were Republicans. A spokesman for Warren said that her reference to 54 votes was for the Manchen-Tommy amendment. In an intermediate article in August, Warren wrote that the Senate voted against the offensive arms embargo and \"rejection of the background verification proposal, despite 54 senators from both parties voting in favour of it, These were the minimum steps we needed to take. Six years later, Congress still hasn't done anything.\" Our referee Warren said, \"54 senators said, let's check our background, let's get rid of the assault weapons, let's get rid of the attack weapons. Warren was referring to the vote on arms control legislation on April 17, 2013. The background check adjustment failed when 54 senators voted in favour of him, without the 60 votes necessary to break a shaky threat. However, the vote on the offensive arms embargo failed by only 40 votes. We're assessing this statement half right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00166"}
