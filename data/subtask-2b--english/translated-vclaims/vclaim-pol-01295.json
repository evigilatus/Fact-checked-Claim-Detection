In an interview with Sean Hannetti on October 30, 2018, Desantes doubled his claim that Gillum is a law enforcement. \"There's no doubt corruption in Talahasi,\" said Desantes. \"It's one of the most corrupt cities in Florida. It also has the highest crime rate in Florida. This is the man who took the pledge to attack our men and women in law enforcement. He's not gonna set them up.\" A few moments later, Huntie said he read that Gillum is not a big fan of the police. Desantis replied, \"The police and prisons have no place in justice. It's outrageous.\" Guillaume is the democratic candidate for the Governor of Florida and the Mayor of Talahasi. He is facing Desantes, a former congressman supported by President Donald Trump. We have considered the allegations of Desantes and Gilom regarding the crime rate in Talahasi as well as the attacks on Gilom about the FBI investigation. Gillum never said \"police and prisons have no place in justice.\" When asked what their evidence was, the DiSantis campaign referred to Gilom's relationship with the Dream Advocates Group. We'll explain the connection, but Gillum never said those words. Desantis' pledge often refers to the group of defenders of the dream of social justice, a group that has raised concerns about racial profiling since the death of Travon Martin in 2012, the unarmed African-American youth shot by a neighborhood watcher in Sanford, not. Gilom's support for dream defenders is due to the formation of the group, although Dream Defenders and Gilom said that they did not share each other's programs. A spokesman for Gilom told the Miami Herald newspaper in late September that dream advocates were leaders of the struggle for social justice in Florida, but Gilom did not agree with many of the group &apos; s positions. Naela Summers, speaking on behalf of the Dream Defenders, agreed with the Herald that the Dream Defenders are \"more left\" than Gilom, and that they disagree on topics including the role of the police and prisons, the functioning of the border, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. When Desantes said that Gillum had signed an undertaking to attack law enforcement, he was referring to the commitment of elected officials to the Liberty Paper. This pledge is a two-page document that calls for those who sign it to undertake not to take a penny from the National Broadcasting Agency or the Geographic Group, a private company operating in the prison. \"I will fight for Florida, which disposes of prisons, detention centres, weapons and police and invests in the basic needs and safety of its people, especially its children,\" this pledge. \"I will strive to reallocate our government budget from police and prisons to good food, affordable housing, good health care and public education.\" On January 12, 2021, he wrote in an Instagram article saying that Joe Biden remained silent about the violence in Black Lives-Mite protests. By Tom Kircher: January 16, 2021, Gillum signed the pledge in June 2018, along with the other three candidates for the office of Democratic Governor at the time, according to the spokesman for Dream Defender Naela Summers. The candidates signed the pledge after a discussion co-hosted by Dream Defenders. Summers said that 30 politicians in Florida signed the pledge. The elected officials pledged the papers of liberty to a different document from the papers of liberty, which is a longer document summarizing the views of the defenders of dreams in more detail. However, two-page elected officials have pledged the line, \"I pledge my support for the papers of liberty.\" The Freedom Papers are a 20-page document producing a series of data on social and economic issues, particularly those affecting the poor, minorities and migrants. These papers raise concerns about teacher pay shortages, income inequality, high rental rates, advocacy for open elections and an end to violence. The Freedom Papers document contains a few paragraphs that are highly critical of the police and prisons and extend to the days when the police have helped to arrest deserted slaves. \"Police and prisons have no place in \"justice\" this document is longer. \"Police and prisons are not only racist, but they work to separate the rich from the poor. True safety cannot be found in a place that was never meant to be.\" The newspapers also state that prisons separate rich from poor. \"We deserve real safety over our cities, our states, our homes, our schools, our workplaces, our community centers,\" Gilom's relationship with the police as Mayor of Gilom has called for criminal justice reform, but his record shows that he wants to work with law enforcement agencies. In 2014, the democratic opinion of Talahasi, Gilom, spoke of a tour along gold with the Talahasi police and appealed to members of the community for their support. \"For the sake of my children and yours, and I hope you will join me in supporting our law enforcement officers and investing your time and talents to improve our society,\" Gillum wrote at the time. During Gilom's tenure as mayor, Talahasi added more than 50 police officers. Tallahassee began several law enforcement-related programmes that focused on strengthening relations between the community and the police and on improving rates of reoffending while Gilom was mayor and earlier when he was delegated to the city. Our judgment (Gelum) signed the pledge of elected officials to defend dreams, but we found no evidence to say: \"Police and prisons have no place in justice.\" This is the line of the longer document for the defenders of dreams, the papers of freedom. The commitment signed by Gilom focuses on the abandonment of prisons, weapons and police and the placement of funds in safety and education. The signatories also agree not to take money from the National Army of the Republic or from a special group of prisoners. The longer document, Freedom Papers, expands the views of dream advocates through 20 pages of data on a range of social and economic issues. ....................................................................................................... However, Gilom and Dream Defenders assert that they do not see eye to eye on many issues and that the Dream Defenders are \"more left\" than Gilom. We're assessing this mostly wrong.
