So we tuned out the dramatic flourish and got to work checking out the claim.\n\nThe vote Cicilline's ad talks about was on a 2005 bill in the Rhode Island General Assembly -- now a law -- that allows judges to require those subject to permanent domestic violence restraining orders to surrender their firearms.\n\nRhode Island was the 41st state to enact this law, as part of a push by domestic violence advocates to protect victims.\n\nAfter multiple amendments that carved out exemptions for police officers and active duty military personnel to keep their service weapons while on duty, the Rhode Island bill made it to the floor in June 2005.\n\nOnce there, it underwent several more changes, one of them spearheaded by Loughlin, a representative from Tiverton,\u00a0 who successfully advocated to exempt on-duty National Guard members from the provision as well.\n\nThe House bill passed in a 46-20 vote on June 22, 2005, with Loughlin voting no. The Senate approved the same legislation days later and the bill was signed into law in early July.\n\nThe problem with the Cicilline advertisement's claim is that it incorrectly says the bill applies to those \"accused of domestic violence.\" A restraining order is actually a civil document that can be obtained without accusing the subject of a specific crime.\n\n\"It may be to prevent something from happening,\" explained Deb DeBare, executive director of the Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence. \"[The victim] may have been threatened or in fear of abuse, but no crime has been committed.\"\n\nNowhere does the 2005 bill suggest one must be accused of a crime to have the statute apply.\n\nCicilline overstates the scope of the bill that Loughlin voted against. But he is correct to suggest that if Loughlin's side had prevailed, those subject to domestic violence restraining orders would be allowed to keep their guns.\n\nWe asked Loughlin's campaign manager to explain why he voted against the 2005 bill. Her answer:\n\n\"John is a supporter of the Second Amendment and he voted against this bill because it was too broad and he was concerned that there was no distinction made between handguns and antique collectibles or family heirlooms.\"\n\nThat may be true, but it doesn't change the accuracy of Cicilline's statement. We rate it Mostly True.\n\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-14163"}
