Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., as saying:\n\"The time is way past due for Donald Trump to release his tax returns, as every other major party nominee has done for the past 40 years.\"\nSo, let\u2019s see if that\u2019s what every Democratic and Republican presidential nominee since 1976 has done.\nWayback machine\nBaldwin has taken aim at Trump before, since he became the GOP nominee.\nIn August 2016, we rated Half True her claim that Trump \"has a long history of exporting jobs overseas.\" Trump-brand products such as his clothing have been made overseas, but those jobs were always abroad, not U.S. jobs that were moved.\nTo back her current claim, Baldwin\u2019s campaign cited editorials from the New York Times and the Washington Post, both of which said Trump would be the first major party candidate since 1976 -- 40 years ago -- not to release his tax returns. Also cited was an editorial from the Boston Globe, which said it\u2019s been more than 40 years.\nBut there is an exception.\nWe checked an archive of presidential tax returns maintained by the Tax Analysts, a publisher specializing in tax policy. It shows that going back to 1976, all but one major-party nominee released at least one return.\nOnly Republican Gerald Ford, who lost to Democrat Jimmy Carter in 1976, did not release returns (he released summary tax data), the archive shows. FactCheck.org also found Ford to be the one exception.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin LeMahieu\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a TV interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It takes quite a while on Election Day to load those ballots, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoe Thorndike, the Tax History Project director at Tax Analysts, told us that Ford\u2019s summaries were clearly not the same as tax returns. For instance, they didn\u2019t provide detailed information on things such as sources of income and charitable contributions.\nMoreover, it\u2019s impossible to know what might be in a return unless you see the return.\nIt's also worth noting that while some nominees have released numerous years of returns \u2013 1996 GOP nominee Bob Dole provided 30 years\u2019 worth \u2013 others have not. In 1980, Republican Ronald Reagan released only one return and in 2012, Republican Mitt Romney released two.\nIn the 2016 race, Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, has released returns from 2000 through 2015.\nAs for Trump, he has said he hasn\u2019t released his taxes because he is being audited. When he claimed he \"released the most extensive financial review of anybody in the history of politics. \u2026 You don't learn much in a tax return,\" PolitiFact National\u2019s rating was False.\nTrump did release an extensive (and legally required) document detailing his personal financial holdings. But experts say tax returns would offer valuable details on his effective tax rate, the types of taxes he paid and how much he gave to charity, as well as a more detailed picture of his assets.\nOur rating\nBaldwin says that except for Trump, \"every other major party nominee\" for the past 40 years has released their tax returns.\nShe\u2019s almost right. During that period, the only major-party presidential nominee who didn\u2019t release returns was Ford, the Republican nominee in 1976. It's also worth noting that many nominees have released numerous years of returns, but some have released only one or two.\nWe rate Baldwin\u2019s statement Mostly True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/3b799eb7-8454-41ff-a343-3c13c44e9c78", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04248"}
