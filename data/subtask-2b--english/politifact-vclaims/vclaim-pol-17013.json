Tony Evers has said expanded testing capacity is one of the benchmarks needed to begin a phased re-opening of Wisconsin in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.\nTesting has been a key chokepoint in Wisconsin and nationwide, with some people initially unable to get tested despite serious symptoms and officials scrambling to increase access.\nRepublicans in the state Legislature \u2014 who are suing to block an extension of Evers\u2019 \"Safer at Home\" order \u2014 honed in on this piece of the plan. An April 20, 2020 joint statement from Assembly Speaker Robin Vos and Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald listed a series of criticisms, including this one:\u00a0\n\"The governor also wants to postpone reopening until we increase testing when we are currently using only around 20% of our testing capacity.\"\nIs Wisconsin really only using 20% of its testing capacity? The claim implies the state could be conducting five times more tests if it chose.\nIt\u2019s a key question since the testing volume is one of the key areas of improvement Gov. Tony Evers has said we need before Wisconsin can take steps toward re-opening. It\u2019s part of a general outline he presented in his Badger Bounce Back plan April 20. It set a goal of 12,000 tests per day.\nWe found testing is a lot more complicated than how this claim presents it.\nHow testing works\nLet\u2019s start with the basics of what goes into a coronavirus test.\nThere are two elements to the test \u2014 the part done at the clinic or testing site by a health care worker, and what is done at the lab.\nHere\u2019s the breakdown from Dr. Alana Sterkel, assistant director of the Communicable Disease Division of the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. She\u2019s one of the people coordinating testing and distribution of collection supplies statewide.\nThe in-office portion \u2014 commonly called a collection kit \u2014 includes a nasal swab and a vial of transport liquid, which stabilizes and preserves the sample in transit to the lab. These are the exact materials that have been used for years to test for other respiratory viruses, such as the flu.\nCollecting the sample also means the health care worker and patient both need personal protective gear (PPE) of some kind, typically a mask for the patient and full-body protection for the worker.\nThe vial is then sent to a lab, which if it\u2019s located offsite would require shipping materials and a courier service. As of April 24, the state reports 48 labs are actively testing \u2014 a combination of the government labs, hospital system labs and independent private labs.\u00a0\nAt the lab, they need machines to run the physical test and chemicals to aid in the analysis. An array of different chemicals are used at different labs to conduct the test, collectively referred to as \"reagents.\"\nThe majority of tests done in Wisconsin now return results within 24 to 48 hours.\nA relatively small number of health care systems have rapid testing that can accomplish all this in-house and get a result before the end of an office visit. In some extreme cases, tests sent to a backlogged outside lab could take up to 10 days.\nDefining capacity\nThat brings us to the key word in the Fitzgerald/Vos claim \u2014 capacity.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Steineke\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembly Republicans \u201chave come to the table\u201d and were part of \u201cgive and take\u201d compromise on a coronavirus bill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe day Vos and Fitzgerald made this claim, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services reported a statewide testing capacity of 7,608. The actual number of tests conducted was 1,433, about about 19% of the testing capacity.\u00a0\nThe state\u2019s capacity tally is referring to how many tests labs are theoretically able to process, if everything else in the supply chain was in place to collect and deliver them.\nVos and Fitzgerald, meanwhile, are framing their claim around the idea that the capacity level cited by the state represents what can actually be conducted on a given day.\u00a0\nBut the process involves collection and testing, and sometimes transport. And, as seen in the process above, the list of components to a test is long \u2014 swab, transport liquid, protective gear, lab machinery and reagent, at a minimum.\n\"It\u2019s like baking cookies, that you need to have flour, eggs, butter and chocolate chips to make a batch of cookies, and if you don\u2019t have any one of those, you can\u2019t make cookies,\" Sterkel said. \"If one of those supply lines goes down, you go down altogether.\"\nPutting it all together\nIn short, the labs can handle a higher volume of tests than the rest of the system can actually conduct and send them right now.\u00a0\n\"That (20%) number is I think inaccurately representing what we\u2019re capable of doing right now,\" Sterkel said.\nFor starters, the state isn\u2019t exactly overflowing with testing supplies. Asked which elements of the supply chain are preventing Wisconsin from doing more tests, Sterkel said, \"Just about everything.\"\nAnd the testing capacity number is skewed by the inclusion of Exact Sciences, a Madison-based lab that has just started doing coronavirus testing. The massive lab accounts for about half of the state testing capacity number, but they are at least several weeks from being able to actually obtain that many tests to process.\u00a0\n\"This is testing that they did not previously do. They do not have existing relationships and ways to get samples to their lab, and this is something that needs to develop over time as they build those relationships with hospital systems,\" Sterkel said. \"They double the capacity in a very short amount of time in the state, but using that capacity will take time.\"\nA quick aside \u2013 testing is improving fast\nSterkel made sure to note that the outlook for testing in Wisconsin is positive and improving quickly from initial logjams. She is working to make sure patients and doctors both know testing is widely available.\n\"For a while we had to limit to only the most ill where it could make the biggest difference because that\u2019s all we could test,\" Sterkel said. \"Now we\u2019re able to test more, we need to get the message out that people should be testing more.\"\nShe said about half of the state\u2019s testing capacity \u2014 up around 11,000 as of April 24 \u2014 could be used today, though the collection supplies available now wouldn\u2019t necessarily sustain that volume indefinitely.\n\"The labs have been working very hard to build capacity very quickly,\" she said.\nOur ruling\nIn a joint statement, Vos and Fitzgerald criticized plans to hold up re-opening Wisconsin \u2014 in part \u2014 for increased testing, saying Wisconsin is \"currently using only around 20% of our testing capacity.\"\nThat is indeed the portion of testing currently in use, but the implication that the state could simply flip a switch and increase testing fivefold is wrong.\nThe state is in better shape than it was, but it still doesn\u2019t have the sample collection materials it would need to sustain that kind of increase. And half of the state\u2019s capacity is from Exact Sciences, which is likely a few weeks from having the supply chain in place to actually utilize its listed capacity.\nWe define Half True as a statement that\u2019s partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. That fits here.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17013"}
