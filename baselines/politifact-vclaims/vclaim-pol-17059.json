My view is that schools should be open,\" Trump said on Fox and Friends Aug. 5.\u00a0 \"If you look at children, children are almost, I would almost say definitely, but almost immune from this disease. So few. Hard to believe. I don\u2019t know how you feel about it but they have much stronger immune systems than we do somehow for this. They don\u2019t have a problem.\"\nBy the evening, both Facebook and Twitter took action against Trump for his statements about immunity and children which the social media companies said were violations of their policies against COVID-19 misinformation. Facebook took down a post of the Fox video clip on Trump\u2019s official account, with a spokesperson saying it contained false information that violated its standards around harmful COVID-19 misinformation. Twitter, meanwhile, required a Team Trump campaign account to remove the tweet. It appeared that Trump had tweeted the video from his own Twitter account but the video link was dead.\nTrump is using the term \"immune\" to suggest that children won\u2019t get sick. It\u2019s clear that children do get infected, although symptoms are often not as serious as those for older adults. But he\u2019s wrong to state that children are \"almost immune.\"\n\"Children as a group are clearly less impacted by this virus than adults, but to say they are almost immune does not provide a truthful message,\" said University of South Florida public health professor Dr. Marissa J. Levine.\nChildren account for about 7% of U.S. COVID-19 cases\nThe data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that children account for about 7.3% of cases. Children account for less than 1% of deaths.\u00a0\u00a0\nBut that data covers a time period when millions of children stayed home and did their classes online. That means we don\u2019t yet know what will happen when children return to school buildings.\u00a0\nAlthough it is early in the school year, there have already been some students who tested positive including in Mississippi and Indiana. It\u2019s unclear how many students will attend in person nationwide, although the majority of the largest school districts have chosen virtual learning.\u00a0\nMark Schleiss, a University of Minnesota professor of pediatrics, said Trump is wrong on two counts: his statement about immunity and his suggestion that children are less likely to catch the germ than adults.\n\"Immunity means that your immune system has some sense of history with having encountered the germ before, and hence can fight it off,\" he said. \"Well, what's the biological plausibility that any person would have immunity to a virus that didn't even exist until a few months ago? And how could you have immunity to it if you never even encountered it before? So, as a pediatrician, immunologist and vaccine researcher, the statement is absurd, and unequivocally incorrect.\"\nSchleiss pointed to a research letter published in The Journal of the American Medical Association by Lurie Children\u2019s Hospital of Chicago. Researchers examined 145 cases of mild to moderate COVID-19 illness and found children younger than 5 years have much higher levels of genetic material for the virus in their noses compared to older children and adults. Authors concluded that young children can potentially be important drivers of the virus spread, which causes concern for educators.\nExperts also pointed to the rapid spread of COVID-19 at an overnight camp in Georgia. Test results were available for 344 (58%) attendees; among these, 260 (76%) were positive. While children are in closer proximity to each other at overnight camp than a school, experts say it still serves as a warning about reopening schools.\u00a0\n\"That is not what we would expect of a group who were \u2018almost immune,\u2019\" Levine said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAndrew Noymer, an epidemiologist at University of California, Irvine, said Trump has a point in that children get sick at low rates, but his overall statement is misleading. The main fear about reopening schools is how it will spread to teachers and parents.\n\"The idea schools can open and everything is going to be hunky dory, sort of a summary of the president\u2019s intended message, that is misleading,\" Noymer said. \"I am worried kids can catalyze the pandemic even worse than it already is in terms of an engine of generating infection of adults.\"\nThe White House pointed to statements by CDC director Robert Redfield in favor of reopening schools and his agency\u2019s guidance on schools, but those statements didn\u2019t address immunity. The White House also pointed to statements by Dr. Scott Atlas that \"children under 18 have virtually zero risk of death from this\" or serious illness. Atlas is a senior fellow at the\u00a0conservative Hoover Institution at Stanford University and is the former chief of neuroradiology at Stanford University Medical Center.\nResearch from other countries\nStudies about school children and COVID-19 are limited, but research from other countries indicates that high schoolers who come in contact with the disease respond more like adults, while elementary children present a lower risk of spread.\u00a0\nA recent study out of South Korea looked at more than 1,200 cases of people with COVID-19. It found that the rate of infection was three times higher for children 10 to 19 years old than for children under 10.\nAfter schools reopened in Israel in late May, outbreaks forced hundreds of schools to close, the New York Times found.\n\"Opening schools, especially for children above the age of 10, in crowded settings, can facilitate transmission,\" Hagai Levine, an epidemiology professor at Hebrew University-Hadassah told PolitiFact. \"Education is a must. So the lesson from Israel is to prepare and look for careful, gradual opening. If possible, learn outdoors.\"\nIn its guidelines for schools, the CDC said infection seems to vary by age, with students 10 to 17 being more likely to catch the disease than those under 10.\nSome European countries did have success in reopening schools, but most didn\u2019t reopen school amid a spike of outbreaks like ones in some states in the U.S.\nExperts have warned that we can\u2019t assume the U.S. experience this fall will mirror that of some other countries.\n\"We may learn much more about COVID-19 in children as schools open,\" Levine said. \"That is part of the unknown for which I would be hesitant to conclude with blanket statements about pediatric immunity to COVID-19.\"\nOur ruling\nTrump said \"children are almost immune from this disease.\"\nThe White House cited a statement by the CDC director in support of schools reopening and a doctor who noted that kids rarely get severe cases, but that doesn\u2019t mean that children are immune to COVID-19. It\u2019s wrong to state that children are \"almost immune\" as we have seen cases spread at an overnight camp in the U.S. and at some schools, including in Israel.\nWe rate this statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17059"}
