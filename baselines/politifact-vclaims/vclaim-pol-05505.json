Scott Walker.\nOne of the first topics to emerge was college affordability.\nState Senate Minority Leader Jennifer Shilling, D-La Crosse, called for state legislation to enable student loan borrowers to refinance their student loans.\nRefinancing, of course, allows you to get a lower interest rate on an existing loan when interest rates drop.\nState Rep. Dale Kooyenga, a Republican from the Milwaukee suburb of Brookfield, countered by saying it\u2019s important to find ways to reduce the amount of loans students are amassing. And Kooyenga, an accountant, said he is open to discussing refinancing at the state level.\nThen, however, Kooyenga stated:\n\"A lot of student loans are already refinanced by the federal government.\"\nIf they are, then why has there been so much debate -- at both the state and federal levels -- about legislation to allow refinancing?\nPast fact checks\nWe\u2019ve examined claims about college student loans before.\nHalf True was the rating we gave U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., when she said in 2014 that four-year college students, on average, are graduating with $30,000 in student loan debt. The best data available was mixed on whether the figure was accurate.\nMostly False was the rating earned a couple of months later by Wisconsin\u2019s other U.S. senator, Republican Ron Johnson. He had said the affluent are taking advantage of student loans at the expense of middle-class families. In some cases, affluent people get a subsidized loan and, based on repayment programs, some small portion hits the federal government\u2019s general fund. But that\u2019s picked up by all taxpayers, not simply middle-class taxpayers with no ties to college.\nIn that item we described in a nutshell how federal student loans work:\nThe Department of Education budget draws on funds from the U.S. Treasury to shoulder the costs of subsidized loans, grants and the repayment of some loans. When loan payments are collected, those funds are then returned to the Treasury. Student loans generate tens of billions of dollars in revenue annually for the federal government. \u00a0\nPrivate banks also provide student loans.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow to Kooyenga\u2019s claim.\nRepayment options\nPrivate banks, of course, are free to refinance student loans. The decision is based on a number of factors, including whether the borrower has substantial income. After all, a student loan isn\u2019t like a car loan, where there is a car to serve as collateral.\nBut Kooyenga\u2019s claim is that Uncle Sam refinances a lot of student loans.\nThe federal government does offer consolidation for most student loans. That gives you one monthly payment on one loan, rather than multiple monthly payments on multiple student loans. But you might lose benefits such as principal rebates and end up with a longer payment period, racking up more in principal and interest payments in the process.\nStudent borrowers can also take advantage of different payment plans. For example, lower monthly payments in the first few years after college and higher payments over time.\nBut when it comes refinancing, the federal government doesn\u2019t do it.\nAs PolitiFact Texas found in a 2014 fact check, federal law simply makes no provision for the government to offer such refinancing.\nThe non-profit group American Student Assistance states it flatly: \"There is no federal refinancing \u2026 you cannot refinance federal or private student loans into a federal loan.\"\nIndeed, that\u2019s why Democrats have been pushing legislation to allow federal refinancing. Backers include Baldwin and Wisconsin Democrat Russ Feingold, who is seeking to win back his U.S. Senate seat from Johnson in 2016, as well as 2016 presidential contenders Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Martin O\u2019Malley.\nIn January 2016, Minnesota announced its own refinancing program and U.S. Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., announced new legislation that would do the same at the federal level.\nAs for Kooyenga, he told us his \"comments were not meant that an individual with student loan debt could approach the federal government and refinance. I was speaking to the fact that beginning in 2008 the federal government began purchasing the loans made by private lenders.\"\nSo, he was using the term refinancing in a more technical way, even though the context of the discussion was about students refinancing their loans through the government.\nOur rating\nKooyenga said: \"A lot of student loans are already refinanced by the federal government.\"\nBorrowers can refinance student loans through private banks, though it isn\u2019t necessarily easy and comes with down sides.\nDemocrats have pushed legislation to allow the federal government to offer refinancing, so that student borrowers can get lower interest rates. But that legislation has not been adopted, and the federal government does not do refinancing.\nWhich means Kooyenga\u2019s claim is False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05505"}
