One of the statistics he cited was wage growth.\n\"After years of wage stagnation, we are finally seeing rising wages,\" Trump said.\nHowever, that\u2019s problematic in two ways.\nWe asked Jed Kolko, the chief economist at the jobs site Indeed.com, for the best measure to use, and he said it was median usual weekly real earnings for full-time wage and salary workers, 16 years and over. This is a measure that tends to reflect the typical wages of people with stable employment and it is adjusted for inflation.\nThis figure has been calculated quarterly since 1979. Here\u2019s the full run of the data:\n\nThis data shows that after Trump entered office, wages initially went up, then fell. For the fourth quarter of 2017, the figure was $345. That\u2019s slightly below the $349 mark in the fourth quarter of 2016, before Trump entered office.\nEven if you allow for some quarterly blips, however, Trump\u2019s statement is also misleading in another way. The \"years of wage stagnation\" he refers to didn\u2019t end with Trump\u2019s presidency -- wage growth began under President Barack Obama.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWages hit their post-Great Recession low in the second quarter of 2014, at $330. They climbed, with just a few blips, for the rest of his presidency.\nWhen we asked the White House for data, they said, incorrectly, that the most recent data was from the third quarter of 2017.\nThe White House also offered another statistic: average real weekly earnings of all private-sector employees.\nFor this statistic, wages have indeed risen since Trump has been in office \u2014 by less than 1 percent from December 2016 to December 2017. But here, too, wages rose over the equivalent periods of time in 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016, in one case by as much as 2 percent over the course of a year. So it\u2019s incorrect to say the United States is \"finally\" seeing wage increases.\nOur ruling\nTrump said, \"After years of wage stagnation, we are finally seeing rising wages.\"\nBy the most common measure, wages did go up for the first three quarters of Trump\u2019s presidency, but they fell in the fourth, wiping out all the gains on his watch and then some. And even if you ignore this fourth quarter figure as a blip, his assertion ignores that wages \u2014 by two different measurements \u2014 began their climb during the final years of Obama\u2019s presidency.\nWe rate his statement Mostly False.\n Share the Facts 2018-01-31 04:24:44 UTC   PolitiFact    3 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly False   \"After years of wage stagnation, we are finally seeing rising wages.\"    Donald Trump President    his State of the Union address Tuesday, January 30, 2018 2018-01-30    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02469"}
