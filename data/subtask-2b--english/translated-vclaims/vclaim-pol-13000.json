During the 2011 spring session, legislators sought to increase the penalties for permitting underage drinking. The Republic of State, Kathleen Basidomo, R-Nablis, was among the legislators who voted in favour of the bill, which was approved by an overwhelming majority. On May 30, 2011, the Napole Daily News article, had a small way of proposing a sentence for the crime that was very weak. \"It's a bigger crime to have an unmarked crocodile than to host an open house party.\" She was not the first to make such a statement. \"I think it's a little weird to protect a crocodile more than our children,\" according to an article on 29 March of The St. Petersburg Times. Legislative Assistant Goodson (Amy Gregory) said in an e-mail that Goodson was the first to use the gator comparison during his presentation to the committees. Both Pasidomo and Goodson made comments prior to the signing of the bill - which was due to enter into force on 1 July. It was approved by the House of Representatives on 29 April and adopted by the Senate on 3 May 38.1. The bill has not yet been sent to the Government. Rick Scott signed it, according to his spokesman, Lynn Wright. We wanted to achieve: Is the punishment more severe for an unmarked crocodile than hosting an underage drinking party? Is this about to change? Articles 379-3751 and 379-3752 of the Statute relate to the requirements for the seizure of the crocodile - for the arrest, killing or equipping of the crocodile - and for obtaining a licence. We met with spokespersons at the Florida Commission for Conservation of Fish and Wildlife - Officer Jorge Pino and Katie Purcell - for some background information on the marking of the alligator. According to the Commission's website, \"licensors who are granted a permit must submit payment for two signs of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and a licence to strip the crocodile, or proof of possession of a valid crocodile fishing licence until the end of the Crocodile harvest season. Florida's fishing license is not required to participate in a state-wide crocodile chase.\" The sign - which fishermen must place on the crocodile - allows officials to verify that the hunter has obtained the appropriate authorization. The State Law 379.409 provides that any person who unlawfully kills, owns or catches a crocodile faces a third degree felony. Why a felony? \"These animals were on the verge of extinction in the early 1970s,\" said Pino. \"Because of our efforts to try to recover species, we were very successful. Some people might argue that we were very successful -- there are a lot of crocodiles in Florida. We need to protect Florida's natural resources. :: Open House to Underage Drinking Act: During the 2011 session, the legislature amended Law 856.015 by Law 105 of the House of Representatives. The staff analysis of this bill provides a summary of how the law has been changed: \"Article 856.015, F.S., provides that a person who controls a residence that the Open House Party is allowed to carry out commits a second degree misdemeanour if he or she knows that a minor possesses or consumes any alcohol or drugs in his or her home and has not taken responsible steps to prevent the minor from acquiring or consuming alcohol or drugs. The bill also amends the current law to make the second or subsequent violation a first-degree misdemeanour. This bill also provides that any violation resulting in serious bodily injury or death shall be punishable by a first-degree misdemeanour.\" This means that prior to 1 July, the hosting of an open ceremony for the Palais would have led to a second-degree misdemeanour. After the promulgation of the law, it became a first-degree misdemeanour in some circumstances - both of which were less than a third-degree offence for violations of a crocodile. Now let's compare the penalties: state law 775.082 provides that a third-degree felony is punishable by up to five years' imprisonment. A second-degree misdemeanour carries up to 60 days of imprisonment, while a first-degree misdemeanour, a person can land in prison for one year. Mr. Thad Altman, R. Rockledge, a shepherd, said in an interview with Politi Vac that legislators had discussed increasing the punishment of the Open House Act for a felony but had met with some resistance. \"Exploring the number of crimes is being bred by some legislators, as he said. \"This is a very measured approach... at least one step in the right direction. We hope to save the lives of some children.\" :: Attorney General Broward Howard Finklestein, a democracy, said that the comparison of the two laws was politically motivated. But he said that most criminal laws follow the intent. When someone picks up a gun, he directs it to an animal and pulls the trigger, the person intends to kill the animal. \"When you host -- regardless of misthinking -- a party of underage teenagers where there's drinking, it's clearly not the intention of the homeowner to get drunk and kill someone,\" said in an interview. So the illegal crocodile trap can send someone to prison for five years while hosting an open house party that can -- as of June -- send someone to prison for two months, maybe after July 1 for a year. A murder charge? But wait... we're not done yet. If the father is hosting an underage drinking party and one of the teenagers ends up dead, can the host be charged with manslaughter? That would be one way to impose a much more severe punishment. The prosecutors have tried the path of manslaughter at least occasionally. In the examples we found, however, they were unsuccessful: in May 2010, Diane Santarielli's jury, a 52-year-old mother from St. John's County, found not guilty of wrongful murder in the case of adolescents who died in an alcohol-related car crash after leaving a party hosted by Santarielli and her daughter, according to an article issued on 21 May 2010, Florida Times-union. The mother was convicted of two less serious crimes: hosting an open ceremony and contributing to minor delinquency. The article reads as follows: \"In order to be convicted of manslaughter, the judge instructed the jurors to determine that they had been held responsiblely negligent. The prosecutor had to prove that her behaviour was awful and blatant and showed reckless disregard for human life or safety, among other qualified factors.\" The article reads: \"The first case of manslaughter in Florida dealt with the death of an underage person after alcohol consumption at an open house party.\" \u2022 In 2002, the Miami-Dade grand jury refused to charge a couple with manslaughter after two teenagers attended a ceremony at the home of the couple who later died in a car accident, according to an article issued on 20 July 2005 in Miami Herald. And a jury acquitted the Open Party Lawman. But in that case, there was conflicting testimony about the duration of the father &apos; s presence during the party. \u2022 The Florida Highway Patrol recommended that charges of manslaughter be brought against an assistant baseball instructor and roommate for hosting a teenage drinking party hours before three people died in a fatal car accident in Martin County. However, the prosecutors said that the evidence only supported the charges of misdemeanours, according to the Palm Beach Post article of 7 August 2010. David \"Bobba\" Harper, 28 years old, coach, and Craig Frick, 24 years old, didn't demand competition. On January 27, 2021, Marco Rubio stated in his remarks: \"Only in the Third World you do not see the usual use of the trials of former leaders.\" Possession of an unmarked crocodile is a felony that can put a person in prison for five years in Florida. The Open Party Act as of June 2011 is a misdemeanour -- and if the Governor signs a revised version, it will remain a misdemeanour. However, in some circumstances, it will rise from the second to the first degree, leading to imprisonment for a maximum of one year. We're assessing this claim right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13000"}
