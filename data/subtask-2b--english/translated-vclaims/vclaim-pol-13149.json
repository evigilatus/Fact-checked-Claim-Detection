Scott Walker plans to press for legislation that allows the state to take over municipal governments.", "text": "Wisconsin is not the only State that drives national political titles. In Michigan, a new law allows the Governor to seize local governments that are in financial trouble. Benton Harbor is one of several Michigan municipalities that failed in a financial \"stress test,\" and is now under the control of a State-appointed director who has, among other things, the power to cancel contracts with public employees' unions. Local elected officials no longer control matters. The protests escalate on what critics call \"infiltrations\" and at least once the prosecution claims that the measure gives the State \"semi-Caesar\" powers. Could financial advertising \"military law\" come to Wisconsin? According to former democratic activist Ed Garvey, these steps are the next on the agenda of the Republican Government. (Scott Walker) On April 14, 2011, he first raised the issue on his blog Wittingbob.com, and then repeated it in subsequent bulletins, on Wisconsin Public Radio and in an interview with PoliticyFact Wisconsin. Rick Angar, a blogger on Forbes.com, picked up Garvey's assertions on April 16th with a publication entitled \"Gov. Scott Walker says he's planning the Wisconsin Financial Military Code. Two days later, during a radio interview on 18 April, Walker strongly denied his involvement in any such plan. Did Garvey reveal the next controversial political thrust of the Walker team? Now, we cannot judge the expected claims - what will happen in the future. But we can look at what Garvey says he did -- reveal the plans that are being implemented -- and whether his evidence supports his claim. Let's go to the original Garvey blog. \"We have discovered that the Governor of Wisconsin has the same twisted idea as the Governor of Michigan does to his jurisdiction.\" Garvey April 14, 2011 wrote on his blog. \"The State will be allowed to take over local government if financial management standards are not met. Who decides? :: The Governor or a newly elected observer. I'm not making this up.\" He adds: \"The secret plan is being prepared by the largest law firm in the state, Foley and Lardner, for the Grand Milwaukee Commission, the Bradley Foundation, the Governor and the main legislators.\" A closer look at the evidence shows that it's not like Machiavillian, as Garvey claims. Garvey discovered a recently launched website, Makettiourmilwakicounty.com, which illustrates a legislative initiative. But this is hardly a secret. The web site is the electronic version of a project launched by a Task Force of the Meiloki Grand Commission. It is the result of a year-long effort by the private business group to study the Government of the Province of Milwaukee and recommend its reforms. The Task Force &apos; s recommendations drew attention in the 9 October 2010 column by Dan Bice of the newspaper Sentinel, who wrote the recommendations, back so that they would not be issued before the November elections for the office of Governor. In November, Politi Vaki\u0107 and Wisconsin considered an allegation by the State Democratic Party that the president of the Governing Council and the head of the Walker Grape campaign had killed the launch of the report before the elections. We said the claim was barely true. In February, the Council Task Force announced its recommendations and the website was launched at approximately the same time. The report calls for several initiatives, including: \"To test state-wide financial pressures through the Ministry of Government Revenue to help local governments maintain financial health.\" So the site is talking about \"stress test,\" but that's not the same style as \"military law\" in Michigan. In fact, the website explicitly states that the group opposes this approach: \"The initiative does not support this type of legislation in Wisconsin.\" What's more, according to GMC President Julia Taylor, about half of the states have a \"financial results record.\" She said that thinking was that the more people know how their local governments are going, the sooner we solve problems. Taylor said that she was not sure when or by whom a bill containing the Council &apos; s plan would be submitted. She said, \"It's too early in this process.\" \"At this point we don't have a written language.\" Surely some of the people in serious distress are working with the General Governing Council to build support for the recommendations and turn them into legislation - including lobby groups with Foley and Lardner, Mary Panzer, a former member of the State Legislative Council, and Muller Public Relations Communications. The General Governing Council is chaired by Ghraib, who was the head of the Walker campaign and led the Governor &apos; s Transition Team. The Bradley Foundation is also headed by a stranger. Therefore, it may be easy to see why Garvey is trying to connect some points. And what about the essence of Garvey's claim, that he discovered Walker's involvement with the plan under discussion -- and therefore, his support for her? Walker, as Executive Director of Milwaukee Province, expressed support for the Council &apos; s efforts. However, following Garvey &apos; s first post, he made a sharp denial of his involvement now. \"There is no truth in that at all. On April 18, 2011, Walker said in an interview with WTMJ-AM (620) the host of the Charlie Sykes Dialogue Programme. \"There's no one on my crew, no one in my department, I certainly don't do anything close.\" However, in an interview, Garvey said that he still believed that Walker was involved. \"I think that's true,\" he said. \"It all fits a pattern.\" But thinking about something real and showing it's true are two different things. Garvey says he discovered a secret plot by Walker to push legislation along the lines of Michigan that would allow the State to test the finances of local governments and then grab bad apples. The Miloki Grand Commission proposes a \"good government\" website that allows citizens to compare and compare the health of local government funding. But it clearly stops following the Michigan style. Furthermore, Garvey did not disclose this (as previously announced by the group) and did not provide any direct evidence of Walker &apos; s involvement, which he strongly denied. This measure can be changed through the legislative process, but this is the future. Garvey had a scoop. But it was more than gardening -- not journalism -- diversity. We assess his claim is wrong. Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" \u2022 January 26, 2012", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13149"}
