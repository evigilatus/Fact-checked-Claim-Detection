In fact, Iran has more holders of American Ph.D.s in its presidential cabinet than France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, or Spain \u2014 combined.\nWhat\u2019s the significance? The cabinet of scholars could launch a new chapter in Iran\u2019s typically troubled relations with western countries and negotiations over its nuclear program -- or not, Na\u00edm wrote, since the country\u2019s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, ultimately calls the shots.\n\"But compared to the kind of people that Ahmadinejad had in his cabinet, they were a very different kind of crowd,\" Na\u00edm told PunditFact by phone. \"So one would expect people with American Ph.D.s to be more sophisticated, more integrated in the world.\"\nHis piece singled out three Iranian cabinet officials from the 30-position body with American degrees. PunditFact verified each of the following officials graduated from these American universities:\n\n\nMohammad Agha Nahavandian, Rouhani\u2019s chief of staff, was awarded a Ph.D. in economics on Jan. 30, 1994, from George Washington University.\n\n\nMohammad Javad Zarif, the country\u2019s foreign affairs minister, completed his Ph.D. in international law and politics at the University of Denver in 1988. Zarif, who was the lead negotiator in the nuclear deal, was Iran\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations based in New York.\n\n\nAli Akbar Salehi, a vice president and head of Iran\u2019s Atomic Energy Organization, earned a Ph.D. in nuclear engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1977.\n\n\nSeveral other members of Rouhani\u2019s Cabinet graduated from universities in Europe, according to Na\u00edm\u2019s piece. His minister of information and communications technology, Mahmoud Vaezi, enrolled at a doctoral program at Louisiana State University after studying at other American schools but ended up finishing his Ph.D. in international relations at Warsaw University in Poland. Even Rouhani earned a doctorate from Glasgow Caledonian University in Scotland, and several other members have advanced degrees from Iranian universities.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRouhani\u2019s cabinet has an important role in preparing policy and budgets, but it\u2019s not all that powerful because decisions can be overruled by the supreme leader\u2019s office and the Guardian Council, which is appointed by the supreme leader and considers legislation, said Alex Vatanka, an expert on Iran at the Middle East Institute. The U.S. Cabinet does not face similar wildcards, he said.\n\"There is no sort of element of surprise in the middle of it with one of the priests coming from nearby churches saying, \u2018No, no, this is ungodly and shouldn\u2019t be done\u2019,\" Vatanka said.\n\"The cabinet has been a way for the president to cautiously advance a reform agenda in Iran,\" said Jon Alterman, director of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\nHe pointed out that another Rouhani adviser who is not in the cabinet, Mahmood Sariolghalam, earned a Ph.D. from the University of Southern California.\nHow does Obama\u2019s Cabinet compare?\nThere are a couple of ways of looking at Obama\u2019s Cabinet, and neither measure produces more doctoral degrees from American universities than the three we confirmed in Iran. The U.S. cabinet is stacked with lawyers, which is pretty typical.\nThe advisory group includes Vice President Joe Biden and the leaders of 15 executive agencies. Of those, just one has an American Ph.D.\nErnest Moniz, Obama\u2019s energy secretary, has no fewer than four honorary degrees. The one that counts for our purpose is his doctorate in theoretical physics from Stanford University.\nIf you expand the pool to include seven more Cabinet-rank officials listed on the same White House page, you find another doctorate. That\u2019s Jason Furman, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, who earned a Ph.D. in economics from Harvard University (as well as master\u2019s degrees in government from Harvard and in economics from the London School of Economics).\nOur ruling\nBob Schieffer referenced an Atlantic piece when he said Rouhani\u2019s cabinet has more members with Ph.D.s from American universities than Obama\u2019s.\nWhile we could not nail down the academic background of each member of Iran\u2019s cabinet, we found enough members with verifiable degrees -- three -- to deem his statement accurate. Obama has two, including one official with Cabinet-rank.\nWhat it all means for international relations remains to be seen.\nWe rate Schieffer\u2019s statement True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08497"}
