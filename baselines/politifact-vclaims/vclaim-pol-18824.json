The author of the tweet later deleted the tweet.\nThis Facebook post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nThe text in the post says \"early ballots\" but it appears to be a reference to mail-in ballots, as evidenced by the fact that it included a link to a Miami-Dade Democrats page about how voters can \"cure\" or fix their mail in ballot if a voter forgot to sign the envelope or their signature didn\u2019t match.\nAs of the morning Oct. 30, the county had received 449,645 vote by mail ballots, including 3,308 that were rejected, said Suzy Trutie, spokesperson for Miami-Dade Supervisor of Elections. That comes to slightly less than 1%.\nAbout 2,313 of those rejected ballots were missing a signature on the ballot envelope. The signature did not match on 569 ballots. Smaller numbers of ballots were rejected for other reasons including that some voters had moved out of the county.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.

So far, about 2,016 of those ballots have been cured.\u00a0\nThe 23% statistic could have come from a misinterpretation of an Oct. 16 op-ed in the Tampa Bay Times by University of Florida professor Daniel A. Smith and Dartmouth College professor Michael C. Herron.\n\"Although Miami-Dade County accounts for only 7.2% of mail ballots cast by Florida voters, it accounts for nearly 23% of the state\u2019s mail ballots received without signatures,\" they wrote.\nThe purpose of that part of the op-ed was to point out the variability in ballots being received without signatures \u2014 as of earlier this month. The op-ed didn\u2019t state that 23% of ballots in Miami-Dade had been rejected.\u00a0\nRELATED: Ask PolitiFact: Is it too late to mail in your ballot?\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post said\u00a0 \"Miami-Dade reporting 23% of early ballots being rejected for missing signatures.\"\u00a0\nA spokesperson for the county elections office said that less than 1% of mail ballots have been rejected, including many that were missing signatures.
