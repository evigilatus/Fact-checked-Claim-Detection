The group, comprised of Democrats, Republicans and independents, launched its website\u00a0on Dec. 13, 2010, in the hopes of starting a movement that \"encourages leaders to \u2018put the labels aside\u2019 in an effort to seek common sense solutions to our nation's problems.\"\n\nThe launch brought out independents like outgoing Florida Gov. Charlie Crist and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who both spoke at a kickoff event in New York City that was live-streamed on the No Labels website.\n\nAlso speaking was Ellen Freidin, chairwoman of\u00a0Fair Districts Florida, a group behind the passage of two\u00a0 constitutional amendments that set new guidelines for how legislative and congressional districts are drawn up. Freidin used the occasion to note: \"We have dozens of districts that go for 150 to 200 miles, splitting counties, splintering cities and connecting areas that have very little in common.\"\n\nWe decided to take a closer look at Freidin\u2019s statement. The\u00a0Fair Districts Florida website cites two examples of such districts, but we were curious to see if there were dozens of examples, as Freidin stated.\n\nAbout redistricting\n\nFirst, some background on how Florida\u2019s districts are created. It\u2019s an issue bound to be back in the limelight as state legislators restart the process of translating those numbers into political boundaries on a map.\n\nEvery 10 years -- two years after U.S. Census figures are compiled -- state lawmakers redraw state and congressional legislative districts. The objective is to adjust district sizes to reflect changes in the population. Occasionally, new congressional districts are added when a state gains population. For example, Florida gained two House seats this time.\n\nThe civics book reason for periodic redistricting is to protect the value of each voter\u2019s ballot by preventing it from being diluted by a population surge -- the goal being for each person's vote to\u00a0carry relatively equal\u00a0weight in\u00a0elections. But the process of redistricting is never without accusations of \"gerrymandering\" often brought up against the party in power.\n\nThe term dates back to 1812 when Massachusetts Gov. Eldbridge Gerry signed a bill to redistrict Massachusetts. A newspaper noted that the contorted districts on the map resembled\u00a0salamanders, and the term \"gerrymander'' has since come to mean creating districts for political motive over geographical proximity.\n\nThe Florida website for the redistricting that was carried out in 2002 gives a sense of the process and numbers involved.\n\nThe Legislature divided the state\u2019s population evenly\u00a0into 120 state House districts, each containing a little over 130,000\u00a0people. Records show the number of registered voters per district ranged between 45,000\u00a0and 98,000.\n\nThe same population is divided evenly into\u00a040 state Senate districts. Each\u00a0district's\u00a0population hovered\u00a0around 399,000, with the number of registered voters varying from about 134,000 to 280,000.\n\nFlorida's Congressional districts contained\u00a0a uniform population of 639,295, give or take a few people, and\u00a0had voter registration\u00a0ranging from\u00a0about 232,600 to 418,700. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nDuring the November 2010 election, Florida voters approved two amendments to the state constitution that set specific guidelines in the creation of such districts. Amendment 5 was geared toward state districts and Amendment 6 was to be applied to congressional districts.\n\nBoth amendments say districts should not be drawn to favor incumbents or a particular political party. Districts must be contiguous, compact and follow local and geographical boundaries. The districts shall also not be drawn to interfere with minority representation as provided for in the Voting Rights Act.\n\nThe amendments were brought forth by Fair Districts Florida, a\u00a0group that collected 1.7 million signatures to get the questions on the state ballot.\n\nA look at our districts\n\nSo, do the districts created\u00a0in 2002\u00a0\"go on for 150 to 200 miles, splitting counties, splintering cities and connecting areas that have very little in common?''\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nHere, with the distances for the larger districts approximated\u00a0by plugging cities into Mapquest,\u00a0are some examples we found of both state and congressional districts that\u00a0speak to the issue at hand:\n\nThe 2nd Congressional District \n\nThis Panhandle district represented by newly elected Republican Steve Southerland\u00a0contains the largest number of counties in the state's delegation\u00a0-- 16. It takes in some or all of Bay, Calhoun, Dixie, Franklin, Gadsden, Gulf, Jackson, Jefferson, Lafayette, Leon, Liberty, Okaloosa, Suwannee, Taylor, Wakulla and Walton counties. Approximate distance covered: 240 miles.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThe 3rd and 4th Congressional Districts\u00a0\n\nThe 3rd District, represented by Democratic Rep. Corrine Brown, contains portions of\u00a0larger cities like Jacksonville and Orlando, while also taking in smaller communities like Gainesville and Apopka. The 2010 edition of the Almanac of American Politics\u00a0notes that the district has three sets of borders. Designed in 1992 to be North Florida's black majority seat,\u00a0from a partisan point of view it was\u00a0also created\u00a0\"to shift as many Democrats as possible to the 3rd District to strengthen Republicans elsewhere,'' the Almanac says.\u00a0It taps Democratic voters\u00a0in the center of Jacksonville,\u00a0then picks up voters in\u00a0Orlando and\u00a0Gainesville, with stops in\u00a0Sanford and smaller communities.\u00a0Approximate distance covered: 210 miles.\n\nMeanwhile, Republican Rep. Ander Crenshaw's 4th District stretches across the northern border\u00a0of the state from the Atlantic shore in Nassau County\u00a0to Tallahassee in the center. It includes, as the Almanac notes, \"much of Jacksonville,\u00a0minus the African-American neighborhoods,'' and\u00a0runs west through Baker, Union, Columbia, Hamilton, Madison, Jefferson and Leon counties.\u00a0Approximate distance covered: 165 miles.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe 5th Congressional District \n\nCarved from west-Central Florida, this district represented in the upcoming Congress by Republican Rich Nugent stretches from the northern tip of Polk County to include nearly all of distant, rural Levy County,\u00a0large portions of Lake, Marion and Pasco\u00a0counties\u00a0and all of Sumter,\u00a0Citrus and Hernando counties. Approximate distance covered: 140 miles.\n\nThe 6th Congressional District \n\nRepublican U.S. Rep. Cliff Stearns' district is another that takes a bite out of the metropolitan Jacksonville area. From there it\u00a0wobbles south through\u00a0wooded north-central Florida, shaving off part of Gainesville and stopping in\u00a0Lake County,\u00a0a short drive from Orlando. In the process it takes in some or all of\u00a0Duval, Clay, Bradford, Alachua, Gilchrist, Levy, Marion and Lake counties. Approximate distance covered: 146 miles.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe 10th and 11th Congressional Districts \n\nDemocratic Rep.\u00a0Kathy Castor's 11th District used to be entirely\u00a0in Tampa and Hillsborough County, but during the\u00a02002 redistricting,\u00a0a sizable pocket of Democratic voters\u00a0in South St. Petersburg were frog-marched across Tampa\u00a0Bay, electorally speaking,\u00a0to be joined with Democratic kindred\u00a0spirits. The district also picked up a piece of Manatee County. The effect\u00a0boosted the\u00a0GOP margins in Pinellas\u00a0County, where Republican Rep. C.W. Bill Young\u00a0holds the 10th District, which voted for Bill Clinton in 1996 and Al Gore in 2000.\u00a0Young's district is the only one in Florida contained wholly\u00a0within a single\u00a0county's borders.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe 16th Congressional District \n\nRepresented by Republican Tom Rooney, the district\u00a0stretches from the Atlantic coast on the east almost to the Gulf of Mexico, and was described\u00a0in the 2010 edition of the Almanac of American Politics as \"one of the most oddly designed districts in the nation.\u2019\u2019\u00a0The district spans parts of Charlotte, Glades, Hendry, Highlands, Okeechobee, St. Lucie, Martin and Palm Beach counties. Approximate distance covered: 155 miles.\n\u00a0\n\nThe 22nd Congressional District \n\nWhile the district was once a Democratic stronghold, it recently traded hands into the Republican party when Allen West defeated Democrat Ron Klein. the narrow coastal district, which stretches from Palm Beach Gardens down to Cooper City Broward County, may be a straight shot down the coast, but the western portion of the district is a series of electoral cul-de-sacs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 The 25th Congressional District\n\nThe needs of voters in the largely Hispanic enclaves of West Miami-Dade County like Hialeah Gardens may have little in common with the needs of older rural voters in Collier County, but the two Republican-leaning areas are linked in the same congressional district. The 25th District was one of two new\u00a0districts carved out by the Legislature in 2002. Mario-Diaz Balart, who was Florida House majority leader at the time, also chaired the redistricting committee that created the district. Diaz-Balart, a Republican, was subsequently elected the district\u2019s first congressman in 2002. It is about to pass to newly elected U.S. Rep. David Rivera, also a Republican.\u00a0\n\nState Senate District 1\n\nSen. Tony Hill's district cascades south through Duval\u00a0County, spreading out in central St. Johns, and sending a spur line into Putnam County,\u00a0and dips\u00a0south to take in a large swath of Flagler County and a looping portion of Volusia County. Approximate distance covered: 108 miles.\n\n\n\n\n\nState Senate District 3\n\nState Sen. Charlie Dean\u2019s\u00a0district covers Baker, Dixie, Hamilton, Lafayette, Suwannee and Taylor counties, in addition to parts of Citrus, Columbia, Jefferson, Leon, Levy, Madison and Marion counties. Approximate distance covered: 272 miles.\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nState Senate District 7\n\nRepresented by Republican Sen. Evelyn J. Lynn, this district snakes from Clay County down to Putnam and Marion counties and covers most of Volusia County. Approximate distance covered: 165 miles.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nState Senate District 8\n\n\nRepublican Sen. John Thrasher\u2019s district is spread\u00a0along the Atlantic coast, running through Nassau,\u00a0Duval, St. Johns, Flagler and\u00a0Volusia counties. Approximate distance covered: 144 miles.\n\n\n\n\nState Senate District 14\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepublican Sen. Steve Oelrich's district covers Alachua, Bradford, Gilchrist and Union counties with portions of Columbia, Levy, Marion, and Putnam counties in the fold. Approximate distance covered: 85 miles.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\nState Senate District 15\n\nRepublican Sen. Paula Dockery's district is carved where four\u00a0counties converge -- Hernando, Sumter, Lake and Polk, throwing in\u00a0a piece of Osceola County to fill it out. Approximate distance covered: 159 miles. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nState Senate District 18\n\nThe district, represented by Democratic Sen. Arthenia Joyner, covers parts of East and South Tampa, South St. Petersburg in Pinellas County and a sliver of Manatee County. Approximate distance covered: 57 miles.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nState Senate District 21\n\nRepublican Sen. Mike Bennett's district covers nearly all of Manatee County, plus pieces of Sarasota, DeSoto, Charlotte and Lee counties (and the Senate\u00a0misspells Charlotte on its website map). Approximate distance covered: 124 miles. \u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nState Senate District 26\n\nThe district represented by Republican Senate President Mike Haridopolos covers coastal areas of Brevard County, but also covers portions of Osceola and Indian River counties. Approximate distance covered: 164 miles.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nState Senate District 27\n\nThe district, currently represented by Palm Beach County Republican Lizbeth Benacquisto, spans five counties (Palm Beach, Glades, Hendry\u00a0Charlotte and Lee) and travels nearly coast to coast from West Palm Beach in the east to Fort Myers in the west. Approximate distance covered: 140 miles.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nState Senate District 28\n\nRepublican Sen. Joe Negron's\u00a0district hugs the highly developed southeastern coast, except when it veers deep into the state to pick up\u00a0portions of Okeechobee, St. Lucie, Martin and Palm Beach counties. Approximate distance covered: 109 miles. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nState Senate District 39\n\nDemocratic Sen. Larcenia Bullard\u2019s district covers a vast geographic terrain from Hendry County to rural Immokalee in Collier County, plus urban areas in Broward, Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties and down to the Florida Keys in Monroe County. Approximate distance covered; 268 miles.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nState House districts are\u00a0more compact\u00a0because they take in a smaller population, but they do meander from time to time, with electoral\u00a0ramifications for the counties and towns affected.\u00a0Here are a few notable clusters:\n\nState House Districts 29, 30, 31, 32\n\nThis Atlantic coast region is solidly Republican, with Tom Goodson in district 29, Ritch Workman in district 30, John Tobia in district 31 and Steve Crisafulli in district 32. Despite the GOP nature of the territory, it is still\u00a0carved into\u00a0byzantine interlocking connections of neighborhoods and towns around Melbourne and the beach communities to the north and south.\u00a0\n\nState House Districts 35, 36,\u00a038, 39, 40, 41, 49\n\nThese districts, taken together, are a case study of\u00a0the political legerdemain when district lines are drawn. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nDistricts 36, 39 and 49 rub shoulders in the urban Orlando area, and present\u00a0three faces of the Democratic Party -- white liberal, African American and Hispanic.\u00a0The state House district interactive map puts them in political perspective.\u00a0District\u00a036, represented by liberal Democrat Scott Randolph,\u00a0is\u00a0shaped vaguely like\u00a0a lobster,\u00a0with its claws in\u00a0northern and eastern Orange County and its\u00a0body in the center of Orlando.\u00a0\n\nDistrict 39, represented by\u00a0African American\u00a0Rep. Geraldine Thompson, is a more solid, cohesive\u00a0block of voters.\u00a0\n\nDistrict 49, represented by Darren Soto,\u00a0tracks the Hispanic population through west Orlando, down to Kissimmee and elsewhere, spreading across Orange and Osceola counties.\n\nAll around them are Republican districts enjoying a carefully crafted symbiotic relationship. Between the lobster's claws rests the wealthy enclave of Winter Park, in district 35, home to\u00a0Republican House Speaker Dean Cannon. Nearby is the southern edge of Apopka Republican Rep. Bryan Nelson's district 38, which picks up voters in the gaps between Democratic districts 36 and 39.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nDistrict 40, represented by Republican Eric Eisnaugle, is another odd configuration, cobbling together disparate suburbs in lumps and bulges\u00a0constituting\u00a0southern GOP border of this\u00a0political nexus.\n\nNeighboring district 41, represented by Republican Stephen Precourt, is where the\u00a0tidy urban divisions really begin to break down.\u00a0With districts 36 and 39\u00a0holding large groups of Democrats across the border, this Republican district sprawls west from\u00a0Orange County into the old Florida region of\u00a0south Lake County, and\u00a0dips into Osceola County to the south. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0State House Districts 55, 67, 68 and 69\n\nWith its southern end sandwiched narrowly between three Republican districts, district 55, represented by Democrat Darryl\u00a0Rouson,\u00a0combines voters in Sarasota, Manatee, Hillsborough and Pinellas counties.\u00a0Meanwhile, Republican Rep. Greg Steube's district 67 takes\u00a0eastern chunks of Sarasota and Manatee\u00a0counties along with an oddly shaped\u00a0section of southern Hillsborough County. Republican Rep. Jim Boyd's district 68 covers the more affluent beach communities around Bradenton, and district 69, represented\u00a0 by Republican Jay Pilon, takes in south Manatee and Sarasota, enveloping the southern tip of Rouson's district. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nState House Districts 78, 79, 80, 84\n\nDistrict 78,\u00a0represented by\u00a0Democrat Stephen Perman,\u00a0contains a large portion of western Palm Beach County, plus odd pieces of Martin, St. Lucie and Okeechobee\u00a0counties, including what looks like a surgical sliver of metropolitan Fort Pierce. It also wraps around district 84, represented by Haitian-born Democrat Mack Bernard, whose district includes Belle Glade and the surrounding area, then tracks along a road east to pick up more voters in neighborhoods around West Palm Beach. North of this oddly shaped pair of Democratic districts it is solidly Republican. Mike Horner's district 79 runs\u00a0north from Okeechobee\u00a0County through Osceola County and\u00a0picks up chunks of Orange and Polk\u00a0counties. And Debbie Mayfield's district 80 tracks the jagged edge of Perman's district to the Atlantic Ocean. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nState House Districts 101 and 112\n\nNaples Republican Matt Hudson's district is a political oddity with\u00a0two nodes of urbanization separated\u00a0by thousands of square miles of swamp, farms and open land. To the east it\u00a0picks up a little of\u00a0urban Broward County\u00a0along the edge of\u00a0Pembroke Pines, then\u00a0it slides\u00a0west through a\u00a0long, narrow\u00a0passage that includes the Everglades and Big Cypress swamp,\u00a0emerging amidst a host of suburban neighborhoods\u00a0around Naples, in Collier County.\u00a0Approximate distance covered; 108 miles. The same strange geography and approximate distance applies with district 112, represented by Miami Republican Jeanette Nunez.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nWinnowing\u00a0people\u00a0by\u00a0party alliance does raise a basic question about\u00a0representative government --\u00a0Should a politician be given carte blanche to discard certain voters, or would the public good be better served\u00a0if the offfice-holder were required to take divergent views into account? But that discussion is not why we're here.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSo, back to the question at hand. Was Freidin accurate in stating that Florida has \"dozens of districts that go for 150 to 200 miles, splitting counties, splintering cities and connecting areas that have very little in common?\" \u00a0\n\nFlorida has a total of 185 legislative and congressional districts -- 120 in the state House, 40 in the Senate and 25 in Congress. Of those, 67, or 36 percent,\u00a0are contained within the borders of a single county.\u00a0In less populated regions, a district must, of necessity, spread out to meet its population number. But, as the maps above show, that's not always the reason for the shifting lines.\u00a0\n\nThe\u00a0state's major cities are carved into all manner of peculiar bits and pieces to assemble state House, Senate and even Congressional\u00a0districts.\u00a0Fort Lauderdale and Orlando are each\u00a0divvied up into four congressional districts, often being grouped with smaller rural communities that share little common interest.\n\n\u00a0It is also clear that\u00a0the integrity of county lines is not a concern when district lines are drawn.\u00a0As we mentioned before, only one of the state's 25 congressional districts\u00a0is wholly contained in one county. Among the rest, one\u00a0includes some or all of\u00a016 counties,\u00a0and the\u00a0average\u00a0number of counties per district is 4.8.\u00a0Miami-Dade and Broward counties are in five congressional districts. Hillsborough, Pinellas and Duval\u00a0counties are in three. \u00a0\n\nThe state House and Senate are not much better.\u00a0In the House,\u00a059 -- slightly less than half\u00a0-- of the\u00a0districts fall within one county. One district\u00a0takes in portions of 10 counties, and the average number of counties included\u00a0wholly or partially\u00a0in\u00a0a state House seat\u00a0is\u00a01.96.\u00a0Only seven of the 40 state Senate seats\u00a0fall within one county,\u00a0and on average,\u00a0senate districts\u00a0spread over three counties.\n\nWhat about the claim that districts \"go for 150 to 200 miles?''\n\nMany do, as our rough approximations illustrate.\u00a0Strictly speaking, there are not \"dozens'' that run over 150 miles, but there are at least nine on our list, and if you loosen the standard\u00a0slightly to take in those over 140 miles, we found 13. One might argue that districts\u00a0should be measured not just from end to end, but by the sprawling\u00a0territory they take up, which would\u00a0likely add to the list. Whether it would get it to \"dozens'' is debatable.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nInarguably, the districts\u00a0meander and wind in jagged jigsaw patterns that crisscross cities and\u00a0 counties.\u00a0We\u00a0highlighted more than three-dozen examples. With a slight penalty for fuzzy math on the number of giant districts,\u00a0we rate Freidin\u2019s claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13845"}
