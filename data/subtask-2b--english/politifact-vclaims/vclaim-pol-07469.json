She became CEO of Points of Light Foundation, the service-oriented organization inspired by President George H.W. Bush, in 2007. Nunn is on leave while campaigning.\nEnding Spending Action Fund, a political action committee founded by Joe Ricketts, former CEO of TD Ameritrade, has spent more than $1 million on Nunn attack ads since April.\nEnding Spending president Brian Baker told PolitiFact Georgia last month that the group opposed two candidates this year, Nunn and Republican U.S. Rep. Phil Gingrey. Both jumped in the race to replace retiring U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Georgia, but Gingrey was knocked out in the crowded GOP primary that Perdue ultimately won.\nIn July, PolitiFact Georgia rated as Mostly True an Ending Spending ad claim that Nunn earned as much as $300,000 from Points of Light after the non-profit had laid of 90 workers (due to a merger). \u00a0\nThe contest between Nunn, daughter of retired U.S. Sen. Sam Nunn, and Perdue, cousin of former Gov. Sonny Perdue, is one of the most closely watched of this year\u2019s elections.\nThe prospect of Democrats winning a Senate seat in Republican-controlled Georgia is energizing for Nunn and her party. They want to reclaim a Georgia Senate seat and keep control of the Senate chamber for the last two years of President Barack Obama\u2019s term. Republicans need six seats to claim the Senate majority.\nFor our fact-check of the newest ad from Ending Spending, we contacted Baker, asking for evidence to back up the ad\u2019s claims. He sent us a document based largely on the Nunn campaign\u2019s 144-page internal memo and a story in National Review, the conservative magazine that broke the story of the leaked memo.\nOn July 28th, National Review Online reported that Points of Light had made grants totalling more than $33,000 to Islamic Relief USA, one of a global network of charities that\u2019s under the umbrella of Islamic Relief Worldwide.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeremy \"Spike\" Cohen\n\n\nstated on January 22, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays the Biden administration labeled Libertarians terrorists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Czopek \u2022 January 22, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn June, Israel\u2019s defense minister labeled Islamic Relief Worldwide an \"unauthorised association\" and has prevented the group from operating in Israel and the West Bank, citing its links to the Palestinian and U.S.-designated terrorist group Hamas..\nIn a web posting, officials with Islamic Relief Worldwide said the organization \"is extremely surprised and concerned by this and categorically denies any links with Hamas.\"\nStefanie Weiss, Points of Light\u2019s \u00a0communications director, told us the nonprofit \"has never had any dealings with or given any grants to Hamas or any known terrorist group.\"\nFrom 2003 to 2011, MissionFish was a Points of Light business unit that allowed eBay sellers and buyers to direct all or part of the proceeds from a transaction to their favorite charity, Weiss said.\nEBay users could donate to any of 20,000 organizations, all of which were registered 501(c)(3) nonprofits or the overseas equivalent, she said.\n\"These nonprofits were vetted regularly to ensure tax-exempt status, good standing with the IRS, and exclusion from terrorist watch lists,\" Weiss said.\nIslamic Relief USA was one of them and \"remains an eBay Giving Works-approved charity,\" she said. (Points of Light sold MissionFish to eBay in 2011.)\nPoints of Lights\u2019 IRS 990s show Islamic Relief USA, which describes itself as an independent affiliate of Islamic Relief Worldwide, received about $13,500 in contributions from eBay buyers and sellers in 2006, 2007 and 2010. National Review has corrected its story to show that the $33,000 figure was in error.\nNathan Click, spokesman for the Nunn campaign, called the ad a \"false and ridiculous attack against Points of Light -- an organization founded by President George H.W. Bush that mobilizes million of volunteers each year.\"\nHe said this kind of attack \"is exactly what Georgians are ready to change about our political process.\"\nOur Ruling\nJust the mention of the word Islamic can ignite strong emotions in some people. And those working to block Nunn\u2019s candidacy clearly know that and hope the ad will work in their favor.\nOur research showed the group that Points of Light dealt with -- Islamic Relief USA -- is an approved charity and not on the U.S.\u2019s terrorist watch list.\nBut the record of its umbrella organization, Islamic Relief Worldwide, is not clear. Leaders of IRW deny any connection to Hamas. But a top Israeli official in June banned Islamic Relief Worldwide from working in the country, saying terrorist connections exist.\nThe ad says Nunn's foundation \"directed money.\" But Points of Light\u00a0 instead allowed eBay buyers and sellers to choose whether to take part in the program and then designate any one of 20,000 charities, including Islamic Relief USA, to get donated funds.\n\u00a0Donors\u00a0 gave to an entity that is not on the U.S. government\u2019s terrorist watch list. These type of donations started before Nunn arrived at Points of Light, and the nonprofit sold MissionFish, three years before the Israel government banned the umbrella group.\nEnding Spending Action makes a very specific claim based more on innuendo than evidence.\nWe rate it Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07469"}
