Previous barriers built on the southern border had been successful. In tweeting, Capito said, \"We started in the early 1990s, we built barriers in four sectors on our southern border. Since their respective construction, there has been a dramatic decline in the fears of people crossing the border illegally. Let us recognize that physical barriers must be part of the solution.\" A chart attached to the tweet said that there was a 90 per cent decrease in the Toxone sector, 95 per cent in the Yumah sector, 95 per cent in the San Diego sector and 95 per cent in the El Paso sector. From the early 1990s, we built barriers in four sectors on our southern border. Since their respective construction, there has been a dramatic decline in the fears of people crossing the border illegally. Let us recognize that physical barriers must be part of the solution. ==External links==Pic.twitter.com/obJzvtlTX - Chile Moore Capito (@Sen Capito) 30 January 2019 did barriers in four sectors of the south-west border lead to dramatic reductions in fears? We've had a good look. The evidence of Cabito Taylor Hern\u00e1ndez, Director of Communications of Cabito, refers to the Ministry of Internal Security's \"Border Security Report\" of 1 May 2018. This report contained data dating back to 2006, but we were able to find additional data on the customs and border protection website. (At the same time, the fact-finding site Snopes.com noted that statistics originated from the National Commission of the Republic. In this graph showing the directional lines of border concerns -- the typical method of measuring illegal migration to the United States from the southern border -- dates back to 1990, the period to which Cabito had indicated in her tweeting. In general, the graph shows a downward trend in concerns in various sectors, which were halted by a sharp rise in around 2004 and 2006. This means that over the past 20 years, there has been a decline in cross-border migratory flows. Tucson fell by 92 per cent of its peak in 2000, fell one day by 70 per cent of its peak in 2005, and San Diego fell by 93 per cent of its peak in 1992, and El Paso fell by 89 per cent of its peak in 1993. However, these significant reductions began between 1992 and 2005 - before the adoption of the Public Security Act 2006. The Act, signed by President George W. Bush, authorized the establishment of a fence some 700 miles along certain parts of the southern border. This fence was built over several years after the promulgation of the law, depending on the sector. If measured, the decreases between the law that entered into force in 2006 and 2018, are still significant, but not as large as the decreases that occurred before 2006. The percentage of El Paso fell by 74 per cent, that of San Diego by 73 per cent, that of Tusson by 87 per cent and that of a day by 78 per cent. These percentages are all smaller than Capito wrote on Twitter. It is also important to note that some of the border crossings may have moved from urban areas, where walls were constructed, to more rural areas, as Tony Bayan, a colleague of Mexican studies at Rice University, said. On February 1, 2021, Tom Cotton mentioned in an interview with Fox and friends \"Many of these arriving immigrants, we have no way of checking their background for either health or security.\" \u2022 3 February 2021 \"Some barriers have risen, primarily along urban areas, such as San Diego and El Paso,\" he said. \"But these barriers have not stopped undocumented migration at all. They simply delivered it to areas beyond urban areas.\" In fact, the total statistics on receipts at the south-western border were lower than those for some relatively urban sectors mentioned by Cabito. Overall, concerns on the south-west border, including areas not highlighted by Cabito, declined by 76 per cent from their peak in 2000 to 2018, and by 63 per cent between 2006 and 2018. This decline is less dramatic than the one witnessed specifically by El Paso, San Diego and Tusson, and by Cabito. The sectors chosen by Cabito are therefore somewhat selected from cherry. Finally, immigration experts say that security measures are not attributable to all - but to most - of the decline in border crossing. Douglas Massey, Professor at the Bureau of Population Research at Princeton University, who studied cross-border migration for decades, has already told Polyte Fructte that he considers the economy to be the main factor. The Great Recession had had a tremendous impact in slowing border crossings. In particular, the diminished prospects for finding employment in sectors such as construction, which usually attract a disproportionate number of Latinos, has weakened the desire for potential Mexican migrants to make a difficult journey. Payne agreed that barriers would not have been the only factor. \"Though enforcement and obstacles were more stringent,\" said Bayan, \"other factors played a role, including the demographic change of Mexico, the rise of the middle class, and the publication by the United States of more stringent cheques, such as electronic verification,\" an electronic employment verification system. \"Everything helps, but it is quite misleading to attribute the decline in undocumented crossings to barriers, especially at that early time,\" said Bayan. The Cabito Office of Poletti Fuckett repeated its tweet that \"physical barriers must be part of the solution\" rather than the only part. Our governor Capito said, \"In the early 1990s, we built barriers in four sectors on our southern border. Since their respective construction, there have been dramatic reductions in the fears of people crossing the border illegally, including a 90 to 95 per cent decrease in the Toxone, Yuma, San Diego and El Paso sectors. The four sectors I mentioned fell significantly after peaking in the 1990s and early in the first decade of the twenty-first century, but not to the extent I indicated. And the rest of her assertions are questionable. The reduction of border controls began before the enactment of the 2006 law authorizing the border fence. Moreover, while these barriers may have an impact, other factors, particularly the troubled economy after the major recession, are often attributed to a key role in reducing border concerns. We're mostly assessing the statement wrong.
