And once again, we\u2019ll repeat: Most studies and experts say it\u2019s not.\nDuring a debate televised on 6ABC on Oct. 16, Republican candidate for Pennsylvania attorney general and state Sen. John Rafferty was in the process of bolstering his calls for a statewide voter ID provision when he implied \"illegal\" voting in Pennsylvania is widespread.\n\"Recently though, the media has reported on thousands of illegal voters here in the commonwealth,\" he said during the debate. His opponent, Democratic candidate and Montgomery County Commissioner Josh Shapiro, shot back \"That\u2019s just simply not true\" to which Rafferty responded: \"Read the papers.\"\nConcerns about voter fraud and illegal voting in Pennsylvania have been a major concern this election, especially as GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump has circulated factually inaccurate claims about voter fraud in Philadelphia. So we decided to check Rafferty\u2019s claim.\nHis campaign provided\u00a0PolitiFact\u00a0with three citations to back up his claim that the media has recently reported on \"thousands\" of instances of illegal voting in the commonwealth. The first wasa nearly two-year-old report in the\u00a0Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, which reported that more than 700 Pennsylvanians may have cast two ballots or voted elsewhere in the 2012 general election. In that year, about six million votes were recorded in Pennsylvania, meaning those 700 votes would have accounted for less than 0.0001 percent of the vote. President Obama won the state by 300,000 votes.\nThe story cited Carol Aichele, Pennsylvania\u2019s former Secretary of State and a proponent of the implementation of voter ID laws. (She oversaw its passage in\u00a0Pennsylvania and testified in the trial that ultimately led to the state Supreme Court ruling the measure unconstitutional.) At the time, Aichele told the newspaper that more than 700 Pennsylvania voters had the \"potential\" to cast two ballots in the election.\nExperts say double voting is actually quite rare.\u00a0A report by the nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law\u00a0noted that accusations of widespread double voting are often couched with a \"might\" and are probably more common than actual double voting.\n\"These cases are extremely rare \u2014 not because such documentation is hard to come by (many states require that such documents be retained), but because actual double voting is itself extremely rare,\" author Justin Levitt wrote in the report. \"Moreover, the scarcity is expected, given the severity of the penalty (criminal prosecution), and the meager nature of the payoff (one incremental vote).\"\nThe second media report cited by the Rafferty campaign was a January story by\u00a0The Philadelphia Daily News\u00a0about three former Philadelphia elections officials pleading guilty to violating the state election code. The story refers to two separate examples of voter fraud. The first was a case of a poll worker who cast a vote for her 23-year-old son in the 2015 primary. The second stemmed from the 2014 primary, in which the defendant voted for her mother.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe final citation provided by the Rafferty campaign was\u00a0a\u00a0New York Times\u00a0story detailing a fraud scheme in Philadelphia\u00a0that encouraged hundreds of voters to cast absentee ballots even though they didn\u2019t have a legal reason to. The story was from February 1994.\nThose examples don\u2019t add up to \"recent\" media reports about thousands of voters casting illegal ballots in Pennsylvania.\u00a0PolitiFact\u00a0was able to find two additional media reports that did cite \"thousands\" of illegal voters in Pennsylvania.\nThe first of those reports was an Oct. 11 report\u00a0titled \"Potentially Thousands of Illegal Voters in Pennsylvania\"\u00a0and was published by LifeZette, a website founded by conservative pundit Laura Ingraham. It cited an incident where mailers were sent to thousands of Pennsylvania voters \u2014 including, potentially, some undocumented immigrants \u2014 inviting residents to register to vote. It didn\u2019t actually register them.\nThe second report was published this week \u2014 notably after Rafferty made his claim during the 6ABC debate \u2014 and\u00a0was titled: \"Proof: Thousands of GOP votes likely stolen in Pa.\"\u00a0It was published by WorldNetDaily, a conservative news and commentary website founded by\u00a0Joseph Farah, a noted \"birther,\"\u00a0or person who believes President Obama was not born in the United States. That story\u2019s \"proof\" was a widely-debunked theory about 2012 voting in Philadelphia.\nElections officials in Pennsylvania say widespread illegal voting is often cited during contentious elections and conversations about implementing voter ID requirements but isn\u2019t particularly common. A 2012 report on voting irregularities in Philadelphia suggests\u00a0most are a result of clerical errors.\nOur Ruling\nDuring a 6ABC debate, candidate for attorney general John Rafferty said \"Recently though, the media has reported on thousands of illegal voters here in the commonwealth.\"\nTo back up that claim, the campaign provided three citations: One of which was 22 years old and not recent, one that was related to instances of voter fraud that netted an additional two votes and one that suggested about 700 voters had the \"potential\" to vote twice, but there wasn\u2019t evidence those individuals actually did.\u00a0Those do not add up to the media \"recently\" reporting on \"thousands\" of instances of illegal voting.\nWe rate the claim Pants on Fire.\nThis article\u00a0was corrected to reflect that\u00a0in\u00a0the 2012 general election 700 votes would have accounted for less than 0.01 percent of the vote.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04052"}
