When pressure was put on the social security office to say how much the comprehensive government health insurance programme would cost, the democracy in New Jersey answered a different question. \"Even the Congressional Budget Office says if you cut medical care to allow 50 years of age to get it, you can not only save government money, but you can cut premiums for all Americans,\" said CBS news poker in February 4. There is no such report on civil society organizations. We reached out to the Booker office, and the staff told us that he was drawing an article in health affairs in the year 2017 floating around the idea of compulsory registration in medical care when people were 55 years old and not 50 years old, as Booker said. Nor did the article predict the savings that Booker described. Insurance markets are not simple. Yes, the withdrawal of persons aged 55 to 64 from the private market would leave behind a younger and healthier population, leaving room for lower premiums. Yes, placing the same age group in medical care would reduce the average cost per person in medical care. However, the Government still has to pay for the care received by those aged 55 to 64. As costs rise, Washington will need new revenues. On January 13, 2021, General David H. Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for the use of marines for security, saying, \"We don't work for you.\" By Samantha Buterman: January 17, 2021, the article said, \"The cost of medical care at age 55 must be borne by the younger population.\" She proposed an increase of 1 per cent in the salary tax, plus an additional charge to employers who provided insurance to their employees. Trisha Newman, Director of the Kaiser Medical Care Policy Program, said that the detection of the total impact on government spending becomes more complex when affordable care and expanded medical aid policy subsidies are taken into account. \"This will depend on a change in average spending for those aged 50-64 in the market compared to medical care, fewer people receiving subsidized market coverage, and fewer people receiving coverage through the expansion of Medicaid. Newman is not aware of a full estimate of the net cost. By the way, current proposals to open the medical care system for persons as young as 50 years of age offer early registration as an option. The article on health matters spoke of making it compulsory at age 55. Our governor, Boker, said that the Bureau reported that allowing 50-year-olds to have access to medical care would save government money and reduce premiums for everyone. The Office of the Senator acknowledged the absence of such a report from community-based organizations. The article behind the Booker statement discussed a different idea: making the transition to medical care compulsory for 55 and more people. While he said that there would be some subsequent savings, he also said that there would be higher costs, and he did not try to say what the net effects were. We value this allegation wrong.
