Fast forward to today, and access to abortion is still a hotly debated issue.\nSen.

The group first outlined the differences in abortion restrictions by year in a report released Jan. 2, 2014.\nCounting different provisions in the same bill independently, the group tallied 205 new abortion restrictions during the period 2011 to 2013, compared to 189 during the 10 years through 2010. Now, out of the 205 restrictions, there are 25 not currently in effect, either because a court struck them\u00a0down or a court case is pending.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

(Using the Guttmacher data, the Washington Post made their own handy breakdown of abortion restrictions by state.)\nFor perspective, in 2000, Guttmacher considered the two most restrictive states to be Utah and Mississippi, both of which had restrictions on\u00a0the books in five of the institute's 10 categories. By\u00a02013, 22 states had five or more restrictions. Louisiana had restrictions in all 10 categories.\nMethodological differences mean there\u2019s room for debate over the exact number of restrictions, even among abortion-rights groups.\nWhile Guttmacher reported 205 abortion restrictions over the last three years, the Center for Reproductive Rights counted approximately 130, said Amanda Allen, the center\u2019s state legislative counsel. That\u2019s because the Center for Reproductive Rights counted each bill just once, regardless of how many different provisions it may have included. The center hasn't been tracking the legislation since 2000, so they don't have a comparable number to pit against Guttmacher's 189 from that decade.\nWhile both groups that compiled the numbers are pro-abortion-rights, their figures aren\u2019t being contested by the Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion group. A spokeswoman for the Susan B. Anthony List told PolitiFact that the Guttmacher study \"certainly appears to be accurate.\"\nOur ruling\nMurray said there have been more state-level abortion restrictions in the past three years than in the 10 years before that. A Guttmacher Institute report counted 205 restrictions from 2011 to 2013, compared to 189 from the previous decade. It's worth noting that 25 of those aren't currently in effect, but Murray specifically referred to\u00a0restrictions enacted, not restrictions currently enforced.\u00a0Both abortion-rights advocates and anti-abortion advocates told PolitiFact that they concur with Guttmacher's\u00a0data.\u00a0We rate her claim True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08356"}
