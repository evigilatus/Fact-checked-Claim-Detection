More to the point, it is too soon to say that the U.S. response to Irma was the largest response to a hurricane, and it definitely was not the first time an aircraft carrier was deployed for that reason.\nMilitary response to Hurricane Irma is significant, but it\u2019s too soon to say it\u2019s the largest ever\nHurricane Irma struck the U.S. Virgin Islands as a Category 5 storm\u00a0and skirted along Puerto Rico\u2019s coast with 185 mph winds. The storm continued on a track towards Florida, where it hit the Keys as a Category 4 hurricane in the Florida Keys and then again on Marco Island as a Category 3. The storm caused major, widespread damage from Miami to Naples to Tampa and Jacksonville.\nIn response to Irma, the Defense Department said on Tuesday that it had dispatched 10,000 service members to the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, and 20,700 in the eastern United States.\nThe National Guard reported Sept. 12 that it had deployed more than 15,500 guardsmen in response to Irma. In addition to service members, the Pentagon has deployed nine ships and the USS Abraham Lincoln, a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier controlled by the Navy.\nThese numbers could change as the department assesses what is needed. \u00a0\nStill, by numbers alone, the response to Irma at the time of this claim doesn\u2019t quite stack up against the Pentagon\u2019s response to Hurricane Katrina.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Sept. 7, 2005, nine days after Katrina made landfall, operations included 17,417 active-duty troops, 42,990 National Guardsmen, 20 U.S. ships, 360 helicopters and 93 military planes, according to a Congressional Research Service report.\n\"Whether the Irma efforts become the largest deployment of U.S. military forces after a natural disaster remains to be seen, but it\u2019s worth noting that more than 12,000 Department of Defense personnel assisted with Unified Assistance, and thousands were deployed after Hurricane Katrina,\" said Lance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University.\nMore broadly, if you consider all naval and Marine operations (not just hurricane relief), then Bossert\u2019s claim is even more inaccurate.\n\"Clearly this was nowhere near the biggest naval/Marine operation ever\u2014it was dwarfed by big wartime operations from World War II and the Korean war and even Operation Desert Storm,\" said Michael O\u2019Hanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.\nIs this the first time the United States has deployed an aircraft carrier?\nThe Navy Office of Information confirmed that this was not the first time an aircraft carrier has been deployed to help hurricane recovery efforts.\nAfter Hurricane Katrina, the USS Harry S. Truman deployed\u00a0for\u00a0rescue and recovery operations.\nIn addition, the USS Saipan was deployed after Hurricane Hazel in 1954. And it\u2019s not only hurricanes. In 1959, the USS Kearsarge deployed to Japan to help with relief efforts related to Typhoon Vera. The USS Abraham Lincoln was also sent to Sumatra to provide support for Indonesia after the 2004 tsunami.\n#70YearsOfService 1959: USS Kearsarge responds to #Typhoon Vera in #Japan w/ airlifts & #SearchAndRescue ops.

At this point, the response to Irma doesn\u2019t quite stack up against the Pentagon\u2019s response to Hurricane Katrina.\nWe rate this claim Mostly False.\n Share the Facts 2017-09-14 15:10:38 UTC   PolitiFact    3 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly False  https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/09/11/press-briefing-pressecretary-sarah-sanders-and-homeland-security-advisor The mobilization of the military in response to the storms in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands \"is the largest ever mobilization of our military in a naval and marine operation\" and an Air Force carrier there \"was the first-ever as well.\"    Tom Bossert homeland security adviser    in a White House press briefing Monday, September 11, 2017 2017-09-11    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02911"}
