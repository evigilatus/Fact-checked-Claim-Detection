We also searched for it in Google and the Nexis database and found no mention of the quote \"people are dying who have never died before.\"\nAccording to multiple biographies, author Ernest Hemingway reportedly enjoyed using the phrase, but it isn\u2019t clear whether he was the one who coined it.\nEither way, Trump didn\u2019t say it and neither did Biden.
