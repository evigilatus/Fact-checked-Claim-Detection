Texas is one of 14 states that has not opted to expand Medicaid.\nState Rep. John Bucy III introduced the amendment and said Texans are losing out on quality health care by not expanding the insurance program.\n\"Right now, 1 in 4 Texas women of reproductive age are uninsured, totaling 1.5 million Texas women,\" said Bucy, a Democrat who represents a portion of Williamson County. \"While many of these women qualify for health care coverage during pregnancy, they lose that care shortly thereafter. It is critical that we increase access to health care for women before, after and between pregnancies by expanding Medicaid.\"\nBucy shared the same claim about uninsured women in a post on Twitter during the debate. So we had to ask, are there really that many Texas women without health insurance?\nState agencies don\u2019t track this number\nAllison Heinrich, Bucy\u2019s legislative director, said the statistic came from a letter an advocacy group sent to the Texas Senate\u2019s Health and Human Services Committee in September.\nThe letter states that 1 in 4 Texas women between the ages of 15 and 44 are uninsured.\nThe letter \u2014 sent by a coalition of organizations advocating for better health care called Cover Texas Now \u2014 attributed the statistic to a series of reports from the Texas Department of State Health Services.\nLaura Guerra-Cardus of the Cover Texas Now coalition and the Children\u2019s Defense Fund said the citation in the letter was incorrect and that the group actually got this information from a 2016 report published by the left-leaning Center for Public Policy Priorities.\nThe report states that about 27 percent of women of childbearing age in Texas are uninsured.\nOfficials with the Texas Department of State Health Services, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission and the Texas Department of Insurance said their respective agencies do not track the uninsured population in Texas.\nCensus data backs up the claim\nThe report cited the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey and person-level data sets used by researchers. This information lets users examine\u00a0a sample of individual responses to the survey and extrapolate about things like the number of uninsured women in a particular age bracket.\nOliver Bernstein, spokesman for the Center for Public Policy Priorities, said researchers at the center plugged the data into statistical software to come to the conclusion that 1 in 4 women between the ages of 15 and 44 are uninsured in Texas, as of their 2016 report.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 2018 edition of the report came to the same conclusion.\nThis type of data analysis is common. The Urban Institute conducted a similar study of the uninsured population in Texas in December and they used this person-level data to identify the percentage of different population groups in Texas that are uninsured.\nThey didn\u2019t look specifically at uninsured women of reproductive age, but found that about 18 percent of all women in Texas are uninsured.\nThe Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that is pro-abortion rights, published a study in December that looked at the uninsured rate of women of reproducitve age using the same data.\nThe group's analysis found that, of the 5.9 million Texas women between 15 and 44, about 1.4 million (or 24 percent) are uninsured. This means about 1 in 4 women in this age bracket are without health insurance.\nPublished data from the Census Bureau (which has already been crunched) also supports Bucy\u2019s claim, although it doesn't consider the entire age bracket in question\u00a0.\nAge groupings for total population count and for uninsured women don\u2019t line up, so the most accurate group to analyze here would be women between 19 and 44, which doesn\u2019t include all women of reproductive age.\nThere are about 5.2 million Texas women between the ages of 19 and 44, the data shows. Of those women, more than 1.2 million do not have health insurance.\nThis means that about 1 in 4 Texas women between the ages of 19 and 44 do not have health insurance.\n\nOur ruling\nBucy said, \"one in four Texas women of reproductive age are uninsured, totaling 1.5 million Texas women.\"\nHis source was a report from an Austin-based group that conducted an analysis of Census numbers. The research method is one that has been used by other organizations and a study from the Guttmacher Institute had similar findings.\nAn analysis of publicly available Census numbers offers an estimate that also supports Bucy\u2019s claim.\nWe rate this claim True.\n\nTRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate and there\u2019s nothing significant missing.\n Share the Facts 2019-03-29 21:46:46 UTC   PolitiFact    6 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: True  \"Right now, 1 in 4 Texas women of reproductive age are uninsured, totaling 1.5 million Texas women.\"    John Bucy III State Representative http://tlchouse.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=45&clip_id=16809   the Texas House Wednesday, March 27, 2019 2019-03-27    Read More  info    \nCorrection: \u00a0This fact-check has been updated to address a mischaracterization\u200b\u00a0of the number of women who are uninsured.
