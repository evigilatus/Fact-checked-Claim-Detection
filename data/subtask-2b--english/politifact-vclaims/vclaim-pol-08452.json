We recently found progressive pundit Thom Hartmann talking about the health care law on RT, an English-language cable network funded by the government of Russia.\nHartmann, who hosts a show called The Big Picture, was discussing the decision of state lawmakers in 25 states not to expand Medicaid coverage as envisioned by the Affordable Care Act.\nHe said the decision was motivated by politics (most of the states that opted out of the expansion are run by Republicans), and that it hurts state taxpayers.\n\"When Rick Perry says to the people of Texas that he\u2019s not going to accept money from the federal government to pay for the expansion of Medicaid, what he\u2019s really saying, to his own people, the people of Texas, \u2018Naw, you can\u2019t have your own tax dollars back\u2019,\" Hartmann said.\n\"He\u2019s saying, \u2018No, you can't have your money back\u2019 because sabotaging the president is more important than letting you have affordable health care. And what\u2019s worse is, the people who live in states that aren\u2019t accepting the Medicaid expansion will still have the pay the taxes to foot the bill for the expansion in other states.\"\nWe wanted to explore Hartmann\u2019s argument that Republican state lawmakers have refused \"to give the people of their own states their own tax dollars back in the form of (expanded) Medicaid.\"\n(If you\u2019re interested in learning more about RT, formerly Russia Today, we suggest you start with this article from the Columbia Journalism Review.)\nTerms of Medicaid expansion\nMedicaid is a federal-state partnership to provide health care primarily to poorer Americans. The program is managed by states but funded through a combination of federal and state dollars. Who pays what varies, but generally the federal government contributes more than the states.\nWhile the health care law does not change the funding structure for people already enrolled or eligible to enroll in Medicaid, it does offer states a deal in exchange for adding new people to the system.\nFor new enrollees, the federal government would pay 100 percent of the costs for three years. (States would have to pay for some administrative costs.) After that, states would be asked to pay some costs, but never more than 10 percent.\nIf every state expanded its Medicaid program, the federal government would spend about $800 billion\u00a0 between 2013 and 2022, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. States would be on the hook for about $8 billion.\nLooking at the first three years\nAnalysts are more confident about how the deal between the participating states and Washington will play out during the first three years than they are beyond that. So we\u2019ll consider Hartmann\u2019s claim in two pieces.\nWe spoke to three experts who have looked closely at precisely the question of whether Medicaid expansion is a good move for the states. Their conclusions differ on the benefits overall, but during the first three years, they all agree. States come out ahead.\nJoe Antos, a health economist with the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington think-tank that generally criticizes the Affordable Care Act, does not believe expansion is a good idea in the long run. But simply in terms of dollars in and dollars out, the first three years are different for the participating states.\n\"They get money they wouldn't have gotten otherwise,\" Antos said. \"Some from their own citizens, some from citizens in other states.\"\nSherry Glied, dean of the Graduate School of Public Service at New York University agreed.\n\"States that are not participating are sending their taxpayers' money to leave the state without getting anything back in return,\" Glied said.\nStan Dorn, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, an academic research center in Washington, amplified Glied\u2019s point. The health care law is paid for by taxes and fees affecting wealthier households and players in the health care industry such as makers of medical devices and insurance companies. It also limits payments to doctors and hospitals.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The pain of the Affordable Care Act is locked in,\" Dorn said. \"The only thing you can change is the gain. If you implement the expansion, you get the full benefit.\"\nOur experts said Hartmann\u2019s claim would look differently if every state agreed to expand its Medicaid program, because some states would be \"winners\" and others would be \"losers\" based on how many people signed up.\nBut as things stand today, non-participating states are underwriting the cost of care in participating states.\n\"I suspect the people of Texas don\u2019t know that their tax dollars are going to places like Vermont or New York,\" Dorn said.\nBeyond the first three years\nSo experts agree that in the first three years, Hartmann is right: People in states that refuse to expand Medicaid will lose their share of tax dollars.\nBut what about in year four and beyond?\nMost states that have turned down the federal government\u2019s offer to expand Medicaid say they are worried about the out years when states must share some of the costs.\nBy saying no, some states might save their taxpayers some money.\nThat savings, however, is likely not enough in most cases to offset the contributions state taxpayers are sending to the federal government, two of our experts told us.\nExpanding Medicaid, for instance, will likely reduce other areas of state spending, particularly other health care programs the state operate. And in certain cases, the federal government plans on paying a larger share for the care of current Medicaid recipients.\nIn Virginia, analysts concluded that Medicaid expansion by itself would cost the state but the economic boost from the influx of federal dollars would more than offset those costs.\nAntos, who does not favor expansion, said the final tally whether the Medicaid expansion is a net benefit or cost will vary from state to state.\n\"It depends on the number and incomes of taxpayers in the state, the number of people who become eligible with the expansion who actually sign up, and the cost of services they use,\" he said.\nGlied led a group that focused on Medicaid expansion in a study for the Commonwealth Fund, a Massachusetts foundation that funds health policy research. Their conclusions suggested states would do well to participate.\n\"The state economy as a whole is always better off with the expanded program because state tax payments are never close to the federal Medicaid payment,\" Glied said.\nDorn worked on a report that looked at how 10 states assessed whether they should participate.\n\"In every state that did a detailed analysis, and there were six that did, they gained,\" Dorn said.\"But does that necessarily mean that every state would? No. It\u2019s a very state specific question.\"\nOur ruling\nHartmann said that by rejecting an expansion to Medicaid, Republican state lawmakers are not allowing their residents to get their own tax dollars back. That is most accurate for the first three years of the program when the federal government pays 100 percent of the cost of care for newly enrolled people. Beyond that point, the results could vary.\nWhile it is always true that wealthier taxpayers in all states pay into the program and that the only way to get some of that back is through participating in the expansion, that doesn\u2019t mean that in every state, the total tax burden due to Medicaid wouldn\u2019t rise over the long haul.\nThere is a body of studies that point to gains for the states, but a range of outcomes is possible. Hartmann did not address the longer term uncertainties.\nPunditFact uses predictions about the future very cautiously. We put more weight on what is known in the short term than what is projected many years out. In this case, the first three years clearly support Hartmann\u2019s claim and the period beyond that is subject to debate.\nWe rate the statement Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08452"}
