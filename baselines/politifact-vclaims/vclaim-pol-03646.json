He announced Gorsuch as that pick Jan. 31, 2017.\nTwo days later, Baldwin told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that she would support a filibuster to block the Gorsuch nomination, would vote against the Senate action required to block a filibuster and would vote against Gorsuch if he made it to a final vote.\nIs that consistent with her position on Garland\u2019s nomination that the Senate should vote for a nominee in a timely manner?\nWe thought that was a question for the Flip-O-Meter, which examines whether a politician has been consistent on an issue.\nNot all votes created equal\nThe Garland and Gorsuch nominations came up in dramatically different contexts \u2014 one a nominee late in a lame duck presidency, the other immediately after a highly divisive campaign.\nBaldwin \u2014 like most other senators \u2014 switched sides between the two nominees.\nIn an email, Baldwin spokesman John Kraus said the senator\u2019s position is consistent because she supported a hearing, a committee vote and a floor vote for both nominees.\nBut the voting claim isn\u2019t quite that simple.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiguring this out means diving into Senate rules of procedure.\nWhen the minority party filibusters an initiative, as many Democrats have pledged to do with the Gorsuch nomination, the majority party can force a vote through a procedure called cloture. This effectively ends the filibuster by limiting the debate to 30 more hours.\nFor cloture to pass, it must be supported by 60 of the 100 senators.\nThat creates a higher threshold for nomination.\nGorsuch would otherwise need only a majority to be approved \u2014 and the Republicans hold that majority. Cloture is unusual but not unprecedented, having been used four times for Supreme Court nominees since 1968.\nKraus said Baldwin is consistent because she \"supports\" a cloture vote, even though she would vote against Gorsuch in that vote.\nBut cloture is a maneuver executed by the majority party (Republicans in this case), so Baldwin\u2019s \"support\" for that is both unnecessary and irrelevant.\n(Cloture and the 60-vote threshold itself could also become irrelevant if Republicans choose to use what has been termed the \"nuclear option,\" a parliamentary procedure by which they can use majority votes to override the requirement for a supermajority, effectively overcoming a filibuster with just 51 votes. Democrats did this to push through Obama\u2019s lower court appointments in 2013, but it hasn\u2019t been used for a Supreme Court nominee.)\nBaldwin said during the Garland process the Senate should give him \"fair consideration,\" and she pledged the same thing to Gorsuch in a statement issued the day of his nomination.\nTwo days later she announced plans to vote against Gorsuch, before meeting with him or participating in any hearing process.\nGov. Scott Walker labeled Baldwin a hypocrite on Twitter for telling others to meet with Garland but deciding on Gorsuch before meeting with him.\nBut Kraus said Baldwin had reviewed the backgrounds and records of Gorsuch and other finalists before Trump\u2019s announcement.\nHe said that allowed time to give fair consideration before deciding she would oppose Gorsuch due to a \"record of ruling against disabled students, against workers and against women\u2019s reproductive health care.\"\nOur rating\nWhen Baldwin\u2019s party put forth a Supreme Court nominee, she advocated for a \"timely vote\" and an \"up or down vote.\" A common-sense interpretation is that she wanted a final nomination vote, where passing meant being approved by the Senate.\nBut now that Baldwin is in the minority and facing a Republican nominee, she is supporting a filibuster that creates a roadblock to reaching that final vote. Her claim to \"support\" a cloture vote makes no sense since that isn\u2019t up to her party \u2014 cloture would be pushed by Republicans and is only needed if Baldwin and other Democrats pursue a filibuster.\nAnd that cloture vote would only advance the process, not result in a final decision on Gorsuch.\nThat\u2019s what we call a Full Flop.
