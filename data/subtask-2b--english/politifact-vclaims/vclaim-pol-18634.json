It was initially called \"swine flu,\" because it carried genes similar to influenza viruses in North American pigs.\u00a0\nThe post cites an estimate from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of how many people H1N1 killed worldwide. During the debate, Biden was clearly citing the number of people who died from H1N1 in the United States, comparing it with the number of Americans who have died from the coronavirus under Trump\u2019s watch, which now stands at nearly 211,000, according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center.\nWhat\u2019s more, in his debate remarks Biden actually overstated the number of swine flu deaths in the U.S. while he was vice president. The CDC estimates that 12,500 Americans died from H1N1 between April 2009 and April 2010.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post reads, \"Joe said 14,000 people died from H1N1.
