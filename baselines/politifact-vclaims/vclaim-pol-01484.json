Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., touted a number of things his home state can be proud of.\n\"I'm from a little state, most patriotic state in the nation,\" Manchin told the crowd. \"More veterans per capita, fought in more wars, shed more blood, lost more lives ... than any state. On top of that we've done all the heavy lifting. We mined the coal that made the steel that built the guns and ships, built the factories, built the middle class that gave you the quality of life you have today.\"\nWas he right that West Virginia has \"more veterans per capita\" than any state?\nManchin\u2019s office did not respond to inquiries for this article, but we turned to data compiled by the U.S. Census Bureau. We found a chart ranking the states based on the number of veterans as a percentage of the state\u2019s civilian population age 18 and older. In this chart, West Virginia ranked 14th in the nation.\n\nHowever, the most recent data in this chart was from 2013, so we decided to look at any more recent data we could find.\nIn 2016, there were 145,171 veterans in West Virginia, according to Census Bureau data. That\u2019s just under 8 percent of the state\u2019s estimated population of 1,815,857. (For this calculation, we used total population rather than just civilians over 18.)\nWest Virginia\u2019s percentage was higher than the national percentage -- nationwide, veterans made up 5.7 percent of the population in 2016 -- but it ranked below a number of other states. In fact, West Virginia doesn\u2019t even make the top five:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Justice\n\n\nstated on July 27, 2020 in a press conference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWest Virginia is the state with the oldest population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Patrick Orsagos \u2022 July 29, 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 Alaska: 9.2 percent\n\u2022 Maine: 8.5 percent\n\u2022 Montana: 8.4 percent\n\u2022 Virginia: 8.2 percent\n\u2022 Wyoming: 8.1 percent\nOur ruling\nManchin said that West Virginia has \"more veterans per capita\" than any state.\nCompared to the nation as a whole, West Virginia\u2019s percentage of veterans is higher than average.
