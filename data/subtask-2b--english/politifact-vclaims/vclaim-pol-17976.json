Nancy Green, a Kentucky native and former slave, might have attained middle-class status in Chicago. But we found no evidence she was a millionaire when she passed away in 1923.\nQuaker Oats said it made its decision because the 130-year-old brand was based on a racial stereotype. Now comes a claim, in the form of two images, that an unidentified Aunt Jemima model worked while in chains.\nOne image appears to be a photograph of a woman holding a plate of pancakes with one of her ankles chained to the leg of a kitchen table. The second image appears to be the same photo, but cropped so that the woman\u2019s legs are not visible.\nThe post, with grammatical errors and misspellings, says:\u00a0\n\"This is why this was a huge issue to change the brand/name most ppl didn\u2019t understand. I don\u2019t givea a dayum if her worth was $18 trillion her leg is chained to a fkin table.

It is a self-portrait by Sally Stockhold, a white artist in Denver, portraying a version of Aunt Jemima in blackface.\nStockhold\u2019s website says \"Aunt Jemima \u2014 I laughed because they paid me,\" was published in 2008. It\u2019s listed in a category called, \"myselfportraits ode to icons and other absurdities.\"\nA 2013 Denver art website described Stockhold\u2019s work as \"part stage, part social commentary, playful but never frivolous.\"\nWe rate the post False.\nUpdate, June 30: We updated the description of Stockhold's artwork.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17976"}
