The Gates Foundation told us in an email that the post is false.\u00a0\nStill, we wanted to take a closer look.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 25, 2021 in a blog post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWHO now saying you do not need to wear a mask.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe source of the claim appears to be an April 7 Instagram post from Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the nephew of former President John F. Kennedy and one of the biggest sources of anti-vaccine advertisements on Facebook. The post was subsequently covered by the BL, a pro-Trump website that has been known to publish misinformation.\nWe found no credible news reports about\u00a0 496,000 paralyzed children in India due to a polio vaccine.\nThe Gates Foundation has long funded groups in India and elsewhere that seek to expand access to polio immunization. In March 2014, the World Health Organization declared that its Southeast Asia region was polio-free, in part because of the kinds of mass vaccination campaigns supported by the Gates Foundation. However, the virus remains a threat in South Asian countries like Afghanistan and Pakistan.\nAccording to the WHO, it is possible to contract polio from vaccines \u2014\u00a0but it\u2019s extremely rare. The agency estimates that 1 in 2.7 million oral doses results in vaccine-associated paralytic polio.\nSince the eradication of polio in India, there have been some scares of tainted vaccines. But data from the WHO show that, between 2000 and 2017, there were 17 cases of vaccine-derived poliovirus.\nThe Facebook post comes amid a rash of other conspiracy theories about Gates and his connection to the coronavirus pandemic. We\u2019ve fact-checked several false or misleading claims about the billionaire philanthropist, spanning from his purported financial interest in a COVID-19 vaccine to a bogus conspiracy about tracking Americans in lockdown.\nLike many of those claims, this Facebook post is inaccurate. We rate it False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16991"}
