Bush after Iraq\u2019s 1990 invasion of Kuwait: \"Remember, George, this is no time to go wobbly.\"\n\nIt evokes the image of a weak-spined Bush, bolstered by the Iron Lady.\n\nDick Cheney, the defense secretary who would become vice president, recently called it \"an old wives\u2019 story.\"\n\nAnd we said: Really?\n\nCheney fondly recalled the former British prime minister, who died Monday, in an interview that day with Fox News anchor Greta Van Susteren.\n\nVan Susteren: \"But there's that famous quote where, apparently, she told President Bush 41 not to go wobbly.\"\n\nCheney: \"That's not true.\"\n\nVan Susteren: \"That's not true?\"\n\nCheney: \"Not true, no.\"\n\nVan Susteren: \"That's a falsehood.\"\n\nCheney: \"An old wives' story. There was never any doubt about what the president was doing. He didn't need any bucking up.\"\n\nThe same day, the Christian Science Monitor published: \"Margaret Thatcher: 'This is no time to go wobbly' and other memorable quotes.\" The New York Times mentioned the line in her obituary.\n\nIs the quote just \"an old wives\u2019 story\"?\n\nBush and Thatcher\n\nWe\u2019ve reviewed speeches, transcripts, books and more, and we can tell you: Bush and Thatcher agree that she said it.\n\nBush himself publicly told the story in a 1991 speech as he awarded Thatcher the Medal of Freedom. He mentioned it in a 1998 book. She mentioned it in her 1993 memoirs and in a Frontline interview.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the popular account of her admonition that \"this is no time to go wobbly\" has taken on a life of its own \u2014 one doesn\u2019t match Bush and Thatcher\u2019s accounts.\n\nIn Bush and Thatcher\u2019s versions, it happened during a phone call three weeks after Iraq invaded Kuwait.\n\nThe leaders disagreed about how to respond to ships leaving Iraq in defiance of U.N. sanctions. The Bush administration, at the urging of U.S. Secretary of State Jim Baker, wanted to delay a few days to win support from the Soviet Union through the U.N. Security Council \u2014 a historic collaboration Baker later said marked the true end of the Cold War.\n\nThatcher, on the other hand, urged prompt action.\n\nBush says in his 1998 book she warned him \"this is no time to go wobbly\" around Aug. 22 as he explained why they would delay using force until they got specific authorization from the U.N. on Aug. 25. Thatcher says in her 1993 memoir she warned \"this was no time to go wobbly\" as he explained on Aug. 26 why, even with new U.N. authorization to enforce sanctions, they would let a ship through.\n\nBut some accounts place the quote earlier \u2014 on Aug. 2, the same day that Iraq invaded. That timing suggests Thatcher bolstered Bush\u2019s early response, such as his declaration Aug. 5 on the White House lawn that \"this will not stand, this aggression against Kuwait.\"\n\nIn one account, she made the remarks on Aug. 2 \u00a0in \"an aside at an Aspen Institute conference,\" as reported by the Christian Science Monitor.\n\nIn another, she made the comment on that same trip to Aspen, Colo., but in the vacation home of diplomat Henry Catto, according the New York Times, which cited Catto\u2019s autobiography.\n\nBut those accounts don\u2019t match the recollection of Philip Zelikow, a National Security Council staffer under Bush, or of Bush\u2019s national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, who spoke about it in 1996. Both were part of the Aspen trip.\n\n\"The \u2018wobbly\u2019 comment has indeed been widely misunderstood and long ago became a factoid,\" Zelikow told PolitiFact.\n\nZelikow, now a history professor and associate dean at the University of Virginia, recalled the encounter as part of an oral history project for the University of Virginia\u2019s Miller Center.\n\n\"I remember her using that line later in the context of arguments over the rules of engagement in the embargo and so forth,\" \u00a0Zelikow said in April 2000. \"There was an argument about whether we should be willing to fire on Iraqi ships, and there were a number of these fairly complicated conversations later in August and then in September.\"\n\nIn any telling, Thatcher warned Bush against wobbliness in August or September 1990. The precise date \u2014 and, especially, whether he needed such advice \u2014 is a matter of some dispute.\n\nBut by March 1991, the phrase had entered White House lore, the president himself said.\n\n\"Those who work with me in the White House know we use that expression often and have used it during some troubling days,\" Bush said in his medal speech for Thatcher. \"And never, ever will it be said that Margaret Thatcher went wobbly.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nCheney called \"that famous quote\" nothing but \"an old wives' story.\" But Bush and Thatcher themselves recount a phone call near the end of August 1990 in which Thatcher admonishes \"this is no time to go wobbly.\"\n\nPopular accounts of the \"wobbly\" quote shift the statement to the beginning of August, giving it an early starring role that several insiders dispute.\n\nInstead, Bush and Thatcher describe a later, narrower discussion about when and how to enforce U.N. sanctions. Still, they agree she made the comment, and Bush says it became a common expression around the White House. We rate Cheney\u2019s claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09486"}
