As it has risen to become the seventh-largest city in the United States, its leadership has used multiple approaches to tackle the water worries facing all of Texas, where the population is rocketing and the future looks dry.\nBut did 67 percent more customers settle in without using more water?\nBy phone, Puente said the percentages he aired \"need to be updated.\"\nThe water system\u2019s vice president for public affairs, Greg Flores, told us by email that Puente\u2019s rates covered 1984 through 2009. During that period, according to a chart Flores sent us, the population served by the utility rose from 800,627 to 1.34 million while water produced fell from 191,431 acre-feet to 186,112 acre-feet (an acre-foot is the amount needed to cover an acre to a depth of 1 foot, equal to 325,851 gallons).\nThat\u2019s a nearly 68 percent increase in population served and a 2.9 percent decrease in water produced.\nThen again, the cited period wasn\u2019t the latest 25-year time span when Puente spoke. Flores said the chart was generated from the utility\u2019s 2008 statistics.\nFlores sent a web link to the most recent edition, the utility\u2019s \"2011 Stat Book,\" and gave us the numbers for 2012, which we used to check the six most recent 25-year spans for which data is available. The 2012 data was not available when Puente spoke at the conference, Flores said, though data through 2011 was. \"Compilation of data for a particular year is typically not completed until the end of the following year,\" he said.\nThe 25-year spans showed fluctuations partly explained by the weather: Flores noted that 2011 was \"the single hottest, driest year in Texas\" and said water use remained atypically high through the 2011-13 drought. 2007 was a very wet year for San Antonio, he said.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n25-year span\n\n\nPopulation served\n\n\nAcre-feet used\n\n\n\n\n1987-2012*\n\n\nUp 55.2%\n\n\nUp 23.4%\n\n\n\n\n1986-2011\n\n\nUp 51.8%\n\n\nUp 21%\n\n\n\n\n1985-2010\n\n\nUp 55.6%\n\n\nUp 5%\n\n\n\n\n1984-2009\n\n\nUp 57.6%\n\n\nDown 0.6%\n\n\n\n\n1983-2008\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUp 59.9%\n\n\nUp 21.5%\n\n\n\n\n1982-2007\n\n\nUp 69.1%\n\n\nDown 7.3%\n\n\n\n\n*2012 data were unavailable when Puente made his claim.\nThe oldest span we checked, 1982-2007, showed more dramatic change than Puente\u2019s statement: 69 percent growth and a 7 percent drop in water use. But the most recent span for which data was available when he spoke, 1986-2011, saw a 52 percent increase in customers alongside a 21 percent increase in water used.\nThat\u2019s still not bad, a long-time Sierra Club leader told us by phone. \nKen Kramer, water resources chairman for Sierra\u2019s Texas chapter, told us, \"It\u2019s still very significant. Especially as compared to other major cities around the state. \u2026 It is great that San Antonio is doing this, and it does provide a model for other cities that haven\u2019t had that success yet.\"\nThe trend statewide is toward less water use, Kramer said. State and federal standards, with such requirements as water-efficient showerheads and toilets, have reduced Texans\u2019 per-person water use.\nTexas as a whole averaged out to about 151 gallons used per person per day in 2007-11, according to the Texas Water Development Board, with the state\u2019s nearly 26 million people using 169 gallons apiece a day during hot, dry 2011.\nFlores said, and the utility\u2019s stats confirm, that San Antonians reduced per-person water use from around 200 gallons a day in the 1980s (the utility\u2019s stats show the decade averaged out at 197 gallons per day, to be precise) to about 140 gallons a day now (2007-11 average out at 137 gallons per day).\nDaily water use per capita for 2011 in Texas\u2019 six largest cities shook out this way, according to the water board: Houston, 191 gallons; San Antonio, 148 gallons; Dallas, 197 gallons; Austin, 156 gallons; Fort Worth, 166 gallons; El Paso, 143 gallons.\nWhat got San Antonio saving? \"A big federal hammer,\" Puente told us.\n\"Back in the early 1990s, a federal judge actually was going to lay down pumping rules, limit our ability to pump water out of our aquifer, and gave us till the end of the legislative session to pass certain rules that we would impose on ourselves,\" he said.\nSan Antonio and nearby areas, he said, were hit by the federal deadline because of endangered species that relied on the Edwards Aquifer.\nFlores outlined some of the Alamo City\u2019s approaches:\n\n\nSmarter use of water pulled from the Edwards, including the nation\u2019s largest direct recycled water delivery system, routing treated wastewater to users such as golf courses, the River Walk and local industry.\n\n\nPumping all the Edwards water it\u2019s allowed to every year, and storing what it doesn\u2019t use in the Carrizo Aquifer -- which isn\u2019t porous like the Edwards, but hard-packed sand, Flores said. The Edwards water sits there, in fact barely commingling with the Carrizo water, and San Antonio has been extracting it as needed for the past three years. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nNew sources such as a $145 million desalination plant set to start tapping a deeper, saltwater aquifer in 2016.\n\n\nNot pumping as much water in the first place, aka conservation. The water utility educates users and subsidizes ways to use less, both in residential and commercial systems.\n\n\nFlores said the utility has approved conservation projects based on the $400 price to buy rights to an acre-foot of Edwards water for a year. If the project was cheaper than buying the water, the utility implemented the plan.\nGiving away 325,000 low-flow toilets, even hiring plumbers to help low-income residents install them, cost less than the unsaved water would have, Flores said. Same for helping Coca-Cola retool to clean bottles with pressurized air.\nLast year, though, mindful of the rising cost of water from the Edwards and other sources, the utility raised the ceiling: Now a project has to save more than buying the water at $1,100 per acre-foot, he said.\nOutdoor water usage, Puente said, is the next area of focus, with the utility offering rebates to water customers who want to convert a parched part of their lawn to a deck or patio.\nOur ruling\nPuente said San Antonio has seen \"67 percent growth in the last 25 years, 0 percent more water used.\"\nThose are cherry-picked, out-of-date stats, vintage 1984-2009. Up-to-date figures available when Puente spoke, covering 1986-2011, show that as the population served grew 52 percent, water usage increased 21 percent.\nSan Antonio may outpace other cities in water conservation. This claim still washes out as False.\n\nFALSE \u2013 The statement is not accurate.\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08390"}
