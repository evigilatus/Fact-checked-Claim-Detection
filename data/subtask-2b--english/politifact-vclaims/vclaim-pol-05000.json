Jerry Brown, perhaps tired of the job-poaching efforts of governors in Texas and Florida, shot back at Gov. Scott with claims that the Golden State\u2019s job picture is, well, very sunny.\n\"As one of the millions of tourists flocking to the Golden State this time of year, we\u2019d like to extend a warm welcome to (Florida Gov. Rick Scott). We can understand why he\u2019s coming back -- there\u2019s lots to do and plenty to learn,\" Brown said in a statement on April 26. His office issue a similar\u00a0press release a few days later.\n\"In fact, since his last 2,000 mile cross-country jaunt, California has added twice as many jobs as Florida, while paying down debt, building a robust rainy day fund and taking bold action on issues Governor Scott continues to ignore, like climate change and poverty,\" Brown said in the statement.\nFROM TWITTER\n\n\n.@JerryBrownGov to @FLGovScott: Time to stop the silly political stunts & start doing something about #ClimateChange pic.twitter.com/nuWwhEBu9I\n\u2014 Gov.

So we focused just on Brown\u2019s statement about California adding twice as many jobs as Florida, and whether there was any context missing. It turns out California\u2019s job picture is not really brighter than Florida\u2019s, at least not during the period Brown described.\n\u00a0\nFlorida Gov. Rick Scott speaks in 2015 / AP photo\n\u00a0\n\nOur research\nWe looked at data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics for the two states, from May 2015 to March 2016. Scott\u2019s first visit was in April 2015. Last month\u2019s data was not yet available.\nDuring this span, California added 354,100 jobs while Florida added 190,500 jobs. That\u2019s 1.86 times as many jobs as the Sunshine State -- not quite twice as many but pretty close.\nBrown\u2019s office also pointed to a slightly different time period, January through December 2015, when California added 1.97 times as many jobs as Florida.\nOf course, California is a much larger state with 39.1 million people -- almost double Florida\u2019s population of 20.3 million. One would expect California to add more jobs than Florida, to keep up with the millions more people who live here.\nFor some context, we checked the states\u2019 job growth rates during this period. Florida had a slightly faster job growth rate at nearly 2.4 percent compared with California\u2019s 2.2 percent.\nOur ruling\nGov. Jerry Brown said California has added twice as many jobs as Florida since that state\u2019s governor visited in April 2015 on a job recruiting tour.\nBrown's claim is close on the raw numbers. But it leaves out the important context that California is a much larger state that needs to add more jobs to keep its millions more people employed.\nThe federal jobs data show California added 1.86 times as many jobs as Florida during this period, a bit less than twice as many.\nCalifornia often leads the nation in overall job gains due to its sheer size. But the pace of that job growth tells a different story. Florida actually added jobs at a slightly faster rate, nearly 2.4 percent compared with California\u2019s 2.2 percent, during the period in question. That takes a lot of the shine off Brown's statement.\nWe rated his claim Half True.\n--------\nHALF\u00a0TRUE\u00a0\u2013 The statement is partially\u00a0accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.\nClick here for\u00a0more\u00a0on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.\n\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/84a7d7ae-cbfc-488f-a9b1-3f61c0f7069e", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05000"}
