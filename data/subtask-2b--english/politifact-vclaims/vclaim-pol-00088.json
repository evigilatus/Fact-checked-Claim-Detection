Clinton\u2019s impeachment charge stemmed from a sexual harassment case, in which Lewinsky, then a White House intern, became famously intertwined following an independent council\u2019s investigation into sexual encounters between Lewinsky and Clinton.\u00a0\nThe viral image in question displays Lewinsky\u2019s real Twitter profile picture and handle. It makes it look like she authored a tweet time-stamped at 6:06 p.m. on Oct. 3, with 1,610 retweets and over 18,000 likes, that read:\n\"I\u2019m willing to take one for (sic) team and give Trump a b****** in the oval office. Apparently, that\u2019s the only thing that can convince Republicans to impeach.\"\nThe screenshot was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

A visit to that Instagram profile shows the Lewinsky tweet and several other fabricated tweets and other memes. The same person\u2019s Twitter bio tells people to follow them on Instagram for \"original memes.\" In 2018, the user admitted to the Associated Press that he was responsible for creating a fake tweet made to look like it came from President Barack Obama\u2019s verified account.\nPolitiFact reached out to @electorotting but didn\u2019t immediately receive a response.\nThere is no sign of the tweet on Lewinsky\u2019s Twitter profile page. She tweeted multiple times on Oct. 3, but none mentioned impeachment or anything sexually suggestive.\u00a0\nWe also searched Lewinsky\u2019s Twitter handle @MonicaLewinsky in the All My Tweets database, which compiles users tweets in a single webpage, and could not find anything from Lewinsky on Oct. 3 \u2013 as the screenshot shows \u2013 that references impeachment, Trump or oral sex.\u00a0\nAnother red flag demonstrating that the tweet is fabricated: An advanced Twitter search of its keywords came up with (almost) no results. For a viral tweet that has supposedly garnered thousands of retweets and likes, only one similarly-worded tweet from a user who isn\u2019t Lewinsky showed up on the platform.\nWe reached out to Lewinsky for comment, but haven\u2019t yet heard back.\u00a0\nWe know enough, though, to rate this faux tweet Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00088"}
