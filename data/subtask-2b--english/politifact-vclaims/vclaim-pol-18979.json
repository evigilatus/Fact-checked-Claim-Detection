Every month we pull a birthday, sort the excess and snip some sacks, preferably in a big public gathering,\" reads the quote next to a picture of Jeong.\u00a0\nKolfage\u2019s Facebook post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nIn a caption accompanying the post, Kolfage drew a parallel between Jeong and the U.S. attorneys for the Southern District of New York who indicted him and three others on charges they defrauded donors to We Build the Wall, a nonprofit created to help fund construction of a wall along the Mexican border. \"She must be the script writer for SDNY investigations,\" Kolfage wrote. \"That indictment read like a NYT piece that was fully scripted.\"\nTo be clear: There is no evidence Jeong ever said this. Nowhere on social media has Jeong advocated for a \"castration lottery\" for white men. Nor has she written anything along those lines in her extensive body of work.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarly iterations of the fabricated quote shared by Kolfage appeared on 4chan in August 2018 along with a series of other posts falsely attributed to Jeong. On one of the threads in which it appeared, other 4chan users called the quote\u2019s veracity into question.\u00a0\nWhen Jeong joined the New York Times editorial board in August 2018, detractors surfaced a series of tweets dating back to 2013, which they claimed showed anti-white bias.
