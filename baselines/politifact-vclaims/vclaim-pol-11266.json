Joshua McKoon, by some accounts, committed political suicide this year.\n\nThe freshman Republican from Columbus proposed legislation to cap gifts from lobbyists to state lawmakers at $100. Statehouse leaders apparently didn\u2019t care for his approach, removing McKoon from a committee to study the idea. There\u2019s been mumbling, as one former senator put it, that Republicans were recruiting a candidate to run against McKoon.\n\n\"I have not been making a lot of friends inside the Capitol,\" McKoon said, when asked by PolitiFact Georgia about his proposal.\n\nThroughout the legislative session, McKoon attempted to buttress his argument with a fact to help fellow lawmakers see the light.\n\nGeorgia, he said, is one of three states that \"effectively have no regulations whatsoever on lobbyists giving to legislators.\"\n\nThe other states, he says, are Indiana and South Dakota.\n\nMcKoon held a news conference last month and pointed to a map of the United States with those three states in red. So, is McKoon correct?\n\nGovernment watchdog groups have argued ardently in recent years that Georgia needs to tighten its ethics laws and make it more difficult for lobbyists to influence state lawmakers with gifts of meals or trips. A recent joint report by the Center for Public Integrity and Global Integrity ranked Georgia last in the nation in the strength of its laws on public corruption and government openness. Some state lawmakers called the report biased.\n\nGeorgia code section 21-5-11 spells out the policy on gifts. It says that only statewide elected officials can accept gifts of more than $100 for a speech, seminar or panel discussion that directly relates to the duties of that official, but prohibits it otherwise. It states no rules for members of the Georgia Legislature or other types of gifts. \n\nA section on prohibited lobbying practices, Title 28, Chapter 7, mentions nothing about gift limits.\n\nThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution took a close look at lobbyists during the recent legislative session. A recent AJC story found lobbyists spent $866,747 --- the equivalent of $9,525 per day --- on gifts for lawmakers from Jan. 1 through March 31.\n\nMany of the gifts would have easily surpassed the $100 limit McKoon proposed. For example, the AJC found lobbyists took Rep. Mickey Channell, R-Greensboro, and his wife to dinner on Valentine\u2019s Day, spending about $230. Another House member, Rahn Mayo, D-Decatur, said he was unaware that the four Atlanta Hawks basketball tickets that lobbyists gave him cost about $500.\n\nHouse Speaker David Ralston has defended the current system, saying eliminating lobbying gifts would drive the practice \"underground,\" where the public would know less about what is happening between lawmakers and special interests.\n\nSo how does Georgia compare with other states when it comes to laws on gifts from lobbyists?\n\nThe National Conference of State Legislatures has a chart that examines gift policy in each state. McKoon said he used the NCSL chart to make his claim. Many states employ what\u2019s referred to as the \"cup of coffee\" policy, which prohibits any gifts whatsoever from lobbyists. About a dozen states set the limit at $100. Four states set the limit at $250. A handful limit gifts from lobbyists to between $250 and $1,000.\n\nThe NCSL chart says Indiana requires lobbyists to report gifts, but does not specify any limits of what they can give lawmakers. In 2010, state lawmakers changed some of the rules on gifts from lobbyists. They must now disclose any gifts in a day greater than $50. Before, the limit was $100, said Julia Vaughn, Common Cause Indiana policy director.\n\n\"We don\u2019t limit. We require some disclosure,\" Vaughn said.\n\nVaughn said some state lawmakers argue a gift ban isn\u2019t necessary because it\u2019s better for the public to know what they\u2019re getting from lobbyists.\n\nIn South Dakota, the code section on lobbyists mentions nothing about gift limits for lobbyists. The NCSL lists South Dakota as having \"no restrictions.\"\n\nWe found no discrepancies in the NCSL\u2019s research. The current laws in Georgia, Indiana and South Dakota afford lobbyists freedom to give state lawmakers as much as they want. We rate McKoon\u2019s claim as True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi bought $1.25 million in Tesla stock the day before Joe Biden signed an order \u201cfor all federal vehicles\u201d to be electric.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 February 2, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11266"}
