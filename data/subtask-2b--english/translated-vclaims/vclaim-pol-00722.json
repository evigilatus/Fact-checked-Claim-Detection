Very big, according to a recent article in World News. The article, published on March 30, 2019, quotes Nikki Bomar, spokesman for the West Virginia District Office of the United States Small Business Administration, saying: \"There are about 114,391 small businesses in West Virginia. Cumulatively, they account for 99 per cent of the total number of businesses in the State and employ 280,213 people - almost 50 per cent of the State &apos; s workforce.\" Last year, a prominent lawman in West Virginia, the Democrat Sin. Joe Manchen, distorted a relevant talking point, saying that small businesses \"are about 96% of our state economy.\" This statement was classified as mostly false (Bullift Vac). Manchen was wrong because he used the term \"economic\" which refers to all economic output in the State. While small businesses account for nearly 99 per cent of businesses in the State, small businesses account for only about half of workers in West Virginia. The other half of workers, who work for a small number of large companies, produce a disproportionate share of economic output because of their large workforce, as economists have told us. So did Bomar get it more accurately? Yeah, although the data is a little old. On January 16, 2021, Jordan Rachel stated in Tweedda that the minimum wage of $15 per hour would raise the price of taco bill burrito to $38. By Bill McCarthy: January 20, 2021, when we contacted Bomar, she sent us the same data that we used when we looked at Manchen's statement -- the Small Business Management Office for the 2018 Small Business Summary. The Bomar note in the newspaper was consistent with the data contained in the Agency's file. The only warning is that the data were collected in 2015. Small businesses arise and fail all the time, making the figures somewhat volatile. However, the data I have mentioned are the most recent available data. Our Governor Bomar said that small businesses in West Virginia make up \"99 per cent of the total number of businesses in the state\" and employ \"about 50 per cent of the state's workforce.\" This is true according to the latest data from the Federal Small Business Administration, although the data are somewhat outdated. We're mostly assessing it right.
