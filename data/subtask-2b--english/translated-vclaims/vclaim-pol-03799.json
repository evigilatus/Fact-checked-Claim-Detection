On January 11, 2017, Trump said that he had no financial relations or business dealings with Russia. He then rejected the concerns of a journalist who asked Trump whether he would release his tax returns to prove it. Trump said, \"I don't release tax returns because, you know, they're subject to audit.\" The reporter noted that the Presidents had been releasing their return since the 1970s. Trump cut her off and said, \"Oh, my God, I've never heard that before.\" \"You know, the only one who cares about my tax returns is journalists, okay? He said they were the only ones, saying he believed that the American public was not interested. \"I won; I mean, I became president. No, I don't think they care at all. I don't think they care at all. I think you care.\" The media invited Trump to release his revenues throughout his campaign, and appeals have increased since his election. Trump and his replacement provided countless excuses as to why he refused to release any information. But are they the only people who care if he does? The polling data consistently show that the majority of Americans in general want to know what's in Trump's tax records. It has been the common practice of decades for presidential candidates to release their tax returns. Despite Tramp &apos; s argument that he is not released because he is subject to audit, the IRS stated that he is allowed to release them whether or not they are subject to audit (as Richard Nixon did). Tax revenues show much more detail about the President &apos; s business dealings and financial background than, for example, the disclosure of campaign financing, which Trump offered as an alternative. This explains the interest of the media, which Trump attacked before. The Trump Transition Team did not expand its statement when we contacted them, but he was wrong when he said that the general public didn't care, in most polls. One of the polls conducted prior to the Trump Conference confirms that most Americans said that the returns should be released. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 On January 11, 2021, the Pew Research Centre released a new referendum in January 10, on the eve of the recent Trump press conference, which reviewed the feeling of voters. The survey showed that nearly two thirds of Americans believe the issue is important. The survey was conducted from 4 to 9 January between 1,502 adults with an error margin of 2.9 percentage points for the total sample. 60% of the people Pew interviewed said Trump was responsible for the public release of his tax returns. However, the numbers vary broadly according to political affiliation: 38 percent of Republicans or those who tend to Republicans agree that he is responsible, compared to 79 percent of Democrats or those who tend to the left. There was a lot of polling on this subject before the November 8. The way in which the questions were put varies from survey to survey, so it is difficult to compare the numbers directly. But in general, it shows that Americans believe that Trump's tax revenues are a serious issue. In a referendum held on 25 August 2016 by the University of Kuenyebek, he showed that 74 per cent of all voters said that Trump should release his tax returns publicly. This figure dropped only slightly among Republicans, 62 per cent of whom said they should be released. A polling at the University of Monmouth the same week said that 62% of Americans thought it was important for them to release their tax returns from presidential candidates. A survey of Fox News released in September 7 showed that 60% of voters, including 36% of Republicans and 83% of Democrats, thought Trump was hiding something in his tax returns. On 21 September, a survey of NBC/Wall Street Journal showed that 52 per cent of voters were concerned about the non-release of their tax returns. The choice was among several options relating to the areas of interest of voters to both Tramp and Clinton. \"Trumbe comments and languages on women, immigrants and Muslims\" were the first concern of 69 per cent, and \"Trump does not have the mood to be a general leader\" was the second of 66 per cent. Also, \"Trumbe's praise for Vladimir Putin\" was also of greater interest, 59 per cent. One of these exceptional cases was when Fox News asked the voters in a poll on 27-29 September whether \"the fact that Donald Trump didn't release his tax returns bothered you, or whether it wasn't a big deal?\" 46% of respondents said, \"They bother me,\" while 52% said, \"It's no big deal.\" But even those numbers show that half the Americans were worried that Trump didn't release his tax returns. Our referee Trump said that Americans don't \"take care at all\" of his tax revenues. Several opinion polls, including one issued the day before his last press conference, show that a large part of the public believes that Trump's tax returns are important. These polls describe their questions differently, but most of the results have shown that the majority of Americans believe that the issue is relevant, undermining Trump's assertion that only the media wish to explore this issue. We also appreciate Trump's false establishment. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9c5fd034-a5d4-4f80-96a0-0cedc9ee06ac", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03799"}
