The testimony was part of a pending racial discrimination and sexual harassment lawsuit that a former manager of one of her restaurants filed against Deen and her brother, Earl \"Bubba\" Hiers.\n\nSince the revelation, several companies have cut ties with Deen, including Target, Smithfield Foods and Atlanta-based Home Depot. On the other hand, Deen\u2019s fans have rallied around her, and Deen is still a draw in her hometown of Savannah. \u00a0\n\nTo counter critics claiming that Deen is racist, political commentators have noted her supposed support of President Barack Obama.\n\n\"Did (Deen) refuse to hire blacks? Has she mistreated them or paid them below the wages of white workers?\" conservative radio host Larry Elder wrote recently in an op-ed posted on Investors.com (Investors Business Daily). \"And, for what it\u2019s worth, Deen supported and campaigned for Barack Obama.\"\n\nElder\u2019s claim about Deen\u2019s political affiliation was the latest we\u2019d seen. But the claim has been picked up by various media outlets, including The Daily Caller, Breitbart.com and Naked DC.\n\nMany celebrities decline to get publicly involved in partisan politics. We wondered whether Deen had actually bucked that trend, so we decided to investigate.\n\nWe sought comment from Deen, but her publicist was unable to provide one.\n\nPolitiFact Georgia checked with Elder, and through his producer we learned that the source for his Deen claim was an article last month on the conservative website Breitbart.com. That article references an Us Weekly entertainment magazine slideshow of celebrities and their political affiliations. In fact, most of the outlets that have reported a Deen-Obama connection have relied on the Us Weekly item as their source for information.\n\nThe magazine\u2019s online slideshow, produced in October, features about 40 celebrities (including such famous faces as Oprah, Kevin Bacon, Chuck Norris and Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson), the party they support and a short write-up of their political involvement.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on February 7, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Satan flashed in the halftime Super Bowl satanic ritual.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 February 8, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of the information includes quotes directly from the celebrities about their party affiliation. But the basis for other items is not so clear. For example, wrestler Hulk Hogan\u2019s description says he is \"reportedly\" a registered Democrat. And the magazine lists porn star Jenna Jameson as a Republican, with this quote she gave CBS News: \"I'm very much looking forward to a Republican being back in office. When you're rich, you want a Republican in office.\" \u00a0But that statement doesn\u2019t necessarily equate to Jameson being a Republican.\n\nFor Deen\u2019s description, the magazine says she campaigned for Obama back in 2008 and invited first lady Michelle Obama to cook with her on an episode of \"Paula\u2019s Party.\" The write-up goes on to say that Deen later said she \"just loved\" being around Michelle and praised the first lady for her healthy eating and exercise platform.\n\nWe contacted Us Weekly, but it was unable to provide any information on the source for its political listing for Deen. But let\u2019s break down Deen\u2019s description.\n\nDeen did have Michelle Obama on her show for a segment in September 2008. The pair fried shrimp. But Deen also invited then-Republican presidential challenger John McCain\u2019s wife, Cindy, as well as McCain\u2019s running mate, Sarah Palin, to appear in a segment. Neither McCain nor Palin appear in the show credits from September 2008 to the end of that year.\n\nAt the time of the Obama invitation, Deen\u2019s publicist made sure to note that the invite was simply an invite and not an endorsement of Obama\u2019s campaign.\n\nPresident Obama did visit Savannah in March 2010 on a four-hour jaunt focused on jobs and energy efficiency. He did stop for lunch, but not at Deen\u2019s Lady and Sons restaurant, nor her brother\u2019s place. Instead, Obama ate at Mrs. Wilkes\u2019 Boarding House Restaurant, which also features Southern cuisine.\n\nWe also checked out Deen\u2019s alleged support through either her checkbook or her vote, and we came up empty. A search of the federal campaign database doesn\u2019t turn up any campaign contributions to Obama by Deen, her husband, Michael Groover, or under the name of Paula Groover. And a look at the Georgia voter rolls shows that Deen voted in the 2008 general election but does not show her party affiliation. In 1996, the last year for which a party affiliation is attached to her votes, Deen voted in the Republican presidential primary.\n\nIn an interview with The New York Times last year, Deen was prodded to reveal her choice for president. \"Obama or Romney,?\" the interviewer asked. \"Quick, go.\" Perhaps on death glares from her publicist, Deen didn\u2019t answer, but instead gave a list of things she\u2019d implement if she were president. Think soda cups with no size limits.\n\nFinally, we consulted with The Associated Press\u2019 Savannah-area reporter, the metro editor of Savannah\u2019s daily newspaper and a Georgia political science professor and longtime politics watcher. All three cried foul on Elder\u2019s claim and said they were unaware of Deen ever publicly supporting Obama or getting involved in politics.\n\nSo Elder\u2019s claim that Deen campaigned for and supported Obama falls like a biscuit with no baking powder.\n\nThe source for these claims traces back to an Us Weekly magazine item, and unless Us Weekly is privy to some information that it is not willing to share, there seems to be nothing to substantiate its claim. And because its information is wrong, so is everyone else -- including Elder -- who has used the magazine data as a source for their claims of Deen backing Obama.\n\nWe rated Elder\u2019s claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09113"}
