Rick Scott about practically any topic and he is bound to steer the conversation back to jobs.\nThe former CEO of a health care company loves to cite statistics that relate to job growth, such as this one in a March 31 online ad:\n\"Florida\u2019s economy is on a better path. Since December 2010 Florida has created 540,000 new jobs. Let\u2019s keep working.\"\nScott, who has governed during the national recovery, is expected to face former Gov. Charlie Crist, who governed during the recession, in November. The jobs picture under both governors is a key topic of debate in the race.\nDid Scott correctly cite the number of new jobs in Florida?\nPrivate vs. public-sector jobs\nScott started the clock ticking in December 2010, one month before the Republican took office. His campaign used data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics to arrive at the figure.\nBLS data shows that the number of total nonfarm jobs grew by 517,500 between December 2010 and preliminary data for February 2014, the most recent month available. That\u2019s a little short of the number Scott used.\nScott gets to his number by ignoring reductions in government jobs. During the same time frame, Florida lost 23,200 government jobs. So if it hadn\u2019t been for the lost government jobs, the number would be 540,000.\nAt PolitiFact Florida we are very familiar with Scott\u2019s statements about jobs and have been tracking his 2010 campaign promise to create over 700,000 jobs in seven years. That promise is currently rated In the Works.\nWhen Scott debuted his jobs promise in July 2010, state economists had released estimates showing that Florida would add 1.05 million jobs between July 1, 2010, and June 30, 2018 -- no matter who served as governor.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Godlewski\n\n\nstated on January 9, 2021 in Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all women that lost jobs (in the December jobs report), it was mostly Black and Latina women. In fact, white women gained employment.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Nusaiba Mizan \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn response, Scott clarified his promise and said that his 700,000 jobs would come in addition to the ones state economists forecasted. Put simpler: his 7-7-7 plan became 7-7-1.7 million.\nScott\u2019s press office has consistently disagreed with our analysis, saying Scott\u2019s campaign materials never qualified that 700,000 jobs would be on top of normal growth projections.\nTo achieve the goal of 700,000 jobs on top of normal growth requires the state to produce more than 20,000 jobs on average per month, every month, for seven years. He has fallen short of that average the majority of the months, though the jobs picture improved in 2013.\nIn this particular online ad, Scott doesn\u2019t use words to take credit for the job growth, but he is touting job growth during his watch.\nWe have interviewed economists in the past who caution that a governor can\u2019t take much credit for job growth during a national recovery -- or too much blame for job losses during a national recession.\nKwame Donaldson, an economist at Moody\u2019s who analyzes Florida, said that the creation of 540,000 private-sector jobs in the 38 months since December 2010 is not a particularly exceptional rate of job creation.\n\"The most private-sector jobs created during any 38-month interval is 753,100 (during the 38-month interval that ended in August 2006),\" Donaldson said in an email to PolitiFact Florida. \"The current record is even less remarkable considering Florida\u2019s larger current population.\"\nOur ruling\nScott said in an online ad, \"Since December 2010 Florida has created 540,000 new jobs.\"\nLooking only at the numbers -- and not whether Scott\u2019s policies should get credit for the growth -- Florida added 517,500 total nonfarm jobs and lost 23,000 government-sector jobs between December 2010 and February 2014.\nIt would have been more accurate for Scott to cite private-sector job growth.\nWe rate this claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08052"}
