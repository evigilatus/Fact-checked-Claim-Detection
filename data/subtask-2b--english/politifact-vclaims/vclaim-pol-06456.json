That was the claim made a couple of times during the HBO/Showtime pay-per-view broadcast.\nTicket sales topped $74 million (more than the Super Bowl), organizers said, and another 3 million people were expected to fork over $100 to watch the fight at home. Add in other sources of revenue and Saturday\u2019s event was projected to generate an estimated $400 million.\nThat\u2019s \"larger than the annual GDP of 29 different countries,\" HBO boxing sportscaster Jim Lampley said during the live broadcast.\nWe\u2019re not sure where Lampley and event organizers got their information from -- we weren\u2019t able to get in touch with him or someone from HBO -- but that figure is way off, according to the World Bank, which tracks global financial data for about 200 countries and territories.\nThere are only six countries with an annual Gross Domestic Product of less than $400 million, according to the bank\u2019s 2013 ranking. (GDP is the monetary value of all goods and services that an economy produces in a year and a standard measurement of an economy\u2019s size).\nAll six are tiny island nations. Here are their 2013 GDPs:\n\n\nMicronesia: $316 million\n\n\nSao Tome and Principe: $311 million\n\n\nPalau: $247 million\n\n\nMarshall Islands: $191 million\n\n\nKiribati: $169 million\n\n\nTuvalu: $38 million\n\n\nThe country with the seventh-lowest GDP is Tonga, with a GDP of $466 million, just surpassing the estimated revenue of the Mayweather-Pacquiao fight. For comparison, the United States had the world\u2019s largest GDP in 2013 -- $16.8 trillion.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe think one explanation for the large discrepancy with Lampley\u2019s claim is the fact that the World Bank doesn\u2019t have GDP data for 22 economies.\nBut of the missing 22, most are territories of other nations -- for example the United States territory of Guam or the British territory of the Cayman Islands. Only six without a 2013 World Bank GDP are fully independent nations: Andorra, North Korea, Liechtenstein, Myanmar, Somalia and Syria.\nWe looked up the most recent GDP estimates we could find for each country to see if any were less than $400 million, but we found that all six exceeded that amount:\n\n\nAndorra: $3.7 billion (2008 -- World Bank)\n\n\nNorth Korea: $28 billion (2009 -- CIA World Factbook)\n\n\nLiechtenstein: $4.8 billion (2009 -- World Bank)\n\n\nMyanmar: $64.3 billion (2014 -- CIA World Factbook)\n\n\nSomalia: $2.4 billion (2010 -- CIA World Factbook)\n\n\nSyria: $40.4 billion (2007 -- World Bank)\n\n\nSo in total, only six countries have GDPs smaller than the revenue brought in by the Mayweather-Pacquiao fight.\nOur ruling\nLampley said the revenue brought in by the Mayweather-Pacquiao fight was \"larger than the annual GDP of 29 different countries.\"\nThe match was estimated to generate about $400 million, which is a lot of money, to be sure. But only six out of the world\u2019s nearly 200 countries have GDPs smaller than that, according to World Bank data.\nWe\u2019re KO\u2019ing this claim. Pants on Fire!\nCorrection: All 50 U.S. states have a gross state product in excess of $400 million.
