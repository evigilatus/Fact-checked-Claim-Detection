I'll defend myself, and I'll be happy to answer to any democracy that tries to distort what I said. \"And I made a simple mistake.\" _: Fox News interview on the record with Greta Van Susterin, 17 May 2011*** Former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Newt Jingerick, R-Ga. But it wasn't exactly the bribe he was looking for. In addition to a polite exchange with a voter from Iowa who was taken on a video, a shiny attack by homophobic protestors, a six-digit debt to a fancy retailer Tiffany, and a series of articles questioning the accuracy of his facts, Jingerick also took heat from conservatives for an alleged heart about whether he supported the budget plan of the Republican Party Paul Ryan, R-Wiss, which was approved by the House of Representatives under the control of the Democratic Party. Ryan &apos; s budget includes spending cuts that were strong and led to the activation of conservatives, and changes in medical care that provoked the anger of liberals. Support for Ryan's plan has become a good test for the Republicans, especially those running for the presidency. The position of Jingrik on the plan must therefore become a problem. The views of Jingrik on Ryan &apos; s proposal have already varied over time - and have also been somewhat more precise than the popular reaction might suggest. In an article in Facebook on March 17, 2010, Jingrik wrote in favour of Ryan's former plan, known as the \"road map.\" The \"road map\" is very similar to the budget decision adopted by the House of Representatives earlier this year, including in its approach to medical care. The Jingrik article calls Ryan's proposal \"a comprehensive and bold solution to America's serious problem of rapidly rising debt.\" The reforms of the road map are registered by community organizations as the achievement of full social security and medical care, the elimination of all long-term federal deficits and the long-term balance in the federal budget. I know that Congressman Ryan remains committed to improving the quality of life for all Americans, both now and in the future, and this road map is a comprehensive way to do so.\" More than a year later, Jingrik told the journalist in Time Jae Newton Small that he would have voted for Ryan's last plan if he was serving at home. I put pressure on whether it would actually save the healthcare system, and Jingerick answered, \"No, I think it's the first step. You need a whole new set of solutions.\" In other words, Jingrik pointed out that the plan deserved to be voted on but added that it was not a silver bullet. A few days later, in comments at the Brookings Institution on April 23, 2011, Jingrik once again praised Ryan's great thinking, but added that \"There are details (of the plan) I do not agree. According to an account in the Daily Caller, one of his reservations was \"cutting investment in science and research.\" The cuts in scientific funding envisaged under Ryan's plan are \"like saying that I want to save money on your car, and we will not change oil. For about a year I can go unpunished. And then the engine will freeze, and we have to replace your engine. But if I have a CBO office that records oil but doesn't record engines, I can replace the engine for free annually, because it won't be counted as a budget cost.\" This seems to reinforce the view that Jingrik supported the proposal, but not without qualifications. Then came the press meeting on May 15, 2011. The host asked David Gregory Jingrich, \"Do you think Republicans should support the public opposition and really advance to change medical care completely, and turn it into a coupon program where you give older people... some premium support and -- so they can go out and buy private insurance?\" Jingerick replied: \"I don't think social engineering of the right is more desirable than social engineering of the left. I don't think imposing a radical change from the right or the left is a very good way for a free society to work.\" After explaining his desire to dispose of waste and abuse, Jingrik insisted that \"there are things you can do to improve medical care.\" \"But not what Paul Ryan proposes, which completely changes medical care?\" Gregory suggested it. Jingerick said, \"I think this is a very big leap. I think what you want is a system where people voluntarily migrate to better results, better solutions, better choices, not a system where you suddenly impose on -- I don't want to -- I'm against Obamakar, who imposes a radical change, and I'm against conservatives who impose a radical change. While Gingrich didn't tell Gregory explicitly, \"I wouldn't vote for Ryan's proposal,\" his position seems very clear to us -- he didn't like Ryan Medecker's reform. So we think it's fair to say that after the interview, Jingrik made at least half a point on whether to implement Ryan's proposal. But this wasn't the end of it. In an interview with the opening page of the Wall Street Journal the day after the press meet, Jingrich retreated to some extent. He \"maybe he used very powerful language\" in the presentation, although he added, \"I've thought about this for a long time and I'm very, very worried. I think passing the bill in its current form would be a political disaster the moment the conservatives have had a chance to \"break the left for the first time since 1932.\" Jingerick therefore referred to the Wall Street Journal as an over-estimate, but he still believes that passing the bill in its current form would be a \"political disaster.\" However, there was more in the future. In a wave of criticism, mostly from disgruntled conservatives, of his failure to fully support Ryan &apos; s proposal, Jingrich on Fox News went on the record with Greta Van Soostrin on May 17, 2011, to expand and clarify his remarks. On January 13, 2021, the distinguished fact-finding bloggers announced in a story in which General David H. Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request to use the Marines to launch security, saying, \"We are not working for you.\" And I called Paul Ryan today, and he's a very close personal friend, and I said that. The truth is, I supported what Ryan tried to do in the budget. The truth is, my newsletter highly praised the budget when I took it out. And the sound of the budget is a voice that I'm happy to say I was going to vote for. I'll defend myself, and I'll be happy to answer to any democracy that tries to distort what I said. And I made a simple mistake. \"So, let me say in the record: any statement quoting what I said on Sunday is a lie and because I said it publicly, those words were inaccurate and unfortunate. And I'm willing to stand up -- when I make a mistake, and I go sometimes, I want to stand up and share with the American people, that was wrong, because that way, we can have an honest conversation.\" In other words, Jingrik used the appearance with Van Susteren to retract any suggestion that he would have voted against Ryan's plan. As we pointed out, the closed reading of the press interview shows that Jingrik never specifically said he was going to vote against Ryan's plan. But he certainly made it clear that he believed that one of the key provisions of the plan -- changes in medical care -- was a \"very big leap\" for him to support. And by saying on Van Soostrin that he made a mistake in his comments on the press meeting -- a mistake big enough to make. We believe that Gingerick &apos; s overall position was more precise than some coverage indicated. But his philosophical journeys -- from full Facebook endorsement in 2010 to qualified endorsements at Time and at the Brookings Conference, to assessing the decline in the press meeting, to the hasty re-ratification of the Van Susterin program -- suggest that Jingrich's support for Ryan's proposal has regressed and flowed over time. It seems that Jingrik has gone a whole circle of his views on the proposal, and it is classified in our book as a complete file.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13074"}
