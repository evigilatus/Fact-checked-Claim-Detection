We found that while MRCTV\u2019s data for arrivals under 18 is largely accurate, its interpretation of who should count as a minor differs from the government definition.\nThe public relations firm representing MRCTV, which says its goal is to \"break down the boundaries between traditional conservative media and mainstream culture,\" did not respond to requests for information.\nViolence and poverty\nGang violence and poverty in Central American nations has propelled thousands of children to leave their homes unaccompanied and cross illegally into the United States.\nThe number of Central American children coming alone started to increase in fiscal year 2012, largely due to an influx from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. It rose significantly in fiscal year 2014, according to data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\nThe number of unaccompanied children (0 to 17 years old) from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras apprehended at the southwest border reached a high in fiscal year 2014 at 51,705, up from 10,146 in fiscal year 2012, per border patrol data.\nApprehensions of unaccompanied children from those three Central American countries dropped in fiscal year 2015 but picked up again in fiscal year 2016.\nThe White House in June 2014 announced a series of new programs and partnerships with Central American countries to address economic and criminal problems that motivated youth to migrate to the United States.\nCentral American Minors program\nPresident Barack Obama\u2019s administration in November 2014 also announced a refugee/parole program \"to provide a safe, legal, and orderly alternative to the dangerous journey that some children are currently undertaking to the United States.\"\nThe Central American Minors program allows certain parents with lawful presence in the United States to petition for their children in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras to come in as refugees. Children ineligible for admission as refugees but at risk of harm may be admitted under parole.\nA \"qualifying child\" must be unmarried, under 21 and living in Guatemala, El Salvador or Honduras, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.\nThe immigration agency says that in certain cases, a parent who lives with a qualifying child may also apply for the program if he or she is the legal spouse of the person in the United States requesting the child\u2019s resettlement.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe program was expanded in 2016 to allow additional family members to apply. A State Department spokesperson said given the time it takes to vet applicants, no one who would be eligible under the expansion has been admitted yet.\nMore than 10,500 people have applied for the Central American Minors program and 1,644 have been admitted as of Dec. 1, according to the State Department.\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of the 1,644 arrivals:\n\"Minors\" admissions comprise 83 percent:\n- 484 (29 percent) under 18 years old\n- 1,106 (67 percent) under 21 years old\n- 1,370 (83 percent) under 22 years old\n\"The reason that some arrivals are 21 (not under 21, as the program specifies) is that a qualifying child must be \u2018under 21\u2019 at the time the application is received, but can arrive as a 21-year-old, since the adjudication process takes approximately one year on average,\" a State Department spokesperson said.\nThe remaining 17 percent of arrivals are the legal/biological parents of the qualifying child, according to the State Department.\n\nMRCTV\u2019s post that more than two-thirds of arrivals under the programs aren\u2019t minors is technically accurate when accounting for minors as applicants under 18.\nGenerally in the United States, 18 is considered the \"age of majority\" and the age when individuals are no longer considered minors. (Eighteen is the minimum age to vote, but Americans must be 21 to legally buy alcohol.)\nBut immigration law has a different rule: \"A \u2018child\u2019 is defined as an individual who is unmarried and under the age of 21,\" according to USCIS.\nThe reason? People who may have been targeted for persecution when they were under 18 could still be at risk when they cross that threshold, said Peter Margulies, who teaches immigration law and national security law at Roger Williams University School of Law.\n\"Gangs still want more members,\" Margulies said. \"If gangs don't care if their target is 17 or 20, the United States should extend protection in both cases. Otherwise, the individual remains in danger of persecution.\"\n\"Gangs do not stop their abuse on a victim\u2019s 18th birthday,\" added Michael Kagan, a law professor and director of the immigration clinic at University of Nevada, Las Vegas.\nOur ruling\nAn article by MRCTV said, \"More than two-thirds of the aliens the Obama administration has brought to the United States under the president's Central American Minors program weren\u2019t actually minors at all.\"\nPer State Department data, 83 percent (1,370) of 1,644 individuals who have come to the United States through the program have been under 22 years old and qualifying minors, including 484 people (29 percent) under 18 years old.\nThough 18 is generally considered the age of adulthood, for immigration purposes, an unmarried person under 21 is considered a \"child,\" meeting the qualifying age for the minors program. Some individuals who were 21 were admitted because they were under the age at the time of their application.\nMRCTV\u2019s statement is accurate but needs additional clarification.\u00a0We rate it Mostly True.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7a405132-d56b-48c6-9c1e-e78f01b98eb3", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03886"}
