Currently, Gableman is among the conservative justices who have 5-2 control on the seven-member court.\nIn his first radio ad of the campaign, Screnock attacked both Dallet and Burns while also alluding to Republican Gov. Scott Walker, who appointed Screnock to the bench. In the spot, released Jan. 29, 2018, Screnock introduces himself and then makes a two-part claim about Dallet and Burns:\nThey have openly criticized laws signed by Governor Walker that they disagree with and are campaigning as activists who will implement their policies from the bench.\nIs that what Burns -- who has been especially outspoken about his political views -- and Dallet have been doing?\nIt's worth noting that\u00a0Screnock\u00a0has\u00a0hired GOP consultants and has received a $31,152 in-kind donation from the state Republican Party. He also\u00a0released a radio ad that points out he was appointed to the bench by Walker.\nBut to evaluate his claim, here\u2019s a look at statements made by Burns and Dallet since they announced their candidacies and up until Screnock made his claim about them.\n\u2018Openly criticized\u2019 Walker laws\nWe found that Burns has been repeatedly critical of laws signed by Walker:\n\n\n\n\nBurns statements on laws signed by Walker\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nAct 10\nInterview, Jan. 8, 2018\n\n\nWalker\u2019s union-curbing Act 10 \"is blatantly unconstitutional.\"\n\n\n\n\nAct 10\nSpeech, June 2, 2017\n\n\nJustice Michael Gableman (who had not yet announced he would not seek another term) restricted \"workers\u2019 right to bargain.\"\n\n\n\n\n\u2018Walker\u2019s agenda\u2019\nLeague of Women Voters Q&A\n\n\n\"The Wisconsin Supreme Court has been a rubber stamp for Scott Walker\u2019s harmful agenda.\"\n\n\n\n\nVoter ID\nCandidate forum, Jan. 29, 2018\n\n\n\"I believe that gerrymandering and photo ID are great dangers to democracy.\"\n\n\n\n\nFoxconn\nInterview, Jan. 8, 2018\n\n\nOn state\u2019s $3 billion incentives for Foxconn: \"I am opposed to the notion of large corporations playing on a different playing field from our small farms and our small businesses.\"\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nBurns\u2019 campaign told us this part of Screnock\u2019s statement, as it applies to Burns, is accurate.\nIn contrast, we found only one Dallet statement about a Walker law. But her criticism was of the Supreme Court, not Act 10.\n\n\n\n\nDallet statement on laws signed by Walker\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nAct 10\nInterview, Jan. 2, 2018\n\n\nOn a challenge to Walker\u2019s Act 10 union-curbing law: \"I think that the (Supreme) Court got it wrong \u2026.I think that they didn\u2019t analyze the actual issue. The issue in the Act 10 case was whether the right to association was being violated by all of the penalties essentially being put on unions. And they analyzed it under a right to collective bargaining, which everyone agrees, there is no right to collectively bargain. There is a right, instead, to have freedom of association.\"\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nDallet told us in a statement: \"I\u2019ve been careful to limit my criticisms to decisions the court has already made, in cases that have been completed,\" such as the Act 10 case.\nNow to the second part of Screnock\u2019s claim.\n\u2018Campaigning to implement policies from the bench\u2019\nBoth Burns and Dallet have made statements indicating positions they hold on issues, though Burns has been considerably more direct.\n\n\n\n\nBurns statements\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018Liberal values\u2019\nCandidates forum, Jan. 22, 2018\n\n\n\"On the Wisconsin Supreme Court, I will be an unshakable champion of liberal, democratic and progressive values.\"\n\n\n\n\nTaxes\nInterview, Jan. 8, 2018\n\n\nIn response to a question, says taxes on the wealthy should be raised to provide attorneys for poor in civil cases such as evictions.\n\n\n\n\n\u2018We\u2019 Democrats\nInterview, Jan. 17, 2018\n\n\n\"We\" won, referring to victory the previous day by Democrat Patty Schachtner in state Senate special election.\n\n\n\n\n\u2018I\u2019m a Democrat\u2019\nInterview, Jan. 9, 2018\n\n\n\"I\u2019m a Democrat with a big D.\"\n\n\n\n\nMiddle class\nInterview, Jan. 17, 2018\n\n\n\"When the Legislature or a governor passes a law that's a basic attack on our middle-class democracy, that's when courts have to step in and say, No way, Bub.\"\n\n\n\n\n\u2018Progressive majority\u2019\nInterview, Jan. 8, 2018\n\n\n\"We can have a progressive majority on the court by the spring of 2020.\"\n\n\n\n\n\u2018Expanding rights\u2019\nCandidates forum, Jan. 22, 2018\n\n\n\"If expanding rights is legislating from the bench, count me in.\"\n\n\n\n\n\u2018Political values\u2019\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCandidates forum, Jan. 22, 2018\n\n\n\"From day one of this campaign, I have been candid with voters about what my political views are and my belief that political values -- when you have a constitution that talks about equal protection and due process -- ultimately impacts how you decide cases.\"\n\n\n\n\n\u2018Political decisions\u2019\nCandidates forum, Jan. 22, 2018\n\n\n\"I am the first candidate on the left in this state for this position who has said enough is enough with this nonsense that judges don\u2019t make political decisions.\"\n\n\n\n\nReproductive rights\nCandidate forum, Jan. 29, 2018\n\n\n\"I believe the government has no role in our bedroom or our reproductive decisions, period.\"\n\n\n\n\n\u2018Progressive politics\u2019\nSpeech, June 2, 2017\n\n\n\"I am running a nonpartisan race, but I will not run from progressive organizations and I will not run from progressive politics.

For example, she told the 2017 Wisconsin Democratic Party convention:\nSome will tell you that the solution to partisan judges on the right is to elect more partisan judges, just from the other side. I have a different view of the world, in that I think judges really do need to be independent \u2026.I don\u2019t think the answer is just to come here and tell you that judges need to vote like partisan Democrats to counteract partisan Republican judges. If we fall into the trap of politicizing the third branch, we turn our backs on our true progressive history.\n\u00a0\nAt the same time, Dallet has stated which issues are important to her.\n\n\n\n\nDallet statements\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018Rights under attack\u2019\nCandidates forum, Jan. 22, 2018\n\n\n\"We\u2019re living in a time when our rights are under attack every day.

Same with gerrymandering. Voting is one of our basic civil rights, our way that we can change our society. And when you take that right away -- we should all care about that.\"\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nSo, Dallet suggests she would be inclined to act against Wisconsin\u2019s voter ID law, but otherwise has more generally stated which issues are important to her rather than indicating she would take certain actions.\nIn her statement to us, Dallet said voters \"want independent, nonpartisan judges who share their values, and ... I won\u2019t be afraid to stand up to Donald Trump and Scott Walker, or whomever is in power, when I\u2019m on the Supreme Court bench.\"\nOur rating\nScrenock says Burns and Dallet \"have openly criticized laws signed by Governor Walker that they disagree with and are campaigning as activists who will implement their policies from the bench.\"\nBurns has been explicit on both counts. Dallet hasn\u2019t criticized laws signed by Walker or campaigned to implement certain policies, although she has identified certain issues that are important to her.\nFor a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True.
