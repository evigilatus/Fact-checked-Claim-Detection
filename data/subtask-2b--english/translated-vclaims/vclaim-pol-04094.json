You don't, \"Trap said in Las Vegas October 19. \"As you run the State Department, $6 billion is missing. How could you miss $6 billion? You run the State Department, $6 billion either you stole - they don't know. He's gone, $6 billion. If I become president, this country will be a mess. Believe me.\" Clinton answered, \"Well, first of all, what he just said about the State Department is not only incorrect, it has been dismantled many times.\" In fact, the claim that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs lost $6 billion, or that it was stolen, was exposed. Including by us. The inaccurate allegation of Trump stems from a misreading of a March 2014 alert issued by the Office of the Inspector General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The warning found that the paper transactions of the various contracts had been mismanaged. These contracts together amounted to about $6 billion. The money wasn't lost, the paperwork was missing. The Inspector General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent an alert summarizing previous audits, which found that the paperwork for more than $6 billion of contracts from 2008 to 2014 was \"deficit or could not be located at all.\" The audit period covered a period of time before Clinton became Secretary of State. A spokesman for the Office of the Inspector General of Bolivi Fact said earlier that the alarm spoke for itself, but it seemed that many misinterpreted what he had already said. This confusion prompted Inspector General Steve Lennick to register an explanation in the Washington Post. \"Some have therefore concluded that $6 billion is missing. However, the warning did not draw that conclusion.\" Instead, it has been shown that insufficient retention of contract files - documents necessary to ensure full accounting of United States tax dollars - creates significant financial risks and proves that there is no internal control over the Department's contract procedures.\" In other words, the Department of State was awful in paperwork. The figure of $6 billion indicates the total amount affected by poor file management. It's like failing to get a receipt for your $20 food. The documents on where that $20 went, but not the $20 itself. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 11 January 2021, for example, the Inspector General notes that an audit of the Office of African Affairs found that the Office had not been able to provide complete management files for eight separate contracts, with a combined value of $34.8 million. Therefore, the State Department under Clinton may be financially unorganized, and according to the warning, it opens itself to fraud. But she didn't \"lose\" $6 billion. There was no suggestion that he was \"accepted.\" Our referee Trump said that when Clinton ran the State Department, there were $6 billion missing. How could you miss $6 billion? You run the State Department, $6 billion either you stole -- they don't know.\" The $6 billion comes from the report of the Inspector General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which found that the papers on the various contracts had been mismanaged. The $6 billion was not missing or stolen - it was disposed of in a number of contracts - but the paperwork was missing. We appreciate Trump's claim for pants on fire. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/551338c-9761-413a-abbbd-a5d048e1f79c Correct: To summarize the alarm prior reviews of Ministry of Foreign Affairs contracts.
