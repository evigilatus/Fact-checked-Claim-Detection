He charged her again after leaking an extract from one of her letters into a hacked e-mail. \"We don't have a country if we don't have borders. During the debate at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas on 19 October, Trump said. \"You want to have open borders.\" Clinton responded that it supported border security for years and included it in its presidential plan for migration. This led discussant Chris Wallace to ask Clinton to explain her remarks on the \"open borders\" of the Brazilian Banko Itau in 2013. Here's this extract, as WikiLeaks published: \"My dream is a common market for the western hemisphere, with open trade and open borders, sometime in the future with as much green and sustainable energy as we can get, In the discussion, Clinton replied that the whole of the speech related to energy. \"I was talking about energy. As you know, we exchange more energy with our neighbors than with the rest of the world combined, \"she said. \"And I want us to have a grid, a power system that crosses the border. I think that would be a great benefit to us.\" Trump shook his head, resisting again: \"You want open borders. People will pour into our country.\" We'll check whether Clinton is an open border. At a gathering in Pennsylvania earlier this month, Trump made a similar allegation, that Clinton had made \"an intense invitation to open borders, which means anyone in the world who could enter the United States without any borders whatsoever.\" We've often misjudged his claim. The Trump campaign referred us to Clinton &apos; s pledge to introduce immigration legislation within the first 100 days of her tenure and to help dreams, children who were illegally brought into the United States as children. However, this does not amount to the need for open borders. Clinton supported legislation in 2013 (which has never been adopted) that includes a way to citizenship on terms and billions to enforce border enforcement procedures for new surveillance equipment and fencing along the Mexican border, as well as the addition of 20,000 border personnel. As a candidate, she would focus on the deportation of violent or threatening criminals. Some experts disagree on the meaning of \"open borders.\" According to Stephen Kamaruta, a spokesman for the Centre for Migration Studies who advocates low levels of migration, her focus on the deportation of violent criminals is only a small proportion of the undocumented population. \"This can reasonably be seen as open borders since almost all those who join the illegal population will not have to leave, making current restrictions and borders silent,\" he said. On February 1, 2021, Tom Cotton mentioned in an interview with Fox and friends \"Many of these arriving immigrants, we have no way of checking their background for either health or security.\" \u2022 On February 3, 2021, Daniel Costa, Director of Immigration and Political Research Law at the Institute of Left-wing Economic Policy, said that Clinton had not produced sufficient details of her plans, such as her position on the future flow of migrant workers. \"Situations on these issues would shed a lot of light on whether or not they support something approaching open borders (although the term open limits can mean a lot of things), he said. However, in general, we heard from experts that although Clinton wants to make it easier for many undocumented migrants to obtain legal status, this is not the same as completely eliminating enforcement and allowing borders to be opened. When WikiLeaks published the extracts of Clinton's speech on open borders earlier this month, we asked immigration experts whether her statement was an invitation to open borders for migrants. Experts said that Clinton &apos; s remarks were not a clear call for opening borders. They also said that her statement seemed inspiring and did not contain a timetable or an explanation of how this could be achieved politically. (We asked the Clinton campaign for a full speech, but we did not get a response to that request, so we can only evaluate the excerpts.) My guess is that the Clinton speech in Brazil reflects this broader call for greater cooperation in the hemisphere on a variety of issues, including trade, Stephen Kelly, Professor of Public Policy at Duke University. \"In view of this context, and without seeing the rest of her speech, I also believe that the \"open borders\" I mentioned relate to the movement of goods and capital, but not to people.\" Dave Gartenstein-Ross, Senior Fellow of the Foundation for the Defence of Democracies, a policy institute focusing on foreign policy and national security, said that Clinton seemed to refer to something related to travel such as the Schengen Agreement, which abolished many of the internal borders of the European Union. For example, if the United States and Canada had such an agreement, that would not mean opening free immigration borders, but rather freedom of travel. \"I don't think she calls for open migration, but the context of her observations shows that when she says \"open borders,\" she means not only open trade,\" he said: Jacob Vigdor, Professor of Policy and Governance at Washington University, said that Clinton seemed to speak of both trade and migration. \"I will read the observation that it calls for the opening of borders with respect to both trade and migration. The phrase \"open trade and open borders\" would be redundant. However, he did not see a timetable in her remarks after \"sometime in the future,\" or a discussion on how that could be achieved. \"I do not necessarily see a contradiction between the statement of ideals and a more realistic policy agenda for reality,\" he said: \"One can dream of a crime-free world where neither the police nor the prisons are needed while still supporting those things in fact.\" The Governor Trump said that Clinton wanted to have open borders. Although she wants to make it easier for some undocumented migrants to stay here, she repeatedly said she supports border security, so Trump exaggerates when he says she wants open borders. In a brief address from 2013, she called for \"a common market for the hemisphere, with open trade and open borders, sometime in the future with green and sustainable energy.\" Clinton said she was talking about clean energy, but we can't fully assess her remarks to the bank because we don't have the full word. We're evaluating this statement mostly wrong. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c16e4a7b-33dc-4d39-a1ff-c739d65bf3a9", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04098"}
