It's that people will choose not to buy something they don't like or want.\" (We rated that Mostly False, because many of those people will not voluntarily lose coverage.)\nThen the Politicot.com story said Ryan launched into a tirade to Fox\u2019s Brian Kilmeade about how people should be able to provide for themselves and their families through hard work. That\u2019s where the story turned to fiction.\n\"Being rich or poor is a matter of choice; that\u2019s all there is to it,\" Ryan is quoted. \"So, let me ask you this, Brian: if 22 million people consciously make the choice to not work hard day in and day out, why on earth should the rest of us be concerned with whether or not they\u2019re going to be healthy? If they choose to be poor, then it\u2019s their own problem if they can\u2019t afford to be healthy.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyan didn\u2019t say that last part, because this story was posted on a parody site that makes up all manner of bogus news stories. We reached out to Ryan\u2019s office but a spokeswoman did not give any comment on the fake quotes.\nPoliticot.com is part of a network of sites related to Newslo.com, which refers to itself in a disclaimer as \"the first hybrid News/Satire platform on the web.\" The Politicot.com site is registered to an administrator named Eli Sompo, who runs sites based in Israel and Greece.\nSompo has told us he did not write the stories on the websites for which he is responsible, but has several clients. He informed us months ago that he would block any future questions from PolitiFact about the sites.\nWhat makes Newslo.com-related stories especially confusing is that they use a small piece of real news or quotes by real people and build fake stories around them. In most cases it is the first paragraph of the story, as happened here.\nThe websites feature a pair of buttons that allow readers to highlight the true parts of their stories, so readers can conceivably know the difference.\nBut it isn\u2019t always obvious that\u2019s the aim, leading the audience to believe the entire story is true \u2014 especially when other fake news sites steal the articles and post them without any warning at all.\nRyan did discuss how the Senate\u2019s proposed legislation would affect poor people, but he never said 22 million people choose to be poor.\nWe rate this claim Pants On Fire!\n Share the Facts 2017-07-11 16:05:36 UTC   PolitiFact    1 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Pants on Fire  Says Paul Ryan said that 22 million Americans \"choose to be poor, so it\u2019s their own problem if they can\u2019t afford to be healthy.\"    Newslo.com website   in an Internet post Wednesday, June 28, 2017 2017-06-28    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03124"}
