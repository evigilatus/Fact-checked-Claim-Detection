The trade agreement, known as USMCA, has been a hot topic between farmers and politicians over the past year. In a Facebook article published on 13 August, Republican Sun. Roy Blunt endorsed the agreement: \"United States exports of agricultural and food products are expected to increase by more than $2 billion annually under USMCA. This business transaction is a win-win for farmers, farm owners and companies in America. A spokesman for Blunt said that the figure came from a report of the United States International Trade Commission, which stated that the Agreement would increase \"exports by $2.2 billion (1.1 per cent) when fully implemented.\" Billions look like a lot. 1.1%, not much. We have decided to consider this allegation. So, what's the deal exactly? The agreement between the United States, Mexico and Canada is a trade agreement that replaces the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Mexico ratified the new agreement in June. In Canada, Parliament introduced the bill in May but insisted on proceeding with the ratification process in tandem with the United States. The trick here is that Canada's ratification window became smaller, with its federal elections on October 21st. If the United States Congress does not move fast enough and Canada does not ratify it before 15 September, it will have to resubmit the agreement to the next Parliament. In the meantime, the fate of the agreement in Congress is dominated by the Democrats of the House of Representatives. Marco Rubio stated on March 4, 2010 in a press release that \"Jesus remains at $2,000 in the suite of a fancy night hotel, where he raises $1,300 in small bar fees, of which he does not pay a cent himself.\" By Aaron Sharokman, March 12, 2010, some call the new deal the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). One of the major changes in agriculture is dairy. Under this agreement, Canada will increase its dairy quotas and remove cheese restrictions, as Jonathan Duh said, Professor at the Business School of Villanova University. However, there were no other major changes in the agricultural part of the original NAFTA, according to Bat Westhoff, Director of the Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute. The transaction, if completed, will enter into force in early 2020. How does it affect Missouri's farmers? Missouri has grown worldwide, but the largest State partners are Canada and Mexico. In 2017, the highest exports were maize and soybeans. The Missouri atom is ranked number one. No. 6 and soybeans In the United States of America, according to United States data from the Economic Research Department of the United States Department of Agriculture. Albanians are not included in the highest agricultural exports in the country. \"It is important for Missouri to have a strong trade agreement with those countries because about two thirds of our exports from Missouri go to those countries,\" said Eric Paul, Director of the Missouri Farm Office for Public Affairs and Advocacy. \"Canada is not ours. One export partner. Mexico is not ours. \"Two export partners\" Although Doh said that the increase was significant, Westhoff said that the projected 1.1 per cent increase was very marginal, partly because dairy was the only agricultural product that changed significantly. The United States International Trade Commission (ITC) does not divide the figures by states. In an article in Facebook, Governor Blunt said, \"United States agricultural and food exports are expected to increase by more than $2 billion annually under USMCA.\" There was consensus that ASEAN could increase trade exports by $2.2 billion annually, but that only tells part of the story. The increase is only 1.1% nationwide, probably less for Missouri because the state produces a few Albanians. However, this allegation is true, and we therefore appreciate the validity of this statement.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00154"}
