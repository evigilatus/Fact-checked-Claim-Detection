That decision leaves Newark owing about $600,000 to the Devils.\n\nA few days after denouncing Vanderbeek as a \"high-class, high-falutin\u2019 huckster and hustler,\" Booker continued his battle against the hockey team owner during an April 9 interview on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe program.\n\n\"Not only did he make those promises, but he was required to do so by the contract,\" Booker said. \"He froze all those monies during the toughest years in \u201808-\u201909, when our economy was falling out. He refused to give the charitable dollars that he was required to give by the contract.\"\n\nFor the most part, the mayor\u2019s claim is on solid ground, PolitiFact New Jersey found. As the legal dispute rolled on, the Devils did not make $1.5 million in combined payments over three years of the lease agreement for youth and community sports programs and job training programs, according to the arbitrators\u2019 decision.\n\nBut the hockey team did pay $346,576 toward those programs for the first year of the lease agreement, according to the decision.\n\nIn a statement, Booker spokeswoman Anne Torres argued that \"the $346,576 paid only represents a fraction of what is owed.\"\n\n\"We\u2019re disappointed that Politifact is choosing (to)...ignore the facts surrounding Jeff Vanderbeek\u2019s decision to neglect his public commitments to the city,\" Torres wrote. \"Year after year, the Devils have denied resources to charities and job training programs.\"\n\nLet\u2019s explain how those programs factor into the lease agreement for the arena.\n\nUnder a February 2005 lease agreement with the Newark Housing Authority, which owns the arena, the Devils agreed to pay rent consisting of four components. At the outset, two of those components were $250,000 annual payments for youth and community sports programs, as well as $250,000 annual payments for job training programs.\n\nThe Devils paid $173,288 for each of the two sets of programs for the first year of the contract, which ran from October 2007 to June 2008, according to the arbitrators\u2019 decision. The payments were smaller because the first payments applied to less than a full year.\n\nBut as a result of the legal dispute, the Devils paid no rent in years two through four of the lease agreement, according to the arbitrators\u2019 decision. The team was asserting its right to withhold rent under a clause in the lease agreement, the decision states.\n\nArena spokesman Robert Sommer argued that both the city and the team were withholding payments to each other.\n\n\"They withheld money as well,\" Sommer told us. \"No payments were being made in either direction.\"\n\nAmong other rent payments, the arbitrators determined that the Devils owe $1.5 million for the sports and job training programs for those three years. The hockey team also owes an additional $2,738 for the first year, according to the decision.\n\nBut instead of getting money back, city officials end up owing money to the Devils, because of parking revenues and other issues addressed in the arbitrators\u2019 decision.\n\nOur ruling\n\nIn an interview on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe, Booker claimed Vanderbeek \"froze all those monies during the toughest years in \u201808-\u201909\" and \"refused to give the charitable dollars that he was required to give by the contract.\"\n\nAccording to the arbitrators\u2019 decision, the Devils paid $346,576 toward youth and community sports programs and job training programs for the first year of the contract. But the hockey team did not pay $1.5 million in combined payments over the next three years of the contract.\n\nWe rate the statement Mostly True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLee Leffingwell\n\n\nstated on February 25, 2011 in State of the City address.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays four-year terms for City Council members are \"the norm in most cities of our size.\"\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy W.
