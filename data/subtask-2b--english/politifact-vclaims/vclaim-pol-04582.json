It doesn\u2019t matter to him that illegal immigration and the crime rate are as low as they\u2019ve been in decades, because he\u2019s not offering any real solutions to those issues. He\u2019s just offering slogans, and he\u2019s offering fear. He\u2019s betting that if he scares enough people, he might score just enough votes to win this election.\"\nTrump did, in fact, call the United States \"a divided crime scene\" in a tweet. But for this fact-check, we're going to focus on Obama's claim about illegal immigration and crime.\nImmigration rates\nThere is no reliable count of illegal immigration. Obviously, people coming into the United States illegally are trying to avoid detection.\nThe best indicator available is the number of people apprehended by the U.S. Border Patrol, an imperfect metric because some people can be double-counted if they are apprehended twice, for example.\nThose data show a mostly steady decline to 337,117 apprehensions in the 2015 fiscal year. In contrast, apprehensions peaked in 2000, when more than 1.6 million were logged.\nTo see a lower nationwide apprehension rate you would have to go back 44 years, to 1971.\n(The vast majority of those apprehensions in 2015 \u2014 98 percent \u2014 were along the southwest border.)\nAnother important caveat to note is that rates don't necessarily equate to enforcement, which has gotten stricter in recent years. Also, the number of people attempting to cross is tied to economic conditions, which aren't always under control of a president.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in remarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrime rates\nContrary to what Trump has repeatedly contended, the crime rate in the United States has been on the decline for years.\nThere's been some preliminary data from early 2015 and partial comparisons as late as early 2016 indicating an uptick, but the overall trend through 2014 from annual data compiled by the FBI \u2014 using reports submitted by local law enforcement agencies \u2014 show that violent crime has been falling steadily since the early 1990s.\n\nThe trend for property crime is similar. In addition, annual statistics collected by the Justice Department for the National Crime Victimization Survey shows the same trends.\nOur ruling\nObama said, \"Illegal immigration and the crime rate are as low as they\u2019ve been in decades.\"\nThe data generally support his claim, but the numbers aren't perfect.\nThere's a hint of a recent uptick in crime based on partial and preliminary data from 2015 and 2016, and estimates of illegal immigration have to rely on border patrol apprehensions because it's impossible to directly count the number of people sneaking into the United States.\nWith those words of caution in mind, we rate Obama's claim Mostly True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7b8d1f60-5715-4cd5-9bf2-999919183a31", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04582"}
