He issued the \"loss\" announcement, which criticized Sullivan for not doing enough to prevent the closure of the Coach Refinery, which resulted in the loss of 80 jobs. \"Dan Sullivan remains silent about the jobs that are lost here,\" said the ad. And these billionaires themselves, the Coach brothers, are supporting his campaign. The next week, Sullivan made a radio announcement: \"Dan Sullivan didn't take a cent from the Coach brothers,\" the novelist said. \"It's Peji\u0107 who took the campaign money from Kochz.\" As a democracy, Peji\u0107 will not be a typical recipient of Coch's money. So we decided to check whether the attack was accurate. Our colleagues in Factcheck.org pointed out that although Sullivan did not accept money directly from the Koch brothers or their subsidiaries, the Coch-backed Americans spent nearly $1 million on the announcement of the attack on Peji\u0107. Sullivan doesn't receive that money, but he benefits from an attack on his opponent that cannot be coordinated directly legally between the candidate and the group. As for Peji\u0107, we found that the Company of Kuprak, a group of Koch Industries, provided $5,000 to the Big Land Ownership Company of Peji\u0107 in 2010. In the first place, the Peji\u0107 party grants funds to candidates, as well as to the democratic parties of the states and federations. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" By Samantha Buterman: January 11, 2021 in 2010, Coch also gave money to members of the Democratic Senate, such as Mary Landrio, Mark Brewer and Chuck Schommer. In 2013 and 2014, they gave no funds to the candidates of the Democratic Senate and only three candidates from the Democratic House of Representatives. A spokesman for the non-partisan Center for Responsive Policy, which runs OpenSecrets.org, said that she would be surprised to see a lot of Coach's money going to Democrats at this session. In March 2014, a spokesman for Coach Pol\u00edtico Industries reported that Cochebek was not based on the candidate &apos; s party &apos; s donations, but on the company &apos; s business and policy interests. Our judgment, Sullivan, said Mark Peji\u0107 took the campaign money from the Coachs, but Sullivan didn't take a cent. In 2010, KochPAC donated $5,000 to PAC Peji\u0107. However, this is a modest amount according to the election campaign funding criteria, and Peji\u0107 has not received any more in the past four years. While Sullivan did not receive the money directly from Kochs, it is certain that the other Republican challengers Peji\u0107 are benefiting from the larger television advertisements purchased by the Koch-affiliated groups that attack the Democrats. A group funded by Coach, American for Prosperity, spent nearly $1 million in Alaska for Sullivan and other Republicans in the race. We're assessing this allegation mostly wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00301"}
