Because on January 10th, Nicole Kidman, a Hollywood A-lister, dared to go against the Hollywood agenda and told an interviewer that \u2018we need to support whoever is the president.\u2019\"\u00a0\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nIt\u2019s true that Kidman said Americans should support then-President-elect Donald Trump.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn a Jan. 10, 2017, interview with Victoria Derbyshire on BBC Two, Derbyshire says that Kidman has dual citizenship and voted in the U.S. elections and then asks what Kidman thinks of Trump.\u00a0\n\"I\u2019m always reticent to start sort of commenting politically, I\u2019ve never done it in terms of America or Australia, I\u2019m issue-based,\" she said, before adding, \"He\u2019s now elected and we as a country need to support whosever the president because that\u2019s what the country\u2019s based on. And however that happened, he\u2019s there and let\u2019s go.\"\nKidman then pivoted to discussing her commitment to \"women\u2019s issues\" and fundraising for breast and ovarian cancer.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the Washington Post reported at the time, Kidman was quickly criticized on social media. The newspaper also noted that Kidman\u2019s comments were in stark contrast to those of many other celebrities, including Meryl Streep, who had recently given a speech critical of Trump while accepting a Golden Globe award.\nOthers, including Kelly Osbourne, advocated for giving Trump a chance.\u00a0\n\"We have to give him a chance,\" Osbourne then said. \"And we do it by spreading love, not hate.\"\u00a0\nSeveral days after Kidman\u2019s BBC Two interview, Kidman clarified that her comments were about her belief in democracy, and that she wasn\u2019t endorsing Trump, the Associated Press reported.\u00a0\n\"I was trying to stress that I believe in democracy and the American Constitution, and it was that simple,\" she told Access Hollywood.\u00a0\nBut we couldn\u2019t find any credible evidence that Kidman has been blacklisted from Hollywood. She attended the 2017 Academy Awards, where she was a nominee for best supporting actress, and since her comments, she\u2019s appeared in movies including: \"Boy Erased,\" \"Aquaman,\" and \"The Goldfinch.\" She\u2019s also been an executive producer on several projects.\u00a0\nShe\u2019s also starred in the HBO show \"Big Little Lies\" alongside Meryl Streep. In September, USA Today reported that it was Streep who convinced Kidman to take the role of ex-\"Fox & Friends\" host Gretchen Carlson in \"Bombshell,\" which is in theaters now.\u00a0\nIf evidence emerges that Kidman was blacklisted from Hollywood because of her support for Trump, we\u2019ll reconsider our rating. Evidence available now indicates it\u2019s False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17569"}
