This photo, which was published by a Facebook page called Tactical Hospitality, presents a variety of allegations about Omar, some of which relate to previous verifications of the facts concerning her family's history and comments on Al-Qaida. Two new allegations for us: the article says that Omar was \"arrested 23 times\" and \"daughter of (a) Somali terrorist.\" \"From the prison cell, to Congress,\" claims the photograph, which contains photos of Omar's alleged footage and one of her oaths to Congresswoman. The article was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The Polyte Fact came to tactical hospitality to see where you got the picture. The page told us that \"I cut it off from someone who shared it\" and that she was not sure of its origin. When we considered the allegations, we found that Omar had not been arrested 23 times and there was no evidence to suggest that any of her parents were involved with terrorist organizations. We examined public records in 2013 and found that Omar was arrested once - not 23 times. The Facebook bulletin confused the congresswoman's violations of traffic and arrests. Snoops verified a related allegation that the actor was \"arrested in 2013 for trespassing.\" The article contains the same picture as the one shown by tactical hospitality. Snoops estimated this term to be correct. The fact-finding examiner referred to the police report issued in January 2013. She says Omar was arrested on two counts of misdemeanours for trespassing and refusing to leave the Minneapolis Hotel. She was booked at Henbin County Prison. She was 30 years old. Subsequently, charges of trespassing on Omar &apos; s property were dropped, as reported by Associated Press in October. The Congresswoman refused to leave a hotel lobby full of people following the Somali President, who was in town to give a speech. Omar snuck back inside after the police cleared the lobby. Polyte Fact could not find the incident in a public database of the Minnesota Court records. Her campaign wasn't suspended. On January 12, 2021, he wrote in an Instagram article saying that Joe Biden remained silent about the violence in Black Lives-Mite protests. By Tom Kircher: January 16, 2021 parking tickets, what we found in the database was 24 traffic tickets from the past 10 years, the last of which was the parking ticket from January, and the last of which was the parking ticket. Under Minnesota law, conviction means \"guilty plea; guilty plea by jury or guilty plea by court.\" The other 23 charges include a number of parking violations, as well as two expired pages and one speeding offence. In the winter of 2016, Omar paid two tickets for not following the \"mysterious emergency parking restrictions,\" which specified specific times when drivers could not stand on certain routes. The time of imprisonment is not included in any of these traffic violations - the accusation of minor offences is not the same as the one arrested. Polyte Fact contacted Minneapolis Police Department for further details on Omar's record. The Police Records Information Unit sent us a document indicating that Omar was arrested only once - in 2013 for trespassing. The second allegation on Facebook is much more serious, claiming that Omar is the daughter of a Somali terrorist. A spokesman for the Omar office sent two articles containing information on Omar &apos; s curriculum vitae, without further elaboration. In November 2016, the City Pages, an alternate newspaper in twin cities, reported that Um Omar died when she was young. Before the outbreak of the civil war in the early 1990s, her father trained teachers in Somalia. The family was sent to a refugee camp in Kenya during the conflict, and the Washington Post reported on 6 July. They were granted asylum in the United States in 1995 and eventually settled in Minneapolis, where Omar's father worked as a taxi driver, and later in a post office. We have not been able to find any evidence that my father Omar was a terrorist or war criminal in Somalia. Similarly, Snoops was unable to determine whether Omar's father, Nur Omar Mohamed, was a \"war criminal\" in Somalia, as alleged by the Bondet Gate, in order to verify the facts on 25 July. On 16 July, the conservative news site, Poletti Fruitte, reported that Omar &apos; s father had been associated with Siad Bree, President of Somalia, from 1969 to 1991. However, as Snoops noted, the portal did not provide evidence of this. Instead, the site mentioned another man, Yusuf Abdi Ali, who claimed - without evidence - that the two were connected. (Here's more of it from CNN's report.) Our referee claims a viral picture on Facebook that Elhan Omar was arrested 23 times, the daughter of a Somali terrorist. She was arrested once and the charges were dropped. Minnesota court records show that Omar has been subjected to 24 traffic violations over the past 10 years, not arrests. We have found no evidence of the involvement of any of Omar &apos; s parents in a terrorist organization in Somalia. The job is not accurate. We assess it wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00275"}
