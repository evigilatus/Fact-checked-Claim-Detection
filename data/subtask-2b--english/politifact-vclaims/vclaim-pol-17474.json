In an ad that aired during the Feb. 25 Democratic presidential debate in Charleston, S.C., the Committee to Defend the President urged African Americans to turn their backs on Biden.\nHere\u2019s the ad\u2019s text:\n\"Joe Biden promised to help our community. It was a lie. Here is President Obama: \u2018Plantation politics. Black people in the worst jobs, the worst housing, police brutality rampant. But when the so-called black committeemen came around election time, we\u2019d all line up and vote the straight Democratic ticket, sell our souls for a Christmas turkey.\u2019 Enough. Joe Biden won\u2019t represent us, defend us or help us. Don\u2019t believe Biden\u2019s empty promises.\"\nWe\u2019ve seen this quote from Obama before. The same PAC used exactly the same material in November to attack Democrats in general for failing the black community.\nWe rated it Pants on Fire. Here\u2019s why.\nWhat Obama wrote in his book\nThe voice in the ad sounds like Obama dramatizing someone else\u2019s words, and the words were not his own views. They came from Obama reading from his 1995 book \"Dreams From My Father\" about his days as a community organizer in Chicago. He recounted his conversation with a barber he called Smitty about Chicago\u2019s first black mayor, Harold Washington.\nSmitty explains Chicago politics to Obama, who told the barber he was not in Chicago for the election of Washington.\nHere\u2019s how the scene plays in the book:\n\"Had to be here before Harold to understand what he means to this city,\" Smitty said. \"Before Harold, seemed like we\u2019d always be second-class citizens.\"\n\"Plantation politics,\" the man with the newspaper said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL. Lin Wood\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in an interview with the Patriotically Correct Radio Show\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"China was behind the interference and the effort to overthrow our government and the election, election fraud.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Daniel Funke \u2022 January 19, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That\u2019s just what it was, too,\" Smitty said. \"A plantation. Black people in the worst jobs. The worst housing. Police brutality rampant. But when the so-called black committeemen came around election time, we'd all line up and vote the straight Democratic ticket. Sell our souls for a Christmas turkey. White folks spitting in our faces, and we\u2019d reward \u2018em with the vote.\"\nIn his book, Obama then described the power of African Americans to shape their political destiny when they are unified.\nObama wrote:\u00a0\n\"They had turned out in record numbers on election night, ministers and gang-bangers, young and old. And their faith had been rewarded.\"\nIn Smitty\u2019s words, \"The night Harold won, let me tell you, people just ran the streets \u2026 ,\" he said, recounting how the community was proud of Washington and themselves. \"When I woke up the next morning, it seemed like the most beautiful day of my life.\"\nThe pro-Trump ad uses the passage to create the impression that Obama believed that black voters, ignored and suffering, sold their soul to the Democrats at election time. But the actual book passage is quoting another speaker, and talks about the good things that come from voting.\nWorse, the ad suggests Obama was talking about recent times and the failings of Joe Biden.\u00a0\nWe contacted the PAC behind the ad and they defended their use of the excerpt.\nOur ruling\nA pro-Trump ad says that Obama said black people have the \"worst jobs, the worst housing\" and face rampant police brutality, \"but when so-called black committeemen came around election time we\u2019d all line up and vote the straight Democratic ticket, sell our souls for a Christmas turkey.\"\nWhile Obama did say those words, they were not his own. In his book \"Dreams from my Father,\" Obama was describing a conversation with a Chicago barber who remembered African Americans helping elect Chicago\u2019s first black mayor.\u00a0\nThe ad creates an impression that Obama was describing the failure of Democrats, including Biden, to actually help blacks, while in reality, the passage was about a key African American election victory.\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17474"}
