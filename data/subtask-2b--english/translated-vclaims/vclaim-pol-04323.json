In a speech in Wilmington, N. S., Ken Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, said that he was even willing to host the Libyan President in 2009, two years before the killing of the Qadhafi rebels during an NATO air campaign in that country. \"When Muammar Gadavi was to visit the United Nations, and no one was allowed to stay in New York, Trump Gaddafi allowed a perfect tent to be set up in his estate in Westchester County (New York), \" said Ken, Democratic Vice-President, on 6 September. Sarah Beck, Director of Communications, Virginia, on the Hillary Clinton Democratic Presidential Election Campaign, referred to an article on the tent ring on June 7 in Bazved News. Bazved examined the rental of his property to Jedafi during the Libyan leader &apos; s September 2009 trip to New York City, where the dictator addressed the United Nations General Assembly. Bazved observed that when Jadafi travelled, he often did so with a tent like North Africa, where he could stay for one night. Before the trip to New York, Libyan officials sought permission to set up a tent in Central Park in Manhattan, but according to press reports, a North African dictator's request was rejected. They also sought to put the tent in Angloud, N. Instead, the tent was set up at the Tramp Seven Springs farm in Bedford, a suburb in the north of New York City. The Journal News, a local newspaper covering that city, published an article on September 24, 2009, which states that Gadhavi intends to entertain guests on Trump. The Libyan camps included a camel-stained tent, a couch, chairs, satellite-based chairs and a fire pit. These dwellings were placed without the consent of officials in Bedford, who were misled by the possibility that the notorious dictator was going to visit their city. In the midst of this debate, the media went down to the high neighborhood surrounding Trump's property to write down the tent shelf. Bedford officials ordered the tent to go down, saying it was violating zoning laws. Trump, speaking on his behalf, said in a statement that he had asked the Libyans to drop the tent. The Libyans complied but only for a period of time. They republished it among the reports that Jedhavi was planning to visit the drug. The city officials, under police escort, entered the property and ordered that the tent be struck again. The tent was again dropped and withdrawn the following day. Check the facts (Kirk Cox) was mentioned on January 13, 2021 in a speech. Virginia ranked lowest third of the states in the management of the COVID-19 vaccine. \u2022 On January 20, 2012, Joel Sachs, a Bedford town attorney, told us that there was no evidence that my jade had reached the drug. Local news reports say the Libyan leader never saw the drug. In 2009, Sachs told the Journal of the Journal News that the real estate officials said that one of Jadhavi's sons ventured into seven springs. My appeal ended up staying in the United Nations Libyan Mission in Central Manhattan. This week, Sachs told us that in 2009, Trump denied to city officials that he knew that Jadhavi was renting space in his property, and told the town that he believed it was rented by some of his business partners in the Middle East. Saxe said he didn't find the denial reasonable and told us that the real estate officials indicated that Trump was aware of Jadafi's plans to use the drug. The Associated Press Agency noted that in the years following the workshop, Trump admitted that he had rented the property to Jedafi. \"I've made a lot of money with Jadhavi,\" said Trump on June 5, 2016, an interview on CBS \"Face the Nation.\" \"If you remember, he came into the country, and he had to make a deal with me because he needed a place to stay. He paid me a fortune, and he couldn't stay there. And it kind of became a big joke, \"Trump said. During an interview five years ago in Fox News, Trump made similar comments. \"I rented him a piece of land... and then I didn't let him use the land,\" said Trump, according to a copy of Fox's interview on March 21, 2011, \"I don't want to use the word \"fuck,\" but I tricked him. That's what we should do. I rented him a piece of land in Bedford, New York. I rented him a piece of land. He paid me a fortune, and I didn't let him use the land.\" Trump also addressed this issue in an interview by CNN in 2011. \"What did you do with Jadhavi? I rented him a piece of land for his tent, \"He said Trump. In his article, Bazvid stated that a Libyan garrison had stayed on Trump for weeks before Jadevi's visit to New York, as had members of a public relations company representing Libya. Our Governor Kane said: \"When Muammar Gadvi was planning to visit the United Nations, and no one allowed him to stay in New York, Trump Gaddafi allowed a perfect tent to be set up in his estate in Westchester County (New York). There is no doubt that Jadhavi rented a place on Trump to put his tent. Trump now admits that he rented the land to Jaddafi, although he paints it as bragging to show that he mocked the Libyan leader with a lot of money. We also appreciate Kane's well-being. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/206b9f0-024b-44e5-b95b-c34a90096d5", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04323"}
