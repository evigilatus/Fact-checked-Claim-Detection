Three other members of the U.S. service were injured, according to the U.S. Central Command. The attack showed obvious flaws in the Benes assessment. (In a statement issued later the same day after the attack, he avoided similar language, saying, \"The American people can be assured, for the sake of our soldiers, their families and our nation, that we will never allow the remains of ISIS to re-establish their evil and deadly successor - not now, not ever). We asked what the basis for the Penny allegation was in the Foreign Ministry's letter. The Penny Office did not respond to any query. However, we have reached a broad agreement among half a dozen experts studying terrorism and foreign policy: ISIS's land holdings have shrunk considerably, but even before the Manbeig attack, the group could not be described as \"destructed.\" With regard to the restoration of ISIL lands, there has been success - and significant spillover effects. A report issued by IHS Markit in June 2017 concluded that ISIS had lost \"over 60 per cent of its territory and 80 per cent of its revenues\" by that point. This included \"a steady decline in all financial flows to the group: oil production and smuggling, taxation and confiscation, and other illegal activities.\" In addition, the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) said, \"The group's video productions have declined in frequency, indicating that they are less able to disseminate their messages.\" A few months later, on 21 December 2017, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs gave a briefing to Brett McGurk - then Special Presidential Envoy of the Global Alliance against ISIS - a higher figure: 98 per cent of the land lost. McGurke added that \"7.7 million people (who) lived under ISIS no longer lived under ISIS.\" A year later, McGurke actually raised this to 99 per cent, saying at a media meeting of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, \"We are now really going down to the last 1 per cent of the physical area.\" In protest against President Donald Trump &apos; s announcement that he would withdraw his forces from Syria - forces for which many were responsible in helping keep ISIL under surveillance, McGork later resigned. This map, published by the Congressional Non-Party Research Department, illustrates the extent of the losses to ISIS until August 2018: at the same time, however, these losses in the territories \"induc the Islamic State to intensify its campaign of terrorist attacks abroad to compensate them,\" as the ICHR report said. ISIS still has members available to carry out such attacks, such as those alleged in Manbaj. On 13 January 2021, the distinguished fact-finding bloggers announced in a story in which General David H. Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request to use the Marines for opening security, saying, \"We are not working for you.\" It is estimated that there are 30,000 remaining ISIL members. For the context, \"this is the equivalent of two divisions of the U.S. Army, many times the \"thousands\" fighters were the base before 9/11,\" said John Pike, Director of Global Security.org. Experts said that ISIS fighters were far from helpless. \"I don't know any reliable analysis consistent with the idea that ISIS has been defeated,\" said Dave Gartenstein Ross, a terrorist specialist with the ISIL Democracy Foundation for his advisory group, Valens Global. The attack in Manbij was \"one in a variety of attacks in both Syria and Iraq indicating that ISIL is returning as a rebel movement,\" said Gartenstein Ross. For example, the Institute for the Study of War, which followed ISIS activity, recently wrote that ISIS \"intensifies its campaign to destabilize\" Raqqah, the former capital of ISIS. ISIS detonated a car bomb there on November 4, 2018 -- the first such attack since the city was taken by the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant also \"maintains a support area in the rural desert in central Syria\" and appears to maintain \"access to the Syrian-Jordanian and Syrian-Iraqi borders, as well as the main crossroads in Palmera in central Syria,\" according to the Institute for the Study of War. The group also used \"a dense network of caves and tunnels\" to avoid detection. The terrorist experts contacted by Polyte Factus were global in their agreement that the \"defeated\" penny comment was wrong. \u2022 Michael O'Hanlon, a foreign policy specialist at the Brookings Institution, said \"not defeated in any way.\" \u2022 \"The succession has collapsed, but the terrorist threat from the Islamic State is alive and extremely dangerous,\" said Bruce Riedel, director of the Brookings Intelligence Project. \u2022 Mark Ham, a criminal scientist specializing in terrorism from Indiana University, said that the Islamic Information System (ISIS) was not the same as between 2014 and 2016, but was not defeated. \u2022 \"Defeat\" was not only inaccurate, as Bruce Hoffmann, a professor at Edmund A. Walsh Foreign Service College at Georgetown University, said, but also referred to \"a misunderstanding of terrorism as a phenomenon that can \"be defeated in conventional military terms.\" McGork said the same during his 2017 and 2018 briefings. Less than a month before the Benes speech, McGurk said: \"Even as the end of physical succession is now clearly approaching, the end of ISIS will be a much longer-term initiative. No one declares the mission accomplished. \"Defeating physical succession is a phase of a long-term campaign.\" The White House even recognized this in its national counter-terrorism strategy, which was issued in October 2018. The report states: \"Global access remains strong, with eight official branches and more than 20 networks regularly conducting terrorist and insurgent operations throughout Africa, Asia, Europe and the Middle East.\" \"Despite many setbacks, ISIL maintains a sophisticated and permanent media and an Internet presence that allows it to encourage sympathizers around the world and enable them to launch dozens of attacks within targeted countries, including the United States. The increase in attacks by violent mobsters in the United States confirms ISIS &apos; s ability to inspire terrorist attacks.\" Our referee Pines said, \"Caliphate collapsed and Adesh was defeated.\" The experts agree that the succession between ISIL has essentially ended. However, falling succession does not mean that ISIS has \"beaten,\" not by a long shot. Even the White House itself admitted this fact only three months ago. We're mostly assessing the statement wrong.
