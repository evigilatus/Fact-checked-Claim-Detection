Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., touted one of President Barack Obama\u2019s key agenda items -- raising the federal minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $10.10 an hour.\nRaising the minimum wage to $10.10, Schumer said, \"is important for one reason, and very important to us, which is, it's the bare minimum. You work 40 hours a week, you get out of poverty.\"\nThe trouble with Schumer\u2019s claim is that the accepted definition of poverty is actually a sliding scale that depends on the size of a family.\nWe\u2019ll walk you through the math.\nWhat raising the minimum wage means\nEarning $10.10 an hour for 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, produces a yearly gross income of $21,008.\nBut people earning that amount also have a good chance of getting money back from the government through the Earned Income Tax Credit -- a provision of tax law that encourages work by low-income Americans. If your income is low enough -- but if you have a paying job -- the government supplements your income through refundable tax credits.\nUsing the calculator at the IRS website, we created some sample taxpaying households. Both have two parents, only one of whom worked, and no complicated tax quirks. One had two children and the other had three.\nWhen we input the new minimum-wage level annual income of $21,008, the calculator told us that the EITC would provide an additional $5,370 to the family with two children and $6,040 to the family with three children. (EITC benefits are capped at three children.)\nSo, combined, a hypothetical family of four would get $26,378 in gross income, and a hypothetical family of five would get $27,048. (The size of the tax credit can vary a bit depending on the taxpayer\u2019s situation, but this at least shows the scale we\u2019re talking about.)\nIs this enough to \"get out of poverty\"?\nWould this be enough to escape poverty? As we noted earlier, the size of the family makes a big difference.\nThe poverty level is not a single threshold, but rather a series of them scaled to the size of the household. (Caution for any statistical geeks reading this: There are actually two poverty federal levels, one calculated by the Census Bureau and one by the Department of Health and Human Services. They track each other pretty closely, but there are some small differences. We calculated our data both ways, and our overall conclusions held regardless of which measure we used. For simplicity, though, we\u2019re only going to show our calculations for the HHS poverty line.)\nUsing the HHS numbers for 2014, the poverty line is $11,670 for a one-person household, $15,730 for a two-person household, $19,790 for a three-person household, $23,850 for a four-person household, and up from there with the addition of each new person.\nSince the new $10.10 wage would be fully phased in by 2016 (if it\u2019s passed by Congress) we estimated what these poverty guidelines would be in 2016. We did this by increasing the 2014 guidelines by the same percentage as the guidelines increased between 2012 and 2014, which is the most recent two-year period.\nThis produced the following estimated poverty guidelines for 2016:\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPersons in household\n\n\nPoverty guideline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n$12,193\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n$16,354\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Godlewski\n\n\nstated on January 9, 2021 in Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all women that lost jobs (in the December jobs report), it was mostly Black and Latina women. In fact, white women gained employment.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Nusaiba Mizan \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n$20,516\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n$24,678\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n$28,839\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n$33,003\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n$37,165\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n$41,329\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nSo if one breadwinner earns a total of $26,378, then the new $10.10 wage, plus an EITC refund, is indeed enough to lift households of one, two, three, and four people beyond the poverty level. But it would be too small to lift the households of five people or more. (The additional EITC refund for a third child isn\u2019t large enough to make a difference.)\nIn other words, while raising the wage to $10.10 does get a lot of households out of poverty, it isn\u2019t quite the guarantee that Schumer suggests.\nIn addition, raising the minimum wage to $10.10 doesn\u2019t get any one-person households out of poverty, because even the current federal minimum wage of $7.25 does that.\nTo measure how \"right\" or \"wrong\" Schumer\u2019s claim is, we wanted to measure what proportion of minimum-wage-worker households included one person, two persons, and so on. But experts told us there is no readily available data on this point. So we used the next best data we could find -- the Census Bureau\u2019s distribution of impoverished households by the size of household.\nThe three household sizes that get boosted out of poverty due to a wage hike to $10.10 -- households of two, three and four people -- collectively account for 46 percent of all households in poverty, according to this Census data.\nThe remaining 54 percent either are out of poverty already at the current minimum wage (one-person households) or wouldn\u2019t exceed the poverty line even after getting a raise to $10.10 an hour (households of at least five people).\nBy that measure, Schumer is right a little less than half the time. These are estimates, but experts said these estimates are reasonable given the available data.\nA spokesman for Schumer said the statistic came from calculations by the Council of Economic Advisers, an office within the White House. (You can see a chart on page 6 in the slide show here.)\nThe White House chart hangs its poverty-lifting claim on data for a four-person family, which squares with what we found. The problem with Schumer\u2019s claim is that he glossed over some caveats and made too sweeping a case for the power of a $10.10 wage increase to knock out poverty.\nOur ruling\nSchumer said a new minimum wage of \"$10.10 is important for one reason \u2026 It's the bare minimum. You work 40 hours a week, you get out of poverty.\"\nRaising the wage to $10.10 an hour does indeed put two-, three- and four-person households with one working member above the poverty line for the first time. But it doesn\u2019t achieve a similar feat for one-person households (which already exceed the poverty line under the old, $7.25 wage) or for households of five or more people (who still wouldn\u2019t earn enough with the $10.10 wage to escape poverty).\nSince the households helped by the $10.10 wage account for 46 percent of all impoverished households, Schumer is right slightly less than half the time. We rate his claim Half True.\nUPDATE, May 8, 3:15 p.m.: This item has been updated to clarify what calculations we made when determining the percentage of minimum wage workers's households who would be lifted out of poverty due to a rise to $10.10.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07883"}
