Alan Grayson, an Orlando-area Democrat, made a case against assault rifles after the shooting in Orlando, arguing that the gun\u2019s rate of fire is what made the death toll so catastrophic.\nIf the shooter, Omar Mateen, \"was not able to buy a weapon that shoots off 700 rounds in a minute, a lot of those people would still be alive,\" Grayson said June 12, in an interview with CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett.\n\"If somebody like him had nothing worse\u00a0to deal with than a glock pistol which was his other weapon today, he might have killed three or four people and not 50,\" Grayson said.\nLaw enforcement officials have not released specific details regarding the nature of the rifle\u00a0Mateen used in the shooting as of this fact-check. Law enforcement officials have described it as an \"AR\u00a0type rifle.\" The gun shop owner who sold Mateen the weapon told the New York Post it was\u00a0a Sig Sauer MCX rifle. \u00a0\nGrayson told PolitiFact he was referring to the AR-15 weapon more generally, which was modeled off the military style M16.\nAll these details matter, and what makes Grayson's claim problematic.\u00a0Experts told us the weapon Mateen used could not fire 700 rounds in a minute without serious alterations that require the resources of a gun manufacturer. Even if Mateen had those resources, and there is no indication from sounds recorded from the shooting or from investigators that he did, experts are not even sure if Grayson\u2019s 700-rounds-per-minute claim is possible.\nExperts said that firing 700 rounds per minute is unrealistic due to the time it would take for a shooter to reload magazines and because the gun would overheat.\nWhat Grayson said later\nBoth the AR-15 and Sig Sauer MCX\u00a0rifle are sold for civilian use as a semiautomatic rifle, meaning a shooter has to pull the trigger to fire each round. This is different from an automatic weapon where the shooter can hold down the trigger and shoot multiple rounds.\nThe AR-15\u00a0weapon was used in the 2015 San Bernadino and 2012 Sandy Hook shootings, and has since been the subject of controversy, including a lawsuit against an AR-15 manufacturer.\nMateen used an \"AR type rifle,\" according to the\u00a0Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Some people, like Grayson,\u00a0took that to mean an AR-15. The\u00a0Sig Sauer MCX, however, looks like an AR-15 and is considered an AR type rifle.\u00a0\nGrayson clarified his specific claim in other\u00a0interviews\u00a0to say that\u00a0rifle Mateen used was only capable of 700 rounds per minute when modified to become an automatic weapon, such as the M16 military version of the civilian AR-15.\nGrayson told PolitiFact that there are various ways of converting weapons\u00a0from semi-automatic to automatic, some legal (purchasing a shoulder mount) and others illegal (\"machining\" the weapon).\nGary Kleck, Florida State University criminologist, said that it would be possible to \"convert\" a semiautomatic rifle into an automatic rifle, but only \"if you had the resources of a modern rifle manufacturer\" and sufficient tools.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharlie Crist\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2010 in a news release\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Speaker Rubio supported gun restrictions that included background checks and waiting periods.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Lee Logan \u2022 February 26, 2010\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKleck\u2019s research on guns recovered by police suggests that rarely happens. If shooters do use an automatic weapon, they probably stole it from a military armory rather than repurposing a civilian version, Kleck said.\nTheory vs. reality\nGrayson\u2019s claim distorts what we know about the Orlando shooting and the number of rounds a standard semiautomatic rifle\u00a0can fire.\nThe 700-round-a-minute figure is only a theoretical benchmark, not something achievable in reality.\nArmy documents\u00a0list the M16 as having a \"cyclic rate of fire\" of 700-900 rounds per minute. However, the \"cyclic\" rate of fire is a theoretical measurement of speed, not how many rounds could actually be shot out of the gun in 1 minute, said Michael O\u2019Shea, a constitutional law professor at Oklahoma City University.\n\"That only means how rapidly the firing mechanism operates while there is ammunition in the gun,\" O\u2019Shea said. \"It is not the same as being able to actually discharge 700 rounds of ammunition from the gun in 60 seconds.\"\nFor starters, a shooter would have to reload his magazines to achieve that volume \u2014 at least 20 times with 30 round magazines or 6 times with 100 round magazines, which are less commonly used, O\u2019Shea said.\nGrayson told PolitiFact that there are videos online of people shooting at 700-900 rounds per minute. However, we searched online for such videos and found that they actually confirmed O'Shea's point.\u00a0\nThe Army document designates the \"maximum effective rate of fire\" \u2014 \"the highest rate of fire that can be maintained and still achieve target hits\"\u00a0\u2014 as 150-200 rounds per minute for an automatic M16. Kleck added that, from his research on mass shootings, most shooters rarely fire more than 50 rounds per minute.\nEven if you could overcome the need to reload \u2014 by installing a belt of ammunition \u2014 reaching 700 rounds in one minute remains infeasible, said Steven Howard, a lawyer and gun expert who has consulted with various law enforcement agencies.\n\"In reality, you\u2019ll get to 500 rounds and the gun will just melt,\" Howard said.\nOur ruling\nGrayson said that the rifle Mateen used \"shoots off 700 rounds in a minute.\"\nOn CNN, he includes this claim without any clarification. In other forums, he noted that his claim is only true for the hypothetical semiautomatic rifle\u00a0converted to an automatic weapon.\nEven then, however, experts say the 700-round-per-minute figure is not an accurate portrayal of rounds fired. This is true for many reasons, they said, including reloading time and the potential of overheating the gun.\nThe debate over how assault weapons ought to be regulated is ongoing and contentious, but the claim Grayson uses is nonetheless misleading.\nWe rate this claim Mostly False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/3d2e9d05-7942-4a9b-b6c1-efbf9096fc5f", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04834"}
