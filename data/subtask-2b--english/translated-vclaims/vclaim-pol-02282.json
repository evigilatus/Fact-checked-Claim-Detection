Another Dim recently added... does anyone think that's fair? However, there is no consensus! -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTromp) 18 March 2018 here, we will take a closer look at Trump's assertion that Muller's team has 13 \"hard democracy,\" and some of Hillary Clinton's supporters, and there are no Republicans. (The White House did not respond to a query on this article.) How many Democrats and Republicans are on the Mueller team? The Office of the Special Counsel announced the identity of 17 of the lawyers &apos; staff until 21 March. A summary of their background is contained in the present report. Through public records, we have been able to assert independently that at least 12 of Mueller's employees are registered Democrats. The ones that we have confirmed are Greg Andr\u00e9s, Rush Atkinson, Ryan Dickie, Michael Derbin, Kyle Freni, Andrew Goldstein, Adam Jade, Elizabeth Brellogar, James Quarles, Jean Rey, Brandon Van Grac, Andrew Weissman. Another member of the Mueller-Aron Zelinski Group - was reported to be a Democrat registered by both the Washington Post and the Daily Kaller. As the Daily Caller reported, Zelinski wrote, \"I am a democracy,\" in the Hovengton postpost that supports same-sex marriage in November 2012. In the meantime, we were able to confirm independently that two other members of Mueller-Scott Messler and Aaron Zeppeley's staff were registered to vote but did not choose a party affiliation. We were unable to confirm independently the situation of two other staff members, Zainab Ahmed and Brian M. Richardson. According to the Daily Caller newspaper, Ahmed appears to have registered as an 18-year-old Republican, but has since changed her registration status to an unaffiliated one. We will also note that Democrats are the dominant party in the jurisdictions where M\u00f8ller's lawyers live - particularly in the District of Columbia, Maryland and New York - meaning that many races are effectively decided in the initial democratic elections rather than in the general elections. However, Trump &apos; s assertion that there are no Republicans in the Group is undermined by the fact that his leader is Muller, who is registered as a Republican in the province of Colombia. M\u00f8ller was appointed to posts by Republican Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, as well as Democrats Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. In addition, Muller was appointed by Rod Rosenstein, who was nominated as Deputy Attorney General by Trump himself, and who was previously appointed as American lawyer by George W. Bush (and later retained by Obama). The Daily Caller also reported that M\u00f8ller sometimes donated to the public both at the state and national levels. Fox News referred to Mueller as \"the only known Republican\" on the team. It is worth mentioning the importance of the word \"known,\" since other officials of the Federal Bureau of Investigation or the Ministry of Justice are assisting in the investigation in some cases. The Office of the Special Adviser informed Polyte Factte that the names of investigative and office support staff had not been made public. Robinalt, a lawyer in Cleveland who runs a continuing legal education class in Watergate and his lessons, said that FBI agents in particular were helping to gather evidence. Robinalt said: \"Come on all political lines, although most of them are not politically active.\" The FBI agents, like most law enforcement officials, tend to be conservatives, law and order, so my guess is that most of them tend to be Republicans or conservative Democrats, or just ordinary independents. So Trump uses some sleight of hand to say that there are \"zero Republicans\" in the Muller team. The team is led by a registered Republican, and there may be other registered Republicans working with Muller who simply do not know their identity. How many members of the team supported Clinton? Trump also has a point of view here, but it is worth keeping the volume of donations in context. Two of the 13 publicly known employees donated what might be described as \"big\" amounts to the 2016 Clinton campaign -- Quarles, $2,700, and Rey, $5,400. During the 2016 campaign cycle, $2,700 was the maximum individual contribution to the campaign. Such a contribution can be made twice - once for the main campaign and again for the general elections. A third member of the team, Weissman, donated $2,300 to Clinton, but that was in 2007, when her first presidential election was held. (The Daily Caller reported separately that it had attended the Clinton Night Election Party in 2016. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 On January 11, 2012, three other members of the Panel contributed smaller amounts: $250 from Freni and Berlogar, and $200 from Atkinson. Does the Mueller team have \"13 solid democracies\"? How you define \"crucifixion\" is a judgment call. But if you measure contributions to the campaign, the point is covered. Seven registered Democrats do not have a check-writing record for federal candidates. According to federal disclosure data, Quarles is easily the most generous donor in the Group, providing more than $35,000 over the better part of two decades. Most of these donations went to democratic candidates or entities, but it should be noted that Quarles also made a donation totalling $2,750 to former Republicans - Virginia Goff. George Allen and former Rip, Jason Chavez. He was the only member of the team that made voluntary contributions to the Republican federal candidates. The second most generous member of the team was Rey, who gave $11.950 to Democrats in the federal races. Weissman ranked third, at $6,600, followed by Andr\u00e9s and Goldstein, both in the middle of $3,000. Freney, Brelugar, Van Grack and Atkinson also made money in federal races with donations from $200 to $800. The Daily Caller found that the additional contributions of eight staff members were just under $12,000 in state and local races. These donations were for Democrats. So the donor to the team that gave the largest amount of money is also the only donor to Republican candidates as well. Four other staff members provided between $3,000 and $12,000 over several years, four others contributed only hundreds of dollars, and seven others did not make any money at all in the federal races. How important are these affiliations? The Mueller Group has the legal right to register to vote with a party or to make personal donations. These activities are protected under the Hatch Act, originally enacted in 1939. It is also important to note that Muller was prevented from considering political affiliation when forming his team. The policy of the Ministry of Justice and the Civil Service Reform Act \"Prohibition of the use of political affiliation and may also prohibit the use of certain ideological affiliations in the recruitment and other action of employees in relation to professional lawyers,\" wrote by the Inspector General of the Ministry. Furthermore, the professional lawyers of the Mueller Group are bound by professional rules for the administration of justice and superiority over party. Every federal employee swears to \"support and defend the Constitution of the United States\" and \"doing true faith and loyalty to himself.\" The lawyers working in the federal courts are sworn in separately \"as counsel and counsel for this court, I will act honestly and in accordance with the law, and I will uphold the Constitution of the United States.\" Brett Kabul, a lawyer specializing in political law and government ethics at Akerman LLP, said that through his experience, \"the lawyers of the Ministry of Justice tend to deviate towards Democrats while the FBI agents are the overwhelming majority of Republicans. Both swear to administer justice without fear or favour with regard to the political party, and I have never seen anyone from either group act in a partisan manner. \"I don't think one should ask about party affiliation when it comes to prosecutors,\" added Robbinalt. \"They come in all the lines. The question is whether they are qualified - and as I understand it, the team is highly qualified in society.\" Robbinal said that he would not advise young lawyers of the Ministry of Justice to voluntarily abandon all political activities today for fear of being attacked if they ever joined a politically accused investigation. He said, \"It's my first amendment right and it's very important to our democracy.\" My guess is that most people will stay out of politics, but our country is built on the idea of freedom of belief and expression. One of the most recent points is the history of Trump &apos; s voluntary contributions to the American Senate campaign in Clinton ($5, $4,100) and the first presidential campaign (two, $2,300, although returned in 2009). Our rule is that Muller's team has \"13 solid democracies, some big supporters Hilary, and zero Republicans.\" The Mueller Group has 13 registered Democrats and no registered Republicans, and several members of the Group have made contributions to the Clinton campaign in various quantities. However, Trump leaves a decisively registered republic - Muller himself - and ignores the fact that we do not know the identities, or party affiliations, of other officials of the Ministry of Justice or the Federal Bureau of Investigation working with the investigation. It is also doubtful to say that many non-donors are \"strong\" democracies. We evaluate the statement half right. Correction, March 22, 2018: The article was changed to reflect that Rosenstein was \"deranged\" in his current job by Obama.
