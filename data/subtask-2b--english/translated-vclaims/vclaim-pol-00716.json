According to Missouri's previous reports, Griffith, Vice-Chairman of the former United States Army's 8th Special Forces Veterans Committee and Green Peret, said that more war veterans' therapy courts would make it easier for veterans to get to court, because some must lead \"a lot of distance\" to pursue their program every day. According to Justice for Veterans, Veterans Treatment Courts are special courts that provide an alternative to imprisonment, and provide programmes to assist veterans in the criminal justice system because of drug abuse or mental health disorders, with the assistance and treatment they need. We decided to take a closer look at Griffith &apos; s statements, to verify that every province in Texas has a war veterans &apos; treatment court. The original statement was when Griffith asked about his claim, and he was referring to what he learned from talking to the administrative assistant of the judge of the province of Gonz\u00e1lez in Texas. Griffith said he was sent to help in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey in the fall of 2017. He worked in three provinces, including Gonzales. \"I've spoken to the judge and his administrative assistant,\" said Griffith. \"His assistant told me that every county in Texas has a Veterans Court.\" We've reached out to Gonzales County to find out more. On January 14, 2021, Chuck Grasley stated in a tweet that insulin prices had \"lost the RoOOF for patients/taxpayers bc from the manufacturer, a health plan and PBM Biz practices.\" By Madison Black: 2 February 2021, District Judge C. Patrick Davis took over from Judge David Baird at the beginning of the year. Davis referred us to Chapter 124 of the Texas Government Act, Veterans' Treatment Court Program. However, neither this passage of the Texas Act nor the judge made any comment on the number of war veterans' courts in Texas. According to Texvet, treatment courts are available to veterans in 39 provinces in Texas. There are 254 provinces in Texas, much more than any other state. Texvet is an initiative of the University of Texas A&M, linking veterans and their families with resources and services. When Griffith reported our research, he said he had no reason not to believe what the assistant told him. He told us he hadn't checked whether every county in Texas had a Veterans Court but still believed that to be true. He explained: \"Maybe she was talking about the provinces surrounding San Antonio and the surrounding districts. But I considered that every county in the state has a Veterans Court.\" According to Veterans Treatment Courts: Results of the 2015 Survey, a new report prepared by the Office of Justice Programmes of the College of Public Affairs of the American University, Texas had 17 Veterans Treatment Court programmes until July 2016. According to the same survey, Michigan had the highest number in 22. According to the National Center for State Courts, the United States Department of Veterans' Affairs counted 461 court programs focusing on veterans in the United States as of 30 June 2016. Holly Schiff, TexVet Communications Coordinator, and David P. Tossie, Service Officer in the Department of Gonz\u00e1lez Veterans, did not respond to requests for suspension. Our referee Griffith said, \"Every county in Texas has a Veterans Court.\" According to data on Veterans Courts, there is no place in Texas near 254 Veterans Courts, i.e. the number of counties in the state. We're assessing the allegation wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00716"}
