Maxine Waters made a violence-inciting remark about President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.\nThe image shows an image of the California Democrat standing at a podium. It attributes this quote to her, saying she said it Sept. 17, 2018:\n\"I say, we knock off Trump and then, go after Pence. We have the power.\"\nBelow the quote, the post says:\u00a0\n\"Yes, she actually said this and then blames President Trump for inciting violence.\n\"Worth repinning! Why isn\u2019t she in jail??\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nWaters was one of the earliest elected officials supporting impeachment of Trump, calling for it just a few months after he took office in January 2017. While she didn\u2019t make this exact comment, it appears she did say something similar, but it was in the context of impeachment, not violence. Waters called for Trump\u2019s impeachment during a September 2018 event of the National Newspaper Publishers Association, which represents African American-owned community newspapers.\n\"All I want for him and about him is to be impeached and get him out of the White House,\" she said, according to a Sept. 17, 2018 article by Fox News. It continues to say that Waters said she would \"go after\" Pence if Trump were to be removed from office.\nThe article \u2014 like other websites that reported on the speech \u2014 embedded a YouTube video of her comments in the report. But that video is no longer available online. We searched Google and the Nexis news archives and found that the most extensive reporting about Waters\u2019 address came from conservative websites.\nThe American Mirror, a conservative blog by Kyle Olson, reported that after Waters said, \"All I want for him and about him is to be impeached and get him out of the White House!\"she dismissed criticism that an ousted Trump would make Pence president. Then, according to the website:\n\"Knock off the first one, and then go after the second one,\" she said.\n\"We have the power. We have the numbers, but we\u2019ve got to understand our power and we\u2019ve got to use our power.\"\nWe reached out to the National Newspaper Publishers Association to see if we could get more information about exactly what Waters said, but the organization did not respond to our request for information.\nWaters has made similar statements, before and since. Each of them were also in the context of impeachment:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJake Tapper\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in remarks in a CNN broadcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second presidential impeachment of Donald Trump was \u201cthe most bipartisan impeachment in American history.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAug. 4, 2017: Interviewed on \"The View\" TV show, Waters had this exchange with co-host Joy Behar.\nBehar: \"Do you think Pence will be better than Trump if he were impeached?\"\nWaters: \"No. And when we finish with Trump we have to go and get Putin. He\u2019s next.\"\nBehar: \"Putin or Pence?\"\u00a0\nWaters: \"Uh, Pence.\"\nOct. 20, 2017: Speaking at an event for homeless LGBTQ people in honor of a man named Ali Forney:\n\"Wow, what a moving evening this is. I'm sitting here listening, watching, absorbing, thinking about Ali even though I never met him. And with this kind of inspiration, I will go and take out Trump tonight.\"\n(CNN published the quote based on a video that has since been removed from YouTube.)\nIn an interview four days later, Waters rejected the idea that she was vowing harm to Trump: \"That's absolutely ridiculous ... that a 79-year-old grandmother who is a congresswoman and who has been in Congress and politics all these years doing any harm. The only harm I might be doing to the president is I want him impeached.\"\nSept. 8, 2018: Speaking at a Democratic club event:\nReferring to the \"highest office of the land,\" Waters said (starting at the 13:45 mark in the video): \"I wake up in the middle of the night and all I can think about is I am going to get him.\"\nAbout a minute later, Waters told the group that \"leadership\" had asked her not to say the word \"impeachment\" anymore. \"And when they say that, I say \u2018impeachment, impeachment, impeachment, impeachment,\u2019\" she said to laughter.\u00a0\nWaters also said she was told that if Trump were impeached, Pence would be worse. \"And I said, look, one at a time. You knock one down and then we\u2019ll be ready for Pence. We\u2019ll get him, too.\nWaters\u2019 office did not respond to our requests for information.\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post claimed that Waters said in September 2018: \"I say, we knock off Trump and then, go after Pence. We have the power.\"\nWe found no record that Waters made this exact statement. However, Fox News reported that Waters said something similar about Trump: \"All I want for him and about him is to be impeached and get him out of the White House,\" and that she would \"go after\" Pence if Trump were to be removed from office.\nWhile Waters has repeatedly stated her intention to \"get\" Trump and/or Pence, it has been in the context of Congress exercising its power to impeach a president and not, as the viral post suggests, to advocate violence.\u00a0\nWe rate the statement Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17372"}
