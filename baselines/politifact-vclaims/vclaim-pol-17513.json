The United States produced about 14% of the emissions, the European Union produced about 9%, and India 7%. The vast majority of countries produced less than 1%.\nIf we examine the same countries by per capita emissions, then China\u2019s production share drops to about 8%.\nRELATED FACT-CHECK: Does China burn seven to eight times as much coal as the U.S.?\nThe Facebook post shows Greta Thunberg, the Swedish teenager and climate change activist, stating \"why are we not going to China?\" It then shows billionaire George Soros saying \"shut up and stick to the script!\" We found no evidence that either made those statements.\u00a0\nThunberg and Soros have been used in multiple false posts. We debunked this one that said Thunberg posed with Soros and ISIS.\nAFP Fact-Check rated the same claim about China and found it false.\nWe found no evidence that China produces 90% of the world\u2019s carbon emissions.
