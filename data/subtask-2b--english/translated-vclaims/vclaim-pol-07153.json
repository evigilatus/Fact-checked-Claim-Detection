Christ and the Democrats have repeatedly attacked Scott for a fraud fine of $1.7 billion for medical care against Colombia/Canadian Health Agency, a health care company headed by Scott before he stepped down in 1997 in the middle of the federal investigation. Scott and the Republicans attacked Christ because of his friendship with a former campaign donor, Fort Lauderdale, attorney Scott Rothstein. Christ wasn't involved in the Ponzi scheme. According to the Narrator, a new FPR television announcement reminds voters of the call of Christ Prothstein and then submits this allegation: \"Now Christ is involved in a fraud case to channel taxpayers' money to the de facto Ponzi scheme.\" The screen text then states: \"The Florida lawsuit is called Digital Dammain's de facto Ponzi scheme,\" citing the July 2014 article in the newspaper South Florida Business Journal. The digital domain is a private company for impact movies that took $20 million of state money under what it was at the time. Krest, before he went bankrupt in 2012. The State has instituted a lawsuit called the \"de facto Ponzi scheme,\" but the announcement ignores the crucial context of the lawsuit: it was recently filed by counsel William Sherr, a pro-Scott and a repeated donor of WDP candidates. Christ's campaign lawyer, Mark Hiron, sent a letter to television stations calling the ad \"fake\" and urging them not to broadcast it. We decided to verify Christ's role in the digital domain deal and whether he was \"involved in a fraud case to channel taxpayers' money to the de facto Ponzi scheme.\" The digital lawsuit on the digital domain in California, created by director James Cameron, Despite its creative success, the company suffers from debt problems. * (For a thorough analysis of the failure of the digital domain, read this investigation in Palm Patch Post.) The Florida Digital Space was formed in 2009 with the hope of getting money here to settle debts from California. However, this strategy was not known to State officials at the time. After Enterprise Florida refused to apply for the digital domain for $20 million, the company sought another way. Kevin Amberer, R. Tampa, made an adjustment to the budget that included $20 million. Christ signed the budget in June 2009. However, in September 2012, Port St. Lucy announced that it would close its operations in Florida and applied for bankruptcy and the demobilization of more than 300 employees. The State hired Schererer to pursue the digital field, and Scherer filed his case in the 19th District of Port St. Lucy on July 22, 2014. The case is called digital domain managers and joint entities with the company as co-accused, as well as Amberer, who obtained a position on the digital domain board in 2011 after leaving the legislature. Amber's son also got a job at the company. The case does not name Christ as a defendant. However, Schererer &apos; s lawsuit repeatedly refers to Christ &apos; s finger and describes him as a key politician responsible for the termination of the mandate from the transaction. In fact, the case mentions Christ by name 35 times. The case filmed by Christ was deposited by digital domain managers starting years before the company got the state's money. The Scherer account for Christ began in 2007 when Sean Heineger, a digital businessman, invited Christ to a party to pressure Christ to give the company state money. The ex-wife of Heineger, Kelly Heineger, was dating Christ at the time. The lawsuit says that Christ went to California to check the project. On January 9, 2021, on Twitter, Sarah Goodlowski stated: \"Not all women lost jobs (in December's job report), most of them black and Latin women. In fact, white women got a job. On January 15, 2021, Nosiapa Mezan, a different picture appears in the report of the State Inspector General, which Scott ordered after the company collapsed. According to that report, government officials had not violated any laws or rules, although it generally raised concerns about the process of companies obtaining incentive funds from the State. The report shows how many politicians and State officials - not just Christ - played a role in the area of digital technology leaving with $20 million. He portrays Christ as making sure that legislative leaders participate by sending a letter to the President of the Senate, Jeff Atwater, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Larry Krittol, requesting them to be notified of the funding before it is approved. (The report also states that the lack of conflicting documentation and information impedes the Inspector General's ability to make a full decision.) Christ did not respond to a letter from the investigators (in English). So Christ played an important role in the company getting state money -- but he wasn't the only political player that made it happen. The Miami Herald/Tampa Bay Times wrote that the report showed that \"many legislative players agreed to a deal that cost taxpayers a high price later.\" These included Christ, Ambler, the Director of Economic Development of Christ del Brill, and the brokers of the legislature, including then the Republic, David Rivera, who chaired the State &apos; s Legislative Budget Committee, where the project was discussed before receiving the State &apos; s funds. Christ told the Palm Beach Post in 2013 that he had approved a $20 million grant because he believed that digital space was a promising opportunity for the State. \"I've really been supportive of trying to develop the film industry,\" said Christ. Was the \"Ponzi Plan\" de facto? In the lawsuit, Scherer wrote, \"Digital Domin California was a de facto Ponzi scheme. He was a serial borrower replacing the old debt with a new debt to keep the project going.\" The digital domain is now faced with allegations of fraud in a civil suit, but was it \"the de facto Ponzi scheme,\" as the Declaration suggests? We met Andrew Levy, a former federal prosecutor who prosecuted the Ponzi conspirators in South Florida and is now in private practice. \"It's definitely not a classic Bonzi scheme,\" said Levi. \"It's more than a debt scheme.\" In the traditional Ponzi scheme, businesses - which may or may not include a legitimate practice - seek funds from investors who promise high returns. When the business is unable to produce the proceeds, it seeks funds from a second group of investors to pay the value of the first group. The scheme eventually collapses when it cannot continue to pay investors &apos; dues. According to the Sherrer lawsuit, the California Digital Space was launched in Florida with the aim of seeking money and covering their debts from the California Corporation. \"This does not mean that it is not a fraud of some kind if the allegations are true, but it is not appropriate to the common classical definition of the Ponzi scheme,\" Livvie said. \"It's really hard to apply the term \"bonzi scheme.\" Christ's campaign spokesman, Brendan Gilvillen, has described the digital domain as \"commercial failure, not crime, and Rick Scott's administration has said itself about Jove. Christ didn't do anything wrong. It is not only Christ in the distribution of State funds for jobs that have not been realized. An investigation in Miami Herald/Tampa Bay Times found that the state gave Scott $266 million in tax exemptions and other incentives for 45,258 new jobs, but only 5% of jobs were realized. The Republicans' Declaration stated: \"Jesus is involved in a case of fraud to channel taxpayers' money into the de facto Ponzi scheme,\" pointing out that the digital domain receives $20 million in incentives to the state and then falls back. However, the state report, ordered by Scott, concluded that there were no violations of the law or rules by Christ or any other politician. The report also showed that Christ was one of many political players who helped the company obtain State funds. A civil court can find that the digital sphere has committed fraud. However, the company &apos; s plan to repay its debts in another country by obtaining funds from Florida is not in line with the definition of the classical Ponzi scheme. Also, while Christ is in the court file, he's not a defendant in the case. We value this allegation wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07153"}
