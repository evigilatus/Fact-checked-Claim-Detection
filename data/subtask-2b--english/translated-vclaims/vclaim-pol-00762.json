This is the second highest number of cases reported in the United States since the eradication of the infectious virus from the country in 2000, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, the Facebook article of the same day casts doubt on the risk of measles in comparison with the vaccine that the CDC recommends vaccination of all children against measles, mumps and rubella, commonly referred to as MMR vaccine. The article says, \"Pharmacies kill 11 people in 19 years (since 2000).\" \"MMR vaccine kills 445 infants in one year (since 2018). Why aren't you afraid of the vaccine?\" This article was referred to as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The article contains a link to a blog called \"Mother Street Journal.\" But the article in the blog -- \"Physicians disagree with the charges against Dr. Bob Sears, confirming the safety of vaccines is a concern\" -- is from 2016, two years before the earliest baseline mentioned in an article in Facebook. Nor do they mention measles. We asked Daniel Salmon, Director of the Vaccine Safety Institute at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, about the Facebook article. He said, \"That's not true.\" First, let us consider measles deaths. Since 2017, approximately 110,000 people worldwide have died of measles, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Before the introduction of the measles vaccine in 1963, epidemics were widespread every two to three years or so, and an estimated 2.6 million people died annually. Because Facebook publishes claim that measles has killed 11 people since 2000, which is a small part of the number of people who have died of measles worldwide, we will focus on verifying the facts about the United States. Benjamin Heinz, spokesman for the Communicable Disease Information Group of the Centre for Disease Control, said that three people had died of measles since 2000. Two people died in 2003, Heinz said, and another died in 2015. And then, let's look at Facebook's claim that the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine killed 445 children in one year, \"since 2018.\" Hynes said that the CDC did not have accurate data on maternal mortality. \"DCDCC and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) monitor reports of harmful events and post-immunization deaths using several different systems, including VAERS,\" Heinz said. \"As VAERS data cannot determine causation, we cannot use them to provide numbers of serious injuries or deaths caused by vaccination.\" Facebook was published on January 11, 2021 in Facebook, Nancy Belusi, who was no longer President of the House of Representatives by Samantha Buterman on January 12, 2021, but added: \"A large body of evidence supports vaccine safety, multiple studies and scientific reviews found no connection between vaccination and death except in rare cases.\" As we noted in verifying the facts of a website in 2015, the data was misused to claim that the measles vaccine had killed 108 people in the past decade, anyone could report to the Association, including doctors, patients, family members and friends. They can keep it regardless of whether they are sure of the death or of another event caused by the vaccine. However, we asked whether 445 infants were reported to have died in 2018 after receiving vaccinations against maternal diseases. We searched the VAERS vaccine and death database in 2018. Three cases of MMR vaccine were returned to the database and the patient died on or after 1 January 2018. The first case details the death of a 14-month-old boy. He was found dead in bed a week after his vaccination, according to the writing of the report. The cause of death was unknown. The second case details the death of a one-year-old girl. The anonymous reporter said that the vaccine caused the girl to lose her speech and appetite and to have seizures. \"When internal audit,\" the database says, \"the seizure is determined to be of medical importance.\" The cause of death was unknown. The third case details the death of a one-year-old boy. The cause of death was a seizure disorder. :: During the measles outbreak in 2014-15, unsubstantiated allegations of MMR vaccine deaths began to circulate online, according to a paper released in 2015 in a vaccine magazine entitled \"Death after vaccination: what evidence shows?\" The authors have summarized epidemiological data on post-immunization deaths, including cases where there is reasonable scientific evidence to support or contribute to the vaccination that caused the death. Their conclusion? Millions of vaccines are provided to children and adults in the United States every year, and serious negative responses from vaccines are not common. The newspaper says, \"Death from vaccines is very rare.\" \"A review of VAERS data reveals that many MMR mortality reports included children suffering from pre-existing or likely non-immunisation-related serious medical conditions,\" the paper continues. \"It is not about patterns that have emerged that would indicate a causal relationship with MMR vaccine and death.\" We looked for news coverage of 445 babies dying from MMR vaccine in one year. Such an event would attract the attention of the media. But we couldn't find any articles on the Internet, and when we searched Nixes' database for stories from 1 January 2018 to 11 April 2019, about 445 deaths from measles vaccines, we couldn't find anything to confirm Facebook's claim. We found an undated post on the website of the National Centre for Vaccine Information, a non-profit centre that describes itself as \"an independent clearing house for disease and vaccine science,\" but which was criticized as a vaccine control group promoting alternatives to vaccines, such as hand washing. In November 2018, according to the post, there were 459 deaths related to measles vaccines reported to VAERS. This is close to the 445, so we've rediscovered the federal database. It is true that 459 deaths have been reported to date, but include deaths reported since 1989. Some other warnings: First, 459 infant deaths were not reported. This figure covers all ages. According to the database, 272 deaths of children under the age of three were reported. Second, the research also covers reported deaths in respect of four other vaccines, not only the maternal mortality rate. Third, anyone can report to the Assembly even if they are not sure that the cause of death is the vaccine. The Facebook information is wrong. We value it pants on fire! Correction: The measles vaccine was introduced in 1963. Previously, this story said it was presented in 1993.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00762"}
