Ted Cruz of Texas portrays Democratic nominee Beto O\u2019Rourke, who represents El Paso in the U.S. House, as careless about border security.\nA TV ad from the Texans Are PAC that we spotted on Austin\u2019s Fox 7 Sept. 12, 2018, associates O\u2019Rourke, who opposes the border-long wall sought by Republicans led by President Donald Trump, with taxpayer-funded benefits for immigrants and \"sanctuary cities,\" a term that usually refers to communities that deter local law officers from asking individuals to share their immigration status.\nThe ad\u2019s narrator follows up the mention of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s support for sanctuary cities by saying, about O\u2019Rourke, \"while voting against border armor for Texas sheriffs patrolling the border.\" The ad also shows these words on screen: \"No body armor for Texas sheriffs.\"\nA 2014 House vote\nFine print below the ad\u2019s mention of sheriffs and body armor helped us start our factual review.

In that House-posted vote, O\u2019Rourke was among 62 members (counting 43 Democrats) to vote for the amendment from then-Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Florida, which was rejected by 355 members (including 145 Democrats).\nCruz\u2019s release said \"O\u2019Rourke voted in favor of a bill that would prevent funding for the Defense Department\u2019s Excess Personal Property Program.\" The release said the program had provided law enforcement in the El Paso area with more than $9 million in equipment, including 156 units of body armor for the sheriff\u2019s office; 90 night vision units for the local border patrol; helicopters for the city police and border patrol; and other items such as trauma gear, fencing and generators.\nAccording to the Defense Logistics Agency, which oversees the program, more than 8,000 federal and state law enforcement agencies participate. \"Law enforcement agencies use the equipment in a variety of ways,\" the agency says. \"For instance, four-wheel drive vehicles are used to interrupt drug harvesting, haul away marijuana, patrol streets and conduct surveillance. \u00a0The 1033 Program also helps with the agencies\u2019 general equipment needs, such as file cabinets, copiers and fax machines that they need but perhaps are unable to afford.\"\nOur web search for more information about the roll-call vote cited in the Texans Are ad led us to the text of Grayson\u2019s failed amendment to the Defense Department\u2019s appropriations act. That text forbade expenditures toward aircraft, tanks and weaponry provided from the personal property program to local law enforcement--but it made no mention of body armor.\nLet\u2019s get specific: Grayson\u2019s amendment said that no funds made available by the act \"may be used to transfer aircraft (including unmanned aerial vehicles), armored vehicles, grenade launchers, silencers, toxicological agents (including chemical agents, biological agents, and associated equipment), launch vehicles, guided missiles, ballistic missiles, rockets, torpedoes, bombs, mines, or nuclear weapons (as identified for demilitarization purposes outlined in Department of Defense Manual 4160.28) through the\" personal property program.\nVia the C-SPAN video archive, we watched Grayson present his proposal, which he said would restrict the Defense Department from militarizing community police agencies. Military weapons, he said, \"have no place in our streets regardless of who may be deploying them.\" \u00a0Two Republican members spoke in opposition before Grayson\u2019s proposal was rejected. \"We welcome this equipment; it\u2019s not misused,\" Rep. Rodney Frelilnghuysen, R-N.J., said.\nTexans Are leader notes another House vote\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter we\u2019d scoured the cited amendment, Jason Johnson, who runs the PAC, told us by email that the proposed restriction indeed extended to denying body armor to border sheriffs. He didn\u2019t say how.\nAfter we published this fact-check, we learned from the DLA that it stopped providing body armor to local jurisdictions years before the O'Rourke vote on Grayson's amendment. Spokeswoman Michelle McCaskill advised by email that the program \"stopped providing body armor in 2008. \u00a0When DLA Disposition Services receives excess body armor from the military services, it is destroyed. What we do provide,\" McCaskill wrote, \"are tactical vests but without the body armor inserted in them. Law enforcement can purchase body armor with their own funds or with federal grant money.\"\nEarlier, Johnson also told us that in June 2014, O\u2019Rourke voted against an amendment to the 2016 Defense Authorization Act successfully offered by Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Austin, \"that included border security activities on the list of preferred applications the Defense Department should consider when transferring excess property to other federal agencies.\"\nWe turned to the Congressional Record transcript of that debate to learn that for the purposes of border security, McCaul\u2019s amendment placed the Department of Homeland Security on equal footing with other law-enforcement agencies in access to Defense Department excess equipment.\nThe transcript shows that neither the amendment nor House floor debate touched on body armor for border sheriffs.\nO\u2019Rourke spoke in opposition to McCaul's amendment, it further shows, by saying DHS already had access to such equipment which, he said,\u00a0wasn\u2019t needed on the border anyway. O\u2019Rourke said we \"do not need to militarize the border\" and he said the amendment creates \"further anxiety and fear about the border at a time that is not warranted,\" according to the transcript.\nThe transcript shows O\u2019Rourke ultimately requested a record (rather than voice) vote on the amendment. In that roll call vote, O\u2019Rourke was among 162 Democrats and four Republicans voting \"no\" while McCaul was among 235 Republicans plus 18 Democrats voting \"aye.\"\nOur ruling\nTexans Are said O\u2019Rourke voted against providing body armor to Texas sheriffs patrolling the border.\nIn 2014, O\u2019Rourke voted in favor of barring the Defense Department from providing excess aircraft, tanks and military weaponry to local law agencies in general. However, the proposed restriction did not extend to body armor and made no mention of border sheriffs. Contrary to the ad's claim, there was no up-or-down vote on providing body armor to Texas sheriffs patrolling the border.\nWe rate this claim False.\n\nFALSE \u2013 The statement is not accurate.
