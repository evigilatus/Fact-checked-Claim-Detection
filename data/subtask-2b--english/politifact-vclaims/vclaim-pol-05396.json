In the spot, Cobb faces the camera and says: \"You trusted me to take on Tom DeLay \u2014 and we won.\" By email, Jeff Crosby, an adviser to candidate Margaret Moore, noted that while a local jury found DeLay guilty, his convictions were thrown out on appeal.\nWe asked Katie Naranjo, a consultant to Cobb\u2019s campaign, about Cobb\u2019s victory statement.\nBy email, Naranjo told us Cobb \"was entrusted as lead trial lawyer\" in DeLay\u2019s trial \"and Gary (and his trial team, other attorneys, investigators and support staff\u2014that is, \u2018we\u2019) won the trial.\"\nNaranjo acknowledged the convictions were overturned. Still, she wrote, \"Gary was not the appellate lawyer, which was another team. Trial lawyers often win a trial, and then that result might get overturned on appeal. That doesn\u2019t mean that the trial lawyers didn\u2019t win the trial.\"\nNews accounts\nLet\u2019s revisit the DeLay turning points as depicted in Statesman news stories, starting with the trial.\nIn November 2010, eight years after the county launched its investigation, a jury found DeLay, then 63, guilty of laundering corporate money into political donations during the 2002 elections. His indictment on the charges earlier led him to give up the leadership post; next, he left the House.\nFrom the Statesman account of the verdict:\nDeLay, a Republican whose nickname was \"The Hammer\" because of his heavy-handed leadership style, was accused of conspiring to funnel $190,000 of corporate money through the Republican National Committee, which sent $190,000 in campaign donations to seven GOP candidates for the Texas House.\nProsecutors argued that DeLay conspired to launder corporate money into political donations as the first step in creating a GOP majority in the Texas House. It later redrew the state's congressional districts to favor Republicans, which prosecutors said bolstered DeLay's hold on his leadership post in Washington.\nState law prohibits corporations from giving donations to candidates directly or indirectly. Prosecutors earlier said they thought the DeLay case is the first such criminal charge ever filed over the state's century-old law on corporate contributions in state political races.\nIn January 2011, DeLay was sentenced to three years in prison. But he also was released on a $10,000 bond pending appeals avowed by his lead trial lawyer, Dick DeGuerin.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in remarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCobb's role\nCobb appears to have led the county\u2019s courtroom team.\nA web search led us to a 2011 commentary by Rob Kepple of the Texas District & County Attorneys Association stating Cobb was part of a \"seasoned team\" of prosecutors in DeLay\u2019s trial including Beverly Mathews, Steven Brand and Holly Taylor.\nSeparately to our inquiry, the Travis County district attorney, Rosemary Lehmberg, said Cobb was the county\u2019s lead counsel in the trial. Lehmberg said: \"He was not as active in the appeals process,\" specifying that Taylor steered that task.\nAppeals courts\nOn Sept. 19, 2013, the state\u2019s 3rd Court of Appeals sided with DeLay and overturned the convictions won by Cobb.\nIn a 2-1 ruling that broke along party lines, the judges said the prosecution had failed to prove \"proceeds of criminal activity.\" It further noted that the jury on two occasions had asked trial Judge Pat Priest whether the $190,000 was \"illegal at the start of the transaction\" or \"procured by illegal means originally.\" And, the court said, prosecutors didn\u2019t prove that point \u2014 a critical element to conspiring to launder money \u2014 and the judge never answered the jurors\u2019 questions.\nMore than a year passed. But on Oct. 1, 2014, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, splitting 8-1 along party lines, upheld the lower court. DeLay\u2019s political committee could legally donate corporate money to the Republican National Committee and the national organization could legally make political donations to Texas candidates, the court found, and the agreement to swap money didn\u2019t constitute conspiracy -- and DeLay didn\u2019t \"knowingly\" violate the law.\nDistrict attorney comments\nAt the time, Lehmberg said in a written statement the court had effectively repealed the state law prohibiting corporate donations to candidates and placed an impossible burden on the state to prosecute violators of the ban. \"The decision undermines the fairness and integrity of our elections,\" she said.\nFor this fact check, we asked Lehmberg if Travis County \"won\" against DeLay. She credited Cobb with winning at trial. But, she said by phone, \"ultimately, we didn\u2019t\" prevail.\nOur ruling\nCobb says Travis County residents \"trusted me to take on Tom DeLay--and we won.\"\nCobb and the county won a jury verdict against DeLay. However, the convictions were tossed by an appeals court; its ruling was upheld by the state's highest criminal court of appeals.\nWe rate Cobb's claim Mostly False.\n\nMOSTLY FALSE \u2013 The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05396"}
