Mark Pocan hailed the move.\nBut Pocan, a Democrat from Madison, thinks a federal law is needed -- one that covers all workers.\n\"Only 21 states have made it illegal to fire or harass someone based on sexual orientation, or to deny a raise or refuse to hire on that same basis,\" Pocan wrote in a June 16, 2014 press statement.\nHe added: \"Wisconsin has been a leader on this issue, becoming the first state to ban public and private sector employment discrimination based on sexual orientation in 1982.\"\nIn the wake of a decision \u00a0by U.S. District Court Judge Barbara Crabb declaring Wisconsin\u2019s ban on same-sex marriage unconstitutional, we\u2019ve seen that claim about the state\u2019s pioneering role pop up a lot recently.\nWe wondered whether a state that voted in 2006 to ban gay marriages was the first to outlaw job discrimination against gays and lesbians.\nA look at the history\nWisconsin has a history of \"firsts\" on fair employment and worker protection laws dating to early in the 20th century.\nThe state was first on injured worker\u2019s compensation (1911), outlawing legal discrimination against women (1919), unemployment compensation (1932), and protections for handicapped persons (1965), according to the Wisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau.\nMany cities in the 1970s and early \u201880s, including Milwaukee, enacted local bans on workplace discrimination against gay people at the municipal level.\nIn 1975, Pennsylvania Gov. Milton Shapp, a Democrat, issued the first statewide executive order banning discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. It applied only to state employees.\nIn Wisconsin, Rep. David Clarenbach, a young Democrat from Madison, had spent several years pushing what even gay-rights advocates called a too-radical bill to legalize same-sex marriage, legalize prostitution, lower the age of consent to 14 and legalize consensual sex among unmarried adults.\nIt went nowhere.\nThen in 1981, Clarenbach introduced an anti-discrimination measure. Unlike the municipal laws and the Pennsylvania statute, it applied to the private sector as well as public workers statewide.\nClarenbach framed it as fairness and human rights issue, as recounted in William B. Turner\u2019s \u00a0\"The Gay Rights State: Wisconsin\u2019s Pioneering Legislation to Prohibit Discrimination Based on Sexual Orientation.\"\n\"The point is not whether homosexuality is admirable, but whether discrimination is tolerable,\" Clarenbach said during the debate.\nThe bill squeaked through the Assembly by four votes in 1981; Democrats dominated the majority, though it was Republican votes that helped put it over the top. Critics said it could lead to affirmative action advantages for lesbians and gay men.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Godlewski\n\n\nstated on January 9, 2021 in Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all women that lost jobs (in the December jobs report), it was mostly Black and Latina women. In fact, white women gained employment.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Nusaiba Mizan \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepublican Gov. Lee Dreyfus and others insisted on language banning such affirmative action, and the bill cleared the Senate in early 1982. Many mainstream religious denominations backed the overall bill, Dreyfus noted at the time.\nFundamentalist Christian radio listeners mounted a campaign to pressure Dreyfus into a veto, but the governor signed what was termed Chapter 112 into law on Feb. 25, 1982.\n\"I have decided to sign this bill for one basic reason, to protect one's right to privacy,\" Dreyfus said in his signing statement. \u00a0\"As one who believes in the fundamental Republican principle that government should have a very restricted involvement in people's private and personal lives, I feel strongly about governmentally sanctioned inquiry into an individual's thoughts, beliefs and feelings.\"\nHe added: \"Discrimination on sexual preference, if allowed, clearly must allow inquiries into one's private life that go beyond reasonable inquiry and in fact invade one's privacy.\"\nRepublican Tommy Thompson, who later served as governor, was minority \u00a0leader in the state Assembly during the 1982 debate.\nClarenbach later remarked that Thompson opposed the anti-discrimination bill but nonetheless kept it alive by declining to smother it in amendments, according to Turner.\nStates followed suit\nThe result was a law that banned discrimination against gays not only in employment but housing and public accommodations as well.\nWisconsin was first, and it would be seven years before Massachusetts followed suit.\nToday, 21 states have such employment measures, according to the American Civil Liberties Union and other sources. Most were enacted from 1991 to 2002.\nThose states are clustered in three regions: West (Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico); the upper Midwest (Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa and Illinois); and East ( Vermont, New Hampshire, New York, Maine, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland). Hawaii is the other.\nOf the states on the list, Wisconsin is one of three that does not cover gender identity in its law.\nThat leaves transgender people out of the law, something Pocan and Wisconsin Senator Tammy Baldwin hope to remedy through the proposed Employer Non-Discrimination Act.\nPocan, who is gay, won the congressional seat formerly held by Baldwin, who became the Senate\u2019s first openly gay member in 2012.\nThat bill would make discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender illegal in all 50 states. It passed the U.S. Senate in November 2013 on a 64-32 vote but has not cleared the Republican-controlled House.\nOur rating\nPocan claimed Wisconsin was the \"first state to ban public and private sector employment discrimination based on sexual orientation.\"\nThe history books say he is correct. While some municipalities did so earlier, and Pennsylvania did so for public workers only, Wisconsin\u2019s 1982 law was statewide and \u00a0covered all employees.\nWe rate Pocan\u2019s claim True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07709"}
