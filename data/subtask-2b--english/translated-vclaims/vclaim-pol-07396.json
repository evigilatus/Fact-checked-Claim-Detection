Michelle Nan came out of the light, a citizen of Georgia who had a good resume, a political lineage and a desire to be the next senator of the United States. In a new television commercial, N, a democracy, he criticizes the business tactics of the millionaire David Birdo, her Republican opponent in the race. The television advertising begins with the presentation of N as \"the head of the world's largest volunteer organization.\" This line gave a stop to the reader of Politi Fact, who called us to say that he was very confident that the International Red Cross, not the points of light, was holding this distinction. We honestly had no idea, but we promised to investigate. First, little about the very different work done by the non-profits. The Red Cross, the world &apos; s largest humanitarian organization, is best known for encouraging blood donation and its presence in theatre when disasters affect food, clothing and temporary housing assistance. :: The children of President Bush &apos; s mind are mobilizing volunteers through a network of 250 volunteer duty stations around the world, through their youth and national service graduates programmes and through their partnerships with thousands of non-profit companies. Nan, daughter of the former U.S. Sin Sam Nan, has been her CEO since 2007, when she merged with Hands on the Net, a non-profit organization that helped create it and ran. She is on leave from the flashlights during the election campaign. On its web site, Light Point states that it had 4 million volunteers worldwide in 2012. In contrast, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies offers a worldwide voluntary force of about 17 million people, of whom 501,208 are in North America. (We obtained those data through the collection of country data that we found on his website.) Pinwa Macha Carpentier, spokesperson for the organization in Geneva, Switzerland, confirmed the accuracy of our calculations. He gave a presentation to the Red Cross on the point of strength, showing that the organization had 17.1 million volunteers worldwide in 2012. Roy Barnes mentioned on May 21, 2010 in an advertising campaign when Roy Barnes was governor, \"Georgia created 235,000 jobs.\" So how can light spots be called \"the world's largest volunteer organization?\" The highlights routinely provide a more precise description of its work, although the campaign referred to at least two cases - one in 2007 and one in 2012 - where non-profit organizations referred to themselves as \"the world's largest voluntary organization.\" At present, on its website and elsewhere, the highlights are known as \"the world's largest organization devoted to volunteer service.\" It is a title that the group trusts can claim. \"We are unaware of any other organization dedicated solely to volunteer service that uses this wide range of assets to increase the number of volunteers in the world and the impact of their work,\" said Stephanie Weiss, the White spokesman in the e-mail. \"We say that \"light spots\" are the largest organization in the world devoted to volunteer service.\" We work with millions of people and tens of thousands of partner organizations to increase the number of volunteers in the world and the impact of their work.\" Tom Pollack, Senior Research Assistant at the Urban Institute Centre for Charities and Non-Profit Organizations, described the announcement as a point of light \"Don't hit me as being clearly deceiving or deceiving.\" He said, however, that describing itself as \"the world's largest organization devoted to volunteer service\" seemed more precise and \"a little less subject\" than to be misunderstood. Pollack said that data on volunteerism should be viewed with some doubt. This is because some people can participate in long-term volunteering. Others may participate in one event, such as the weekend, which helps build a home for a needy family, and the organization may not be keen to track the number of participants. On the basis of the data reported by non-profit organizations in their federal tax forms, Pollack has been able to provide us with a list of 25 non-profit organizations that have reported the largest number of volunteers at the national level. No. The first is the American Heart Association, which has 22 million volunteers, followed by the Dystation Inc, which has 15 million volunteers. Pollack said he was not aware of the information available to make a similar comparison on a global scale. The 17.1 million Red Cross volunteers do not appear to be a record based solely on figures used by American organizations. So where does that leave us? The points of light have a unique mission that President Bush carved - mobilizing volunteers around the world. Nan used her leadership for profit to burn her leadership qualifications in the race against businessman Birdo. But her political declaration weakens how light spots describe themselves on her website -- as the world's largest organization dedicated to volunteer service. This is significantly different from the world &apos; s largest voluntary organization. We're assessing the advertising statement as mostly wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07396"}
