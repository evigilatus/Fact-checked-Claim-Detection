As one of the executives of industry has said, this industry is regulated by the laws of mobile telephones in the age of smartphones. This is why the Telecommunications Restriction Bill has accelerated through the two chambers of the legislature with relatively little opposition. This measure is the first major revision of the State Telecommunications Act since 1994 and would, inter alia, repeal regulations that force telephone companies to invest in old-fashioned land lines. One of the hypotheses of the bill - approved by the margins of the two broad parties in the Senate and Assembly on 11 May 2011 - is that if telephone companies no longer have to spend money on old technology, they will instead inject resources into the broadband of the high-speed Internet service. This will lead to economic growth. How much growth? According to a study cited by the State of Sin. Rich Zepper, R-Pewaukee, one of the main sponsors of this measure, the new law may create 50,000 jobs. The claim was submitted in interviews with the Journal Sentinel on 26 and 4 May and in a certificate on the draft law. Others, including senior telecommunications executives, used the figure in public hearings, one of whom said that it could mean $2.6 billion in new investments in the state. The job numbers appeared in a report from the Discovery Institute, commissioned by Werid Wisconsin, a broad-band group, and the Wisconsin Technology Council, a non-profit and non-partisan group that advises the Governor and the legislature and promotes communication and economic development. The Discovery Institute is a conservative think tank in Seattle known as the promotion of \"smart design.\" 50,000 jobs? It sounds like no mind. And a big first push on Jove. The goal of Scott Walker is to create 250,000 jobs in the next four years. But what is the basis of these numbers? When we dug into the data track (and news bulletins), what we found was like an old game of phone, where something repeated over and over and then changed in small ways to fit political arguments. First, let us be clear: the functions alleged are not directly related to telephone service or to persons working for the telephone company. One expert, Barry Orton, a telecommunications professor between the University of Wisconsin and Madison, believes that deregulation can lead to job cuts because telephone companies will need fewer workers to deal with land lines. Instead, declared jobs and economic prosperity will come from more people who use the Internet very quickly, which should improve efficiency, among other things. This figure of 50,000 stems from the WinkKentucky project in that state between 2005 and 2007. The project included increased broadband publicity and, in some cases, free computers for people. The main result was that 7 per cent of people registered in broadband service. The survey estimated consumer savings in terms of time, miles and health care, and calculated the impact on job creation and retention through broadband. Kentucky was transformed into a national project called \"The Connected Nation.\" This group took Kentucky's results -- a 7% increase -- and developed the economic impact of broadband adoption for each state and for the country as a whole. For Wisconsin, the connected nation states that increased broadband use would lead to \"a direct annual income growth of $1.8 billion,\" and 50,748 jobs created or provided, with a total economic impact of $2.6 billion. These figures assume that broadband service is widely available and attracts participants in the same way as it was in Kentucky five or seven years ago. The Kentucky and Connecticut national groups have criticized their relations with the telecommunications industry. \"Concate Kentucky is no more than a sales power and a front group of AT&T paid for by the telecommunications industry, state governments and federal governments that have achieved much more publicity than in actual delivery.\" In January 9, 2008, communications expert Art Brodsky wrote in a blog on the public knowledge website. Brian Miffford, Executive Director of the National Communication Programme, appealed that the Code was inaccurate, and that Bill South/At &apos; And &apos; s contributions constituted a small fraction of the revenues of the Kentucky network. In any event, the study did not specifically consider the situation in Wisconsin, including the current economic climate, and was carried out by a group with links to industry, which seeks to deregulate. Therefore, his findings are on shaky ground from the beginning. Further efforts have been made to assess how the expansion of broadband services will lead to economic growth. The Contact Group and others rely on a 2007 study by the Brookings Institution, a medium-to-emancipated think tank, which has developed a formula for measuring the economic impact of broadband expansion. \"One percentage point increase - about 3 million lines - is associated with about 300,000 other jobs, assuming that the economy has not actually achieved full employment (or the lowest rate of unemployment that can be achieved at a low and stable rate of inflation). It is clear that this projection is subject to a miscalculation and depends on some stagnation in the labour market.\" But those projections were from 2007 - before the worst recession began in over 70 years. However, another job criterion is found in a 2010 study by United States telecommunications workers, which does not provide any ratios for their figures, but appears to depend in part on the Brookings report. According to the Women's Affairs Commission study: \"Studies show that every additional investment of $5 billion in broadband creates 250,000 jobs - 100,000 jobs directly and indirectly from spending on communications and information technology equipment as well as 150,000 more jobs in \"network effects,\" stimulating new online applications and services. With each percentage point increase in broadband penetration, employment expands by approximately 300,000 jobs.\" That report didn't provide a Wisconsin number. When asked about the appreciation given by Zepper, he said that it was impossible to predict the number of jobs that would result from the deregulation of the ground telephone service. In an interview, he said, \"I don't know exactly how many jobs you're gonna create.\" He asked why the figure of 50,000 had been mentioned, and replied: \"Because it was the only one there. That's the number there from one organization.\" The CEO of Wisconsin said that telecommunications companies \"do not make direct promises\" about how much broadband services they would expand. He said the number of 50,000 jobs was \"discrimination.\" The Panel notes that Ohio and Illinois have removed regulation of their telephone companies and experienced growth in corporate investment through broadband extension services. Look at one report from a technical group in Ohio. The most recent item in the report related to job creation was in October: $57,400,000 from the first energy service company in Akron to modernize the smart network. Creation of 2,870 potential posts. * And the star leads to the CWA formula, in other words, it's an estimate that leads back to the Brookings formula. Clearly, high-speed Internet service helps people and businesses work more efficiently. In fact, TS Telecommunications, a telephone company that converts its focus to broadband, has invested $100 million in Wisconsin in the past three years and is advertising 60 jobs on the basis of future growth. However, the question is to use the figure that was often requested of 50,000. In his defence of deregulation, Zipper et al. cited this figure. It was generated on the basis of experience in another state more than five years ago. The methodology used there has been recycled in a variety of reports, papers and press releases that seek to increase the urgency of deregulation of telecommunications. Furthermore, the study relating to the telecommunications industry, which seeks to deregulate, is Even Zepper and other supporters admit that they do not know how many jobs the new law will create, or how much money will be invested by telecommunications companies. We're barely evaluating the statement. Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" By Haley Bimler: January 26, 2021 Editor's Note: This statement was estimated to be barely correct when it was published.
