Take a look at their settlement. California admitted to a million votes. They admitted to a million votes,\" Trump told Chuck Todd, the show\u2019s host, in an interview that aired June 23, 2019.\u00a0\nElection officials and fact checkers have previously called out Trump\u2019s baseless claims on the subject. In November 2016, PolitiFact National rated Pants on Fire his contention that he lost the popular vote because \"millions of people voted illegally.\" PolitiFact California handed out the same rating for his claim of \"serious voter fraud\" in California.\nHillary Clinton won the state by more than 4 million votes and she won the national popular vote by about 2.8 million. Trump won the decisive Electoral College tally.\u00a0\nWe wanted to know the veracity of Trump\u2019s new claim. So, we examined the settlement that he said is evidence of massive voter fraud in California.\nHere\u2019s the exchange between Trump and Chuck Todd:\u00a0\nTodd: \"You didn't like the fact that you lost the popular vote. That bothered you, didn't it?\"\nTrump: \"Well, I think it was a -- I mean, I'll say something that, again, is controversial. There were a lot of votes cast that I don't believe.

It requires Los Angeles County election officials to remove inactive registrations from voter rolls to comply with federal law.\u00a0\nThe 20-page settlement document, however, notes all parties agreed there was no admission of liability or wrongdoing by the state or county. It makes no mention of voter fraud or illegal voting.\u00a0\nIn a written statement, California Secretary of State Alex Padilla blasted Trump\u2019s new allegation. Padilla, a Democrat, has also been critical of the president\u2019s past statements on voter fraud.\u00a0\n\"No matter how much he repeats them, Trump's lies about voter fraud are patently untrue. Specifically, the settlement with Judicial Watch, Los Angeles County, and the Secretary of State contains absolutely no admission to or evidence of \"illegal votes.\" The President\u2019s claims are untrue and yet another distortion aimed at undermining confidence in our elections.\u00a0\nThe settlement was clear and simple, California will continue its work to adhere to modern list maintenance procedures under the National Voter Registration Act.\u00a0 California elections officials have and will continue to work to meet the goals of the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA): maintaining the accuracy of the voter rolls and increasing the number of eligible citizens who register and vote.\"\nDean Logan, Los Angeles County\u2019s top elections official, added in an email: \"The agreement is about voter registration record keeping and interpretation of federal law, not about votes cast in any election.\"\nIn a press release last week, Judicial Watch said Los Angeles County had \"sent notices to as many as 1.59 million inactive voters on its voter rolls \u2013 a step toward removing the names of voters who have moved, died, or are otherwise ineligible to vote.\" Logan, the county elections official, confirmed the notices had been sent.\u00a0\nTrump\u2019s claim \u2018completely inaccurate\u2019\nThe Associated Press reported on the agreement in January, describing it as a settlement on \"old voter records,\" not on illegal voting. In the article, Paul Mitchell of the nonpartisan research firm Political Data Inc. called the case insignificant because it involves inactive voters who \"are not getting voting materials, they are not casting ballots, they are not showing up in precincts.\"\n\"What they are saying is L.A. county holds on to too many inactive registrations,\" he told the AP. \"This whole thing does nothing to clean up the active voter file.\"\nReached for this fact check, Mitchell called Trump\u2019s claim \"completely inaccurate.\"\u00a0\nThe White House did not respond to a request for information supporting the president\u2019s claim. Judicial Watch also did not respond. The group\u2019s president, Tom Fitton, has described the settlement on Twitter and in the AP article as an effort to \"clean up\" the state\u2019s election rolls.\nOur ruling\nPresident Trump recently claimed California \"admitted\" there were \"a million\" illegal votes in the 2016 presidential election, in an effort to support his widely debunked claim of massive voter fraud in the state.\u00a0\nTrump cited a January settlement between the state and Judicial Watch.\u00a0\nBut that agreement says nothing about voter fraud or illegal voting. Instead, it requires Los Angeles County election officials to begin the process of removing inactive registrations, for people who have gone years without voting often because they\u2019ve moved or died, to comply with federal law.\u00a0\nIt says all parties agreed there was no admission of liability or wrongdoing by the state or county.\nState and county elections officials strongly rejected the president's statement.\nWe found Trump's new voter fraud claim as baseless as his past allegations.\nWe rate\u00a0it Pants on Fire.\u00a0\n\nPANTS ON FIRE\u00a0\u2013\u00a0The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.\n Share the Facts 2019-06-25 00:08:41 UTC   PolitiFact    1 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Pants on Fire  California \"admitted\" there were \"a million\" illegal votes in the 2016 presidential election.
