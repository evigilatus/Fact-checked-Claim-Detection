But there\u2019s been little discussion of the claim that America has an untapped domestic oil source that tops oil-rich Saudi Arabia by a factor of six.\n\nIs Hovde right?\n\nHovde\u2019s campaign pointed us to the Republican website for the House Natural Resources Committee, chaired by U.S. Rep. Doc Hastings (R-Washington).\n\n\"According to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) the U.S. holds more than half of the world\u2019s oil shale resources,\" the site says. \"The most recent estimates (April, 2009) show the region may hold more than 1.5 trillion barrels of oil \u2013 six times Saudi Arabia\u2019s proven resources, and enough to provide the United States with energy for the next 200 years.\"\n\nHovde, the committee website and the USGS are talking about the same thing -- the Green River Formation in Colorado, Utah and Wyoming. But each is using some critically different ways to describe it.\n\nThe Green River Formation is considered the world\u2019s largest oil shale resource, but only sporadic attempts have been made to explore it -- typically when oil prices spike.\n\nThe reason: It\u2019s not crude oil that lies beneath the surface, as in Saudi Arabia. It\u2019s oil shale, a solid organic compound that can be converted to oil only when heated to great temperatures. The USGS made clear when it announced its findings in 2009.\n\nHuge obstacles including costs, technology and environmental concerns have stood in the way.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the non-partisan source, the Geological Survey. Pressed by Congress during a gas-price spike several years ago, the survey analyzed the oil shale resource and determined the Colorado section of the formation by far the most promising.\n\nThey estimated that 1.525 trillion barrels of \"in-place oil shale resources\" lie in the Colorado section. That\u2019s the number Hovde and the Republican website mention.\n\nBut each shortens that to \"oil\" -- and that\u2019s a big difference.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Geological Survey describes oil shale as \"pre oil\" because it is not ready-made crude.\n\nAnd the agency\u2019s assessment made an important point: No economically viable extraction method is currently available in the United States, because the process is so technologically and environmentally challenging compared to conventional extraction of actual crude oil.\n\n\"Much of the resource in Colorado, where the richest deposits of high grade oil shale exist, are buried deep enough that mining is considered impractical or prohibitively difficult and expensive,\" said Justin Birdwell, a USGS research engineer studying the resource, in an interview. The focus, therefore has been on underground processing technologies, which are unproven.\n\nGiven this backdrop, the agency concluded in 2009 that it\u2019s unknown how much of that 1.5 trillion barrels is recoverable. That\u2019s still true today, although the agency is developing estimates. Recovery of oil is years or decades away, certainly not \"immediate\" as Hovde described it.\n\nAdditionally, when it comes to the Saudi Arabia comparison, Hovde runs into a major apples-to-oranges problem when he says the 1.5 trillion \"barrels of oil\" in the Green River Formation is \"six times more\" than in Saudi Arabia.\n\nHe is comparing Saudi Arabia\u2019s 266 billion of \"proved resources\" with the 1.5 trillion in the Green River Formation -- but the latter number is only an estimate of the total \"in-place\" in the formation, without regard to the ability to get it out or get a viable price for it.\n\nIt\u2019s a \"major distinction,\" as a Congressional Research Service paper on US fossil fuel resources noted in 2010.\n\n\"Proved reserves are those amounts of oil, natural gas, or coal that have been discovered and defined, typically by drilling wells or other exploratory measures, and which can be economically recovered,\" the study said.\n\nIn terms of proved reserves, the US has 20.7 billion barrels -- 13 times less than Saudi Arabia, according to the latest data from the Energy Information Administration, a US government agency.\n\nThe Republican website Hovde cites was more precise and cautious than the candidate. It said the region \"may hold\" more than 1.5 trillion barrels, and explicitly compared that to the Saudi\u2019s \"proven\" resources.\n\nHovde omitted the qualifiers.\n\nIn any case, according to two Congressional Research Service studies, oil shale \"makes poor feedstock for making gasoline, so it might primarily be a source of other liquid middle distillate fuels such as jet fuel or diesel oil, fuels for which there is significant national demand.\"\n\nFinally, Hovde\u2019s claim reminded us of a February 2012 item by PolitiFact National that rated Mostly False a claim by Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich. He said that by one estimate the United States \u00a0may have \"three times as much oil in the United States as there is in Saudi Arabia.\"\n\nThat item noted the same apples-to-oranges problem in the comparison.\n\nOur rating\n\nHovde suggested that we immediately tap into America\u2019s natural resources, which he said are \"more than 1.5 trillion barrels of oil (six times more than Saudi Arabia).\"\n\nHovde referred to a massive western United States formation of oil shale, and there\u2019s a kernel of truth in that government officials estimate that 1.5 trillion barrels are contained there.\n\nBut Hovde omits a critical fact: He\u2019s comparing that uncertain oil shale resource with Saudi oil reserves that have been discovered and defined and can be extracted economically. It\u2019s unknown what the western formation will yield, and it certainly won\u2019t come immediately.\n\nWe rate the claim Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10778"}
