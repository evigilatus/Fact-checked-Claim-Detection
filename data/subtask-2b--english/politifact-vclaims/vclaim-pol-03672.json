Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., had been planning to have a town hall with MSNBC\u2019s Chris Hayes and residents of McDowell County, W.Va., on Feb. 13, 2017, until the West Virginia National Guard told them they could not use a local armory for the event.\nSanders instead appeared on Hayes\u2019 show by satellite from the U.S. Capitol, still tailoring his comments to West Virginia.\nSanders: \"And one of the ironies, Chris, is that one of the states that has benefited the most from Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act, is West Virginia.\"\nHayes: \"Yes.\"\nSanders: \"Before the Affordable Care Act, their uninsured rate for people 64 to 19 was 29 percent. Today, it is 9 percent.\"\nIs that correct? Sanders\u2019 office pointed to one government number to support its point. Another government number we found showed a less dramatic decline, but it doesn't change the thrust of his overall point.\nLet\u2019s crunch the numbers.\nWe\u2019ll start by noting that the age range Sanders cited make some sense. The mandatory Medicare program kicks in at age 65, and enhanced access for children to government health programs tends to produce higher insurance coverage rates for kids than for adults.\nSanders\u2019 office pointed to an article in the Charleston (W.Va.) Gazette-Mail that touted the state had the country\u2019s \"biggest decline\" in the uninsured rate. The article points to data from the National Health Interview Survey, conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThe study found that between 2013 and 2015, West Virginia\u2019s uninsured rate for persons between 18 and 64 fell from 28.8 percent to 8.9 percent. That supports Sanders\u2019 point. (We won\u2019t quibble about Sanders citing an age range that was off by one year.)\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the same report provides an important caveat. It notes that for several states \u2014 including West Virginia \u2014 the data was \"not statistically significant due to larger standard errors.\"\nIt turns out that some states in the CDC study don\u2019t have enough people sampled to provide robust data. \"This would be especially important for a small, low-population state like West Virginia,\" said Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush and remains a health care policy analyst.. \u00a0\nSo is there a better number? Yes, specifically, data from the Current Population Survey\u2019s Annual Social and Economic Supplement. This data set, published by the U.S. Census Bureau, asks questions every year on a battery of topics, including health insurance coverage. The database includes figures broken down by state and age category.\nWe looked at West Virginia\u2019s figures for the uninsured population below 65 and subtracted the uninsured population below 18.\nHere\u2019s what we found.\n\nThis data backs up Sanders\u2019 most recent uninsured rate for West Virginia.\u00a0But instead of 29 percent, it shows the state\u2019s uninsured rate hovered around 21 percent between 2008 and 2013.\nWilensky said she\u2019s not surprised to see such a wide difference between the two data sets, given the methodological differences. She added that the decline in West Virginia\u2019s uninsured rate is still notable and was made possible by the Medicare expansion provision of the Affordable Care Act.\n\"West Virginia\u2019s level of uninsurance would be on the higher side to begin with since they are a poor state,\" she said. \"Since they took advantage of the Medicaid expansion, the big decline is not surprising.\"\nOur ruling\nSanders said, \"Before the Affordable Care Act, (West Virginia\u2019s) uninsured rate for people 64 to 19 was 29 percent. Today, it is 9 percent.\"\nSanders pointed to one federal measurement, though it has methodological problems when drilling down to the statistics for smaller states. A more reliable data set for West Virginia\u2019s case showed a decline from 21 percent to 9 percent. The decline\u00a0was not as dramatic as he\u2019d indicated, but it was still a significant one.\nWe rate the statement Mostly\u00a0True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/e77836ec-8c59-4d9a-835e-64204dc815d4", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03672"}
