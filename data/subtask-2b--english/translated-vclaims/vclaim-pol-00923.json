In the midst of talking about rented schools and scholarships and increasing teachers &apos; wages, one allegation in particular raised the level of our ears. \"Since 2011, the gap in secondary school graduation rates between African-American students and all students has been halved, from 6.4 per cent to 3.1 per cent,\" said Berger. The claim was so specific that we wanted to verify it ourselves. The figures show that they are accurate. The spokesman for Berger Pat Ryan said that statistics came from the Department of Public Education in North Carolina, which follows graduation rates and publishes them on the Internet. According to the department, the graduation rate for all graduate students in 2010-2011 was 77.9 per cent, and the rate for black students in that year was 71.5 per cent. This means that there is a gap of 6.4 percentage points between the ratio for all students and that for black students. The gap has been reduced by more than half since then and has become smaller each year between 2010-11 and 2016-17, when it reached 2.6 percentage points low. Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" \u2022 January 26, 2021, 2017-18, the graduation rate for all students was 86.3%, and the graduation rate for black students was 83.2%, making the gap just 3.1 percentage points. The language of a burger was not as precise as it could have been, and he pointed to the gap in percentage terms rather than percentage points. He also referred to graduation rates for Afro-Americans when actual statistics from the Ministry of Public Education related to black pupils. But the numbers are correct, and his main point is clear. For science, the graduation rates for white students were 82.6 in 2010-2011 and 89.6 in 2017-18, so the gap between black and white students was greater at both time points than the gap between black and students as a whole. \"Since 2011, the gap in secondary school graduation rates between African American students and all students has been halved, from 6.4 per cent to 3.1 per cent,\" said our Governor Berger. The most recent data from the Ministry of Public Education show these figures immediately. We're assessing this statement right.
