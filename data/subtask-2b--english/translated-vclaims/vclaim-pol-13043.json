With all the talk about the United States, which has recently reached a debt ceiling of $14.3 trillion, it is difficult to imagine an era when the Government actually reduced its borrowing burden in proportion to the national economy. We wondered if McDonnell was right. The Governor was talking about the United States debt as a percentage of the country &apos; s GDP, which is the value of all goods and services produced in the country. According to economists, this ratio is important because it measures the capacity of the State to support its debt. After World War II, did this percentage fall in the United States until the 1980s? Before we reach numbers, it is useful to point out that the national debt of the United States consists of two elements. The largest part is publicly owned debt owed to investors, the federal reserve, as well as state and local governments that have purchased United States securities. The second part is the debt held by government accounts, most of which are social security trust funds, medical care, military retirement and other programmes. We asked the Governor &apos; s office about the source of information regarding his statement. Jeff Caldwell, spokesman for the Governor, sent us a table of the Budget Office of Congress showing the level of publicly held debt as a percentage of GDP from 1790 to 2000. This figure shows a relatively steady decline from the post-Second World War peak to around 1980. In order to gain an idea of how the level of debt changed each year between the mid-40s and 1980s, we also examined the historical tables on the web site of the Office of Administrative and Budgetary Questions. Let us begin in 1946, the year after the end of the Second World War. At the end of that fiscal year, the total federal debt - total public and government debt - was 121.7 per cent of GDP, the highest level ever. This has seen a general decline over 35 years, although there were about dozens of times when the share of debt in GDP rose from year to year before falling again. In 1979, debt was 33.2 per cent of GDP. If you look only at public debt as a percentage of GDP, it follows the same path. The highest proportion of GDP was also in 1946, when it was 108.7 per cent of the State &apos; s economic output. This also declined gradually until 1979, when the debt pledged accounted for 25.6 per cent of GDP. So in both cases, debt is calculated -- total debt or public debt only -- McDonnell is true that as a share of GDP it declined for almost 35 years between the end of the 82nd World War. Total national debt as a percentage of GDP increased during the 1980s and declined in the late 1990s. However, since 2001, this phenomenon has been on the rise. The total debt is expected to reach 102.6 per cent at the end of fiscal year 2011, according to the Office of the Ombudsman. McDonnell warned that the total US debt was on its way to \"registration levels.\" As a percentage of GDP, total debt still has a way forward before reaching its record level of 121.7 per cent in 1946. If the national debt is measured only in dollars, most of it has been rising since the end of the Second World War. The total national debt was $270.1 billion in 1946. The current level of some $14.3 trillion as at 30 April 2011 has risen somewhat. Let's go over it. McDonnell said that since the end of the Second World War, national debt had declined as a percentage of GDP for almost 30 years until the 1980s. McDonnell is right that debt, when measured as a percentage of the country &apos; s GDP, was on a downward path during that period. We value his claim right.
