0001	TRUMP	Friends, delegates and fellow Americans I humbly and gratefully accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States.
0002	TRUMP	Story Continued Below Together, we will lead our party back to the White House, and we will lead our country back to safety, prosperity, and peace.
0003	TRUMP	We will be a country of generosity and warmth.
0004	TRUMP	But we will also be a country of law and order.
0005	TRUMP	Our Convention occurs at a moment of crisis for our nation.
0006	TRUMP	The attacks on our police, and the terrorism in our cities, threaten our very way of life.
0007	TRUMP	Any politician who does not grasp this danger is not fit to lead our country.
0008	TRUMP	Americans watching this address tonight have seen the recent images of violence in our streets and the chaos in our communities.
0009	TRUMP	Many have witnessed this violence personally, some have even been its victims.
0010	TRUMP	I have a message for all of you the crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon come to an end.
0011	TRUMP	Beginning on January 20th 2017, safety will be restored.
0012	TRUMP	The most basic duty of government is to defend the lives of its own citizens.
0013	TRUMP	Any government that fails to do so is a government unworthy to lead.
0014	TRUMP	It is finally time for a straightforward assessment of the state of our nation.
0015	TRUMP	I will present the facts plainly and honestly.
0016	TRUMP	We cannot afford to be so politically correct anymore.
0017	TRUMP	So if you want to hear the corporate spin, the carefullycrafted lies, and the media myths the Democrats are holding their convention next week.
0018	TRUMP	But here, at our convention, there will be no lies.
0019	TRUMP	We will honor the American people with the truth, and nothing else.
0020	TRUMP	Trump speech draft leaks hours in advance By NICK GASS These are the facts Decades of progress made in bringing down crime are now being reversed by this Administrations rollback of criminal enforcement.
0021	TRUMP	Homicides last year increased by 17% in Americas fifty largest cities.
0022	TRUMP	Thats the largest increase in 25 years.
0023	TRUMP	In our nations capital, killings have risen by 50 percent.
0024	TRUMP	They are up nearly 60% in nearby Baltimore.
0025	TRUMP	In the Presidents hometown of Chicago, more than 2,000 have been the victims of shootings this year alone.
0026	TRUMP	And more than 3,600 have been killed in the Chicago area since he took office.
0027	TRUMP	The number of police officers killed in the line of duty has risen by almost 50% compared to this point last year.
0028	TRUMP	Nearly 180,000 illegal immigrants with criminal records, ordered deported from our country, are tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens.
0029	TRUMP	The number of new illegal immigrant families who have crossed the border so far this year already exceeds the entire total from 2015.
0030	TRUMP	They are being released by the tens of thousands into our communities with no regard for the impact on public safety or resources.
0031	TRUMP	One such bordercrosser was released and made his way to Nebraska.
0032	TRUMP	There, he ended the life of an innocent young girl named Sarah Root.
0033	TRUMP	She was 21 yearsold, and was killed the day after graduating from college with a 4.0 Grade Point Average.
0034	TRUMP	Her killer was then released a second time, and he is now a fugitive from the law.
0035	TRUMP	Ive met Sarahs beautiful family.
0036	TRUMP	But to this Administration, their amazing daughter was just one more American life that wasnt worth protecting.
0037	TRUMP	One more child to sacrifice on the altar of open borders.
0038	TRUMP	What about our economy?
0039	TRUMP	Again, I will tell you the plain facts that have been edited out of your nightly news and your morning newspaper Nearly Four in 10 AfricanAmerican children are living in poverty, while 58% of African American youth are not employed.
0040	TRUMP	2 million more Latinos are in poverty today than when the President took his oath of office less than eight years ago.
0041	TRUMP	Another 14 million people have left the workforce entirely.
0042	TRUMP	Household incomes are down more than $4,000 since the year 2000.
0043	TRUMP	Our manufacturing trade deficit has reached an alltime high  nearly $800 billion in a single year.
0044	TRUMP	The budget is no better.
0045	TRUMP	President Obama has doubled our national debt to more than $19 trillion, and growing.
0046	TRUMP	Yet, what do we have to show for it?
0047	TRUMP	Our roads and bridges are falling apart, our airports are in Third World condition, and fortythree million Americans are on food stamps.
0048	TRUMP	Now let us consider the state of affairs abroad.
0049	TRUMP	Not only have our citizens endured domestic disaster, but they have lived through one international humiliation after another.
0050	TRUMP	We all remember the images of our sailors being forced to their knees by their Iranian captors at gunpoint.
0051	TRUMP	This was just prior to the signing of the Iran deal, which gave back to Iran $150 billion and gave us nothing  it will go down in history as one of the worst deals ever made.
0052	TRUMP	Another humiliation came when president Obama drew a red line in Syria  and the whole world knew it meant nothing.
0053	TRUMP	In Libya, our consulate  the symbol of American prestige around the globe  was brought down in flames.
0054	TRUMP	America is far less safe  and the world is far less stable  than when Obama made the decision to put Hillary Clinton in charge of Americas foreign policy.
0055	TRUMP	I am certain it is a decision he truly regrets.
0056	TRUMP	Her bad instincts and her bad judgment  something pointed out by Bernie Sanders  are what caused the disasters unfolding today.
0057	TRUMP	Lets review the record.
0058	TRUMP	In 2009, preHillary, ISIS was not even on the map.
0059	TRUMP	Libya was cooperating.
0060	TRUMP	Egypt was peaceful.
0061	TRUMP	Iraq was seeing a reduction in violence.
0062	TRUMP	Iran was being choked by sanctions.
0063	TRUMP	Syria was under control.
0064	TRUMP	After four years of Hillary Clinton, what do we have?
0065	TRUMP	ISIS has spread across the region, and the world.
0066	TRUMP	Libya is in ruins, and our Ambassador and his staff were left helpless to die at the hands of savage killers.
0067	TRUMP	Egypt was turned over to the radical Muslim brotherhood, forcing the military to retake control.
0068	TRUMP	Iraq is in chaos.
0069	TRUMP	Iran is on the path to nuclear weapons.
0070	TRUMP	Syria is engulfed in a civil war and a refugee crisis that now threatens the West.
0071	TRUMP	After fifteen years of wars in the Middle East, after trillions of dollars spent and thousands of lives lost, the situation is worse than it has ever been before.
0072	TRUMP	This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton death, destruction and weakness.
0073	TRUMP	But Hillary Clintons legacy does not have to be Americas legacy.
0074	TRUMP	The problems we face now  poverty and violence at home, war and destruction abroad  will last only as long as we continue relying on the same politicians who created them.
0075	TRUMP	A change in leadership is required to change these outcomes.
0076	TRUMP	Tonight, I will share with you my plan of action for America.
0077	TRUMP	The most important difference between our plan and that of our opponents, is that our plan will put America First.
0078	TRUMP	Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo.
0079	TRUMP	As long as we are led by politicians who will not put America First, then we can be assured that other nations will not treat America with respect.
0080	TRUMP	This will all change in 2017.
0081	TRUMP	The American People will come first once again.
0082	TRUMP	My plan will begin with safety at home  which means safe neighborhoods, secure borders, and protection from terrorism.
0083	TRUMP	There can be no prosperity without law and order.
0084	TRUMP	On the economy, I will outline reforms to add millions of new jobs and trillions in new wealth that can be used to rebuild America.
0085	TRUMP	A number of these reforms that I will outline tonight will be opposed by some of our nations most powerful special interests.
0086	TRUMP	That is because these interests have rigged our political and economic system for their exclusive benefit.
0087	TRUMP	Big business, elite media and major donors are lining up behind the campaign of my opponent because they know she will keep our rigged system in place.
0088	TRUMP	They are throwing money at her because they have total control over everything she does.
0089	TRUMP	She is their puppet, and they pull the strings.
0090	TRUMP	That is why Hillary Clintons message is that things will never change.
0091	TRUMP	My message is that things have to change  and they have to change right now.
0092	TRUMP	Every day I wake up determined to deliver for the people I have met all across this nation that have been neglected, ignored, and abandoned.
0093	TRUMP	I have visited the laidoff factory workers, and the communities crushed by our horrible and unfair trade deals.
0094	TRUMP	These are the forgotten men and women of our country.
0095	TRUMP	People who work hard but no longer have a voice.
0096	TRUMP	I AM YOUR VOICE.
0097	TRUMP	I have embraced crying mothers who have lost their children because our politicians put their personal agendas before the national good.
0098	TRUMP	I have no patience for injustice, no tolerance for government incompetence, no sympathy for leaders who fail their citizens.
0099	TRUMP	When innocent people suffer, because our political system lacks the will, or the courage, or the basic decency to enforce our laws  or worse still, has sold out to some corporate lobbyist for cash  I am not able to look the other way.
0100	TRUMP	And when a Secretary of State illegally stores her emails on a private server, deletes 33,000 of them so the authorities cant see her crime, puts our country at risk, lies about it in every different form and faces no consequence  I know that corruption has reached a level like never before.
0101	TRUMP	When the FBI Director says that the Secretary of State was extremely careless and negligent, in handling our classified secrets, I also know that these terms are minor compared to what she actually did.
0102	TRUMP	They were just used to save her from facing justice for her terrible crimes.
0103	TRUMP	In fact, her single greatest accomplishment may be committing such an egregious crime and getting away with it  especially when others have paid so dearly.
0104	TRUMP	When that same Secretary of State rakes in millions of dollars trading access and favors to special interests and foreign powers I know the time for action has come.
0105	TRUMP	I have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people that cannot defend themselves.
0106	TRUMP	Nobody knows the system better than me, which is why I alone can fix it.
0107	TRUMP	I have seen firsthand how the system is rigged against our citizens, just like it was rigged against Bernie Sanders  he never had a chance.
0108	TRUMP	But his supporters will join our movement, because we will fix his biggest issue trade.
0109	TRUMP	Millions of Democrats will join our movement because we are going to fix the system so it works for all Americans.
0110	TRUMP	In this cause, I am proud to have at my side the next Vice President of the United States Governor Mike Pence of Indiana.
0111	TRUMP	We will bring the same economic success to America that Mike brought to Indiana.
0112	TRUMP	He is a man of character and accomplishment.
0113	TRUMP	He is the right man for the job.
0114	TRUMP	The first task for our new Administration will be to liberate our citizens from the crime and terrorism and lawlessness that threatens their communities.
0115	TRUMP	America was shocked to its core when our police officers in Dallas were brutally executed.
0116	TRUMP	In the days after Dallas, we have seen continued threats and violence against our law enforcement officials.
0117	TRUMP	Law officers have been shot or killed in recent days in Georgia, Missouri, Wisconsin, Kansas, Michigan and Tennessee.
0118	TRUMP	On Sunday, more police were gunned down in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
0119	TRUMP	Three were killed, and four were badly injured.
0120	TRUMP	An attack on law enforcement is an attack on all Americans.
0121	TRUMP	I have a message to every last person threatening the peace on our streets and the safety of our police when I take the oath of office next year, I will restore law and order our country.
0122	TRUMP	Leaked document Trump will tell the nation, 'I am your voice' By ELI STOKOLS and NICK GASS I will work with, and appoint, the best prosecutors and law enforcement officials in the country to get the job done.
0123	TRUMP	In this race for the White House, I am the Law And Order candidate.
0124	TRUMP	The irresponsible rhetoric of our President, who has used the pulpit of the presidency to divide us by race and color, has made America a more dangerous environment for everyone.
0125	TRUMP	This Administration has failed Americas inner cities.
0126	TRUMP	Its failed them on education.
0127	TRUMP	Its failed them on jobs.
0128	TRUMP	Its failed them on crime.
0129	TRUMP	Its failed them at every level.
0130	TRUMP	When I am President, I will work to ensure that all of our kids are treated equally, and protected equally.
0131	TRUMP	Every action I take, I will ask myself does this make life better for young Americans in Baltimore, Chicago, Detroit, Ferguson who have as much of a right to live out their dreams as any other child America?
0132	TRUMP	To make life safe in America, we must also address the growing threats we face from outside America we are going to defeat the barbarians of ISIS.
0133	TRUMP	Once again, France is the victim of brutal Islamic terrorism.
0134	TRUMP	Men, women and children viciously mowed down.
0135	TRUMP	Lives ruined.
0136	TRUMP	Families ripped apart.
0137	TRUMP	A nation in mourning.
0138	TRUMP	The damage and devastation that can be inflicted by Islamic radicals has been over and over  at the World Trade Center, at an office party in San Bernardino, at the Boston Marathon, and a military recruiting center in Chattanooga, Tennessee.
0139	TRUMP	Only weeks ago, in Orlando, Florida, 49 wonderful Americans were savagely murdered by an Islamic terrorist.
0140	TRUMP	This time, the terrorist targeted our LGBT community.
0141	TRUMP	As your President, I will do everything in my power to protect our LGBT citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology.
0142	TRUMP	To protect us from terrorism, we need to focus on three things.
0143	TRUMP	We must have the best intelligence gathering operation in the world.
0144	TRUMP	We must abandon the failed policy of nation building and regime change that Hillary Clinton pushed in Iraq, Libya, Egypt and Syria.
0145	TRUMP	Instead, we must work with all of our allies who share our goal of destroying ISIS and stamping out Islamic terror.
0146	TRUMP	This includes working with our greatest ally in the region, the State of Israel.
0147	TRUMP	Lastly, we must immediately suspend immigration from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism until such time as proven vetting mechanisms have been put in place.
0148	TRUMP	My opponent has called for a radical 550% increase in Syrian refugees on top of existing massive refugee flows coming into our country under President Obama.
0149	TRUMP	She proposes this despite the fact that theres no way to screen these refugees in order to find out who they are or where they come from.
0150	TRUMP	I only want to admit individuals into our country who will support our values and love our people.
0151	TRUMP	Anyone who endorses violence, hatred or oppression is not welcome in our country and never will be.
0152	TRUMP	Decades of record immigration have produced lower wages and higher unemployment for our citizens, especially for AfricanAmerican and Latino workers.
0153	TRUMP	We are going to have an immigration system that works, but one that works for the American people.
0154	TRUMP	On Monday, we heard from three parents whose children were killed by illegal immigrants Mary Ann Mendoza, Sabine Durden, and Jamiel Shaw.
0155	TRUMP	They are just three brave representatives of many thousands.
0156	TRUMP	Of all my travels in this country, nothing has affected me more deeply than the time I have spent with the mothers and fathers who have lost their children to violence spilling across our border.
0157	TRUMP	These families have no special interests to represent them.
0158	TRUMP	There are no demonstrators to protest on their behalf.
0159	TRUMP	My opponent will never meet with them, or share in their pain.
0160	TRUMP	Instead, my opponent wants Sanctuary Cities.
0161	TRUMP	But where was sanctuary for Kate Steinle?
0162	TRUMP	Where was Sanctuary for the children of Mary Ann, Sabine and Jamiel?
0163	TRUMP	Where was sanctuary for all the other Americans who have been so brutally murdered, and who have suffered so horribly?
0164	TRUMP	These wounded American families have been alone.
0165	TRUMP	But they are alone no longer.
0166	TRUMP	Tonight, this candidate and this whole nation stand in their corner to support them, to send them our love, and to pledge in their honor that we will save countless more families from suffering the same awful fate.
0167	TRUMP	We are going to build a great border wall to stop illegal immigration, to stop the gangs and the violence, and to stop the drugs from pouring into our communities.
0168	TRUMP	I have been honored to receive the endorsement of Americas Border Patrol Agents, and will work directly with them to protect the integrity of our lawful immigration system.
0169	TRUMP	By ending catchandrelease on the border, we will stop the cycle of human smuggling and violence.
0170	TRUMP	Illegal border crossings will go down.
0171	TRUMP	Peace will be restored.
0172	TRUMP	By enforcing the rules for the millions who overstay their visas, our laws will finally receive the respect they deserve.
0173	TRUMP	Tonight, I want every American whose demands for immigration security have been denied  and every politician who has denied them  to listen very closely to the words I am about to say.
0174	TRUMP	On January 21st of 2017, the day after I take the oath of office, Americans will finally wake up in a country where the laws of the United States are enforced.
0175	TRUMP	We are going to be considerate and compassionate to everyone.
0176	TRUMP	But my greatest compassion will be for our own struggling citizens.
0177	TRUMP	My plan is the exact opposite of the radical and dangerous immigration policy of Hillary Clinton.
0178	TRUMP	Americans want relief from uncontrolled immigration.
0179	TRUMP	Communities want relief.
0180	TRUMP	Yet Hillary Clinton is proposing mass amnesty, mass immigration, and mass lawlessness.
0181	TRUMP	Her plan will overwhelm your schools and hospitals, further reduce your jobs and wages, and make it harder for recent immigrants to escape from poverty.
0182	TRUMP	I have a different vision for our workers.
0183	TRUMP	It begins with a new, fair trade policy that protects our jobs and stands up to countries that cheat.
0184	TRUMP	Its been a signature message of my campaign from day one, and it will be a signature feature of my presidency from the moment I take the oath of office.
0185	TRUMP	I have made billions of dollars in business making deals  now Im going to make our country rich again.
0186	TRUMP	I am going to turn our bad trade agreements into great ones.
0187	TRUMP	America has lost nearlyone third of its manufacturing jobs since 1997, following the enactment of disastrous trade deals supported by Bill and Hillary Clinton.
0188	TRUMP	Remember, it was Bill Clinton who signed NAFTA, one of the worst economic deals ever made by our country.
0189	TRUMP	Never again.
0190	TRUMP	I am going to bring our jobs back to Ohio and to America  and I am not going to let companies move to other countries, firing their employees along the way, without consequences.
0191	TRUMP	My opponent, on the other hand, has supported virtually every trade agreement that has been destroying our middle class.
0192	TRUMP	She supported NAFTA, and she supported Chinas entrance into the World Trade Organization  another one of her husbands colossal mistakes.
0193	TRUMP	She supported the job killing trade deal with South Korea.
0194	TRUMP	She has supported the TransPacific Partnership.
0195	TRUMP	The TPP will not only destroy our manufacturing, but it will make America subject to the rulings of foreign governments.
0196	TRUMP	I pledge to never sign any trade agreement that hurts our workers, or that diminishes our freedom and independence.
0197	TRUMP	Instead, I will make individual deals with individual countries.
0198	TRUMP	No longer will we enter into these massive deals, with many countries, that are thousands of pages long  and which no one from our country even reads or understands.
0199	TRUMP	We are going to enforce all trade violations, including through the use of taxes and tariffs, against any country that cheats.
0200	TRUMP	This includes stopping Chinas outrageous theft of intellectual property, along with their illegal product dumping, and their devastating currency manipulation.
0201	TRUMP	Our horrible trade agreements with China and many others, will be totally renegotiated.
0202	TRUMP	That includes renegotiating NAFTA to get a much better deal for America  and well walk away if we dont get the deal that we want.
0203	TRUMP	We are going to start building and making things again.
0204	TRUMP	Next comes the reform of our tax laws, regulations and energy rules.
0205	TRUMP	While Hillary Clinton plans a massive tax increase, I have proposed the largest tax reduction of any candidate who has declared for the presidential race this year  Democrat or Republican.
0206	TRUMP	Middleincome Americans will experience profound relief, and taxes will be simplified for everyone.
0207	TRUMP	America is one of the highesttaxed nations in the world.
0208	TRUMP	Reducing taxes will cause new companies and new jobs to come roaring back into our country.
0209	TRUMP	Then we are going to deal with the issue of regulation, one of the greatest jobkillers of them all.
0210	TRUMP	Excessive regulation is costing our country as much as $2 trillion a year, and we will end it.
0211	TRUMP	We are going to lift the restrictions on the production of American energy.
0212	TRUMP	This will produce more than $20 trillion in job creating economic activity over the next four decades.
0213	TRUMP	My opponent, on the other hand, wants to put the great miners and steel workers of our country out of work  that will never happen when I am President.
0214	TRUMP	With these new economic policies, trillions of dollars will start flowing into our country.
0215	TRUMP	This new wealth will improve the quality of life for all Americans  We will build the roads, highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, and the railways of tomorrow.
0216	TRUMP	This, in turn, will create millions more jobs.
0217	TRUMP	We will rescue kids from failing schools by helping their parents send them to a safe school of their choice.
0218	TRUMP	My opponent would rather protect education bureaucrats than serve American children.
0219	TRUMP	We will repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare.
0220	TRUMP	You will be able to choose your own doctor again.
0221	TRUMP	And we will fix TSA at the airports!
0222	TRUMP	We will completely rebuild our depleted military, and the countries that we protect, at a massive loss, will be asked to pay their fair share.
0223	TRUMP	We will take care of our great Veterans like they have never been taken care of before.
0224	TRUMP	My opponent dismissed the VA scandal as being not widespread  one more sign of how out of touch she really is.
0225	TRUMP	We are going to ask every Department Head in government to provide a list of wasteful spending projects that we can eliminate in my first 100 days.
0226	TRUMP	The politicians have talked about it, Im going to do it.
0227	TRUMP	We are also going to appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold our laws and our Constitution.
0228	TRUMP	The replacement for Justice Scalia will be a person of similar views and principles.
0229	TRUMP	This will be one of the most important issues decided by this election.
0230	TRUMP	My opponent wants to essentially abolish the 2nd amendment.
0231	TRUMP	I, on the other hand, received the early and strong endorsement of the National Rifle Association and will protect the right of all Americans to keep their families safe.
0232	TRUMP	At this moment, I would like to thank the evangelical community who have been so good to me and so supportive.
0233	TRUMP	You have so much to contribute to our politics, yet our laws prevent you from speaking your minds from your own pulpits.
0234	TRUMP	An amendment, pushed by Lyndon Johnson, many years ago, threatens religious institutions with a loss of their taxexempt status if they openly advocate their political views.
0235	TRUMP	I am going to work very hard to repeal that language and protect free speech for all Americans.
0236	TRUMP	We can accomplish these great things, and so much else  all we need to do is start believing in ourselves and in our country again.
0237	TRUMP	It is time to show the whole world that America Is Back  bigger, and better and stronger than ever before.
0238	TRUMP	In this journey, I'm so lucky to have at my side my wife Melania and my wonderful children, Don, Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany, and Barron you will always be my greatest source of pride and joy.
0239	TRUMP	My Dad, Fred Trump, was the smartest and hardest working man I ever knew.
0240	TRUMP	I wonder sometimes what hed say if he were here to see this tonight.
0241	TRUMP	Its because of him that I learned, from my youngest age, to respect the dignity of work and the dignity of working people.
0242	TRUMP	He was a guy most comfortable in the company of bricklayers, carpenters, and electricians and I have a lot of that in me also.
0243	TRUMP	Then theres my mother, Mary.
0244	TRUMP	She was strong, but also warm and fairminded.
0245	TRUMP	She was a truly great mother.
0246	TRUMP	She was also one of the most honest and charitable people I have ever known, and a great judge of character.
0247	TRUMP	To my sisters Mary Anne and Elizabeth, my brother Robert and my late brother Fred, I will always give you my love you are most special to me.
0248	TRUMP	I have loved my life in business.
0249	TRUMP	But now, my sole and exclusive mission is to go to work for our country  to go to work for all of you.
0250	TRUMP	Its time to deliver a victory for the American people.
0251	TRUMP	But to do that, we must break free from the petty politics of the past.
0252	TRUMP	America is a nation of believers, dreamers, and strivers that is being led by a group of censors, critics, and cynics.
0253	TRUMP	Remember all of the people telling you that you cant have the country you want, are the same people telling you that I wouldnt be standing here tonight.
0254	TRUMP	No longer can we rely on those elites in media, and politics, who will say anything to keep a rigged system in place.
0255	TRUMP	Instead, we must choose to Believe In America.
0256	TRUMP	History is watching us now.
0257	TRUMP	Its waiting to see if we will rise to the occasion, and if we will show the whole world that America is still free and independent and strong.
0258	TRUMP	My opponent asks her supporters to recite a threeword loyalty pledge.
0259	TRUMP	It reads Im With Her.
0260	TRUMP	I choose to recite a different pledge.
0261	TRUMP	My pledge reads IM WITH YOU  THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. I am your voice.
0262	TRUMP	So to every parent who dreams for their child, and every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight Im With You, and I will fight for you, and I will win for you.
0263	TRUMP	To all Americans tonight, in all our cities and towns, I make this promise We Will Make America Strong Again.
0264	TRUMP	We Will Make America Proud Again.
0265	TRUMP	We Will Make America Safe Again.
0266	TRUMP	And We Will Make America Great Again.
0267	TRUMP	THANK YOU.
