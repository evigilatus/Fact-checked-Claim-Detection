Ilhan Omar saying the Democratic Minnesota congresswoman \"wants to redefine U.S. foreign policy as we know it.\"\nOmar elaborated on her philosophy by addressing military spending.\n\"We can fight to have our Green New Deal. We can certainly get Medicare for All. We can cancel out student debt. We can certainly pass our Housing for All bill. We can get a universal school meals program up and running,\" she said.\u00a0\n\"But in order to do all of those things, we have to stop policing the world, right? We have to not have over 800 military bases around the world. We have to not spend 57 cents on the dollar on defense.\"\nOmar\u2019s major claim is wrong.\u00a0\nDefense spending accounts for only 15% of the federal budget.\n57% was wrong before\nIn 2015, we rated as False a claim that 57% of federal spending goes to the military and just 1% goes to food and agriculture, including food stamps.\nRather than being dominated by the military, the budget was actually dominated by spending on Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, we found.\nAt the time, military spending, including spending on homeland security, accounted for 54% of discretionary spending \u2014 that is, not-mandatory spending.\u00a0\nBut it accounted for only 16% of federal spending overall.\n\"This is a common mistake,\" Robert Bixby, executive director of the centrist Concord Coalition, which works for fiscal responsibility, said about Omar\u2019s claim.\nIn fact, a spokesman for the congresswoman said Omar was referring to discretionary funding. He cited a Washington Post article that says defense would be 57% of discretionary spending in the 2020 federal budget request unveiled by President Donald Trump in March 2019.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefense percentage steady\nThe percentage of the total federal budget spent on defense has been in the same range for years.\n2007: 19%, FactCheck.org found\n2011: About 25%, according to the Washington Post Fact Checker\n2017: 15% according to the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities\nCurrently, about 17% of the federal budget goes toward defense, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office \u2014 a figure confirmed to us by Marc Goldwein of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\u00a0\nThe Peter G.
