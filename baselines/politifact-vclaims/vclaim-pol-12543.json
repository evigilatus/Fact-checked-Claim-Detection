Chris Christie to sign a bill aimed at protecting homeowners from foreclosure rescue scams.\n\nForeclosure consultants could charge homeowners with the promise of helping them avoid or postpone foreclosure. In some cases, clients could end up turning over their homes, paying rent to live there and then getting evicted.\n\n\"New Jersey continues to be the \u2018Wild West\u2019 of foreclosure consulting,\" Schaer, one of the bill\u2019s sponsors, said in the press release. \"Hair stylists are required to undergo more government scrutiny than foreclosure consultants.\"\n\nCould hair stylists really face more government requirements than foreclosure consultants?\n\nPolitiFact New Jersey discovered that Schaer\u2019s claim was accurate. Hair stylists must receive a license and follow other regulations, while Schaer\u2019s bill would actually outline the first regulations for so-called \"foreclosure consultants.\"\n\nHowever, individuals providing such consulting services as \"debt adjusters\" face state regulations, and a new federal law already imposes requirements similar to those under Schaer\u2019s bill.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s talk about the regulatory environment faced by hair stylists.\n\nAccording to 23 pages of state regulations, hairstyling and other related positions require a license from the New Jersey State Board of Cosmetology and Hairstyling. Hair stylists and barbers must complete an educational course, and pass an exam conducted by the board.\n\nBy contrast, there are no state regulations for \"foreclosure consultants,\" because the term doesn\u2019t exist under state law, according to Marshall McKnight, spokesman for the New Jersey Department of Banking & Insurance. The bill sponsored by Schaer would define that term and lay out the new regulations, McKnight said.\n\nUnder the bill, known as the \"Foreclosure Rescue Fraud Prevention Act,\" the new requirements for foreclosure consultants would include securing a license from the Commissioner of Banking & Insurance and undergoing a criminal background check.\n\n\"People are being scammed on a constant basis,\" Schaer said in a phone interview. \"There\u2019s no oversight at all.\"\n\nBut most of the foreclosure consultants\u2019 activities listed in the bill are covered by the state\u2019s Debt Adjuster Act, which requires \"debt adjusters\" to be licensed to act as intermediaries between a debtor and his creditors. In essence, debt adjusters can perform a type of foreclosure consulting, but they must be licensed -- just like hair stylists.\n\nIn 2008, state officials issued warnings about individuals or entities advertising or performing foreclosure consulting and other services. Those warnings indicated that providing such services requires a debt adjuster\u2019s license.\n\nPeggy Jurow, a senior attorney with the Anti-Predatory Lending Project at Legal Services of New Jersey, said foreclosure consultants are subject to the state\u2019s Consumer Fraud Act, but otherwise, they\u2019re not regulated.\n\nSo, Schaer\u2019s bill marks new territory in regulating \"foreclosure consultants.\"\n\nChristie spokesman Kevin Roberts said the governor has until Thursday to take action on the legislation, which was passed unanimously by the Legislature on June 29.\n\n\"As with all pieces of pending legislation, it is receiving the careful review of our counsel\u2019s office prior to the Governor taking action,\" Roberts said in an email.\n\nNow, even though Schaer\u2019s statement refers to state regulations, let\u2019s take a quick look at how federal law regulates foreclosure rescue services.\n\nFederal regulations don\u2019t require licensing or background checks for foreclosure rescue consultants, but a new law from the Federal Trade Commission mandates requirements similar to those under Schaer\u2019s bill.\n\nCalled the Mortgage Assistance Relief Services (MARS) Rule, that law prohibits foreclosure rescue service providers from receiving fees until homeowners get a written offer from their lenders. All of the rule\u2019s provisions were in effect as of Jan. 31.\n\nThe ruling\n\nSchaer claimed hair stylists must \"undergo more government scrutiny than foreclosure consultants.\" He\u2019s right, because there are no existing state regulations governing foreclosure consultants. That term and the regulations would come from Schaer\u2019s bill.\n\nForeclosure consulting done by \"debt adjusters\" requires a state license, but since Schaer\u2019s statement was in reference to \"foreclosure consultants,\" we rate the statement True.\n\nTo comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMichael Bloomberg\n\n\nstated on September 6, 2011 in a speech in Lower Manhattan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Over the past 10 years, the number of people living in Lower Manhattan has nearly doubled.
