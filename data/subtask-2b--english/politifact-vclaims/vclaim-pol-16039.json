Yet, Barack Obama and Joe Biden oppose new drilling at home and oppose nuclear power. Either they don't understand the seriousness of the energy situation or they aren't giving straight answers to the American people,\" the RNC opined.\n\n\nIt's true that Obama and Biden have opposed expanded offshore drilling in the past. However, Obama has said that he would accept drilling\n\nas part of a compromise bill\n\nthat enacts broader energy reforms. We weren't able to find any public statements from Biden on the energy compromise.\n\n\nThe RNC is on considerably shakier ground when it says Obama and Biden oppose nuclear power.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharlie Kirk\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Joe Biden admits he is governing like a 'dictator.'\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Daniel Funke \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObama has said that nuclear power \"has to be part of our energy mix\" in attaining energy independence, though it does require environmental safeguards. He's also said that he hopes developing technology will provide better answers to the problem of nuclear waste storage.\n\n\nBiden's position is similar; he has said nuclear energy \"must be part of our future\" but that \"serious safety, security and waste issues must be solved.\"\n\n\nHaving concerns about safety, though, doesn't mean you're against nuclear energy, and Obama and Biden have specifically said that they support nuclear energy. Obama's position on drilling has some flexibility as well. Given that much of the RNC's statement is not correct, we rate their statement Barely True.\n\n\n\nEditor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16039"}
