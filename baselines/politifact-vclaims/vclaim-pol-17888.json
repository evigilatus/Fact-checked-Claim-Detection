(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nWe found a June 2 Reddit post that shared the image, describing it as Trump\u2019s star getting destroyed \"again.\" But a moderator flagged it for violating one of the rules of the forum where it was shared: \"Your title must convey accurate information.\"\u00a0\nThe Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, which manages the Walk of Fame on behalf of the City of Los Angeles, did not immediately respond to PolitiFact\u2019s email about the Facebook post\u2019s claim. But searching online for news about Donald Trump and the Walk of Fame in the last month, we didn\u2019t find any credible sources corroborating the Facebook post. Rather, we found three other fact-checks debunking it.\u00a0\nWe rate this post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17888"}
