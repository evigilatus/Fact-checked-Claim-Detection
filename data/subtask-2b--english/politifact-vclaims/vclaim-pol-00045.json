Ojeda, II (@VoteOjeda2020) August 20, 2019 \nIs the number that large? When we reached out to Ojeda, he said we should look at the federal statistics and \"just do the research.\"\u00a0\nWe did, and we found that his numbers were actually an understatement.\u00a0\nThe official data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides the number of gun-related deaths nationally. The most recent year for which data is available is 2017. Here are the figures:\nHomicides: 14,542 deaths by guns\nSuicides: 23,854 deaths by guns\nOther: 1,377 deaths by guns\nTotal deaths by guns: 39,773\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat works out to 3,314 total gun-related deaths nationally per month, and 1,212 gun-related homicides per month. Both figures are much higher than Ojeda\u2019s estimate of 75 to 100 per month.\u00a0\nHowever, Ojeda\u2019s figures would have been in the ballpark if he had been talking about gun-related deaths per day. There are about 109 gun-related deaths per day, about 40 of which are homicides and 65 of which are suicides.\nWe also checked to see if the numbers work for firearm deaths in West Virginia alone. They don\u2019t -- in this case, the number is too small. West Virginia saw 348 total deaths from guns in 2017, which works out to 29 per month, or close to one a day.\nWhat about injuries? The CDC has data on that as well.\u00a0\nIn 2015, the most recent year available, there were 84,997 non-fatal injuries by guns nationally. That works out to 7,083 per month, a number well above the 200 Ojeda cited.\nHere, too, the data fits better if it\u2019s calculated on a per-day basis. There were about 233 non-fatal injuries per day. That\u2019s not far off from the number Ojeda offered.\nAll told, though, his numbers are far off from what he said in the tweet.\nOur ruling\nOjeda tweeted that \"75-100 folks (are) killed a month and over 200 wounded by senseless gun violence.\"\nIn fact, Ojeda understated the number of deaths and injuries from guns. His numbers are roughly right for gun deaths and injuries per day, rather than per month.\u00a0\nWe rate his statement Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00045"}
