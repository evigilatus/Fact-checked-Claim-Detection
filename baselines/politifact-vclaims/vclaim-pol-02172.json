We wanted to look into the claim.\nThe article cites a message leaked by Wikileaks from when Clinton was secretary of state.\n\"The new Wikileaks release shows the then Secretary of State ordering a war in Syria in order to overthrow the government and oust President Assad, claiming that \u2018the best way to help Israel deal with Iran\u2019s growing nuclear capability is to help the people of Syria overthrow the regime of Bashar Assad.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Clinton did not write the message in the email.\nThe message is a 2012 forwarded document from former diplomat James P. Rubin offering guidance on handling the situation in Syria. Clinton forwarded the message to an aide, asking him to print it out.\nRubin\u2019s email to Clinton says she may not agree with his proposal, in which he argues that a more aggressive policy on Syria would eliminate the pressure on Israel to become involved, sparking a larger war in the Middle East.\nClinton\u2019s actual policy proposals called for the establishment of a no-fly zone and \"safe zones\" on the ground for Syrian nationals. Her stance on Syria also included more airstrikes against the Islamic State.\nAnother piece of information that was left out of the article was the conclusion of the document. Rubin said taking stronger action in Syria could protect other civilians from the war raged by President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime. Israel\u2019s hesitance to act was noted as a secondary victory.\nThe email attributed to Clinton in the Your News Wire story were not written by Clinton.
