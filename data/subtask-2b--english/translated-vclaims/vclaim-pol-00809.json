A Facebook message cautions users that hackers somehow get access to accounts after \"video and sex pictures\" on people's walls that they can't see - but their friends can. Here's the full warning: \"An immediate warning to all Facebook users! Be careful friends! This is serious! The hackers are posting videos and sex pictures on your walls. You don't see them, but your friends see them, and then you seem to have published it. If you see any such garbage published under my name, please let me know because I didn't put it! You share this to protect yourself and your friends.\" The article was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The alarm is so vague that it does not make it a credible security warning, nor does it elaborate on how these hackers enter the accounts, nor does it provide any solution besides telling users to let someone know if they see this activity on Facebook walls with others, which does not provide any permanent repair. Clifford Newman, a cyber security expert and director of the Computer Systems Security Centre of the University of Southern California, told Polyte Fruitte that he had seen no reliable evidence of warning. But he says it's not entirely impossible. \"If social media platforms give one of these the ability to spread an enabling code (or any other written language) to a wall, someone can put something on your wall in a way that can prevent you from seeing it,\" Newman wrote in an e-mail. While malignant programs have spread in the past using similar techniques, he has seen no evidence that this is happening now. On January 10, 2021 in Facebook, it says that Nancy Belusi sent a letter to the mayor of Portland after demonstrations there \"inducing him to abide by the proven book of democratic play.\" By Sierra Aurork on January 11, 2021, other fact-checking sites also looked at the validity of these kinds of warnings, some dating back to 2011, when there was a warning of similar \"threat\" hacked e-mails. If hackers have access to accounts, security organizations and technology websites often say that this is because the user inadvertently allowed this to happen. This can be achieved by mistakenly downloading unreliable Internet applications that allow the publication of e-mails or frauds as comments or on walls, and may provide unauthorized access to personal information. This can also be done by opening letters and links from suspicious senders or providing personal information in fishing schemes. Some of the steps to be taken to avoid this include enhancing and often changing your passwords, separating applications that appear suspicious and enhancing security settings, such as employee certifications and checking your access logs (you can do this on Facebook by visiting your settings and then clicking on security and access). Noman advised similar safety steps on the Internet. Strong passwords and online scrutiny of your partners are essential for survival. \"Use a powerful password at the expense of your social media, a password different from that used on any other website,\" said Newman, \"Be careful who you accept as friends on these platforms. Many users will brag about getting thousands of friends because it makes them feel important, but when they ask how many \"friends\" they actually know, they're losing the answer. Our Facebook ruling warnings claim that pirates publish \"video and sexual images\" on users' walls without being able to see them. There is no credible evidence that this threat is real, and warnings remain vague and non-sourced. The re-orientation of these warnings will not keep anyone safe online, and cyber security experts say that people should instead enhance the security of their accounts and avoid the installation of third-party applications. This allegation is false. Sharing the facts 2019-04-03 19:37:42 UTC Politic Fact 2 1 7 PoliticFacting: failed \"Hackers posting videos and sex pictures on your walls (Facebook)!
