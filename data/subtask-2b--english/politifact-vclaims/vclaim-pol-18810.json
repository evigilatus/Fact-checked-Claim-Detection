The message is that Biden\u2019s stumble was his staff\u2019s cue to hustle reporters away.\u00a0\nIn reality, the full video shows that Biden gave a lengthy answer, and then Biden\u2019s staff began moving members of the press to attend the next campaign event.\u00a0\nThe deceptive clip is now part of Trump\u2019s rallies, appearing most recently at his Oct. 28 rally in Arizona.\nIt started when Francis Brennan, the Trump campaign\u2019s director of strategic response, tweeted the video excerpt. The campaign shared it that day on the Team Trump Facebook page and on Trump\u2019s YouTube account.\n\"MUST WATCH: When asked about court-packing, Biden's staff immediately escorts the camera out,\" read the headline of the YouTube video posted to Trump\u2019s YouTube page.\nThe video clip is from Biden\u2019s Oct. 26 appearance in Pennsylvania. It shows him talking with a small semi-circle of people.\nThe clip begins with Biden\u2019s signature pivot, \"Here\u2019s the deal.\"\u00a0\n\"One of the reasons that is important,\" Biden continues. \"Keep in mind, although they are going to vote on ...\"\nAt this point, Biden pauses. Members of the press are in motion, moving and shifting away from where Biden is speaking with supporters.\nAccording to the Trump campaign, Biden\u2019s staff were moving the press to protect him as he began to stumble.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL. Lin Wood\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in an interview with the Patriotically Correct Radio Show\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"China was behind the interference and the effort to overthrow our government and the election, election fraud.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Daniel Funke \u2022 January 19, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the full video, as streamed by ABC News and others, shows a different sequence.\nIn the full video, Biden answers the question\nIn the ABC News video, a supporter asks Biden about court packing by Republicans (see minute 4:50). Biden gives a long answer about forming a commission to explore options in federal judicial appointments, which are lifetime appointments.\n\"I\u2019m not a big fan of court packing,\" Biden said. \"I\u2019m going to listen to all of the ideas.\"\nBiden said his commission would include conservative, liberal and middle-of-the-road scholars and would have six months to give him a list of options.\nAfter Biden finished, he joked with a nearby reporter and started talking about the courts again (which is where the Trump clip picks up).\u00a0\nThe video shows that Biden is going on at even greater length with a single reporter as other reporters Biden started to move away. (See 6:45 in the video.).\u00a0\nMembers of the media were directed down a path to a more open area where a lectern had been set up.\u00a0\nBiden later went to the lectern to take more questions. Asked about his plans for the Supreme Court, he repeated the answer he\u2019d given earlier.\nOur ruling\nThe Trump campaign said that Biden staff hustled reporters away to cut off his stumbling answer to a question. The full video shows a different scene.\nBiden had already given a long answer to a question about court packing and seemed to be following up with one reporter for even more comments. The Trump video plucks one moment out of context.\nWe rate this claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18810"}
