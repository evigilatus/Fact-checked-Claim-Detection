And we have to ask: Back to what? Back to the failed policies that drove us into this deep recession? Back to the days of record job losses? Back to the days when insurance companies called being a woman a \u2018pre-existing condition,\u2019 \" O\u2019Malley said, speaking at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C.\n\n\"No, thank you. I don't want to go back. Do you? Instead of a balanced, achievable plan to create jobs and reduce the deficit, Mitt Romney says, puts forward a plan that would cut taxes for millionaires while raising them for the middle class.\"\n\nWe should note O\u2019Malley\u2019s remarks were modified from the advance transcript sent to reporters. In the advance version, O\u2019Malley said more simply, \"Mitt Romney says he will cut taxes for millionaires and raise them for the middle class.\"\n\nThe idea is clear enough, though: Romney wants to cut taxes for millionaires while raising taxes on the middle class.\n\nSo does he?\n\nThat\u2019s not how he would explain his own plan. Romney would say he wants lower tax rates for everyone.\n\nBut it\u2019s not quite that simple. Let us explain.\n\nRomney\u2019s tax plan\n\nGenerally speaking, Romney\u2019s plan would lower tax rates for everyone while getting rid of exemptions, deductions and loopholes. That way, people would pay lower tax rates, but more income would be subject to taxes, so the changes wouldn\u2019t blow a hole in the deficit.\n\nOther ideas from his tax plan: eliminating interest, dividend and capital gains taxes for taxpayers earning less than $200,000; eliminating the estate tax; repealing the Alternative Minimum Tax; and cutting the corporate rate to 25 percent.\n\nRomney has said he wants to keep tax rates low on savings and investment, which tend to benefit the millionaires. But he\u2019s also said that people at the high end \"will still pay the same share of the tax burden they\u2019re paying now,\" which suggests he wants to maintain the current progressive system where people pay more taxes as a percentage of income if they make more.\n\nThe biggest sticking point -- especially for fact-checkers and independent analysts trying to analyze Romney\u2019s plan -- is that Romney hasn\u2019t specified what exemptions, deductions and loopholes he wants to get rid of. It\u2019s impossible to tell if Romney\u2019s math adds up.\n\nThe Tax Policy Center analysis\n\nOne group that\u2019s tried to unpack his plan is the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan tax analysis group that has analyzed tax plans put forward by candidates and officials. The group's report, first published on Aug. 1, 2012, analyzed Romney\u2019s plan by choosing common exemptions and deductions to scrub from the tax code.\n\nThe Tax Policy Center had to choose on its own what exemptions and deductions to get rid of, but the analysts tried to select the ones that most conformed to the principles Romney has outlined. (The Tax Policy Center refers to them as \"tax preferences.\")\n\nStill, the math didn\u2019t work. If the tax plan is to generate the same amount of revenue and offer across-the-board tax cuts, some exemptions for the middle class would go away. \"As a result, a revenue-neutral reform within these constraints would cut taxes at the high-end while raising them in the middle and perhaps bottom,\" wrote Donald Marron, the center\u2019s director, in a blog post about the study.\n\nMeanwhile, the across-the-board rate reductions would benefit the wealthy, who overall would see lower tax burdens, according to the center\u2019s analysis.\n\nThe Obama campaign has used the study as evidence for its claims that Romney\u2019s plan means tax increases for the middle class. When the campaign puts those claims in the proper context, it\u2019s a reasonable point. Romney\u2019s tax plan is lacking in details, and the Tax Policy Center\u2019s conclusions are compelling evidence. Depending on how the Obama team has phrased it, we\u2019ve rated their claims anywhere from Half True to Mostly True.\n\nIn this case, O'Malley goes too far to declare Romney\u2019s plan a tax increase on the middle class.\n\nMarron of the Tax Policy Center says there is insufficient evidence for the harsh Democratic talking points that have evolved since the policy center released its report: \u00a0\"I don\u2019t interpret (the report) as evidence that Gov. Romney wants to increase taxes on the middle class in order to cut taxes for the rich, as an Obama campaign ad claimed. Instead, I view it as showing that his plan can\u2019t accomplish all his stated objectives. One can charitably view his plan as a combination of political signaling and the opening offer in what would, if he gets elected, become a negotiation.\"\n\nSupporters of Romney\u2019s plan have said it\u2019s not fair for the Tax Policy Center to select which tax preferences to get rid of, and that they\u2019re assuming tax increases that aren\u2019t part of Romney\u2019s plan. We reviewed their study and found that it did make assumptions, but that those assumptions tried to give the Romney campaign the benefit of the doubt.\n\nOur ruling\n\nO\u2019Malley said at the Democratic National Convention, \"Mitt Romney . . . \u00a0puts forward a plan that would cut taxes for millionaires while raising them for the middle class.\" Actually, Romney\u2019s plan includes across-the-board tax cuts for everyone, including millionaires. It does not specifically include tax increases on the middle class.\n\nBut Romney\u2019s tax plan is vague and doesn\u2019t appear to be able to keep all its promises. Romney has said he wants to eliminate deductions while cutting tax rates for everyone; bring in the same amount of revenue for the government; keep a higher burden on the wealthy; and keep low rates on savings and investments. A credible, independent analysis shows these goals are in tension with each other and don\u2019t add up. The Romney campaign has repeatedly declined to offer more specifics.\n\nIn the past, the Obama campaign has pointed to this report and framed its claims more carefully, and we\u2019ve given them positive ratings when they\u2019ve done so.\n\nHere, O\u2019Malley is blunter. He says that Romney plan \"would cut taxes for millionaires while raising them for the middle class.\" It might, but that\u2019s not what Romney says his intentions are. Instead, he would like rate cuts for everyone. We rate O\u2019Malley\u2019s claim Half True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H.
