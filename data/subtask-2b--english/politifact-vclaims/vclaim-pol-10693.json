A study commissioned by the Greater Cleveland Film Commission estimated the movie spent $25 million in Ohio and employed more than 3,870 state residents.\n\nBut is Dovilla claiming a role with landing the film in Ohio? PolitiFact Ohio decided to check into his claim.\n\nWhen the movie tax credit was established in 2009, Dovilla was not in office.\n\nLawmakers included the movie tax credit in the state budget passed that year. As a result, producers for \"The Avengers\" \u00a0chose to film part of the movie in Cleveland and ended up receiving tax credits created worth about $6.7 million, according to the Ohio Department of Development.\n\nDovilla didn\u2019t take office until 2011. Although he had nothing to do with creating the initial movie tax credit, he did sponsor legislation this year to expand the program. The expansion doubled the money available through the credit from $10 million per year to $20 million per year.\n\nWhen we contacted Dovilla to explain his claim, he said the campaign literature was not meant to establish a cause-and-effect relationship between the expansion of the movie tax credit and the decision to film part of \"The Avengers\" in Cleveland.\n\n\"It says the tax credit helped bring films like \u2018The Avengers\u2019 to Cleveland, not the expansion,\" he said.\n\nDovilla said the phrase \"which helped bring films like \u2018The Avengers\u2019 to Cleveland\" referred to the tax credit itself, not the expansion of the tax credit.\n\nDovilla also said he believes the average person in his district would know that the Avengers was filmed in Cleveland well before lawmakers extended the tax credit and, therefore, the average person would understand that the original movie tax credit \u2013 passed before Dovilla took office \u2013 brought the Avengers to Cleveland, not the expansion that he sponsored.\n\nMike Dittoe, a spokesman for House Speaker William G. Batchelder on a leave of absence to assist the GOP House campaigns, also said Dovilla\u2019s campaign literature was not meant to convey the tax credit expansion attracted \"The Avengers.\"\n\n\"You could word it this way and have the same meaning as the first: \u2018The Ohio Motion Picture Tax Credit has helped bring films like \u2018The Avengers\u2019 to Cleveland. Mike Dovilla\u2019s big ideas, like expanding that tax credit, have helped make our state No. 1 in the Midwest for job creation,\" Dittoe said in an e-mail.\n\nBut that\u2019s not what Dovilla\u2019s campaign literature says. And in PolitiFact Ohio\u2019s view, words matter.\n\nThe problem with Dovilla\u2019s claim is that there are different ways that a reader could interpret it.\n\nOne could argue, as he does, that he was championing the success of the motion picture tax credit, and touting his role in pushing for its expansion. Or, one could look at his claim and infer a clear connection between expansion of the tax credit and filming \"The Avengers\" in Cleveland.\n\nDovilla said the ad isn\u2019t meant to suggest his idea brought \"The Avengers\" to Cleveland, but a natural reading of his claim could suggest exactly that.\n\nThe ad is partially accurate \u2013 the Ohio Motion Picture Tax Credit did help bring movie jobs to the state, and Dovilla did champion the movie tax credit expansion. \u00a0\n\nBut that it leaves out important details and takes things out of context.\n\n\"The Avengers\" movie came to Cleveland due to the original tax credit, which was established before Dovilla took office. And while Dovilla supported the expansion of the credit, it does not take effect until September.\n\nOn the Truth-O-Meter, Dovilla\u2019s claim rates Half True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10693"}
