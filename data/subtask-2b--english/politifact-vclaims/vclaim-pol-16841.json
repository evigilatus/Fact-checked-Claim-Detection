Motrin and Robitussin don\u2019t mix!!! Madison, age 8, passed away just a few days ago. We\u2019ve been asked to pass this on. Doctors told her family that there have been quite a few children Madison\u2019s age that have died recently the same way that she did. The only common link between them was that they were given Motrin (ibuprofen) and Robitussin together, this caused a heart attack. They believe this is what happened to them. They told her to alert everyone to this. \u2018Do not give children both of these medicines together.\u2019 You can give them one or the other but not both. When Madison collapsed she suffered a heart attack and they were able to revive her but the loss of oxygen damaged her brain and she was put on the respirator. After this she had four strokes before she died after being taken off the respirator. Please pass this on !!!!!!!!!\"\nThe bottom of the post has the email signature: \"Lisa Lopez M.A. Children\u2019s Medical Center of Dallas Pulmonary Clinic.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThis rumor is just that \u2013\u2013 a rumor. There is no evidence to suggest that a Motrin-Robitussin combination causes heart attacks in otherwise healthy children.\nThe Children\u2019s Medical Center in Dallas, Texas, that appeared in the email signature came out to dispel the rumor in 2010, roughly a year after it started being shared.\nThe hospital\u2019s announcement said the following:\n\"In 2009, a Children\u2019s employee received the e-mail from a friend and inadvertently forwarded it from a work account. Because the employee\u2019s professional signature was included at the bottom of the e-mail, the information appeared to come from a reliable source at Children\u2019s Medical Center. This is not the case.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Gateway Pundit\n\n\nstated on January 20, 2021 in an article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWHO admits their testing grossly overstates individuals testing positive for COVID.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Noah Y. Kim \u2022 January 22, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll medications have side effects, the hospital noted, and \"parents of children with underlying medical conditions must always be vigilant about the medications their child is taking.\" The hospital statement advised parents to consult with their children\u2019s doctor or a pharmacist before mixing any over-the-counter drugs.\nThe Children\u2019s Medical Center also addressed the rumor in a tweet on Dec. 22, 2014: \"Facebook post about Motrin & Robitussin is not correct & was not posted by one of our employees.\" The tweet linked to a 2009 fact-check by Snopes on the topic.\nIt\u2019s important to note that the Food and Drug Administration does not recommend children under the age of two be given cough-cold medications. But the agency has not issued any warnings that the ingredients in Motrin (which contains ibuprofen) or Robitussin (which contains dextromethorphan and/or pseudoephedrine or sometimes chlorpheniramine) could cause heart attacks in children when combined. These ingredients are also in many other medications on the market, yet the chain email only singles out Motrin and Robitussin.\u00a0\nIf the danger of heart attacks, strokes or death was prevalent in the combination of two commonly used medications, health officials would have issued widespread public health warnings.\nMotrin alone is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, and according to the FDA, the labels of over-the-counter versions warn that for adults and children \"(nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), except aspirin, increase the risk of heart attack, heart failure, and stroke. These can be fatal. The risk is higher if you use more than directed or for longer than directed.\"\nAshley Turney, an FDA spokesperson for over-the-counter drugs, told PolitiFact that \"use of Robitussin products, with or without Motrin, is not associated with heart attacks.\" She described Robitussin as an umbrella brand containing a series of children\u2019s cough and cold products that may contain a single ingredient or combinations of dextromethorphan hydrobromide, guaifenesin, phenylephrine hydrochloride, or chlorpheniramine maleate.\n\"The recommended use, dosing, and warnings vary amongst the seven Robitussin products that are intended for use in children over 4 or 6 years,\" she said.\u00a0\nTurney noted that it\u2019s important for people to read the drug facts label directions for all over-the-counter medications.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nAn old rumor claims combining Motrin and Robitussin can cause heart attacks in children.\nThere is no evidence that giving both of these medications to children causes heart attacks. Children who are too young or have underlying medical conditions can experience adverse side effects from taking any combination of over-the-counter medicine, health officials say. Parents are recommended to talk with their child\u2019s health care provider, or a pharmacist, if they have any questions about mixing medications.\nThis rumor is False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16841"}
