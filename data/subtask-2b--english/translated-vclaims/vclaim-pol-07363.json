The accusation of Rick Perry on charges of abuse of his power: former majority leader of the House of Representatives, Tom Delay, a Republican colleague in Texas, has been involved in the violation of the Criminal Elections Act over the past 12 years. Delay said that Perry's charges were no less than chasing political witches like him. Crowley, back off the proposal. \"The point is the prosecutor who filed the indictment is not democracy in any way anyone can see, and in fact has relations with the Republicans,\" Crowley said. \"That's not true. Candy, that's not true. Deli said. \"He has relations with Obama.\" He has relations with Democrats.\" \"He has relations with the Republicans, yes?\" Crowley asked. \"Well yeah, but this has nothing to do with this,\" said Deli. \"What you have to do with this is take a law and manipulate it so you can get the indictment. This is the misconduct of the Public Prosecutor &apos; s Office, whether you are Republican or democratic.\" We wanted to look at the Special Prosecutor &apos; s political relations, where Crowley and Delay appeared on different pages. The Special Prosecutor, who has not been identified on the air, is the lawyer of San Antonio Michael McCroom. A grand jury accused Perry on the basis of the charges made by Makroom that Perry had abused his authority, after Perry had threatened to reverse the Attorney General &apos; s budget in Austin if she had not yet resigned on tape. Our partners in Polyte Fact Texas presented the legal history of the case against Perry, and noted how the prosecutor, Limburg, withdrew from the case, and the public integrity unit she led was not involved in the Makroom selection. Judge Bert Richardson McCroom, a Republican candidate from President George W. Bush, was selected. Richardson and McCorm both worked as plaintiffs in San Antonio, according to Texas Tribune. McCroom was recorded in the press accounts and didn't respond to our request for an interview. He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. By Bill McCarthy: January 12, 2021 Solomon Weisenberg, former Texas Attorney General, who worked with McCorm and considers him an \"old friend.\" Mike's not gonna be involved in a witch political chase. Weisenberg said that the idea that his political motives were ridiculous. \"I don't really consider him a political person.\" Records show that McCorm got away from the party, even when he attracted support from both sides of the corridor for 25 years. In 1989, McCroom served as Federal Attorney General in the western region of Texas, according to his curriculum vitae. In 2000, Makrom opened his own practice in San Antonio, with a focus on criminal defence. In 2009, President Barack Obama McRae was nominated as United States attorney in San Antonio, according to Texas Tribune. His candidacy was named a \"compromise choice\" by the Main Commercial Justice Journal, and the Republican embryos. John Cornen, Kay Billy Hutchison and House Democratic supported McCorm for this job. However, McCroom withdrew his name in 2010, because the lengthy nomination process disrupted his practice of law, according to the Wall Street Journal. The White House made no comment. It appears that Makrum did not vote in the pre-elections and had donated candidates from both parties. In 2007, he contributed $300 to a Republican candidate from the Fourth Court of Appeal, $500 to a former member of the Democratic Congress, and $500 to re-elect Bert Richardson as a unsuccessful Republican judge. This two-party record is neither unusual nor undesirable in private prosecutors, as Weisenberg said, who considers himself to be a governor and opposes the trial against Delay. He noted that Special Prosecutor Ken Starr, famous for the investigation of President Bill Clinton, also had links to both parties, and that Deli did not oppose him. The Governor Dlay said that it was \"untrue\" that Makram was not democratic, saying, \"He has relations with Obama, and he has relations with Democrats.\" McCorm has loose relations with Obama and Democrats -- and he has Republicans as well. News reports and McCroom's political record show that he is not explicitly biased, as he contributes a few hundred dollars to a few people on both sides of the corridor. There's a part of the truth in Delay's statement, but he ignores the critical facts that give a different impression. We mostly rate it wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07363"}
