These groups often are unbound by campaign finance restrictions, and can accept contributions from anonymous donors.\n\nOhio Democratic Party Chairman Chris Redfern recently highlighted outside money spent to attack Brown. At a July 10 news conference, Redfern claimed that $10.5 million in outside money has been spent against Brown, the Democratic incumbent, often with misleading ads.\n\nThe Ohio Republican Party fought back of behalf of Mandel, the Ohio treasurer. Spokeswoman Izzy Santa emailed the following:\n\n\"Sherrod Brown and his special interest allies in Washington are plotting to spend over $13 million, with no end in sight.\"\n\nThe feisty exchange prompted PolitiFact Ohio to dig deeper, since outside spending has been an issue in this Senate race.\n\nWe note here that the context in which the GOP claim was made was a discussion about money from outside special interest groups and Redfern\u2019s criticism that more than $10.5 million had flowed into the state on behalf of Mandel.\n\nJustin Barasky, a spokesman for Brown\u2019s campaign, said the GOP\u2019s comparison included more than $10 million worth of ad buys purchased by Brown\u2019s campaign and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, both of which must publicly report their donors and do not qualify as \"outside spending.\"\n\nSo before further analyzing the Ohio GOP\u2019s claim, we should provide a more clear definition of outside spending.\n\nRichard Briffault, a law professor at Columbia Law School professor who specializes in campaign finance, said there are two schools of thought.\n\n\"Some people divide the campaign finance world into parts \u2013 candidate spending and everything else (\u2018outside spending\u2019),\" Briffault wrote in an e-mail. \"Other people divide the campaign finance world into three parts \u2013 campaign spending, party spending in support of that party\u2019s candidates, and spending by all other groups (\u2018outside spending\u2019).\n\n\"I put myself in the second group,\" Briffault continued. \"Political parties are officially a part of the electoral process. Legislatures are organized by party, candidates are nominated by political parties and they run on party lines\u2026 in addition, federal campaign finance law permits party campaign committees to officially coordinate a certain amount of spending with candidates.\"\n\nTo sum up, Briffault\u2019s definition of outside spending would exclude candidate committees and party campaign committees, which must disclose their donors. Organizations such as super PACs and unions, however, would be considered outside spending. Those groups are not covered by the same regulations and do not face the same requirements for disclosure.\n\nWith that established, let\u2019s move back to the Ohio GOP\u2019s claim.\n\nWe asked Santa for evidence, and she provided the following list of expenditures or planned expenditures: $5.9 million by Brown\u2019s campaign; $5.1 million by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee; $1.1 million by Majority PAC; $775,167 by Service Employees International Union; and $500,000 by the League of Conservation Voters. Santa also mentioned two outside groups that bought radio airtime to thank Brown, but she did not have any exact figures for those buys.\n\nThose figures total $13.4 million, meaning the Ohio GOP has identified enough funding sources to support the amount of spending it claimed. Brown\u2019s campaign confirmed the figures are accurate.\n\nBut the GOP\u2019s list also supports the counterclaim from Brown\u2019s camp that most of the spending was done by his campaign and the DSCC, and not by outside groups or special interests. Of the more than $13 million, Brown\u2019s campaign and the DSCC accounted for about $11 million.\n\nBriffault, the Columbia law professor, said he would not consider spending by the DSCC or Brown\u2019s campaign as outside spending.\n\nThat would leave about $2.4 million in outside spending on Brown\u2019s behalf, a figure Brown\u2019s campaign does not dispute.\n\nSo where does that leave us with the Ohio GOP\u2019s statement?\n\nSanta, the Ohio GOP spokeswoman, said \"Brown and his special interest allies\" were planning to spend more than $13 million to defeat Mandel.\n\nThe claim is literally true because it includes both Brown and his allies. But the context in which it was made is important, too. The dispute between the campaigns revolved around outside money, and Santa\u2019s email, in fact, focused on outside money:\n\n\"Redfern is the least credible person to be commenting on outside spending when it comes to Ohio\u2019s U.S. Senate race. Sherrod Brown and his special interest allies in Washington are plotting to spend over $13 million, with no end in sight. It\u2019s clear that Brown and his supporters are having to spend this type of money because Brown\u2019s out-of-touch record has exposed him to Ohioans as a 38-year politician and Washington insider who puts politics over people.\"\n\nSanta said her $13 million figure is accurate because it was meant to include spending from all the players contributing to Brown\u2019s re-election, not just outside money. But the conversation, which began with Redfern\u2019s criticism of $10.5 million in outside spending tied to Mandel, was clearly focused on outside spending and not overall spending.\n\n(To keep Redfern honest, we asked the Ohio Democratic Party for the funding sources Redfern was talking about. The list included the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, American Crossroads and other groups. Neither Mandel\u2019s campaign nor the National Republican Senatorial Committee \u2013 the GOP equivalent of the DSCC \u2013 were on the list.)\n\nThose details are important to know to be able to put the Ohio Republican Party\u2019s claim in context.\n\nOn the Truth-O-Meter, the claim rates Half True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10742"}
