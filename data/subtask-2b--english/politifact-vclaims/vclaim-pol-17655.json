Presidents have the power to address drug pricing without congressional help", "text": "On the presidential primary campaign trail in Iowa, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.,\u00a0brought out a favorite talking point: ways the president can bring down drug prices without waiting for Congress.\nIt\u2019s not the first time Warren and other candidates have referenced this alleged power. In this case, she pointed to insulin, EpiPens and HIV/AIDS drugs as possible targets.\nWe asked the Warren campaign for the basis of her claim and they directed us to her \"Medicare for All\" transition plan. It identifies two legal mechanisms \u2015 \"compulsory licensing\" as outlined in 28 U.S. Code Section 1498 and the so-called march-in rights provision of the 1980 Bayh-Dole Act.\nWe spoke to legal and pharmaceutical policy experts about whether those mechanisms could be used to bring down drug prices, as Warren described. The answer? Yes. But it\u2019s complicated and controversial.\nThe legal mechanisms\nOf the two legal levers, Section 1498 is perhaps more straightforward.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe law says the government can intervene to take over patents without a company\u2019s permission, if the price is too high. The government can then create competition to bring down prices by importing those products from abroad, or manufacturing them. The original manufacturer can sue for damages but cannot stop Washington from breaking the patent.\n\"What they would do is announce they are taking other bids from other companies to supply the product\" to government programs such as Medicare, said Aaron Kesselheim, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School who researches drug pricing laws and has written extensively about Section 1498.\nThe provision has been used before \u2015 in the 1960s to procure cheap generic drugs \u2015 and was invoked as recently as 2001, as a threat to get a better price on Ciprofloxacin, a high-powered antibiotic used to treat anthrax. It also was used in 2014 in non-pharmaceutical contexts, such as by the Defense Department to acquire lead-free bullets.\nInvoking this part of the U.S. code wouldn\u2019t necessarily apply to all drugs, said Jacob Sherkow, a professor at New York Law School. But products such as the ones Warren mentioned \u2015 insulin and EpiPens, for instance, which are patented in the United States and abroad, and cost far less in other countries \u2015 would qualify. And that could send a message to other drug manufacturers.\n\"If you\u2019re a particularly aggressive president, you can find some low-hanging fruit, and use 1498 to show other pharmaceutical companies you\u2019re damn serious,\" Sherkow said.\nThere are other caveats. Sherkow noted that licensing a competing drug is only part of the equation; competition often brings down drug prices, but not always. In addition, not all drugs have equivalent patents here and abroad, which complicates importation. But many of the technical obstacles are surmountable, argued Amy Kapczynski, a professor at Yale Law School.\nThe march-in rights authority a little trickier. Bayh-Dole, the law that created march-in rights, suggests the government can \"march in\" when a drug isn\u2019t available amid concerns over public health, such as an epidemic. It applies only to pharmaceuticals for which the government holds all the patents because it funded the research that led to their development. An example could be Truvada for PrEP, the HIV prevention pill, Kesselheim said.\nUnlike Section 1498, march-in rights have\u00a0 never been used to negotiate a lower price \u2015 despite multiple petitions to the National Institutes of Health, the federal agency that would approve and oversee the process.\nThe question is whether high prices can constitute both a barrier and a public health concern having rendered\u00a0 a drug unavailable. Sherkow, for one, expressed skepticism.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNIH has historically opted against making this determination. For one, its directors have typically argued that cost isn\u2019t within their area of expertise. And, for another, they have suggested that \"marching in\" would discourage pharmaceutical companies from using government-funded research \u2015 ultimately leading to fewer breakthrough drugs being developed.\n\"That is a matter of culture, and I think a president could alter that perspective,\" Kesselheim said.\nDoing so, though, would require political capital. Even though Congress isn\u2019t required to vote on the matter, the president would have to, for instance, appoint officials willing to change the NIH perspective \u2015 and those leaders do require Senate confirmation. \"You\u2019d probably have to defend it in court,\" Kesselheim added.\nFinally, these mechanisms would also draw sharp pushback from the pharmaceutical industry. Given the fervor over the drug pricing debate, neither Section 1498 nor march-in rights should be used ubiquitously, Kesselheim said.\n\"It is a complicated enough and politically charged enough procedure, that it\u2019s something that should be reserved as a safety net for real public health emergencies,\" he said. \"I think Sen. Warren is identifying some of those cases.\"\nThey\u2019re all talking about it\nWarren\u2019s proposals are part of a larger pattern \u2015 Democratic presidential candidates including Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg \u2015 have talked about ways to bring down drug prices without congressional action.\nMinnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar also referenced such action during the January presidential primary debate.\n\"I have a plan of 137 things I found that a president can do herself in the first 100 days without Congress that are legal. And one of those things is that you can start bringing in less expensive drugs from other parties,\" she said.\u00a0\nAccording to Klobuchar\u2019s campaign, she was referring to a list she published on Medium in June 2019 in which she wrote that she would use \"existing Food and Drug Administration authority to grant a waiver that allows people to import safe prescription drugs for personal use from countries like Canada to decrease drug costs for seniors and all Americans.\"\nSherkow said this is indeed another example. Section 804 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act authorizes the HHS secretary to order the importation of specific drugs if it would impose no additional risk to the public\u2019s health and safety and would result in a significant cost reduction. But this example also highlights the complexities involved and why it is not necessarily fast or easy.\u00a0\u00a0\nHe pointed out that the president would have to nominate a candidate for secretary, get that person confirmed, then have the secretary make this order in respect to specific drugs, certify that the drugs are safe and would result in cost reduction \u2015 then have the importation take place.\u00a0\n\"Kudos to anyone for trying that in the first 100 days,\" Sherkow said.\u00a0\u00a0\nOur ruling\nWarren said, \"\"The president of the United States already has the legal authority to reduce the price of many commonly used prescription drugs.\" Multiple presidential candidates have talked about ways to bring down drug prices without new legislation.\nWe focused on Warren\u2019s argument: that the president already has this legal authority for many drugs, and that the power stems from Section 1498 and the march-in rights provision of a 1980 law. On these points, she is on firm ground.y\nLegal experts agreed that laws on the books do, in some cases, give the president that executive power \u2015 and the cases Warren outlined are viable candidates, especially for \"compulsory licensing.\" The same experts also pointed out that even with this authority, the politics and logistics could be tricky, and that using these mechanisms wouldn\u2019t address the entire drug pricing issue.\nWe rate this statement True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17655"}
