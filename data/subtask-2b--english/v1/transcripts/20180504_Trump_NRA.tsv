0062	Donald Trump	We love our country, and we believe our citizens deserve a government that shows them the same love and loyalty in return.
0063	Donald Trump	For the last 15 months, that is exactly what we have been doing.
0064	Donald Trump	We are all finally putting America first.
0065	Donald Trump	And we are seeing the incredible results as a result of our massive tax cuts, and everybody is benefiting and everybody is happy.

0072	Donald Trump	Don't be complacent.
0073	Donald Trump	Now, history says that when you win the presidency you get complacent.
0074	Donald Trump	We all know the feeling.
0075	Donald Trump	Do you know the feeling?
0076	Donald Trump	Not too many.
0077	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
0078	Donald Trump	Like, 90 percent of the time, you win the presidency and, for whatever reason, you lose the midterm.
0079	Donald Trump	We can't let that happen.
0080	Donald Trump	And the word is complacent.
0081	Donald Trump	You know, I kept thinking to myself, Why is that?
0082	Donald Trump	I wonder why.
0083	Donald Trump	Think about it.
0084	Donald Trump	You win.
0085	Donald Trump	You have this great win.
0086	Donald Trump	Now, you take a breath.
0087	Donald Trump	You relax.
0088	Donald Trump	All of a sudden, two years is up.
0089	Donald Trump	They're fighting like hell, and you're complacent.
0090	Donald Trump	We cannot get complacent.
0091	Donald Trump	We have to win the midterms.
0092	Donald Trump	Because since the election, we've created 3.2 million jobs, unthoughtof.
0093	Donald Trump	If we would have said that three years ago, during the campaign, people would have said, What a horrible exaggeration.
0094	Donald Trump	That's so terrible.
0095	Donald Trump	They wouldn't have believed it.
0096	Donald Trump	Threepointtwo million.
0097	Donald Trump	The unemployment rate  you saw that just today  just fell beneath four percent for the first time since the beginning of this century.
0098	Donald Trump	You know, I heard it was about 19 years.
0099	Donald Trump	I said, Wait a minute.
0100	Donald Trump	'The beginning of the century' sounds better.
0101	Donald Trump	So I say, The beginning of the century.
0102	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
0103	Donald Trump	More beautiful.
0104	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
0105	Donald Trump	AfricanAmerican unemployment has reached another alltime, in history, record low  in history.
0106	Donald Trump	And by the way, Kanye West must have some power because you probably saw, I doubled my AfricanAmerican poll numbers.
0107	Donald Trump	We went from 11 to 22 in one week.
0108	Donald Trump	Thank you, Kanye, thank you.
0109	Donald Trump	When I saw the number, I said, That must be a mistake.
0110	Donald Trump	How can that happen?
0111	Donald Trump	Even the pollsters thought there must be a mistake.
0112	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
0113	Donald Trump	No.
0114	Donald Trump	We've come a long way.
0115	Donald Trump	You remember, I'd come into big rooms, big audiences, and I'd say, What do you have to lose?
0116	Donald Trump	Because the Democrats have always had that vote.
0117	Donald Trump	I said, What do you have to lose?
0118	Donald Trump	Horrible on crime, horrible on education, horrible on education.
0119	Donald Trump	I'd say, What do you have to lose?
0120	Donald Trump	And they voted for me, and we won.
0121	Donald Trump	But now the numbers are much higher than they ever were with AfricanAmerican.
0122	Donald Trump	And we're happy.
0123	Donald Trump	And the same thing with Hispanic American unemployment, which is also at the lowest level in history  unemployment, lowest level in history.
0124	Donald Trump	And women's unemployment  women, many women  is at the lowest level in almost 20 years.
0125	Donald Trump	Think of that.
0126	Donald Trump	So we have the best employment numbers we've virtually ever had.
0127	Donald Trump	And yet all we hear about is this phony Russia witch hunt.
0128	Donald Trump	That's all we hear about, isn't it?
0129	SYSTEM	[Audience Boos]
0130	Donald Trump	So just when I'm walking on the stage, a highly respected judge in Virginia made statements.
0131	Donald Trump	It says  Wall Street Journal  it says, Judge Questions Mueller's Authority to Prosecute Manafort.
0132	Donald Trump	Now, Paul Manafort's a nice guy, but you know, he worked for me for a very short period of time  literally, for like, what?
0133	Donald Trump	A couple of months?
0134	Donald Trump	Little period of time.
0135	Donald Trump	Then what happens?
0136	Donald Trump	He worked for Ronald Reagan.
0137	Donald Trump	He worked for Bob Dole.
0138	Donald Trump	They worked, I think, as a firm, for John McCain.
0139	Donald Trump	They worked for others.
0140	Donald Trump	Does anybody say that?
0141	Donald Trump	No.
0142	Donald Trump	But he's out there fighting. On fake news CNN...
0143	SYSTEM	[Audience Boos]
0144	Donald Trump	I think NBC may be more distorted and worse, but  No, but on CNN, they have a headline Judge in Manafort Case Says Mueller's Aim is to Hurt Trump.
0145	Donald Trump	Do you believe that?
0146	Donald Trump	This is what we're up  It's called the witch hunt.
0147	Donald Trump	So I just said, Give me that article.
0148	Donald Trump	I want to read it.
0149	Donald Trump	Just happened a few minutes before I walked onstage.
0150	Donald Trump	A federal judge Friday questioned Special Counsel Robert Mueller's authority to bring tax and bank fraud charges unrelated  unrelated.
0151	Donald Trump	Nobody knows that.
0152	Donald Trump	Everyone thinks, Oh...
0153	Donald Trump	Unrelated to the 2016 election against former Trump campaign manager chairman Paul Manafort.
0154	Donald Trump	He was there for a short while.
0155	Donald Trump	But he's a good person.
0156	Donald Trump	He is.
0157	Donald Trump	I really believe he's a good person.
0158	Donald Trump	Judge T.S.
0159	Donald Trump	Ellis...  who is really something very special, I hear, from many standpoints.
0160	Donald Trump	He's a respected person.
0161	Donald Trump	...suggested the charges before the U.S. district court for the Eastern District of Virginia were just part of the Mueller team's designs to pressure Mr. Manafort into giving up information on President Donald Trump or others in the campaign.
0162	Donald Trump	I've been saying that for a long time.
0163	Donald Trump	It's a witch hunt.
0164	Donald Trump	Then, none of that information has to do with information related to the Russian government coordination and the campaign of Donald Trump.
0165	Donald Trump	It doesn't have anything to do.
0166	Donald Trump	It's from years before.
0167	Donald Trump	Then, How does this have anything to do with the campaign, the judge asks.
0168	Donald Trump	Let me tell you, folks, we're all fighting battles, but I love fighting these battles.
0169	Donald Trump	It's really a disgrace.
0170	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]
0171	Donald Trump	Thank you.
0172	Donald Trump	Thank you.
0173	Donald Trump	Can you imagine, if we ever called for a rally in Washington, D.C.?
0174	Donald Trump	There wouldn't be enough room.
0175	Donald Trump	There wouldn't be enough room.
0176	Donald Trump	We have a lot of love going on.
0177	Donald Trump	You know, people don't realize, we have great love going on in this country, great love.
0178	Donald Trump	It's right here.
0179	Donald Trump	We have...
0180	Donald Trump	And  and by the way, you just saw the recent poll?
0181	Donald Trump	It came out, the Rasmussen, 51 or 52.
0182	Donald Trump	It's the highest level I've ever been at.
0183	Donald Trump	How does that happen when you only get bad publicity?
0184	Donald Trump	How does that happen?
0185	Donald Trump	That's because people realize  That's because people realize that a lot of what you read, and a lot of what you see on television is fake.
0186	Donald Trump	They realize it.
0187	Donald Trump	The people are smart.
0188	Donald Trump	The people are smart.
0189	Donald Trump	So you have a battle also.
0190	Donald Trump	You have a battle to keep your rights, and we're going to keep those rights.
0191	Donald Trump	You're going to be so happy.
0192	Donald Trump	You have to say.
0193	Donald Trump	You weren't sure that Trump was going to win, but you all went out there.
0194	Donald Trump	You all went out there, and you voted.
0195	Donald Trump	You voted.
0196	Donald Trump	And there were times they put up that Trump, Pence, Trump, Pence.
0197	Donald Trump	There were times you say  a week before they were saying  I remember they came out with a lot of phony polls.
0198	Donald Trump	You know that that's called?
0199	Donald Trump	Suppression.
0200	Donald Trump	They convince you that you're wasting your time.
0201	Donald Trump	Why should you vote?
0202	Donald Trump	Go to a movie instead.
0203	Donald Trump	Come home watch the results.
0204	Donald Trump	Very few of the people in this room and in this country did that.
0205	Donald Trump	And we really had a big night.
0206	Donald Trump	Remember they said there is no way, Electoral College, there is no way to 270 for me.
0207	Donald Trump	There is no way to 270 and they were right.
0208	Donald Trump	But 306 was OK.
0209	Donald Trump	Crazy.
0210	Donald Trump	306.
0211	Donald Trump	So, we had a great time and I think we're doing better now than ever before.
0212	Donald Trump	I think we're more popular now from the standpoint, now we've produced.
0213	Donald Trump	You know, when I was running I said we're going to give you tax cuts and by the way, we are decimating Obamacare.
0214	Donald Trump	We got a bad vote the evening.
0215	Donald Trump	We got a bad vote the evening that we were going to terminate Obamacare.
0216	Donald Trump	We got a bad vote.
0217	Donald Trump	You know about that, right.
0218	Donald Trump	That was not a nice thing.
0219	Donald Trump	That was an unexpected vote.
0220	Donald Trump	But if you look at the massive tax cut bill we also got rid of the individual mandate which is the worse part of Obamacare, right.
0221	Donald Trump	I don't know if the people in Texas are going to like this but we also got ANWR in Alaska.
0222	Donald Trump	So I don't know if you're going to like a little competition, but you know what it is?
0223	Donald Trump	It's called energy for this country.
0224	Donald Trump	It's called energy.
0225	Donald Trump	That we like.
0226	Donald Trump	So, Ted, I think you're happy with that.
0227	Donald Trump	I think, right?
0228	Donald Trump	So, we've delivered and when we were running I would say we're going to this, we're going to that, we're going to that.
0229	Donald Trump	A certain person that's not a very fair person in the media said I have to say Trump has actually delivered more than he promised which is probably the first time people have ever heard that statement.
0230	Donald Trump	We actually delivered more than we promised and let me just tell you this, we're really doing well with North Korea.
0231	Donald Trump	We're really doing well.
0232	Donald Trump	Right.
0233	Donald Trump	We're doing real well.
0234	Donald Trump	Remember they said it's going to be terrible.
0235	Donald Trump	They were actually saying three months ago when the rhetoric was rather sharp, do we agree?
0236	Donald Trump	I won't use the rhetoric now.
0237	Donald Trump	Now, I'm trying to calm it down a little bit.
0238	Donald Trump	So, I'm not going to use the rhetoric.
0239	Donald Trump	But let's put it this way  he goes use it.
0240	Donald Trump	I know you come from Texas whoever the hell you are.
0241	Donald Trump	Look for years  for years they've had this problem, and everybody has said, don't talk, don't talk.
0242	Donald Trump	Don't  please don't talk.
0243	Donald Trump	The last administration had a policy of silence.
0244	Donald Trump	Don't talk.

0250	Donald Trump	Same thing with Iran, remember?
0251	Donald Trump	We're signing that horrible deal and they're marching in the streets, saying Death to America.
0252	Donald Trump	I said, Who signs a deal when they're marching, saying 'Death to America'?
0253	Donald Trump	Who marches?
0254	Donald Trump	They're saying Death to America, and we have the former administration, as  as represented by John Kerry  not the best negotiator we've ever seen  he never walked away from the table, except to be in that bicycle race, where he fell and broke his leg.
0255	Donald Trump	That's it.
0256	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
0257	Donald Trump	That was the only time.
0258	Donald Trump	I said, Don't tell them you broke your leg.

0260	Donald Trump	You'll make a much better deal.
0261	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
0262	Donald Trump	But he broke his leg.

0264	Donald Trump	At 73 years old, you never go into a bicycle race, OK?
0265	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
0266	Donald Trump	Just  you just don't do that.
0267	Donald Trump	I'm not 73 he was, OK? Just...
0268	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
0269	Donald Trump	... but I'll be there.
0270	Donald Trump	But we have great things going on.
0271	Donald Trump	And, you know, with respect to North Korea, remember how strong it was?
0272	Donald Trump	And they were saying, This is going to be nuclear war?
0273	Donald Trump	We're going to have  no.
0274	Donald Trump	You know what gets you nuclear war?
0275	Donald Trump	Weakness gets you nuclear war.
0276	Donald Trump	Being weak gets you nuclear war.
0277	Donald Trump	That's what gets you nuclear war.
0278	Donald Trump	So let's talk about guns, shall we?
0279	Donald Trump	Paris, France has the toughest gun laws in the world.
0280	Donald Trump	The president just left Washington  Emmanuel, great guy  nobody has guns in Paris, nobody.
0281	Donald Trump	And we all remember more than 130 people, plus tremendous numbers of people that were horribly, horribly wounded  you notice nobody ever talks about that?
0282	Donald Trump	They talk about the people that died, but they never mentioned that 250 people had horrible, horrible wounds.
0283	Donald Trump	I mean, they never mention that.
0284	Donald Trump	But they died in a restaurant and various other closeproximity places.
0285	Donald Trump	They were brutally killed by a small group of terrorists that had guns.
0286	Donald Trump	They took their time and gunned them down one by one  boom, come over here, boom, come over here, boom.
0287	Donald Trump	If you were in those rooms, one of those people  and the survivors said it just lasted forever.
0288	Donald Trump	But, if one employee or just one patron had a gun, or if one person in this room had been there with a gun, aimed at the opposite direction, the terrorists would have fled or been shot.
0289	Donald Trump	And it would have been a whole different story.
0290	Donald Trump	I mean, right?
0291	Donald Trump	Right?
0292	Donald Trump	We all know what's going on in Chicago.
0293	Donald Trump	But Chicago has the toughest gun laws in our country.
0294	Donald Trump	They're so tough.
0295	Donald Trump	But you know what's happening? It seems that, if we're going to outlaw guns, like so many people want to doDemocrats...

0298	Donald Trump	Then we will getand you know what I'm going to say.
0299	Donald Trump	We are going to have to outlaw, immediately, all vans and all trucks, which are now the new form of death for the maniac terrorists.
0300	Donald Trump	Right?
0301	Donald Trump	They take a truck, and they run over 8 people and wound 16, like what happened in New York and what just happened.
0302	Donald Trump	It's happening all over.
0303	Donald Trump	So let's ban, immediately, all trucks, all vans, maybe all cars.

0311	Donald Trump	Yes, that's right.
0312	Donald Trump	They don't have guns.
0313	Donald Trump	They have knives.
0314	Donald Trump	And, instead, there's blood all over the floors of this hospital.
0315	Donald Trump	They say it's as bad as a military warzone hospital.
0316	Donald Trump	Knives, knives, knivesLondon hasn't been used to that.
0317	Donald Trump	They're getting used to it.
0318	Donald Trump	It's pretty tough.
0319	Donald Trump	We're here today because we recognize a simple fact The one thing that has always stood between the American people and the elimination of our Second Amendment rights has been conservatives in Congress willing to fight for those rights.
0320	Donald Trump	And we're fighting.
0321	Donald Trump	We're fighting.
0322	Donald Trump	We're fighting to defend our freedom.
0323	Donald Trump	We need the people in Washington to support our freedom, to support our candidates, to support Ted, to support the people that have to raise their hand.
0324	Donald Trump	You know, they say we have a majority.
0325	Donald Trump	We have what?
0326	Donald Trump	A majority of one personthat's not really a majority.
0327	Donald Trump	We need Republicans to do it right.
0328	Donald Trump	To get the kind of things we want, we've got to get Republicans elected.
0329	Donald Trump	We've got to do great in '18.
0330	Donald Trump	Those midtermswe have to do them.
0331	Donald Trump	We need judges who will enforce our laws, protect our sovereignty and uphold our American way of life.
0332	Donald Trump	The Constitution can't be changed by judges, bureaucrats or the United Nations.
0333	Donald Trump	That is why we are appointing federal judges who will interpret the law as written.
0334	Donald Trump	In my first year, I nominated, and the Senate confirmed, more circuit judges than any new administration, by far, in history.
0335	Donald Trump	And we will have the alltime record very soon.
0336	Donald Trump	President Obama was very nice to us, because he left us a lot of judges.
0337	Donald Trump	And I said, That's a lot of judgeslike, almost 140.
0338	Donald Trump	That's a lot of judges.
0339	Donald Trump	I was very surprised.
0340	Donald Trump	I was very happy.
0341	Donald Trump	And we put an incredible new justice on the Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch.
0342	Donald Trump	Yet virtually every single Democrat in the Senate opposed Neil Gorsuch, just like they have consistently opposed judges who will protect your basic freedoms.
0343	Donald Trump	And, by the way, the way they're slowwalking people that are supposed to be working for us in government... (BOOING)

0345	Donald Trump	And they can't get approved because every single one of them is being slowwalked by the Democrats, and it's never happened before.
0346	Donald Trump	And you know what?
0347	Donald Trump	I hope we have long memories, but I hope we don't have to worry about it because we're going to be there a long time.

0355	Donald Trump	My administration and conservatives in Congress were elected to uphold your rights.
0356	Donald Trump	To rebuild our military, which we are doing a great job of rebuilding.
0357	Donald Trump	To restore our prosperity, to secure our communities and defend our borders.
0358	Donald Trump	We have the worst immigration laws anywhere in the world.
0359	Donald Trump	But I'll tell you what.
0360	Donald Trump	It's not easy for people to come in.
0361	Donald Trump	I will tell you, it's notwe have the worst laws.
0362	Donald Trump	After years of defending the borders of other countrieswe go into wars with other countries.
0363	Donald Trump	We shouldn't be there.
0364	Donald Trump	We go into wars to defend their borders, we don't defend our own borders.
0365	Donald Trump	And we're going to start defending our country.
0366	Donald Trump	We're going to start defending our borders.
0367	Donald Trump	You've all seen, on television, all over the papers.
0368	Donald Trump	The illegal migrants, pouring up through Mexico, flooding the border.
0369	Donald Trump	Many from Central America Honduras, all over the place.
0370	Donald Trump	Coming up by the thousands.
0371	Donald Trump	We're stopping them at different fronts.
0372	Donald Trump	But we don't have laws.
0373	Donald Trump	We have laws that were written by people that truly could not love our country.
0374	Donald Trump	Illegal immigration must end.
0375	Donald Trump	Illegal immigration must end.
0376	Donald Trump	We are going to have strong borders.
0377	Donald Trump	I will tell you, we have maxed out every law.
0378	Donald Trump	We are going to have truly strongand we're going to take people into our country, but they're going to come in based on merit, not based on picking somebody out of a bin.
0379	Donald Trump	We are not going to let our country be overwhelmed, and we're going to demand Congress secure the border in the upcoming C.R.
0380	Donald Trump	It's going to be very soon, going to be very soon.
0381	Donald Trump	In recent months, Democratic lawmakers have voted against legislation to close deadly immigration loopholes, like catchandrelease.
0382	Donald Trump	How about that one?
0383	Donald Trump	We caught him.
0384	Donald Trump	Oh.
0385	Donald Trump	Release him.
0386	Donald Trump	Byebye.
0387	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
0388	Donald Trump	Welcome to America.
0389	Donald Trump	Welcome to America.
0390	Donald Trump	That's what we have.
0391	Donald Trump	We're going to keep the violent criminals out.
0392	Donald Trump	Sentae Democrats like Jon Testeryou saw what happened there.
0393	Donald Trump	What he did to one of the finest people in our country.
0394	Donald Trump	What he did to the admiralwhat he did is a disgrace.
0395	Donald Trump	Jon Tester.
0396	Donald Trump	Bill Nelson and Bob Casey voted against Kate's Law, legislation named for Kate Steinle, who was gunned down by a fivetime deported illegal immigrant, and you saw what happened with that court case.
0397	Donald Trump	Can you believe the result of that court case?
0398	Donald Trump	Can you believe that?
0399	Donald Trump	The same senators, along with nearly every other Democrat, also voted to protect something that's actually becoming very unpopular, sanctuary cities.
0400	Donald Trump	Can you believe, finally, people are starting to get it.
0401	SYSTEM	(BOOING)
0402	Donald Trump	Democrats and liberals in Congress want to disarm lawabiding Americans at the same time they're releasing dangerous criminal aliens and savage gang members onto our streets.
0403	Donald Trump	These countries send up their worst.
0404	Donald Trump	Remember when my opening speechI got criticized for it, remember?
0405	Donald Trump	Well, guess what.
0406	Donald Trump	They're not sending their finest, that I can tell you.
0407	Donald Trump	We're getting some real beauties in here.
0408	Donald Trump	But we're taking MS13, horrible killer gang members, we're getting them out, because our guys are much tougher than theirs.
0409	Donald Trump	There is not even a little bit of a contest.
0410	Donald Trump	And that's the only language they understand.
0411	Donald Trump	That's the only language they understand.
0412	Donald Trump	These are savage killers.
0413	Donald Trump	My administration believes our cities should be safe havens for Americans, not sanctuaries for criminals.
0414	Donald Trump	And we believe that violent gang members must be thrown out of our country immediately, not let to stay, to fester, and to get larger.
0415	Donald Trump	We get 'em out, and we are kicking 'em out by thousands.
0416	Donald Trump	If we had the right lawswhich we can have very quickly with cooperationwe wouldn't even have a problem.
0417	Donald Trump	It would be so much better, so much easier.
0418	Donald Trump	We believe that politicians who put criminal aliens before American citizens should be voted out of office immediately.
0419	Donald Trump	As we secure our borders, we're also supporting the heroes who fight crime, serve our citizens, and secure our streets, our brave men and brave women in blue.
0420	Donald Trump	We love them.
0421	Donald Trump	In my administration, we have a simple policy.
0422	Donald Trump	We will protect those who protect us.
0423	Donald Trump	You saw what I did with the military equipment, the excess equipment that was sitting all over the country in warehouses, never to be used again.
0424	Donald Trump	And other administrations, they just didn't want to give it to the police.
0425	Donald Trump	They said it's too much protection, it looks too strong, it looks like military.
0426	Donald Trump	Guess what?
0427	Donald Trump	It's now being distributed all over to our police forces.
0428	Donald Trump	And it's better than they could ever buy.
0429	Donald Trump	You can't buy stuff like that.
0430	Donald Trump	Today, our love and prayers go out to the family of slain Dallas police officer Rogelio Santander, who last week was murdered in the line of duty very, very close to this arena.
0431	Donald Trump	We ask God to help the others who were wounded, and they will recover.
0432	Donald Trump	They will be better.
0433	Donald Trump	They will be back.
0434	Donald Trump	Send our love.
0435	Donald Trump	So important.
0436	Donald Trump	Thank you.
0437	Donald Trump	And we mourn together with the entire Dallas Police Department.
0438	Donald Trump	It's a great police department, a police force that has lost too many heroes, but has never lost its will to protect, and to serve you.
0439	Donald Trump	We're also taking very strong action to secure and protect our most valuable resource our children.
0440	Donald Trump	All of us here today are deeply committed to school safety.
0441	Donald Trump	Nothing is more important than protecting innocent lives.
0442	Donald Trump	And I will tell you, Wayne and Chris, and all of the people at the NRA, we speak about it all the time.
0443	Donald Trump	These are great people.
0444	Donald Trump	These are great Americans.
0445	Donald Trump	These people have great heart.
0446	Donald Trump	They know what they're doing.
0447	Donald Trump	Our entire nation was filled with shock and grief by the monstrous attack on a high school in Parkland, Florida.
0448	Donald Trump	We mourn for the victims and their families.
0449	Donald Trump	Gotten to know members of those families.
0450	Donald Trump	These are incredible people, and our hearts break for every American who has suffered the horrors of these school shootings.
0451	Donald Trump	In the aftermath of the terrible attack, I met with the survivors, the parents of school shooting victims at the White House.
0452	Donald Trump	I was inspired, like all of you were, by their incredible courage.
0453	Donald Trump	We agreed that it's not enough to simply take actions that make us feel like we're making a difference.
0454	Donald Trump	We must ensure that we actually make a difference, and my administration has pursued an aggressive strategy on community safety.
0455	Donald Trump	We're working to improve early warning systems so that when the police are called, when the community sees the red flagswhich they saw in Parkland all over the place.
0456	Donald Trump	There has never been a case where more red flags have been shownswift action is taken by the authorities.
0457	Donald Trump	Lawabiding gun owners want to keep firearms out of the hands of those who pose a danger to themselves and to others.
0458	Donald Trump	We all want that.
0459	Donald Trump	We all want that.
0460	Donald Trump	I recently signed legislation that includes more than $2 billion to improve school safety, including the funding for training, and metal detectors, and security, and mental health.
0461	Donald Trump	Mental health is a big one.
0462	Donald Trump	They don't like to talk about mental health.
0463	Donald Trump	Mental healththat was the number one example in Parkland.
0464	Donald Trump	That legislation also made vital improvements to our background check system, which everybody wants.
0465	Donald Trump	Finally, all of us agree that we must harden certain schools.
0466	Donald Trump	At the same time, the police have to be able to get into those schools if there's a problem.
0467	Donald Trump	We want armed guards.
0468	Donald Trump	We want to be able to get in.
0469	Donald Trump	I saw some of the craziest plans that I've ever seen.
0470	Donald Trump	You can spend a fortune on each school.
0471	Donald Trump	You will spend so muchnobody knows more about construction than I do.
0472	Donald Trump	You will spend so much, you're going to make it so hard that you can't run a D8  you know what that is, right?
0473	Donald Trump	 through the doors.
0474	Donald Trump	It means a tractor.
0475	Donald Trump	There's only one problem If one of these maniacs get in, and it's so hard, you can't get in.
0476	Donald Trump	So you have to be careful.
0477	Donald Trump	We strongly believe in allowing highly trained teachers to carry concealed weapons if they're highly trained.
0478	Donald Trump	And we want highly trained security guards.
0479	Donald Trump	Ninetyeight percent of mass public shootings have occurred in places where guns are banned, just so you understand.
0480	Donald Trump	Tragically, as we've seen, there's no sign more inviting to a mass killer than a sign that declares, This school is a gunfree zone.
0481	Donald Trump	Come in and take us.
0482	Donald Trump	Ninetyeight percent.
0483	Donald Trump	You know, they're cowards.
0484	Donald Trump	You saw that in the recent case, where he did all of his damage and then he sort of slinked out of the school.
0485	Donald Trump	And the policeman outside caught him in a different community.
0486	Donald Trump	That policeman did a good job.
0487	Donald Trump	That policeman did a good job.
0488	Donald Trump	Caught him in a different community.
0489	Donald Trump	But they are cowards.
0490	Donald Trump	When they know there's guns inside, they're not going in.
0491	Donald Trump	We just don't understand that.
0492	Donald Trump	We can't get that word out.
0493	Donald Trump	But highly trained people.
0494	Donald Trump	At the same time, there is no stronger deterrent for a sick individual than the knowledge that their attack will end their life and will end in total failure.
0495	Donald Trump	When they know that, they're not going in.
0496	Donald Trump	You're not going to have school attacks.
0497	Donald Trump	We support the Second Amendment.
0498	Donald Trump	Not only because we believe in freedom, but also because we trust in everyday, talented, wonderful people.
0499	Donald Trump	They love our students.
0500	Donald Trump	And by the way, these teachers, they love their students.
0501	Donald Trump	They love their students.
0502	Donald Trump	They understand and they love their students, and they're not going to let anybody hurt their students.
0503	Donald Trump	But you have to give them a chance.
0504	Donald Trump	In America, we trust the people to be wise and to be good.
0505	Donald Trump	We trust them to take responsibility for themselves, their families and their communities.
0506	Donald Trump	And that is why, in America, we have always trusted the people to keep and bear arms.
0507	Donald Trump	It is fitting that we gather today in the great state of Texas, a place that cherishes their right like no other.
0508	Donald Trump	You know, before I left today, a couple of people came up to me.
0509	Donald Trump	Good political people.
0510	Donald Trump	They said, You know, going to the NRA convention and speaking today, that'll be very controversial.
0511	Donald Trump	It might not be popular.
0512	Donald Trump	You know what I said?
0513	Donald Trump	Byebye, got to get on the plane.
0514	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
0515	Donald Trump	Because we have to do the right thing.
0516	Donald Trump	We have to do the right thing.
0517	Donald Trump	This proud state would not exist if not for a handful of determined and defiant Texans who refused to surrender their rights nearly two centuries ago.
0518	Donald Trump	Right?
0519	Donald Trump	You know who I'm talking about.
0520	Donald Trump	You know who I'm talking about.
0521	Donald Trump	In 1835, soldiers from General Santa Ana's army marched into the little Texas town of Gonzales, and ordered those settlers to surrender their small canon they relied on to protect their lives, and protect their homes.
0522	Donald Trump	The Texans refused.
0523	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]
0524	Donald Trump	That's right.
0525	Donald Trump	They were not about to give up their only means of self defense.
0526	Donald Trump	In response, Santa Ana's army returned with a large group of additional people.
0527	Donald Trump	They had men all over the place.
0528	Donald Trump	The army was big.
0529	Donald Trump	This time, they were met by dozens of Texans, settlers, soldiers and ordinary citizens who had rushed to Gonzales to defend their rights and their freedom.
0530	Donald Trump	As Santa Ana's men watched from a distance, those brave Texans raised a flag for all to see, and you know what it said.
0531	Donald Trump	On the banner, they painted a canon, along with four words that echoed through the ages, and you know what it is.
0532	Donald Trump	It said, Come and take it.
0533	Donald Trump	Come and take it.
0534	SYSTEM	[Audience Chants USA]
0535	Donald Trump	Like those early Texans, Americans will never surrender, ever, ever, ever.
0536	Donald Trump	We will never, never surrender.
0537	Donald Trump	We will never give up our freedom.
0538	Donald Trump	Americans are born free.
0539	Donald Trump	We will live free, and we will die free.
0540	Donald Trump	So again, it is a great honor to be with you, very special people.
0541	Donald Trump	We truly appreciate your support.
0542	Donald Trump	I'm going the right thing.
0543	Donald Trump	I'm doing it for you, but we're doing the right thing.
0544	Donald Trump	We're doing the right thing together.
0545	Donald Trump	I want to thank again all of our friends and patriots from the NRA.
0546	Donald Trump	We will never fail, and we will always protect your Second Amendment.
0547	Donald Trump	Thank you.
0548	Donald Trump	God bless you, and God bless America.
0549	Donald Trump	Thank you all.
0550	Donald Trump	Thank you.
