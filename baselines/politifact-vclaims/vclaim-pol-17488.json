Josh Hawley, R-Mo., applauded the University of Missouri following its announcement that the university\u2019s Confucius Institute will shut down in August.\n\n\n\"Pleased Mizzou is shutting down the#China Communist Party funded \u2018Confucius Institute.\u2019 As the State Department warned Mizzou in July 2019, and as I have repeatedly stated, this program presented security risks for students & university as a whole,\"\u00a0Hawley tweeted\u00a0Jan. 15.\n\n\nHawley has criticized the Confucius Institute and raised questions about the program in the past, including when he sent a letter to MU Chancellor Alexander Cartwright on July 24 urging him to \"reconsider the costs and risks that come with allowing a Confucius Institute to remain on (Mizzou\u2019s) campus, and with entering any other agreements with the Chinese government.\"\n\n\nThat wasn\u2019t the first time a politician urged a university to shut down its Confucius Institute program citing threats to security;\u00a0Texas A&M closed its program\u00a0after two U.S. representatives wrote a letter recommending the action to four Texas universities.\n\n\nWe decided to look into whether the State Department really warned Mizzou in July about security risks arising from a Confucius Institute program. We found a letter, but struggled to find a warning.\n\n\nThe controversy\n\n\nMizzou\u2019s Confucius Institute\u00a0is one of about 500 established worldwide by Hanban, a subsidiary of the Chinese Ministry of Education.\u00a0Hanban\u2019s website\u00a0describes Confucius Institutes as nonprofit, public institutions that \"aim to promote Chinese language and culture in foreign countries.\"\u00a0\n\n\nHawley criticized Hanban in his letter to Cartwright, saying that it is governed by leaders of 12 Chinese ministries, including those that handle media and propaganda. He also said universities that partner with Hanban sign contracts that prohibit \"tarnishing the reputation\" of Hanban, and they send teachers and textbooks designed to promote a positive image of China.\n\n\nIn the United States and across the globe, universities have been shutting down their programs amid concerns and investigations. BBC News\u00a0reported in September 2019\u00a0that a \"flurry\" of universities worldwide had closed their programs in the preceding weeks.\u00a0\n\n\nMizzou announced on Jan. 14 that its contract with the Confucius Institute will be terminated, effective in August, according to a\u00a0news release from the university. The main reason: a change in State Department guidelines that now requires a certified Mandarin teacher to accompany classrooms with Confucius Institute staff members.\n\n\nThe Confucius Institute instructors were classified as interns on exchange visas, not teachers. The university said it would cost too much to make the changes in categories.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDOWNLOAD THE LETTER\n\n\n\nThe release says the State Department notified Mizzou in a July letter. Hawley\u2019s press secretary confirmed with us this is the same letter he was referring to in his tweet.\n\n\nSo, did the State Department warn Mizzou that the Confucius Institute presented security risks?\n\n\nMU spokesperson Christian Basi provided us the July 15 letter from the Department of State\u2019s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs. It was signed by Henry C. Scott, director of the Office of Private Sector Exchange Program Administration. There\u2019s no direct warning given by the State Department here. The letter was meant to notify Mizzou of violations in its Confucius Institute program that were found by the department and address how to fix them.\n\n\nThe letter states the exchange program administration attempts to help sponsors of a Confucius Institute program correct errors when the office notices them. It addressed specific areas of concern.\u00a0\n\n\nThe first area of concern was Confucius Institute student interns teaching in K-12 classrooms without a supervisor who speaks Mandarin. The language barrier \"creates a vulnerability, as efficacy of the co-teacher\u2019s supervision is severely limited,\" the letter states.\n\n\nIf that is a warning about security, it\u2019s pretty opaque.\u00a0\n\n\nThe other areas of concern listed were failures to comply with required form signatures and worker\u2019s compensation policies, improperly listing Confucius Institute student interns\u2019 primary site of activity and misusing a \"Research Scholar\" role defined by the department.\u00a0\n\n\nThere is no specific mention of potential risks to students or Mizzou in the letter.\u00a0\n\n\nOur ruling\n\n\nHawley said the State Department warned Mizzou that the Confucius Institute \"presented security risks for students & university as a whole.\"\n\n\nIn a July letter to the university, the State Department listed violations of its guidelines and offered instructions on how to fix those violations. The letter never warns the university about risks created by the Confucius Institute; there\u2019s little language that points to any warning. The closest it comes is in pointing out the risks of not adhering to the department guidelines on having a Mandaring speaker in the classroom, which \"creates a vulnerability.\"\n\n\nWe rate this claim Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17488"}
