Like a major tax reduction for America and the world. Have fun! $54, it was only $82. Thank you for Saudi Arabia, but let's go down! Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTromp) 21 November 2018 The tweet came a day after the President indicated that he would not go after Saudi Arabia to kill journalist Jamal Khashogji. Trump defected from the CIA, which concluded that Saudi Crown Prince Mohamed Bin Salman had ordered the assassination of Khashogji. We're wondering, how low is the price? How much of this can be attributed to Saudi Arabia's actions? The short answer is that both parts of the statement are exaggerated. (The White House did not respond to a query) According to the figures, there was a decline in gas prices, but the drop was less dramatic than that indicated by Trump. This is the case regardless of the measure used: average crude oil or the Brent standard in Western Texas, the two main criteria for crude oil prices per barrel. The last time it cost a barrel of oil was $82 in October 2014, according to federal data on average crude oil in Western Texas. The price was $76.40 in early October 2018, and the most recent data show that it amounted to $57.16. This is a decrease of $19.24, not what Trump said of $28. For the crude net, a barrel of oil reached US$ 86.07 in early October, and has since been reduced to US$ 64.14. This is a decrease of $21.93, which is also smaller than the Trump drop mentioned. In addition, the last price of Brent's crude brick is still $10 per barrel more than Trump's tweet. Here is how the prices have been traced since early September. However, despite the decline in recent weeks, the prices of the pump in the heavy Thanksgiving week are still the highest in four years. On January 13, 2021, the distinguished fact-finding bloggers announced in a story in which General David H. Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request to use marines for epithelial security, and told her that \"we are not working for you.\" Saudi Arabia is a major player in oil, and its production has recently increased. However, the recent increase in oil production in Saudi Arabia is not sufficient to explain the decline in oil prices. At first, Saudi Arabia is not as powerful in the world market as it was in the past. The United States oil production has seen a greater net increase than the total increase in production from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), of which Saudi Arabia is a part. Other countries have also increased their production, including Russia and the United Arab Emirates. Overall, this high level of production has had a significant impact on world markets. While Iran has reduced oil production in the light of United States sanctions, this has not affected supplies to the extent expected by some, as stated by Paul J. Sullivan, Professor of Economics at the Eisenhower School at the National Defence University. There is another factor on the demand side. Sullivan said that the main reason for this decline was the expectation of a slowdown in the world economy, leaving much oil and not enough customers. :: The International Energy Agency (IEA) has announced revised projections of this slow growth in global demand until 2019, which, as Anna Mikulska, a non-resident colleague at the Centre for Energy Studies at the Baker Institute, is playing with falling prices. In addition, the price of oil in dollars and the growing strength of the dollar made oil cheaper, as Sullivan said. Whatever was said, there were \"hundreds of other economic factors\" that played in oil prices outside Saudi Arabia, Sullivan said. \"That tweet may amount to 15-20% of the explanation, but it misses the other 80-85%.\" Mikulska agreed. \"Saudi Arabia's commitment to increasing production has been important in reducing oil prices since October, but it has not been the only factor.\" Our rule is that just before Thanksgiving, oil was $54 per barrel, down from $82. He added: \"Thank you to Saudi Arabia.\" The price of oil has fallen in recent weeks, and the increase in Saudi Arabia &apos; s production has played a role in this regard. However, oil prices did not fall as much as Tramp said, and several factors other than Saudi Arabia - including increased production by other major suppliers and a expected drop in demand - played an important role. We value the claim half right.
