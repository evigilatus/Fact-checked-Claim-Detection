Jim Justiss encouraged the West Virgins to buy a fishing license. In tweeting, offer an economic logic -- that fishing is an economic engine of the state. I wrote justice in November 5, \"I've said it before and I'll say it again, hunting is really something that can help our economy grow! Hunters contribute more than $500 million to our state each year and help support many jobs.

The Natural Resources Division of West Virginia sent a tweet on Nov 24, using the same dollar figure, adding that the deer hunters in particular \"spent an estimated $230 million in West Virginia, mostly in rural areas of the state.\" We were wondering, do you offer money, and the other game, really bring the country $500 million? When we contacted the Office of Justice, he was cited by Jordan Damron, Assistant Legal and Digital Adviser to the Governor, in the Natural Resources Department of West Virginia. A press release issued on 14 November by the Division contained $500 million and stated that \"fishing is estimated to be responsible for 5,400 jobs and $35 million in sales taxes on goods and services spent in West Virginia.\" The news says the numbers came from Southwick Associates, a research firm focused on foreign markets. The Southwick Associates report said that there was $421,819,113 in retail sales in West Virginia, with a \"multiple effect\" that increased to $233,552,085. The multiplier was used to estimate \"the total amount of expenditure that occurs in the economy as a result of fishermen's expenditures.\" On January 16, 2021, Jordan Rachel stated in Tweedda that the minimum wage of $15 per hour would raise the price of taco bill burrito to $38. \u2022 20 January 2021, the report also stated that 5,377 jobs had been created by fishing and that $35,544,522 in government and local taxes had been collected because of fishing. The amount spent on deer hunting alone was $291,972,745. Therefore, the figures cited by justice exist. However, we will provide some warnings. First, the report from 2012 and the data from 2011. Although justice has provided a specific figure, the actual figure may have increased or decreased in the following seven additional years. Second, multiplier effects are estimates and are highly dependent on the assumptions used. Various assumptions will lead to different results. The use of retail sales figure without multiplier modification may be a more defensive approach. Finally, the report states that \"it was funded by the National Shooting Sport Foundation and produced in partnership with the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies.\" The Society represents government officials who supervise the hunt, but the National Shooting Sport Corporation is billing itself as \"the firearms trade association.\" This means that the national security forces are an advocacy group with a particular interest in promoting fishing. As with any advocacy team, its data should be understood in this context. Our governor said that \"hunters contribute more than $500 million\" in West Virginia. These statistics come from a comprehensive report of 50 countries, but it should be noted that the data go back more than seven years, that they use an economic impact estimate that goes beyond retail sales, and that the report was financed by an industrial trading group. We're mostly evaluating the statement right.
