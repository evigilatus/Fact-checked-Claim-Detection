Susan Collins, R-Maine, in a response to one of Obama\u2019s Saturday radio addresses.\n\"In the past, most new jobs were full time, but, this year, the overwhelming majority of new jobs are part time,\" Collins said. \"Under this troubling trend, more workers will find their hours and their earnings reduced. Jobs will be lost. This is especially disturbing as our country is still battling high unemployment.\"\nThe other comment we will check separately is by Alan Krueger, the chairman of Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers: \"Since the Affordable Care Act passed, 90 percent of job growth has been in full-time positions.\"\nThese two comments paint sharply different pictures, so we turned to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nFor Collins, we looked at the change in full-time and part-time employment between December 2012 and July 2013, then determined which of the two types of employment accounted for a larger share of the increase in overall employment. Here\u2019s the summary:\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nDate\n\n\nFull-time employees\n\n\nPart-time employees\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 2012\n\n\n115,868,000\n\n\n27,502,000\n\n\n\n\nJuly 2013\n\n\n116,090,000\n\n\n28,233,000\n\n\n\n\nChange, Dec-July\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+222,000\n\n\n+731,000\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nSo Collins has a point -- 77 percent of the increase in employment over this period came from part-time jobs. We think a 3-to-1 ratio qualifies as \"overwhelming.\"\nStill, we will offer a few caveats.\n\u2022 A large majority of these jobs are being taken by people who want to work part time. BLS breaks part-time jobs into two categories -- people working part-time for economic reasons (meaning they want a full-time job, but have to settle for a part-time job), and people working part-time for noneconomic reasons (because they prefer a part-time schedule to a full-time schedule).\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nDate\n\n\nPart time for economic reasons\n\n\nPart time for noneconomic reasons\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDec. 2012\n\n\n7,918,000\n\n\n18,763,000\n\n\n\n\nJuly 2013\n\n\n8,245,000\n\n\n19,128,000\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nIn other words, about 70 percent of people working part time right now are doing so because they want to work part time, not because the economy is forcing them to.\nThis doesn\u2019t mean there are no problems associated with a rise in part-time jobs -- such a shift could make it harder for the recovery to gain momentum, said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist. Still, it\u2019s important to point out that most people taking part-time jobs aren\u2019t being forced into those jobs purely because of the economy.\n\u2022 Timing matters. If you use a longer time horizon, a large percentage of jobs created were full-time positions. \"Over longer periods, a much smaller percentage of job gains have taken the form of part-time jobs,\" said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution.\nIn other words, by choosing the time frame carefully, you can find support for either side of this argument.\nOur ruling\nCollins said, \"This year, the overwhelming majority of new jobs are part time.\" The statistics show that 77 percent of the increase in jobs between December 2012 and July 2013 consisted of part-time jobs. It\u2019s worth noting that longer time frames show the opposite pattern, and that most of the part-time jobs being created are being taken by people who actually want to work part time. Still, on the numbers, Collins is right, and we rate her claim True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09019"}
