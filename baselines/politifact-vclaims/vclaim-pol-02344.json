The toys were recalled ahead of Easter Sunday 2017. Not Easter 2018.\nFacebook users flagged news24fresh.info\u2019s story as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media\u2019s efforts to combat online hoaxes. News24fresh.info\u2019s website does not list any information identifying its mission statement, who runs it or who\u2019s behind it.\nHowever, the website does accurately note that the recall involves Hatch & Grow Easter Eggs, Easter Grow Toys (with model number 234-25-1200 on the back of the packaging) and Hatch Your Own Dino (with model number 234-09-0016 on a label inserted in the packaging).\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe website also has the right description of the potential health problems and complications that can happen if a child ingests the toy; that surgery may be required to retrieve it from the body; and that it may not show up on an X-ray.\nThe approximate amount of toys sold \u2014 560,000 \u2014 its estimated $1 price tag and Target\u2019s offering of a full refund due to the recall is also accurate, matching announcements posted by Target and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission.\nTarget also told PolitiFact that the recalls in the news24fresh.info post were all from last year.\nThe U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission told PolitiFact that generally there\u2019s no end date to recalls, unless there\u2019s an update about a company no longer being in business.\nConsumers can still follow up on Target\u2019s 2017 recall for the described Easter egg toys, the commission said.\nTarget did issue a recall for Easter egg toys. But it did so last year. While recalls generally don\u2019t expire, it seems clear to us that by reposting this story, news24fresh.info is trying to trick people into thinking the recall is new.\nWe rate this claim Half True.\n Share the Facts 2018-03-06 16:59:36 UTC   PolitiFact    4 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Half True  \"ALERT: Massive Easter Egg Recall Leaves MILLIONS Of Children In Danger- THROW THEM AWAY- They WILL Kill Your Kids.\"    news24fresh.info Bloggers https://www.news24fresh.info/alert-massive-easter-egg-recall-leaves-millions-of-children-in-danger-throw-them-away-they-will-kill-your-kids/   in a blog post Thursday, February 8, 2018 2018-02-08    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02344"}
