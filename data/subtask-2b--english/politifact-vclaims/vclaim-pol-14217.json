Those are facts you can measure by his record in the U.S. House of Representatives, where he served for 12 years before joining President George W. Bush\u2019s administration.\n\nOn a scale of liberal to conservative, Portman\u2019s ratings by special interest groups and by National Journal, an impartial magazine covering Washington, trended toward the conservative end, but that doesn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t cross the aisle to work with Democrats.\n\nJust how bi-partisan was Portman? Votes can vary depending on the agenda, and Portman has said he would have opposed the major legislative initiatives passed at the behest of the current president, Barack Obama. But he also said during the Oct. 8 debate with Democrat Lee Fisher at the City Club of Cleveland that he has a record in Congress \"of constantly reaching across the aisle and focusing on solutions.\"\n\n\"I often joke in front of Republican crowds, and probably people are a little nervous by the fact \u00a0that 12 of my bills were signed by President Clinton,\" Portman said.\n\nThis, too, is measurable. Did the Cincinnati-area Republican really get 12 of his bills signed by a Democratic president?\n\nThe short answer: It depends on how you count bills.\n\nThe long answer: More or less.\n\nWe are being conservative here because lawmakers sometimes claim credit for bills they supported when others really did the heavy lifting. That is not the case with Portman\u2019s count.\n\nBut counting bills isn\u2019t as simple as it may sound, and to show how Portman arrives at 12 we must show you, quite briefly, how the sausage is made.\n\nA member of Congress introduces a bill. Other members might sign on as co-sponsors. The bill may get assigned to a committee for review or hearings, and it might get a vote in the full House, then get a vote in the Senate and, if successful, become law with a president\u2019s signature.\n\nVery few bills go that route. Most never make it out of committee. Some get dissected in committee, only to be reassembled in new bill with different sponsors. So here\u2019s the question we faced in reviewing Portman\u2019s claim: Did 12 of his bills actually become freestanding laws signed by Clinton?\n\nNo. Four did, according to the official legislation tracking service called THOMAS (in honor of \u00a0Thomas Jefferson), maintained by the Library of Congress. The bills provided relief for states from the burdens of federal mandates; authorized the renaming of a federal courthouse; established and paid for programs to promote drug-free communities, and helped alleviate debt for countries that conserve and restore tropical rain forests.\n\nBut that number is misleading. THOMAS credits another successful Portman-sponsored bill to Sen. George Voinovich, the Republican whom Portman hopes to succeed. That\u2019s because Voinovich sponsored a Senate companion to Portman\u2019s House measure. The bill made it simpler for individuals and organizations outside of government to apply for federal financial assistance, and its supporters included Democrats such as Dennis Kucinich of Cleveland.\n\nThat makes five.\n\nBut it\u2019s unfair to stop there, because Portman sponsored another dozen bills that were folded into other legislation that Congress passed and Clinton signed. We know this because when was asked Portman\u2019s campaign to back up its claim, it gave us a list of 17 bills, and we researched them all -- examining not only the original bill\u2019s language and sponsorship but also the language in the final legislation to see how closely it tracked to the original. For example, Portman sponsored bills to make it easier for small employers to set up pensions, and for individual workers to establish retirement accounts. The components for those bills got folded into tax and small business bills -- with precise language coming from Portman\u2019s initial efforts.\n\nHe also sponsored two additional anti-drug bills that got folded into a big government spending bill that Clinton signed.\n\nJust to be purists, we excluded a couple of bills from the 17 because, according to THOMAS, Portman was not the sponsor but was, rather, the first and principle co-sponsor. One was to reform the Internal Revenue Service and strengthen taxpayer rights (although Portman had in fact introduced the same bill earlier). \u00a0Another was to promote Underground Railroad sites (former Rep. Louis Stokes of Shaker Heights was the sponsor of that one).\n\nBut Portman was the sponsor of another bill a year later that assured federal funding for the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center in Cincinnati. Supported by such colleagues as the late Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones, a Democrat of Cleveland, the bill became a provision in a government spending bill sponsored by yet another former Ohio lawmaker, Republican Ralph Regula of Stark County.\n\nSo let\u2019s do the math.\n\nPortman\u2019s campaign gave us a list of 17 bills. We quickly credited Portman on five of them. Twelve more got dissected in the course of legislative sausage-making, but the Portman provisions survived in others\u2019 legislation. But we subtracted two of those bills, because Portman was not the actual sponsor, even though he handled heavy lifting. So we were now down to 15.\n\nBut now we faced a question of double counting. If two bills get dissected and their provisions subsequently wind up in a single bill that the president signs, does that mean the president has signed both pieces of legislation? Or does the single new bill only count as one, despite its myriad components? \u00a0Who knew that lawmaking had existential questions?\n\nThis occurred twice. The first was when separate Portman-sponsored pension and retirement bills (he worked on a number of these) wound up in a single 1996 measure helping small businesses. The other time was when separate anti-drug bills (another recurring theme of his) were folded into a spending measure in 1998.\n\nJust for sport -- we started with a surplus of bills, after all -- we only counted these as one in each instance. So four four of bills got cut down to two.\n\nThat left us with 13, or one more than even Portman claimed.\n\nIf you think we were too harsh by removing two, go ahead and add them back in so the total becomes 15 again. Portman\u2019s campaign won\u2019t mind, then, if you dismiss a few of his bills as insignificant. One named the federal courthouse in Cincinnati after Potter Stewart. One transferred Army Corps of Engineers property to the village of Mariemont, near Cincinnati. And one established \u00a0the CIA headquarters as the George Bush Center for Intelligence (the measure got wrapped into the broader Intelligence Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 1999).\n\nDo all of this and you still wind up with an even dozen.\n\nWe bounced this method of counting off Stephen Hess, a senior fellow emeritus at the Brookings Institution and an expert on the ways of Washington.\n\nHess said that Portman appears to be taking credit where due, and no more. Comparing it with the standards of academia, Hess said, \"If you were writing your dissertation at Wayne State, could you get away with that? Probably so. It would probably just require a footnote.\"\n\nWhen asked, Portman\u2019s campaign was clear about that footnote. Portman\u2019s statement was accurate but needed clarification, which on the Truth-O-Meter is measured this way: Mostly True\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Boehner\n\n\nstated on July 15, 2010 in an op-ed in the Detroit News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Since February 2009, our economy has lost roughly 3 million private sector jobs while the federal government has grown by more than 400,000 jobs.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Sabrina Eaton \u2022 July 15, 2010", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-14217"}
