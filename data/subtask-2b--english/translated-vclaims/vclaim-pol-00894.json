Speculation about his intentions prompted the conservative growth club to issue a television announcement seeking to weaken the enthusiasm of Orrick among the major democratic voters. The announcement argues that Aurourke has moved on because of the \"white male privilege\" and is far from former President Barack Obama, where many made comparisons between Democrats. \"Obama defended progressive issues on campus, seeking to combat inequality and harmful stereotypes,\" said the Declaration. \"Pinto sustained them, and he complained to the working women, whose qualifications seemed only to be big breasts and tight buttocks.\" The Growth Club presented a fact sheet detailing the source of each statement in the Declaration. Sources include press articles and other online sources. Aurourke did not respond to the request for comment. The comment from the review of the plays during his senate race was that Aurourke's opponents discovered a 1991 review written by the Columbia University Students' Journal of Will Rogers Follies and shared it with Politico, who reported on its contents. In the review, O'Rourke said that the play was directed \"in such an occasional display, the glitz, and, ultimately, in a clich\u00e9, one cannot help disgust throughout the show.\" He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. By Bill McCarthy: January 12, 2021, \"Keith Karadin in the main role surrounded by smiling Prima representatives whose only qualifications appear to be their big breasts and narrow buttocks.\" O'Rourke later apologized for his comments and told Pol\u00edtico that he was embarrassed by what she wrote. \"There is no excuse to make disrespectful and offensive comments about women,\" he said. Our ruling growth club said that Aurourke made fun of working women whose qualifications seem to be just big breasts and tight buttocks. Aur\u00fcrk wrote this comment in a review of the student newspaper at Columbia University. The language used in the advertisement is misleading, because it implies that Oork was generally speaking about all women. We're mostly assessing this claim right. :: Editor &apos; s observation: This is one of four fact checks involving a claim contained in the announcement by the Club d &apos; Agneur television of Peto Aurourke.
