Clinton found inspiration from the response that came after five police officers were shot dead in Dallas.\n\"Chief David Brown asked the community to support his force, maybe even join them,\" Clinton said. \"And you know how the community responded? Nearly 500 people applied in just 12 days.\"\nClinton has it right.\nOn July 7 in Dallas, as a peaceful protest wrapped up in the evening, an Army veteran systematically opened fire on white police officers. By the time he was cornered and killed, five officers were dead.\nFour days later, the Dallas police chief held a press conference where he urged the public to understand the pressures facing his officers. And he addressed the protestors in the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\"We\u2019re hiring,\" Brown said. \"Get off that protest line and put an application in.\"\nThe plea seems to have worked.\nOn July 22,the Dallas Police Department posted the application numbers on its Facebook page.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the 12 days between July 8 and July 20, 467 people applied to work for the department.\nThere\u2019s been no further update on the department\u2019s Facebook page.\nOur ruling\nClinton said nearly 500 people applied to the Dallas Police Department in 12 days.
