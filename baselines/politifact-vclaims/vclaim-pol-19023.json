Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Green New Deal proposal, \u201cCows are out.\u201d", "truth_label": "false", "date": "stated on September 17, 2020 in Speech:", "title": "Trump misses the mark with claim that Green New Deal proposal wants to ban cows", "text": "In a recent visit to Wisconsin, President Donald Trump offered a series of warnings to voters, but here in the heart of dairy country one in particular stood out.\nTrump argued that if Joe Biden is elected president, other Democrats would try to jam through the so-called Green New Deal, a proposal aimed at combating climate change and positioning the U.S. for a more environmental-friendly economy.\nThe proposal was introduced by U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-New York, and supported by U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders and others in the Deomcratic presidential primary. Pointedly, Biden did not offer his support for it.\nIn his speech, Trump argued the Green New Deal sought to do a lot of things, including ban air travel (not true) and require a bridge be built to Hawaii (also not true).\nThen he landed on livestock.\n\"Cows are out,\" he said in the Sept. 17, 2020 speech. \"Cows, they don\u2019t want cattle, they don\u2019t want cows.\"\u00a0\nDoes the Democratic-backed Green New Deal really ban cows, a major source of beef and dairy products?\nNo.\u00a0\nLet\u2019s look closer.\nMore about the plan\nSince it was unveiled in February 2019, the Green New Deal has been a flashpoint in American politics.\u00a0\nIntroduced by Ocasio-Cortez and U.S. Sen. Edward Markey, D-Massachusetts, the plan calls on the government to reduce the country\u2019s reliance on fossil fuels and curb greenhouse gas emissions throughout the economy, according to a Feb. 21, 2019 report from the New York Times. The goals could be accomplished through making investments in cleaner energy and changing many facets of life, such as how buildings are designed, how people travel and what people eat.\u00a0\nBut what about cows?\u00a0\nAccording to a Feb. 12, 2019 examination of the Green New Deal by PolitiFact National, there is no actual mention of cows in the deal\u2019s text.\u00a0\nThe first mention of cows came in additional documents posted and shared by Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s staff around the time of the introduction of the resolution. The line in particular that critics seem to have latched onto states \"we aren\u2019t sure we\u2019ll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes.\"\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe statement was a part of a fact sheet that Ocasio-Cortez provided to media outlets, according to factcheck.org, and was also a blog post on her website.\nThose documents -- which were never part of the text of the bill -- have since been taken down, but that hasn\u2019t stopped the president from repeating the claim.\u00a0\nTo be sure, cows do play a role in rising global temperatures.\nCows produce methane gas as a byproduct of digestion, thanks to their multiple stomachs. That methane is typically released from their body in the form of burps and sometimes flatulence (ie. farting cows).\u00a0\nThose cow emissions add up to 70% of all such emissions from livestock, or about 5.5% of greenhouse gases tied to human activity, according to an Associated Press report. In comparison, emissions from the burning of fossil fuels is roughly 10 to 17 times greater than warming caused by livestock farting and burping, the same report said.\u00a0\nDigging deeper\nWhen we asked Trump\u2019s Wisconsin team for backup, they did not respond to the request.\nThe strongest evidence against the claim, though, may be comments from Ocasio-Cortez herself.\nShortly after critics took off with the cow claim, Ocasio-Cortez addressed the comments in an appearance on the \"Desus and Mero\" show on Showtime, according to a March 8, 2019, article in the\u00a0 New York Times headlined, in part, \"No one is taking your hamburgers. But would it even be a good idea?\"\nThat piece quotes Ocasio-Cortez saying:\n\"It\u2019s not to say you are going to force everybody to go vegan or anything crazy like that. But it\u2019s to say, listen, we\u2019ve got to address factory farming, maybe we shouldn\u2019t be eating a hamburger for breakfast, lunch and dinner.\"\u00a0\nResearchers have said, the Times article notes, that reducing the consumption of red meat, such as beef, would be better for peoples\u2019 health and the environment. But, it acknowledges,\u00a0 agriculture is a hard industry to completely \"decarbonize\"\u00a0 because it\u2019s about keeping people fed. And that would be hard to do without beef.\u00a0\nOr, for Wisconsin purposes, without dairy.\nOur ruling\nTrump claimed that the Green New Deal, proposed by liberal Democrats, among other things aims to ban cows: \"Cows are out \u2026 They don\u2019t want cattle, they don\u2019t want cows.\"\u00a0\nBut the text of the measure\u00a0 does not mention cows at all, a once-posted supporting document acknowledged it would be hard to ban \"farting cows\" and the main sponsor has explicitly said the proposal is \"not to say you are going to force everybody to go vegan or anything crazy like that.\"\nWe rate Trump\u2019s claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19023"}
