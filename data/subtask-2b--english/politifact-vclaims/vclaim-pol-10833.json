John Kasich\u2019s education agenda.\n\nBut many Democrats in the House of Representatives voted against the Republican governor\u2019s education policies, which included a third-grade reading guarantee, when they were up for a vote on June 13.\n\nTheir reasons for opposition varied.\n\nSome thought the changes amounted to an unfunded mandate on schools whose state funding already had been cut through Kasich\u2019s budget.\n\nRep. Dan Ramos, a Democrat from Lorain, said the bill was incomplete because it lacked early education programs such as all-day kindergarten to prepare young students, particularly children in poverty.\n\nDuring a floor speech June 13, Ramos made clear his district\u2019s educational needs:\n\n\"I represent, amongst others, the city of Lorain, which is the poorest urban school district in the state of Ohio.\"\n\nRamos was one of several lawmakers to speak that day about the bill, Senate Bill 316, also known as the \"education MBR\" because it was the education component of Kasich\u2019s mid-biennium budget review. The bill passed the House that day by a vote of 56-35, with most Democrats voting \"no.\"\n\nAlthough Ramos\u2019 claim is not about specific provisions in the bill, it caught our attention. Does Lorain really hold the unwanted title of the state\u2019s poorest urban school district.\n\nSo we called Ramos for an explanation.\n\nRamos said he did not have any statistics or information that showed Lorain is the state\u2019s single poorest district. He provided data from the Ohio Department of Education that shows the city is among districts with the highest percentage of poor students.\n\n\"I should have said, \u2018one of the\u2019\" poorest urban school districts, Ramos said.\n\nThe city had the state\u2019s sixth-highest percentage, 84.5 percent, of students in poverty in the fiscal year ending in July 2011. Students were considered to be living in poverty if they received free or reduced-priced lunches or if their guardians receive public assistance.\n\nCleveland was first, with 100 percent of students in poverty; Dayton was second with 92.5 percent; Youngstown was third with 91.9 percent; East Cleveland was fourth with 88.5 percent and Akron was fifth with 84.7 percent.\n\nLorain ranked fourth the previous year behind Cleveland, Dayton and Youngstown.\n\nRamos said the fact Lorain is among the state\u2019s poorest districts \u2013 rather than the single poorest \u2013 does not negate the overarching point of his floor speech: School children in Lorain are on hard times and need the state\u2019s help to get a better education, however, the policies in SB 316 do not fully address those needs.\n\nRamos may have a point. And he is correct to say students in Lorain are needy. But his explanation does not make his claim on the House floor accurate. The poorest urban school district in Ohio, in the eyes of the Ohio Department of Education, is Cleveland.\n\nOn the Truth-O-Meter, his claim rates False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10833"}
