The accounts of young children questioned by judges have been a source of public noise. The disturbing reports did not take much time: these children, some at an early age, appear as defendants in the Migration Court who are not accompanied by their parents or even lawyers. Some people have claimed that this practice was new, and it was initiated by Donald Trump's administration alone. This is wrong. A photo recently posted on Facebook repeats this allegation, and presents a picture of a young child with the word \"ICE\" written through it, along with the seal of the United States Department of Homeland Security. The additional text above and below says, \"For the first time in the history of 242 years from the United States of America... a one-year-old child appears in court as a defendant.\" The photo was made public as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There has been an increase in the number of unaccompanied children who have been represented in immigration courts over the past year, probably because of the harsh attitude taken by the Trump administration (as well as by a record number of families trying to cross the southern border of the United States) - but the same practice is not new. Megan McKenna, Principal Director of Communication and Community Participation for Children in Need of Defence, Polyte Fact, has been informed that young children have been subject to immigration procedures for years. \"It was always the case with the children. McKenna said that it was a different and evolving system but that children of all ages had to appear in deportation procedures.\" We've been referring to six-month-old children before Trump's administration, as well as all of them. The Home Security Act 2002 established the unaccompanied foreign children programme in 2002 when the Ministry of Internal Security was established. He outlined the State &apos; s approach to the care and treatment of minors who had entered the United States illegally or who had been separated from an adult. On 1 March 2003, the Internal Security Act 2002 transferred responsibilities for the care and care of these children from the Immigration and Naturalization Service to the Refugee Resettlement Office under the umbrella of the Ministry of Health and Human Services. Since then, the Rehabilitation Office has taken care of more than 340,000 migrant children, according to the programme &apos; s website. Facebook was published on January 11, 2021 in Facebook, Nancy Belusi, who was no longer the Speaker of the House of Representatives by Samantha Buterman: January 12, 2021 unaccompanied minors are placed in facilities for an average of 60 days, while waiting for hearings. They can also be released to their relatives or taken care of earlier. These children are not guaranteed the right to a lawyer, which is also before the Trump administration. The organization indirectly provides services by contracting the Vera Institute of Non-Profit Justice, an organization that \"works to safeguard the rights of tens of thousands of migrant children,\" according to its website. The Vera Institute is involved with a network of legal service providers throughout the United States who inform and defend migrant children of their rights under United States law in their legal proceedings as part of the unaccompanied children programme. While these non-profit legal institutions, which provide free services, certainly help children, McKenna states that many unaccompanied migrant children are underrepresented because the demand for lawyers willing to accept these cases is similar to the availability of lawyers. In January 2009, the Institute &apos; s lawyers began to provide legal advice to unaccompanied migrant children. According to a January 2018 report, the organization found that 50 per cent of children did not have representation in the Migration Court, making them five times more vulnerable to deportation. This is in line with data from the Core Resource Database, a clearing house of the Syracuse Migration Research University, which shows that approximately 52 per cent of all children subject to immigration court proceedings have been unrepresented on average since 2005. In the years since Trump took office, the proportion of children who did not have a representative has increased steadily, just as the raw number of cases itself has increased, in accordance with the target for resource allocation from the core funds. Unrepresented minors represented 32 per cent of children who faced deportation hearings in 2016, 50 per cent in 2017, 60 per cent in 2018 and 71 per cent so far in 2019. Also according to these data, 60,695 unaccompanied children attended deportation hearings in 2017, compared to 54,037 in 2016 and 32,536 in 2015. There has also been a dramatic increase in the number of infants and children who appear in immigration procedures under the Trump Administration, as shown by the data. In July 2018, the Kaiser Health News reported that 70 children under one year of age had attended deportation proceedings from 1 October 2017 to 30 June 2018. The number rose from the previous two years, to 24 in all fiscal year 2017 and 46 in fiscal year 2016. The Caesar report also stated, based on the Ministry of Justice &apos; s reviewed data, that a total of 1,500 unaccompanied children, from newborns to the age of 3, had been summoned to the Migration Court since 1 October 2015. Our viral judgment on social media claims that \"a one-year-old girl appears in court as an accused\" for the first time in the history of the United States. Recent data indicate that there has been a significant increase in the number of unaccompanied young children appearing in immigration procedures over the last fiscal year, but the Trump Administration has not implemented this practice - which has been in place for more than a decade.
