An image of what looks like a BBC article that\u2019s being shared on Facebook suggests that Maxwell will meet a similar end.\u00a0\n\"Ghislaine Maxwell moved to intensive care as coronavirus symptoms worsen,\" the headline says above an image of Maxwell. The article appears under the BBC\u2019s \"England\" tab. But the dateline is in the future: July 11, 2020.\n\"Death by executing oh I mean COVID-19 (MY BAD),\" one account commented on the Facebook post. \"The sheep will believe the virus cover up.\"\u00a0\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

The acting U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York announced the charges against Maxwell. When the BBC reported on the charges, the story appeared in its \"US & Canada\"\nsection.\nOn July 3, a self-described satire site posted a story claiming Maxwell had tested positive for COVID-19 in a New Hampshire jail. We found no credible reports that Maxwell has tested positive for the disease.\u00a0\nWe rate this image Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17695"}
