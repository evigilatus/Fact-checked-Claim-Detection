And it\u2019s coming from the architect of the lightning-rod Republican plan to turn Medicare into a program that pays for private insurance.\n\nVice presidential hopeful Paul Ryan claims an \"unelected, unaccountable\" board created by the health care law \"will lead to denied care for current seniors.\"\n\nHis language is more measured than other claims we\u2019ve weighed over the years about Medicare\u2019s new Independent Payment Advisory Board. But did he reach the truth?\n\nRyan trotted out the campaign line (and his Medicare-eligible mother, Betty) on \u00a0Aug. 18, 2012, in retiree-heavy Florida community The Villages, and repeated it two days later in New Hampshire.\n\n\"Here's what the president won't tell you about his Medicare plan, about Obamacare,\" he said. \"The president raids $716 billion from the Medicare program to pay for the Obamacare program. What's more, in addition to that, he puts a board of 15 unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats in charge of Medicare, who are required to cut Medicare in ways that will lead to denied care for current seniors.\"\n\nWe\u2019ve evaluated versions of the $716 billion claim, finding that the amount wasn\u2019t \"raided\" or \"robbed\" but that the law reduces future spending through a series of cost-saving measures. (Meanwhile, Ryan\u2019s own House budget took advantage of the same savings he attacks.) Here we\u2019re checking Ryan\u2019s comments about the Independent Payment Advisory Board.\n\n\u2018Unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats\u2019\n\nThe Independent Payment Advisory Board, slated to start work in 2013, was created by the health care law to put distance between politics and Medicare.\n\n(An evenhanded report from the Kaiser Family Foundation describes the board and its origin.)\n\nIts 15 full-time members aren\u2019t elected. But that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re unaccountable.\n\n\u2022\u00a0They\u2019re appointed by the president and approved by the Senate.\n\n\u2022 They can\u2019t serve more than two six-year terms.\n\n\u2022 Their recommendations can be rejected by Congress.\n\n\u2022\u00a0They must follow disclosure and ethics guidelines, and they can\u2019t perform other jobs as they serve.\n\n\u2022 They can be removed by the president for \"neglect of duty\" or \"malfeasance in office,\" though not for any other reason.\n\nHenry Aaron, an economist who specializes in health care and tax policy at the Brookings Institution, says they\u2019re accountable in the same sense that members of any federal regulatory commission are accountable \u2014 they serve fixed terms and can be removed for cause.\n\nBut Gail Wilensky, a health economist who directed the Medicare and Medicaid programs from 1990 to 1992 under President George H.W. Bush, argues that all members of independent commissions, once appointed and confirmed \"are almost impossible to move or influence.\"\n\nBy contrast, she says, other types of presidential appointees, such as Cabinet members, can be pressured to resign if they make serious mistakes.\n\nIn addition to limiting the reasons a board member might be removed, lawmakers sought to insulate the board\u2019s decisions from special-interest lobbying.\n\n\u2022\u00a0Its recommendations are fast-tracked in Congress and go into effect automatically if lawmakers fail to act.\n\n\u2022 Implementation of its recommendations isn\u2019t subject to administrative or judicial review.\n\nSo, board members aren\u2019t elected, but while their decisions are protected by law, they are to some degree accountable. In particular, they could fail to win a second term, or get fired by the president.\n\nAre they bureaucrats?\n\nThey become members of the bureaucracy by definition once they join the board. But they won\u2019t all start that way. The law specifies that members will represent a mix of different professions, from health finance and economics to health facility management to medicine.\n\nIn other words, the same kind of people who might advise health care spending decisions outside of government.\n\n\u2018Required to cut Medicare\u2019\n\nIf Medicare grows too quickly, the Independent Payment Advisory Board is required to recommend cuts. But it won\u2019t have as large an impact as you might imagine.\n\nObama\u2019s health care law, the Affordable Care Act, reduces Medicare\u2019s growth by more than $700 billion over the next 10 years, as we noted above.\n\nHow much savings will the board generate? Less than 4 percent of net Medicare savings in the law\u2019s first decade, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nRecommendations from the board probably wouldn\u2019t be necessary after that, according to Medicare\u2019s actuary. That\u2019s because it only has to recommend cuts in years that Medicare misses its growth targets. After 2019, other savings in the health care law, if allowed to take effect, would keep the program in check.\n\nSo it\u2019s fair to say the bulk of the savings in the law are outside the board\u2019s purview.\n\nIt\u2019s only if those other measures fail to keep Medicare spending on track that the board is required to recommend additional ways to save. Meanwhile, if Congress comes up with another way to achieve the savings, it could overrule the board\u2019s proposals.\n\n\u2018Denied care\u2019\n\nRyan said the board would \"cut Medicare in ways that will lead to denied care for current seniors.\"\n\nBut by law, the board can\u2019t ration care. It can\u2019t change benefits. It can\u2019t change eligibility. It can\u2019t increase what seniors pay.\n\nSo it\u2019s expected to cut payments to providers. That could be a problem, since some providers say they\u2019re underpaid already. New York Times and USA Today stories in 2009 and 2010, for example, feature doctors opting out of Medicare because of its low payment rates.\n\nHow might that affect care? Imagine, say critics, being unable to find a nearby hospital or doctor who takes Medicare. Or discovering that payments for a particular service or procedure have been reduced.\n\n\"In that way, at least in theory, you could get actual denial of care,\" said Michael Tanner, a health care analyst for the libertarian Cato Institute, who opposes the health care law.\n\nThe Medicare actuary, Richard Foster, estimated that savings from the entire health care law would make about 15 percent of hospitals, skilled nursing facilities and home health agencies unprofitable by 2019.\n\nThat means, presumably, that to stay open they would need to shift costs to non-Medicare patients, merge with other providers or withdraw from Medicare, he said.\n\nThat\u2019s one reason he\u2019s testified that growth reduction under the law isn\u2019t sustainable in the long range.\n\nIt\u2019s \"a serious issue,\" said Wilensky, the Bush-era Medicare official.\n\nBut that\u2019s the projected effect for the entire law. Meanwhile, the board itself is required to consider \"to the extent feasible\" how its recommendations would affect access to care, especially in rural and other underserved areas.\n\nOur ruling\n\nRyan said that Obama \"puts a board of 15 unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats in charge of Medicare who are required to cut Medicare in ways that will lead to denied care for current seniors.\"\n\nBoard members aren\u2019t elected, but it\u2019s a stretch to say they\u2019re entirely unaccountable. They\u2019re appointed by the president and approved by the Senate. The president can fire them for neglect of duty or malfeasance.They\u2019re required to recommend cuts to Medicare in years that other cost-saving measures don\u2019t meet growth targets \u2014 but Congress can overrule their recommendations.\n\nMeanwhile, \"denied care\" is a strong way to phrase the board\u2019s possible effect. It\u2019s expected to recommend cutting provider payments, with an eye on cutting waste and inefficiency. That could restrict some seniors\u2019 access to care, depending on the what actions the board actually takes. Meanwhile, the board oversees only a small percentage of the Medicare savings in the health care law.\n\nRyan creates the specter of an unaccountable board making all of Medicare\u2019s spending decisions, but that\u2019s scarcely the case. There\u2019s an element of truth to his claim, but his overstatements add up to a Mostly False impression.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKarl Rove\n\n\nstated on December 22, 2009 in an interview with Fox News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In Florida, Sen.
