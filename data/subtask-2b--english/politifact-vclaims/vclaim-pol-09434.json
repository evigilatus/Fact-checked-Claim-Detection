Did they vote against a majority of Americans?\n\"No poll done this year ... shows less than a majority to reinstate a federal ban on assault weapons,\" Feinstein said.\nWe went in search of polls.\n\u2018Assault weapons\u2019\nWe combed through 18 polls with questions about assault weapons conducted between Jan. 9 and April 7. Nearly half of them occurred in January, both before and after President Barack Obama released his plan to reduce gun violence.\nHe called for \"banning military-style assault weapons.\"\nFeinstein\u2019s bill, introduced a week after the president\u2019s plan, proposed blocking the future manufacture, possession, sale and importation of 157 specific \"semiautomatic assault weapons,\" such as AK-47s and UZIs, along with any other weapon with a detachable magazine and at least one \"military characteristic,\" such as a pistol grip or barrel shroud.\nPollsters used a range of phrases to describe firearms as they asked Americans about their support or opposition to a ban, from \"assault rifles and semiautomatic weapons\" to \"military-style assault weapons.\"\nHere's a quick look at the results:\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPoll\n\n\nDate\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\nSupport for ban\n\n\n\n\nReason-Rupe\n\n\nJan. 17-21, 2013\n\n\n\"Do you think people should be prohibited from owning assault weapons, or should people be allowed to own them?\"\n\n\n44%\n\n\n\n\nCNN/ORC International\n\n\nApril 5-7, 2013\n\n\n\"Please tell me whether you would generally favor or oppose each of the following proposals which some people have made to reduce the amount of gun violence. ...

That means the polls reflected support between 48 percent and 54 percent, perhaps a majority and perhaps not. In other words, the \"majority\" wasn\u2019t statistically significant.\nAnd one poll, from the libertarian Reason Foundation, asked the question in a distinctly different way, and got a different result. Most pollsters asked whether people supported or opposed a ban on assault weapons. Reason asked: \"Do you think people should be prohibited from owning assault weapons, or should people be allowed to own them?\"\nThey found that just 44 percent of respondents thought people should be prohibited from owning assault weapons.\nWe\u2019ll note that the question goes beyond Feinstein\u2019s legislation. Nothing in the bill would have prohibited people who already owned such weapons from keeping them.\nStill, argued Emily Ekins of Reason, \"response variability across polls demonstrates support for an assault weapons ban is not as clear cut as some may have previously thought.\"\nIndeed, a USA Today/Gallup poll from December, in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook shootings, also showed only 44 percent support for a law similar to Feinstein\u2019s.\nMeanwhile, polls showed a partisan divide. In a January poll from Pew Research Center, for example, 55 percent of respondents favored an assault weapons ban. But just 44 percent of Republicans did. And a separate poll from Quinnipiac University in February showed that nearly half of Republicans might be less likely to vote for a member of Congress who voted for a ban on the sale of assault weapons \u2014 in addition to a third of independents and 11 percent of Democrats. That lack of support was most pronounced in the West.\nSo, while national support was generally strong, as Feinstein said, individual lawmakers faced a different reality.\nOur ruling\nFeinstein claimed that a majority of the American people supported her bill, saying \"no poll done this year ... shows less than a majority to reinstate a federal ban on assault weapons.\"\nShe's largely accurate, though the \"majority\" in two national polls wasn\u2019t statistically significant, and a poll by a libertarian foundation showed less than majority support for prohibiting assault weapon ownership. Meanwhile, limiting her statement to \"this year\" excluded a USA Today/Gallup poll from December that undermined her point.\nStill, the libertarian poll went beyond Feinstein\u2019s proposal, which didn\u2019t prohibit ownership of assault weapons by those who already own them. Otherwise, two polls teetered on the edge of majority support, while 15 others unequivocally supported her claim. We rate her statement Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09434"}
