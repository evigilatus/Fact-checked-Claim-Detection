And I want them to use American steel, American product. I want it manufactured here. And I made those changes just before we signed it. I said, Where's the steel coming from? So, all pipelines that are coming into this country from now on has to be American steel, which is really a big factor.\nSo, while mentioning the Keystone, which still needs approvals before it can be built, Trump is claiming \"all pipelines that are coming into\" the United States have to be made with American steel.\nThe Keystone XL\u00a0\nProposed by energy giant TransCanada, the 1,179-mile Keystone XL would transport more than 800,000 barrels of oil per day from Western Canada to Nebraska. Then it would connect with an existing pipeline system to refineries on the Gulf Coast, where the oil would be turned into petroleum products such as gasoline. The refineries export about two-thirds of their products; the rest is sold in the United States.\nThe project had been in limbo for more than seven years when the company\u2019s application to build the pipeline was rejected in November 2015 by President Barack Obama. He said the pipeline wouldn't serve U.S. national interests and would undercut America's global leadership on climate change.\nIn contrast, Trump promised during the 2016 presidential campaign that he would build the Keystone and get \"a piece of the profits\" -- a pledge that\u2019s been rated In the Works on PolitiFact\u2019s Trump-O-Meter.\nAn important step was taken in March 2017 when, at Trump\u2019s urging, the State Department issued a presidential permit for the Keystone. The permit is necessary for the pipeline to cross the U.S.-Canadian border. But before the pipeline can be built, it must win approval from the Nebraska Public Service Commission and local landowners.\nThe steel connection, meanwhile, relates to a memorandum regarding construction of American pipelines that Trump signed in January 2017.\nKeystone and steel\nThe memorandum calls for U.S oil pipelines to use American steel in their construction -- but it is not an order carrying strict requirements.\nThe memo directs the secretary of commerce to \"develop a plan under which all new pipelines, as well as retrofitted, repaired, or expanded pipelines, inside the borders of the United States,\" use materials and equipment produced in the United States, \"to the maximum extent possible and to the extent permitted by law.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFive weeks after Trump signed the memorandum, the White House stated explicitly that it does not apply to the Keystone XL.\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that because the Keystone is not a \"new\" project, it is not bound by the memo. \"But I know that everything moving forward would be -- fall under that (memorandum),\" she said.\n(The White House didn't provide us any information to back up Trump's claim.)\nWhile carrying the weight of the president\u2019s signature, the memorandum has the force of law only over the executive branch of the federal government. (And for that matter, it is arguably a lesser form of presidential action than an executive order.)\nMoreover, as Reuters has reported, the memorandum contains \"legal language about ordering things to the maximum extent permitted by law, which is designed to preserve lots of wiggle-room\"; and the attempt to mandate the use of American steel \"would almost certainly violate 70 years of settled international trade law.\"\nChris Weld, a Washington trade lawyer whose firm represents American steel companies, told the Washington Post that the memorandum is not a mandate, but rather \u00a0\"a message to U.S. pipeline operators to consider steps to purchase U.S.-produced iron and steel.\"\nMeanwhile, the Keystone, while not yet under construction, is nevertheless well under way.\nTransCanada has said it already has purchase agreements for the 660,000 tons of steel it will use for the Keystone XL. Half is to come from the Arkansas plant of an India-based steelmaker, 10 percent from a plant in India and the rest imported from Canada and Italy.\nTrump, meanwhile, reportedly will sign an executive order directing the Commerce Department to investigate whether steel imports into the United States should be blocked on national security grounds.\nOur rating\nWhile mentioning the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline, Trump said: \"All pipelines that are coming into this country from now on has to be American steel.\"\nThe White House made it clear weeks earlier that a memorandum signed by Trump related to the use of American steel does not apply to the Keystone -- only to new pipeline projects.\nAnd though the memorandum could put pressure on pipeline companies to use American steel, it does not contain any requirements that only American steel be used.\nWe rate Trump\u2019s statement False.\ndiv class='artembed'> Share the Facts 2017-04-20 16:58:26 UTC   Politifact    5 1 7  Politifact Rating: False  \"All pipelines that are coming into this country from now on has to be American steel.\"    Donald Trump President   In an interview Tuesday, April 18, 2017 2017-04-18    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03405"}
