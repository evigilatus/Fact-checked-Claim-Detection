The onetime candidate for a New York City congressional seat has 156,000 followers on Facebook.\u00a0\nHis July 14 Facebook post said (typo\u00a0included): \"The Flordia Covid-19 Outbreak is being EXPOSED as a HOAX!\" It included an image of a tweet he posted on Twitter, which also misspelled the state name:\n\"BREAKING: Orlando Health admits their Covid-19 numbers are wrong, saying it shows 98% positive, but it\u2019s actually 9.4%. This explains the \u2018outbreak\u2019 in Flordia.\"\nOne commenter wrote: \"I knew it!\"\nOther Facebook users made similar claims, saying for example that 33 Florida labs reported \"98% positivity instead of 9.8%. Another claimed the state Department of Health \"increased the COVID-19 case number by a whopping 90%.\" There is no evidence of that.\u00a0\nSaladino\u2019s Facebook post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThere have been discrepancies, and some confusion, in how test results are reported to the state.\nBut the size of the COVID-19 outbreak has to do with raw numbers of people in Florida who test positive for infection \u2014 not what percentage of test results are positive.\u00a0\nFlorida\u2019s COVID-19 outbreak\nOn July 12, the Sunshine State made headlines by recording 15,300 new coronavirus cases \u2014 breaking the U.S. record for most coronavirus cases in a day.\nFlorida led the nation in the number of cases over the previous seven days, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported July 15.\nThe same day, the Florida Department of Health announced that on July 14, its new cases reflected a nearly 14% positive rate \u2014 that is, the number of people who test positive for the first time divided by all tests. That\u2019s higher than the 11% positive rate for the 3.4 million tests done during the state\u2019s entire outbreak.\n\"I think the way our community has come back together over the last couple of weeks has really just been inconsistent with preventing the spread of a respiratory virus,\" Dr. Angus Jameson, medical director with Pinellas County Emergency Medical Services, told the Tampa Bay Times on the record-setting day.\nThe news story: 98% or 9.4%\nSaladino\u2019s Facebook post came the day that Fox 35, a television station in Orlando, did a news story about COVID-19 testing in Florida. The story said that all, or nearly all, of the tests done at some labs were reported to the state as being positive for the virus.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 25, 2021 in a blog post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWHO now saying you do not need to wear a mask.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat included, according to the story, Orlando Health reporting a 98% positive rate to the state on a batch of tests.\u00a0\nThe hospital \"confirmed errors\" to the station, according to the story, and said the actual positive rate was only 9.4%.\nThe story was picked up by Fox News and the conservative-leaning Washington Examiner.\nWhat Orlando Health says\nOrlando Health has 450 locations, including 13 hospitals, as well as clinics, labs and other facilities. Kena Lewis, a spokeswoman for the system, told PolitiFact there has been confusion over how the state Department of Health website reports testing results.\u00a0\nOn one page, showing data as of July 15, Orlando Health is listed with 98% of its 522 tests showing a positive result.\nBut Lewis gave us data showing the positive rate is only 10% when all 13 of the system\u2019s hospitals, which go by different names, are taken into account. The rate was 9.4% as of July 12, she said.\nMistakes in reporting test results\nAnother problem, according to the Department of Health, is some smaller labs were reporting only the tests that had positive results to the state.\nOn the day the TV story aired, the department issued a statement saying it \"immediately began working with those labs to ensure that all results were being reported in order to provide comprehensive and transparent data. As the state continues to receive results from various labs, the department will continue educating these labs on proper protocol for reporting COVID-19 test results.\"\nDr. Raul Pino, the local health officer for the Florida Department of Health in Orange County, told the Orlando Sentinel that in tracking most diseases like gonorrhea or HIV, negative tests typically aren\u2019t reported, but in a pandemic, calculating the positivity rate is important to track the spread.\nAs for the errors, Pino said they don\u2019t explain the state\u2019s overall outbreak. \"It takes a lot to change\" the state\u2019s overall positivity rate, Pino said.\nThe state Department of Health and Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019 office did not respond to our request for additional information on how sites report test results.\nOn July 15, DeSantis echoed Pino\u2019s point, saying \"a number of labs are still doing the default, sending positive only without negatives. They are not trying to be underhanded. But we have identified it and they will start doing the negatives as well.\"\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post claimed: \"Wrong\" COVID-19 case count by Orlando Health \"explains the 'outbreak' in Florida.\"\nState data show one hospital in the 13-hospital Orlando Health system reporting a 98% positive rate on its 522 coronavirus tests. However, systemwide, Orlando Health\u2019s positive rate is about 10%.\nAround the state, some small labs have reported only positive tests to the state, possibly skewing to a small extent Florida\u2019s overall positive test rate.\nBut the size of the COVID-19 outbreak in Florida is reflected in the overall numbers \u2014 including the 301,810 total cases and Florida setting a one-day national record for cases.\nWe rate the statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17745"}
