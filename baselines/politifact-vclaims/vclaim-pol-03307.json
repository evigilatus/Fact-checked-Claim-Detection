Blumenthal says", "text": "Among Democrats\u2019 many gripes with the House Republican health care bill is the fact that it\u2019s missing a special protection for veterans.\n\"What does Trumpcare do? Yank tax credits away from veterans unlike any other American,\" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., at a May 9 press conference.\nDoes the health care bill supported by President Donald Trump actually strip veterans of a tax protection?\nThis issue is more complex and less far-reaching than Blumenthal\u2019s exaggerated one-liner suggests. It is possible that if the Republican bill were to become law in its current form, a subset of veterans might not be able to access financial assistance that would enable them to choose private insurance over health care through the Veterans Administration.\nBut the language of the bill actually treats veterans like \"any other American,\" as opposed to what Blumenthal said. And there are regulations the Trump administration could pursue to blunt any impact (by taking a page out of the the previous administration\u2019s playbook, we\u2019d add).\nWhat the GOP health care bill omits\nBoth the Affordable Care Act and the Republican health care bill (the American Health Care Act) provide government financial assistance to low-income Americans buying health insurance plans on the individual market through tax credits that subsidize premiums.\nTo qualify for the tax credits under either system, a person cannot also be eligible for other affordable health insurance options, like employer-provided insurance, Medicaid or military-related health care.\nPoint being, if you have access to Medicaid or can get insurance from your company, the government won\u2019t pay for you to get insurance a different way.\nBut there is an exemption to that rule under the Democratic-supported\u00a0Affordable Care Act. Veterans who qualify for Veterans Administration health care (not all do) but aren\u2019t enrolled in the system are eligible for subsidized premiums \u2014 allowing these veterans to choose between VA health care or subsidized private insurance.\nThe Republican bill doesn\u2019t include language that would have the same effect.\nThis means that if the Republican bill were to become law in its current form, some veterans might not be able to access the tax credit. That means they\u2019d either have to get their health care through the VA or pay full freight for a different type of insurance.\nThis could have a tangible impact on veterans who choose not to take part in VA health care for reasons outside their control, such as living far away from VA facilities.\nHow broad is the impact?\nBlumenthal said the Republican bill in its current form could affect as many as 8 million veterans, which is the approximate number of veterans as of June 2014 who qualify for VA benefits but choose not to enroll in the program, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\nBut not all 8 million are in the market for a tax credit to help them buy private insurance. Many get health care through other means, such as Medicaid, their employer, or TRICARE, the military health benefits program. And as we already explained, that means they could not get federal subsidies to purchase a plan on the individual market under either Obamacare or its possible replacement.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA report by the Urban Institute, a social and economic policy think tank, found that subsidized premiums under the Affordable Care Act played a big role in the 40 percent drop in uninsured veterans between 2013-15. But the Urban Institute\u2019s numbers suggest that the omission from the Republican health care bill would affect far fewer than 8 million veterans.\nIn 2010, the year Obama signed the Affordable Care Act, there were 520,000 uninsured veterans eligible for subsidized premiums, according to a 2012 report. By 2015, that number dropped to 225,000. And it\u2019s still a subset of these groups who would be impacted by the Republican bill \u2014 those who qualify for subsidies and VA benefits.\nFor scale, there are 21.6 million living veterans as of 2014.\nWhy the omission?\nInterestingly, an earlier version of the Republican health care bill did include the relevant language, but it was removed from the final version that passed the House \u2014 a point that Blumenthal\u2019s staff emphasized to us.\nIncluding non-budgetary language, such as this veterans provision, could derail Republicans\u2019 plan to get the bill through the Senate using a special procedure called reconciliation.\nRep. Phil Roe, R-Tenn., has defended the omission, saying that existing federal regulations stemming from the Affordable Care Act will be able to ensure VA-eligible veterans can qualify for the tax credit.\nWhy? There\u2019s another wrinkle to all of this. The Affordable Care Act veteran exemption isn\u2019t found in the text of the Affordable Care Act itself. It\u2019s actually a 2012 IRS rule.\nContrary to Roe\u2019s point, however, regulations applied to one law don\u2019t automatically apply to that law\u2019s replacement, said Lisa Zarlenga, a Washington lawyer for Steptoe and Johnson who served as the Treasury\u2019s tax legislative counsel during Affordable Care Act implementation. If the Republican health bill becomes law, the Treasury and IRS might decide that the Affordable Care Act veterans rule carries over, but it\u2019s not guaranteed, she said.\nClose readers might have noticed an irony: The Democrats are criticizing the Republican bill for a protection that wasn\u2019t built into the Affordable Care Act to begin with.\nIn fact, the Treasury and IRS wrote the 2012 rule to deal with the difficulty of determining a particular veteran\u2019s VA-eligibility. The fact that this rule also gives some veterans a degree of choice they otherwise wouldn\u2019t have was an added benefit, Zarlenga said.\nOur ruling\nBlumenthal said, \"What does Trumpcare do? Yank tax credits away from veterans unlike any other American.\"\nA reasonable person might hear Blumenthal\u2019s statement and think that under the Republican health care bill, most or all veterans won\u2019t get a tax credit to which they are entitled. It\u2019s much more nuanced than that.\nUnder the Republican plan, like the Affordable Care Act, a person cannot qualify for financial assistance to help them buy an individual health insurance policy if they have access to other affordable health care options. Regulations written in 2012 to comply with the Affordable Care Act said this rule doesn\u2019t apply to veterans who are eligible but not enrolled in the Veterans Administration health care system.\nThe Republican bill doesn\u2019t contain language that would have the same effect. So if it becomes law in its current form, a subset of veterans might not be able to access financial assistance that would enable them to choose private insurance over health care through the VA. But a Republican administration could do what the Democrats did before them and include the benefit as part of a regulatory change.\nBlumenthal\u2019s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.\n Share the Facts 2017-05-15 20:32:34 UTC   Politifact    3 1 7  Politifact Rating: Half True  \"What does Trumpcare do?
