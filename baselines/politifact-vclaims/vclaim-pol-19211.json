No. This article was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nThe notice cautions lab technicians that positive results should be interpreted with care and in the context of other information, such as clinical observation and patient history, to reduce the risk of false positives.\nThe notice \u2014 dated Jan. 13 and published on the site Jan. 20, according to the timestamp on it\u00a0\u2014 is written in highly technical language. But five virologists, most of whom work in COVID-19 testing labs, told us that the gist of it was to remind lab technicians to carefully read the user manuals that come with PCR tests, the most widely used diagnostic tests for the coronavirus.\u00a0\n\"This is not new information. This is essentially a reminder from the WHO to testing laboratories,\" said Jonathan Jarry, a science communicator with the McGill University Office for Science and Society. \"This notice is not an admission that the PCR test for COVID-19 does not work or is wildly inaccurate.\"\u00a0\nHow the tests work\nCoronavirus tests are performed on samples of cells taken with a swab from the back of the throat. The lab isolates the genetic material from those cells and analyzes it for traces of the virus.\nPCR tests, considered the most reliable, work by duplicating the genetic material in cycles until traces of the virus become more easily detectable. If there\u2019s a large presence of virus in the sample, fewer cycles would be required to detect it, said Davidson Hamer, a professor of medicine at Boston University.\u00a0\nThe number of cycles required to detect the virus in a sample is known as a \"cycle threshold.\" A low cycle threshold implies that a patient has a high risk of spreading the coronavirus to others.\nThe question for lab technicians is how many times to duplicate a particular sample before determining whether it is positive or negative.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 22, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHank Aaron\u2019s death was caused by a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Noah Y. Kim \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Once you get up there in cycles, you can start detecting very small concentrations of virus,\" Hamer said.\u00a0\nAs a result, a sample that tests positive after many amplification cycles is more likely to be a false positive than a sample that tests positive after fewer cycles. Nevertheless, Hamer said, false positives with PCR tests, even those with relatively high cycle thresholds, remain rare.\u00a0\n\"PCR tests are considered the gold standard of diagnostic tests,\" said Maureen Ferran, an associate professor of biology at the Rochester Institute of Technology.\u00a0\nJoshua Sharfstein, vice dean at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, cautioned against viewing a low cycle threshold value as a strict indicator of high infectivity,\u00a0 because some samples are less representative of the patient\u2019s overall viral load than others.\u00a0\n\"It depends on how good the sample is,\" he said. The cycle threshold value \"will measure the viral load for a particular sample, but not necessarily a patient.\"\u00a0\nIn addition, the amount of cycles required to determine whether a patient is positive varies among different types of PCR tests.\u00a0\n\"There are different tests that have different thresholds,\" said Ben Neuman, a Texas A&M University-Texarkana virologist. \"Each lab knows where the thresholds are, and it\u2019s their job to give you the results of your test based on their setup.\"\u00a0\nThat\u2019s why the WHO notice urges lab technicians to view weak positive test results (ones with high cycle thresholds) with caution and to consult the instructions on their PCR machinery before issuing positive or negative test results.\nGateway Pundit did not respond to our request for comment.\nOur ruling\nA Gateway Pundit article claims that the \"WHO admits their testing grossly overstates individuals testing positive for COVID,\" citing a notice from the organization.\nHowever, the notice cited by the article is a reminder to lab technicians to carefully read the user\u2019s manuals that come with PCR tests to ensure that results are interpreted correctly. It is not an admission that PCR tests don\u2019t work or result in huge numbers of false positives.\nThis claim is False. \u200b", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19211"}
