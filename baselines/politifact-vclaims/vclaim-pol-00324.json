Of the Democrats running for president who were in Congress at the time, Kucinich is the only one who voted against the war resolution.\n\nBut to earn the crown as the \"first\" -- whatever that means, and Kucinich's campaign wouldn't clarify -- is a more nuanced privilege.\n\n\nWas he the first person? No. Was he the first Congressman? No. Was he the first presidential candidate? No (Correct answer: Republican Ron Paul). Was he the first Democratic presidential candidate? Yes.\n\n\nAccording to the Congressional Record, the Cleveland Democrat first spoke against the war in the context of Iraq in remarks made March 20, 2002. Kucinich advocated peace and warned against the slippery slope of nuclear weapons. (Paul spoke out on Nov. 29, 2001 saying \"the argument that (Saddam) Hussein is producing weapons of mass destruction is the reddest of all herrings,\" according to the Congressional Record.)\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.
