This video is not an accurate representation of the Pelosi speech, as some social media users, whether drunk or disabled, are skeptically slow to sound. Nancy Belusi, Speaker of the House of Representatives at President Trump's infrastructure meeting, said: \"It was very, very, very strange,\" with a video of about three minutes. The video was posted on the Facebook page for a account called Politics Watch Dog. The Washington Post published a story on May 23, entitled \"Pelocie's fake videos, slow to make them appear drunk, spread through social media.\" The story included a video of Policy WatchDog and referred to other videos published on YouTube that slowed down her speech or suggested that Pelosi speak drunk. The Policy Watch article was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) On 22 May, Belusi attended the American Progressive Thought Conference and spoke of the failure of a meeting between President Donald Trump, President Belusi and President Sen. While they were supposed to talk about infrastructure, Trump came out of the meeting, Belusi said, wondering about Trump's intentions to work on policy. \"That was so, so, so weird,\" said Belusi about the short meeting with Trump. The real voice of C-SPAN is significantly different from what policy surveillance has published. We sent links to experts to Facebook and to C-Spain' coverage of this event. Says Siwai Liu, Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of Albany, State University of New York, whose forensic research includes digital media. Leo analyzed the sound tracks and said that there was a \"clear difference in frequency\" with the sound on Facebook showing signs of stretching. Facebook was published on January 11, 2021 in an article by Nancy Belusi on Facebook that was no longer the Speaker of the House of Representatives by Samantha Buterman: January 12, 2021 \"I can hear the artifacts in the sound that would be consistent with the slow-down video and the sound being extended,\" said Cole Whitcotton, an expert in information technology at the National Forensic Media Centre at Colorado Denver University. The Facebook video also contains duplicate frames, as Matthew S. Stamm, an assistant professor at Drexel University, said. Stam said, which focuses on developing techniques to detect fake images and videos. The experts said that it was more difficult to establish whether the video had been deliberately manipulated or appeared to be different because of poor broadcasting or other issues related to video imaging and coding. The policy surveillance video has at least 2.4 million views and has been shared at least 47,000 times. We contacted the Policy Monitor for comment, but we didn't hear anything on time. Just so you know, we never claimed that Speaker Belusi was drunk. We can't control what people think of comments. It's a free state. For your information, we're not a conservative press executive. Washington Post is fake news!\" On 23 May, the Policy Watch newspaper was published on Facebook. On May 23, Trump tweeted a separate video that also took a punch in Belusi. Trump wrote on Twitter \"PLOSI STAMMERS through the news conference,\" along with a video from Fox Business, which showed a series of cases in which Pelosi repeated, reworded or stumbled upon some words. Commentators in the video asked \"What's going on\" with Belusi. The Deputy Chief of Staff of Belusi, Drew Hamel, on Twitter, called the second video, one in Tramp's tweet, \"Doctor,\" linked to the Washington Post report on inaccurate videos about Belusi growing on social media. The second video was definitely edited to paint Belosi in the worst light. However, along with the video footage shared by Trump with another copy taken by journalists, it appears that the voice of Pelosi was not manipulated. More importantly, the video that Trump shared on Twitter is not the same as the video published by Policy Watch. Our Facebook video gives the impression that Belusi gave her speech at a public event that is not an accurate account of how she spoke at the event. We're assessing this pants mail on fire.
