0035	SYSTEM	[ through translator ]
0036	RAMOS	We will make our questions in English and they will be translated simultaneously into Spanish for our viewers.
0037	RAMOS	And right now, each one of them has one minute for your initial words.
0038	RAMOS	We begin with Secretary Clinton.
0039	CLINTON	Thank you very much.
0040	CLINTON	I've been looking forward to this debate, and I want to thank Univision, the Washington Post, Facebook and MiamiDade College, the largest college in North America for hosting us here this evening.
0041	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0042	CLINTON	And tonight I am looking forward to the opportunity to discuss how we knock down the barriers that stand in the way of people getting ahead and staying ahead, starting with the economic ones.
0043	CLINTON	My focus is on more good paying jobs with rising incomes for families and how we prevent corporations from taking jobs out of our country by imposing an exit tax, making them pay back any tax breaks they've gotten.
0044	CLINTON	But we also need to be having a positive agenda for manufacturing.
0045	CLINTON	for small businesses and entrepreneurs, for more clean energy jobs.
0046	CLINTON	And I also look forward to discussing comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship that will be one of my priorities in my first 100 days as president.
0047	CLINTON	And I will also be talking about education, every child deserves a good teacher and a good school.
0048	SALINAS	Thank you, Secretary.
0049	CLINTON	And so thank you for having us, and I look forward to the debate.
0050	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0051	SALINAS	Thank you.
0052	SALINAS	Senator Sanders, your opening remarks.
0053	SANDERS	Thank you  thank you all very much.
0054	SANDERS	I'm running for president of the United States because given the crises facing our country, it is just too late for establishment politics and establishment economics.
0055	SANDERS	Together we're going to have to overturn this disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision.
0056	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0057	SANDERS	Billionaires and Wall Street should not be buying elections.
0058	SANDERS	We've got to end this rigged economy where people are working longer hours for low wages, almost all new income and wealth going to the top 1 percent, and of course, we need comprehensive immigration reform and a path toward citizenship.
0059	SANDERS	And here in Miami...
0060	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0061	SANDERS	...here in Miami as much as any city in America, we know that we have got to combat climate change, transform our energy system, and leave this planet in a way that is healthy and habitable for our kids and our grandchildren.
0062	SALINAS	Thank you, Senator.
0063	SALINAS	First question, Secretary, you have been starting to sound like the nominee lately, but many voters are saying, not so fast.
0064	SALINAS	Where did you fail last night in Michigan?
0065	CLINTON	Well, look, I won one of the contests and lost another close one.
0066	CLINTON	I am continuing to work hard for every single vote across our country.
0067	CLINTON	I was pleased that I got 100,000 more votes last night than my opponent and more delegates.
0068	CLINTON	So this is a marathon, and it's a marathon that can only be carried out by the kind of inclusive campaign that I'm running, a campaign that reaches out to everybody, a campaign that offers real positive solutions to the problems that we face, a campaign that is based on how together we can make progress, because I am a progressive who likes to get things done.
0069	CLINTON	So I'm excited about the upcoming contests, including right here in Florida.
0070	CLINTON	And we'll continue to work as hard as I can to earn the vote of every single voter.
0071	SALINAS	What went wrong in Michigan?
0072	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0073	SALINAS	What went wrong in Michigan?
0074	SALINAS	What went wrong in Michigan?
0075	SALINAS	What failed in Michigan specifically?
0076	CLINTON	It was a very close race.
0077	CLINTON	We've had some of those.
0078	CLINTON	I've won some.
0079	CLINTON	I've lost some.
0080	CLINTON	But, you know, I was very pleased by the overall outcome last night.
0081	CLINTON	And now we're on to the states for next Tuesday and I'm looking forward to campaigning hard in all of them.
0082	SALINAS	Senator, aside from your astounding upset last night in Michigan, you are still far behind Secretary Clinton in delegate count.
0083	SALINAS	She has 1,221 delegates, including superdelegates, and you have 571.
0084	SALINAS	What is your pathway to make up the deficit, and can you realistically catch up?
0085	SANDERS	Well, you know, when we began this campaign, I was 3% in the polls.
0086	SANDERS	I was probably 60 or 70 points behind the Secretary.
0087	SANDERS	We have come a long way in 10 months.
0088	SANDERS	We have won...
0089	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0090	SANDERS	...including Michigan last night, which some people,considered one of the major political upsets in modern American history.
0091	SANDERS	We have won nine state primaries and caucuses.
0092	SANDERS	And I believe that our message of the need for people to stand up and tell corporate America and Wall Street that they cannot have it all is resonating across this country.
0093	SANDERS	And I think in the coming weeks and months, we are going to continue to do extremely well, win a number of these primaries, and convince superdelegates that Bernie Sanders is the strongest candidate to defeat Donald Trump.
0094	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0095	RAMOS	Secretary Clinton, I want to disclose once again that my daughter Paula works for your campaign.
0096	RAMOS	And now I have a question about your emails.
0097	RAMOS	Your Republican opponents say that those emails have endangered our national security.
0098	RAMOS	When you were secretary of state, you wrote 104 emails in your private server that the government now says contain classified information according to The Washington Post analysis.
0099	RAMOS	That goes against a memo that you personally sent to your employees in 2011 directing all of them to use official email, precisely because of security concerns.
0100	RAMOS	So it seems that you issued one set of rules for yourself and a different set of rules for the rest of the State Department.
0101	RAMOS	So who specifically gave you permission to operate your email system as you did?
0102	RAMOS	Was it President Barack Obama?
0103	RAMOS	And would you drop out of the race if you get indicted?
0104	CLINTON	Well, Jorge, there's a lot of questions in there.
0105	CLINTON	And I'm going to give the same answer I've been giving for many months.
0106	CLINTON	It wasn't the best choice.
0107	CLINTON	I made a mistake.
0108	CLINTON	It was not prohibited.
0109	CLINTON	It was not in any way disallowed.
0110	CLINTON	And as I have said and as now has come out, my predecessors did the same thing and many other people in the government.
0111	CLINTON	But here's the cut to the chase facts.
0112	CLINTON	I did not send or receive any emails marked classified at the time.
0113	CLINTON	What you are talking about is retroactive classification.
0114	CLINTON	And the reason that happens is when somebody asks or when you are asked to make information public, I asked all my emails to be made public.
0115	CLINTON	Then all the rest of the government gets to weigh in.
0116	CLINTON	And some other parts of the government, we're not exactly sure who, has concluded that some of the emails should be now retroactively classified.
0117	CLINTON	They've just said the same thing to former Secretary Colin Powell.
0118	CLINTON	They have said, we're going to retroactively classify emails you sent personally.
0119	CLINTON	Now I think he was right when he said this is an absurdity.
0120	CLINTON	And I think that what we have got here is a case of overclassification.
0121	RAMOS	If we get your permission...
0122	CLINTON	I am not concerned about it.
0123	CLINTON	I am not worried about it and no Democrat or American should be either.
0124	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0125	RAMOS	Secretary Clinton, the questions were, who gave you permission to cooperate?
0126	RAMOS	Was it President Obama?
0127	CLINTON	There was no permission to be asked.
0128	CLINTON	It had been done by my predecessors.
0129	CLINTON	It was permitted.
0130	RAMOS	If you get indicted would you going to drop out?
0131	CLINTON	Oh, for goodness  that's not going to happen.
0132	CLINTON	I'm not even answering that question.
0133	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0134	RAMOS	Senator Sanders, you have gone from saying the following, the American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn e mails, to claiming that it is a very serious issue.
0135	RAMOS	Which is it?
0136	SANDERS	There is a process under way, and that process will take its course.
0137	SANDERS	Today in America, the middle class is disappearing.
0138	SANDERS	We have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, climate change threatens the whole planet, 47 million people live in poverty.
0139	SANDERS	I'm going to focus on the issues facing the working families of this country.
0140	SANDERS	That process specifically.
0141	TUMULTY	Secretary Clinton, you have known Donald Trump a long time.
0142	TUMULTY	You have seen what kind of campaign he's running.
0143	TUMULTY	Secretary Clinton, is Donald Trump a racist?
0144	CLINTON	Karen, I'm going to follow my friend Senator Sanders model here.
0145	CLINTON	If I'm so fortunate enough to be the Democratic nominee, there will be a lot of time to talk about him.
0146	CLINTON	I was the first one to call him out.
0147	CLINTON	I called him out when he was calling Mexicans rapists.
0148	CLINTON	When he was engaging in rhetoric that I found deeply offensive.
0149	CLINTON	I said basta, and I am pleased that others...
0150	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0151	CLINTON	...others are also joining in making clear that his rhetoric, his demagoguery, his trafficking in prejudice and paranoia has no place in our political system.
0152	CLINTON	Especially from somebody running for president who couldn't decide whether or not to disavow the Ku Klux Klan and David Duke.
0153	CLINTON	So people can draw their own conclusions about him.
0154	CLINTON	I will just end by saying this.
0155	CLINTON	You don't make America great by getting rid of everything that made America great.
0156	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0157	TUMULTY	Secretary Clinton, my question was about his character.
0158	TUMULTY	And that is one of the primary things that Americans think about when they choose their next president.
0159	TUMULTY	How would you describe the character of a person who has said the sorts of things he has about Mexican immigrants, about women, and who would ban people from entering this country based on their religion?
0160	CLINTON	I think it's unAmerican.
0161	CLINTON	I think what he has promoted is not at all in keeping with American values, Karen.
0162	CLINTON	And I am going to take every opportunity to criticize him, to raise those issues.
0163	CLINTON	I'm not going to engage in the kind of language that he uses.
0164	CLINTON	I think we can make the case against him if he is the nominee, by pointing out what he has said.
0165	CLINTON	What he claims to believe in The values he's promoting and I think that's a better way for the American people to draw their conclusions.
0166	TUMULTY	Senator Sanders, do you think it's fair to call Donald Trump a racist?
0167	SANDERS	This is what I think.
0168	SANDERS	I think that the American people are never going to elect a president who insults Mexicans, who insults Muslims, who insults women, who insults AfricanAmericans.
0169	SANDERS	And let us not forget that several years ago, Trump was in the middle of the so called birther movement, trying to delegitimize the president of the United States of America.
0170	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0171	SANDERS	You know, I find it very interesting, Karen, my dad was born in Poland.
0172	SANDERS	I know a little bit about the immigrant experience.
0173	SANDERS	Nobody has ever asked me for my birth certificate.
0174	SANDERS	Maybe it has something to do with the color of my skin.
0175	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0176	TUMULTY	So what does that tell you about his character?
0177	SANDERS	And I am very pleased  I am very pleased that I think in the last national poll that I saw, we were running 18 points ahead of Donald Trump.
0178	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0179	RAMOS	On
0180	SYSTEM	[ inaudible ]
0181	RAMOS	, people are talking about immigration, and this map shows where in the country they are talking about it the most.
0182	RAMOS	Maria Elena?
0183	SALINAS	So Secretary, I have a question for you.
0184	SALINAS	In 2003, you said on a radio show, specifically it was John Gambling's radio show in New York, that you were adamantly against illegal immigrants and that people have to stop employing illegal immigrants.
0185	SALINAS	Your new immigration plan is that you would expand President Obama's executive actions and that you would push for legislation that would include a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.
0186	SALINAS	So, are you flipflopping on this issue?
0187	SALINAS	Or are you pandering to Latinos, what some would call Hispandering?
0188	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
0189	CLINTON	In 2003, I sponsored the DREAMER Act.
0190	CLINTON	I sponsored I think in every Congress after that.
0191	CLINTON	I have been consistent and committed to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0192	CLINTON	I think our best chance was in 2007, when Ted Kennedy led the charge on comprehensive immigration reform.
0193	CLINTON	We have Republican support.
0194	CLINTON	We had a president willing to sign it.
0195	CLINTON	I voted for that bill.
0196	CLINTON	Senator Sanders voted against it.
0197	CLINTON	Just think, imagine where we would be today is we had achieved comprehensive immigration reform nine years ago.
0198	CLINTON	Imagine how much more secure families would be in our country, no longer fearing the deportation of a loved one no longer fearing that they would be found out.
0199	CLINTON	So I am staunchly in favor of comprehensive immigration reform and have been so over the course of my public career.
0200	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0201	SALINAS	Now, Senator Sanders, in 2007, you voted against immigration reform.
0202	SALINAS	You now say that it was because the bill had guestworker provisions which seemed semislavery.
0203	SALINAS	But back then, this is what you said to CNN's Lou Dobbs.
0204	SALINAS	Let's listen.
0205	SYSTEM	[ begin video clip ]
0206	SANDERS	Poverty is increasing.
0207	SANDERS	And if wages are going down, I don't know why we need millions of people to be coming into this country as guestworkers who will work for lower wages than American workers and drive wages down even lower than they are right now.
0208	SYSTEM	[ end video clip ]
0209	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
0210	SALINAS	So, Senator, were you concerned with working conditions for guestworkers, or really because you think immigrants drive down wages and take jobs from Americans?
0211	SANDERS	Well, you have guestworker programs that have been described by the Southern Poverty Law Center, one of the important institutions in this country who studies these issues, as guestworkers programs akin to slavery, where people came in.
0212	SANDERS	They were cheated.
0213	SANDERS	They were abused.
0214	SANDERS	They were humiliated.
0215	SANDERS	And if they stood up for their rights, they would be thrown out of the country.
0216	SANDERS	Of course, that type of
0217	SYSTEM	[ inaudible ]
0218	SANDERS	leads to a race to the bottom for all of our people.
0219	SANDERS	And I worked very hard on that issue.
0220	SANDERS	And of course, I supported the 2013 immigration reform bill.
0221	SANDERS	And what I believe right now is not only that we need comprehensive immigration reform, if the Congress does not do its job, as president of the United States I will use the executive powers of that office to do what has to be done, to do what President Obama did, and expand on that.
0222	SALINAS	But if you're saying that you would...
0223	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0224	SALINAS	...if you're saying that you would expand on the executive actions, how do you that they're not going to end up in a legal battle just like Obama's executive actions?
0225	SANDERS	Well, we do the best  we don't know.
0226	SANDERS	And I should also say with regard to that 2007 immigration bill, as you may know, LULAC, the major Hispanic organization in his country, also opposed that bill as did many other Latino organizations.
0227	SANDERS	But to your point, we have to do the best we can.
0228	SANDERS	I applaud President Obama for his efforts on DAPA and DACA.
0229	SANDERS	And I think we have got to expand those efforts.
0230	CLINTON	If I could...
0231	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0232	CLINTON	You know, I think it's very hard to make the case that Ted Kennedy, Barack Obama, me, La Raza, United Farmworkers, Dolores Huerta, leaders of the Latino community, would have supported a bill that actually promoted modern slavery.
0233	CLINTON	That was one of the many excuses used not to vote for the 2007 bill.
0234	CLINTON	And I will go back to what I said.
0235	CLINTON	If we had been able to get that passed, we would be so much further along now.
0236	CLINTON	I'm committed to defending DAPA and DACA.
0237	CLINTON	I'm committed to going even further to get more people deferred action, to go as far as I can under the law.
0238	CLINTON	And I am committed to introducing comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship in the first 100 days of my presidency.
0239	SALINAS	Secretary Sanders (sic).
0240	SALINAS	Senator, would you like to respond?
0241	SANDERS	Well, when we talk about efforts to assist immigrants, Secretary Clinton prevailed upon the governor of New York, Elliot Spitzer, who wanted to do the right thing and provide driver's license to these who were undocumented, she said don't do it, and New York State still does not do it.
0242	SANDERS	In Vermont, by the way, I worked with officials and undocumented people in Vermont do have the ability to get driver's license.
0243	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0244	SANDERS	When we talk about immigration, the secretary will remember that one of the great tragedies, human tragedies of recent years is children came from Honduras where there's probably more violence than almost any place in this country, and they came into this country.
0245	SANDERS	And I said welcome those children into this country, Secretary Clinton said send them back.
0246	SANDERS	That's a difference.
0247	CLINTON	Let me  let me respond again because the misrepresentation can't go unanswered here.
0248	CLINTON	First of all, that is something that is not fair about what I said.
0249	CLINTON	I did say we needed to be very concerned about little children coming to this country  on their own, very often  many of them not making it.
0250	CLINTON	And when they got here, they needed, as I have argued for, legal counsel, due process, to make a decision.
0251	CLINTON	We need to end private detention, we need to end family detention.
0252	CLINTON	And in 2006, when Senator Sanders was running for the Senate from Vermont, he voted in the House with hardline Republicans for indefinite detention for undocumented immigrants, and then he sided with those Republicans to stand with vigilantes known as Minute Men who were taking up outposts along the border to hunt down immigrants.
0253	CLINTON	So I think when you were running for the Senate, you made it clear by your vote, Senator, that you were going to stand with the Republicans.
0254	CLINTON	When you got to the Senate in 2007, one of the first things you did was vote against Ted Kennedy's immigration reform which he'd been working on for years before you ever arrived.
0255	SALINAS	One last response.
0256	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0257	SANDERS	Let me respond  let me respond to that.
0258	SALINAS	Go ahead.
0259	SANDERS	You know, Ted Kennedy was a very close friend of mine, and I served on the committee he chaired, the Health, Education, Labor Committee.
0260	SANDERS	And Ted Kennedy was kind enough to allow me to hold a hearing in 2008, I believe, in Congress, dealing with the plight of undocumented tomato pickers in Immokalee, Florida.
0261	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0262	SANDERS	And I went there on my own.
0263	SANDERS	Wasn't an issue really for the state of Vermont to expose the horrendous working conditions and the semi slavery, if you like, that those workers lived under.
0264	SANDERS	And the result of that hearing and the work that many, many people did was to significantly improve the wages and working conditions of those workers.
0265	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0266	RAMOS	Senator, Secretary, we're going to take a break and we'll continue talking about immigration when we come back.
0267	CLINTON	Great.
0268	CLINTON	Thank you.
0269	CLINTON	RAMOS
0270	SYSTEM	[ through translator ]
0271	RAMOS	So this is the moment of talking about deportations.
0272	RAMOS	We're going to immigrants.
0273	SYSTEM	[ through translator ]
0274	SYSTEM	[ inaudible ] Facebook page [ inaudible ]
0275	SALINAS	Tell us what you think of the debate in the comment section.
0276	SALINAS	We will come back after the break.
0277	SYSTEM	[ commercial break ]
0278	SYSTEM	[ through translator ]
0279	RAMOS	We're back to the Democratic debate.
0280	RAMOS	Secretary Clinton, the last time we talked in January, in Iowa, I asked you if you could be the next deporting chief.
0281	RAMOS	And you told me, no, that you wouldn't be the next deporter in chief.
0282	RAMOS	However, you refused two times to say you would not deport children.
0283	RAMOS	This is what you said.
0284	SYSTEM	[ begin video clip ]
0285	RAMOS	And can you promise that you won't deport immigrants who don't have a criminal record?
0286	CLINTON	Here's what I can promise Jorge, I can promise that I will do everything possible to provide due process.
0287	RAMOS	But will you deport children?
0288	CLINTON	Let me say this.
0289	CLINTON	I would give every person, but particularly children, due process to have their story told.
0290	CLINTON	And a lot of children will, of course, have very legitimate stories under our law to be able to stay.
0291	SYSTEM	[ end video clip ]
0292	RAMOS	So secretary, you seem to be defending President Obama's deportation policy.
0293	RAMOS	And as you know, so far he has deported more than 2.5 million immigrants.
0294	RAMOS	So if you really don't want to be the next deporter in chief, can you promise tonight that you won't deport children and that you won't deport immigrants who don't have a criminal record and this time, could I get a yes or no answer?
0295	CLINTON	Yes, you can because the question you were asking me were about children seeking asylum.
0296	CLINTON	And we have laws.
0297	CLINTON	That was the most critical thing I said.
0298	CLINTON	Under our laws.
0299	CLINTON	I would like to see those laws changed.
0300	CLINTON	I would like see added to them, a guaranteed counsel and other support for children.
0301	CLINTON	But if you are asking about everyone who is already here, undocumented immigrants, the 1112 million who are living here, my priorities are to deport violent criminals, terrorists, and anyone who threatens our safety.
0302	CLINTON	So I do not have the same policy as the current administration does.
0303	CLINTON	I think it's important that we move to our comprehensive immigration reform, but at the same time, stop the raids, stop the roundups, stop the deporting of people who are living here doing their lives, doing their jobs, and that's my priority.
0304	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0305	RAMOS	But again, yes or no, can you promise tonight that you won't deport children, children who are already here?
0306	CLINTON	I will not deport children.
0307	CLINTON	I would not deport children.
0308	CLINTON	I do not want to deport family members either, Jorge.
0309	CLINTON	I want to, as I said, prioritize who would be deported violent criminals, people planning terrorist attacks, anybody who threatens us.
0310	CLINTON	That's a relatively small universe.
0311	RAMOS	OK.
0312	RAMOS	So I want to be very specific.
0313	RAMOS	So you are telling us tonight that if you become president you won't deport children who are already here?
0314	CLINTON	I will not.
0315	RAMOS	And that you won't deport immigrants who don't have a criminal record?
0316	CLINTON	That's what I'm telling you.
0317	CLINTON	Now I don't want  because I'm not contradicting what I told you in the interview.
0318	CLINTON	Asylum is a particular legal process.
0319	CLINTON	I'd like to see it changed.
0320	CLINTON	I'd like to see us give more support to people who come fleeing the terrible violence that they do.
0321	CLINTON	But under our law, we have a process we have to go through which is different.
0322	RAMOS	So you will stop those deportations.
0323	CLINTON	I would stop...
0324	RAMOS	The deportations for children...
0325	CLINTON	Yes.
0326	RAMOS	... and those who don't have a criminal record.
0327	CLINTON	Of the people, the undocumented people living in our country, I do not want to see them deported.
0328	CLINTON	I want to see them on a path to citizenship.
0329	CLINTON	That is exactly what I will do.
0330	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0331	RAMOS	Senator Sanders, would you  can you promise us tonight that you won't deport children?
0332	SANDERS	Let me just say this.
0333	SANDERS	I don't think that the secretary fully answered your question, and I think the proof may be in the pudding.
0334	SANDERS	Honduras and that region of the world may be the most violent region in our hemisphere.
0335	SANDERS	Gang lords, vicious people torturing people, doing horrible things to families.
0336	SANDERS	Children fled that part of the world to try, try, try, try, maybe, to meet up with their family members in this country, taking a route that was horrific, trying to start a new life.
0337	SANDERS	Secretary Clinton did not support those children coming into this country.
0338	SANDERS	I did.
0339	SANDERS	Now I happen to agree with President Obama on many, many issues.
0340	SANDERS	I think he has done a great job as president of the United States.
0341	SANDERS	He is wrong on this issue of deportation.
0342	SANDERS	I disagree with him on that.
0343	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0344	SANDERS	So to answer your question, no, I will not deport children from the United States of America.
0345	RAMOS	And can you promise not to deport immigrants who don't have a criminal record?
0346	SANDERS	I can make that promise.
0347	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0348	CLINTON	This is why I go back to that 2007 vote because if we had been successful then, a lot of the issues we are still discussing today would be in the rearview mirror.
0349	CLINTON	I want us to be able to achieve comprehensive immigration reform if I'm so fortunate enough to be president.
0350	CLINTON	And we do have to take a look at asylum laws.
0351	CLINTON	When I was secretary of state, I worked to try to support many different approaches to ending the violence in Central America.
0352	CLINTON	I was there meeting with leaders, security leaders, and others.
0353	CLINTON	And I think the Congress should support the president's request to fund programs that would protect people and change the culture of criminality and violence in Central America, helping people be able to stay safely in their homes and countries.
0354	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0355	SANDERS	Let me just answer, I want to get back to this 2007 immigration bill.
0356	SANDERS	It's true, Ted Kennedy, a good friend of mine, and I think of the secretary's, did work very hard on that bill.
0357	SANDERS	But does anyone really believe that if that bill was all so good, as the secretary is touting, that LULAC and other major Latino organizations, the largest Latino organizations in this country said no to that bill.
0358	SANDERS	And I worked very hard in improving the guest worker provisions so that in 2013 a bill I strongly supported, people who were in the guest worker program in America would not be treated like slaves.
0359	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0360	CLINTON	Let me just conclude by saying that United Farm Workers considered that bill in their words the last best hope for farm workers and immigrants.
0361	CLINTON	They have proven to be right in the succeeding years.
0362	CLINTON	I only hope that we can put together a coalition to pass comprehensive immigration reform in the next Congress.
0363	CLINTON	And as I said earlier, in 2006, Senator Sanders supported indefinite detention for people facing deportation...
0364	SANDERS	It's...
0365	CLINTON	...and stood with the Minutemen vigilantes in their ridiculous, absurd efforts to, quote, "hunt down immigrants.
0366	CLINTON	So look, I think the goal here is to elect a Democratic Senate, elect a Democratic president and get to work immediately to get comprehensive immigration reform.
0367	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0368	RAMOS	Did you support the Minutemen, Senator?
0369	RAMOS	Did you support the Minutemen?
0370	SANDERS	I'm sorry?
0371	RAMOS	Did you support the Minutemen, as Secretary Clinton has said?
0372	SANDERS	Of course not.
0373	SANDERS	There was a piece of legislation supported by dozens and dozens of members of the House which codified existing legislation.
0374	SANDERS	What the secretary is doing tonight and has done very often is take large pieces of legislation and take pieces out of it.
0375	SANDERS	No, I did not oppose the bailout or the support of the automobile industry.
0376	SANDERS	No, I do not support vigilantes, and that is a horrific statement, an unfair statement to make.
0377	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0378	SANDERS	I will stand
0379	SYSTEM	[ inaudible ]
0380	SANDERS	of my career, political career fighting for workers, fighting for the poorest people in this country.
0381	SANDERS	Madame Secretary, I will match my record against yours any day of the week.
0382	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0383	CLINTON	Well, let's do that.
0384	CLINTON	Let's talk about that.
0385	CLINTON	Let's talk about that.
0386	RAMOS	Secretary, you said this morning...
0387	CLINTON	Let's talk about the auto bailout because I think it's important for people to understand what happened.
0388	CLINTON	In December of 2008, we were both in the Senate, there was a vote on a freestanding bill to rescue the auto industry.
0389	CLINTON	We both voted for it.
0390	CLINTON	was the right vote.
0391	CLINTON	Unfortunately, it did not succeed.
0392	CLINTON	The Republicans marshalled the votes against it.
0393	CLINTON	A month later, in January, a new piece of legislation was offered that contained the money that would be used for the auto rescue.
0394	CLINTON	Then Presidentelect Obama  before he'd even been sworn in  sent word to all of us that he really hoped we would support it.
0395	CLINTON	He was still in the Senate, I was still in the Senate.
0396	CLINTON	And I voted for it.
0397	CLINTON	It was a hard vote.
0398	CLINTON	I'll tell you, it was a hard vote.
0399	CLINTON	A lot of the votes you make are hard votes.
0400	CLINTON	But the fact is the money that rescued the auto industry was in that bill.
0401	SALINAS	Secretary...
0402	CLINTON	Now, Senator Sanders voted against it.
0403	CLINTON	That's his perfect right to vote against it.
0404	CLINTON	But if everyone had voted as he voted...
0405	RAMOS	OK, Senator.
0406	SANDERS	Yeah, let me...
0407	CLINTON	... we would not have rescued the auto industry.
0408	RAMOS	You have 30 seconds and then we'll pass to another.
0409	RAMOS	Thirty more seconds and then we'll move to another...
0410	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0411	SANDERS	Let me  let's  so that everybody knows, the bill that Secretary Clinton is talking about, that is  that was the bailout of the recklessness, irresponsibility and illegal behavior of Wall Street.
0412	SANDERS	It was the Wall Street bailout.
0413	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0414	SANDERS	And I find it interesting that when Secretary Clinton, who was the former senator of New York, of course, when she defended her vote, she said, well, it's going to help the big banks in New York.
0415	SANDERS	Those are my constituents.
0416	SANDERS	And then you go to Detroit and suddenly this legislation helps the automobile workers.
0417	SANDERS	There was an article just yesterday...
0418	SALINAS	Your time is up, Senator.
0419	SANDERS	... where people like Senator Bayh and Ron Wyden, Byron Dorgan...
0420	SALINAS	Senator  your time is up, Senator.
0421	SANDERS	...former senators said, no, this wasn't the automobile bailout.
0422	SANDERS	It was the bailout of Wall Street.
0423	RAMOS	Thank you.
0424	SALINAS	We have to move on.
0425	SALINAS	Senator, the time is up.
0426	SALINAS	We have to move on.
0427	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0428	SALINAS	Next question.
0429	SALINAS	Secretary Clinton, you recently said instead of building walls we need to tear down barriers.
0430	SALINAS	However, last November in New Hampshire, you openly said that as senator you voted numerous times to build the wall with Mexico.
0431	SALINAS	What's the difference between what you did, voting to build the wall, and what Donald Trump wants to do now?
0432	CLINTON	Well, I think both of us, both Senator Sanders and I, voted numerous times to enhance border security along our border.
0433	CLINTON	We increased the number of border security agents.
0434	CLINTON	We did vote for money to build a fence, a pedestrian fence in some place, a vehicle fence in other places.
0435	CLINTON	And the result is that we have the most secure border we've ever had.
0436	CLINTON	Apprehensions coming across the border are the lowest they've been in 40 years, which just strengthens my argument that now it's time to do comprehensive immigration reform.
0437	CLINTON	The Republicans, the opponents no longer have an argument.
0438	CLINTON	And certainly, we hear a lot coming from the Republican side that is absolutely out of touch with reality.
0439	CLINTON	We raised money through the congressional appropriations process.
0440	CLINTON	We enhanced the border security.
0441	CLINTON	That part of the work is done.
0442	CLINTON	Everybody that I know has looked at it said, okay, we have a secure border.
0443	CLINTON	There's no need for this rhetoric and demagoguery that's still is carried out on the Republican side.
0444	CLINTON	You've run out of excuses.
0445	CLINTON	Let's move to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.
0446	CLINTON	And I think that makes a very strong argument in favor of doing it.
0447	SALINAS	But the question is, what is the difference between the wall that you voted for and Donald Trump's wall?
0448	CLINTON	It's a big difference.
0449	CLINTON	First of all, as I understand him, he's talking about a very tall wall.
0450	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
0451	CLINTON	Right?
0452	CLINTON	A beautiful tall wall.
0453	CLINTON	The most beautiful tall wall, better than the Great Wall of China, that would run the entire border.
0454	CLINTON	That he would somehow magically get the Mexican government to pay for.
0455	CLINTON	And, you know, it's just fantasy.
0456	CLINTON	And in fact, if he cared to know anything about what members of Congress, like the senator and I have done, where it was necessary, we did support some fencing.
0457	CLINTON	Where it was necessary, we did add border patrol agents.
0458	CLINTON	We have done what by any fair estimate would have to conclude is a good job, quote, "securing the border".
0459	CLINTON	So let's get about the business of comprehensive immigration reform.
0460	SANDERS	Let me just say...
0461	SALINAS	Senator...
0462	SANDERS	I think the secretary and I mostly, I think, agree on this issue.
0463	SANDERS	Look, in this country, immigration reform is a very hot debate.
0464	SANDERS	It's divided the country.
0465	SANDERS	But I would hope very much, that as we have that debate, we do not, as Donald Trump and others have done, resort to racism and xenophobia and bigotry.
0466	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0467	SANDERS	This idea of suddenly, one day or maybe a night, rounding up 11 million people and taking them outside of this country is a vulgar, absurd idea that I would hope very few people in America support.
0468	TUMULTY	Your time is up, senator.
0469	TUMULTY	Thank you.
0470	SALINAS	Now we have a question from the audience for both of you.
0471	SYSTEM	[ through translator ]
0472	QUESTION	We have a question from the public.
0473	QUESTION	I want to go to Lucia Aquiette.
0474	QUESTION	She's an immigrant from Guatemala, she's here with her five children who have not seen their father since he was deported three years ago.
0475	QUESTION	She has a question for both of you.
0476	SYSTEM	[ through translator ]
0477	QUESTION	I would like to ask  me and my children  hardworking men in the field 
0478	SYSTEM	[ inaudible ]
0479	QUESTION	Senator Sanders, as you can see, these are a very painful and personal issue for Lucia and her family.
0480	QUESTION	She wants to know what you would do to stop deportations, but most importantly, to reunite families like hers.
0481	SANDERS	Well, I absolutely support that.
0482	SANDERS	At the heart of my immigration policy and I should say that the New York times editorial board called my immigration policy the most progressive and the strongest of any candidate running.
0483	SANDERS	But to answer your question, the essence of what we are trying to do is to unite families, not to divide families.
0484	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0485	SANDERS	The idea that a mother is living here and her children are on the other side of the border is wrong and immoral.
0486	SANDERS	A number of months ago, I talked to a young man who was serving in the United States military and while he was serving in the military, his wife was deported.
0487	SANDERS	That is beyond comprehension and policies that should not be allowed to exist.
0488	SANDERS	So, ma'am, I will do everything that I can to unite your family.
0489	SANDERS	Your children deserve to be with their mother.
0490	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0491	RAMOS	Thank you Senator Sanders.
0492	SYSTEM	[ through translator ]
0493	QUESTION	Secretary Clinton, you've also said you want to stop deportations.
0494	QUESTION	But what's your plan to reunite families and thousands of children, U.S. citizens, with their parents?
0495	CLINTON	First of all, please know how brave I think you are, coming here with your children to tell your story.
0496	CLINTON	This is an incredible act of courage that I'm not sure many people really understand.
0497	CLINTON	And I want you to know that in the work that I've done and the many families that I've met, I have heard similar stories like yours, where your husband is deported.
0498	CLINTON	Your children's father is gone.
0499	CLINTON	You are doing your very best to support your children.
0500	CLINTON	But it is time to bring families together.
0501	CLINTON	And I don't think there's any doubt that we must do more to let stories like yours be heard more widely so that more Americans know what the human cost of these policies are.
0502	CLINTON	And I will do everything I can to prevent other families from facing what you are facing.
0503	CLINTON	And I will do everything I can to pass laws that would bring families back together.
0504	CLINTON	And I hope that your children are all either citizens born in this country or eligible for the programs that President Obama has put into place, DACA and DAPA, because I will defend those and I will absolutely protect your children, yourself, and try to bring your family back together.
0505	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0506	QUESTION	Secretary Clinton, thank you.
0507	QUESTION	Secretary Clinton, they are U.S. citizens
0508	SYSTEM	[ inaudible ]
0509	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0510	QUESTION	Thank you.
0511	QUESTION	Now let's go back to Karen.
0512	TUMULTY	Thank you, Enrique.
0513	TUMULTY	Secretary Clinton, a Washington Post poll just yesterday found that only 37 percent of Americans consider you honest and trustworthy.
0514	TUMULTY	Now, when you've been asked about this in the past, you have said that this is the result of many, many years of Republican attacks upon you.
0515	TUMULTY	But Americans have also had 25  more than that  years to get to know you for themselves.
0516	TUMULTY	Is there anything in your own actions and the decisions that you yourself have made that would foster this kind of mistrust?
0517	CLINTON	Well, first Karen, obviously it's painful for me to hear that.
0518	CLINTON	And I do take responsibility.
0519	CLINTON	When you're in public life, even if you believe that it's not an opinion that you think is fair or founded, you do have to take responsibility.
0520	CLINTON	And I do.
0521	CLINTON	And I also have, you know, very much committed to the best of my ability my energies and efforts to helping people.
0522	CLINTON	That's something that I care deeply about.
0523	CLINTON	And I will continue to do that, to demonstrate by my past actions and my present levels of commitment and plans that people can count on me.
0524	CLINTON	That is certainly what happened to me in New York, where people got to know me.
0525	CLINTON	They saw me in action.
0526	CLINTON	And they did.
0527	CLINTON	Look, I have said before and it won't surprise anybody to hear me say it, this is not easy for me.
0528	CLINTON	It's not easy to do what I think is right, to help people, to even the odds, to hear a story like the woman's story we just heard.
0529	CLINTON	And to know that I can make a difference and I want to in every way possible.
0530	CLINTON	I am not a natural politician, in case you haven't noticed, like my husband or President Obama.
0531	CLINTON	So I have a view that I just have to do the best I can, get the results I can, make a difference in people's lives, and hope that people see that I'm fighting for them and that I can improve conditions economically and other ways that will benefit them and their families.
0532	TUMULTY	Thank you.
0533	TUMULTY	Thank you.
0534	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0535	TUMULTY	Senator Sanders, you have demanded that Secretary Clinton release the transcripts of her paid Wall Street speeches.
0536	TUMULTY	Why is this important?
0537	TUMULTY	Do you have reason to believe that she says one thing in private and another in public?
0538	SANDERS	Well, what I have said is that when you get I believe it is $225,000 for giving a speech, and she gave several speeches to Goldman Sachs, one of the Wall Street financial institutions whose greed and illegal behavior helped destroy our economy a number of years ago, when you get paid $225,000, that means that that speech must have been an extraordinarily wonderful speech.
0539	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0540	TUMULTY	So does this mean that you would not think she should have to disclose...
0541	SANDERS	I would think that a speech so great that you got paid so much money for, you would like to share it with the American people.
0542	SANDERS	So I think she should release the transcript.
0543	SYSTEM	[ laughter and applause ]
0544	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
0545	SANDERS	As the secretary said, well, she will do it if other people do it.
0546	SANDERS	I will do it.
0547	SANDERS	I didn't give any speeches, there is no transcript.
0548	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0549	TUMULTY	But my question was, do you think she saying one thing in the speeches and another in public?
0550	SANDERS	That is exactly what releasing the transcripts will tell us.
0551	SANDERS	This I do know.
0552	SANDERS	This I do know.
0553	SANDERS	There is a reason why Wall Street has provided $15 million just in the last reporting period to the secretary's super PAC.
0554	SANDERS	Now, the secretary says it doesn't influence her.
0555	SANDERS	Well, that's what every politician says who gets money from special interests.
0556	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0557	SANDERS	The question that the American people have to determine  you know, can you say that Wall Street is greedy, they're fraudulent, but they're not dumb.
0558	SANDERS	Why are they making those kind of large contributions?
0559	TUMULTY	Thank you, your time is up.
0560	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0561	CLINTON	Well, let me respond, as I have numerous times during this campaign.
0562	CLINTON	You know, I have a public record and you can go look it up.
0563	CLINTON	I went to Wall Street before the Great Recession and basically called them out, said that their behavior was putting our economy at risk, called for a moratorium on foreclosures.
0564	CLINTON	I went to the Orlando area during the '08 campaign to make the same case, visiting with families who had been defrauded by mortgages, these subprime mortgages that put them and their homes at risk.
0565	TUMULTY	Thank you, Secretary Clinton.
0566	CLINTON	I called for those changes.
0567	CLINTON	I have been on the record and now I do have the toughest, most comprehensive plan to go after Wall Street.
0568	CLINTON	And not just the big banks, all the other financial interests that pose a threat to our economy.
0569	CLINTON	And I have said no bank is too big to fail and no executive is too powerful to jail, and I will use the powers that have now been passed by the Congress, by President Obama, who, incidentally, took a lot of money from Wall Street, which didn't stop him from signing into law the toughest regulations on the financial industry since the Great Depression.
0570	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0571	SANDERS	Look, clearly, clearly, the secretary's words to Wall Street has really intimidated them, and that is why they have given her $15 million in campaign contributions.
0572	TUMULTY	Thank you, Senator.
0573	SANDERS	Now, what I believe is in fact that we have a corrupt campaign finance system.
0574	SANDERS	And it's not just Wall Street, it's the drug companies,
0575	SYSTEM	[ inaudible ]
0576	SANDERS	received millions of dollars from the fossil fuel industry.
0577	SANDERS	We've got to overturn Citizens United and end that.
0578	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0579	CLINTON	Wait a minute.
0580	CLINTON	I just think it's worth pointing out that the leaders of the fossil fuel industry, the Koch brothers, have just paid to put up an ad praising Senator Sanders.
0581	CLINTON	There are a lot of different powerful interests in Washington.
0582	CLINTON	I've taken them on.
0583	CLINTON	I took on the drug companies.
0584	CLINTON	I took on the insurance companies.
0585	CLINTON	Before there was something called Obamacare, there was something called Hillarycare, and I worked really hard...
0586	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0587	CLINTON	...to get comprehensive health care reform, and they beat me.
0588	CLINTON	So I have a long record of standing up to special interests.
0589	CLINTON	And I will continue to do so.
0590	RAMOS	We're going to move on to the next question.
0591	SYSTEM	[ booing ] [ crosstalk ]
0592	SYSTEM	[ laughter and applause ]
0593	RAMOS	You have 30 seconds, Senator.
0594	SANDERS	There is nobody in the United States Congress who has taken on the Koch brothers, who want to destroy Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and virtually every federal program passed since the 1930s more that Bernie Sanders.
0595	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0596	SANDERS	And I am proud that the gentleman who is head of Goldman Sachs, now, he didn't give me $225,000 for speaking fees, he said I was dangerous and he's right.
0597	SANDERS	I am dangerous for Wall Street.
0598	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0599	CLINTON	Well, if I can say...
0600	RAMOS	We're going to move on to the secretary.
0601	CLINTON	... you know though, I guess Senator Sanders, that the Koch brothers, as you said, are sensible with how they use their money.
0602	CLINTON	And I agree with you.
0603	CLINTON	They stand for things that I find abhorrent, that would be bad for our country, bad for our future.
0604	CLINTON	But they did just put up a little video praising you for being the only Democrat who stood with the Republicans to try to eliminate the ExportImport Bank, which has helped hundreds and hundreds of companies here in Florida be able to export their goods and employ more Floridians.
0605	CLINTON	So from my perspective, you sided with the Koch brothers.
0606	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0607	SANDERS	Let me respond.
0608	RAMOS	Yes.
0609	RAMOS	Just a few seconds.
0610	SANDERS	The ExportImport Bank is often called the bank of Boeing, because Boeing corporation gets 40 percent of the revenue.
0611	RAMOS	OK. We're going to move on.
0612	SANDERS	It is corporate welfare and yes, I oppose corporate welfare.
0613	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0614	RAMOS	OK, next question.
0615	RAMOS	I want to continue with the issue of trust.
0616	RAMOS	Secretary Clinton, on the night of the attacks in Benghazi, you sent an email to your daughter Chelsea...
0617	SYSTEM	[ booing ]
0618	RAMOS	...saying, that Al Qaida was responsible for the killing of the Americans.
0619	SYSTEM	[ booing ]
0620	RAMOS	However, some of the families claim that you lied to them.
0621	RAMOS	To that speed, the mother of the information officer, Chaznea.
0622	RAMOS	Let's listen.
0623	SYSTEM	[ begin video clip ]
0624	SMITH	Hillary and Obama and Panetta and Biden and all of  and Susan Rice, all told me it was a video, when they knew it was not the video.
0625	SMITH	And they said that they would call me and let me know what the outcome was.
0626	SYSTEM	[ end video clip ]
0627	RAMOS	Secretary Clinton, did you lie to them?
0628	CLINTON	You know, look.
0629	CLINTON	I feel a great deal of sympathy for the families of the four brave Americans that we lost at Benghazi.
0630	CLINTON	And I certainly can't even imagine the grief that she has for losing her son, but she's wrong.
0631	CLINTON	She's absolutely wrong.
0632	CLINTON	I and everybody in the administration, all the people she named, the president, the vice president, Susan Rice, we were scrambling to get information that was changing, literally by the hour.
0633	CLINTON	And when we had information, we made it public.
0634	CLINTON	But then sometimes we had to go back and say we have new information that contradicts it.
0635	CLINTON	So I testified for 11 hours.
0636	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0637	CLINTON	Anybody who watched that and listened to it knows that I answered every question that I was asked and when it was over the Republicans had to admit they didn't learn anything.
0638	CLINTON	Why?
0639	CLINTON	Because there had already been one independent investigation.
0640	CLINTON	There had been seven or eight congressional investigations, mostly led by Republicans who all reached the same conclusions, that there were lessons to be learned.
0641	CLINTON	And this is not the first time we lost Americans in a terrorist attack.
0642	CLINTON	We lost 3,000 people on 911.
0643	CLINTON	We lost Americans serving in embassies in Tanzania and Kenya when my husband was president.
0644	CLINTON	We lost 250 Americans, both military and civilian, when Ronald Reagan was president in Beirut.
0645	CLINTON	And at no other time were those tragedies were they politicized
0646	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0647	CLINTON	Instead people said, let's learn the lessons and save lives.
0648	CLINTON	And that's when I did.
0649	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0650	RAMOS	But Secretary Clinton, what they're saying is that  what the families are saying is that you told your daughter Chelsea one thing and a different thing to them.
0651	CLINTON	Jorge, that makes my point.
0652	CLINTON	At the time I emailed with my daughter, a terrorist group had taken credit for the attacks on our facility in Benghazi.
0653	CLINTON	Within 16, 18 hours, they rescinded taking credit.
0654	CLINTON	They did it all on social media.
0655	CLINTON	And the video did play a role.
0656	CLINTON	We have captured one of the lead terrorists and he admits it was both a terrorist attack and it was influenced by the video.
0657	CLINTON	This was fog of war.
0658	CLINTON	This was complicated.
0659	CLINTON	The most effective, comprehensive reports and studies demonstrate that.
0660	CLINTON	Look, as I said in the beginning, I deeply regret that we lost four Americans.
0661	RAMOS	Thank you senator.
0662	CLINTON	And I of course sympathize with members of the families who are still, you know, very much grieving.
0663	CLINTON	And I wish that there could be an easy answer at the time, but we learned a lot, and the intelligence kept...
0664	RAMOS	Thank you.
0665	CLINTON	... improving, and we learned enough to say what we think happened at Benghazi.
0666	RAMOS	You have 30 seconds, Senator.
0667	SANDERS	Well, I'm not going to comment on the Benghazi tragedy, but I will say this.
0668	SANDERS	A series of articles in the New York Times talked about Secretary Clinton's role in urging the administration to go forward with regime change, getting rid of Gadhafi in Libya.
0669	SANDERS	Gadhafi was a brutal dictator, there's no question.
0670	SANDERS	But one of the differences between the secretary and I is I'm not quite so aggressive with regard to regime change.
0671	SANDERS	I voted against the war in Iraq because I had a fear of what would happen the day after.
0672	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0673	SANDERS	And Secretary Clinton talks about Henry Kissinger...
0674	RAMOS	Thank you, Senator.
0675	SANDERS	... winning the praise of Henry Kissinger, I don't want Henry Kissinger's praise at all.
0676	SYSTEM	[ applause ]

0696	SALINAS	Good evening, good evening.
0697	SALINAS	We heard a lot about immigration, about the deportations and race.
0698	SALINAS	In your opinion, who
0699	SYSTEM	[ inaudible ]
0700	SALINAS	better and who presented the immigration proposal?
0701	SYSTEM	[ through translator ]
0702	QUESTION	The two candidates did a good action of talking, explaining, but what concerned me a bit is that we  we haven't seen the plan of Senator Bernie Sanders, and we have not seen a plan in writing from Secretary Hillary Clinton.
0703	QUESTION	So we want to see what she says.
0704	QUESTION	That is important,
0705	QUESTION	The six months  that we have seen as immigration is concerned, and we see that they're moving towards.
0706	QUESTION	The community needs to not only immigration reform, but the raids have to stop.
0707	QUESTION	Families that we have seen that are suffering, they have to be reunited.

0714	QUESTION	And those children suffering because they do not have their father.
0715	QUESTION	And this is what we see that is happening, that Republicans are doing not  by not approving a migratory reform, but also President Obama.

0723	SALINAS	We'll continue with the debate now.
0724	SALINAS	Senator Sanders, you call your opponent Hillary Clinton an establishment politician.
0725	SALINAS	You yourself are a career politician.
0726	SALINAS	Why should voters prefer a career politicians over an establishment politician?
0727	SANDERS	Well, you've got to look at what the career is about.
0728	SANDERS	And this is a career that has stood up to every special interest in this country.
0729	SANDERS	I don't take money from Wall Street.
0730	SANDERS	I demand that we break up the large financial institutions.
0731	SANDERS	I don't take money from the pharmaceutical industry because I believe they are ripping off the American people and charging us the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.
0732	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0733	SANDERS	I don't take money from the fossil fuel industry because they are destroying  they are destroying this planet through their emissions of carbon and creating the terrible climate change that we are seeing.
0734	SANDERS	So I think it is true that I have served in Congress for many years.
0735	SANDERS	But if you check my record, it is a record of strength for the environment, for workers, for seniors.
0736	SANDERS	Unlike the secretary, I believe we should expand Social Security benefits.
0737	SANDERS	It is a record of achievement for veterans, working with Republicans, helping to craft the most significant veterans healthcare bill passed in many decades.
0738	SANDERS	So I think the point is look at the record, and it's a record that I am proud of.
0739	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0740	SALINAS	Secretary,
0741	SYSTEM	[ inaudible ]
0742	SALINAS	Latinos, according to the UnivisionWashington Post poll, the number one issue is jobs and the economy.
0743	SALINAS	Latino unemployment rate is higher than the national average.
0744	SALINAS	Their net worth has gone down 42 percent during the Obama years, and 60 percent of Latinos make less than $15 an hour.
0745	SALINAS	So, last week you tweeted that for the GOP, the economy is an after thought.
0746	SALINAS	Well, many Latinos feel that they are an after thought.
0747	SALINAS	Do you understand what the specific needs of Latinos are to improve their living conditions?
0748	CLINTON	Well, I certainly know what all Americans need, and that is more jobs, with rising incomes.
0749	CLINTON	It's something that I have worked on for many years.
0750	CLINTON	It's why I've laid down the only really comprehensive plan about how to create more good jobs.
0751	CLINTON	And there are several things that need to be addressed.
0752	CLINTON	We do have to do more infrastructure spending.
0753	CLINTON	That will put many Americans to work.
0754	CLINTON	It's a good job that gets you on the ladder to the middle class.
0755	CLINTON	We need to improve the conditions for manufacturing in our country and punish those companies that want to export jobs.
0756	CLINTON	We need them to be incentivized to create jobs right here in America.
0757	CLINTON	We also do have to combat climate change, and no state has more at stake in that than Florida.
0758	CLINTON	And the best way to do that is not only enforcing the laws we have, but also the clean power plan that President Obama has put forth that I support, and the Paris agreement that I think was a huge step forward in the world, that Senator Sanders said was too weak, but I helped to lay the groundwork for that.
0759	CLINTON	But we need more clean energy jobs and we have to do more to help small businesses.
0760	CLINTON	You know, the fastestgrowing segment of small businesses are minority and womenowned small business, and we need to help businesses get started.
0761	CLINTON	The very distinguished congresswoman from New York who's been on the Small Business Committee, Congresswoman Velasquez, knows exactly what we need to be doing to create more small businesses.
0762	CLINTON	We do need to raise the minimum wage and we have to guarantee equal pay for women.
0763	SALINAS	Secretary, what would you do...
0764	CLINTON	That will help Latinos as well as every other working person in our country.
0765	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0766	SALINAS	Secretary, you talked in general terms, but you haven't really said what you would specifically do to improve the living conditions of Latinos.
0767	CLINTON	Everything I just said will improve the living conditions, and I've spent a lot of time and effort talking to and mostly listening to Latinos.
0768	CLINTON	Jobs are the number one issue, with rising incomes.
0769	CLINTON	Close behind is education.
0770	CLINTON	Every child deserves a good teacher in a good school, regardless of the zip code that they live in.
0771	CLINTON	Following behind that is health care and how important it is to continue to build on the Affordable Care Act and provide access to health care.
0772	CLINTON	And then there are a number of other issues  comprehensive immigration reform certainly at the top.
0773	SALINAS	Your time is up, Secretary  sorry, your time is up.
0774	SANDERS	OK, let me answer that question because it's a huge question.
0775	SANDERS	And one of the  huge, I know.
0776	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
0777	SANDERS	One of the points that I've been making, and media does not seem to pick up on it, is that we have a real crisis not only with real unemployment in America being close to 10 percent, but youth unemployment in this country.
0778	SANDERS	If you look at Latino kids between 17 and 20 who graduated high school, 36 percent of them are unemployed or underemployed...
0779	SALINAS	Your time is up.
0780	SANDERS	Oh wait a minute.
0781	SANDERS	Can I have...
0782	RAMOS	Go ahead.
0783	SANDERS	... a little bit of time here please?
0784	SANDERS	AfricanAmerican kids are unemployed or underemployed to the tune of 51 percent.
0785	SANDERS	That's why I cosponsored legislation to put $5 billion into a jobs program to put our kids to work because I would rather invest in education and jobs than jails and incarceration.
0786	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0787	SANDERS	We have got to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour.
0788	SANDERS	The United States has got to join the rest of the industrialized world in guaranteeing health care to all people as a right.
0789	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0790	SANDERS	We need to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure.
0791	SANDERS	And when we do that, under my plan, we create 13 million decentpaying jobs.
0792	SALINAS	Thank you, Senator.
0793	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0794	RAMOS	We have a question on education.
0795	RAMOS	Senator, I'll continue with you.
0796	RAMOS	You propose free college tuition.
0797	SANDERS	No, I do not propose free college tuition, I proposed free tuition at public colleges and universities.
0798	SANDERS	Yes I did.
0799	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0800	RAMOS	So under your plan, potentially, millions of students who can not truly afford college would be getting federal subsidies.
0801	RAMOS	Is that right?
0802	SANDERS	No.
0803	SANDERS	What they would  look, this is what I believe, Jorge.
0804	SANDERS	This is the year 2016.
0805	SANDERS	Fifty years ago a high school degree got you a good job in the economy.
0806	SANDERS	Today, in many respects, a college degree is the equivalent of a high school degree.
0807	SANDERS	We have got to go beyond first grade to 12th grade when we talk about public education.
0808	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0809	SANDERS	So I do believe we should make public colleges and universities tuitionfree, and I don't believe we should punish millions of young and notsoyoung people with outrageous levels of student debt.
0810	RAMOS	Because my question was if you think, for instance, if Donald Trump's grandchildren or  I'm sorry  Hillary Clinton's grandchildren, should they be able to go for free?
0811	SANDERS	Absolutely.
0812	RAMOS	For free.
0813	SANDERS	Absolutely.
0814	SANDERS	They can go  I don't think they will, but Donald Trump's kids  Donald Trump's kids can go to public school right now, I think Secretary Clinton is talking about making community colleges free, they can go to those things.
0815	SANDERS	The point is we are going to get to Donald Trump by raising the taxes on the top 1 percent and our millionaires and billionaires.
0816	SANDERS	But all of our people, in my view, regardless of income, should have a right to get a higher education.
0817	SANDERS	I want children in the third grade to know that if they study hard, no matter what the income of their families, my family didn't have any income, my parents didn't go to college, they didn't have good income.
0818	SANDERS	I want every kid to know if you do your school work, study hard, yes, you will be able to get a college education.
0819	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0820	RAMOS	We'll continue this  we'll continue talking about education.
0821	RAMOS	For that, we go Enrique Cevedo has a question.
0822	RAMOS	Enrique Cevido.
0823	SYSTEM	[ through translator ]
0824	QUESTION	We just heard about free tuition from Senator Sanders, but right now there are millions of students who can't afford to pay their loans.
0825	QUESTION	Maria Martinez is 20 years old and she's a major of political science at MiamiDade College.
0826	UNKNOWN	Secretary Clinton, she said she wants to go to grad school and get a PhD.
0827	UNKNOWN	What are you going to do to help her achieve that goal and pay off her student debt?
0828	CLINTON	Well, congratulations on your education.
0829	CLINTON	And also on your plans for the future.
0830	CLINTON	And here's what I will do.
0831	CLINTON	We're going to refinance everyone's existing student debt, 40 million Americans have student debt.
0832	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0833	CLINTON	And right now, I go around asking people at my events if they know what their interest rate is and the interest rates literally go from like 8 percent to 14 percent.
0834	CLINTON	It's outrageous that at a time when interest rates have been historically low, people borrowing money to invest in their education are paying some of the highest interest rates around.
0835	CLINTON	And you can refinance your house to get a lower interest rate.
0836	CLINTON	You can refinance your car.
0837	CLINTON	Corporations can refinance their debt.
0838	CLINTON	Under my plan, you will be able to also lower your debt, move into a program to pay it back as a percentage of your income and more than that, my plan for debtfree tuition at public colleges and universities will eventually eliminate any student debt.
0839	CLINTON	But for people who have it, I'm going to put a date certain that after a certain number of years, you no longer have to pay anything.
0840	CLINTON	The government has to quit making money off of lending money to young people to get their education.
0841	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0842	UNKNOWN	Karen, let's go back to you.
0843	SANDERS	I think what Secretary Clinton just said is absolutely right.
0844	SANDERS	I think I said it many months before she said it, but thanks for copying a very good idea.
0845	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0846	SANDERS	Now the question though, you know, I have been criticized a lot for thinking big.
0847	SANDERS	You know, that's for believing that we can do great things as a nation.
0848	SANDERS	One of the things we should not be doing obviously, is punishing people for doing what we want them to do and that is to get an education.
0849	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0850	SANDERS	But here is the point.
0851	SANDERS	My program, making public colleges and universities tuition free, allowing people with debt to refinance at the lowest possible interest rates is a fairly expensive proposal, about $70 billion a year.
0852	SANDERS	You know how I'm going to pay for it?
0853	SANDERS	I'm going to pay for it by imposing a tax on Wall Street speculation.
0854	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0855	SANDERS	We bailed out  Secretary Clinton was one of those who voted to bail out Wall Street.
0856	SANDERS	Now I think it's time for Wall Street to help the working families of this country.
0857	RAMOS	Thank you senator.
0858	RAMOS	Thank you very much.
0859	CLINTON	Well, I'm going to respond to that, because I think it's a very important issue.
0860	CLINTON	And by the way, everybody, who, quote, "got money" in the quote, "bailout", that also included money for the auto rescue has paid it back.
0861	CLINTON	So, the Treasury was out nothing.
0862	CLINTON	Now that will no longer happen because we have DoddFrank and we will break up banks that pose a systemic threat to our economy.
0863	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0864	CLINTON	But let me say this.
0865	CLINTON	Senator Sanders has talked about free college for everybody.
0866	CLINTON	He's talked about universal, single payer health care for everybody.
0867	CLINTON	And yet, when you ask questions, as many of us have and more importantly, independent experts, it's very hard to get answers.
0868	CLINTON	And a lot of the answers say that this is going to be much more expensive than anything Senator Sanders is admitting to.
0869	CLINTON	This is going to increase the federal government dramatically.
0870	CLINTON	And, you know, my dad used to say, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
0871	SANDERS	All right.
0872	SANDERS	Let me respond to this.
0873	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0874	CLINTON	And we deserve answers about how these programs will actually work and how they would be paid for.
0875	SANDERS	I want you all to think.
0876	SANDERS	What Secretary Clinton is saying is that the United States should continue to be the only major country on earth that doesn't guarantee health care to all of our people.
0877	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0878	SANDERS	I think if the rest of the world can do it, we can.
0879	SANDERS	And by the way, not only are we being ripped off by the drug companies, we are spending far, far more per capita on health care than any other major country on earth.
0880	SANDERS	You may not think the American people are prepared to stand up to the insurance companies or the drug companies.
0881	SANDERS	I think they are.
0882	SANDERS	And I think we can pass...
0883	RAMOS	Thank you senator.
0884	RAMOS	[
0885	RAMOS	crosstalk ]
0886	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0887	CLINTON	This is a very important point in this debate, because I do believe in universal coverage.
0888	CLINTON	Remember, I fought for it 25 years ago.
0889	CLINTON	I believe in it.
0890	CLINTON	And I know that thanks the Affordable Care Act, we are now 90 percent of universal coverage.
0891	CLINTON	I will build on the Affordable Care Act.
0892	CLINTON	I will take it further.
0893	CLINTON	I will reduce the cost.
0894	CLINTON	But I just respectfully disagree.
0895	CLINTON	Between the Republicans trying to repeal the first chance we've ever had to get to universal health care, and Senator Sanders wanting to throw us into a contentious debate over singlepayer, I think the smart approach is build on and protect the Affordable Care Act.
0896	CLINTON	Make it work.
0897	CLINTON	Reduce the cost.
0898	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0899	SANDERS	I'm on the committee, I know a little bit about this, I'm on the committee, Health, Education, Labor Committee that helped write the Affordable Care Act.
0900	SANDERS	And it has done a number of good things.
0901	SANDERS	But when Secretary Clinton says, well, 90 percent of the people have insurance, yes, not really.
0902	SANDERS	Many of you may have insurance, but you have outrageously high deductibles and copayments.
0903	SANDERS	One out of five Americans cannot afford the prescription drugs their doctors prescribe.
0904	SANDERS	Elderly people are cutting their pills in half.
0905	SANDERS	I do believe that we should do what every other major country on earth does, and I think when the American people stand up and fight back, yes, we can have it, a Medicare for all health care system.
0906	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0907	TUMULTY	I'm going to call time here because I want to move on to a subject that more than two dozen Florida mayors have asked to raise with you.
0908	TUMULTY	They have asked us to share with you their concern over the effects of rising sea levels and climate change in their communities.
0909	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0910	TUMULTY	Just take a look at this map.
0911	TUMULTY	You can see that no state has more at stake than Florida does.
0912	TUMULTY	And no city has more at stake than Miami, the city in which we are sitting.
0913	TUMULTY	But many Republicans argue that this is not a manmade problem.
0914	TUMULTY	Senator Sanders, is it possible to move forward on this issue if you do not get a bipartisan consensus, and what would you do?
0915	SANDERS	Well, first of all, Karen, when you have Republican candidates for president and in Congress telling you that climate change is a hoax, which is Donald Trump and other candidates' position, what they are really saying is, we don't have the guts to take on the fossil fuel industry.
0916	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0917	SANDERS	What candidates are saying is if we stand up to the fossil fuel industry, and transform our energy system away from coal and oil and gas to energy efficiency and wind and solar and geothermal and other sustainable technologies, you know what happens to that Republican who listens to the scientists?
0918	SANDERS	On that day, that Republican loses his campaign funding from the Koch brothers and the fossil fuel industry.
0919	TUMULTY	So you've just described the problem, but how would you move forward given that this is the situation?
0920	SANDERS	The way I would move forward in every other area.
0921	SANDERS	And what we are doing in this campaign is fighting not only to become president, but I'm the only candidate who says no president, not Bernie Sanders, can do it all.
0922	SANDERS	You know what we need, Karen?
0923	SANDERS	We need a political revolution in this country.
0924	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0925	SANDERS	And when millions of people stand up and tell the fossil fuel industry that their profits, their shortterm profits are less significant than the longterm health of this planet, we will win.
0926	SANDERS	That is the way change always takes place.
0927	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0928	TUMULTY	Secretary Clinton, can we do this without a bipartisan consensus?
0929	TUMULTY	No major environmental legislation has ever passed without bipartisan votes.
0930	CLINTON	Well, Karen, first of all, I was proud a number of mayors from Florida campaign for me in South Carolina.
0931	CLINTON	I had a chance to talk to some of them about this issue.
0932	CLINTON	It is a really serious one.
0933	CLINTON	And there isn't much time left to do several things that I will move quickly to do.
0934	CLINTON	You can see already what's happening in Miami, particularly in Miami Beach with tides rising.
0935	CLINTON	So we do have to invest in resilience and mitigation while we are trying to cut emissions and make up for the fact that this is clearly manmade and managgravated.
0936	CLINTON	And there are certain things that the president has done through executive action that I will absolutely support.
0937	CLINTON	All the Republican say they will, if they're elected, heaven forbid, repeal all of those executive actions.
0938	CLINTON	I will maintain them and act on them.
0939	CLINTON	The clean power plan is something that Senator Sanders has said he would delay implementing, which makes absolutely no sense.
0940	CLINTON	We need to implement all of the president's executive actions and quickly move to make a bridge from coal to natural gas to clean energy.
0941	CLINTON	That is the way we will keep the lights on while we are transitioning to a clean energy future.
0942	CLINTON	And when I talk about resilience, I think that is an area we can get Republican support on.
0943	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
0944	SANDERS	Let me be very clear...
0945	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
0946	CLINTON	Because  because after all  excuse me.
0947	SANDERS	I have introduced...
0948	CLINTON	Excuse me, excuse me.

0953	SANDERS	Madam Secretary, when he asked me to speak...
0954	CLINTON	You know, you don't  you know, you don't have to do much more than look at rising insurance rates.
0955	RAMOS	Secretary, thank you very much.
0956	CLINTON	You know, most of the property in Florida will be at risk in the next 50 years.
0957	CLINTON	I think I can get a bipartisan consensus on resilience and then implementing the president's orders until we frankly win back enough seats, take back the Senate, and get back to bipartisan...
0958	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
0959	RAMOS	Senator Sanders?
0960	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0961	SYSTEM	[ inaudible ]
0962	SANDERS	have as much time as she just had.
0963	RAMOS	Absolutely.
0964	RAMOS	This is your debate.
0965	SANDERS	Thank you.
0966	SANDERS	Let's be clear.
0967	SANDERS	You're looking at the senator who introduced the most comprehensive climate change legislation in the history of the United States Senate.
0968	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0969	SANDERS	Now, I hope that Secretary Clinton would join me if we are serious about climate change, about imposing a tax on carbon on the fossil fuel industry and making massive investments in energy efficiency and sustainable energy.
0970	SANDERS	And by the way, while we are on the subject of energy, I hope you'll join me in ending fracking in the United States of America.
0971	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0972	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
0973	TUMULTY	Secretary Clinton, Senator Elizabeth Warren  Senator Elizabeth Warren says personnel is policy.
0974	TUMULTY	And she says that there is a revolving door between Wall Street and the highest levels of economic policymaking and regulation in Washington.
0975	TUMULTY	Three of the last four Treasury secretaries appointed by Democratic presidents had ties to Citigroup.
0976	TUMULTY	Do you agree with Elizabeth Warren's criticism that both your husband's administration and President Obama's have relied too heavily on advisers who represent the world view of the big banks?
0977	CLINTON	Well, Karen, I do agree that we have to end the revolving door.
0978	CLINTON	I strongly support a piece of legislation from Senator Tammy Baldwin that would do just that.
0979	CLINTON	And I will be looking for people who will put the interests of consumers first, who will do more to try to make sure Main Street flourishes.
0980	CLINTON	And I will very much reach out and ask for advice as to who should be appointed, including to Senator Warren and many of my other former colleagues in the Senate.
0981	CLINTON	But I think it's important also to look at what we want to accomplish.
0982	CLINTON	You know, in the debates we've had  maybe this is the seventh or so  Senator Sanders is always criticizing the two recent Democratic presidents  President Clinton and President Obama.
0983	CLINTON	And that's fine, but I wish he would criticize and join me in criticizing George W. Bush, who I think wrecked the economy and created the conditions for the great recession.
0984	CLINTON	You know, at the end of the '90s, we had 23 million new jobs.
0985	CLINTON	Incomes went up for everybody.
0986	CLINTON	We were talking earlier about what needs to be done for Latinos and African Americans.
0987	CLINTON	Well, we were doing it by the end of the '90s.
0988	CLINTON	Median family income went up 17 percent.
0989	CLINTON	For minorities, it went up even more.
0990	CLINTON	Along came the Republicans, trickledown economics  one of the worst ideas since snake oil  was put back into place.
0991	CLINTON	And we ended up with the great recession.
0992	CLINTON	President Obama had to rescue the economy.
0993	CLINTON	And I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for doing that.
0994	TUMULTY	Senator Sanders, your name was mentioned.
0995	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0996	SANDERS	Now, let me say this.
0997	SANDERS	I gather Secretary Clinton hasn't listened to too many of my speeches.
0998	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
0999	SANDERS	Or followed my work in the Congress as very few people stood up to George W. Bush whether it was the war in Iraq or any other of his policies.
1000	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
1001	SANDERS	Now, when we talk about the policies of the 1990s, I worked closely and supported President Clinton.
1002	SANDERS	And obviously, I have worked very closely in supporting President Obama, who has taken our economy a very long way from where Bush left us.
1003	SANDERS	But when you go back to the 1990s, let's remember, that's when Wall Street deregulation took place.
1004	SALINAS	Thank you senator.
1005	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1006	SANDERS	That's when disastrous trade policies took place.
1007	SALINAS	We're going to break now.
1008	SANDERS	Yes, good things happened, but some dangerous mistakes were made that laid the groundwork for some of the problems we're having with a disappearing middle class today.
1009	SALINAS	Thank you senator.
1010	TUMULTY	Time is up.
1011	TUMULTY	Thank you.
1012	RAMOS	We're going to take a break.
1013	RAMOS	And when we come back, we'll talk about Latin America.
1014	SYSTEM	[ Speaking in Spanish ]
1015	UNKNOWN	When we come back, we'll talk about Latin America.
1016	UNKNOWN	Don't leave.
1017	UNKNOWN	Of course you can follow us on Facebook live.
1018	UNKNOWN	Don't forget.
1019	SYSTEM	[ commercial break ]
1020	SYSTEM	[ through translator ]
1021	UNKNOWN	We continue with the Democratic debate.
1022	RAMOS	Let's talk about Latin America.
1023	RAMOS	Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders, it will be my welcome to Miami question.
1024	RAMOS	So it goes as follows.
1025	RAMOS	President Barack Obama is going to Cuba in two weeks.
1026	RAMOS	Forty percent of Cuban Americans supporting to uphold  oppose a new White House policy towards Cuba.
1027	RAMOS	If you were president, would you meet with the dissidents in Cuba?
1028	RAMOS	Would you meet with Fidel Castro?
1029	RAMOS	And would you consider Raul Castro a president or a dictator?
1030	RAMOS	Welcome to Miami.
1031	CLINTON	Well, first of all, I supported the president's moves.
1032	CLINTON	I helped to implement some of them leading up to the announcements when I was secretary of state, expanding travel opportunities, remittances.
1033	CLINTON	And I certainly told the president toward the end of my time that I hoped he would be able to move toward diplomatic relations and to make more of an impact by building up the relationship.
1034	CLINTON	And there are no better ambassadors for freedom, democracy and economic opportunity than Cuban Americans.
1035	CLINTON	So the more that we can have that kind of movement back and forth, the more likely we are to be able to move Cuba toward greater freedom, greater respect for rights.
1036	CLINTON	You know, I'm looking forward to following the president's trip.
1037	CLINTON	I do think meeting with dissidents, meeting with people who have been voices, tribunes of freedom and opportunity is important.
1038	CLINTON	The Cuban people deserve to have their human rights respected and upheld, they deserve to be able to move towards democracy where they pick their own leads.
1039	CLINTON	And I think both Castros have to be considered authoritarian and dictatorial because they are not freely chosen by the people that are in Cuba.
1040	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1041	CLINTON	I hope someday there will be leaders who are chosen by the Cuban people, and I hope that democracy will be deeply rooted in Cuban soil and that the people of Cuba will have every opportunity to fulfill their own dreams in their own country.
1042	CLINTON	That is my hope.
1043	SALINAS	Senator Sanders...
1044	RAMOS	On Facebook, by the way, this is the conversation that everybody is having, talking about Cuba.
1045	RAMOS	Senator Sanders.
1046	SANDERS	Look, I understand that not everybody in Florida or in the United States will agree with me, but I think we have got to end the embargo.
1047	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1048	SANDERS	I believe that we should move towards full and normalized political relations with Cuba.
1049	SANDERS	I think at the end of the day, it will be a good thing for the Cuban people.
1050	SANDERS	It will enable them, I think when they see people coming into their country from the United States, move in a more democratic direction, which is what I want to see.
1051	SANDERS	So right  I'm sorry.
1052	SALINAS	Let's continue with another question, Senator, if you don't mind.
1053	SANDERS	Sure.
1054	SALINAS	In 1985, you praised the Sandinista government and you said that Daniel Ortega was an impressive guy.
1055	SALINAS	This is what you said about Fidel Castro.
1056	SALINAS	Let's listen.
1057	SYSTEM	[ begin video clip ]
1058	SANDERS	You may recall way back in, when was it, 1961, they invaded Cuba, and everybody was totally convinced that Castro was the worst guy in the world.
1059	SANDERS	All the Cuban people were going to rise up in rebellion against Fidel Castro.
1060	SANDERS	They forgot that he educated their kids, gave them health care, totally transformed their society.
1061	SYSTEM	[ end video clip ]
1062	SALINAS	In South Florida there are still open wounds among some exiles regarding socialism and communism.
1063	SALINAS	So please explain what is the difference between the socialism that you profess and the socialism in Nicaragua, Cuba and Venezuela.
1064	SANDERS	Well, let me just answer that.
1065	SANDERS	What that was about was saying that the United States was wrong to try to invade Cuba, that the United States was wrong trying to support people to overthrow the Nicaraguan government, that the United States was wrong trying to overthrow in 1954, the government  democratically elected government of Guatemala.
1066	SANDERS	Throughout the history of our relationship with Latin America we've operated under the socalled Monroe Doctrine, and that said the United States had the right do anything that they wanted to do in Latin America.
1067	SANDERS	So I actually went to Nicaragua and I very shortly opposed the Reagan administration's efforts to overthrow that government.
1068	SANDERS	And I strongly opposed earlier Henry Kissinger and the  to overthrow the government of Salvador Aliende in Chile.
1069	SANDERS	I think the United States should be working with governments around the world, not get involved in regime change.
1070	SANDERS	And all of these actions, by the way, in Latin America, brought forth a lot of very strong antiAmerican sentiments.
1071	SANDERS	That's what that was about.
1072	SALINAS	Senator, in retrospect, have you ever regretted the characterizations that you made of Daniel Ortega and Fidel Castro that way?
1073	SANDERS	I'm sorry.
1074	SANDERS	Please say that...
1075	SALINAS	In retrospect, have you ever regretted the characterizations of Daniel Ortega and Fidel Castro that you made in 1985?
1076	SANDERS	The key issue here was whether the United States should go around overthrowing small Latin American countries.
1077	SANDERS	I think that that was a mistake...
1078	SALINAS	You didn't answer the question.
1079	SANDERS	...both in Nicaragua and Cuba.
1080	SANDERS	Look, let's look at the facts here.
1081	SANDERS	Cuba is, of course, an authoritarian undemocratic country, and I hope very much as soon as possible it becomes a democratic country.
1082	SANDERS	But on the other hand...
1083	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1084	SANDERS	...on the other hands, it would be wrong not to state that in Cuba they have made some good advances in health care.
1085	SANDERS	They are sending doctors all over the world.
1086	SANDERS	They have made some progress in education.
1087	SANDERS	I think by restoring full diplomatic relations with Cuba, it will result in significant improvements to the lives of Cubans and it will help the United States and our business community invest.
1088	SALINAS	Thank you, Senator.
1089	SALINAS	Your time is up on that.
1090	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1091	RAMOS	Secretary, I have a question on Puerto Rico.
1092	RAMOS	Puerto Rico is bankrupt.
1093	RAMOS	It owes more than $70 billion it cannot pay and we have a question from Facebook.
1094	RAMOS	Lian Purvea is asking you the following I would like to know if during the first 100 days of your presidency, you will help Puerto Rico restructure its public debt and help its economy.
1095	RAMOS	The first 100 days, secretary.
1096	CLINTON	Absolutely, although it happens before I am president if I am so fortunate to be.
1097	CLINTON	I have been calling for months that the Congress must give authority to Puerto Rico to restructure its debts.
1098	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1099	CLINTON	Just like it has enabled states and cities to restructure their debt.
1100	CLINTON	And it's a grave injustice for the Congress, led by the Republicans to be refusing to enact that opportunity within the bankruptcy law.
1101	CLINTON	And what we see in Puerto Rico now is a lot of suffering.
1102	CLINTON	We see schools being closed, we see health care being denied and we see a thousand Puerto Rican families a month moving to the United States, mostly to Florida.
1103	CLINTON	Puerto Ricans are citizen of America.
1104	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1105	CLINTON	They deserve to be treated as citizens and to be given the opportunity to get back on their feet economically.
1106	CLINTON	And I just want to add one thing to the question you were asking Senator Sanders.
1107	CLINTON	I think in that same interview, he praised what he called the revolution of values in Cuba and talked about how people were working for the common good, not for themselves.
1108	CLINTON	I just couldn't disagree more.
1109	CLINTON	You know, if the values are that you oppress people, you disappear people, you imprison people or even kill people for expressing their opinions, for expressing freedom of speech, that is not the kind of revolution of values that I ever want to see anywhere.
1110	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1111	SANDERS	Well, as I said earlier, I don't believe it is the business of the United States government to be overthrowing small countries around the world.
1112	SANDERS	And number two, when you get to Puerto Rico, there's an issue that we have not talked about.
1113	SANDERS	That little island is $73 billion in debt and the government now is paying interest rates of up to 11 percent.
1114	SANDERS	And many of the bonds that they are paying off were purchased by vulture capitalists for 30 cents on the dollar.
1115	SANDERS	And what I have said in talking to the leaders of Puerto Rico, we've got to bring people together.
1116	SANDERS	And it's not the people of Puerto Rico, or the children or the schools.
1117	TUMULTY	Senator, OK
1118	SANDERS	But maybe some of these vulture capitalists who are going to have to lose a little bit of money in this process.
1119	TUMULTY	We need to move on to another topic.
1120	TUMULTY	Secretary Clinton, there is a vacancy on the supreme court at a very crucial moment.
1121	TUMULTY	Among other things, the court is considering the most significant abortion restrictions in a generation.
1122	TUMULTY	So I would like to share with you a question that we got from Facebook from Joshua Dansby, a law student in Washington, D.C. who wants to know what specific forms of qualifications you would look for in a Supreme Court justice?
1123	CLINTON	Well, I think this is one of the most important issues facing our country right now.
1124	CLINTON	And I fully support President Obama's intention under the constitution to nominate a successor to Justice Scalia.
1125	CLINTON	And I believe...
1126	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1127	CLINTON	...I believe no state probably understands this better than Florida.
1128	CLINTON	Because let's remember three words Bush versus Gore.
1129	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1130	CLINTON	A court took away a presidency.
1131	CLINTON	Now we've got the Republican Congress trying to take away the constitution.
1132	CLINTON	And we should not tolerate that.
1133	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1134	CLINTON	And so from my perspective, it is imperative that we put enormous pressure on the Republicans in the Senate to do their constitutional duty.
1135	CLINTON	Now, obviously you look for people who are not only qualified on paper, but have a heart, have life experience, understand what these decisions mean in the lives of Americans.
1136	CLINTON	And understand the balance of power that their decisions can disrupt one way or the other.
1137	CLINTON	So clearly, I would look for people who believe that Roe v. Wade is settled law and that Citizens United needs to be overturned as quickly as possible.
1138	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1139	TUMULTY	It's time to go to commercial.
1140	TUMULTY	We're going to commercial.
1141	TUMULTY	We'll be right back.

1154	SALINAS	We are reaching the end, asking the candidates to give their last words.
1155	SALINAS	We're coming to the end of this wonderful debate, and it's time for your closing remarks.
1156	SALINAS	Secretary Clinton, you're first.
1157	CLINTON	Well, thank you very much for a lively debate.
1158	CLINTON	And I appreciate greatly all the questions, especially the questions in person from the people here and those coming at us from Facebook.
1159	CLINTON	It just reinforces my strong commitment to do everything I can to break down all the barriers that stand in the way of people living up to their own potential, and of our country doing the same.
1160	CLINTON	So I am going to take on those economic barriers.
1161	CLINTON	I have a plan to create jobs and raise incomes.
1162	CLINTON	I'm going to take on the education barriers that often leave too many children behind even after they have completed schooling.
1163	CLINTON	I'm going to take on the healthcare barriers.
1164	CLINTON	I'm going to do everything I can to make sure that we unite our country.
1165	CLINTON	I will find common ground, just as I have as first lady, as senator and secretary of state.
1166	CLINTON	I will also stand my ground wherever matters of principles are at stake.
1167	CLINTON	I would be honored to have your support in the upcoming primary on Tuesday, and hope to have the great honor of serving you as your president.
1168	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1169	RAMOS	Senator Sanders, your closing remarks.
1170	SANDERS	This has been a wonderful debate, but time being limited, some of the most important issues facing our country have not been asked.
1171	SANDERS	And that is, is it acceptable that in America the top 0.1 percent now owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent.
1172	SANDERS	Is it acceptable that while the average American works longer hours for lower wages, 58 percent of all new income is going to the top 1 percent.
1173	SANDERS	Is it acceptable that Wall Street and billionaires are spending hundreds of millions of dollars trying to buy elections?
1174	SANDERS	Is that democracy or this that oligarchy?
1175	SANDERS	Which is why I believe we've got to overturn Citizens United and move to public funding of elections.
1176	SANDERS	Is it right that in the greatest, wealthiest country in the history of the world, so many of our young people can't even afford to go to college or leave school deeply in debt, in the wealthiest country in the history of the world?
1177	SANDERS	If we stand up, fight back, we can do a lot better.
1178	SANDERS	That's why I'm running for president.
1179	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1180	SALINAS	Secretary and Senator, we want to thank both of you for being here, for joining us tonight.

1184	TUMULTY	And on behalf of The Washington Post and Univision and Facebook, we'd like to thank you again for joining us in this debate and also to remind people to get out and vote.
1185	SYSTEM	[ through translator ]
1186	RAMOS	We want to use these last moments, it's very important to go out and vote, remember next Tuesday, March 15th is elections in Florida, Illinois, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, all these states  in all these states the Hispanic vote is crucial
1187	SYSTEM	[ inaudible ]
1188	RAMOS	Talk about the importance of Hispanic votes, how in very close races it is the Hispanic vote that can choose the next president of the United States.
1189	RAMOS	This is Hispanic power, but the only way that this can happen is if we all go out and vote.
1190	RAMOS	So you know it perfectly, who does not vote doesn't count.
1191	SYSTEM	[ through translator ]
1192	SALINAS	And as you know, nobody can reach the White House without the Hispanic vote.
1193	SALINAS	Remember, don't let others decide for you.
1194	SALINAS	The power is in your hands, you have to participate, you have to vote.
1195	SALINAS	Thank you for being with us this evening and thank you for trusting in Univision.
