Rick Perry questioned efforts by congressional Democrats to pass a health care overhaul, the Texas Democratic Party accused him of undermining Texans' care with policies that benefit private companies instead of citizens.\n\n\"Perry's 'Pay to Play' politics led him to send $899 million to an offshore call center in Bermuda \u2014 a privatization scheme that deeply cost Texas taxpayers and resulted in 237,000 children losing their health insurance through CHIP,\" according to an Oct. 5 party news release. CHIP stands for Children's Health Insurance Program, which serves children of the working poor.\n\nThe specter of needy Texans forced to seek assistance from operators in Bermuda \u2014 causing more than 200,000 children to lose their insurance coverage \u2014 seemed shocking.\n\nWe wondered if the Democrats' charge was true.\n\nThe Democrats' news release cited a 2007 article by the San Antonio Express-News.We couldn't find anything in the Express-News article to back up the fiery claim.\n\nA party activist quickly admitted at least partial error.\n\nPhillip Martin of the Texas Democratic Trust, which helps the party, said the press release was worded incorrectly. \"The call centers obviously weren't in Bermuda,\" Martin said, \"but the company was based in Bermuda \u2014 so Texas taxpayers' money did go to a company in Bermuda.\"\n\nThe state had hired Accenture, a consulting and outsourcing company, to lead a group of companies called the Texas Access Alliance that would field social service applications and enroll clients. Accenture LLP, the U.S. subsidiary of Accenture Ltd., was incorporated in Bermuda in 2001, though shareholders voted last year to move the place of incorporation to Ireland.\n\nBut CHIP phone calls haven't been going to either country. In fact, they're answered in Texas.\n\nWe learned from the Health and Human Services Commission that the state's contract with Accenture required call-center employees to work from U.S. locations. The centers, located in Austin, San Antonio, Midland and Athens (the city near Tyler in East Texas \u2014 not Greece), have been run by Virgina-based Maximus, which signed a contract with the state when Accenture's role ended in June 2007.\n\nCommission spokeswoman Stephanie Goodman said: \"The only way a call could be sent out of state is if a catastrophic situation happened that took down all the phone lines.\"\n\nIn a broader context, the Democrats\u2019 Martin suggested the creation of the call centers still was part of a Republican-fostered privatization scheme driving down CHIP sign-ups.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMartin\u2019s point: In 2003, the GOP-led Legislature made a push for privatization. Part of that involved directing the HHSC to determine whether using call centers run by private firms would cut costs.\n\nKirsten Gray, Democratic Party communications director, explained that \"'Pay to Play' is a political term of art,\" which we assume means Perry's politics are inspired by whoever coughs up enough money toward his career.\n\nHe did sign HB 2292 \u2014 the legislation that ushered sweeping changes into the state's health and human services \u2014 but Rep. Arlene Wohlgemuth authored the bill, and the Legislature passed it.\n\nAccenture later landed the state\u2019s call-center contract, which was projected to cost $899 million over five years, the cost figure cited by the Democrats. The privately run call centers were set up to process applications for CHIP, food stamps and Medicaid. Accenture ended up getting $245 million because Maximus took over the call centers.\n\nWe made a run at gauging whether the creation of the call centers alone reduced CHIP participation, as the Democrats claimed.\n\nIt\u2019s just not so.\n\nTrue, during the two years that Accenture was employed by the state, CHIP caseloads decreased and applications were lost in the system, causing children to lose health coverage.\n\nBut those numbers first dropped before the Accenture contract \u2014 after lawmakers approved policy changes restricting enrollment. For instance, an amendment adopted in the 2003 legislative session required clients to re-enroll every six months instead of 12 \u2014 a reduced time-frame intended to keep children from staying in the program past the time that their parents\u2019 income surged. However, that resulted in more children being dropped from the rolls because their parents failed to re-enroll in time.\n\nCHIP sign-ups rebounded a bit after legislators restored the 12-month enrollment period in 2007.\n\nAnne Dunkelberg, associate director of the Center for Public Policy Priorities, which advocates for low-income Texans, summed up: \"The state implemented some really, really ill-considered policy changes, all at the same time.\"\n\nShe said that a combination of policy changes, privatization and staffing cuts all contributed to CHIP reductions, but it's impossible to blame any one factor for CHIP reductions.\n\nTrue, privatizing oversight of CHIP may not have delivered hoped-for savings, and enrollment may have been reduced.\n\nBut the Democrats' claim that Perry sent nearly $900 million to an outfit in Bermuda, directly causing more than 200,000 children to lose their health coverage, amounted to a big overreach. If they'd been more careful \u2014 even saying that the call centers were part of a troubled privatized model \u2014 our analysis may have been different.\n\nBut the party misstated the facts, undermining what could have been a meaningful critique.\n\nWe rule the statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-15398"}
