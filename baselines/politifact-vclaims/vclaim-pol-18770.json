Vicky Hartzler, R-4th District, spoke on the timetable of vaccine development and deployment with Operation Warp Speed before claiming, \"We\u2019re starting to reach almost herd immunity in this nation, so we\u2019ll be on the downside of this virus very soon.\"\nThe claim touches on two topics: herd immunity and the timetable of the virus.\nClaims about herd immunity are not new. We\u2019ve covered the subject extensively.\nRELATED:\n\n\nHow helpful can herd immunity be in ending the coronavirus pandemic?\n\n\nNo, the U.S. hasn\u2019t achieved herd immunity from COVID-19\n\n\nCorralling the facts on herd immunity\u00a0\n\n\nHartzler hit similar notes in an October interview with KMIZ/ABC, saying, \"I feel like we will rebound fully just once we get ... get this vaccine developed and we reach herd immunity, which could be fairly soon as well.\"\nWe\u2019ve noted before that public health experts say herd immunity is a questionable strategy. Even so, we have a long way to go before we get to herd immunity. Here\u2019s why.\nWhat is herd immunity?\nEssentially, herd immunity is a numbers game for infectious diseases. The more immune a population becomes, the less likely it becomes for an infected individual to come into contact with a non-immune person and continue the chain of transmission. Herd immunity does not necessarily stop transmission; herd immunity makes transmission less likely.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndividuals might gain immunity by getting infected. Or, they can get vaccinated, which isn\u2019t an option yet.\u00a0\u00a0\nThat leaves getting infected, which is not ideal due to the risk of death and known and unknown long-term health effects. However, there\u2019s another problem: Immunity by way of infection might not last long enough because of reported cases of reinfection.\nThe known and unknown health risks of the coronavirus in addition to the uncertainty of the immunity render herd immunity infeasible until there is a vaccine.\nWhy is it infeasible?\nScientists\u2019 estimate that 60% to 70% of the population would have to become infected before herd immunity is reached. For reference, that\u2019s more than 200 million Americans.\nThis threshold is where Hartzler\u2019s claim falls apart. At the time of her Sept. 2 claim, 5.8 million individuals had been infected in the U.S., which is around 1.7%. There\u2019s much more than an order of magnitude between the infected population then and the one required.\nAs of Oct. 5, around the time of Hartzler\u2019s KMIZ interview, over 7.2 million individuals had been infected, amounting to around 2.2% of the population \u2013 still a long way off from the herd immunity threshold.\nWe tried reaching out to Hartzler\u2019s campaign multiple times for evidence but received no response.\nAdditionally, because the virus is so new, experts still don\u2019t fully understand how immunity to COVID-19 works. Cases of reinfection demonstrate that immunity from a prior infection may not be enough if the virus changes enough to render it ineffective.\u00a0\nOnce a vaccine is approved, supply may be limited. Operation Warp Speed aims to accelerate the development, production and distribution of the vaccine, but it will take time to ramp up the supply of vaccine and distribute it. So herd immunity through vaccination is a long way off.\nOur ruling\nHartzler claimed, \"We\u2019re starting to reach almost herd immunity in this nation, so we\u2019ll be on the downside of this virus very soon.\"\nWithout a vaccine, herd immunity relies on infections driving immunity. At the time of the quote \u2013 and now \u2013 immunity in the United States is far short of that required by estimates.\nThis statement is not accurate.
