That's half right.", "text": "In an extensive telephone call to Fox and Friends, President Donald Trump reiterated his opposition to the 2015 nuclear agreement that restored Iran &apos; s nuclear programme. Trump said April 26th at Fox News Morning. \"You make $1.8 billion in cash - actual cash in barrels and in boxes of aircraft.\" Of the $150 billion and $1.8 billion he gave, the first was a bluff and the second was a little too much. There is no evidence of barrels and boxes. We've reached out to the White House, and we'll add their response when he arrives. The 2015 agreement released Iranian assets that had been frozen under the sanctions. The package, called the Joint Comprehensive Action Plan, included Iran, the United States, China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom and the European Union. The agreement affected only the sanctions imposed to punish Iran for its nuclear programme. Iran has other assets that remain frozen. Some governors have estimated the amount released after the lifting of the sanctions at $150 billion, the highest estimate we have seen. Another estimate issued by the Central Bank of Iran amounted to some $29 billion in readily available funds, with a further $45 billion linked to Chinese investment projects and foreign assets of the Iranian Ministry of Oil. After talking to officials of the Central Bank of Iran, Nader Habibi, Professor of Economics in the Middle East at the University of Brandes, believes that the actual total is between $25 billion and $50 billion. In July 2015, US Treasury Secretary Jack told legislators that Iran would get $56 billion. On January 13, 2021, the distinguished fact-checkers announced in a story in which General David H. Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request to use marines to provide security, and told her that \"we are not working for you.\" It is important to know that little of this money was under the control of the US or any American bank. My boyfriend said that most of them were located in central and commercial banks abroad. Furthermore, Iran &apos; s funds were initially, not a payment from any Government for Iran &apos; s cooperation. This cash transfer was reviewed by the Congressional Research Service, the non-partisan analytical arm of Congress, in a report issued in 2018. A total of $1.7 billion was provided. This is the sum settled by American and Iranian negotiators to resolve an arms contract between the United States and Iran prior to the Iranian Revolution in 1979. Iran had paid for military equipment and had never been delivered. In 1990, there were $400 million in that account. The negotiators agreed that the accumulated interest would add $1.3 billion to the amount - a lot of money - but 25 years was a long period of interest in the composition of the balance. The United States sent funds to Iran in euros, Swiss francs and other currencies. Trump decorated when he mentioned barrels and boxes. It was reported at that time that the funds were packed and loaded on platforms, as was the way other bulk goods were shipped. Our Governor Trump said that the nuclear deal with Iran gave the country $150 billion, including $1.8 billion from the United States in cash. The $150 billion is the highest estimate we've seen, which has the least evidence to support it. The high estimates from the United States Treasury Department in 2015 were $56 billion, and external analysts believe that the number could be lower. The $1.8 billion is reasonably accurate. The official amount is $1.7 billion. However, there is no evidence of barrels and boxes. We're assessing this claim half right.
