A few weeks ago, Jane Ives announced her candidacy for the seat. A former state representative from Whitton, who ran the 2018 GOP primary campaign against the then government. Bruce Runner, Ives, was a little known at state level before she showed it. I've only lost Rawner's basic education by a few percentage points. In 2020, Ives is expected to face, as part of a rematch of some kind, the former Deputy Governor of Ronner, Evelyn Sanguinetti, who ran alongside Ronner in the bid for his failed re-election in 2018, and who lost it to the democratic government. J.P. Pritzker. :: During a recent television interview, Ives addressed an issue that in many ways was the cornerstone of the 2018 Yves Challenge to Runner, which I perceived as too liberal in social issues. Speaking of the record of \"The Runner-Sangenti Group\" in Fox 32 \"Flannerid Abe,\" Eve claimed that the former Lieutenant Governor, who opposed abortion rights, had not taken an explicit position against Ronner's decision to sign a controversial bill that expanded public funding for abortions. \"She has not openly stood up against it, in strong opposition to it,\" said the host Yves Mike Flannery. \"Whatever their opinion is, the media has never taken it in this regard. She may have opposed it, but she still stands by her man all the time while he continues to save the big companies on the rise of price-payers and everything else, so she stood with him hand in hand all the time.\" The comments of Eve clearly indicate that Sanguinetti did not state her disagreement with the abortion measure. However, many of the news articles published on the day Ronner announced his intention to sign the bill reveal that his deputy governor made her clear that she was opposed. The rewriting of history elected Ronner Governor in 2014 after being nominated for the post of fiscal governor pro-selection with \"no social agenda.\" In September 2017, he signed a measure extending the coverage of abortion to women in government health and medical care plans and ensured that proceedings in Illinois would remain legal even if Roe v. Wade was abolished by the United States Supreme Court. This step followed months of pressure from abortion rights groups after Ronner said earlier that year that he intended to reverse the draft law &apos; s general concerns about tax-funded abortions. During his press conference, he announced that he would sign the bill, known as HB40, Ronner was surrounded by advocates of abortion rights, including former lieutenant Corinne Wood. But Sanguinati was remarkably absent from the event. Instead, I issued a statement on the same day expressing opposition to the Governor &apos; s decision, which was taken by many local and national media: Bruce Runner stated at a press conference on 28 September 2017 that \"I am personally pro-choice. I've always been. I was not surprised when I was elected governor.\" By Matt Dietrich: October 10, 2017, \"as a pro-life Republican, I disagree with the Governor's decision to sign HB 40,\" came out. \"I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for a 15-year-old refugee who chose to be with me and keep me. I am aware that this law is a political ploy to divide the people of Illinois.\" Her statement continued, referring to the Democrats who control the Council of State and the Senate and send the bill to the Ronner office. \"As I disagree with the Governor on this, we must focus on the areas of our agreement, we will make real reforms that we need to heart Illinois.\" After his decision to sign the procedure, Ronner faced the anger of many Republicans who said that they felt that he had betrayed them. This list included Yves, one of the most conservative members of the legislature. She announced her candidacy for governor a month later, saying that Rawner had offended himself by signing the law what she described as \"very extreme measures,\" including HB40. We have repeatedly contacted the Ives campaign and e-mailed it to ask how it paid tribute to Sanguinati &apos; s widely publicized statement, with her claim that the former lieutenant governor did not break her lines with Ronner on this matter. Neither she nor any speakers responded to our requests. Our referee, Ives, said that Deputy Governor Sangenti \"didn't stand in public against\" Rawner's decision to sign a bill expanding public funding for abortions in Illinois. This version contrasts with several news articles published on the day Ronner announced that he would sign the bill, which is directly quoted from a Sanguinetti statement that clearly states that she does not agree with his decision. We appreciate Ives calling it wrong. It's wrong that the phrase isn't accurate.
