There is no evidence linking a deadly case of coronavirus to a Chinese restaurant in Albany, N.Y.\u00a0\nAt first glance, an image on Facebook appears to be a screenshot of a post by ABC News sharing a story about the coronavirus. Anchored by an image of a Chinese restaurant, the headline of the supposed news storysays, \"Man visited Albany, N.Y. days before dying from coronavirus.\"\n\"Upstate New York City Chinese restaurant possibly linked to man\u2019s death days before returning home from Washington state,\" reads text above the story.\nThere is no evidence for these claims. The image is not a real ABC News post.\u00a0\n\nIt was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Seven of the Washington deaths were linked to a nursing home facility, Life Care Center of Kirkland.\u00a0\nNew York has confirmed two cases of coronavirus as of March 3. The first case was a woman in her 30s who had recently traveled to Iran, one of the places the virus has hit hardest. The second case was a 50-year-old man who had recently traveled to Miami, Fla., but not any countries considered central to the outbreak.\nNo news reports mention any ties to an Albany Chinese restaurant.\nThere is also no evidence this image is actually a screenshot of an ABC News post. The news organization has not posted this story on its Facebook feed, and no ABC News stories make the same claims as the post.\nWhen comparing this post to actual ABC News Facebook posts, there are a number of differences. The most obvious difference is that the \"ABC News\" title at the top of a Facebook post typically appears in blue, given that it links to the organization\u2019s main Facebook feed. The post does not match ABC News\u2019 usual font and there are also no other recent Facebook posts from ABC News with an estimated reading time for their articles.\nWe rate this Facebook post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18043"}
