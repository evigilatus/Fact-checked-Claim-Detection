We reviewed news stories and spoke by phone and email with Kumanan Wilson of the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, author of a February 2012 article on estimating flu pandemic deaths in the European Journal of Public Health, and University of Texas professor of biology and statistics Lauren Meyers.\n\nMeyers told us, \"I would say it\u2019s a certainty we will get new strains of virus flu that emerge in human populations and cause widespread illness.\" Wilson said, \"The consensus is yes, there will be regular pandemics.\"\n\nIn a Sept. 19, 2011, news story on a conference of the European Scientific Working Group on Influenza, Scientific American quoted University of Virginia School of Medicine professor Frederick Hayden: \"What is clear is that (the next flu pandemic) is when, not if.\" The story described his statement as \"one of many proclamations of coming plague during the meeting that was tinged with just enough urgency to generate attention (and research funding) but not ignite an all-out panic.\"\n\nThe World Health Organization\u2019s most recent Global Vaccine Action Plan referred to preparing for \"the next pandemic,\" though noting that it\u2019s \"impossible to predict the exact timing or nature of a future pandemic.\"\n\n\"In an influenza pandemic, most of the world\u2019s population will be highly susceptible to the virus infection and it is conceivable that the virus will spread rapidly,\" the 2006 plan said.\n\n\"At the present time, if an influenza pandemic were to occur, the potential vaccine supply would fall several billion doses short of the amount needed to provide protection to the global population.\"\n\nThe plan\u2019s executive summary concludes, \"Action must start now \u2013 this fact cannot be emphasized strongly enough \u2013 action must start now if the world is to prepare itself in the shortest possible time for a potential influenza pandemic.\" WHO is working on an updated plan, according to its web site.\n\nThat degree of preparation, experts told us, is one of the largest elements in determining how many people will die. Other factors include how the contagion spreads, how quickly it kills, how early it\u2019s detected and how coordinated the medical response is.\n\nBut preparation is essential because once a major outbreak begins, there\u2019s no time to manufacture enough of the right vaccine.\n\nEach flu season, Lillibridge said, the CDC and counterparts around the world track fast-changing viruses to predict which vaccines will be most needed.\n\nCDC spokesman Tom Skinner told us by phone that once the prediction is made, the CDC sends a \"seed\" virus to vaccine manufacturers. It takes five months to produce and ship the vaccines, he said.\n\nTechnology, communication and distribution give today\u2019s medics a huge advantage over those who faced the 1918-19 \u00a0\"Spanish flu\" pandemic, the event both Sharp and Lillibridge used to frame the current threat. That global outbreak was \"the mother of them all,\" said a Nov. 26, 2007, Guardian (UK) news story that listed the death tolls for the 20th century\u2019s three flu pandemics: \"The 1968-69 Hong Kong flu killed up to a million people globally, the 1957-58 Asian flu killed up to 1.5 million\" and the Spanish flu killed \"around 40 million\" -- more than World War I, the story said.\n\nAll were caused, according to a June 22, 2012, Bloomberg news story, by flu viruses that started with animals, mixed with human flu and then mutated into new strains that humans weren\u2019t immune to.\n\nSo was 2009\u2019s pandemic of H1N1 \"swine flu,\" which according to the World Health Organization proved less deadly than had been feared, killing about 16,000 people worldwide. Through \"pure good luck,\" said an Aug. 10, 2010, WHO report, the mutating virus didn\u2019t develop resistance to the vaccine or change into a more deadly form.\n\nAs to the estimated death toll of a future pandemic, Lillibridge told us, \"The chancellor is right in the ballpark.\"\n\nLater, through an A&M center spokeswoman, Lillibridge said that if a virus as deadly as the 1918 strain broke out, \"assuming the same mortality rate today, and a world population of 6.9 billion, that is about 193 million deaths.\"\n\nMeyer agreed that the range Sharp gave, 80 million to 90 million deaths, is plausible, noting that the Spanish flu might have killed that many even with the world\u2019s much smaller population at the time. \"But if and when we get one as deadly as 1918, I think there\u2019s quite a bit of uncertainty,\" she said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Wilson expressed skepticism as to the 80 million to 90 million range: \"Officials said the same this time around (the 2009 pandemic) with the most conservative estimates being grossly higher than the actual death toll.\"\n\nWilson\u2019s article in the February 2012 issue of the European Journal of Public Health rounded up several of those estimates:\n\n\nA Dec. 8, 2004, WHO \"best case\" scenario of 2 million to 7 million deaths.\n\nA Dec. 23, 2006, article in The Lancet saying that if a flu strain like the 1918-19 virus had emerged in 2004, it could have killed 51 million to 81 million people.\n\nA May 5, 2005, article in the New England Journal of Medicine saying that an H5N1 \"bird flu\" pandemic could be as deadly as the Spanish flu and, based on the change in world population, could kill 180 million to 360 million.\n\n\n\n\nOur ruling\n\nSharp said scientists predict \"sometime in the future, an event that will kill \u2026 somewhere between 80 and 90 million people.\"\n\nScientists agree another pandemic is coming. However, they say the number of deaths will depend on many variables -- early detection, coordinated response and luck, to name a few -- and there is not uniform agreement among scientists that 80 million to 90 million people would die.
