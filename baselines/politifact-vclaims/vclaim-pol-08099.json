He gave an example from his own experience.\nFung said he hired a campaign manager for one of his previous campaigns.\n\"Well, lo and behold, I got this hundred-something dollar fee that came from the Department of Labor and Training, for hazardous materials.\"\nFung said he had only the one employee, and, as a political campaign, no contact with hazardous materials.\n\"But because you have an employee, you have to pay that,\" he said.\nDo you? We checked it out.\nFung\u2019s political career goes back to 2002, when he won a seat on \u00a0the Cranston City Council (he was the second highest council vote getter). His first mayoral run, unsuccessful as it turned out, was in 2006, when he lost to Democrat Michael Napolitano by 79 votes.\nIt was for that campaign that he hired a manager, Ryan Bilodeau. Copies of Fung\u2019s 2006 campaign finance reports on file in the State Archives show regular payments to Bilodeau, as well as IRS withholding and state tax payments. They also show, on March 12, 2006, a $42 check made out to the state Department of Labor and Training, with the notation \"right to know registration form.\"\nThe Department of Labor and Training is charged with enforcing what is known as the \"Hazardous Substances Right to Know Act,\" so named because it says employees in Rhode Island have a right to know what hazardous materials are used in their workplaces.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Godlewski\n\n\nstated on January 9, 2021 in Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all women that lost jobs (in the December jobs report), it was mostly Black and Latina women. In fact, white women gained employment.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Nusaiba Mizan \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe law requires businesses that deal with hazardous materials to notify workers -- and the labor department -- about the materials. \u00a0Even if a business doesn\u2019t use any hazardous materials, it still has to file the form.\nIn 2006, when Fung hired his campaign manager, \u00a0all Rhode Island employers were assessed a $42 fee when they filed the required declaration form, DLT spokeswoman Nikki Armstrong said.\nAnd that was the law. Until July 2013.\nThat was when the General Assembly passed a budget article, submitted by Governor Chafee\u2019s administration, that eliminated the fee.\n\"This change is the latest in a series of cost-saving initiatives my administration has made to improve regulations and to build a more customer-friendly business climate in Rhode Island,\" Chafee said in a statement announcing the abolition of the fee, an action he said was projected to save about 10,000 state businesses collectively around $400,000 a year.\nFung for Governor campaign manager Patrick A. Sweeney acknowledged that the candidate was off by $58. But he said Fung\u2019s bigger point, \"that we have a plethora of regulations that are hurting small businesses across the country,\" was still valid.\nOur ruling\nAllan Fung, recollecting events of eight years ago, said he had to pay a fee of about $100 for filing a hazardous materials notification form when he hired his first campaign staff member.\nHe was right about there being a fee, but he overstated the amount. And in expressing his frustration about the fee, he gave the impression it still exists, when, in fact, it was eliminated a year ago.\nBecause the statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.\n(If you have a claim you\u2019d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, email us at [email\u00a0protected] And follow us on Twitter: @politifactri.)", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08099"}
