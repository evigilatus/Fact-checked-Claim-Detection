Are you saying you would cut any dollars away from what funds charter schools in the state?\"\nGillum replied, \"No, I am not proposing any change to the current status quo. But what we are saying is that we are going to put money into our public system where over 90 percent of our kids are still being educated.\"\nDeSantis accused Gillum of \"singing a different tune.\"\n\"In the Democratic primary, he said that charter schools would be done,\" said DeSantis, who defended the rights of parents to choose charter schools.\nWe looked back at Gillum\u2019s statements about charter schools to see if he had called for any change to the status quo, and found he has been consistently critical of the involvement of for-profit entities in charter schools. (He has also called for a $1 billion increase in corporate taxes for education.)\nDeSantis wants to continue many Republican school initiatives, including supporting charter schools.\nGillum\u2019s criticism of charter schools\nGillum has been a critic of for-profit involvement in charter schools throughout his campaign.\nCharter schools are public schools but operated by an entity other than a school district. They must be operated or controlled by a nonprofit organization by law, but some nonprofit charter school boards enter into contracts with for-profit companies. (It is hard to say exactly how many, due to murky state data however charter schools affiliated with for-profit firms are a large and growing sector of Florida\u2019s charter schools.)\nA Miami Herald investigation in 2011 found charter schools are \"controlled largely by for-profit management companies and private landlords \u2014 one and the same, in many cases \u2014 and rife with insider deals and potential conflicts of interest.\"\nThat distinction is at the heart of Gillum\u2019s critique. He couches his opposition to say he is a critic of for-profit charter schools.\nWhen asked on WPTV in February if he supports the charter school concept, Gillum said \"my issue is not with charters. My issue is with for-profit charter schools who take money away from the public system badly needed in the public system.\"\nGillum made some of his most forceful comments against for-profit involvement in charter schools in a June primary debate.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What we\u2019ve got to do is end this for-profit regime that the Republicans have entered into the public education system here in the state of Florida,\" Gillum said. \"We\u2019ve got to do it immediately. ... I would be completely against for-profit charters in this state.\"\nDuring an August primary debate, Gillum said the governor and Legislature \"have moved more and more of our public dollars out of public schools and into for-profit charter schools. We need to end that.\"\nAfter Gillum won the primary, he continued to criticize for-profit charter schools.\nIn September, the AP paraphrased Gillum as stating that it was time to stop siphoning off public money into privately run schools. Gillum said he would seek to bring the state's current voucher programs to a \"conclusion.\"\nWhile Gillum hasn\u2019t provided a detailed road map to the steps he would take if elected to crack down on for profits, he has made it clear these schools are in his crosshairs, and he views the involvement of for-profit entities as a problem.\nWe asked his campaign to clarify whether he would try to shutter existing charter schools managed by for-profit entities, something that would require buy-in from the state Legislature.\nCampaign spokeswoman Carlie Waibel said Gillum \"will not shut down charter schools,\" saying he wants to bring them more \"transparency and standards.\"\nLynn Norman-Teck, executive director of the Florida Charter School Alliance, disagrees with a blanket condemnation of charter schools that are managed by for profit entities. For some schools, the for profit entity does back office type of work while in others they have a larger role.\n\"We should be looking at the value of a school whether it is a district school or private school or charter,\" she said. \"Let\u2019s look at the return on investment -- are they reaping results? Are those children moving forward?\"\nOur ruling\nDeSantis says Gillum was \"singing a different tune\" about charter schools at the Florida debate.\nThat was a reference to Gillum\u2019s answer to a question about whether he would cut any dollars from charter schools.\nBut Gillum was downplaying his previous comments on charters, saying he would not propose any change to the \"current status quo.\" He went on to say he was \"going to put money into our public system where over 90 percent of our kids are still being educated.\"\nDuring the primary, Gillum had tougher words. He said Florida should \"end this for-profit regime\" immediately, in regard to charter schools managed by for-profit entities, and he called for an \"end\" of moving more public dollars to for-profit charters.\nWhat DeSantis omits is that Gillum hasn\u2019t called for an end to all charter schools \u2014 he is targeting those that are managed by for-profit entities.\nWe rate this claim Mostly True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/5ab672af-b7fc-4876-bccd-f0083d06c6f9", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01371"}
