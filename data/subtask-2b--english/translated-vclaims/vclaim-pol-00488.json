Not exactly, Bill de Blacio.", "text": "On June 26, 10 democratic presidential candidates were asked to raise their hands if they were to cancel private health insurance in favour of a government-run option. Only two said they'd do it: Sin Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts, and the mayor of Bill de Blasieu, New York City. But De Blacio also told the viewers not to take his word for it. He already gave the people of New York City comprehensive health care. Did you already pack up for your move to the big apple? First, let's take a look at the facts. This claim was highlighted by De Blacio at the end of the first democratic presidential debate, who said that voters should review the points of dialogue between his 24 or so democratic rivals and consider what he had done over five years after assuming mayorship. De Blacio said: \"It is important to nominate a candidate to witness the devastation caused by the shattered health care system and to give people comprehensive health care.\" He also referred to the minimum wage in New York City of $15 and the comprehensive kindergarten programme. \"These things are really important,\" he said. \"These are the things I've done in New York, and I want to do the same for this whole country, because putting the workers first, matters.\" There are plans, and the support of skeptics for comprehensive health care has emerged as an early test of the real progress of the democratic candidate for many key voters. So, how does De Blacio measure? Did he really give people \"global health care\"? We asked about the De Blacio campaign, and one speaker referred to the mayor's commitment to \"secure care\" to ensure that every New Yorker had access to health care, a plan that was revealed in January. De Placio said at that time that the two-part plan, estimated at $100 million, would enhance the city's public health insurance option, known as MetroPlus - including efforts to register more qualified but not yet insured persons. It also \"secures\" access to the city's hospital and general clinic system for those who are not eligible for insurance. The word \"unqualified\" refers in particular to those who cannot afford insurance or are unable to register because they are undocumented migrants. In May, the Mayor &apos; s Office estimated that 300,000 New Yorkers met the requirements of the bill. There is a new programme at the heart of the plan, called Care NYC, aimed at helping the unqualified. Uninsured persons - who have lived in New York City for at least six months - will be associated with a primary care doctor; access to a variety of specialized care, including mental health and drug abuse services; affordable prescription drugs; and a 24-hour customer service number, which they can contact for appointments. The costs of services will be charged on a step-by-step scale. On January 14, 2021, Chuck Grasley stated in a tweet that insulin prices had \"lost the RoOOF for patients/taxpayers bc from the manufacturer, a health plan and PBM Biz practices.\" By Madison Black: 2 February 2021, but care in New York is not an insurance plan. As of 27 June, the City Public Health System - Health + Hospitals in New York - advises visitors to its website that \"from the summer of 2019, there will be different ways to sign.\" Bill Hammond, Director of Health Policy at the Empire Public Policy Centre, a non-partisan think tank focusing on New York, said. The voters may believe that it refers to universal insurance or even to a single payment system, as he said, which one is incorrect. What De Plasio gives New Yorkers are new ways to access current services, as Hammond said. And while it might be a good thing, he said, it sounds like \"reconfigured.\" Not only has the City of New York had the Metro Blues and Mammouth system of public hospitals and other medical facilities for many years, but the task of treating those who cannot afford the care costs, including undocumented migrants, has long been one of the health hospitals + New York Convention hospitals. Hammond said, \"He makes it look like he skipped the \"Health for All\" program in New York City. \"He didn't even approach.\" The claim of De Blasieu is further complicated by its use to provoke the past - that it \"provides\" comprehensive health care to New Yorkers. It is expected that the plan will be implemented over time, starting with the Bronx, and that it will cover all five neighbourhoods by the end of 2020. (It was originally scheduled to be \"full available\" in 2021, but by the time De Blacio announced his presidency in mid-May, that date was moved.) It is expected that the New York Convention sponsorship institution will be launched in the Bronx on 1 August. Our rule, De Blacio, said he gave the New Yorkers comprehensive health care. According to WHO, \"universal health coverage\" means that anyone can use the health services they need, which are of good quality enough to be effective, without being exposed to financial difficulties. There is no doubt that De Blacio unveiled a plan in January that includes a new programme aimed at giving anyone (who lived in New York City for at least six months) access to the famous New York public health system at a price commensurate with their financial situation. But most of the time, De Blacio has not created a new system as much as he has made sure that the people of New York can use the system they own - and we still have to see how its methods will go well. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that give a different impression. So we evaluate it mostly wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00488"}
