Dan Patrick said the current border crisis is at a level he's never seen before. Patrick &apos; s part appeared one dimension around the birth rate from 2017, when more than 3.8 million births were registered throughout the country, the lowest in 30 years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Patrick said: \"This will manipulate you, referring to Dobbs' birth rate report. We'll have more people entering our country illegally than those born in this country in one year. \"We are moving at a fast pace to arrest a million people who are illegally crossing into this country. Anyone in the law enforcement forces who talks to him - a local sheriff, our state police - will tell you that they have arrested one in four or five. That means that if we catch a million, there's another four million.\" Patrick's claim is wrong. No matter how generous we are and we cut the numbers back, his calculations don't add up. Patrick, under the assessment of the arrest of Alejandro Garcia, Patrick &apos; s spokesman, referred to a few different sources of this allegation: news reports on birth rates, projected border arrests for the coming year and a study indicating that the country &apos; s illegal population is much higher than previously recorded. Let us begin with the expected border concerns. The ABC News Garcia reported that \"the border authorities expect that the number of undocumented migrants arrested at the southern border could reach 1 million by the end of the year, which could double last year's level.\" The only problem here, as the article notes, is that this estimate \"covers illegal transit and persons arriving at ports of entry.\" Similar allegations have been made in the past by federal officials, with the same warning, that their estimates accuse both arrests of individuals who cross illegally and law enforcement confrontations with individuals at ports of entry who aspire to enter the country legally. An analysis of the facts found that a more accurate estimate is that the federal authorities are on track to make 643,306 of this fiscal year &apos; s concerns, the time frame that customs and United States border protection view when tracking arrests. This number is based on the average fear of the first five months of the fiscal year, which runs from October to September. There are now two additional months of available data, increasing the monthly average. Those responsible are now on their way to some 789,000 cases of fear this fiscal year. It is also possible to arrive at a similar estimate for the calendar year; Patrick did not specify the period under consideration. Given the monthly average of about 76,700 arrests in the first four months of the year, officials look forward to the right course of action for some 920,400 arrests in this calendar year. Patrick was mistaken in one of the 4 (or 5) allegations, and Garcia referred to a study published by researchers at Yale University School of Administration to support the latter part of Patrick's claim: that only one in four or five people were arrested by agents trying to enter the country illegally. On February 1, 2021, Tom Cotton mentioned in an interview with Fox and friends \"Many of these arriving immigrants, we have no way of checking their background for either health or security.\" The study examined the number of undocumented immigrants living in the United States and found that the average population was estimated at 22.1 million in 2016 - \"mainly twice the current widely accepted estimate\" of 11.3 million. However, Edward Kaplan, a professor at Yale University who authored the study, said that the high population did not mean that individuals crossed the border at the rate suggested by Patrick. \"We do not appreciate that 5 million people crossed the border illegally in any one year during our study,\" Kaplan said in an e-mail, noting that the highest number of border crossings reported in the study was in 2000, when it was estimated that 2.6 million people crossed the border illegally. There is an important aspect here: many experts raised concerns about the validity of Yale's study, including researchers at the Institute of Migration Policy who said that its findings were based on \"seriously flawed assumptions\" about migration patterns and census data. Stephen Kamaruta, Director of Research at the Centre for Migration Studies, was among the researchers who criticized the results. He called his conclusions \"unsupported\" in a post for the Centre, which called for low levels of migration. We asked Kamaruta to take a look at Patrick's claim. Despite an increase in concerns over previous years, Kamaruta said that much less than 4 million people would cross the border illegally this year. Even if Patrick &apos; s claim was limited to the mere birth of Native Americans (which in 2017 had estimated Kamaruta to be some 3.1 million) or if estimates were included for persons who had exceeded their visa in his account for illegal crossings, the percentage was nil. \"The bottom line is that it does not seem possible to get 4 million,\" Camarota said, referring to the number of births registered in 2017. The Ministry of National Security provides estimates of border arrest rates and the number of persons who successfully entered the country illegally, based in part on data that can be observed reported by agents on the ground and statistical models. A report on border security measures published in February used two different accounts to estimate that customers at the southern border had arrested about 65 per cent to 75 per cent of persons who had attempted to enter the country illegally in fiscal year 2017. A separate report published by the Bureau of Migration Statistics in 2017 stated that agents arrested 55 per cent to 85 per cent of all individuals trying to cross, according to the estimates. The report of the Demographic and Health Survey also contains estimates of \"departure,\" people who have been seen crossing the border successfully while fleeing arrest, and \"complete and successful illegal interventions,\" a number calculated through statistical models and data that can be observed. There were an estimated 104,000 \"departed\" in 2017 (a decrease of 83 per cent from 615,000 in 2006) and 160,000 \"total successful illegal entry\" in 2017 (a decrease of 92 per cent from 2.1 million in 2000). Our Governor Patrick said, \"We will have more people entering our country illegally than they were born in this country in one year.\" There is no evidence to support Patrick &apos; s claim. While it is difficult to determine how many people enter the country successfully illegally while avoiding detection, it is safe to say that the real number is much lower than Patrick's 5 million. We're assessing this pants claim on fire. Note: This is not the first time that Patrick has filed such an action. In 2014, it was proposed that more people be arrested after illegally crossing the United States-Mexico border a week \"from being born in Texas every week.\" That was true (at the time).
