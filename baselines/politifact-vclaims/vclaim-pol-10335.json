Jim Langevin has received $20 million from taxpayers and special interests while in office to use at his own discretion", "text": "Michael Riley, the Republican businessman who wants to end Democrat U.S. Rep. James Langevin\u2019s six-term run as congressman from Rhode Island\u2019s 2nd District, unleashed new television and radio commercials last week, ripping into Langevin as a ravenous devourer of taxpayer money.\n\nThe radio ad opens with the menacing music from the movie \"Jaws\" in the background, as the narrator says Langevin has \"received almost $20 million from taxpayers and special interests while in office to use at his own discretion to supposedly champion Rhode Island\u2019s needs. \"\n\nThe ad recites a list of problems, from high gas prices to unemployment, \u00a0and claims Langevin has few policy accomplishments to show for the money he\u2019s received.\n\n\"Beware Rhode Island!\" the narrator warns. \"There\u2019s a shark in the water, circling the Ocean State and looking to feast on your hard-earned tax dollars! That shark\u2019s name is Jim Langevin.\"\n\nWe\u2019ll pass on the value of Langevin\u2019s policy achievements; one party\u2019s success is another\u2019s crime against the Constitution. But there is an \u00a0objective element of Riley\u2019s claim that can be examined: Has Langevin gotten nearly $20 million \"from taxpayers and special interests ... to use at his own discretion\" in his congressional career?\n\nWe called the Riley campaign for their backup. Spokesman \u00a0Nicholas Tsimortos told us the number is the sum of three elements:\n\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJake Tapper\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in remarks in a CNN broadcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second presidential impeachment of Donald Trump was \u201cthe most bipartisan impeachment in American history.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe almost $2 million Langevin has been paid in salary during his 12 years in Congress.\n\nThe more than $6 million that\u2019s been donated to Langevin\u2019s campaigns since he first ran in 2000.\n\nThe $11 million spent to pay the staffers who have worked for him over those 12 years.\n\n\n\nAdd them up and they come to more than $18 million, hence \"almost $20 million.\"\n\nStep one is figuring out if Riley\u2019s numbers are right.\n\nFor Langevin\u2019s campaign contribution totals, we went to Opensecrets.org, a campaign-finance database compiled by the nonprofit Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nAccording to its records, Langevin has raised $6,253,061 over his six previous campaigns and in his current one, through Aug. 22. So Riley\u2019s campaign got that number right.\n\nHow about the $2 million in cumulative salary? When Langevin took office in January 2001, U.S. representatives got $145,100 annually; it\u2019s up to $174,000 now. Add up Langevin\u2019s total salary over those years and it\u2019s $1,965,700, close enough to call it almost \"$2 million.\"\n\nLast, and not least, is the $11 million that Riley\u2019s campaign says Langevin has spent on staff salaries. For that, we went to Legistorm.com, which tracks congressional office spending. According to that site, $11,021,686 was paid to the 63 people who have worked on Langevin\u2019s federally financed staff over his congressional career. That\u2019s in line with Tsimortos\u2019 $11-million estimate.\n\nSo the numbers add up.\n\nBut accurate information can be put in a misleading context. And the context of Riley\u2019s claim -- portraying the congressman as a shark devouring taxpayer dollars -- is highly misleading.\n\nThe first course of this alleged fiscal buffet is Langevin\u2019s nearly $2 million in congressional pay. Article I, Section 6 of the U.S. Constitution requires that representatives be paid.\n\nLangevin may have discretion on how he spends his salary, but there\u2019s nothing sinister about his accepting the same compensation every other congressman receives -- and the same salary Riley would receive if he wins.\n\nWhat about the $6 million in campaign contributions? Riley\u2019s campaign says all that money comes from \"special interests.\" \u00a0Even if we were to agree with that characterization -- and most independent analysts don\u2019t \u00a0-- federal law limits what candidates can do with contributions. They can be used for commercials, polling and campaign staff, for example, but not a candidate\u2019s personal expenses.\n\n(According to his most recent filings, Riley has given $440,200 to his campaign and accepted $69,363 in contributions.)\n\nFinally, \u00a0what about the $11 million Langevin\u2019s office has spent in staff salaries?\n\nAccording to the U.S. House of Representatives\u2019 House Administration Committee website, each congressman gets an annual allowance for office salaries and expenses. It fluctuates from year to year, but has hovered at about $1 million recently.\n\nStaffers spend much of their time helping constituents having problems with, say the Social Security Administration or the Veterans Administration. And they research issues, providing representatives with the information they need to decide how to vote.\n\nMaybe Langevin could have decided not to have a staff and saved the taxpayers $11 million, but it would have meant Rhode Island\u2019s 2nd District constituents would be less efficiently represented.\n\nOur ruling\n\nMichael Riley\u2019s campaign ad says Rep. James Langevin \"has received almost $20 million from taxpayers and special interests to use at his own discretion to supposedly champion Rhode Island\u2019s needs.\"\n\nWhen you add Langevin\u2019s salary, his staff salaries and his campaign contributions, you do get nearly $20 million.\n\nBut Riley\u2019s claim -- and the ad\u2019s portrayal of Langevin as a shark looking to \"feast\" on taxpayers\u2019 dollars -- suggests he has a slush fund and has used it improperly.\n\nThat\u2019s a gross distortion of very common practices allowed by law and the U.S. Constitution.
