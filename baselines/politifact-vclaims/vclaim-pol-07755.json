Are cops being kept off the street?\nWhen we asked Vos for backup, his office cited news accounts, city budget documents and testimony from Milwaukee Police Association president Michael Crivello at a Sept. 19, 2013 meeting of the city Fire and Police Commission.\nUnder Barrett, the city began using the unpaid days off for all staffers in 2009 to address budget issues. Police officers have been involved, to varying degrees, since the practice began. City officials maintain that furloughs have been used selectively, at least when they come to cops.\nFor instance, in the first year \"only a limited number of MPD sworn staff was required to have furloughs,\" said Mark Nicolini, the city\u2019s budget director.\nFurloughs expanded to all officers in 2010. There were no furlough days for sworn staff in 2011 or 2012. Furloughs returned in 2013, when all police department staff took three days.\nThe same number was included in the 2014 budget.\nTo be sure, the furloughs are not a product of the mayor and police chief alone.\nThe Fire and Police Commission unanimously approved the 2014 plan at a Sept. 19, 2013 meeting.\nAnd the Common Council voted 15-0 in favor of the furloughs, which for the police would save a projected $1.75 million, according to the city\u2019s budget office. Savings from all city employees is expected to be $3.3 million.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Godlewski\n\n\nstated on January 9, 2021 in Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all women that lost jobs (in the December jobs report), it was mostly Black and Latina women.

Mark Stanmeyer, said in an email: \"Furloughs have no impact on the minimum staffing levels set and maintained by MPD.\"\n\"The operational impact of furloughs is that it becomes slightly more difficult for an officer to receive permission to use a compensatory day, vacation day, holiday or other contractually accrued leave time. \u00a0In order to mitigate this impact, furloughs are scheduled throughout the entire year.\"\nCrivello, the union president, told the commission that he opposes furloughs \"due to public safety, police safety, morale, and lack of documentation illustrating other means of budgetary relief.\"\nAsked in an interview about the city\u2019s claim that furloughs don\u2019t affect minimum staffing, Crivello did some basic math.\nWith about 1,600 cops forced to take three days off, \"that\u2019s 4,800 man days we\u2019re losing to furloughs,\" he said. \"That means that every day there are 13 to 14 officers that are not on the street.\"\nHe said the furloughs affect officer safety because they contribute to fewer two-man squad cars, and reduce response time for when officers call for backup assistance.\nCrivello also said furloughs also hurt morale.\nOur rating\nVos said the mayor and police chief were furloughing police officers.\nBut Vos places the blame for them solely on Barrett and Flynn, when the responsibility is shared by the council and Fire and Police Commission. \u00a0What\u2019s more, it\u2019s a longstanding practice to deal with budget issues and steps have been taken to mitigate the impact on public safety.\nWe rate the claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07755"}
