In a radio ad that debuted Feb. 25, Turner accuses Workman of voting for Democrats.\n\n\"Official records show he voted in the Democrat primary, supporting Democrats with his vote,\" the narrator says.\n\nIndeed?\n\nCraig Murphy, Turner's spokesman, pointed to Travis County's voting records.\n\nOur search shows that Workman voted in the 1994 Democratic primary, though he voted in the two previous GOP primaries and in eight Republican primaries from 1996 through 2010.\n\nSo over 20 years, Workman voted in every Republican primary except for one in '94.\n\nWhat caused Workman to cross party lines and vote Democratic? We didn't find out; his campaign consultant, Eric Bearse, said Workman \"doesn't recall voting in that primary.\"\n\nThe record shows he did.\n\nWe rate Turner's statement as True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-15269"}
