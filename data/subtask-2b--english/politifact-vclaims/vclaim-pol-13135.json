Ron Paul says prices are increasing and unemployment is continuing to increase", "text": "U.S. Rep. Ron Paul is courting the belly vote.\n\nDuring the first 2012 presidential debate in South Carolina on Thursday, the Texas Republican said the economy will cause President Barack Obama\u2019s re-election efforts to suffer.\n\n\"My theory is that people vote from their bellies because it\u2019s whether they\u2019re hungry or not or have jobs and need things, that\u2019s why people vote,\" Paul said. \"And we\u2019re in big trouble. Prices are going up, unemployment is continuing to go up.\"\n\nWe decided to check whether both prices and unemployment are rising.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the former.\n\nCheryl Abbot, an economist at the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, told us that prices are almost always going up because of inflation \u2014 the question is whether prices have been increasing at a faster rate as of late.\n\nAnd the answer is yes. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 Consumer Price Index, year-over-year inflation rate has been accelerating since November 2010, when the rate was 1.1 percent. The bureau\u2019s most recent data is from March, when the inflation rate was 2.7 percent.\n\nThe price spike is \"almost entirely due to gasoline prices,\" Abbot said. Take gasoline prices out of the picture, and the rate change is nominal, she said.\n\nWhat about unemployment?\n\nFlash back to January 2008, when the unemployment rate stood at a mere 5 percent. By October 2009, it was 10.1 percent. During most of 2010, unemployment hovered just below 10 percent, peaking in November at 9.8 percent.\n\nBut since then, the rate has fallen every month, dropping to 8.8 percent in March.\n\nUntil today, that is, when the the bureau reported that unemployment ticked up two-tenths of a point, to 9 percent, in April.\n\nThat\u2019s still high by historical standards, Abbot said, but she quibbles with Paul\u2019s claim that unemployment \"continues to go up.\"\n\nSo do we. We have no qualms with Paul\u2019s price claim, but unemployment has dropped steadily for four of the last five months. And the labor bureau didn\u2019t report April\u2019s uptick until after Paul made his debate talking point.\n\nWe rate the statement Half True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13135"}
