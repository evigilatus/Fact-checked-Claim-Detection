Stockman appeared at this week's round table with Christian Amanpour on May 1 to put forward similar arguments. Before the round table, Amanpur interviewed Lord Paul Ryan, R-Wisc. In his capacity as Chairman of the Budget Committee of the House of Representatives, he developed a broad budget proposal, which was approved by the United States House of Representatives on 15 April, often along the lines of the parties. It is unlikely that the proposal will become law; Democrats in the Senate and President Barack Obama oppose the plan. Stokeman didn't have nice words for Ryan's scheme. \"I think both parties are delusional in thinking that this is a long-term problem. Ryan's plan gets a balanced budget in 2030, later financial. We have a problem here and now, \"Stockman said. \"Now, what does Ryan do in the next two or three years? Nothing. $600 billion (billions of dollars) or $700 billion in spending, mostly from a small portion of the budget, reduces discretion and safety net, leaves medical care untouched for three years, leaves social security untouched for 10 years, leaves the defence untouched at all over the next three years, and, therefore, after cutting this small amount, repeats it all by extending all tax cuts that we cannot afford in Bush. .................................................................................... In three years, he doesn't cut one cent of the debt.\" On January 13, 2021, the distinguished fact-checkers mentioned a story in which General David H. Berger, the commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for the use of marines for securitization security, and said, \"We are not working for you.\" By Samantha Butterman: January 17, 2021, we decided to verify the truth of Stockman's attack on Ryan's proposal. We will take it a point with truth decisions or meter along the way to our final judgment. Ryan's proposal leaves medical care completely untouched for three years. Ryan's decision specifically exempts current retirees who are about to retire. This means that traditional medical care will remain in place for those aged 55 or over. So that we don't see reductions in the rate of spending on medical care until 2022. Ryan's budget proposal, as approved by the House of Representatives, is just a blueprint, but Ryan's employees have provided additional details of his plan to the non-partisan budget office in Congress, and he's been able to find out what he's up to. According to the Community Bureau, the Ryan Plan leaves a number of cost-saving provisions that are part of health care reform, but these cost savings are part of the current law, not new reductions. So Ryan's budget doesn't leave medical care alone in the short run. On this point, Stokeman is on fixed ground, and we appreciate this point right. Ryan's proposal leaves social security completely untouched for 10 years. Ryan's book \"The Home to Prosperity\" confirms that social security is out of balance and in \"a fragile situation,\" but does not propose immediate changes to the programme. Instead, the proposal provides for the President to present a plan for the rebalancing of the Fund, and for members of Congress to also be asked to put forward ideas. The report of the Central Bureau clearly states, \"The proposal does not involve changes in social security.\" Stockman's accurate here too, and we're assessing his statement correctly. Ryan's proposal leaves the defense completely untouched for the next three years. Ryan's budget proposal accepts the cuts already proposed by Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, but he doesn't propose any further cuts. The proposed budget for Ryan uses the same figures for defence spending as the proposed budget for the White House for 2012, although Obama has since proposed further reductions in defence. Reductions amount to $78 billion over the next five years, while a small number of people considered defence received some $720 billion in 2011 alone. Ryan's budget slows the growth of defense spending in the future, but it doesn't actually reduce it. Ryan's proposal explicitly stated that the Government's first function was national defence and rejected \"deep cuts across the board in national defence funding.\" (At this point, Ryan's proposal attracted critics alike to a proposal that is too much and too little. Commenting on the liberal Kato Institute, the defense must be cut off more while one of the Conservative Heritage Foundation says that spending isn't enough to achieve American security goals. We checked the proposal numbers with Todd Harrison, a defense budget expert at the Center for Strategy and Budget, a defense-focused research institute. Even with the proposed reduction of Gates, \"the DOD budget will not actually fall -- it will remain essentially constant (growth only with inflation) for the next 12 years,\" said Harrison by e-mail. We assess this part mostly true, allowing the fact that there are some small cuts agreed upon by Ryan and Obama's administration alike. In three years, Ryan \"don't cut one cent of the debt.\" As Stockman noted in his comments, Ryan's proposal does not reduce some estimated expenditure in the short term. But this is not enough to make a decline in public debt. Take into account what religion is: it's the sum of all the money we borrowed. On the other hand, the deficit is the annual deficit. Therefore, making the deficit lower every year does not reduce debt. As long as the annual deficit remains, the debt will increase each year. Ryan's proposal reduces the deficit but does not remove it until 2040, 29 years from now, according to the analysis of community organizations. The \"Strengthen to Prosperity\" document contains projections of public debt between 2011 and 2021, and it has been shown that debt rises each year. Congress is now discussing an increase in the debt ceiling from its current level of $14.3 trillion; Ryan &apos; s budget shows an increase in debt to $16.2 trillion in 2012 and an increase each year thereafter to $23.1 trillion in 2021. So Stockman's right about that, too. Oh, right. Other views were investigated by Ryan's office to respond to Stockman's complaints. The speaker described Ryan's plan as \"phased reforms of the general sense,\" noting that it reduces the deficit compared to current policy and the budget of President Obama. \"Economic growth, combined with a genuine solution to the rising costs of health care, is the key to putting our budget on a balance path and our economy on the path of prosperity. Tax increases kill growth, and simply reducing benefits for current older persons is not a real solution to rising health-care costs,\" said Connor Sweeney by e-mail. In the meantime, we must point out that liberal critics who hate Ryan's plan will also disagree with Stockman's criticism. Short-term spending should not be curbed because, as they said, it would be detrimental to economic recovery. How did the New York Times columnist Paul Krugman write recently: \"Why don't we cut the deficit right away? Because tax increases and cuts in government spending would lead to further contraction of economies, exacerbating unemployment. Reducing spending in a highly depressed economy leads to self-inflicted even purely financial failure: savings achieved at the end of the front are partly offset by a decline in income, with the contraction of the economy. There is no doubt that our judgement as to whether the deficit should be reduced quickly or slowly is a debate that will continue to burn. \u2219 (Stockman) urges a dramatic approach to rapidly reducing spending and increasing taxes, while Ryan &apos; s proposal presents a more gradual approach to spending cuts, and does not call for higher taxes. Stockman said Ryan's plan \"Leave medical care completely untouched for three years, leave social security completely untouched for ten years, and leave the defense completely untouched for the next three years, .................................................................................... In three years, he doesn't cut one cent of the debt.\" Stokeman is very accurate at all these points, and we're assessing his statements correctly.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13150"}
