The conference focused on improving the lives of women around the world. The Carter Center\u2019s website says prior conferences have helped combat issues such as human trafficking and sexual violence. Carter, a former Georgia governor, was scheduled as a speaker.\n\nCarter cites the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution for his argument that the death penalty should be considered unconstitutional, said Deanna Congileo, a spokeswoman for Carter. There\u2019s plenty of debate about what that amendment says about the Constitution, which we\u2019ll visit later in this article. As for whether the U.S. government says people can be put to death, there\u2019s a long history of federal executions.\n\nThere have been 37 federal prisoners executed since 1927, according to the U.S. Bureau of Prisons. The most notable U.S. execution took place in June 2001, when Timothy McVeigh, convicted of the 1995 Oklahoma City federal building bombing that killed 168 people, was executed by lethal injection in a federal prison in Indiana. The last federal execution was in 2003.\n\nU.S. Attorney General Eric Holder has authorized several death penalty prosecutions since he took office in 2009. In 2011, he revised some procedures on how federal prosecutors can consider death penalty cases.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, does the Constitution say people can be put to death? There\u2019s healthy legal debate among scholars and jurists concerning that argument.\n\nThe Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution says no one can be held for a capital crime \"except by due process of law.\" Death penalty proponents say that language confirms its legality. Capital punishment opponents contend the words \"cruel and unusual punishments inflicted\" in the Eighth Amendment is an indictment of the death penalty and its legality.\n\nThe state of Georgia has been the genesis for many of the questions concerning whether the Constitution allows the death penalty, with two landmark U.S. Supreme Court rulings, one occurring when Carter was elected president in 1976.\n\nIn the 1972 case, Furman v. Georgia, the Supreme Court concluded that the arbitrary application of the death penalty and the disproportionate number of minorities that were executed made the death penalty \"unusual.\" By declining to rule that capital punishment was unconstitutional in and of itself, however, the Supreme Court left the door open for state legislatures to draw more narrowly construed death penalty statutes.\n\nIn 1976, Georgia's newly written death penalty statute was challenged before the Supreme Court in Gregg v. Georgia. This time, Georgia won. The Supreme Court ruled the death penalty could be used under careful conditions.\n\nThe website ProCon.org highlights the dispute. It contains a quote from former U.S. Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan disagreeing with the Gregg v. Georgia ruling, saying it violated the Eighth Amendment. Brennan later expressed his moral objections to the death penalty. Next to Brennan\u2019s quote on the website is a quote from the current chief justice, John G. Roberts Jr. In a 2008 ruling, Roberts wrote that a method of execution \"cannot be viewed as probative of the wanton infliction of pain under the Eighth Amendment.\"\n\nTo sum up, Carter claimed the federal government and the U.S. Constitution say people can be put to death. The U.S. attorney general\u2019s office has guidelines on prosecuting such cases, and the Supreme Court has ruled capital punishment can be employed under the Constitution, although there is still much discussion about its interpretation.\n\nWe rate Carter\u2019s claim True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09154"}
