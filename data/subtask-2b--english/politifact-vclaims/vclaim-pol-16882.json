The accompanying text claims it happened at a 2019 rally in Wisconsin.\nHere\u2019s the post:\nJOE BIDEN WANTS THIS PICTURE OFF THE INTERNET BUT WE NEED TO KEEP SHARING IT\nMAGA\nKAGA\nStory: In 2019, Joe Biden was confronted by 63 year old Melinda Bares at a rally in Wisconsin. Bares claimed Biden was trying to take guns from law abiding citizens, to which Biden claimed \"guns are just as dangerous as poison and knives, and I will prove it!\" He then held a gun to Bares, and said she is even more scared than normal.\n\nIt was posted March 23, 2020, but began circulating heavily in early April. The comments showed many Facebook users taking it seriously, calling Biden \"evil\" and asserting this as further reason to support Bernie Sanders.\nBut the image is fabricated.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin LeMahieu\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a TV interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It takes quite a while on Election Day to load those ballots, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s the background.\nPicture dates back more than a decade\nThe \"story\" accompanying the photo is pure fiction. Biden didn\u2019t even attend any public events in Wisconsin in 2019, according to records maintained by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\nThe original picture is from a Sept. 2, 2008, rally in Deerfield Beach, Fla. It was taken by an Associated Press photographer and published in an online Washington Post story that same day.\n\nThe woman is 87, not 63, and her name is Annalou Trebitz, according to the original caption. There are other clues to the age of the photo, like the \"Seniors for Obama\" sticker on Trebitz\u2019s jacket.\nThe picture \u2014 with the gun digitally inserted into the scene \u2014 has been circulating online since at least May 2012, according to Snopes, which fact-checked the picture (rating it False) in January 2017.\nOur ruling\nA picture and caption making the rounds on Facebook claims to show Joe Biden sticking a gun in a woman\u2019s mouth at a 2019 rally in Wisconsin.\nIt\u2019s actually an altered photo from a 2008 event in Florida, with the gun digitally added. It\u2019s been circulating online for at least eight years.\nAnd Biden wasn\u2019t even here in 2019.\nThis is a ridiculous fabrication and a malicious lie.\u00a0Since we don't have any stronger rating to use, we rate this post Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16882"}
