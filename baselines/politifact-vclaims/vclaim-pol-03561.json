He noted the former president had decided to stay in Washington, and not for the reasons Obama has given.\n\"He\u2019s only there for one purpose and one purpose only,\" Kelly said, \"and that is to run a shadow government that is gonna totally upset the new agenda.\" \u00a0\nIs that really what Obama stayed in Washington, D.C. to do?\nObama announced late in 2016 he\u2019d be sticking around in Washington for at least two years so his daughter Sasha could finish high school. He has office space paid for by the General Services Administration, a perk granted to all former presidents. According to the Chicago Sun Times, Obama is the first president since Woodrow Wilson to stay at a primary residence in Washington, D.C. after his tenure ended.\nObama will be assisting former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder in a Congressional redistricting effort, work Holder has described as a \"going into the states\" strategy. Holder also said Obama would be fundraising and interacting with state legislators. \u00a0\u00a0\nNo reports or intelligence has been released linking these post-presidency activities of Obama to a shadow government. And Kelly did not provide any evidence. A shadow government is commonly defined as a conflicting, secondary government led by members of the private sector that wields similar influence to the actual government.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPat Toomey\n\n\nstated on January 19, 2021 in a hearing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere will be several thousand dollars in payments going to families with six-figure incomes who\u2019ve had no income interruption whatsoever.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jessica Calefati \u2022 January 21, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKelly later withdrew his comments after they made national news. His spokesperson Tom Qualtere said, \"Because of the extraordinary interest in Rep. Kelly\u2019s remarks, it is worth clarifying that Rep. Kelly does not believe that President Obama is personally operating a shadow government.\" In another statement, Qualtere said, \"he was sharing the frustration of everyone in the room over how they believe certain Obama administration holdovers within the federal bureaucracy are attempting to upset President Trump\u2019s agenda.\"\nKelly\u2019s comments and his ensuing walkback landed in The Washington Post, The Huffington Post, The Hill and MSNBC. Aaron Blake, for the Post, wrote \"while the conspiracy theory is strange enough, the explanations offered by Kelly's office are something to behold.\"\nA spokesperson for Obama did not respond to a request for comment.\nOur Ruling \nCongressman Mike Kelly accused President Barack Obama of operating a shadow government, saying he was only staying in Washington, D.C. for that \"one purpose and one purpose only.\" Yet there is no evidence Obama is running a shadow government, and Obama has provided another purpose for why he\u2019s staying in Washington: so his daughter Sasha can finish high school.
