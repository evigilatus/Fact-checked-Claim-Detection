(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nPosts like this misinterpret the way economists define shareholder capitalism, and they take Biden\u2019s comments out of context to give a misleading impression.\u00a0\nIn urging an end to the \"era of shareholder capitalism,\" the Democratic nominee was talking about a change in the prevailing view that corporations should primarily seek to benefit their shareholders. He was saying that corporations should stop prioritizing shareholder value without regard for the well-being of their employees and communities.\u00a0\nHere\u2019s what Biden said in context:\u00a0\n\"It\u2019s way past time to put an end to the era of shareholder capitalism \u2014 the idea [that] the only responsibility a corporation has is to its shareholders. That\u2019s simply not true. It\u2019s an absolute farce. They have responsibility to their workers, their community, to their country. That isn\u2019t [a] new or radical notion. These are basic values and principles that helped build this nation in the first instance. Now the challenge is to take these fundamental values, and apply them to the new economy we have to build in the years ahead\u2026 .\"\nAs the context makes clear, Biden was taking a position in a long-running ethical debate about the way corporations should behave. He wasn\u2019t calling for the end of shareholding altogether, as the Facebook post suggests.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe economic theory that Biden was critiquing \u2014 shareholder capitalism \u2014 holds that corporations are accountable primarily to their shareholders. Economist Milton Friedman, a noted proponent of shareholder capitalism, summed up the theory this way: \"There is one and only one social responsibility of business \u2014 to use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits.\"\nDefenders of Friedman\u2019s theory argue that it ultimately benefits employees and the community, because corporations focused principally on shareholder value have a vested interest in maintaining a loyal workforce and avoiding negative publicity. Critics believe it has led to widespread economic inequality by disproportionately benefiting shareholders at the expense of others involved in the company. They also contend that it has produced a self-serving corporate mindset, providing ethical justification for tax evasion, low wages for workers and practices that degrade the environment.\u00a0\nLike many other critics of shareholder capitalism, Biden believes in \"stakeholder\" capitalism, a\u00a0 view of business ethics that is emerging as the norm in Europe and was popular in the U.S. in the 1950s and 60s. The stakeholder theory of capitalism holds that corporations should operate in ways that benefit all people who hold a \"stake\" in the company: customers, suppliers, employees, shareholders and local communities. Rather than maximizing short-term profits for the sake of shareholders, the theory holds, companies should strive to give back to their stakeholders to guarantee their long-term health.\nBiden\u2019s claim that corporations \"have a responsibility to their workers, their community, to their country\" is a clear elaboration of classic stakeholder theory.\nThe same view has been embraced by some segments of the U.S. business community.\nIt\u2019s inaccurate to say that ending the predominance of shareholder capitalism would get rid of people\u2019s 401(k)s, pensions and retirement savings.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post claimed that Biden \"wants to end Shareholder Capitalism.. that's your 401k..your pensions.. your retirement.. are you voting for that???\"\nBiden said the era of shareholder capitalism should end.\nBut the full context of his remarks shows he was calling for corporations to stop maximizing short-term profits for shareholders over the well-being of their communities. He was not calling for the abolition of stock market investments.\nThe post misinterpreted the definition of shareholder capitalism to give a misleading impression.
