Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Kentucky\u2019s Democratic Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes has devolved into a battle of silly Internet memes.\nThat\u2019s ironic, The Daily Show alum said, because a good chunk of Kentuckians can\u2019t even get online.\n\"The people of Kentucky deserve everyone\u2019s sympathy, or at least the one\u2019s with Internet access,\" Oliver said. \"Here\u2019s an interesting fact: 28 percent of Kentuckians don\u2019t have any online access, a commodity the U.N. had deemed a basic human right. Even Alaska has that number down to 18 percent and they had to lay cable through 1,300 miles of narwhal.\"\nWe\u2019re sticking to the fact-check about Kentucky\u2019s connected population (but for what it\u2019s worth, narwhals are not indigenous to Alaska.)\nDefining Internet access\nWe reached out to a producer for Last Week Tonight for the source of the claim. She pointed us to U.S. Census Bureau data from the 2012 current population survey.\nThe survey found that 71.9 percent of Kentuckians reported accessing the Internet either from within their home or outside the home (school, local library, etc.). That ranks 39th in the country.\nThe inverse, then, would mean 28.1 percent in the state don\u2019t have access to the Internet, right?\nNot exactly. Just because someone doesn\u2019t have Internet, doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have access to it.\nTypically, Internet \"access\"\u00a0as a noun\u00a0is discussed in terms of whether those services would be available if people wanted them. Oliver was measuring it a different way: by the percentage of people who say they actually use the Internet (as in access the verb).\nEach state collects data every six months on broadband availability to residents in every part of the state and sends it to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, a part of the Commerce Department. That information is put together to create the National Broadband Map, which shows how connected each community is to the Internet.\nAccording to the data, 94.4 percent of people in Kentucky have access to at least Internet speeds of 3 megabits per second (we know that\u2019s not very fast, but we\u2019ll get to that shortly).\nWhat Oliver forgets to factor in is some people choose not to connect to the Internet, even though it is available.\nWhy would someone make that choice? According to Census data, about half of people nationwide said they don\u2019t have Internet because they don\u2019t want it or don\u2019t think they need it.\nAnother 28 percent of people said the cost is too prohibitive, while 13 percent said they don\u2019t have a computer at all.\nSo, clearly for some people, access to affordable Internet is as problematic as access to Internet as a whole. But it\u2019s hard to know for how many Kentuckians that was a factor.\nNeed for speed\nLet\u2019s get back to speed for a second, though, because this is where Oliver\u2019s point is well taken, even if the numbers are off.\nInternet speed of 3 megabits per second is considered \"basic.\" But as University of Kentucky professor Michael Childress notes, \"basic level of broadband speed is no longer sufficient for many important applications,\" such as distance learning.\nIn this realm, Kentuckians are at a disadvantage compared to other states, and the disparity between Kentucky and more connected states increases the faster speeds get.\nFor starters, while getting Internet at speeds 3 mbps to 94 percent of the state seems like an accomplishment, Kentucky actually ranks 47th in the country, ahead of only Montana, Vermont and Alaska. (Side note: Given Oliver\u2019s comments, it\u2019s interesting to see Alaska here. Even though Oliver was right that a higher percentage of Alaskans are hooked up to the Internet at home, a smaller percentage of residents have access to the broadband grid, and that doesn\u2019t change at higher Internet speeds.)\nSmaller, urban states have an easier time getting their residents access to higher speeds. In New Jersey, for example, 97 percent of the population can access download speeds greater than 50 mbps. Only 58.4 percent of Kentuckians have that luxury.\nHere\u2019s a chart looking at the percentage of Kentuckians with access to the Internet at varying speeds compared to the rest of the country.\n\n\n\n\nSpeed\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJake Tapper\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in remarks in a CNN broadcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second presidential impeachment of Donald Trump was \u201cthe most bipartisan impeachment in American history.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n% of population with access\n\n\nRank (50 states)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 mbps\n\n\n94.4\n\n\n47\n\n\n\n\n6 mbps\n\n\n90.3\n\n\n46\n\n\n\n\n10 mbps\n\n\n88.0\n\n\n47\n\n\n\n\n25 mbps\n\n\n60.8\n\n\n43\n\n\n\n\n50 mbps\n\n\n58.4\n\n\n42\n\n\n\n\n100 mbps\n\n\n7.5\n\n\n44\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nKentucky is near the very bottom at every speed. How far behind is Kentucky at the highest speeds? The median state at 100 mbps, Missouri, still has 60 percent of its population in areas with access to Internet speeds at that level. Kentucky has just 7.5 percent.\nWhy such a discrepancy? Childers says it\u2019s about location. \"Some households are located in rural areas where traditional broadband is simply not provided \u2014 such as many sparsely populated areas in the mountains of Eastern Kentucky.\"\nThe state is working on it, though. Kentucky has received $5.3 million in grants, including from the 2009 federal economic stimulus, to help bring high-speed broadband Internet to all corners of the state.\nOur ruling\nOliver said, \"28 percent of Kentuckians don\u2019t have any online access.\"\nWhen it comes to Internet speak, \"access\" as a noun\u00a0refers to whether someone has the ability to acquire Internet. By that definition Oliver is wrong \u2014 as only less than 6 percent of Kentucky residents don\u2019t have access to Internet at what\u2019s considered a basic speed.\nWhat Oliver would have been better off saying is that 28 percent of Kentucky\u2019s residents don\u2019t access\u00a0(as a verb)\u00a0the Internet, which is supported\u00a0by Census Bureau data.\nThat said, Oliver is largely right in making his broader point \u2014 that\u00a0when\u00a0it comes to Internet access or use, Kentuckians tend to lag behind the rest of the country. The state ranks near the bottom in both percentage\u00a0of people who live on a broadband grid and the number of people with Internet in their homes.\nWhile this is sad news for the prospects of a PolitiFact Kentucky branch, it helps save Oliver\u2019s less-than-perfectly worded claim.
