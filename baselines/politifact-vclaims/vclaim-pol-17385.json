Veronica Escobar of El Paso said the president and his allies are \"the biggest threat to our safety and security\" because they are \"unwilling to take action for our country, acting solely in their own interest.\"\nShe went on to highlight the actions of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.\n\"Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Senate, is openly stonewalling legislation that would help improve the lives of veterans, women, and families \u2013 all of us,\" Escobar said, according to an English language translation of her remarks provided by her office. \"House Democrats have passed more than 275 bipartisan bills this Congress, but these bills are gathering dust on his desk.\"\u00a0\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who delivered the Democratic Party\u2019s response in English after the State of the Union, cited similar figures when discussing McConnell\u2019s actions: \"Those three bills, and more than 275 other bipartisan bills, are just gathering dust on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s desk.\"\nThe New York Times called Whitmer\u2019s claim \"exaggerated,\" based on an analysis from Factcheck.org of a statement from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u00a0making the same claim.\nEscobar\u2019s office shared a list of 291 \"bipartisan\" bills that were approved by the House since the beginning of 2019 but are awaiting action in the Senate, as of Jan. 24. Let\u2019s dive in.\nNo universal definition of \u2018bipartisan\u2019\nElizabeth Lopez-Sandoval, spokeswoman for Escobar, said Escobar considered bills as being bipartisan if there was \"at least one Republican vote on the House floor,\" or if the bill was passed by a voice vote and \"has at least one Republican cosponsor.\"\n\"Bills that passed on voice vote but do not have at least one Republican cosponsor were excluded,\" she said.\nWhile there is no singular definition of what constitutes a bipartisan bill, the four political experts we consulted for this piece generally agreed that Escobar used a low bar by which to judge cooperation between political parties.\nKirby Goidel, director of the Public Policy Research Institute at Texas A&M University, said the term \"bipartisan\" has taken on a looser definition in regular usage because it is \"advantageous in terms of public support.\"\n\"It is not unusual to call a bill bipartisan when it only received a single vote from across the aisle, though that runs against our more general understanding of what the term is intended to mean,\" he said in an email. \"It is also easy to imagine individual representatives more willing to compromise because they are Republican representing a Democratic district (or vice versa), so adding one member of the opposition in that context wouldn't strike anyone as \u2018bipartisan\u2019.\"\nAs an example, he added: \"(U.S. Sen. Mitt) Romney's vote didn't make the vote for impeachment bipartisan.\"\nGoidel said a better definition for bipartisan would be legislation that has \"majority support from both parties.\"\n\"Though ideally we wouldn't include resolutions or other items that generate little or no opposition, because the term also implies that the parties worked together to compromise on an important and potentially controversial issue,\" he said.\nFor the purposes of this fact-check, we\u2019ll rely on counting the votes, since it is tricky to gauge how much collaboration went into each proposal behind the scenes.\nJordan Tama, associate professor at American University who is writing a book about bipartisanship, said it is \"less common\" to see a truly bipartisan process in today\u2019s Congress, since members tend to develop legislation within their own party and only look to attract support from the other party after the fact.\n\"It is more common to see bipartisanship reflected in voting outcomes, even though in many of these cases the legislation wasn\u2019t developed in a very bipartisan method,\" Tama said. \"You can still call something bipartisan if the votes show support from both parties, even if it wasn\u2019t developed through a highly collaborative process.\"\nMembers of both parties tend to make claims about bipartisanship based on support from one member of the other party, according to Laura Blessing, senior fellow at Georgetown University\u2019s Government Affairs Institute.\n\"Everybody does this,\" she said. \"This is strategic messaging to a larger audience about the nature of legislation and values of main sponsors in reaching across the aisle, but that doesn\u2019t mean it is a meaningless standard.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There is a spectrum about how we think of measures of bipartisanship, and if these people want to use this, well, people have done this before and they\u2019ll do it again. It is a reasonable standard, but there are higher ones out there.\"\nAdding up the numbers\nWhen a bill comes before the full House, there are two primary ways the legislative body votes: a roll call vote or a voice vote.\nIn a roll call vote, the names of each legislator are read aloud and their vote is recorded alongside their name.\nWhen the body passes a measure in a voice vote, members call out \"aye\" or \"nay\" on the question of passage and the presiding officer decides which side prevailed. If there is a dispute over the decision, members stand to get an exact tally of the vote.\nOf the 291 bills Escobar\u2019s team marked as bipartisan, 116 passed in a roll call vote and 175 passed by a voice vote.\nBefore we get into the votes, here\u2019s a reminder about the party breakdown in the House. There are 232 Democrats, 197 Republicans and one independent. Five seats are vacant.\nLet\u2019s start with the 116 roll call votes: 71 passed with the support of a majority of Republican members of the House, ranging from 100 votes to 196 votes. Seven bills passed with anywhere from 55 to 93 GOP votes, and 38 passed with fewer than 50 Republican votes \u2014 23 of which passed with fewer than 10 Republican votes.\nEscobar\u2019s team flagged 175 bills that passed via a voice vote and have at least one Republican co-sponsor. Of those, 63 have Republican sponsors, meaning a Republican introduced the bill, and at least one Democrat as a co-sponsor.\nLooking at the 112 bills with a Democrat as the sponsor, five have more than 50 Republican co-sponsors and the rest have 32 or fewer Republican co-sponsors. Of those, 95 have fewer than 10 Republican co-sponsors.\nTama said he didn\u2019t think it was worth it to split hairs over sponsorships on bills that passed by a voice vote, since that generally indicates that there is support for the bill from both parties.\n\"You can really only use (a voice vote) when the vast majority of members are going to vote for it,\" he said. \"If you imagine a vote where two parties are polarized, you\u2019d have almost as many voting yes and no \u2014 you wouldn\u2019t be able to judge the outcome. I think it is safe to say that all of the voice votes involved bipartisan support, even if we can\u2019t know for sure what the result is.\"\nOverall, the experts we consulted agreed that, given the various definitions of bipartisan, Escobar\u2019s claim was largely accurate but could use more clarifying details.\nSean Theriault, a government professor at the University of Texas, said her use of the term bipartisan is fair.\n\"It\u2019s certainly not telling the whole truth, but a single vote from the other side does indicate that it enjoys support from both parties,\" he said in an email.\n\"So, of course, we would prefer Escobar to say, \u2018275 bills that have received at least support from one Republican are sitting on McConnell\u2019s desk,\u2019 but calling them \u2018bipartisan\u2019 is not wrong.\"\nOur ruling\nEscobar said: \"House Democrats have passed more than 275 bipartisan bills this Congress.\"\nEscobar counted bills as bipartisan if they had at least one Republican vote in favor or at least one Republican co-sponsor.\nPolitical experts said that her measurement is not inaccurate, but it doesn\u2019t conform to a general understanding of the term.\u00a0\nUsing the higher bar for measuring bipartisan legislation offered by these experts \u2014 support from a majority of members of both parties \u2014 plus counting legislation that passed on a voice vote, the total comes to 251 bills, which is close to Escobar\u2019s claim.\nOverall, her statement needs clarification. We rate it Mostly True.\nCorrection:\u00a0This article has been revised to correct the spelling of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's name.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17385"}
