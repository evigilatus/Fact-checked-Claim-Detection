Carlson said that Bolton was one of the most advanced people in Trump's administration and claimed he called Obama's loyalists on the National Security Council. \"There was no humanitarian problem John Bolton was not entirely convinced that could be solved by the brute power of government,\" said Carlson. \"That's a left assumption, not a right.\" He added, \"Don't let the mustache fool you.\" But it is Carlson's allegations about the former National Security Adviser that are ridiculous. (Fox News did not respond to requests for comments.) First, a note on ideologies: In the United States, we tend to link the terms \"left\" and \"right\" to the democratic and Republican parties, respectively. In this context, Carlson's claim is \"unbelievable,\" said William Leo Grand, Professor of Government at the American University, who previously served on the Senate Committee on Democratic Policy and the House of Representatives Democratic Assembly Task Force on Central America. \"It is clearly wrong to define it in terms of democratic versus republican politics,\" David Gartenstein Ross, Chief Executive Officer of Valins Global, a counter-terrorism consulting firm, and former adviser to the Office of Community Partnerships of the Ministry of Internal Security under the leadership of President Barack Obama and President Donald Trump. \"There is no doubt that, based on the American political context, he will be considered a man of the right,\" said Gartenstein Ross. This is because Bolton has spent his entire career in provincial districts and served in every presidential department of the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo returning to President Ronald Reagan, as Leo Grand said. Here are just a few examples of Bolton's work before joining the Trump administration: in high school, Bolton volunteered for an election campaign for Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater, who lost to President Lyndon Johnson in the 1964 general election. \u2022 Bolton spent the summer of 1972 between classes in law schools where Vice President Spiro Agnew was trained in the administration of President Richard Nixon. \u2022 Bolton joined the Reagan Administration of the Agency for International Development (USAID) in 1981 and served as General Adviser and Year in an administrative role. He then moved to the Reagan Ministry of Justice, where he was Assistant Attorney General for Legislative Affairs from 1985 to 1988 and Assistant Attorney General for one year in 1988. \u2022 In 1989, Bolton served as Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs for International Organization under the chairmanship of President George H.W. (Bosch) He held that post until 1993. \u2022 Bolton served as Ambassador to the United Nations in 2005 under the leadership of President George W. Bush, who appointed him to a \"temporary appointment\" after the Republican-led Senate did not confirm his candidacy. \u2022 He flirted with Bolton and ran for President in 2012 before Mr. Sin Met Romney supported him. \u2022 Bolton worked at the conservative American Enterprise Institute and contributed to the Weekly Standard, a conservative magazine, for several years. He was also a contributor to Fox News, where he received a salary of approximately $569,000 in 2017, each for the Washington Post. He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. :: By Bill McCarthy: January 12, 2021: in 2013, Bolton established an excellent election observation centre that contributed millions of dollars to the Republican Congress candidates in 2014, 2016 and 2018. \u2219 Foreign policy views known for their foreign policy views, Bolton criticized international institutions such as the United Nations and called for a more aggressive attitude towards hostile countries such as North Korea and Iran. He was an open critic of Obama, wrote opinion articles, a number of tweetings and a book on his policies. But Bolton's clamour - described by Carlson as a preference for \"the brute power of government\" - does not make him liberal, as Leo Grand said. \"In the field of foreign policy, the speciality of Bolton was conservative Republican interventionists.\" \"From Central America in the 1980s to the Middle East today, it was conservatives who believed that the United States could get its way out through \"a powerful force,\" he said: Here are some recent statements by Bolton on foreign policy: \"In a newspaper article in Wall Street Journal in 2018, Bolton argued in favour of pre-emptively beating North Korea: \"It is perfectly legitimate for the United States to respond to the current \"necessity\" of North Korea's nuclear weapons by beating first.\" \u2022 In The New York Times 2015, Bolton called for military action against Iran: \"Iran will not negotiate the abolition of its nuclear program. Nor will sanctions impede the building of a broad and deep weapons infrastructure. The disturbing fact is that only military action can achieve what is required. \u2022 In an interview in 2015 with a Washington examiner, Bolton said that he still believed that the invasion of Iraq was the right step: \"I still believe that the decision to overthrow Saddam was correct.\" \u2022 Bolton, in a newspaper article from Telegraph 2017, said that Russia's intervention in the American elections was \"a real act of war, and Washington will never tolerate.\" \u2022 In his 2018 speech at the Association's conservative conference, Bolton called for \"a massive military build-up\" and \"a comprehensive national debate on why preventing China from becoming the dominant global power\" should be a major concern for Americans. \u2022 In a 2018 speech, Bolton said that Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela represented a group of tyranny and announced new sanctions against Venezuela. Nor did we find any evidence to support Carlson's claim that Bolton \"invited Obama's loyalists within the National Security Council.\" (NCC did not respond to requests for comments). The Washington Post and Bolescu explained in detail the dilemma that occurred after Bolton assumed the post of National Security Adviser. Many officials had left office, while others had been transferred to new roles. Bolton left some exits vacant and others filled with people outside the government. For example, Bolton Mauricio Claver Carr\u00f3n, a political collector and member of lobby groups, was brought in to replace an official of the Central Intelligence Agency as Director of the Latin American National Security Council, according to the Washington Post. Similarly, Richard Goldberg, an adviser to the Foundation for the Defence of Democracies, has given a key position focusing on Iran. He had Charles Cooperman, a former executive director of the defence industry who once worked for Reagan, appointed deputy national security adviser. But none of them were Obama loyalists, as far as we know. On the contrary, Leo Grand said that Claver Caron \"declared Obama's openness to Cuba and has a long history of exerting pressure for strong foreign policy positions on the Cuban-American right.\" In addition, government bureaucracies such as the National Security Council are often full of permanent government officials who, as Gartenstein Ross said, remain in the form of staff from one department to another. He said, \"If someone served in Obama's administration, it doesn't mean he's an Obama loyalist,\" and he said, \"If anyone served in Obama's administration, it doesn't mean he's an Obama loyalist.\" \"It is very common for civil servants to serve across departments.\" Our judgment, Carlson, said that Bolton was a man from the left. He spent his entire career in Republican politics, and the experts said that his views always tended to the American right over the left. We didn't find any evidence that he'd upgraded his loyal Obama either. We're assessing this statement with pants on fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00162"}
