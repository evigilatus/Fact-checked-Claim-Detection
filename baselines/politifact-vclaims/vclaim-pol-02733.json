Eight people were killed and another 12 were injured.\nSaipov is believed to have been influenced by the terrorist group known as ISIS, or the Islamic State. Eyewitnesses said they saw Saipov shouting \"Allahu Akbar,\" a common Muslim phrase that affirms faith.\nHannity and Gorka, along with former Milwaukee County, Wis., sheriff David Clarke, were discussing Tapper\u2019s coverage the day of the attack.\n\"I\u2019m still trying to struggle with what kind of mind goes on live television as seven bodies are on the streets of Manhattan, and a child, and talks about the \u2018beautiful phrase\u2019 Allahu Akbar,\" Gorka said. \"Where does that motivation come from for Jake Tapper?\"\nBut that\u2019s not what Tapper said.\nDuring The Lead on Oct. 31, CNN crime and justice reporter Shimon Prokupecz told Tapper about witnesses hearing Saipov shout the phrase. \u00a0\n\"The Arabic chant Allahu Akbar, \u2018God is great,\u2019 sometimes said under the most beautiful of circumstances, and too often we hear it being said in moments like this,\" Tapper said as an explanation.\nTapper clearly is saying that \"Allahu Akbar\" is often said during joyous occasions, not implying that a terrorist\u2019s use of the phrase is somehow a good thing.\nFox News\u2019 Jason Chaffetz pointed out Tapper said \"how beautiful the phrase \u2018Allahu Akbar\u2019 can be,\" but later walked back his comments. Conservative website DailyCaller.com also criticized Tapper, then updated their story.\nThe CNN anchor refuted Fox News\u2019 coverage of his coverage on Twitter on Nov 1.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Greg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Fox News is lying. I said it can be said at beautiful moments (wedding, birth) and too often at times like this (horrific terrorist attack),\" he wrote in a thread about a tweet to the Chaffetz clip that Fox News later deleted. \"\u2018Allahu Akbar\u2019 is a prayer; if we don\u2019t understand how radical Islamic terrorists justify their evil using religion, West cannot defeat it.\"\nFox News is lying. I said it can be said at beautiful moments (wedding, birth) and too often at times like this (horrific terrorist attack). https://t.co/rQx3r0za6I\u2014 Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) November 1, 2017\n\nTapper responded to Gorka by tweeting, \"And, no surprise, @SebGorka lies as well, claiming i said Allahu Akbar was a \"beautiful phrase.\" Never said it, Sebastian. Blatant lie.\"\nAnd, no surprise, @SebGorka lies as well, claiming i said Allahu Akbar was a \"beautiful phrase.\" Never said it, Sebastian. Blatant lie. https://t.co/Q183XgwXOC\u2014 Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) November 2, 2017\n\nTapper had no further comment to add when we reached out to him. Gorka did not respond to our attempts to contact him.\nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations pointed us to a Nov. 1 opinion piece on CNN.com explaining the phrase. Imam Omar Suleiman, the founder and president of the Yaqeen Institute for Islamic Research, wrote that \"the words \u2018Allahu Akbar\u2019 simply mean \u2018God is greater.\u2019 It is a powerful declaration used by Muslims on many occasions and in many prayers. It is a celebration of life, the first words fathers whisper in the ears of their newborns.\"\n\"They are used to indicate gratitude when God bestows something upon you that you would have been incapable of attaining were it not for divine benevolence. It is a prayerful phrase that reminds us that, no matter what our concerns may be, God is greater than them.\"\nSuleiman also pointed out that U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., had said on Fox News in 2013 that while \"Allahu Akbar\" has been appropriated by radical Islamists as a battlecry, the words themselves aren\u2019t to be feared.\n\"McCain said the phrase is no more troubling than a Christian saying \u2018Thank God,\u2019 \" Suleiman noted.\nOur ruling\nGorka claimed Tapper said Allahu Akbar was a \"beautiful phrase.\"\nWhat Tapper actually said was that the phrase is used \"under the most beautiful of circumstances\" by Muslims, and not just by radicals committing terrorist acts. Gorka misquoted Tapper and ignored the larger context of his comment.\nWe rate this statement Pants on Fire!\n Share the Facts 2017-11-02 21:50:46 UTC   PolitiFact    1 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Pants on Fire  Says Jake Tapper said Allahu Akbar was a \"beautiful phrase\" after a terrorist attack in New York.
