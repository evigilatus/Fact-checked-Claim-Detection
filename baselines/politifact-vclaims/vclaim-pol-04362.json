She in turn noted that Donald Trump initially supported the war.\nWhen it was Trump\u2019s turn, the Republican nominee denied the charge.\n\"I was totally against the war in Iraq,\" Trump said during the NBC News event. \"You can look at Esquire magazine from '04. You can look at before that.\"\nWell, we have gone back further than the 2004 interview Trump mentioned, and the record tells a different story.\nTrump has a hard time getting past a September 2002 interview with shock jock Howard Stern. Stern asked Trump if he supported the looming invasion.\nTrump responded, \"Yeah, I guess so.\"\nTrump dialed that back a bit in another interview in January 2003, a few months before the invasion. Fox News\u2019 Neil Cavuto asked Trump whether President George W. Bush should be more focused on Iraq or the economy.\n\"Well, he has either got to do something or not do something, perhaps, because perhaps shouldn't be doing it yet and perhaps we should be waiting for the United Nations, you know,\" Trump said. \"He's under a lot of pressure. I think he's doing a very good job. But, of course, if you look at the polls, a lot of people are getting a little tired. I think the Iraqi situation is a problem. And I think the economy is a much bigger problem as far as the president is concerned.\"\nSo Trump put the economy ahead of confronting Iraq, but he didn\u2019t speak against going to war. At most he suggested waiting for the United Nations to do something.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA week after the United States invaded Iraq on March 19, 2003, Trump gave different takes. At an Academy Awards after-party, Trump said that \"the war\u2019s a mess,\" according to the Washington Post. He told Fox News that because of the war, \"The market\u2019s going to go up like a rocket.\"\nThe earliest evidence of Trump\u2019s outright opposition to the war came in that August 2004 article in Esquire:\n\"Look at the war in Iraq and the mess that we're in. I would never have handled it that way,\" Trump said.\nTrump has been challenged many times in this election to explain his early acceptance of the war. In a February 2016 interview on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, Trump said that he didn\u2019t know what he meant during his 2002 conversation with Stern.\n\"That was a long time ago, and who knows what was in my head.\" Trump said.\nOur ruling\nTrump said he was \"totally against the war in Iraq.\" While he came to that position when the war became difficult, earlier on he was more accepting of military action. In 2002, asked if America should go to war, he said, \"I guess so.\" Less than three months before the invasion, Trump said the president should be more focused on the economy, but he didn\u2019t speak against launching an attack.\nTrump didn\u2019t speak often about the Iraq War before it happened, but what he said did not add up to the sort of opposition he describes today.\nWe rate this claim False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/836f664c-ac07-4562-9333-ddef70b3bb65", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04362"}
