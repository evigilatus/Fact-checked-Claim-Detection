But the passage says \"I may not be Donald Trump now, but just you wait; if I don't make it, my children will,\" referring to Trump as an example of Americans\u2019 expectations that they will be financially secure in the future.\nSo, yes Obama did refer to Trump as a financially stable person, but he never said or wrote the words that are being attributed to him on social media.\nThe quote is inaccurate, exaggerated and taken out of context.
