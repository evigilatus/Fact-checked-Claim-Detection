In a new campaign ad, the liberal Greater Wisconsin Political Fund is aiming to make Walker pay for his earlier position.\n\nIn the ad, as an iPhone replica flashes onto the screen, a narrator asks: \"Don\u2019t you wish there was an app that told you when politicians were lying?\" Then a knockoff of PolitiFact\u2019s Truth-O-Meter fills the screen, as Walker is rated on three sound bites.\n\n(Sure, imitation is a form of flattery. But we\u2019re in real danger of being over-flattered this election.)\n\n\"I support BadgerCare,\" Walker says in one of the three. The needle jumps to False as the narrator snarls: \"Fact, Walker favors cutting up to 350,000 families and children off health care.\"\n\nWe\u2019ll look at the 350,000 charge, not Walker\u2019s pronouncement of support.\n\nThe Greater Wisconsin Committee made the same claim in an ad that started Sept. 2. The group is a political action committee that gets big money from organized labor, the Democratic Governors\u2019 Association and at least $1 million from outgoing Gov. Jim Doyle\u2019s soon-to-be defunct campaign fund.\n\nNeedless to say, the group is backing Democrat Tom Barrett as Doyle\u2019s replacement.\n\nSo, does Scott Walker support tossing hundreds of thousands of people off BadgerCare?\n\nThe answer would have been easier -- and the group\u2019s charge more accurate -- a few months ago.\n\nFirst, a little about BadgerCare. The program, targeted to the working poor and low-income unemployed, provides health insurance coverage to children, pregnant women, parents and childless adults. Its rolls have swelled dramatically -- to 767,910 in September 2010 -- due to eligibility expansions and the fallout of the recession. Walker voted for the program when he served in the state Assembly.\n\nAfter a late-August primary debate with Neumann, in which Walker reiterated his support for time limits, Walker backed off that position.\n\nWalker told the Journal Sentinel\u2019s Patrick Marley the next day that he had \"misspoke\" in saying he endorsed BadgerCare time limits -- he said he meant time limits on W-2, the state\u2019s welfare-to-work program. The Journal Sentinel reported that story on page 1 on Aug. 27, 2010.\n\nTo back up its claim that \"up to 350,000 families and children\" would lose coverage, the Greater Wisconsin Committee cites a lengthy Appleton Post-Crescent interview of Walker from June 2010 \u00a0-- and several other public statements. It also points to state BadgerCare data -- provided by the state to us for this item -- \u00a0showing more than 350,000 individuals now on BadgerCare have stayed longer than the 24 months Walker has discussed.\n\nThat\u2019s fine, but Walker\u2019s position on it clearly has changed -- even if the group\u2019s charge has not.\n\nSo, let\u2019s dig in again.\n\nPolitiFact Wisconsin listened to hours of Walker media interviews and concluded that over 11 months he unequivocally endorsed time limits in response to BadgerCare questions time and again. In the Appleton interview in June he suggested a 24-month limit.\n\nBut since the late August debate, Walker instead has emphasized possible tighter income rules and sounds open to dropping low-income childless adults from the program. That group was just added to the program in 2009; there are more than 50,000 enrolled.\n\nIn addition, Walker has made vague statements about getting back to the \"original intent\" of BadgerCare, which he defines as for the \"truly needy like the disabled, children from low-income families and low-income single parents.\" Walker says the state\u2019s exploding Medicaid population has put BadgerCare in a financial crisis.\n\nThe new, mushier position makes quantifying the true impact of Walker\u2019s position very difficult.\n\nThe Greater Wisconsin Committee says the language in its ad is still supported by the facts. Of course, with the \"up to\" qualifier, that leaves an awful lot of room.\n\nSome numbers:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you tighten up recent changes that made it easier to qualify, you would knock 68,000 people off the program, according to calculations by Jon Peacock, a researcher who studies state welfare issues at the liberal Wisconsin Council on Children and Families.\n\n\n\nIf you go back to pre-2008, before Doyle consolidated several programs into BadgerCare and made other changes, there were 267,000 fewer people on the program than today.\n\n\n\nThere are 400,000 people in working families on BadgerCare.\n\n\n\nWalker objects to BadgerCare insurance being a permanent entitlement.\n\nDoes that mean he objects to people continuing in the program once they get a job? His campaign declined to be specific beyond saying Walker thinks it ought to cover the truly needy like the disabled, children from low-income families and low-income single parents.\n\nThe numbers above include a lot of children. That may not be fair, given that Walker said in the Post-Crescent interview that he wants to \"make sure kids are covered.\" But it is unclear if Walker means all children currently eligible \u00a0or just those of unemployed parents.\n\nA lot of questions and few answers.\n\nPeacock said it best: \"I think it\u2019s very hard to quantify how much Walker might affect BadgerCare participation \u2013 partly because his statements have either been vague or fluid, and partly because it sounds like he might reduce eligibility below the level initially recommended by Governor Thompson.\"\n\nThe target may be moving, but the Truth-O-Meter has to stop somewhere.\n\nThe Greater Wisconsin Committee charges that Walker\u2019s original position could move as many as 350,000 people -- or fewer -- off BadgerCare. Their claim rested primarily on the time limits that Walker supported for almost a year but then backed away from just days before Greater Wisconsin\u2019s first ad in September.\n\nWalker changed course to a muddier position, while Greater Wisconsin has continued to cite the number. It adds an important qualifier though -- \"up to\" 350,000. Walker\u2019s new position, while unclear, still focuses on reining in BadgerCare enrollment -- whether it\u2019s the 68,000 or some other number remains to be seen.
