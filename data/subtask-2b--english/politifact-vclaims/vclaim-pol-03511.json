Can you help me out?\u2019 You know what they do? \u2018No problem, we'll amend your contract. How many jobs can you deliver?\u2019 Six. \u2018Fine. Now, the contract says you will deliver six jobs.\u2019 And then we go out and tout it community\u00a0to community as a success.\"\nCorcoran continued: \"That\u2019s a true story, Lockheed Martin.\"\nWe wondered if there is evidence that a Lockheed Martin contract was amended to reduce the number of new jobs that needed to be created from 305 to just six.\nCorcoran\u2019s story has some truth but oversimplifies what happened.\nWhat the state recommended at first\nLockheed Martin has multiple facilities throughout the state, including\u00a0in Orlando and Ocala, and is involved in more than one job incentive project on job deals, according to state data.\nCorcoran was referring to a $4 million incentive deal for a facility\u00a0in Oldsmar, located in northern Pinellas County.\nIn September 2012, the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity, an agency created in 2011 to oversee incentive programs, informed the Legislature about a proposed deal between Enterprise Florida and\u00a0Lockheed Martin to bring jobs to Pinellas County. (The DEO has to notify the Legislature when an incentive deal of this kind worth more than $2 million is being considered.)\nDEO provided the Legislature the first outline of the\u00a0deal for Lockheed Martin's Pinellas facility, which was signed by Gov. Rick Scott.\nPart of the\u00a0plan hinged on whether Lockheed Martin would win the bid for a contract to develop and build the\u00a0U.S. Navy\u2019s new Air and Missile Defense Radar, or AMDR.\nLockheed Martin officials had said its other facilities in the Northeast were also in competition with Oldsmar for the gig.\nThe outline said:\u00a0\"If Lockheed Martin wins the AMDR contract and chooses to complete the work in Pinellas County, the company will create 305 new and retain 554 full time jobs over the life of this project.\"\nBased on the document, Lockheed Martin and the DEO wanted to use the extra cash to renovate the Oldsmar facility and invest more in manufacturing equipment. This would make the facility more competitive with the other companies bidding for the defense contract.\n\"Anything that Lockheed Martin can do to help make the project more economically feasible helps to create a more competitive bid,\" reads the 2012 document.\nThe recommendation was for the state to award the company $4 million in one chunk once the facility held 726 jobs, showed a $14 million capital investment, and maintained an average wage of $59,000.\nCorcoran\u2019s team said the draft of the project was presented to the Legislature as a done deal.\nBut that\u2019s not how the DEO sees it.\n305 jobs taken out before final contract\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBill Nelson\n\n\nstated on June 11, 2009 in during a U.S. Senate debate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The truth is any oil that would be drilled could be sent to any other country in the world, reducing our use of foreign oil not by one single drop.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Aaron Sharockman \u2022 October 5, 2009\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDEO press secretary Morgan McCord said the agency informed the Legislature during the negotiation period that the recommended job metrics were being changed.\nThose revisions came about a month before the contract was signed and executed.\nMcCord sent over a copy\u00a0of an email sent to legislative leadership\u00a0and\u00a0budget staff\u00a0on April 16, 2013, that went over the changes.\nThat email shows DEO and Lockheed Martin agreed to revise a projected job creation and payment schedule.\nThe result was a new goal: the retention of 560 jobs \u2014 just six more than the earlier draft \u2014 for an average of 700 jobs by 2022.\u00a0\nWhy the change? DEO officials still believed Lockheed Martin was in the running for the defense contract, but the company would not need to ramp up its new jobs as high as originally thought. It would be hard to \"precisely estimate\" job levels every year over the term of the agreement, the contract said.\n\"As a result, the company has requested that it set a job target number (560) to be reached at a minimum each performance year to qualify for the closing fund award,\" reads the emailed explanation for the changes in payment conditions.\nHere's more detail:\n\nHere's what Corcoran was calling out:\u00a0the\u00a0new minimum target is 560 jobs a year instead of 554. That's six more jobs.\nLockheed Martin doesn\u2019t necessarily have to meet the 700-job average every year in order to get state dollars; it just needs to hit the 560-job minimum.\nThe DEO document said\u00a0the overall goal of the project \"remains the same: the retention and expansion of the company's manufacturing operations in the City of Oldsmar.\"\nScott approved the revisions. The contract was finalized on May 30, 2013.\nLockheed Martin didn\u2019t find out until late October 2013 that it wasn\u2019t awarded the AMDR contract. (It went to Raytheon.)\nAn amended contract was approved May 26, 2015\u00a0to reflect the fact that Lockheed Martin did\u00a0not win the defense contract.\nThis change did not alter job creation requirements, wage requirements, capital investment or return on investment under the final terms of the contract.\u00a0\nThose stipulate that in order to get the first seven $500,000 payments from the state between 2016 to 2022, Lockheed Martin must retain 560 jobs every year.\nIn order to get the final $500,000 payment, it has to have at least 700 jobs in\u00a0year eight and average at least 700 jobs in the previous seven years.\nDespite losing the missile defense bid, Lockheed Martin told the DEO that it was still committed to growing its Oldsmar facility and said it would stay committed to the key terms of the project that were agreed upon in 2013.\nLockheed Martin has not received any money yet for 2016. The DEO and a third-party auditor are\u00a0reviewing the company's\u00a0performance\u00a0for 2016. If the the company met \u00a0its performance requirements, it will receive the first $500,000 payment.\nOur ruling\nCorcoran said the state reworked an incentive contract with Lockheed Martin after the company asked to lower its job creation from 305 jobs to six.\nCorcoran is onto something, but there's additional information readers need to know.\nState officials recommended Lockheed Martin receive incentive dollars\u00a0as the company pursued a hefty missile defense contract from the federal government. If awarded, the state incentives contract said Lockheed Martin would create 305 new jobs in Pinellas County.\u00a0Before the state contract\u00a0was finalized, state officials agreed to amend the language about 305 jobs so that Lockheed Martin could receive $500,000 a year for seven years as long as it retained at least 560 jobs (six more jobs in addition to\u00a0554 already in place).\u00a0\nCorcoran left out that the jobs were contingent on a federal grant.
