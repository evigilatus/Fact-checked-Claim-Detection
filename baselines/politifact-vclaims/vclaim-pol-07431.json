Bob Donovan, a candidate for mayor in 2016, worries that upcoming retirements could further reduce what he sees as an undersized police force under Mayor Tom Barrett.\nIn his \u2018state of the city\u2019 speech Feb. 24, 2014, Barrett noted he had added 120 new officers in his 2014 budget. Donovan hit on that number when interviewed in the wake of his mayoral announcement.\n\"The reality is the number of officers has not increased,\" Donovan said during a July 29, 2014 appearance on the Charlie Sykes show on WTMJ-AM. \"Now the mayor will continue to say we\u2019re hiring 120 cops this year. That doesn\u2019t take into consideration the fact that we\u2019ve had 150 retirements, or that we haven\u2019t filled positions going way back.\"\nWhen we asked Donovan about the comment, he did not cite hard numbers, but told us he figures unfilled positions and retirements have outstripped the addition of recruits over the 10 years Barrett has been in office.\nIs Donovan \u00a0right?\nHas police strength -- at least by the numbers -- been flat or gone down on Barrett\u2019s watch?\nTo answer that question, we turned to the city\u2019s Fire and Police Commission, which issues an annual report that details the size of the overall force.\nTo be sure, the actual number of bodies on the force on any given date is constantly changing, since retirement dates vary while recruit classes mean a wave of new bodies joins the force at once.\nThe Fire and Police Commission reports, available online, are as close to an official tally of police strength as we found. They list, by race and gender, the number of persons on the Police Department payroll as of the last pay period of each year. The latest covers 2012, so we obtained figures for 2013 and so far in 2014 directly from the commission.\nWe used 2004 as the pre-Barrett baseline for our comparisons, because Barrett didn\u2019t take office until spring 2004 and therefore did not propose the budget for that year.\nAll figures factor in retirements, terminations and new hires.\nPolice officers\nAt the end of 2004, 1,402 police officers were on the payroll. That number fell to 1,357 by the end of 2013, a 3 percent drop.\nBy that measure -- the one the public sees -- Donovan is correct that officer strength \"has not increased.\"\nBarrett administration officials note it can be misleading to look only at strength of force at any one point in time. A new class of officer recruits came on line in late 2004, boosting the number, they said. A comparison of pay period one in 2004 to the same period in 2014, for example, actually shows a small increase in officer strength.\nA better measure than point in time comparisons, they said, is average strength across the whole year. That was 1,349 in 2004, they said, and based on the first half of 2014 it\u2019s 1,341 now -- a smaller decline.\nStill, that approach does not change the accuracy of Donovan\u2019s claim.\nTotal sworn officers\nCity officials often will refer to this larger figure when discussing \"officer strength,\" and Donovan did as well when we contacted him. It includes not only patrol officers but detectives, supervisors, various technicians and specialists as well as the police chief and the top command staff.\nAt the end of 2004, the figures show 2,006 sworn officers were on board. That number fell to 1,828 by late 2013 and to 1,875 by mid-July 2014.\nEarlier in 2004, according to Barrett\u2019s budget staff, the figure was 1,932. And Barrett\u2019s office released figures using the average strength throughout the year that show a smaller drop in overall sworn strength. Again, those figures change the angle of descent, but not the downward direction of the trend.\nWithin those numbers, the detective ranks fell by more than one fourth.\nSo by this broader measure, Donovan is on target again.\nTen-year trend\nThe staff strength figures from the Fire and Police Commission show that the police officer ranks grew early in Barrett\u2019s tenure, but have slipped gradually with one exception since then.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nYear\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Godlewski\n\n\nstated on January 9, 2021 in Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all women that lost jobs (in the December jobs report), it was mostly Black and Latina women.

That was accomplished by hiring more civilians to do those desk jobs, they said. Efficiencies have helped avoid layoffs seen in some big cities, Barrett spokeswoman Jodie Tabak said.\nThe Barrett officials told PolitiFact Wisconsin that our inquiry for this fact check led the mayor to quickly unveil a proposal to add 15 more officers to a training class that will graduate in April 2015. \u00a0It already had been under consideration to announce later this year, they said.\nThe mayor will propose his 2015 budget in September.\nOur rating\nDonovan said the number of Milwaukee police officers \"has not increased\" under Mayor Tom Barrett.\nDonovan\u2019s claim is on target because reports from the city\u2019s Fire and Police Commission indicate a decline in the number of officers since 2004. And other measuring sticks offered by Barrett\u2019s office show the same trend.\nWe rate Donovan\u2019s claim True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07431"}
