As of April 2, nearly 10 million people had filed for unemployment insurance.\u00a0\nBut getting fired for cause \u2014\u00a0as opposed to being laid off or furloughed \u2014\u00a0can jeopardize workers\u2019 ability to collect benefits. And a recent Facebook post suggests that Goodwill exploited shelter-in-place orders to fire its employees instead of merely laying them off.\n\"I just want to share what Goodwill Industries just did to all their employees,\" begins the April 2 Facebook post. \"They use this pandemic to fire all their employees instead of laying them off. They did say they would hire them all back as a brand new employee with no built up benefits or vacation time. I will not be donating or shopping there again. They definitely do not care about our community only how much money they can make off of us.\"\u00a0\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nLauren Lawson-Zilai, a spokesperson for Goodwill Industries International, told PolitiFact that each of the 157 Goodwill organizations in the United States and Canada is a locally operated nonprofit with its own president and CEO. More than 96% of Goodwill\u2019s thrift stores have closed because of state regulations in response to the spread of COVID-19, she said.\u00a0\nBut she said the Facebook post doesn\u2019t appear to be accurate.\u00a0\n\"Some Goodwill organizations have had to furlough their employees,\" she said. \"These employees are receiving benefits\" that vary state by state.\u00a0\nOther Goodwill operations are ongoing in some capacity, she said. For example, 90% of Goodwills are operating business services. Local Goodwill organizations contract with commercial and government organizations, among others, \"to provide a wide range of business services, including janitorial and grounds maintenance, flexible staffing, food service ... and laundry services.\"\nLawson-Zilai said many are also providing job preparation skills and they\u2019re offering online learning through Google Classroom. One Goodwill partnered with a local dry cleaner to dry clean previously donated clothes that physicians can use as smocks.\u00a0\nAt Goodwill stores in parts of Arizona, however, a majority of employees lost their jobs.\u00a0\nIn a statement, Goodwill of Northern and Central Arizona said that mandatory state stay-at-home orders led Goodwill there to \"make the very difficult decision to close our stores in order to protect the health and safety of our employees and shoppers.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMasks have negative impacts on 68% of children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jon Greenberg \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe statement says ensuring the organization\u2019s financial stability \"included the very difficult decision to part ways with the majority of employees at each store.\"\u00a0\n\"We are providing a severance package, which includes two-weeks pay, to help these team members in their transition to new employment,\" it says. \"We truly hope when this situation passes, we will be able to rehire the majority of these employees.\"\nLawson-Zilai said those employees were laid off because of economic constraints, not fired.\u00a0\nThe Facebook post, which was shared more than 19,000 times, drew hundreds of comments, too. Among them were comments from people who claimed to be Goodwill employees.\u00a0\n\"As an employee of a local Goodwill retail location, I can tell you this isn\u2019t true at my location,\" one commenter wrote. \"I\u2019m a full-time, hourly shift manager of five years who was given the choice of working or being furloughed; I chose furlough and I will keep my health insurance, my benefits and will retain my years of employment when I return, all while being eligible for full unemployment insurance benefits.\"\u00a0\n\"As a furloughed employee I can confirm that this is a completely untrue statement,\" another commenter said. \"Health insurance is being paid in full by the company for full time employees while furloughed and accrued (personal time off) isn\u2019t going anywhere.\"\u00a0\nYet another commenter wrote that she was \"\u2018let go\u2019 because of the virus.\"\n\"All I was told was that I\u2019m eligible for rehire when they allow managers to hire again,\" she said.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nThe Facebook post says that Goodwill fired all employees instead of laying them off.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s not accurate. Across the country, employees at local Goodwill organizations have been laid off or furloughed, but some operations have not shuttered, according to a Goodwill spokesperson.\u00a0\nIn parts of Arizona, a majority of employees were laid off. But they weren\u2019t fired as the Facebook post claims.\nWe rate this post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16889"}
