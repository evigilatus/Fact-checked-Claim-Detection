Two easy wins now in doubt because there is not enough time. Good job Jeff......\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 3, 2018 \nTrump did not identify the lawmakers by name. He didn\u2019t have to. In the past several weeks, the department has issued indictments against Republican Reps. Chris Collins of New York and Duncan Hunter of California.\nThe two men were among Trump\u2019s earliest supporters on Capitol Hill during the 2016 campaign.\nTrump\u2019s tweet has been criticized as an attack on both the rule of law, as well as the Justice Department\u2019s generally apolitical posture.\nHere, we\u2019re interested in whether the recent indictments stem from investigations that began under Obama, as Trump claimed. (We\u2019re not examining the popularity of the congressmen in question.) The Justice Department does not typically confirm the timeline of grand juries, and the department declined our request for comment on this story.\nOur research is limited to the indictments themselves, as well as public reporting. So far, the available evidence suggests one investigation began during Trump\u2019s presidency. The timing of other is less clear.\nChris Collins investigation\nAll public evidence suggests Collins\u2019 investigation began under Trump, not Obama. What\u2019s more, the charges he faces stem from a phone call made in June 2017, months after Trump took office and his pick to lead the Justice Department, Sessions, was confirmed.\nCollins is accused of insider trading. The charges stem from a phone call he made to his son Cameron to relay closely-held details about an Australian biotech company. Both men held stock in the firm.\nAs a board member of the company, Innate Immunotherapeutic, Chris Collins learned \u2014 before it was publicly known \u2014 that the company had failed a pivotal drug trial.\nHad the drug passed the test, it would have offered a lucrative treatment for a certain form of multiple sclerosis. Instead, the public announcement of the negative results caused the stock price to plummet by 92 percent.\nBut before the results became public, Collins called his son, a shareholder, so that he could dump the stock, the indictment says. Timely trades by the father and son, along with a third defendant, allowed them to avoid losses totaling more than $768,000.\nThat phone call took place in June 2017 \u2014 months after Trump succeeded Obama.\nThe defendants were indicted Aug. 8 in the Southern District of New York. All three pleaded not guilty.\nPreet Bharara, who served as the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York from 2009 to 2017, until he was fired by Trump, would almost certainly know if the Collins investigation started under the previous administration.\n\"Chris Collins was not an Obama era investigation,\" Bharara tweeted in response to Trump.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChris Collins was not an Obama era investigation. FYI. https://t.co/IQqdpTvS60\u2014 Preet Bharara (@PreetBharara) September 4, 2018 \nDuncan Hunter investigation\nThe start date of Hunter\u2019s investigation is a bit trickier.\nHunter and his wife have been charged with misusing $250,000 in campaign funds to finance personal expenses like family trips.\nThe couple also is alleged to have filed false campaign finance records.\nHunter\u2019s behavior generated some attention prior to Trump taking the White House.\nThe Office of Congressional Ethics, a government watchdog established by the U.S. House of Representatives, asked the House Committee on Ethics to look into allegations about Hunter in August 2016. Some of the misconduct he\u2019s since been indicted for also predates the 2016 election.\nThat said, the first news reports that Hunter was under criminal investigation appear to have surfaced in March 2017, during Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\"The Hunter one has probably been pending longer (than the Collins investigation),\" said Lisa Kern Griffin, a law professor at Duke University. \"Though it\u2019s hard to say whether DOJ \u2018opened\u2019 it before or after the election or transition.\"\nHunter\u2019s charges indicate they were issued by a \"September 2016 Grand Jury.\"\nSo is that when the grand jury began investigating Hunter\u2019s case?\nNot necessarily, say legal experts.\n\"A grand jury usually will work on a lot of matters, and even if this grand jury started in September 2016, it might have been working on other things until the last several months,\" said Andrew Leipold, a law professor at University of Illinois College of Law.\nIn other words, it\u2019s possible the grand jury began working on Hunter\u2019s case after the election.\n\"You just can\u2019t tell from the indictment,\" Leipold said.\nOur ruling\nTrump said the investigations of two Republican congressmen began under Obama.\nThe jumping-off point for the Collins insider-trading investigation was a phone call that began months after Obama left office.\nThe start date of Hunter\u2019s investigation is a bit trickier. A congressional watchdog looked into campaign finance allegations prior to Trump\u2019s presidency, and some of the misconduct he\u2019s since been indicted for also predates the 2016 presidential election.\nBut the first public reports that Hunter was under criminal investigation appear to have surfaced in March 2017, during Trump\u2019s presidency.\nWe rate this Mostly False.\n Share the Facts 2018-09-04 21:56:28 UTC   PolitiFact    3 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly False  \"Two long running, Obama era, investigations of two very popular Republican Congressmen were brought to a well publicized charge, just ahead of the Mid-Terms, by the Jeff Sessions Justice Department.\"    Donald Trump President https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1036681588573130752   in a tweet Monday, September 3, 2018 2018-09-03    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01667"}
