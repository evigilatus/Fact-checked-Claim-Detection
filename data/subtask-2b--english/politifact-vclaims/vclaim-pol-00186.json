For individual filers, the act\u00a0increased the standard deduction\u00a0and child credit\u00a0while eliminating personal exemptions, among other changes, such as capping the state and local tax deduction at $10,000.\nIt is true that median worker pay has increased and the unemployment rate is down. But Reed intimated the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is responsible for the economic gains. We asked Reed\u2019s office about the link.\u00a0Reed's\u00a0spokesman did not refute that he made such a connection, nor\u00a0did he provide evidence establishing a link between them.\u00a0\u00a0We wondered if the federal tax law is responsible, as Reed implied, for\u00a0American workers\u2019 pay increasing and the lower unemployment.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe gains\nThe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported\u00a0that as of July 2019, median worker pay increased by 3.7 percent over the last year. When inflation is accounted for, wage growth was 2 percent during the same period.\nReed\u2019s spokesman, Will Reinert, pointed us to that data, and economists we spoke with described it as the most reliable data on the topic.\u00a0\nSeveral economists said Reed\u2019s claim about wage growth is true, though to get a true picture of how well wages are staying ahead of inflation, inflation must be part of the calculation. However, just because inflation isn\u2019t factored in doesn\u2019t make Reed\u2019s claim false, said Benjamin Page, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank.\u00a0\nAs for unemployment, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on Aug. 2 that as of July 2019, the unemployment rate was 3.7 percent.\u00a0Historical data from the labor statistics bureau shows that the unemployment rate has generally fallen since a high of 10 percent in October 2009. Looking back to 1948, the unemployment rate has been lower than the current rate of 3.7 percent in the late\u00a01960s but also in the 1950s\u00a0and in 1948.\nTax law effect\nReed tweeted: \"Our economy is booming after tax cuts.\"\nBut is it booming because of tax cuts?\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn May, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service said the effects were\u00a0minimal.\n\"On the whole, the growth effects tend to show a relatively small (if any) first-year effect on the economy,\" analysts wrote.\u00a0\"Although examining the growth rates cannot indicate the effects of the tax cut on GDP, it does tend to rule out very large effects in the near term.\" On wages, analysts found that \"ordinary workers had very little growth in wage rates.\"\nWe also interviewed four economists about Reed\u2019s claims.\u00a0\nPage, of the Tax Policy Center, said the tax law had some effect, though the unemployment rate and wage growth are consistent with historical trends. Since 2015, two years before the law was passed, median weekly earnings have been growing, on average, at 3 percent, he said.\n\"It\u2019s not something that all of the sudden happened,\" he said. \u00a0\u00a0\nLeonard Burman, a professor at Syracuse University and a former deputy assistant secretary for tax analysis\u00a0in the Treasury Department, said that the tax law and spending increases signed by Trump boosted the economy primarily by increasing households\u2019 disposable income, but that economists \"cannot precisely measure the current effects of the tax cut as compared with many other important factors.\"\u00a0\n\"The main explanation for the statistics that Congressman Reed cites is that we are at the peak of the business cycle,\" Burman said.\u00a0\nNeel Rao, an associate professor in the Department of Economics at the University at Buffalo, said Reed\u2019s claims have \"some basis in fact,\" but that \"it\u2019s not the whole story.\"\u00a0Rao said there is no solid evidence linking what is happening in the labor market to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. As the Bureau of Labor Statistics data show, unemployment has been on a downward trend before the tax reform package went into effect.\u00a0\u00a0\nAparna Mathur, a resident scholar in economic policy at the free-market American Enterprise Institute, agreed that wages are rising nominally by 3 percent per year\u00a0and that unemployment is at historic lows, but that there isn\u2019t enough evidence that the tax reform package had anything to do with it.\u00a0\n\"If you look at the trend in average wages and employment before and after December 2017, there is nothing to suggest that the (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) has had an impact on that trend,\" Mathur said. Both unemployment and wages were \"trending smoothly\" well before the tax legislation was passed, she said.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nAfter tax cuts, Reed said, unemployment is at a record low\u00a0and that average worker pay is rising by more than 3 percent.\u00a0\nThat's not in dispute, with the caveat that unemployment was lower in the 1940s, 50s and 60s. But he implies it is because of the tax cuts, and that's not the case, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service and the economists we talked to. The economic indicators were trending that way before the law was passed in 2017.\u00a0\nHis statement is partially accurate. There have been economic gains. But he takes things out of context when he neglects to mention economists and a nonpartisan congressional research report indicate the tax cuts didn't have much to do with it.\nWe rate Reed\u2019s claim Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00186"}
