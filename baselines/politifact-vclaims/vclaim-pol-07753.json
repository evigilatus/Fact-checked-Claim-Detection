But we were especially interested in one claim she made: \"President Obama would eventually declassify many of the details of the program and explain his policies to the world, but in 2009 all I could say was \u2018no comment\u2019 whenever the subject came up. Yet it was widely known that dozens of senior terrorists had been taken off the battlefield by drones, and we later learned that bin Laden himself worried about the heavy losses that drones were inflicting.\"\nIs that correct?\nFirst, some background. Using armed unmanned aerial vehicles in combat is controversial because it pushes legal boundaries. (Here\u2019s a previous fact-check in which we looked at this issue.) Of special concern is that drones have killed at least four American citizens on foreign soil.\nIn defense of the program, officials often praise its effectiveness in hampering terrorist organizations.\nTallying up the number of drone strikes is challenging, for obvious reasons -- they are done with tight secrecy. Although breaking down this data is difficult to do as a layperson, experts we checked with suggest that the claim that U.S. drone strikes have killed \"dozens\" of senior terrorists may well be an understatement.\n\"Hillary Clinton\u2019s statement is 100 percent correct,\" said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. \"That\u2019s a conservative estimate.\"\nThere are no definitive lists of drone strikes or casualties they cause, but an analysis by the New America Foundation, a think tank, found that as of 2013, drones have killed about 58 known militant leaders in Pakistan and 35 in Yemen. In just those two countries, drones have killed between 2,861 and 4,452 people in all -- civilians and unknowns, in addition to militants, according to the foundation\u2019s study. (Pakistan and Yemen are the locations of the majority of United States drone strikes, though attacks have also occurred in Libya, Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and Philippines.)\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClinton, though, uses the \"dozens\" number to refer to senior terrorists killed through 2009. A look through another non-governmental database -- created by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, a philanthropically funded investigative-journalism project based in the United Kingdom -- appears to provide support for Clinton\u2019s claims.\nWe sifted through the project\u2019s aggregated news reports about confirmed and suspected U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia, where the U.S. primarily sends drones to target members of al-Qaida and its affiliates. We searched for reported deaths of terrorists and militants described as \"senior,\" \"leader\" or \"commander\" through the end of 2009.\nUnder these reasonably restrictive conditions, we found roughly three dozen top terrorists killed. Looking just at articles compiled by the\u00a0Washington Post, we come up with at least two dozen.\nThis number is nowhere near definitive, since it includes several deaths that are disputed. On the other hand, the number could be higher since it doesn\u2019t include information from unreported strikes or strikes in Afghanistan, Libya, Iraq or Philippines.\nDespite these caveats, a conservative analysis of the evidence does suggest a factual basis for Clinton\u2019s claim.\nA final note: Clinton also appears to be right about bin Laden being concerned about drones.\nA trove of letters found at Osama bin Laden\u2019s compound after his 2011 death reveal that he was concerned about America\u2019s drone use. In an October 2010 letter, he revealed that he was particularly worried about attacks in Waziristan, a region of Afghanistan.\n\"I am leaning toward getting most of the brothers out of the area,\" he wrote. \"We could leave the cars because they are targeting cars now, but if we leave them, they will start focusing on houses and that would increase casualties among women and children. It is possible that they have photographed targeted homes. The brothers who can keep a low profile and take the necessary precautions should stay, but move to new houses on a cloudy day.\"\nOur ruling\nClinton said that \"dozens of senior terrorists had been taken off the battlefield\" by drones. While it\u2019s difficult to find a definitive number just using publicly available evidence, even a conservative estimate using credible accounts is enough to rate her claim True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07753"}
