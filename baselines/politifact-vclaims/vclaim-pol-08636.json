He supports charter schools. He\u2019s hard on teachers, and his quest for tenure and other reforms is over the top.\nBut the governor continues responding to those complaints with various versions of this refrain: New Jersey has the most funding put toward education in state history.\nAnd Christie said it again Nov. 2 during a gubernatorial campaign stop in Somers Point, when he and a public school teacher got into an argument. Christie was re-elected Tuesday.\n\"In fact, there\u2019s more state funding for education today than any other time,\" Christie said when the teacher cited the governor\u2019s education funding cuts for why he has referred to New Jersey schools as \"failure factories.\"\nTechnically Christie is right about the level of education funding in New Jersey, but as we\u2019ve pointed out in the past, there\u2019s a bit more to this story that he doesn\u2019t address.\nFirst, let\u2019s get back to that remark about \u2018failure factories.\u2019 Christie used it during a speech he gave Oct. 6 to the Orthodox Union in Teaneck, where he promoted his education policies.\n\"I would be happy to take as many dollars as possible away from failure factories that send children on a no-stop route to prison and to failed dreams, if we could take that money and put it into a place where those families have hope,\" Christie said.\nNow, to the governor\u2019s point about education funding.\nChristie\u2019s proposed fiscal year 2014 budget called for nearly $9 billion in education funding, about $1 billion more than the previous year. Under that spending plan, state aid to schools increased $97 million. While no district saw a state aid decrease, many either received an increase of $1 or their funding stayed the same as the previous year.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the time, Christie released a statement through the state Department of Education in which he touted the funding level while also emphasizing fiscal restraint.\n\"However, even as we continue to fund education at the highest levels in state history, we must remain willing to reflect on how we are spending our money and work towards solutions that make every dollar we invest count,\" he said in the statement.\nWe\u2019ve previously run Christie\u2019s claim past Steve Wollmer, a spokesman for the New Jersey Education Association, the state\u2019s largest teacher\u2019s union. Wollmer agreed that in terms of dollars, it\u2019s correct that the state has its highest-ever level of education funding.\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean there hasn't a been long-lasting downside to cuts that Christie made during his first year as governor. He took office in January 2010.\n\"But what he doesn\u2019t mention is that he cut $1.3 billion from state aid in his first year \u2013 Withholding $475 million in aid in January, which was the amount that the state\u2019s nearly 600 districts had in total surpluses for unanticipated expenses (a new roof, a bus that needed replacing, an unanticipated special ed placement), and another $820 million in the FY11 budget (which began for schools in September of 2010),\" Wollmer said previously in a statement to PolitiFact New Jersey. \"Districts cut back dramatically, and 10,000 teachers and staff were laid off, programs were cut, and class sizes increased.\"\nThose cuts continue to sting, Wollmer said.\nIn addition to the cuts, the New Jersey Supreme Court in 2011 ordered Christie to increase aid to the now-former Abbott districts by about $500 million.\nOur ruling\nChristie last week said during an argument with a teacher, \"In fact, there\u2019s more state funding for education today than any other time.\"\nCritics frequently call the governor out for the massive funding cuts he\u2019s made to education since taking office, and for either increasing state aid by a minimal amount or not at all. But the fact of the matter is that despite the cuts, New Jersey\u2019s education funding level is the highest it\u2019s ever been. For that reason, we rate Christie\u2019s statement True.\nTo comment on this story, go to NJ.com.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08636"}
