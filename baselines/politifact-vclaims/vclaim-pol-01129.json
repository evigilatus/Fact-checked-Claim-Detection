He was secretary of state, national security adviser and he served under two presidents. He also thinks \"Donald Trump is a phenomenon that foreign countries haven\u2019t seen before,\" according to a Facebook post from Sept. 16.\n\"The former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger gives us a new understanding of President Donald Trump\u2019s foreign policy and predicts its success,\" the post goes on before supposedly quoting Kissinger again: \"Liberals and all those who favor (Hillary) Clinton will never admit it. They will never admit that he is the one true leader. The man is doing changes like never before and does all of it for the sake of this nation\u2019s people. After eight years of tyranny, we finally see a difference.\"\nThe post attributes more statements to Kissinger, including: \"Trump puts America and its people first. This is why people love him and this is why he will remain in charge for so long. There is not a single thing wrong with him and people need to open their eyes.\"\n\"Trump is the one true leader in world affairs and he is forcing policy changes that put America first!\" it later says.\nThis post, which has been shared more than 81,000 times, was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

One, their perception that the previous president or outgoing president basically withdrew America from international politics, so that they had to make their own assessment of their necessities, and secondly, that here is a new president who is asking a lot of unfamiliar questions. And because of the combination of the partial vacuum and the new questions, one could imagine that something remarkable and new emerges out of it. I\u2019m not saying it will. I\u2019m saying it\u2019s an extraordinary opportunity.\"\nKissinger did not call Trump the one true leader, or describe the Obama presidency as \"eight years of tyranny.\" And while he spoke positively about the new president, he didn\u2019t claim that \"there is not a single thing wrong with him and people need to open their eyes.\"\nWe rate this post False.\nCorrection, Jan. 17: The date of Henry Kissinger's Face the Nation interview was Dec. 18, 2016.\n\u00a0\n Share the Facts 2019-01-16 20:09:22 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  Says Henry Kissinger said \"Trump is the one true leader in world affairs and he is forcing policy changes that put America first!\"     Bloggers On the Internet    in a post on Facebook Sunday, September 16, 2018 2018-09-16    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01129"}
