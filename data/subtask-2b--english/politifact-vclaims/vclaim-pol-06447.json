Marco Rubio, R-Fla., argues that the United States needs to do more to beef up its military to face down evil.\nSpeaking at the Iowa Faith and Freedom summit on April 25, Rubio said that threats worldwide \"require strong American leadership, which we cannot exert as long as we eviscerate military spending, which is what we are doing now. We are placing our nation at a dangerous position.\"\nThen he said this about the country\u2019s nuclear stockpiles: \"We are the only nation that is not modernizing its nuclear weapons.\"\nWe wanted to know whether Rubio was correct that the United States isn\u2019t modernizing its nuclear weapons, so we consulted with experts on U.S. nuclear policy. (We reached out to Rubio\u2019s presidential campaign and Senate office and did not get a response.)\nModernizing nuclear weapons\nMultiple experts told us that Rubio\u2019s claim about nuclear weapons is wrong because ongoing and planned nuclear modernization efforts are extensive. The United States has been spending billions modernizing nuclear equipment -- and has plans to continue to do so.\nThe National Nuclear Security Administration\u2019s March 2015 report to Congress details plans to modernize nuclear equipment including various warheads over the coming years. A Congressional Research Service Report issued the same month covered similar topics.\nModernization is \u00a0happening for many different types of nuclear programs, said Matthew Bunn, an expert on nuclear proliferation and a professor Harvard University. (During the 1990s, Bunn was adviser to the White House\u2019s Office of Science and Technology Policy.)\n\"First, while we haven\u2019t deployed major new strategic systems in some time, we\u2019ve been modernizing the ones we\u2019ve got more or less continuously \u2014 new rocket motors and guidance systems for the Minuteman missiles, lots of rebuilt parts for the B-52s, etc., etc. We\u2019re in the middle of a $10 billion modernization of the B-61 bomb,\" Bunn said.\nThese modernization plans are not cheap. The Congressional Budget Office estimated in January that the administration\u2019s plans for nuclear forces would cost $348 billion over the next decade. During the next three decades, the cost to maintain the nuclear arsenal and purchase replacement systems could rise to more than $1 trillion, according to a 2014 report by the The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMike Fasano\n\n\nstated on October 11, 2011 in a news article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Just a little over 60 percent of your electric bill, my electric bill, 60 percent of that is pass-throughs, whether they be for building of nuclear plants or whatever they may be.\" A planned nuclear plant repair \"will only increase that percentage.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Becky Bowers \u2022 October 18, 2011\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe size of the U.S. stockpile has been declining since the 1960s and will decline further under the new START Treaty agreed to with Russia in 2011. But nuclear weapons can \"live\" for a long time. Several nuclear weapons introduced or upgraded in the 1990s or 2000s can be used for another 20 to 30 years, said Hans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists. (Kristensen pointed to several upgrades in recent decades.)\nOne analyst we spoke with had concerns that the upgrades aren\u2019t happening fast enough. Tom Donnelly, a defense policy analyst at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, told PolitiFact that \"we are not really modernizing our nukes very seriously\" and that some projects are years -- even decades -- away and could could fall prey to budget cuts. \u00a0\nBut Benjamin Friedman, an expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, said that even if some modernization plans were canceled, \"we would still be modernizing our nuclear arsenal or our nuclear weapons, just less of them. So any normal definition of \u2018modernize,\u2019 describes what the United States is doing with its nuclear weapons.\"\nRubio compared the United States to the rest of the world without naming any other countries when he said \"we are the only nation that is not modernizing its nuclear weapons.\"\nRubio said that the United States was \"the only nation\" not modernizing its weapons, but Bunn, the Harvard professor, said comparing the United States on that basis with other countries is misleading. China, for example, is modernizing its arsenal, but its arsenal is also far smaller. The United States and Russia have over 90 percent of the world\u2019s nuclear weapons, he said.\n\"So I would say: (a) not true that we haven\u2019t been modernizing at all; (b) IS (mostly) true that we haven\u2019t bought any big new strategic delivery systems lately; (c) highly misleading not to mention that all nuclear powers other than ourselves and Russia have tiny nuclear arsenals compared to ours,\" Bunn said.\nOur ruling\nRubio said that the United States \"is not modernizing its nuclear weapons.\"\nMost of the experts we interviewed disputed Rubio\u2019s statement. While the United States has reduced the number of warheads, it has also been modernizing nuclear equipment and has plans to continue to do so.\nWe rate this claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06447"}
