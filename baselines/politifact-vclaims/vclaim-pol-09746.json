According to the Florida Department of State, a \"person\" in campaign finance terms is defined broadly to include \"an individual or a corporation, association, firm, partnership, joint venture, joint stock company, club, organization, estate, trust, business trust, syndicate or other combination of individuals having collective capacity.\"\n\nSo each \"person\" can contribute $500 for a primary and $500 for a general election, or $1,000 total. The same person can also contribute another $1,000 for a business they own. Or if they own 10 businesses, they can contribute an additional $10,000. And so on.\n\nWeatherford spokesman Ryan Duffy directed us to a breakdown of campaign limits\u00a0across states by the National Conference of State Legislatures. Duffy said Florida is actually tied for the second-lowest limit, with Maine being the state with the lowest limit ($350).\n\nBut it\u2019s not a simple apples-to-apples comparison.\n\nFlorida\u2019s $500 limit -- or $1,000 if you include the primary and general election -- is the same for all state races (House, Senate, Cabinet and governor), but limits in other states vary according to the race. In Connecticut, for instance, individual donations max out at $3,500 per election for gubernatorial candidates (more than Florida), $1,000 for state Senate races (the same) and $250 for state House races (and less).\n\nSome states have different contribution limits for election years and non-election years. And instead of counting donations for each election, like Florida, some states strictly look at donation tallies per calendar year.\n\nPoint being, it\u2019s pretty complicated. So we went to the experts.\n\nNCSL senior fellow Jennie Bowser provided us a list of 12 states that have the same or lower contribution limits as Florida in certain situations. (Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana and Wisconsin).\n\nA few examples, from the NCSL:\n\n* Candidates for Legislature in Delaware can receive a total of $600 in contributions (counting the primary and general election).\n* Candidates for Legislature in Montana can receive a total of $320 in contributions (counting the primary and general election).\n* Candidates for Legislature in Colorado can receive a total of $400 in contributions (counting the primary and general election).\n\nIn each case, that compares to $1,000 in Florida.\n\nWeatherford\u2019s point would be closer to accurate if he were talking solely about contributions to a candidate for governor, Bowser said. Alaska\u2019s limit is the same as Florida\u2019s as long as the total amount is given in two separate contributions, each in a different calendar year. Arizona\u2019s $872 limit is the lowest.\n\nOur ruling\nWeatherford claimed Florida\u2019s direct campaign contribution limit is the second-lowest limit in the country.\n\nFlorida\u2019s limit ($500 per election) is low compared to some states, though it\u2019s not that low when you consider that people can make multiple contributions using business entities. But even still, Weatherford errs in trying to make a sweeping comparison because states don\u2019t have an across-the-board limit. We rate his claim False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden canceled the Keystone pipeline because Warren Buffett \u201cdonated $58 million\u201d to his campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 29, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09746"}
