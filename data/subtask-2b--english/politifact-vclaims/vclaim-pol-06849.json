Rick Perry declared himself a union member during a \"policy orientation\" held in Austin before the 2015 Texas legislative session.\nPerry, appearing with former House Speaker Newt Gingrich at the Jan. 9, 2015, gathering hosted by the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation, eased toward his declaration by saying the Teamsters union had supported him for governor.\nReaching out to it would work, he said, \"not because I\u2019m a dyed-in-the-wool AFL-CIO member -- which I am.\" Perry then addressed a mentor in the audience, former Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, saying: \"You didn\u2019t know that, did you?\" Amid laughter, Perry went on: \"Not only did I used to be a Democrat, senator, I belong to the AFL-CIO. Got the card in my pocket,\" Perry said, acting as if to reach for it, \"and they probably hate it that I pay my dues every quarter.\"\nEd Sills, spokesman for the Texas AFL-CIO, commented on Perry\u2019s declaration in the union\u2019s email news distributed later the same day, writing: \"If any reader of this newsletter wants to own up to Perry's membership in their union, please send word.\n\"But I kid,\" Sills wrote. \"The more, the merrier. The labor movement wants to be a big tent and we do proudly represent a minority of Republican members, many of them of the rock-ribbed, partisan variety. The AFL-CIO does not have a loyalty test.\"\nLike Sills, we wondered if Perry, who entered politics as a Democratic Texas House member before switching parties and winning his first statewide race (for agriculture commissioner) in 1990, is a union member.\nTo our inquiry, gubernatorial spokesman Felix Browne pointed out by email the Dallas Morning News described Perry\u2019s membership in a Feb. 22, 2010, news story. That story said: \"The governor became a member of the Screen Actors Guild after he appeared in the Tommy Lee Jones movie Man of the House. In the movie, he played the governor of Texas.\" The day after Perry mentioned the membership, Breitbart.com, the conservative news site, quoted a former Perry aide, Kris Heckmann, saying Perry continued to pay his union dues after the making of the 2005 movie.\nAt our request, Browne provided a photo of Perry\u2019s membership card for the SAG-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, which we edited for this photo solely to remove his membership number:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 23, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBiden invested the entire family fortune in Ukraine gas and oil.

A SAG-AFTRA spokeswoman, Pamela Greenwalt, told us by phone the union does not reveal whether anyone is a member.\nFootnote: Sills said in his item on Perry\u2019s announcement that as governor, Perry had not been a backer of Texas AFL-CIO policies. \"He has opposed a minimum-wage increase, has rejected on ideological grounds tens of billions of dollars in federal funds that would expand Medicaid coverage, has chipped away at the ability of laid-off workers to receive Unemployment Insurance benefits, and has presided over a public school system that a state judge found to be unconstitutionally inadequate,\" Sills wrote.\nOur ruling\nPerry said he\u2019s a member of the AFL-CIO.\nSince 2006, Perry has been a member of the Screen Actors Guild, which is part of the AFL-CIO. We rate his claim True.\n\nTRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate and there\u2019s nothing significant missing.\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06849"}
