Rather, it says Ukrainian members of parliament held a press conference at Interfax-Ukraine to demand Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky and Trump investigate what they called suspected money laundering involving Burisma founder Minister Mykola Zlochevsky and former President Viktor Yanukovych.\nAccording to the story, one of the members of parliament, Andriy Derkach, said that the money transferred to \"representatives of the Burisma Group, including Hunter Biden,\" amounted to $16.5 million.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBurisma is central to the U.S. House impeachment inquiry. Trump is accused of holding up U.S. aid to Ukraine on the condition that Zelensky announce an investigation into Burisma and Hunter Biden, son of former Vice President Joe Biden, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020. Hunter Biden was on Burisma\u2019s board of directors until this year. His involvement has led to scrutiny from Republicans and inspired conspiracy theories.\u00a0\nBut as NBC News reported, there was no announcement of an indictment Wednesday, as the Facebook posts claim. And according to the Daily Beast, Ukraine\u2019s chief prosecutor, Ruslan Ryaboshapka, said there is no investigation into the Bidens by his office.\nHere\u2019s what did happen: In October, Ryaboshapka, announced his office would conduct a wide-ranging review of all previous cases involving Burisma, according to NBC. And on Nov. 20, Reuters reported that Ryaboshapka said the country would widen its investigation into Burisma founder Zlochevsky to include suspicion of embezzling state funds.\u00a0\nReuters reported that the prosecutor\u2019s announcement followed the press conference that Interfax-Ukraine wrote about, in which members of parliament called for an investigation into Burisma-related money laundering. There, a document from the general prosecutor\u2019s office was leaked, Reuters said, showing that another prosecutor suspected Zlochevsky, the Burisma founder, of using his official position to embezzle $33 million from the country\u2019s central bank.\u00a0\u00a0\nAccording to NBC News, the finance blog ZeroHedge appears to have misconstrued the Interfax-Ukraine story and within an hour of publishing its own dispatch, the claim of an indictment had spread on Twitter by tens of thousands of users.\u00a0\nNina Jankowicz, a former adviser to Ukraine\u2019s foreign ministry and a disinformation researcher at the Wilson Center, told NBC the claims appear to be a misinterpretation of a press conference related to allegations \"about corruption with Burisma\u2019s head, which have been well known for a long time.\" She speculated that the lawmakers who held the press conference were angling for Trump\u2019s attention and trying to \"curry favor\" with his administration.\u00a0\nAnders Aslund, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who researches kleptocracy in Russia, told NBC that the lawmakers pushing new allegations at the press conference \u2014 Oleksandr Dubinsky and Andriy Derkach \u2014 are \"professional disinformers.\"\u00a0\n\"This is generally known in Ukraine,\" he said, \"this is not outstanding news. Anybody who\u2019s anybody knows about these two. They are not credible.\"\u00a0\nWe rate these Facebook posts False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16824"}
