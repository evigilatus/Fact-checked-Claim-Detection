It turns out that legitimating an employee is a back way for the government to voluntarily abandon your rights to arms. This article was referred to as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The federal law preceding the legal history prohibits users of controlled substances - including marijuana - from acquiring firearms. However, we found no evidence that the states had legitimized marijuana and then enacted their own laws to prevent cannabis users from owning a gun. Dozens of states have legitimized marijuana, and we've contacted each other to ask them about the article. No one was able to confirm the claim of the Facebook newspaper. Alex Traverso, spokesman for the Bureau of Cannabis Control in California, said that he had never heard such an allegation, and he had never seen anything about it in state regulations. Brian Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Board, said, \"There is no connection between buying recreational or medical marijuana and possessing a gun.\" \"The product hasn't been traced after the retail sale so there's no way to tie the two,\" he said. Madeleine Kane of the Oregon Alcohol Control Committee said that the Agency did not regulate firearms. But she said, \"We understood that what she described might be linked to federal policy.\" Because marijuana is still illegal under federal law, as Tara Dan, spokesman for the Department of Public Health and Environment of Colorado, is still classified as a controlled substance. Persons applying for a firearm must fill out a federal form asking in part for illegal use of marijuana. \"Warning,\" the form says under question about the illegal use of marijuana or other materials. \"The use or possession of marijuana remains illegal under federal law regardless of whether it has been legitimized or decriminalized for medical or recreational purposes in the state in which it resides.\" This means that marijuana users may refuse to buy a firearm, as Dan said. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 On January 11, 2012, we later moved to some marijuana experts to help us analyse federal and state laws. :: Matt Simone, New England &apos; s political director with the marijuana policy project, which calls for marijuana policy reforms, including decriminalization of marijuana use, said Facebook is alleged to be \"fully false.\" \"I am not aware of any government law on medical cannabis or an adult law that explicitly authorizes cannabis users to possess firearms.\" However, the possession of a firearm by a user of a controlled substance - including marijuana - had long been illegal under federal law. These are the policies of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, but not the law of the State. In some cases, Simon said that domestic law enforcement had implemented the federal ban. While the state law prohibits the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services from sharing information from the cannabis treatment patient register with federal agencies, Hawaii allows local police access to its cannabis medical record and that of firearms owners. Simon referred to the 2017 story of Miami Herald, which stated that the Honolulu Police Department had sent letters to all medical cannabis patients who were also registered as weapons owners and told them that they had 30 days to hand over their firearms. After the reaction, Simon said that the police department would not implement this policy. Some states have moved to protect the rights of medical marijuana users to use weapons. In Oklahoma, for example, the Governor signed a bill on 15 April stating that government and local agencies cannot deny people the rights to arms because they use medical marijuana. Earlier this year, the United States Republic of America introduced Alex Mooney, a western Virginia Republican, a bill that would amend federal law so that medical marijuana users would not be eligible for the purchase of a gun. (No action has been taken since its submission to the House of Representatives on 3 April). Our Facebook article says that almost every state has legitimized marijuana has also stipulated that people who use cannabis lose their right to own arms. We have found no evidence to support this claim. While federal law prohibits marijuana users from possessing a firearm, states do not legitimize cannabis and then enact legislation requiring marijuana users to lose their rights to use the weapon. We're categorizing this article on Facebook as wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00453"}
