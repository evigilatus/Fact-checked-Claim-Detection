The video\u2019s caption says: \"No workers present at the time that the Notre Dame Cathedral fire started......So who is this guy dressed in Muslim garb??\"\nThe video post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe person in the picture isn\u2019t dressed in \"Muslim garb\" \u2014\u00a0the person is\u00a0a firefighter.\nThe clip was plucked from CNBC\u2019s three-hour livestream of the fire and can be seen around the 42-minute mark.\nBecause the clip used in the Facebook post is blurry, pixelated and cropped, it\u2019s difficult to make out the firefighter's uniform or see the wider angle of water hoses being employed to the right of the tower. When viewing the official, full-length video, the man\u2019s yellow vest and helmet are clear and, moments later, several more firefighters show up in the same area. \u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe clip was also shared on Twitter, and European fact-checking outfits FactCheck EU and Check News both called out the bogus claim that a lone man was up to something sinister in the tower.\n\"No, there was no \u2018lone man in a yellow vest\u2019 in one of the Notre-Dame towers,\" FactCheck EU tweeted. \"A low quality video was the basis of the bogus claim that a mysterious man in a yellow vest was in a tower.

The Paris fire brigade has been quoted as saying the blaze may be \"potentially linked\" to the project.\nOur ruling\nA video clip posted on social media showed a man walking alone in one of Notre Dame\u2019s towers \"dressed in Muslim garb.\"\nThe clip is from an authentic media live stream of the Notre Dame fire, but displays a lower-quality and cropped version that doesn\u2019t allow the viewer to clearly see it was a firefighter. The clip also doesn\u2019t last long enough to show other firefighters who show up in the same area moments later, and is cropped to omit the water hoses being used to fight the fire.\nFrench authorities are conducting an investigation into the fire, but preliminary reports, so far, deem the cause as accidental, pointing to a possible link to the cathedral\u2019s renovation project.\nWe rate this Pants on Fire!\n Share the Facts 2019-04-16 22:22:36 UTC   PolitiFact    1 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Pants on Fire  A video clip from the Notre Dame cathedral fire shows a man walking alone in a tower of the church \"dressed in Muslim garb.\"    Facebook posts on the internet     Tuesday, April 16, 2019 2019-04-16    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00752"}
