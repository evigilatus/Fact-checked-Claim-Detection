Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch, who is running on the ticket with Gov. Scott Walker in the Nov. 4, 2014 election. They face Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mary Burke and her running mate, state Sen. John Lehman of Racine.\nThe ad makes a number of boasts about the Walker-Kleefisch administration, including this one: \"95 percent of job creators say Wisconsin is headed in the right direction.\"\nThat's decidedly favorable; but, the way the group states it, also misleading.\nPrevious claim\nWalker made a similar claim in February 2012, saying 94 percent of Wisconsin employers think the state \"is heading in the right direction\" and a majority say they will \"grow their companies in 2012.\"\nWe rated his statement Half True.\nBoth numbers were correct. But they came from a small survey by the pro-Walker Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce of some of its members.\nThe December 2011 survey of 281 chief executive officers amounted to a sample that is not reflective of the overall makeup of businesses in the state. For example, a majority of the survey respondents were manufacturing executives, but manufacturing establishments are just 6 percent of Wisconsin\u2019s businesses.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Godlewski\n\n\nstated on January 9, 2021 in Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all women that lost jobs (in the December jobs report), it was mostly Black and Latina women. In fact, white women gained employment.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Nusaiba Mizan \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWalker, however, presented the statistics without noting the critical limitations.\nNew survey\nWMC does its survey every other year. The latest one was conducted in November and December of 2013. This time, 95 percent of 341 CEOs said the state was going in the right direction.\nAnd that's the survey the national GOP group relies on in making its claim.\nBut that claim has the same problems as the one Walker made.\nOur rating\nThe Republican State Leadership Committee said: \"95 percent of job creators say Wisconsin is headed in the right direction.\"\nThe number is correct, but it comes from a small survey by one trade group and amounts to a sample that is not reflective of the overall makeup of state businesses.\nWe rate the claim Half True.\nTo comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\u2019s web page.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07089"}
