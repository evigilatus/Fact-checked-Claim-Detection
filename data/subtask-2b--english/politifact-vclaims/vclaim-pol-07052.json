Scott Walker:\n\"The nation as a whole has created jobs at a rate that is two times the rate that we have created jobs here in Wisconsin under Gov. Walker.\"\nAsked to back up the claim, the Burke campaign pointed us to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 quarterly employment surveys. That data is considered the most reliable measure of jobs, though it is less timely than that from separate monthly employment surveys.\nThe campaign told us the statistics show U.S. growth at \"nearly twice the rate\" of Wisconsin. Burke, though, was more definitive at the rally, saying \"two times the rate.\"\nBurke\u2019s phrasing of the talking point has changed.\nIn early 2014, she said the latest data from the quarterly surveys showed the national rate was \"nearly double\" Wisconsin\u2019s rate. At that point, she quoted a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story that came to the same conclusion after Wisconsin reported 1 percent growth compared with 1.9% nationally from June 2012 to June 2013.\nAt the time, that was the latest available data, due to the lag time in the release of the detailed quarterly numbers,\nWe crunched the same numbers the Burke campaign cited, examining private-sector employment, which has been the central focus of both candidates\u2019 plans.\nFigures show that from the start of Walker\u2019s term to the end of his third year, the national gain was 6.6 percent compared to Wisconsin\u2019s 4.1 percent. That meant the U.S. growth was 1.6 times that of Wisconsin\u2019s.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Godlewski\n\n\nstated on January 9, 2021 in Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all women that lost jobs (in the December jobs report), it was mostly Black and Latina women.

Same result: the national rate was 1.6 times better.\nAs we examined year-over-year growth at different quarterly vantage points, we repeatedly saw growth 1.6 to 1.7 times larger for the national figures.\n(We also looked at results from another government jobs survey, the monthly reports. They are more up to date -- through September 2014 -- but less reliable. They, too, show, national growth at 1.6 times the state\u2019s, from the start of Walker\u2019s term.)\nThere were some smaller and larger differences at various points along the way. Annual growth rates in the United States in 2011, 2012 and 2013, and into early 2014 ranged from 1.2 to 2 times larger than Wisconsin\u2019s.\nThe high point was from September 2011 to September 2012, when the rate was twice that of Wisconsin.\nOur rating\nBurke claimed that \"the nation as a whole has created jobs at a rate that is two times the rate that we have created jobs here in Wisconsin under Gov. Walker.\"\nWisconsin lags behind the nation significantly, but for the most part quite not as badly as Burke says, based on the last year and on results from most of Walker\u2019s term.\nWe rate the claim Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07052"}
