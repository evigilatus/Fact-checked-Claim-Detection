Trump presented the same statistics when he presented his economic policies in a speech in Pennsylvania in June. This letter went to more details, and, better than everything, to fact-checkers, I campaigned it with a footnote to its sources in the text. As he did in the forum, Trump misspoke in this policy speech to Clinton. \"At the centre of this disaster are two commercial deals driven by Bill and Hillary Clinton,\" he said in Pennsylvania. First, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) or the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Second, China's entry into the World Trade Organization.\" And as we looked at Trump's words, we found that his numbers were good. The impact of trade transactions on industrialization, and its isolation from Clinton, is more problematic. By the way, while Hillary Clinton has played no official role in either agreement, in the past it has come in their favour, even if she has noticed their flaws. Data from the Bureau of Labour Statistics show that industrial jobs fell by approximately 30 per cent between 1997 and 2016. Some 17.4 million people were engaged in manufacturing at the beginning of the period. Today, their ranks have fallen to about 12.3 million people. Trump's got the right numbers. The North American Free Trade Agreement dates back to 1994 and established an open trade zone throughout Mexico, the United States and Canada. The agreement with China was not a trade agreement in the same way. Instead, in 2001, Congress paved the way for China to become part of the World Trade Organization. This has led to lower tariffs, stimulated investment in China, and resulted in more movement of goods. While Tramp regularly states that NAFTA has sent jobs to Mexico, the net effect on all jobs, including manufacturing, is difficult to stabilize. On the contrary, there is widespread agreement that change with China has cost America millions of jobs. The Congressional Research Service, the Congressional non-partisan think tank, concluded in 2015 that NAFTA was unlikely to have a significant impact on jobs in one way or another. This is generally the consensus view, although some economists believe that NAFTA has damaged American jobs. In China, research by economists Justin Pierce at the Federal Reserve Bank and Peter Schutt at Yale University indicates that more than a million jobs have been lost because of trade with China. Trump relied heavily on the research of Robert Scott, Director of Trade and Industrialization Policy Research at the Institute of Economic Policy, to make his point of view clear. The Institute is not traditionally used by Republicans. It supports a significant increase in the minimum wage and increased taxes on the rich and companies. Scott estimates that America has lost over 700,000 jobs to Mexico and about 2 million industrial jobs due to the growing trade deficit with China. But Scott excludes Trump from using his work. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" By Samantha Buterman: January 11, 2021, \"The story is complex, and certainly neither Clinton's deals, nor business deals alone, explain the loss of 5.3 million industrial jobs since 1998, when manufacturing employment peaked,\" Scott told us. \"No one's raised enough all the reasons.\" In an op-ed article, Scott cited several other factors that affected American workers, including the policies of the Federal Reserve Bank, the stagnation of the minimum wage and the lack of public investment in infrastructure. Martin Bailey, a business economist at the Brookings Institution, an academic centre in Washington, D.C., puts fewer stakes in the impact of the two trade agreements. It refers to long-term trends. \"The share of manufacturing employment in total employment in the United States has been declining for at least 50 years and the rate of decline in that share has not accelerated because of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) or China,\" said Bailey. He told us that as much as Americans like flat-screen television and other goods, our demand for services such as health care has increased faster. This has led to a reduction in manufacturing employment opportunities. And then there's the impact of technology on factories. \"Producive growth means that fewer people are needed to make goods,\" said Billy. It is therefore fair to say that the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) may or may not have reduced American industrial functions (with the fall of consensus on the non-existent side), and that the China deal may have been. In any case, however, economists do not place the entire number of jobs lost in any trade transaction. The third part of Trump's claim is that business transactions and their alleged failures are Clinton's fault. This is another shaky part of Trump &apos; s claim. Scott noted at the Institute of Economic Policy that \"most of the votes needed to pass the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1993 were from members of the Trump Party itself.\" President Bill Clinton was definitely supportive, but he got a lot of Republican help. Susan Hausmann, Senior Economist at the Abjon Employment Research Institute, a labour policy centre in Michigan, said that industrial jobs had grown in the years immediately following the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement. They didn't fall fast until after China's deal. The man of the house told us the details of that were resolved under the leadership of President George W. Bush. \"The sharp decline in manufacturing jobs coincided with China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001, which in any case was supported by both democratic and republican administrations,\" said Hausmann. Our rule, Trump, said that America had lost about one third of its manufacturing functions since 1997 after the enactment of two commercial deals supported by Bill and Hillary Clinton. Government figures show a 30 per cent decrease in industrial jobs. Bill Clinton called both agreements. While Hillary Clinton played no official role, she spoke in favour of trade agreements. However, the Trump Statement overlooks the rise in manufacturing employment after the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The general consensus among economists is that the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) did not help or harm American workers overall. There is broad agreement that China &apos; s entry into the World Trade Organization came at the expense of many American industrial jobs, with estimates ranging from about 1 to 2 million. But that would be less than half of the industrial jobs Trump lost. The Trump focus on Clinton also overlooks the key role of the Republicans. In the name of the Clinton, at least half of the picture is left. There's a certain amount of right in Trump's words, but he misses a lot of important information. We're assessing this claim half right. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/874386ed-8192-432c-b8c0-2e23b3e98f4f", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04634"}
