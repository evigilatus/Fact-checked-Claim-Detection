The full quote says: \"Don't be afraid of the enemy, because your enemy can only kill you. You'd better be afraid of the media because they're gonna steal your honor. That terrible force, the public opinion of the nation, was created in America by a crowd of ignorant, self-absorbed naives who failed to give up and make shoes. The article was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Twin himself was a member of the press, but he had a troubled relationship with journalists. He spoke of part of this statement and was tireless in criticizing journalists - but he never used the phrase \"fear the media.\" :: During the time period in which Tween was alive (from the mid-19th century to the early 20th century), the term \"media\" was not used in the way he was used today, as there was only one form of mass communication - printing. We found no evidence that Tween said or wrote the first half of the quote: \"Don't be afraid of the enemy, because your enemy can only kill you. You'd better be afraid of the media because they're gonna steal your honor. In response to a question from the Politifact newspaper, the editor of the Mark Twain Allen Gribben newspaper also stated that he doubted that Twain had used the word \"media\" in this context. On January 12, 2021, he wrote in an Instagram article saying that Joe Biden remained silent about the violence in Black Lives-Mite protests. \u2022 On January 16, 2012, we reached out to Barbara Schmidt, researcher and writer Mark Twain, who runs Twin Quets.com. Schmidt referred to a speech by Twain in March 1873, entitled \"The Press Law,\" in which Twain said the second part of the quote. The title, delivered by Tuan in Hartford, Con, contained his consistent assessment of the power of the press and the inequity that he felt was rooted in the fact that laws existed to protect freedom of expression, but did not protect people from the press: \"This heinous force, the public opinion of the nation, was created in America by a crowd of self-absorbed, ignorant naive people who failed to abandon the shoe industry and bring them to the press on their way to the poor house. I am personally familiar with hundreds of journalists, and the majority view will not be worthy of silence in private, but when they speak in printed newspapers, it is the newspaper that speaks (the pygmy writer is not visible) and then their words shake society like the thunder of prophecy.\" Our social media position is attributed to Mark Twain saying that it is \"a lot better\" for \"the fear of the media\" and \"that awful force, the public of the nation, was created in America by a crowd of ignorant, naive, self-absorbed people.\" Twain certainly had some things to say about the power of the press and the freedoms that some members of the press felt during his life. But the first half of the quote -- we'd better be afraid of the media on the \"enemy\" because the media will \"take your honor\" -- seems to be fabricated. The second part of the quotation accurately reflects the words he said during an address in 1873. That's why we're doing it half right.
