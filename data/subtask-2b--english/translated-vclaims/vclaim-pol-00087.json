However, the Republicans, including Trump, who seized the Thames reports erred in claiming that the reports indicated that Shiv helped write the complaint himself. The second story of October said that Shiv - Chairman of the Intelligence Committee of the House of Representatives, which was investigating Trump - had been informed of the complaints of whistleblowers prior to their official submission. The newspaper stated that the CIA officer who submitted the complaint had contacted an assistant to the Committee for advice on how to proceed in addressing concerns about the July telephone call with the President of Ukraine. The article explained how Chev, D-Calif, was aware of the pressure to release the whistleblower complaint, which the Trump administration had tried before to withhold from Congress. On the same day that the Times published its report, several right-wing outlets jumped on the story, claiming that it showed that the whistleblowers were \"connected\" with the Democrats at home. During a press conference, Tramp Schiff claimed \"maybe he helped write\" the complaint and called it a trick. Facebook was published the same day and took a step further, Ms. Shiv and Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Belusi, D-Calif. I worked with lawyers to \"break the complaint.\" Someone else says: \"Nancy Belusi and Adam Schiff were involved with lawyers who were complicit in the liberation and formation of the \"comprehensive complaint\" before it was corrupted.\" These articles were referred to as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) What we know is that Shiv \"knows about the outline\" of the whistleblowers' complaint from the deputy intelligence committee of the House of Representatives who consulted with the CIA officer, and he's not gonna be able to help us. The Times didn't mention that Chef helped write, or invented the complaint. The Times Reports, which relied on anonymous sources and was confirmed by the Washington Post, show that the whistleblowers approached one of Shiv's associates with only a vague charge against Trump. The assistant told the CIA officer to find a lawyer and then told Chief some of what the whistleblowers told them. The assistant did not indicate the identity of the officer with Shiv. The main concern of the whistleblower was the Trump telephone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelinski on 25 July. The relevant story: In time: In the Tramp investigation: The distinctive picture of the fact-checking mentioned on January 10, 2021 in an article on Facebook, Nancy Belusi says: Trump sent a letter to the Mayor of Portland after demonstrations there \"inducing him to abide by a proven democratic playbook.\" This request came after Trump had frozen nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine. The whistleblower contacted the assistant of the Intelligence Committee of the Chamber of Deputies sometime before submitting the official complaint to the Inspector General of the Intelligence Service on 12 August. An official investigation into the Trump case was announced by Pelosi on 24 September, led by Shiv. The Washington Post article states that it is not common for the Intelligence Committee of the House of Representatives to receive informal investigations from whistleblowers before filing a formal complaint, according to \"current and former whistleblowers.\" The officer only conveyed their concerns to the committee after having a colleague take them to the biggest CIA lawyer, which led to the CIA alerting the White House. This freaked whistleblowers to take their fears straight home, New York Times report. What Shiv and Shiv say is that Shiv received some information about the whistleblower's complaint before formally presenting it to Congress. However, the Intelligence Committee of the House of Representatives and a lawyer representing the whistleblowers told us that the complaint had been drafted independently of Shiv's contribution, and we found no evidence to the contrary. At the same time, Trump and the Republicans did not provide any evidence indicating that Shiv had assisted in the drafting or drafting of the complaint. We asked the Intelligence Committee of the House of Representatives what Chev learned from the assistant about the complaint of whistleblowers. A spokesperson refused to comment on the details of that interaction, but denied that Shiv had any direct contact with the whistleblowers. \"As President Shiv explained, he did not know who the whistleblowers were, did not have any contact with them or their lawyers, and did not consider the complaint of the whistleblowers until the day before the hearing with the National Intelligence Service (DNI) when he finally provided it (Office of the Director of National Intelligence) to the Commission,\" the Committee's spokesperson said in an e-mail. Related story: Covering Polyte Vact Trump, Ukraine-Baiden in one place, we also contacted Mark Zed, the lawyer representing the CIA officer. He also said that he could not comment on what Schiff knew about the concerns of the whistleblowers, but that the officer \"drafted the complaint in its entirety on their own.\" \"In fact, no one from the legal team saw the complaint until it was publicly published by Congress,\" said Zedd in the e-mail. \"To be unequivocal, no member or official of Congress had any input or review of the complaint before submitting it to the Inspector General of the Intelligence Society. Neither the amount nor the legal team met with this complaint nor even discussed it with Congressman Chef.\" Many Facebook articles claimed that Shiv helped write a reporter's complaint against Trump. We still do not know exactly what information Shiv has received on whistleblower concerns. But there's no evidence to suggest that Chev knew who the reporter was, let alone helped them draft this complaint. The Facebook bulletins exceed what has been reported. In the absence of any further evidence, the allegation that Shiv helped write the whistleblower complaint is inaccurate. We're assessing the wrong Facebook flyers.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00087"}
