Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 20, 2017\n\nFor the record, Ossoff has said he would oppose any increase in income taxes.\nSince this is the second time in less than 24 hours that Trump has brought up Ossoff\u2019s residency, we thought we\u2019d clear that up.\nHe tweeted on Monday, June 19, \"Karen Handel's opponent in #GA06 can't even vote in the district he wants to represent because he doesn't even live there!\"\nTrump is correct.\nThis is not news in Georgia. By February, Ossoff was fielding questions on where he lives. He acknowledged that he and his girlfriend (now fiancee) live near Emory University where she\u2019s in medical school. That\u2019s next door to the 6th District, but not in it.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen CNN brought it up, Ossoff said he plans to move back to the district.\n\"As soon as she concludes her medical training, I will be back into the district where I grew up, but I want to support her and her career and do right by her,\" he said. \"I will be 10 minutes back up the road where I grew up.\"\nHow far away is he from the district\u2019s boundaries?\nAccording to Ossoff\u2019s biography on his website, he was raised in Northlake, an unincorporated community in the 6th District. Taking nothing for granted, we mapped the distance from the Emory University campus to his old stomping grounds. According to Google, it\u2019s about 6 miles and takes about 17\u00a0minutes to drive, non-rush hour.\n\nOssoff told MSNBC he lives about two miles from the district line. The medical school itself is about four miles away,\u00a0and according to Google, about a 12-minute drive.\nTo round out the picture, Ossoff\u2019s opponent, Republican Karen Handel, grew up in the Maryland suburbs of Washington and has lived in the 6th District for 25 years.\nOur ruling\nTrump said Ossoff doesn\u2019t live in the 6th District. That is correct. Depending on how you map it, he lives about 2\u00a0to 6 miles either from the district or the neighborhood where he was raised.\nWe rate this claim True.
