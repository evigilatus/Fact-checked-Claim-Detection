In the face of opposition to the deal, Jove. Andrew Como issued statements and participated in a round of media interviews to talk about the Amazon decision. During an interview with the New York Sports Centre, the host asked Brian Lehrer Komo about the kind of general oversight that would exist before the Amazon plans were finalized. The Komo response addressed the project approval process, as well as the financial incentives provided to the Amazon region. \"There's nothing we've done in the Amazon that we haven't done with hundreds of other projects,\" said Komo. \"There are hundreds of businesses in New York that receive these kinds of tax exemptions and capital grants, because, competitively, we have to work hard to get people to come here because of our tax structure.\" So the Amazon deal with the state of New York isn't unique? The State provided services in the Amazon region amounting to $1.7 billion, and New York City to $1.8 billion, according to an analysis by the Citizens &apos; Budget Committee. In general, the value of benefits increases as the number of jobs created by the Amazon increases. The State provides up to $1.2 billion in tax exemptions from Excelsior Gobs, and a capital grant of up to $505 million, according to the State Budget Division. Excelsior credits are linked to the Amazon commitment to provide 25,000 jobs and invest $2.3 billion. The capital grant is linked to that initial commitment, as well as to other phases: up to 40,000 jobs and $3.6 billion in total investments. The types of incentives offered to the Amazon have been offered to many companies. Excelsior Gobs is \"the main vehicle for state economic development,\" and on June 30, it recognized 571 companies operating in 600 projects, as stated by Budget Division spokesman Maurice Peters. Peters said that the capital grant, although discretionary, had been offered to \"thousands\" of other companies. The State spent $750 million in taxpayers &apos; funds to build and equip the River Bind plant in Buffalo and provided $70 million to Reginan in the capital area. Some have criticized the state and the city for saying that a wealthy company like the Amazon does not need $3 billion in subsidies. Peters said that reasonable analysis would recognize that investments in the Amazon region and employment creation commitments were higher than other enterprises in the State, and therefore incentives were higher. However, James Barrot, who was the main economist for economic development initiatives in New York City in the early 1990s, said that reasonable analysis would put incentives in the context of New York &apos; s appeal to the technology sector, including a skilled workforce, as well as the city &apos; s rapid economy. \"How can you justify this level of support in this context?\" He asked Barot, who was now Director of Economic and Financial Policy at the New York City Center for New School Affairs. So who provides supervision of the Amazon deal? Colin Schmidt mentioned at a press conference on January 14, 2021 \"We have scientific data, from all different levels, but especially from high school sports levels, from many different states that show that it's safe to play what New York thinks of high-risk sports.\" This plan will be submitted to the Control Board for approval. Public project plans have been used in projects such as Atlantica Yards, Brooklyn Bridge Park and Time Square for redevelopment, according to the Citizens &apos; Budget Committee. It requires data on environmental impact and requires general input, but there is no domestic control over the approval process. While the project &apos; s neighbours and local elected officials may be disturbed by this, this top-down approach can be more attractive to companies. In a radio interview, Mayor Bell de Blacio said that if the city used its usual operation, \"there is a very high probability that these jobs will not come here.\" One reason that defenders of Long Island City are opposed to the Amazon Plan is to avoid a uniform procedure for reviewing land use in the city and circumventing the city council. He said Benjamin Dolchin, Executive Director of the New York City Association for the Development of Life and Housing, an advocacy organization for affordable housing. However, Peters, spokesman for the State Budget Division, which is part of the executive branch of Komo, said that projects offering capital construction grants used the overall project plan process, thousands of which were throughout the state. Since it is unclear whether \"we\" Komo refers to state or state and city negotiators - attempts to reach the Governor's spokesman have not succeeded - we will discuss the city's incentives, but put them aside when assessing the validity of the Kumo statement. De Blacio said that the city &apos; s incentives to the Amazon would be available to any qualified company, and that other incentives offered by the city in the past had not been offered to the Amazon. These include tax exemptions for the registration of mortgages, tax exemptions for sales, the most important tax exemptions on property, and tax exemptions on income in the city, according to James Pachet, President and Executive Director of the New York City Economic Development Corporation. Two of the main city incentives provided to the Amazon, known as right-wing incentives, are available to the company under existing state laws. The city expects the Amazon region to benefit from the reduction of the property tax by $386 million from a programme promoting growth in certain regions, known as the Industrial and Commercial Reduction Programme, or the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan. Between $900 million and $1.44 billion in incentives, depending on whether the Amazon creates 25,000 or 40,000 jobs, have also been provided to the Amazon region from a programme for companies moving from out of the city to certain areas, known as the Transport and Expansion Reduction Programme, or the Resettlement Programme. The agreement also calls for an agreement between the city and the Amazon on the payment of taxes, or an agreement between the company PLOT, in which the Amazon pays the city the same amount as they pay in property taxes, according to the Deputy Mayor Alicia Glen. One of the most unpopular incentives from the city, and most strange, is the promise to help the Amazon set up a helicopter platform at the site, or nearby. The same deal, the largest Reenvent Albany, which calls for transparency in government, opposes these kinds of tax incentives. However, the Executive Director of the group said that Kumu's statement was correct. \"It's quite accurate on his part, unfortunately,\" said Renvent Albany Executive Director John Kahny. \"This is only big because of its size.\" David Friedville, Director of State Studies at the Citizens &apos; Budget Committee, said that the nature of the incentives provided to the Amazon was similar to those provided to other companies. Another expert from the Rockefeller Institute of Government described the Amazon deal as a big deal, but it is not outside the scope of other State transactions. Laura Schultz, Director of Financial Analysis and Chief Economist at the Rockefeller Institute, a think tank affiliated with the State University of New York, said that the State had provided further incentives on a post-by-job basis in 2009 to global institutions in Malta, and in 2014 to the city of Solar, later purchased by Tesla, in Buffalo. A capital construction grant of $665 million was offered to global institutions, and a capital construction grant of up to $750 million was awarded to Tesla, then called the city of Solar. With the combination of tax incentives and capital grants, $931,741 was presented to global institutions for each job, and Tesla was offered incentives equivalent to $150,000 per job, as Schultz said. If the Amazon creates 40,000 jobs and receives maximum incentives from the state of New York, the cost of each job for the state will be $42.625. This figure changes under different employment scenarios and when incorporating city incentives. Because Excelsior's tax exemptions were linked to salaries, and because Amazon salaries promised an average of $150,000, Schultz said that incentives were higher. \"So while the Amazon will receive the largest total tax exemption ever offered by the program, this is due to the large number and high salaries of expected jobs,\" she said. \"The amount per job is higher than the average, but not the highest of the State.\" Our government. Andrew Como said that the incentives offered to the Amazon were the same as those offered to \"hundreds\" of other companies. We looked into government subsidies and found that other companies offered them the types of subsidies to the Amazon. However, the amount of subsidies, including the estimated capital grant, is larger than many previous projects undertaken by the State. The project &apos; s general plan process, criticized for not requiring the approval of the city council, has also been used in hundreds of state-wide projects that have been awarded capital construction grants. We appreciate Como's rises with health.
