Elissa Slotkin\u2019s record of bipartisanship", "text": "In 2018, Democrat Elissa Slotkin flipped a congressional district Donald Trump won in 2016, unseating the Republican incumbent. Back on the campaign trail, she has told voters in the 8th district that while in Washington, she has worked as an independent and bipartisan lawmaker.\nSlotkin\u2019s Republican challenger Paul Junge \u2014 a former prosecutor and TV anchor \u2014 disputes that. \"Candidate Slotkin had presented herself as a moderate and as someone who\u2019d be independent-minded but her time in office is making it increasingly clear that no, she is very partisan, voting 96% of the time with Speaker Pelosi,\" Junge said during a Sept. 11 interview on the WDET radio program \"Detroit Today.\"\nJunge points\u00a0to the fact that Slotkin has voted 96% of the time with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as evidence that\u00a0Slotkin is more liberal than her moderate image suggests. Junge has also pointed to the fact that Slotkin has voted 90% of the time with \"The Squad,\"\u00a0a group of liberal Democratic congresswomen including Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts.\n\"Congresswoman Slotkin's record of voting with Nancy Pelosi 96% of the time and 90% with \"squad\" members like Rashida Tlaib make it clear she has aligned herself with the most radical elements of her party after promising to be a moderate. Any thoughtful examination of her record leads to the conclusion that she puts party over country again and again,\" Rob Wagener, spokesman for the Junge campaign, wrote in an email to PolitiFact Michigan.\nDuring her interview on \"Detroit Today\" on Sept. 11, Slotkin countered that while in Congress, she has \"voted over 800 times, and 640 of those votes are bipartisan where we\u2019ve got Democrats and Republicans voting for the same bill.\" She has also noted that she has voted against her party 55 times.\nThe numbers have changed slightly since the campaign conducted this analysis before Congress\u2019 August recess, but considering Slotkin\u2019s most recent votes generally yields the same result: About 77% of the votes Slotkin has taken during her first term in Congress had the support of at least one Republican member of Congress.\n\"While there are many ways to define bipartisanship, by any measure, Congresswoman Slotkin is among the most bipartisan members of Congress,\" Gordon Trowbridge, spokesperson for Slotkin\u2019s campaign, wrote in an email to PolitiFact Michigan.\nCongressional experts say the raw vote figures cited by Junge and Slotkin offer an incomplete picture of a lawmaker\u2019s record of partisanship, and say Slotkin\u2019s definition of bipartisanship as voting the same way as at least one Republican is not very informative.\nAnalysts point instead to other scoring systems that compare lawmakers' voting records with other members of their political party and to their record of collaborating on legislation with members of the other party.\nFor Slotkin, who has branded herself as a moderate and bipartisan member of Congress, these indicators show that her record is indeed consistent with her campaign rhetoric, and that Junge\u2019s characterization of her as a liberal Democrat and very partisan is off the mark.\nJunge\u2019s claims on Slotkin voting with Pelosi and \"The Squad\"\nDuring her first term in Congress, Slotkin has voted the same way as Speaker Pelosi 96% of the time, according to ProPublica, a national investigative news organization. The figure is based on 75 votes cast by Speaker Pelosi who, by tradition, votes at her discretion. Slotkin has also voted 89% of the time with Reps. Ocasio-Cortez, Omar and Tlaib; and 90% with Rep. Pressley, according to ProPublica.\nSo Slotkin has frequently voted the same way as her party\u2019s leadership. Members of the House often vote consistently with their party's leader. The vast majority of Democratic lawmakers in the current Congress have voted with Pelosi at least 90% of the time.\nSlotkin has also voted consistently with liberal Democrats.\nBut congressional experts warn against using raw vote totals as an indicator of partisanship. \"Raw vote counts are misleading without context, especially with a high percentage of non-controversial votes,\" wrote Ian Ostrander, an assistant professor of American politics at Michigan State University. \"Some votes matter much more than others.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Gateway Pundit\n\n\nstated on February 5, 2021 in an article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNewly discovered video shows late night deliveries of tens of thousands of illegal ballots 8 hours after deadline.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Clara Hendrickson \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSlotkin\u2019s record on bipartisan and independent votes\nIn response to Junge\u2019s claims, Slotkin pointed out the number of times she has voted with Republican members of Congress and against her own party.\nAn analysis of the most recent data from Voteview shows that Slotkin has voted against her own party 55 times, and that 677 of the 879 votes Slotkin has taken during her term in Congress \u2014 about 77% \u2014 had the support of at least one Republican member.\nExperts agree this is not a great definition of bipartisanship.\n\"By her metric, if she, 230 other Democrats, and one Republican voted for a bill, then she's voting in a bipartisan fashion. That's just silly,\" wrote Christian Fong, an assistant professor of political science at the University of Michigan, in an email to PolitiFact Michigan.\nOther metrics for evaluating Slotkin\u2019s record\nCongressional scholars often rely on what\u2019s called the Nominate score, which measures a member\u2019s ideology based on their voting record. The metric, developed by political scientists Keith Poole and Howard Rosenthal in the 1980s, provides a general sense of how liberal or conservative a member\u2019s voting record is. UCLA\u2019s Department of Political Science and Social Science Computing computes members' Nominate scores today.\nNominate scores fall along a scale of -1 to 1, with -1 being the most liberal end of the spectrum and 1 as the most conservative. Slotkin\u2019s Nominate score is -0.308, making her voting record more conservative than 68% of Democrats in the House.\nSlotkin\u2019s Nominate score also shows she has staked out less liberal positions on votes than Pelosi.\nLooking at the measures members have co-sponsored rather than votes, GovTrack, an independent congressional tracker, ranked Slotkin among the most conservative Democrats in Congress in 2019.\nFong suggests voters should consider other metrics of bipartisanship too: \"Has she gotten any Republicans to cosponsor her bills? What Republican-led initiatives did she support? Are there any Republican colleagues with whom she's developed a strong working relationship?\"\nThe Bipartisan Index from the Lugar Center and Georgetown University\u2019s McCourt School of Public Policy provides some answers. It measures how often lawmakers work with members of the other party on sponsoring and co-sponsoring legislation. It finds Slotkin has frequently co-sponsored bills introduced by the Republican Party and attracted Republican co-sponsors for the bills she has introduced, and ranked her in the top 25% of House lawmakers in 2019.\nAccording to GovTrack, 10 of Slotkin\u2019s 15 bills and resolutions in 2019 had a Republican cosponsor.\nIn June 2019, Slotkin joined the Problem Solvers Caucus, a group made up of an equal number of Democratic and Republican House members who try to identify bipartisan policy solutions.\nOur ruling\nJunge said that Slotkin \"presented herself as a moderate\" and \"independent-minded\" but instead she has acted \"very partisan\" during her first term.\nIndependent analyses indicate Slotkin\u2019s voting and legislative records are more conservative and bipartisan than most of her Democratic colleagues\u2019.\nJunge highlighted one metric \u2014 Slotkin\u2019s record of voting with Speaker Pelosi and liberal House members \u2014 as evidence. He ignores other metrics that would give a different impression.\nWe rate Junge\u2019s claim Mostly False.\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections FactChat #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click here\u00a0for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18973"}
