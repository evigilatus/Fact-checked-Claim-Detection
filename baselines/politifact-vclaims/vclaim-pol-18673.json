Joe Biden's a career politician who spent decades raising taxes. \u2026 So what would the Biden plan do for you? Raise your taxes? That's it.\"\nWould Biden really raise taxes by 14% on middle-income families? There\u2019s zero evidence of that. (The 82% statistic is also incorrect.)\nBiden\u2019s proposed changes would repeal provisions in President Donald Trump\u2019s tax law for taxpayers earning over $400,000. Specifically, Biden would:\n\n\nIncrease the top corporate tax rate to 28% from 21%;\n\n\nRaise the top individual federal income tax rate to 39.6%;\n\n\nPlace a 12.4% Social Security tax on incomes above $400,000;\n\n\nTax capital gains at the same rate as ordinary income for very high earners.\n\n\nAll of this is targeted toward the highest earners, those earning $400,000 or more per year. So where does the alleged 14% tax hike on middle-income Americans come from? That\u2019s unclear.\n\nA screenshot from the Trump campaign's recent ad.\nThe MarketWatch article\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to inquiries for this article. The ad footnotes the assertion with a reference to an article from the financial website MarketWatch on March 4, 2020, when Biden was still in the thick of his party\u2019s presidential primary.\nThe MarketWatch article provides no support for the 14% assertion in the Trump ad.\u00a0\nThe only mention of 14% in the article refers to the plan offered by one of Biden\u2019s primary opponents, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. The article said that Warren would \"assess a 14.8% high-income social security tax on the top bracket.\" But not only was that provision not part of Biden\u2019s plan, but it was also specifically targeted at the top tax bracket, not middle-income Americans.\nIndependent tax analyses\nTaking a step back from the MarketWatch article, we also see no evidence that Biden\u2019s plan would produce such a big tax hike on middle-income taxpayers.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the 2017 tax law, \u201cpeople who make under $75,000 will have their taxes raised in 2021 and every 2 years after that until 2027.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral independent groups of varied ideologies assessed the impacts of Biden\u2019s tax plan earlier this year.\u00a0\nThey projected that some of the burden of Biden\u2019s tax increases would fall to people making less than $400,000 in the form of lower wages or investment returns. This would be a result of Biden\u2019s proposal to hike the corporate tax rate. Unlike direct changes to individual tax rates and income thresholds, the impact of the corporate tax rate on ordinary Americans\u2019 tax returns is indirect and difficult to measure.\nThe Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a group that\u2019s hawkish on the federal budget deficit, said that \"overall, Biden\u2019s tax plan would make the tax code more progressive, with the vast majority of increased tax burdens and the entirety of direct tax increases falling on high-income households.\"\nThe group summarized four other groups\u2019 assessments of how Biden\u2019s tax plan would affect members of the lowest, second-lowest, middle, second-highest, and highest income quintiles. The four analyses were conducted by the American Enterprise Institute, the Tax Foundation, the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, and the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School.\nAs the following chart shows, no quintile \u2014 even the top one \u2014 would see anything close to a 14% tax increase due to the Biden plan. Only the top 1% of earners would see anything approaching that degree of increase.\n\nAccording to the Tax Policy Center\u2019s analysis, the lowest income group would see their incomes drop by $30. The next would see a drop of $110; the middle would see a drop of $260; and the second-highest, with incomes up to $170,000, would see a loss of $590.\nAdditional tax cuts\nMeanwhile, Biden has also proposed a number of tax cuts that were not included in the analyses above. Here are some of the bigger cuts being proposed by the campaign:\u00a0\n\u2022 A temporarily expanded child tax credit, worth $3,000 per child for children ages 6 to 17 and $3,600 for children under 6. Biden would make the credit fully refundable.\n\u2022 A $15,000 permanent tax credit for first-time homebuyers that could be advanced to the claimant rather than waiting until the following tax year.\n\u2022 A refundable tax credit for health insurance premiums.\n\u2022 Up to $8,000 in tax credits to help pay for child care.\nIt\u2019s entirely possible that these proposed cuts would wipe out the increases from the corporate tax hike, making the assertion in Trump\u2019s ad even more wrong.\nThe initial analysis \"does not provide support for Trump's claim that Biden's plan will raise taxes by 14% for middle-class families,\" said Eric Toder, a fellow at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. \"Not even close.\"\nOur ruling\nThe Trump ad said that \"Biden's plan is a 14% tax hike on middle class families.\"\nThere is no evidence for this assertion. The article cited in the ad says nothing about this, and analyses by independent think tanks found a much smaller indirect hit from the corporate tax hike, one that could well be reversed by larger-scale tax cuts that Biden has proposed and that are currently being analyzed.\nWe rate the statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18673"}
