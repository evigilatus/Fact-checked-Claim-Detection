By this count, the nation has gained a net 514,000 private-sector jobs -- an amount only one-tenth the size of what Obama claimed. However, this method has its drawbacks, because no president can have much impact in the first few months on the job.\n\nA middle-ground position is to start the count at the official beginning of the recovery, which came in June 2009. From June 2009 until today, the nation has gained roughly 3.6 million private-sector jobs. That\u2019s less than Obama claims, but more than the inauguration-day calculation the Romney camp often prefers.\n\nIt's also worth noting that economists say that presidents have a relatively modest impact on the ups and downs of jobs, so it can be a stretch to give Obama either credit for good job numbers or blame for weak job numbers.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA final note: Private-sector job numbers are a credible yardstick, but they do paint a more favorable picture for the president than total job numbers do, since government jobs have been shrinking in recent years. Since June 2009, the nation has gained a little under 3 million total jobs, compared to 3.6 million using private-sector jobs alone.\n\nOur ruling\n\nObama said that his administration has created \"5 million jobs \u2026 over the last 30 months in the private sector alone.\" That\u2019s true only using the most cherry-picked time frame. A more reasonable method -- starting the count at the beginning of the recovery -- shows a gain of 3.6 million jobs.\nThat\u2019s still a substantial number, but well short of the 5 million Obama claimed.\n\nWe rate the statement Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10149"}
