He then alleged that when elections in neighboring Massachusetts are not close, Democrats are \"busing them in all over the place\" and picking a phony address for people to use for same-day registration.\n\"There\u2019s no doubt there\u2019s election fraud,\" he said. \"I don\u2019t want to use \u2018rigged\u2019 -- that\u2019s the word you\u2019re not supposed to use anymore -- but they have really gamed the system to their advantage.\"\nAt a time when many people, including Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, are warning about \"rigged elections\" well before the votes are counted, we thought we\u2019d check whether Sununu\u2019s allegation was accurate.\nWe found that while New Hampshire is not without election day fraud, it has not happened on a widespread scale, the state\u2019s top election official says. And crucially for Sununu\u2019s charge, he was unable to produce any evidence of buses of out-of-state voters coming into the state.\n\"In every election since 2000, there\u2019s been someone prosecuted for election fraud,\" said New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner. Some out-of-state residents have voted in the state\u2019s elections, while others have been New Hampshire residents voting in more than one town.\nSince 2012, the attorney general\u2019s office has prosecuted two criminal fraud cases and one civil fraud case and investigated other complaints, Assistant Attorney General Brian Buonamano said.\nGardner emphasized that fraud has not proven to be a widespread problem.\n\"I have no basis to say it\u2019s rampant, and there are ways we can deal with it,\" he said. Gardner said he used to have more qualms about out-of-state voters sneaking past election workers, but the state\u2019s Voter ID law has reassured him.\nThe law requires voters to show a valid ID at the polls. If they don\u2019t have one, their picture is taken and they have to sign an affidavit swearing they are who they say they are. After the election is over, the Secretary of State\u2019s office will send out confirmation letters to those people.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I said that three or four years ago; I wouldn\u2019t say that now based on the safeguards that we have included in the process,\" he said.\nSununu walked back his comments on Tuesday.\n\"No, I don\u2019t want to imply I see buses coming over,\" he said, when asked if he could name a specific instance of Democrats busing voters in to vote in New Hampshire elections. \"It\u2019s more a figure of speech that people are coming over, they\u2019re temporarily here, they vote and then they leave.\"\nSununu said he was referring to an incident over Portsmouth state Sen. Martha Fuller Clark allowing Democratic staffers to live at her house in the 2008 and 2012 elections. Those staffers voted in New Hampshire elections using Fuller Clark\u2019s address, which is not illegal, as they were living in the state at least 3 months before the election, the Attorney General later ruled.\nSununu said he would like to tighten the state\u2019s election laws to \"make sure that our votes, the true residents of NH are not being diluted by out of staters.\"\nWe should also note that Sununu\u2019s point about same-day registration being passed by Democrats was also incorrect. The same-day registration law was signed by Republican Gov. Steve Merrill in 1994.\nGardner said Republicans at the time were far more supportive of same-day registration, which they saw as a preferable local alternative to the federal \"Motor Voter\" law that required state governments to offer voter registration opportunities when they applied for a driver\u2019s license.\nOur ruling\nSununu said Democrats take advantage of New Hampshire\u2019s same-day voter registration laws to bus voters in from out of state.\nWhile New Hampshire has experienced instances of voter fraud, the state\u2019s top election official says they have been isolated and amount to one or two cases a year.\nMore to the point, neither Sununu nor election officials could point to any instances of Massachusetts residents being bused across the border to vote on election day. The one piece of evidence Sununu pointed to was an instance of staffers of a Democratic politician registering to vote at the politician\u2019s home -- but that practice was legal, and it did not involve Massachusetts residents being bused across the border en masse on Election Day.\nSununu\u2019s claim is ridiculous.
