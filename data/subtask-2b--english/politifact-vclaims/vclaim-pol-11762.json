It included an individual mandate, requiring almost all Massachusetts residents to get insurance, leading to an insured rate of nearly 98 percent in the state.\n\nIt required people who don't have health insurance to buy it or lose their individual state tax exemptions. To cover low-income people, private insurance companies developed low-cost plans that residents could buy through a new state-run insurance exchange called the Health Connector.\n\nBut the law doesn\u2019t address what is covered and what isn\u2019t. Search the text of it, and \"abortion\" is nowhere to be found.\n\n\"It doesn\u2019t say in the law what is covered or not. It talks about health care and funding health care,\" said Anne Fox, president of Massachusetts Citizens for Life, which opposes abortion.\n\nYes, abortion is covered\n\nA 1981 Supreme Judicial Court ruling in Massachusetts said that the cost of abortions had to be included in publicly subsidized plans.\n\nMost private insurance plans in the U.S. include abortion coverage, and the state-subsidized plans in Massachusetts do, too. So when the Health Connector began, abortion coverage was automatically included.\n\nIn some of the low-cost plans, abortions are covered with a $50 co-pay.\n\nSo Gingrich\u2019s ad is right that some abortions in Massachusetts are \"taxpayer-funded.\" But that requirement long predated the law Romney signed.\n\n\"That was already a given,\" Fox said. \"Anything that\u2019s paid for with tax money, like Medicaid, covered abortions.\"\n\nHer group was part of an effort to overturn that requirement with a constitutional amendment, but it failed.\n\n\"The combination of the court order and state-controlled health care means Romney really wasn\u2019t involved in funding these abortions. It was automatic, and there would be no way to stop it,\" Fox said. \"We tried. It would have to be a constitutional amendment. It would not be something somebody could just veto.\"\n\nFox\u2019s assessment lines up with that of an abortion-rights group we contacted:\n\n\"NARAL Pro-Choice America\u2019s position is that the Massachusetts health care plan enacted during former Gov. Romney\u2019s tenure expanded on a system that already covered abortion. Thus, Romney should not get credit for improving women's access to abortion in Massachusetts,\" spokesman Ted Miller said in an email.\n\nOur ruling\n\nGingrich\u2019s ad says \"Romney signed government-mandated health care with taxpayer-funded abortions.\"\n\nWhat\u2019s right about that? Romney did sign government-mandated health care, and Massachusetts does provide taxpayer-funded abortions. But the ad inaccurately links the two together. The law Romney signed did not mention abortion coverage. It was included by the state exchange, which created plans that mirror private insurance nationwide. And a court decision two decades earlier mandated that the cost of the abortions be included. You\u2019d never know any of that based on the misleading wording in the ad. We rate it Mostly False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H.
