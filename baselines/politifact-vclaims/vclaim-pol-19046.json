Then it must be time for conspiracy theories to flood social media timelines. Watch out.\nNo, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden does not have a medical device implanted in his skull that he turns on after reaching into his pocket so he can hear someone on the other end give him answers to questions. That\u2019s a bogus claim shared on Facebook ahead of the first presidential election debate between Biden and President Donald Trump.\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThere are a lot of false claims packed into the nearly 1,000-word post claiming to prove how Biden \"is cheating.\" The Sept. 28 post tries to build on Trump\u2019s narrative that Biden is mentally unfit to be president.\nPart of the post said:\n\"This is going to sound like something out of a science fiction movie but bear with me. This is totally real, and I\u2019ll prove it to you.\n\"Joe Biden has a medical device implanted in his skull.\n\"It\u2019s called the Esteem Hearing Implant which you can learn about HERE. It\u2019s an implant that goes into the skull above the ear and it has two micro-wire probes that are injected into the nerves inside the ear canal. It\u2019s FDA-approved and it uses bone conduction to enhance hearing (sound waves vibrate off the bones of the skull, and the wire probes send the signal directly into the ear, basically). It\u2019s wireless and it\u2019s controlled by the push of a button, so the user can turn it on and off with a little device\u2026 that fits in your pocket. And that\u2019s how the experts at Bombards Body Language spotted this trick. \u2026\u00a0\n\"When Joe Biden gets confused, he reaches into his pocket and turns on the implant. Whoever is talking to him on the other end instructs him to smile and then starts relaying answers to him until he gets back on track. Joe hears it because the implant receives a wireless signal and vibrates the bones in his skull.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe post does not offer any link to learn more, despite its suggestion that it has a source.\u00a0\nEnvoy Medical on Twitter Sept. 29 said that the claims about its hearing implant were inaccurate and that its device \"cannot secretly and wirelessly transmit conversations.\" The company said:\n\"There is a false story circulating on the internet and in social media that claims that Envoy Medical\u2019s Esteem Hearing Implant can be used to wirelessly transmit conversations or information into the ear.\n\"The Esteem Hearing Implant is not capable of this type of wireless communication and cannot be used in the manner described. The implant is a completely internal hearing device that improves the hearing of adults diagnosed with moderate to severe sensorineural hearing loss.\"\nBiden\u2019s campaign also refuted Trump campaign claims that Biden won\u2019t agree to an ear inspection and that Biden wanted multiple breaks during the 90-minute debate. \"Of course he\u2019s not wearing an earpiece and we never asked for breaks,\" Kate Bedingfield, Biden\u2019s deputy campaign manager and communications director, told reporters Sept. 29.\nIn December 2019, Biden\u2019s primary care physician, at Biden\u2019s request, issued a summary of his medical and surgical history. It did not mention any skull implant or hearing aid and said that his head, ears, eyes, nose and throat \"are normal.\"\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post claimed Biden has a medical device implanted in his skull so he can hear someone give him answers to questions.\nThat\u2019s a fabricated and baseless claim.\u00a0\nWe rate it Pants on Fire!\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections FactChat #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click here, for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19046"}
