If they don\u2019t get it, the house gets vandalized.\"\nBut we found no evidence to support that statement.\u00a0\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nAntifa describes a loose network of far-left anti-fascist groups that rally against white supremacy and other causes. It\u2019s a movement that goes back decades and its supporters have at times used violence.\u00a0\u00a0\nWe reached out to the Seattle Police Department about the Facebook post and did not hear back. But several neighborhood groups we contacted about the claim responded, and no one could corroborate it.\u00a0\nGina Hicks, president of Sustainable Capitol Hill, which describes itself as a network of neighbors, businesses and community groups trying to make the neighborhood sustainable, told PolitiFact there have been no such disturbances in the area. The neighborhood is the site of the Capital Hill Occupied Protest.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Wow, that\u2019s quite a claim!\" said Tom Heuser, president of the Capitol Hill Historical Society. \"I am not aware of any reports like this and I live in an apartment building that is one block north of the northern border of the zone.\"\n\"Ridiculous,\" said Gordon Padelford, executive director of Seattle Neighborhood Greenways. \"Haven\u2019t heard anything like that in Seattle.\"\nPhillip Tavel, vice president of the Morgan Junction Association, told us he thought he could \"safely say that antifa is not going door to door in Seattle threatening to vandalize houses that don\u2019t provide food and supplies.\" He said it hasn\u2019t happened in West Seattle, where the neighborhood association is located, nor has anyone he spoken to in other neighborhoods reported that kind of intimidation by antifa supporters.\u00a0\n\"Considering the network I have across the city, I would have heard if something like that was actually widespread,\" he added.\nRepresentatives of four other neighborhood groups in northeast Seattle echoed these sentiments.\u00a0\nAccording to news reports, some Seattle residents are certainly frustrated living near the Capitol Hill Organized Protest and have \"expressed concerns about their safety and security in an area that demonstrators want to be police-free,\" KING 5 News reported. But we didn\u2019t find any media coverage that lent credence to the Facebook post.\u00a0\nWe rate it False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17955"}
