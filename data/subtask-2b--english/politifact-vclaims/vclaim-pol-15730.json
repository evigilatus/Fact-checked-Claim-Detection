And what do the taxpayers get? They\u2019ll get stuck with up to a $50 billion tab for the taxpayer dollars Obama is using to pay for his takeover of GM.\"\n\n\nIn its bankruptcy filing, the company said it has $172.81 billion in debt and $82.29 billion in assets \u2014 all that despite a $20 billion General Motors has already received from the government, money that was initially earmarked for buying bad mortgages from banks.\n\n\nNow, the company will adopt a restructuring plan that is \"tailored to the realities of today's auto market,\" said Obama. It's \"a plan that positions GM to move toward profitability, even if it takes longer than expected for our economy to fully recover; and it's a plan that builds on GM's recent progress in making better cars.\"\n\n\nSo, there's no dispute that the government is invested in General Motors \u2014 it has already shelled out $20 billion in loans \u2014 but is Steele correct about the government's new financial ties to the ailing company?\n\n\nWe assume that by referring to President Obama owning 60 percent of the automaker, Steele means that the government as a whole will own that stake under the restructuring plan. In fact, the White House was the first to state this fact, during a May 31 briefing with reporters. By the administration's own words, the RNC is correct on this point.\n\n\nSteele goes on to say that Obama's \"union buddies will own almost 20 percent.\" To be exact, the United Auto Workers will get 17.5 percent of General Motor's common stock, plus cash to help pay for a $20 billion health care trust fund for retirees. Whether this is a boon to Obama's \"union buddies,\" as Steele's statement says, is a matter of opinion. However, it's worth noting that the UAW endorsed Obama for president and spent more than $4 million to assist his candidacy, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\n\nSo Steele is right that the administration will have a 60 percent ownership in the new General Motors and that the union will have nearly 20 percent. Steele earns a True.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H.
