(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nSo, that prompted us to dive in.\nAre the homeless somehow immune from the coronavirus?\nIn a word: No.\nHomeless populations more susceptible to virus\nHomelessness is a big problem across the country.\u00a0\nIn 2018, there were more than 552,000 people experiencing homelessness on a single night in America, according to the National Alliance to End Homelessness. In California alone, where this post originated, estimates show there are nearly 130,000 homeless people.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd, contrary to the Facebook claim, homeless shelters in cities across the country are dealing with outbreaks of the virus.\u00a0\nIn a study done by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in four cities -- Seattle, Boston, San Francisco and Atlanta -- out of 1,192 residents tested at shelters, 25% were positive. As for employees of the shelters, out of 313 people tested, 11% tested positive.\u00a0\nPeople experiencing homelessness are also more likely to have pre-existing health conditions, which also makes them higher risk, according to the CDC.\nFor instance, physical health problems, mental health problems and substance abuse issues -- or a combination of some or all of those -- can make it harder for the body to defend itself against the virus.\u00a0\nIn addition, because of the conditions those experiencing homelessness face -- from living in close quarters to being unable to readily wash hands -- they are at a higher risk, according to a fact sheet from the National Alliance to End Homelessness.\u00a0\nA COVID-19 factsheet from the group notes those over the age of 65 are more likely to become ill from the virus. Those who experience long-term homelessness tend to track the same health conditions as senior citizens, but at a younger age.\nIt can also be difficult for the homeless to maintain social distancing due to crowded shelters, according to an April 2, 2020 report from Wired.com. And when shelters reach their capacity, many are forced to sleep outside.\u00a0\nIn Milwaukee, those experiencing homelessness are able to take refuge at the Saint Francis de Sales Seminary, where 110 rooms were set up to isolate those with coronavirus symptoms from those who are at high risk of contracting the virus, according to a March 29, 2020 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel report. Plans called for those staying at the seminary to receive three meals a day and be checked on by members of the National Guard and the Milwaukee Health Department.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"Most places do not have easily accessible health care (for the homeless), and then there are people who for many reasons are not going to rush to speak to any authorities -- police, medical, social service, etc. -- because of issues like mental health, addiction, criminal background or just plain suspicion,\" said David Wagner, an emeritus professor of social work and sociology at the University of Southern Maine, in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin.\n\"I think that (COVID-19 infection) rates are generally going to be higher, if anything, among the homeless than the housed.\"\u00a0\nOur ruling\nA post making the rounds on Facebook claims homeless populations are immune to COVID-19.\nNot only is there no basis for this claim -- or claiming that any group has natural immunity to a virus that emerged just months ago -- the reality says otherwise.\nA CDC study of shelters in four major cities found that 25% of those tested were positive. In addition, tests of workers at the shelters came back with 11% positive.\nWe rate the claim Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18233"}
