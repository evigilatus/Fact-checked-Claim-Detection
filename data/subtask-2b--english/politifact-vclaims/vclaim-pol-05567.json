Terry McAuliffe says his two-year state budget proposal would bestow unprecedented riches on Virginia\u2019s public schools.\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, we are taking Virginia\u2019s investment in public education to the highest level in the commonwealth\u2019s history,\" he said on Dec. 17 as he introduced his budget to the General Assembly\u2019s money committees.\n\"We\u2019re not only setting a record in total state spending on education; we\u2019re also pushing up our per-pupil contribution to $5,446 in 2018,\" McAuliffe added. \"Again, this is the highest level of student support in our history.\"\nWe wondered whether the governor\u2019s budget truly would be a record breaker for public schools, which suffered deep state cuts during the most recent recession and have struggled for years to regain those funds.\nRaw dollars\nChristina Nuckols, McAuliffe\u2019s deputy press secretary, sent us a chart detailing total state aid for schools and per-pupil funding from 2001 through the current fiscal year, which ends June 30. The chart also carried forward those figures for each of the next two fiscal years in the governor\u2019s biennial budget proposal.\nIn raw dollars, McAuliffe\u2019s overall school budget would exceed the record $6.45 billion being spent during the current school year. lt would raise education spending to $6.54 billion next school year and to $6.82 billion during the 2017-18 term.\nMany of those new dollars, if matched by local school systems, would fund about 2,500 new instructional jobs over the biennium and a 2 percent pay raise for teachers in July 2017. \u00a0\nIn raw dollars, the governor\u2019s spending plan also would break the state record of funding $5,248 per student - set during the 2008-09 school year in the last budget that was approved before the recession decimated revenues. McAuliffe\u2019s budget would increase that level to $5,251 in 2016-17. The following school year, it would rise to $5,446.\nWhat about inflation?\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s a problem with comparing historic spending levels in terms of the raw money that was spent each year: A dollar spent today or in the future doesn\u2019t buy as much as a buck spent in the past. So we took a more meaningful look at whether McAuliffe's plan, when adjusted for inflation, would remain the richest school budget in Virginia history.\nThe governor\u2019s claim failed this test.\nWe adjusted each of the education budgets since 2001 to 2015 dollars, using inflation data published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Under these measurements, the high-water mark came in the 2008-09 school year, when the state spent an adjusted $6.96 billion on public education.\nThat figure exceeds the peak $6.83 billion expenditure - in raw dollars - in McAuliffe\u2019s 2017-18 budget. And the governor\u2019s outlay drops further in the rankings when it\u2019s adjusted for inflation.\nFinancial forecasters generally are predicting annual 2 percent inflation rates for the next few years. If that proves accurate, then the adjusted dollars in McAuliffe\u2019s peak education budget in 2017-18 would fall below the inflation-revised level of three state budgets that were in effect from July 2006 through June 2009.\nWe applied the same inflation adjustments to per-pupil spending, which is the gold standard in evaluating education budgets because it takes into account Virginia\u2019s rising enrollments.\nThe glory years for state spending per student once again occurred during the budgets that were in effect from July 2006 to June 2009. Virginia, in adjusted 2015 dollars, spent $5,524 to $5,825 per pupil during those school years. McAuliffe\u2019s peak proposal of $5,446 per student doesn\u2019t rise to that level in raw dollars and falls further when adjusted for inflation.\nOur ruling\n\"We are taking Virginia\u2019s investment in public education to the highest level in the commonwealth\u2019s history,\" McAuliffe said last month.\nIn raw dollars, the governor\u2019s proposed budget would set state records for overall education spending and per-student outlays. But this is a misleading way of comparing spending levels, because raw dollars lose value over time.\nA meaningful comparison of historic spending levels requires that the figures be adjusted for inflation. When that\u2019s done, the governor\u2019s education budget does not rise to the levels reached one to three years before the most recent recession.\nSo we rate the governor\u2019s claim Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05567"}
