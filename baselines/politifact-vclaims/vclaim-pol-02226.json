Robert Pittenger\u00a0greatly exaggerated\u00a0his opponent\u2019s short-lived opposition to Donald Trump before Trump became president. His opponent, Mark Harris,\u00a0falsely accused\u00a0Pittenger of being one of the most liberal Republicans in Congress.\nNow, Harris is criticizing Pittenger\u2019s vote on a recent spending bill.\n\"Robert Pittenger stood against funding for the border wall,\" Harris\u00a0posted on his Facebook page.\nThe post goes on to say that Pittenger and others \"left our President out on an island. The vote on the spending bill that funded almost every liberal priority from the left, did NOT include the money requested by our President to build the wall on the southern border.\"\n\nHarris is referring to a $1.3 trillion bill Congress passed on March 22 to fund the federal government and avoid a shutdown. The legislation, known as an omnibus bill, combines several issues into a single package.\nPolitiFact contacted the Harris campaign about their claim that Pittenger opposed funding for the border wall.\nHarris spokesman Jason Williams responded by email and referenced a March 2017 story where Pittenger is quoted saying he believes the wall is a\u00a0euphemism. That means he thinks Trump\u2019s use of the word \"wall\" alludes to broad efforts to secure the southern border \u2014 not necessarily a single barrier.\nWilliams also pointed to a March 21 article in\u00a0The Atlantic, in which anonymous sources are quoted saying that Trump is upset that the bill didn\u2019t fully fund the wall.\n\"There are a number of articles that report the President\u2019s dismay over lack of funding for the border wall,\" Williams wrote. \"There is some funding for some fencing and some border security, but not the actual construction of the wall itself.\"\nPittenger, for his part, said \"as Chairman of the Congressional Task Force on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare, I have always been in favor of building a wall and securing our porous southern border,\" he said in a statement.\n\"The FY2018 omnibus and earlier legislation I supported clearly provides funding to begin construction, and President Trump himself tweeted that \u2018much can be done with the $1.6 billion given to building and fixing the border wall.\u2019 Mark Harris cannot continue to have it both ways. Either he supports President Trump, as I have done consistently with a 97 percent pro-Trump voting record, or he doesn't. The facts are very clear.\"\nWhat the bill funds\nThe Harris campaign has a point about what the bill funds. As\u00a0PolitiFact recently noted, the bill provides funding for projects that improve or replace fencing, but doesn\u2019t fund any of the eight border wall prototypes ordered by the Trump administration.\nIn total, the omnibus bill includes $1.5 billion for physical barriers and \"associated technology\" along the southwest border, according to a\u00a0memo\u00a0from Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee.\n\"This amount provides for more than 90 miles of \u2018border wall system,\u2019 going beyond the administration\u2019s budget request for 74 miles\" this fiscal year, Frelinghuysen wrote in the memo.\nThe\u00a02,232-page document\u00a0specifies $251 million for 14 miles of \"secondary fencing\" along the southwest border near San Diego and a total of $641 million for border fencing near the Rio Grande Valley in Texas.\nEven more specifically, the bill funds 33 miles of barriers in Hidalgo and Starr counties, the\u00a0McAllen Monitor reported. In an interview with Fox News, House Speaker Paul Ryan elaborated on how the funding amount was determined.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJenna Wadsworth\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth Carolina Secretary of State Elaine Marshall \"has won more statewide races than probably anyone else alive.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Paul Specht \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Here is the deal on the border. We asked the border patrol: 'What do you need on the border?' What they tell us is, the conditions on the ground determine what kind of wall they want, different types in different places,\" Ryan said.\n\"For instance, they want concrete barrier with a fence on top, with earth behind it in the Rio Grande Valley so it doesn't get washed away in floods,\" he continued. \"In the desert they want a see-through wall, so they can see what is going on through it. So we do that.\"\n\nPittenger and the wall\nHarris\u2019 broader argument is that Pittenger stood against Trump by not funding the wall to a level that Trump desired.\nHowever, Pittenger has been one of Trump\u2019s most\u00a0consistent supporters.\nLast July, Pittenger voted for a $790 billion spending bill that would\u2019ve funded border security to the tune of $1.57 billion. (So did some of the\u00a0same Republican Congressmen\u00a0who described the recent bill\u2019s $1.6 billion in border funding as\u00a0too low)\nPittenger again aligned himself with Trump on immigration as recently as last October. He said the first step toward immigration reform is securing the border.\n\"This includes building a physical barrier along our porous southern border,\" Pittenger wrote in a column\u00a0published by TheCharlotteWeekly.com. \"Any attempt to fix immigration will fail without first stopping the flow of illegal immigrants.\"\nPittenger has a record of supporting Trump and Trump\u2019s agenda. So it\u2019s disingenuous to say that Pittenger \"stood against\" funding for a border wall simply because he supported a bill that doesn\u2019t fully fund the wall\u2019s full construction \u2013 a bill which Trump, himself, wavered on.\nTrump and the bill\nTrump\u2019s public stance on the bill wasn\u2019t consistent. On\u00a0March 21, Trump tweeted: \"Got $1.6 Billion to start Wall on Southern Border, rest will be forthcoming.\" Later the same day, he again\u00a0boasted on Twitter\u00a0that he \"had to fight for Military and start of Wall.\"\nThen, on March 23,\u00a0Trump tweeted\u00a0that he was considering vetoing the omnibus bill, \"based on the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded.\"\nAccording to Vox, Trump\u2019s demand for full-funding of the wall was a \"last minute\" request. The day before Trump tweeted his criticism of the bill, White House budget director Mick Mulvaney acknowledged that the administration didn\u2019t get everything it wanted in the bill.\nBut, Mulvaney said, the bill included \"more money than requested for technology and facilities\" and that the White House was generally happy with the immigration provisions.\n\"We asked for 74 miles worth of wall, we got 100,\" budget director\u00a0Mick Mulvaney told Fox News. \"Not exactly what we wanted, where we wanted. Congress chose to ignore some of the suggestions that [Customs and Border Protection] made on where the best kind of wall should go and that's unfortunate.\"\nTrump then signed the bill and promptly began\u00a0touting funding for the wall, saying construction would start immediately after signing the bill.\n\"We have a lot money coming to the border, and it will be coming over a period of time,\" Trump said. \"We funded the initial down payment of $1.6 billion. We\u2019re going to be starting work \u2013 literally \u2013 on Monday on not only some new wall ... but also fixing existing walls.\"\nOn\u00a0March 25, Trump tweeted, \"Much can be done with the $1.6 Billion given to building and fixing the border wall. It is just a down payment. Work will start immediately. The rest of the money will come - and remember DACA, the Democrats abandoned you (but we will not)!\"\nOur ruling\nHarris said Pittenger \"stood against funding for the border wall.\" Harris bases this claim on the idea that Trump wanted more money for the wall than Pittenger and other Republicans ultimately gave him. But just because Pittenger voted for a bill that doesn\u2019t fully fund the wall doesn\u2019t mean he stood against funding or doesn\u2019t support the idea. PolitiFact found no evidence that Pittenger worked to block wall funding, so we rate this claim False.\n Share the Facts 2018-04-05 16:40:53 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  Rep.
