The group collects economic statistics for all its members, including unemployment rates. We chose 20 countries for which data was available, including most of the countries in western Europe, plus Canada, Australia, Japan, South Korea, and Israel.\u00a0\nFor consistency\u2019s sake, we compared January to June because only two of the countries reported data for July.\u00a0\nAs the following chart shows, the United States was among the few countries to show a dramatic increase in the unemployment rate between January and June. The U.S. is the peach-colored line with the steep climb; you can see each country highlighted if you hover over the list of countries at the bottom.\n\nThe United States saw its unemployment rate increase from 3.6% to 11.1%. That works out to a little under 3.1 times higher in June than January.\nNo other country saw such a big increase.\u00a0\nThe only other nation that saw its unemployment rate more than double over that period was Canada, which saw its rate increase 2.2 times. Canada actually had a higher unemployment rate in June than the U.S. did, at 12.3%, but the scale of Canada\u2019s increase was more modest than the United States\u2019 because Canada had a higher rate to start, at 5.5%.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing U.S. data for February instead of January doesn\u2019t change the picture much. The U.S. unemployment rate in February was 3.5%, making the increase through June about 3.2 times.\nThere are a couple asterisks to Clinton\u2019s statement.\nIf you compare January to July, a month for which data isn\u2019t available for most of the OECD nations, the increase in the United States was still substantial, but just short of three times higher. The unemployment rate rose from 3.6% in January to 10.2% in July, meaning an increase of 2.8 times.\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that the U.S. unemployment rate has fallen for three straight months, amid a zigzagging reopening and a volatile economy. So the unemployment rate is likely to bounce around a bit before it settles down.\nFinally, the OECD itself notes some differences across countries. Some nations have used more aggressive efforts than the United States to subsidize workers to remain on payrolls. And some countries, such as the United Kingdom, do not count \"temporarily\" laid-off workers as unemployed, while the United States does count such workers as unemployed.\nOur ruling\nClinton said the United States is \"the only major industrial economy to have its unemployment rate triple\" since the coronavirus pandemic began.\nThat\u2019s accurate for the broadest comparison \u2014 a 20-nation selection of OECD nations between January 2020 and June 2020. The rate in the U.S. was 3.1 times higher in June than in January. Only Canada came close, with the unemployment rate 2.2 times higher over that period.\nHowever, extending the U.S. data to July showed that the increase fell slightly below three times, and there are some complications in making cross-country comparisons.\nWe rate the statement Mostly True.\nUPDATE, Aug. 20: This article has been updated with additional context about the complications of making cross-country comparisons of unemployment rates. The rating remains the same.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17140"}
