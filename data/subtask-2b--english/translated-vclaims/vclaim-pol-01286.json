But the accompanying picture is four years old. This article was referred to as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The United States representative Henry Koelar shared the original picture with the Houston Chronicle in 2014, along with a series of other photographs showing narrow and unhealthy conditions at the Customs and Border Protection Facility in South Texas. The allegation that immigrants bring infectious diseases is not new. We have verified some of the repetitions of the claim over the years. In 2014, a congressman said that migrants might bring Ebola across the United States-Mexico border. We've evaluated those pants on fire. In 2015, Donald Trump said, \"A massive infectious disease flows across borders.\" At that time, the health experts with whom we spoke agreed that there was no evidence of large numbers of cross-border casualties. More recently, other sites around immigrants have spread in the convoy to the United States-Mexico border, which is supposed to bring disease. There are no known reports of this case, according to The New York Times. The Facebook photo is from a specific test outbreak in 2014. The scabies are a treatable skin condition, but they can spread rapidly under crowded conditions. This prevalence has largely included migrants living nearby in detention centres. Only a small handful of border patrol personnel appear to have contracted it. There is some evidence that diseases cross the border between the United States and Mexico, but the CDC attributes the spread of diseases in that region not to illegal immigration but to legal return between the United States and Mexico. Our judgment has no evidence that undocumented immigrants to the United States carry deadly diseases. The disease is likely to spread from far greater numbers of legal cross-border transit and from the number of international travellers visiting other countries and returning to the United States. We value this allegation wrong.
