Bill targeted the last Raymundo television campaign announcement, in which she said she helped bring Naraganset beer from Iconah (\"Garna!\"). - Take Ganset to Road Island. In the announcement, Raimundo said: \"Now she's the best-selling beer ever,\" reiterating her claim that she helped create more than 1,000 jobs when she was a partner in her former company, Point Judith Capital. \"My campaign alone created more jobs in the state of Rhode Island than Naraganset Beera,\" said Bill on Tuesday, applause and laughter from the live television audience at the Providence Center for Theatre Arts. Paulette Fact Road Island recently researched Raimundo's claim \"over 1,000 jobs\" and his judgment is correct - in its narrow scope. Raymundo didn't claim that she created those jobs in Rhode Island -- although many people took that impression away. Is Bill's campaign more active than those who work in Naraganst beer? First, we checked with Bill's campaign manager, Devin Driscoll. Driscoll said the campaign had 40 employees. Driscoll included these posts in an e-mail: \"The Bell team has 30 field staff: three deputy field organizers; twenty-three field regulators; two regional field directors; and a deputy field manager (DFD) and a field manager.\" Driscoll said that field regulators were paid a start-up salary of $36,000 per year. He refused to list other salaries. \"We also have 10 staff members at Headquarters: Driver, Training Manager, Policy Manager, Digital Manager, GOTV Manager, Operations Manager, Scheduling Manager, Deputy Campaign Manager, Campaign Manager.\" \"All these 40 are full-time employees and are paid, with the exception of three employees of the Department of Finance, who are paid their salaries. Our financial staff receive a very competitive salary for regulators -- $36,000 a year, plus benefits (We provide health care through the World Health Assembly for all paid employees). On January 9, 2021, on Twitter, Sarah Goodlowski stated: \"Not all women lost jobs (in December's job report), most of them black and Latin women. In fact, white women got a job. \"By Nusiba Mizan \u2022 January 15, 2021 Driscoll said he started on January 1, and \"We started attaching field staff in May.\" The last workers joined the campaign in June. Driscoll, a consultant, said that the campaign also included a Director of Finance in Rhode Island. Three people left in the last two weeks to go to college or high school: a driver, a press assistant, our data manager, Driscoll said. To be fair, these functions are not permanent. If Bill becomes the next governor, it is fair to say that not all campaign personnel will join him in the State House. If Bill loses the election, Bill's team will be disbanded. Then we checked with Mark Helendrong, president of Naragansett Bera, which was fermented in Rhode Island from 1890 to 1983. In addition to himself, he said that there were six residents of Rhode Island and two residents of Massachusetts who worked full-time for the company in Rhode Island, for a total of nine. Four persons working full-time outside the state in sales and marketing. There were about 50 part-time staff working on promotion events throughout the East Coast; 20 of them lived and worked on Rhode Island. The company's headquarters are in Providence, but Helanderong said that beer is now fermented in Rochester, N.Y., Pokatak, Kon, Westport, Mass. The test payments were fermented locally in Rhode Island; ultimately, the company hopes to open a wine factory here. Our governor Clay Bell says that his campaign created \"more jobs in the state of Rhode Island than Naraganset Bera,\" a blow in Jenna Raimundo's claim that she helped bring Naragansett's beer to Rhode Island. Bill's campaign provided a list of 40 jobs in the campaign; Naraganst Beer said that it had 9 full-time staff in Rhode Island; 20 people working part-time at promotional events in Rhode Island; and four full-time staff outside the state. The main difference is that Bill &apos; s short-term functions and, in one way or another, most or all of them will disappear no later than November. Because the statement is accurate but needs further clarification or information, we are lifting a pint to Bill and often evaluating it right.
