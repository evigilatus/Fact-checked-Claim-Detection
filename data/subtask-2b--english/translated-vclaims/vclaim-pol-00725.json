It's a terrible thing, but I think the investigation and all the speculations that have occurred over the past two years have had a much more severe impact on our democracy than two Facebook ads.\" Kochner was eligible for his opinion on the impact, but his description of Russia &apos; s activity during the 2016 political season was wrong. \"Buying some Facebook ads to try to plant opposition\" is in stark contrast to the United States government's description of the Kremlin campaign \"active measures,\" which officials have concluded was carried out to help Trump and hurt Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. Russia sought to help Trump win the White House eventually, Muller did not prove an illegal relationship between the Trump campaign and Russia. But the idea that Moscow's efforts were like \"Fuse Facebook Declarations\" lies through the factual record compiled by Mueller, as well as the assessment of the intelligence community in the United States. Russia &apos; s campaign for effective measures included two major efforts. The first was a multi-platform social media campaign, which underestimated Kochner as buying Facebook ads. The second is the penetration and dissemination of democratic materials to jeopardize Clinton &apos; s electoral opportunities. \"The investigation proved that the Russian government envisaged that it would benefit from and secure the outcome of Tramp's presidency,\" M\u00f8ller's report. The M\u00f8ller result came after the United States intelligence community announced a similar conclusion after the 2016 vote. \"We also assessed Putin and the Russian Government have clearly favoured President-elect Trump,\" US January 2017 Intelligence Assessment. \"When Moscow seemed that Minister Clinton was likely to win the elections, the Russian influence campaign then focused on undermining its expected presidency.\" Russia's social media campaign. Russia's social media campaign has gone beyond Kouchner's claim of \"two Facebook ads.\" An entity supported by the Kremlin, the Internet Research Agency, or the Irish Republican Army, managed the social media campaign outside St. Petersburg, Russia. Mueller found that by the end of the US elections in 2016, \"the IRA was able to reach millions of American people through their social media accounts.\" The Irish Republican Army has purchased over 3,500 Facebook announcements and spent about $100,000 on political advertising, as the report states. The group also controlled several groups on Facebook and Instagram accounts that \"had hundreds of thousands of participants in the United States,\" as Mueller said. About a year after the election, an executive in Facebook said to Congress that the IRA controlled about 470 accounts, resulting in 80,000 positions between January 2015 and 2017. But the largest census is related to the length of its range. \"Fissebook estimated that the IRA had reached 126 million people through its Facebook accounts,\" says Muller's report. On January 18, 2021, in an interview with the right national radio program, \"China was behind intervention and effort to overthrow our government and elections, electoral fraud.\" By Daniel Funk \u2022 January 19, 2012, their effort in Facebook went far beyond that. In addition, the IRA controlled Twitter accounts with \"tens of thousands of followers,\" Mueller said, adding that among the followers were \"the many political figures in the United States that retweeted the content of the IRA.\" Twitter later revealed the control of the IRA over more than 3,800 accounts, and is likely to reach about 1.5 million Twitter users. Russia &apos; s hack and pass also ignored the description of the Russian intelligence operation to steal documents and release them. In order to help the prospects of Trump, Russian hackers controlled by the Russian Revolutionary Union and the Russian Military Intelligence Service stole e-mails belonging to democratic organizations and the leader of the Clinton campaign, John Bodessa, and transmitted them to several publishers, including WikiLeaks, concluded Muller. Two WikiLeaks wastes from the destroyed Clinton came at pivotal moments during the campaign. In late July 2016, Democrats chose Clinton as a presidential candidate at the National Democratic Congress. However, days before the nomination conference, a ceremony aimed at strengthening party unity, WikiLeaks began publishing stolen e-mails from the Democratic Party. The first tranche - about 20,000 e-mails - revealed an embarrassing overview of the internal deliberations between the National Democratic Commission. The correspondence appears to show that the party apparatus conspires to promote Clinton and undermine its competitor, Bernie Sanders. These e-mails triggered the democratic internal fighting just as the party sought to pool support for Clinton. The month before the election on October 7th. That afternoon, the Washington Post published a video of an interview in 2005 with Access Holody, where Trump boasts that his celebrity position enabled him to touch women. Less than an hour after the Trump tape appeared publicly, WikiLeaks revealed that he had received 50,000 e-mails from Bodista. An initial prank was issued for some 2,000 letters from the Clinton campaign leader. The timing of Bodista's e-mail release raised doubts that WikiLeaks wanted to distract him from Hollywood news. Almost all the findings of the Mueller report on WikiLeaks &apos; role have been revised. Our Governor Kouchner said that Russia's intervention in the 2016 elections was a \"fiscal announcement.\" This allegation is highly offensive to describe Russia &apos; s campaign of active measures, which included both social media efforts to help Trump run for office and the hacking and jumping process aimed at hindering the electoral opportunities of Democrats. Specifically on Facebook, the technology company estimates that the Kremlin-controlled accounts reached 126 million people around the elections. We value these pants on fire.
