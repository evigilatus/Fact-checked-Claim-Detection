David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s Move!\n\nWe asked Romney\u2019s campaign, and did some searching of our own.\n\nThe first lady didn\u2019t offer a blanket endorsement of Bright Horizons, a major provider of employer-sponsored child care that\u2019s been named one of Fortune magazine\u2019s \"100 Best Companies to Work for in America.\"\n\nRather, she singled them out for a mention in a June 2011 speech in Washington, D.C., as a new partner for her healthy-kids initiative, Let\u2019s Move.\n\nHer comments were publicized a year later in a Daily Caller article headlined \"Michelle Obama praised Bain Capital-backed child care company,\" as well as by ABC News and Fox Business News with Neil Cavuto.\n\nShe was \"singing the praises of a company called Bright Horizons last year\" saying it was \"it was beyond just first-rate,\" Cavuto said.\n\nThe coverage focused on a YouTube video that showed the first lady mentioning Bright Horizons . She had visited a child care center \u2014 not one managed by Bright Horizons, but rather an unrelated center called CentroNia \u2014 to announce \"Let\u2019s Move Child Care.\" Providers such as Bright Horizons had agreed to sign on with Partnership for a Healthier America to focus on nutrition and exercise in their centers.\n\nMichelle Obama said:\n\n\"The Partnership for a Healthier America is working with private providers like Bright Horizons. That\u2019s the nation\u2019s second largest private child care provider, and they\u2019re going to implement this checklist at nearly 600 child care centers across the country. So we already have commitments that are going to affect hundreds of thousands of children today. Again, that\u2019s why we\u2019re excited to be able to launch this. That's why these partners here today are so important, because we wouldn't have this announcement if we didn't have the folks ready to step up and invest and get the ball rolling and be the models, as CentroNia is, to show that we can do this, and it can work.\"\n\nIn a related Bright Horizons news release, she was quoted as saying, \"If our kids get into the habit of getting up and playing, if their palates warm up to veggies at an early age, and if they\u2019re not glued to a TV screen all day, they\u2019re on their way to healthy habits for life. That\u2019s why I\u2019m so excited about Let\u2019s Move Child Care \u2013 because I know that childcare facilities and home-based providers can be a real building block for an entire generation of healthy kids.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nRomney said the first lady \"praised\" Bright Horizons. She did say that she was \"excited\" to launch an initiative that included the child care provider, calling Let\u2019s Move partners \"so important.\" Those are favorable comments about the company.
