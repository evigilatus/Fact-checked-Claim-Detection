Scott Walker and GOP lawmakers wound up reducing the system\u2019s budget increase.\nAs a result, when Kooyenga talks accounting at the Capitol, people listen.\nEven when -- perhaps especially when -- he\u2019s commenting on something as dry as Wisconsin\u2019s poor national ranking on budget deficits as measured by \"generally accepted accounting principles.\"\nThose principles, known as GAAP for short, are a core issue when it comes to how state government spends tax dollars.\nKooyenga says adopting the principles would rule out \"games,\" \"deceptive accounting practices\" and \"gimmicks\" that hold back the state\u2019s credit rating and enable lawmakers to saddle future generations with unsustainable financial obligations.\nOn Sept. 18, 2013, Kooyenga cited GAAP after hearing a state investment board official laud the fully-funded status of the state pension fund in testimony before the Legislature\u2019s Joint Committee on Finance.\n\"Before we applaud ourselves, there\u2019s a reason that Wisconsin has a 100 percent \u00a0funded pension system but we have the fourth-highest GAAP deficit in the country,\" Kooyenga said, mentioning a couple of the aforementioned accounting gimmicks. \"So I hope we can work on that over time -- which we have.\"\nHe concluded: \"We\u2019ve used GAAP accounting here in this building the last two years.\"\nThat last phrase is worth checking, because the back-and-forth over budgets is heating up as we approach the 2014 gubernatorial race.\nGov. Scott Walker actually campaigned on GAAP as an issue in 2010, contending that then-Gov. Jim Doyle had falsely claimed the state\u2019s budget was balanced. He promised to balance the budget not only by the usual Madison standard, but also under the GAAP scorecard -- and to do it in every budget, just as local units of government do.\nState lawyers long ago said the constitutional requirement to balance the state budget could be done mostly on a simple cash basis -- not the accrual method called for by GAAP.\nAnd that\u2019s been just fine with the political set in Madison.\nWhy?\nLawmakers and the governor would have to cut $2 billion to $3 billion more from the budget to fully balance under the more stringent GAAP standards. That $2 billion to $3 billion represents the \"GAAP deficit.\" And it\u2019s been in that range most years since 2002.\nSo, how has GAAP been applied in recent years?\nTalk of change aside, the fact remains that neither party and no governor -- including Walker -- has balanced the budget without a GAAP deficit since the state started tracking it in 1990.\nWe gave Walker a Promise Broken when his first proposed budget (2011-\u201913) not only left a GAAP deficit intact, but increased the size of it, to $3 billion. The governor\u2019s second budget (2013-\u201915) went even further the other way, estimating a 29 percent increase in that deficit.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThose facts put Kooyenga\u2019s claim into a hole right off the bat.\nNeither budget was prepared using GAAP or balanced by those principles. And Kooyenga supported both budgets.\nKooyenga\u2019s case\nWe spoke with Kooyenga and checked the long history of GAAP deficits and found an element of truth in his claim, which is vague enough to leave it open to some interpretation.\nKooyenga referred to the \"last two years,\" 2011 and 2012. That coincides with his first two years in office and with Walker\u2019s first two-year budget.\nLooking just at the final adopted version of that budget, it turns out that some tangible GAAP progress was made. That\u2019s mainly because after Walker submitted his spending plan, a new revenue estimate gave lawmakers another $600 million to play with.\nLawmakers chose to use a big chunk of the windfall to pay some big bills left behind from Doyle\u2019s days -- a move that cut significantly into the GAAP deficit.\nWe now know, based on actual results, that the first year of that budget (2011-\u201912) saw nearly an $800 million drop in the size of the GAAP deficit. It was the first drop in eight years, though it still left a long ways to go to be fully balanced under GAAP.\nAs for year two, we won\u2019t know the results until the books are closed on 2013. But experienced forecasters in the independent Legislative Fiscal Bureau and at the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance say the GAAP deficit is very likely to shrink again.\nWalker and his Republican legislative allies have rejuvenated the state\u2019s rainy day fund, and fund balances are running well into the black, both of which are positive factors in driving down the GAAP number.\nThat, Kooyenga told us, is in part what he was referring to when he said \"we\u2019ve used GAAP.\"\nThe \"we\" in his statement, he said, refers also to the CPA Caucus.\nThat caucus has publicly tracked and reported how budget decisions look under GAAP. And Kooyenga went door to door in the Assembly to get bipartisan support for a constitutional amendment requiring the use of GAAP principles. That measure passed the Assembly in 2012 but died in the Senate.\nStill, the state continues to use accounting maneuvers such as manipulating the timing of huge aid payments to local governments and schools into future fiscal years. Such moves help elected officials balance the budget on paper -- but run afoul of GAAP.\nThose maneuvers were in the final version of the 2011-13 budget.\nOur rating\nKooyenga said \"We\u2019ve used (generally accepted accounting principles) here in this building the last two years.\"\nState officials, including Kooyenga and his caucus, have partially \"used\" significant moves to improve the GAAP deficit picture, and they have increased public awareness of it.\nBut those principles certainly haven\u2019t been fully put to use; not even close. Most of the GAAP deficit remained after those two years. And left unmentioned by Kooyenga is that much of the progress in decreasing it is projected to be reversed in fiscal 2014 and 2015.\nWe rate his claim Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08854"}
