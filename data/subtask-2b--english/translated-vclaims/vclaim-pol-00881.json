In a recent discussion with its competitor, Laurie Lightfoot, in front of the editorial board of the Chicago Tribune, the candidates were asked about the increasing pressures of speculation and the shrinking supply of affordable housing in Chicago. When she explained how she would attack the problem, Brequinkel criticized a city-run programme aimed in part at increasing the supply of affordable housing in better-off neighbourhoods with high rents. The programme requires the developers of new housing projects either to allocate a share of the units at prices below market prices or to pay in a special fund to support lower-priced housing elsewhere. \"ARO's expensive requirements decree - it is a real challenge because, I understand, in the past 12 years, despite the enormous amounts of money I have gone to, only 400 family units have been established. Four hundred in 12 years, he said, \"Brequenkle.\" \"It is clear that 400 family units in 12 years are not a success.\" The Office did not face any shortage of cash from affordable housing advocates who wondered whether it was so full of gaps that it could not be effective. However, the number of 400 units thrown out by Brequinkel seemed too low. So we decided to check her accounts. The housing built by developers has passed through the office several times over the years, but today it applies to developers of residential buildings with 10 or more units who want to build downtown or ask the city to change the division of areas, land or financial support. These developers must offer 10 per cent of the total number of units on their project at prices below market prices, or instead provide less than 10 per cent, and pay a unit fee to compensate for the shortfall. Daniel Hertz, a housing expert at the Chicago Centre for Fiscal and Budgetary Accountability, said that policies such as the Asian Regional Office could help address apartheid and economics, but faced inherent constraints in producing a large amount of affordable units. Hertz said: \"It is a policy that has the special advantage of putting affordable units in higher income neighbourhoods.\" \"But it will never achieve the magnitude of the problem (housing shortage) in Chicago or elsewhere.\" However, Brequinkel &apos; s claim significantly reduces the modest number of units in new projects that UNOPS has requested developers to provide at lower prices. According to the city &apos; s Ministry of Planning and Development, from 2008 to September 2018, developers agreed to include approximately 800 affordable units in projects that had been built or were still under way. Chris Kennedy mentioned on January 16, 2018, in an interview with the Chicago Sun Times, \"no need to be placed in affordable housing.\" \u2022 6 February 2018, when we asked the Proquinkel campaign for its source, a spokesman sent a letter to the editor of the Chicago Sun Times from a local housing group manager stating an electronic list of affordable housing developments presented by the city as a tool for potential tenants. But Justin Rot, the coordinator of the comprehensive housing project in the department, told us that the list was incomplete. He said: \"It gives you a good idea of what is available but not necessarily in real time and not necessarily the full amount of projects that have appeared online and that have or still have units available.\" Housing supported by ARO BRIKINKL boxes criticizes ARO performance is also missing the mark in another way. The Ministry's records show that the Affordable Housing Fund has received more than $158 million since the programme began in 2003, and that a large part of it has come since 2007. Brequinkel complained that a large sum had created a bunch of units. What she has not explained is that these funds are distributed to promote affordable housing in different ways, beyond what private developers themselves spend to offer a share of the units they build at affordable prices. For example, in the past year only ARO funds were used to secure rental subsidies in more than 1,400 units for residents who receive less than 30 per cent of the average income in the region, as the records of the Section show. Experts said that although these funds are not spent in ways that would diversify housing in more visible parts of the city, other programmes they support are crucial in helping low-income city residents to obtain affordable housing. \"This program is not the main way in which the city creates affordable housing,\" said Rachel Johnston of the Chicago Rehab Network. \"Despite the enormous amounts of money that went to this, only 400 family units have been established\" said our Governor Brequinkel in the past 12 years through the Law on Affordable Requirements in Chicago. The city records show that developers have either promised or produced approximately 800 units under ARO so far. This does not go too far towards the programme's goal of creating more expensive housing in more volatile areas of the city or closing the affordable housing gap in the city, so there is some truth in the broader argument put forward by Brequinkel. But its number 400 is far from credible. Its claim also ignores how millions of dollars of fees collected from developers who chose not to build units at affordable prices under the decree support rental subsidies and other affordable housing programmes throughout the city. We mostly rate it wrong. In fact, this statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that give a different impression.
