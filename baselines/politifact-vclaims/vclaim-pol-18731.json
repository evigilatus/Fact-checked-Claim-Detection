Facebook and cable news have gone further to suggest new and unsupported theories about what\u2019s on the hard drive.\nOne text post says, \"Hunter Biden had 25,000 pics of him torturing and raping children under age 10 in China on his laptop!\"\u00a0\nClaims like this were amplified by websites like Natural News and InfoWars. Facebook has long banned the sites for posting anti-vaccine misinformation and hate speech, but we found one InfoWars video on Facebook with more than 173,000 views. It claims Trump \"has footage of Hunter Biden raping and torturing little girls.\"\nThese posts were flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Similar posts have been shared tens of thousands of times, according to CrowdTangle, a social media insights tool.\u00a0\nWe can\u2019t say for certain what is or isn\u2019t on a hard drive. But there is no evidence to support allegations that it contains thousands of images of Hunter Biden abusing children in China.\n\n(Screenshot from Facebook)\nThe unproven claim has roots on a fringe internet forum that\u2019s a known source of online disinformation, 4chan.\nOn Oct. 15, Chanel Rion, the chief White House correspondent for One America News Network \u2014\u00a0a pro-Trump cable TV network \u2014\u00a0tweeted that she had seen the contents of the hard drive at the center of the New York Post story.\n\"Drugs, underage obsessions, power deals,\" she said in the post. \"Druggie Hunter makes Anthony Weiner's down under selfie addiction look normal.\"\nThe tweet, which was shared more than 53,000 times, then made its way to 4chan, where users anonymously speculated that it meant the FBI was investigating Hunter Biden. One user posing as Rion affirmed that speculation, saying the hard drive contained child pornography.\nThe real Rion tweeted Oct. 16 that she did not write the posts.\u00a0\n\"For the record: I do not post on chat forums,\" she wrote. \"I understand there are hoaxers posing as me.\"\nBut it was too late. Social media users dedicated to QAnon, a baseless conspiracy theory that claims Trump is secretly fighting a cabal of Satan-worshipping, cannibalistic, left-leaning pedophiles, took the 4chan posts as evidence that the FBI was investigating Hunter Biden for potentially possessing child pornography.\u00a0\nBy Sunday, the conspiracy theory had made its way to Fox News. \"Sunday Morning Futures\" host Maria Bartiromo noted that a name written on the back of a federal subpoena included in the Post\u2019s story appears to belong to Joshua Wilson, an FBI agent who has worked on child pornography cases.\u00a0\n\"Connect the dots: If an FBI agent is working on child pornography issues for five years, why is he subpoenaing the laptop of Hunter Biden? Is there a connection here?\" Bartiromo asked Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis.\nJohnson did not give a direct answer. \"Well, I think you just made the connection,\" he said. \"Again, this is what the FBI, I think, has to come clean about.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLater that day, a tweet from Wayne Allyn Root, a conservative radio host who has pushed false claims about former President Barack Obama\u2019s birthplace and the identity of the 2017 Las Vegas shooter, claimed to have breaking news.\n\"My sources-as high up as it gets- watched videos on Hunter\u2019s laptops TODAY. Just told me point blank...no rumor...they saw Hunter raping & torturing little Chinese children,\" he tweeted.\nWhen asked in an email for evidence to support his claims aside from anonymous sources, Root did not provide any.\nConcerns about the New York Post story\nThere\u2019s a lot we still don\u2019t know about the hard drive at the center of the New York Post coverage.\u00a0\nThe story about Joe Biden and a Ukraine meeting relies on information from a computer hard drive that the tabloid said it received from Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani. The computer was supposedly left unclaimed at a Delaware computer shop, the owner of which called the FBI and a Giuliani associate after noticing a sticker for the Beau Biden Foundation on the laptop. The emails cited in the Post\u2019s article, which we are not able to verify, do not establish that a meeting between the elder Biden and a Ukrainian businessman ever occurred.\u00a0\nNowhere in the Post\u2019s story is Hunter Biden linked to child pornography. We reached out to the FBI for more information, but it declined to comment due to its practice of \"neither confirming nor denying the existence of an investigation.\"\nRELATED: Looking at claims about Hunter Biden, and the Senate GOP report that helped fuel them\nRemember these points as you see claims about the laptop and stories around it.\n\n\nIt's unclear if the name on the back of the subpoena actually belongs to Joshua Wilson, or if there\u2019s more than one FBI agent who goes by that name. It\u2019s also unconfirmed if the subpoena in the Post\u2019s story was for the laptop.\n\n\nFederal investigators are looking into whether emails found on the laptop could be linked to a foreign intelligence operation to discredit Joe Biden. (More than 50 former intelligence officials told Politico they appear to be. Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe says they\u2019re not.)\n\n\nStaffers at the Post expressed concerns about the story\u2019s credibility before it was published. Fox News passed on the story until the emails could be properly vetted.\n\n\nThe owner of the computer repair shop told reporters that, while he couldn\u2019t confirm it was Hunter Biden who dropped off the laptop because he is \"legally blind,\" he also said he didn't see child pornography on the computer.\n\n\nNo other news organizations have seen or corroborated the data supposedly on the laptop's hard drive.\u00a0\nWe reached out to the Biden campaign for a comment, but we haven\u2019t heard back.\nOur ruling\nSeveral Facebook posts claim \"Hunter Biden had 25,000 pics of him torturing and raping children under age 10 in China on his laptop.\"\nThere is no evidence to support that.\u00a0\nThe allegation originated on an anonymous internet forum that\u2019s a known source of online disinformation, and conspiracy websites that reported the claims relied on anonymous sources to back them up. The New York Post\u2019s story about Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop is unconfirmed \u2014 but it also does not mention child pornography. The owner of the computer repair shop where the laptop came from told reporters he didn\u2019t see child pornography on it.\nWithout information to support the allegations, we rate the posts False.\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections FactChat #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click here for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18731"}
