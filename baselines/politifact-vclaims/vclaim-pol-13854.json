I\u2019m sorry, you\u2019re breaking up. Can you find a stronger signal and say that again?\n\nLarson wrote the post five days after LaHood appeared on the MSNBC show Morning Joe on Nov. 16, 2010. On the show, LaHood talked about the dangers of distracted driving and how cell phones, smart phones, iPods and other devices have become major contributors to the problem. During the conversation, LaHood was asked about \"slamming\" technology that would render cell phones useless.\n\n\"Simply banning talking on a cell phone behind the wheel is not enough for him,\" Larson wrote. \"He\u2019s on MSNBC saying, \u2018I think it will be done. Scrambling technology is there and I think you are going to see the technology become adaptable to disable cell phones. We need to do a lot more if we are going to save lives.\u2019\"\n\n\"Ready for Nanny State LaHood to be driving behind the wheel with you? He\u2019s not only telling you that you can\u2019t use your cell phone but he\u2019s going to disable it so that it won\u2019t work,\" Larson wrote.\n\nLarson wasn\u2019t alone in this charge. A large group of mostly conservative commentators constructed an assortment of conspiracy theories after hearing LaHood.\n\nHere\u2019s the exchange on Morning Joe that touched it off:\n\u00a0\nCo-host Mika Brzezinski: \"So, Secretary, everything you said is true. Everybody does it, everybody\u2019s on the phone. If you look around my neighborhood, all the moms are trying to pick up kids, they\u2019re on their phones, they\u2019re trying to pick up other kids, it happens. Isn\u2019t the only way to stop this, is to have a device in the car, when that car is on, a \u2018slammer.\u2019 Literally, the \u2018phone slammer\u2019 starts and phones don\u2019t work. Isn\u2019t that the only way to stop it?\"\nSecretary LaHood: \"There\u2019s a lot of technology out there now that can disable phones and we\u2019re looking at that. A number of them [cell technology innovators] came to our Distracted Driving Summit here in Washington and presented their technology, and that\u2019s one way. But you have to have good laws, you have to have good enforcement, and you have to have people take personal responsibility. That\u2019s the bottom line.\"\nLaHood\u2019s comments admittedly left room for interpretation and confusion, sort of like talking to someone with a weak signal and hearing every third word.\nLaHood and his aides apparently realized this, too. Two days later LaHood clarified his comments on the department\u2019s blog.\n\"Again, personal responsibility \u2013 that\u2019s the bottom line,\" LaHood wrote in a Nov. 18, 2010, entry titled \"Setting the Record Straight\" on Fast Lane, \"the official blog of the U.S. Secretary of Transportation.\"\n\"When you get behind the wheel of a 5,000 pound automobile, you have a personal responsibility to drive that vehicle safely. That means, put away cell phones and other devices that take your focus off of the road.\"\nTiming is important, however.\nThe clarification came three days before Larson\u2019s entry on OregonCatalyst.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIgnored in the jousting is this central -- and unchallenged -- fact: Distracted driving is a major threat to safety. It\u2019s also beyond question that young and inexperienced drivers are especially at risk.\nHere are some facts:\n\nIn 2008, almost 20 percent of all crashes involved some type of distraction. (Source: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration - NHTSA).\nNearly 6,000 people died in 2008 in crashes involving a distracted driver, and more than half a million were injured. (NHTSA)\nThe younger, inexperienced drivers under 20 years old have the highest proportion of distraction-related fatal crashes.\nDrivers who use hand-held devices are four times as likely to get into crashes serious enough to injure themselves. (Source: Insurance Institute for Highway Safety)\nUsing a cell phone while driving, whether it\u2019s hand-held or hands-free, delays a driver's reactions as much as having a blood alcohol concentration at the legal limit of 0.08 percent. (Source: University of Utah)\n\n\nGiven that reality, LaHood says, his department is always on the lookout for new approaches and technology to minimize the danger. Some of those technologies are being studied by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\nBanning cell phone use in cars by way of \"slamming technology\" is not on the list and will not be considered, LaHood and his aides say.\nThat leads to an obvious question. \"Some have asked why NHTSA would research this kind of technology if there was no intent to put it into use,\" Department of Transportation press secretary Olivia Alair said in an e-mail exchange.\n\"The reality is, many independent researchers and innovators have approached the DOT with technologies they\u2019ve designed to prevent distracted driving. NHTSA needs to evaluate these kinds of technologies in large part because they may one day wind up on the market \u2013 geared towards parents who want to install them in their teens\u2019 cars for example \u2013 and it\u2019s important for NHTSA to know how they work, whether they are safe, and whether they help or hurt efforts to stop distracted driving.\"\nBut, she adds, \"We have never promoted the use of technologies to disable cell phone signals, nor have we ever indicated we intended to require them.\"\nLarson could be forgiven for jumping to the wrong conclusion if his comments appeared the same day LaHood spoke -- or even the \u00a0next day. But saying the federal government is moving to cripple your phone three days after the record was clarified to the contrary is dubious no matter how well your smart phone is working. For that reason, we rate his claim False.\nComment on this item.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13854"}
