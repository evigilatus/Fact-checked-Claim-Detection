During the debate on the proposal in the Senate, democratic legislators proposed amendments that would exempt spending on health care related to non-abortion such as sexually transmitted diseases or health crises such as the outbreak of Zeka disease. Donna Campbell, the billwriter, urged her colleagues to reject changes and said that no amount of taxpayers' dollars should go to an abortion entity. \"When we talk about health, there's nothing healthy about abortion,\" said Campbell, a Republican from New Brownville. \"To the industry in Texas alone, nearly 60,000 innocent children a year are aborted, when we try to put things in perspective and you talk about healthy practices, We were curious about Campbell's abortion statistics. The number of abortions performed annually in Texas is declining, as the State has tightened its restrictions. What do the last numbers tell us? According to Alice Claybourne, Campbell's spokesman, this issue came from reports published by the State Committee for Health and Human Services on abortion providers in Texas. These reports are compiled using data reported by the State from abortion facilities, hospitals, mobile surgery centres and doctor &apos; s offices. In 2016, 54,507 abortions were performed in Texas, including 1,026 cases of non-state patients, according to state-of-the-art figures. At least 200 of these actions took place in hospitals or doctor &apos; s offices that will be exempted from Campbell &apos; s legislation. The draft law applies to all abortion clinics and any mobile surgical centres or medical offices that perform more than 50 abortions in a given year. There are 26 facilities in Texas, including clinics and surgical centres, that perform abortions, according to a list provided by the National Anti-Abortion Fund (NARAL Pro-Choice Texas) and the Lilith Fund, which helps low-income patients pay for abortion. The Texas Act prohibits 20 weeks of abortions after vaccination (with certain exceptions) and requires that any abortions be performed after vaccination for more than 16 weeks in a hospital or surgical emergency centre, according to the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas. In one of his interviews on 31 January 2021, John Kerry says that Hurricane Harvey \"has dropped water in Houston in five days more than in Niagara Falls in one year.\" By Brandon Mulder on 5 February 2021, Austin's contract with Family Planning, where the organization rents a city-owned building to a health centre for $1 a year, will be terminated. State data show a decrease in abortions, and the number of abortions performed in Texas has declined significantly since 2001, the year in which the Health and Human Services Commission published the most recent data. The number ranged from 77,000 to 75,000 between 2001 and 2005, before rising to 82,000 in 2006. Since 2008, the number of abortions performed in the state has decreased almost every year. At the national level, the number of abortions performed annually tends to increase following major judicial decisions that remove restrictions on abortion and then begin to decline, according to a previous report by the Polyte Fak Texas Foundation on the number of proceedings. Legislation aimed at restricting the possibility of abortion is often passed by Texas legislators. In 2013, the legislator passed a law requiring all abortion facilities to meet the standards of mobile surgical centres and that doctors performing abortions there receive admission privileges in a hospital within 30 miles. The Supreme Court eventually repealed the key provisions of the Act in 2016, but not before close to 20 abortion clinics, leaving only 18 open clinics, according to research carried out in the Texas Policy Assessment Project at Ut University. By 2019, the number of facilities providing abortion services had increased again to 26. With regard to Campbell &apos; s larger point on whether abortion is linked to health care, studies published by the Texas Policy Assessment Project have shown that the closure of clinics affects the number of actions implemented but also limits access to general gynaecology and reproductive health care, as stated by Carrie White, an investigator in the policy cluster. \"Our work has proved that these various measures have had negative effects on women's health,\" Wyatt said, noting that closure means \"women have not been able to access the reproductive care they need.\" Our classification, Campbell, said that the abortion industry does 60,000 operations a year in Texas. In 2016, more than 54,000 abortions were performed in Texas. It was not the service providers who would be subject to the Campbell proposal that carried out all of these procedures. We're mostly assessing this claim right. In fact, this statement is accurate but requires further clarification or information.
