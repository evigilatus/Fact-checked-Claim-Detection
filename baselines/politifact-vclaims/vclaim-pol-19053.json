But this post is wrong on another point. The men in the photos were accused of killing law enforcement officers in 2016, not 2020.\u00a0\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nWe did a reverse image search for each of the photos that appear in the grid.\u00a0\nThe man in the first photo, Herschel R. Jones III, was accused of shooting and killing a police officer in Danville, Ohio, in January 2016. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life in prison.\u00a0\nMoving right to left, top to bottom, the man in the second photo is Corey Lee Henderson, who was shot and killed by police in Holladay, Utah, after police said Henderson shot and killed a police officer in January 2016.\u00a0\nThe third photo shows Phillip Ferry, who was accused of fatally shooting an officer in Seaside, Oregon, in February 2016. Another officer shot and killed him.\nThe fourth photo shows Austin Holzer, who was 17 when he was charged with first-degree murder in the fatal February 2016 shooting of a sheriff\u2019s deputy in Mesa County, Colorado. He pleaded guilty.\u00a0\nThe fifth photo shows David Brian Evans, who shot and killed two deputies in Harford County, Md., before he was killed by deputies who returned fire in February 2016.\nThe sixth photo shows Marcus Schumacher, who authorities said shot and killed a police officer in Fargo, N.D., before he turned the gun on himself in February 2016.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe seventh photo shows Charles Lee Lambert, who shot and killed a state trooper in Mississippi in February 2016 and was then killed by other officers.\u00a0\nThe eighth photo shows Martin Wirth, who shot and killed an officer in Bailey, Colo., before officers shot and killed him in February 2016.\nThe ninth photo shows Evan Dorsey, who police said shot and killed an Indiana sheriff\u2019s deputy before killing himself in March 2016.\nThe 10th photo shows Lincoln Rutledge, who was accused of killing an Ohio police officer who was part of a SWAT team trying to arrest Rutledge for allegedly setting fire to his estranged wife\u2019s house in April 2016. He was sentenced to life in prison.\u00a0\nThe 11th photo shows Joseph Moreno, who was accused of killing an officer in Alamogordo, N.M., in September 2016. Police shot and killed Moreno.\u00a0\nThe 12th photo shows Trenton Forster, who was charged with murder in the October 2016 death of a St. Louis County officer in Missouri. He was sentenced to life in prison.\u00a0\nThe 13th photo shows John Hernandez Felix, who was sentenced to death in the October 2016 killing of two police officers in Palm Springs, Calif.\nThe 14th photo shows Ralph Stanley Elrod Jr., who was charged with murder in the deaths of two sheriff\u2019s deputies in Peach County, Ga., in November 2016. He pleaded guilty and received two life sentences.\nThe 15th photo shows Larry Darnell Gordon, who authorities said was trying to escape from a courthouse in Michigan when he took a gun from an officer and killed two bailiffs before he was fatally shot by other officers in July 2016.\u00a0\nThe 16th photo shows Jesse Denver Hanes, who was accused of killing a police officer in New Mexico in August 2016. He was sentenced to life in prison.\nIt\u2019s unclear what the Facebook post meant when it asked about the grid: \"Anyone notice anything strange?\"\nMany of the people featured in the image who were accused of killing officers were themselves shot and killed at the scene by police. Lead Stories, which also looked into this claim, also noted that other officers were killed that year by suspects including men of different ethnicities.\nThe post claims that the photos show \"all the men\" who killed police officers this year. It\u2019s true that the people in the images were accused of killing law enforcement officers.\u00a0But that was in 2016, not 2020. And more than 16 people were accused of killing police that year. According to the FBI, 118 law enforcement officers were killed in line-of-duty incidents in 2016, including 66 law enforcement officers who died as a result of criminal acts.\nWe rate this post Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19053"}
