At the same time, he's derided Democratic nominee Barack Obama for taking no similar stand.\n\n\nMcCain contends that pork spending, which is typically earmarked quietly into massive federal spending bills, forces costs onto every taxpayer that should be borne only by the people who benefit from the projects.\n\n\nThe latest broadside by McCain against Obama came in a speech at a rally in Tampa, Fla., on Sept. 16, 2008.\n\n\n\u201cI have never asked for a single earmark, pork barrel project for my state of Arizona. Sen. Obama has asked for $932-million dollars in earmarks, literally $1-million for every day that he\u2019s been in Congress.\u201d\n\n\nWe've examined the first part of that sentence, about McCain's own record on pork requests,\n\nhere.\n\nIn this item, we'll focus on what he says about Obama, which is nearly identical to what McCain said in a mailer to Florida voters that has been circulating for more than a week.\n\n\nThe mailer says, \"Obama has requested $1-million in pork barrel spending for every working day he has been in the Senate.\"\n\n\nObama, on his Web site, has listed every earmark he's requested \u2013 but not necessarily received \u2013 during that time. It totals $931.3-million, even though the Illinois senator earlier this year said he would eschew any pork for fiscal 2009. The key phrase in McCain's mailer, \"for every working day\" is missing from the remarks McCain made in his Tampa speech. Obama was elected in 2004 and took office January 3, 2005. Since then, there have been about 930 working days, as they are defined by most people, Monday through Friday, excluding holidays, which would mean McCain is on solid ground in the mailer.\n\n\nTechnically, Obama's been \"in Congress\" for more than 1,350 days, if you count weekends. So how many points do you take off for McCain not saying \"every\n\nworking\n\nday\"? Not many. We say this claim is Mostly True.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharlie Kirk\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Joe Biden admits he is governing like a 'dictator.'\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Daniel Funke \u2022 January 28, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-15986"}
