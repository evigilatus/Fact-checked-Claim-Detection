For August, the rate was 4.5 percent, according to the latest figures available when Saslaw made his claim.\nThese monthly figures date to 1976, but you don\u2019t have to go back too far to find a time when the rate was lower than 4.5 percent.\nIt was lower than that level each month during the 149 months from May 1996 through September 2008. During that period, there were times it even was below the 3 percent threshold and actually reached a low point of 2.1 percent in October and November of 2000.\nIn September 2008, as the recession took hold, Virginia\u2019s jobless rate started to grow at a brisk clip and eventually hit 7.4 percent by January 2010. The rate has trended down since then.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Boysko\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in a committee debate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe United States is the only industrialized, modernized country that does not already have a paid family medical leave program in place.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 4.5 percent figure for August is the lowest the rate has been since it started to spike in 2008, Gov. Terry McAuliffe said in a Sept. 18 news release.\nSam Sterling, Saslaw\u2019s campaign manager, said the senator was trying to reiterate the governor\u2019s point that unemployment is the lowest since 2008, but he didn\u2019t say that during the debate.\n\"He had meant to say that (Virginia) has its lowest unemployment rate since 2008,\" Sterling wrote in an email.\nWe also should note that Virginia has seen other periods of sub-4.5 percent unemployment, including 39 months from May 1987 through July 1990 and from December 1994 through April 1995.\nOur ruling\nSaslaw said during the debate that Virginia\u2019s unemployment rate is the lowest in the state\u2019s history. Figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show he\u2019s wrong, and the senator\u2019s campaign says he garbled his talking point.\nWe rate the claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05868"}
