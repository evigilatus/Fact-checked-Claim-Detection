On Caucus Day, Iowa election officials issued public statements denouncing their numbers and the narrative.\nThe current data released by Iowa election officials don\u2019t support Kirk\u2019s tweet.\nIowa disputes report\nKirk\u2019s viral tweet makes the same claim as a Feb. 3 report published by Judicial Watch, a conservative legal group.\nThe Judicial Watch report says \"eight Iowa counties have more voter registrations than their eligible voting-age population.\" Two of them, Johnson and Scott counties, are the locations of Davenport and Iowa City, respectively.\nThe report was based on its analysis of data from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission and the Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey.\n\"Dirty voting rolls can mean dirty elections and Iowa needs to undertake a serious effort to address its voting rolls,\" said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton in the news release.\nRELATED: We fact-checked the Democrats' closing push in Iowa before the caucuses\nIowa officials refuted the report. A Feb. 3 news release from Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate said his office\u2019s data \"shows this information to be false.\"\n\"It\u2019s unfortunate this organization continues to put out inaccurate data regarding voter registration, and it\u2019s especially disconcerting they chose the day of the Iowa Caucus to do this,\" Pate said in the statement. \"My office has told the organization, and others who have made similar claims, that their data regarding Iowa is deeply flawed and their false claims erode voter confidence in elections.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe reached out to Kirk and Judicial Watch for comment, but neither has responded with one. It appears they were using old voter registration numbers..\nAn \u2018apples-to-oranges measure\u2019\nWe took a look at the most recent voter registration and population data from Iowa\u2019s government and the Census Bureau. The numbers don\u2019t support what Kirk said, and experts say comparing them is flawed.\nAmong the counties identified by Judicial Watch, none have more active registered voters than adults.\u00a0\nFor example, Scott County \u2014 the largest county included in the Judicial Watch story \u2014 has an estimated population of 131,961 people ages 18 and older, according to 2018 data from the Census\u2019s American Community Survey. According to the Iowa secretary of state, there are 127,737 total voter registrations, 115,393 of which are active.\nJudicial Watch\u2019s story looked at \"total registrations,\" which includes inactive voters. In Iowa, inactive voters are those that have not responded to notices from the state asking them to verify their registration and residence.\u00a0\nOnly one county, Lyon, has more total registered voters than adults: 8,490 to 8,430. But that data is from 2018. The Iowa secretary of state\u2019s office says 8,117 of voters in Lyon County are active.\nEither way, experts say comparing voter rolls and Census estimates isn\u2019t an accurate measurement of registration rates.\n\"That\u2019s an apples-to-oranges measure. They measure different things, at different times, with different types of levels of certainty,\" said Justin Levitt, a Loyola Law School professor, in an email. \"And so it\u2019s really bad science to claim that a disconnect between those two numbers means that there\u2019s fraud.\"\nEven if there were more registered voters than voting-age adults in some Iowa counties, experts told us it would not amount to voter fraud.\n\"For there to be voter fraud in connection to bloated voter rolls, you\u2019d have to see people going to the polling places and see them voting in places of people who have moved or died,\" said Richard Hasen, a law professor at the University of California at Irvine. \"Not only would that be a difficult thing to do \u2026 you\u2019d have to do this on a wide enough scale to sway an election without being able to verify how the people you\u2019ve paid to do this have voted.\"\nVoter fraud remains rare in American elections. A database maintained by the conservative Heritage Foundation has documented 17 confirmed instances of voter fraud in Iowa dating back to 2011.\nOur ruling\nA tweet from Charlie Kirk claims that \"EIGHT Iowa counties have more adults registered to vote than voting-aged adults living there.\"\nVoter registration data and a statement from Iowa\u2019s secretary of state, as well as population estimates from the Census Bureau, refute that claim. And experts say comparing voter data to population estimates isn\u2019t a good measure of registration rates in the first place.\u00a0\nKirk\u2019s tweet is inaccurate. We rate it False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17325"}
