More recently, its schools were closed for six months following the outbreak of the Ebola virus in 2014. Our partners at Africa Check looked at the available survey data to determine the accuracy of Rosenberg\u2019s claim.\nRecent data doesn\u2019t support claim\nRosenberg, who won the Pulitzer for non-fiction\u00a0The Haunted Land: Facing Europe's Ghosts After Communism,\u00a0told Africa Check that her claim was based on a Liberian database of statistics collected from the United Nations Children\u2019s Emergency Fund (UNICEF). The database reported that 37.9 percent of children are married in Liberia by 18. That is fractionally higher than the female youth literacy rate of 37.2 percent, according to the UNICEF database.\nThe problem is those figures come from 2007 reports and are out of date.\nThe 37.9 percent figure for child marriage appears to track back to Liberia\u2019s Demographic and Health Survey from 2007. The youth literacy figure is likely from a 2007 UNESCO Institute for Statistics\u2019 estimate. The estimate covers women between the ages of 15-24, not just girls 18 and under.\nThe most recent data comes from the country\u2019s 2013 Demographic and Health Survey.\nTeen marriage rates in Liberia\nThe Demographic and Health Survey presents data in five year increments for people aged 15 to 49. Women who are 18 fall into the youngest age group of 15 to 19. However, the survey is missing data for marriage rates for this age group.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Godlewski\n\n\nstated on January 9, 2021 in Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all women that lost jobs (in the December jobs report), it was mostly Black and Latina women. In fact, white women gained employment.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Nusaiba Mizan \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead, a United Nations Children\u2019s Emergency Fund note on interpreting child marriage data recommends using the next age group: \"Looking at the group of women 20 to 24 years old is simpler and allows for the inclusion of all girls who were married or in union by age 18 within the closest time period for which complete data are available.\"\nFollowing this standard, the 2013 Demographic and Health Survey shows that 35.9 percent of Liberian women aged 20 to 24 reported being married by the time they were 18. This method is imperfect because it doesn\u2019t tell us about the chances that a girl under 20 today will have been married by 18. However, it gives us the best estimate for youth marriage rates for a group of young women who could reasonably be called girls.\nLiteracy rates in Liberia\nThe 2013 survey reported a literacy rate of 64.2 percent for women between 15 and 24 years of age. Someone is considered literate if they went to high school or if they can read a whole sentence or part of that sentence.\nThe literacy rate decreases slightly to 58.9 percent when you look at women ages 20 to 24.\nOther organizations define literacy more strictly. For example, UNESCO doesn\u2019t include people who can only read part of a sentence in the literate population. If we apply UNESCO\u2019s literacy definition to Liberian women aged aged 20 to 24, literacy drops to 51.2 percent \u2013 still much higher than the marriage figure of 35.9 percent.\nOur Ruling\nRosenberg made the claim that a Liberian woman is \"more likely to be married by 18 than to know how to read.\"\nThis claim relies on data from an old 2007 survey. Using a more recent survey and the closest age group for which data are available, the comparison doesn\u2019t hold. Young Liberian women are more likely to know how to read than be married.\nWe rate this claim Mostly False.\nThis fact-check originally was published by Africa Check.
