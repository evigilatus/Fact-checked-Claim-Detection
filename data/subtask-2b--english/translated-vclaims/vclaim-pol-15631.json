If you have a pre-existing condition, the insurance company will normally not pay for the treatment. James Rock, President of the American Medical Association, when asked when he appeared in the Fox News on Sunday, 16 August 2009, whether the democratic health plan would result in quotas for older patients. On January 13, 2021, in a story, General David Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for the use of marines in epithelial security, and said, \"We're not working for you.\" Roach said, \"On January 17, 2021, Samantha Buterman, \"Well, there's a myth that rations don't happen now.\" \"In the United States, if women are pregnant and in the individual market,f try to obtain health insurance, That's why this bill is important. Get rid of some of the classes that are happening right now.\" The Association approved the version of the Health Care Reform Legislation issued by the House of Representatives in July. First, we must emphasize that he only talks about a relatively small number of women who buy their coverage through what the insurers call the individual market. About two thirds of women have health insurance through their employers or husbands &apos; employers, and about 13 per cent have general coverage such as medical or military health care. Thus, 19 per cent of persons affected by these restrictions are now uninsured and 6 per cent have coverage purchased on the individual market. These policies are sold directly to an individual by a private insurance company, and the buyer does not have the same means of consumer protection that are routinely granted to those who enjoy coverage through the employer. For example, in employer-based health plans, persons have benefited from maternity coverage requirements that are related to the Federal Act on Discrimination in Pregnancy of 1978. However, individual plans are not included under that umbrella, which is organized according to the mandate. In 39 states, listed here, insurance companies can reject anyone for almost any reason. It can be because you have a preexisting condition, such as cancer or diabetes. Pregnancy is also almost always calculated, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, which represents state government officials who regulate insurance sold within their borders. So if you're pregnant and you live in one of these 39 states, it's very likely you're lucky to have individual health coverage. You have to pay for your own care from your own pocket or you're looking for charity. Coverage is not much better in the remaining 11 states. These states have \"secured issue\" laws which state that insurance companies cannot refuse their applications on the basis of their state of health or state of risk. But there is a warning: even if the insurance company is to provide you with a plan, it can set exclusions on what the plan covers. The National Institute of Statistics and Census usually states that these exceptions last from six to 12 months, which excludes most or all of the maternity coverage. (After the expiry of the period of exclusion, the insurer must cover these conditions, i.e. the subsequent pregnancy can be covered). :: One category of individual policy makers has a slightly better level? :: Those who left the employer &apos; s plan, which provided them with continuous coverage of the situation already in place. Under the Health Transfer and Accountability Act of 1996, or the Comprehensive Health Insurance Act, persons in this category can obtain a plan to cover their pre-existing situation after they have exhausted the old employer's coverage under the Act known as \"Cobra.\" However, the State must only submit at least one \"HIPAA Plan\" within its borders, rather than requiring every insurance company operating in the State to submit a single plan. These schemes may have unfavourable conditions and high premiums. Then we go back to Roch's claim. The health-care reform legislation currently under consideration by Congress would improve the situation of pregnant women seeking health insurance by prohibiting restrictions based on pre-existing circumstances. However, for the time being, Rocca is right that pregnancy is a pre-existing situation and prevents many women from obtaining coverage if they apply for insurance in the individual market. We find his words correct.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-15631"}
