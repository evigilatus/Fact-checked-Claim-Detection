A press release distributed by the Texas House Democratic Assembly paints a bleak picture of the future of education in Texas. \"Do not make any mistake,\" says the May 18 statement, attributed to six members of the House of Representatives, including the leader of the group Jessica Farar of Houston. \"Some neighborhood schools are closed. Before kindergartens for 100,000 children, programs that teach children music and art, advanced placement courses in mathematics and science are all at risk. A budget vote that leaves the Rain Day Fund is a vote to kill these programs.\" It is widely reported that school districts throughout the state have been developing plans for the segregation of teachers, refining programmes and taking other measures in anticipation of expected reductions in State educational aid. But do the counties also close the campus? There are more than 8,000 public schools in Texas. For our request for details on the closure of schools in the neighbourhood, the executive director of the assembly, Roger Garza, sent us a list of more than 90 schools classified in various ways, including \"reorganisation of classes,\" \"declared closure\" and \"probable closure/assembly.\" We have asked for clarification on some items, but no response has been received. When we asked the Texas Education Agency for information on school closures, the spokesman for Debbie Ratcliffe told us that the Agency &apos; s database showed only the actual -- unexpected -- closures that the State usually reported in the summer. \"This is when I expected any closed school for budgetary reasons to show up,\" she said. So we went ahead with our own research, we looked at the list sent by the Rassemblement, reading news reports and talking to school districts to find nearby schools that are closed because of upcoming cuts in state funding. We found a total of seven schools: ** Four primary schools (a total of 1,300 students) in Houston Province. The provincial spokesman, Jason Spencer, said that because of the proposed cuts in the State budget, the administration had determined that these small schools were no longer able to provide some key services - for example, to have a librarian or nurse - so that they would not open in the fall, thus saving the province $1.6 million. Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" \u2022 26 January 2021, the list of Democrats for possible closures includes dozens of other schools in Houston that do not face imminent closure. This may be because the District Director, Terry Greer, started in December a review of 66 underutilized university campuses, all of which have low enrolment. However, he eventually recommended that only the four schools be closed. ** Primary school (490 students) in Hto County, North Austin. According to Austin's American article on March 23, Superintendent Doug Killian said, \"We were hoping that if we shut down the school and cut our overheads, The district spokesman, Emily Boswell, told us that the closure of Hill Primary Veterans School would save the province $1 million next year. ** Primary school (500 students) in Edgewood County, San Antonio. The story of \"San Antonio Express News\" on April 19 describes the school council's vote to close the Coronado/Escobar Primary School as \"the first closed school in the province of Bixar related to the expected cuts in the state budget.\" On April 18, on the KSat website, Superintendent Elizabeth Garza was quoted as saying, \"We had to come up with different options to cut our budget by about 10%.\" It is expected that the closure will save $1.5 million in operating costs, as stated by the provincial spokesman, Maclovo P\u00e9rez. ** Middle school (340 students) in Cedar Hill County, South-West Dallas. We told the chief finance officer in the county Mike McSwain that the school board voted to shut down the Beltlin middle school because of upcoming cuts in state funding, saved the area $550,000. We have also identified four more schools - two in Abilene and two in Little Elm, north of Dallas - to be closed. However, we did not include it in this list because officials from those provinces told us that the closures were in business before the provinces started planning to reduce the State budget. Finally, we have found at least five other provinces that have discussed the closure of schools to help solve their budgetary problems, and have either decided not to do so or have not yet taken a final decision. Among them is the Austin school area, where more than a dozen university campuses have been identified as \"perhaps\" closures on the assembly list. According to articles published by the United States of America, provincial officials are developing a proposal that takes into account the Task Force report recommending the closure of nine schools over the next several years. The school board is not expected to take action on the closures until autumn. In their statement, the Democratic Legislators indicated that some district schools would be closed as a result of State budget cuts. I think that depends on your definition of \"some.\" The Democratic Assembly of the House of Representatives has sent us a list of more than 90 schools, but we have found only seven schools - out of thousands of schools throughout the state - that will close because the legislature reduces educational aid. We appreciate the Democrats' statement that it is often true.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13004"}
