The post described Trump eating only the skin and fat from Kentucky Fried Chicken and making Mead remove all the brown M&M\u2019s from a McDonald\u2019s McFlurry.\nWhile Trump has been known to favor Col. Sanders at times, this story is ersatz news dressed up as a true story.\nAs an appetizer, we should note that the White House executive chef is Cristeta Comerford, not anyone named Lisa Mead. The First Lady\u2019s office confirmed Comerford still runs the kitchen, a job she has held since 2005. (There is a mention of the factual recent resignation of Office of Government Ethics director Walter Shaub Jr.)\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the real meat of this claim is that HalfwayPost.com identifies itself as being full of contrived stories.\nThe page header denotes the site as \"a St. Louis gazette of satirical, halfway real news.\" It\u2019s \"About the Halfway Post\" page said the staff is \"prone to satirical giggles, so if a headline seems too outlandish to be true it\u2019s probably because we made it up.\"\nWe attempted to contact the site through their online contact form, but did not receive a reply.\nTrump\u2019s culinary preferences have been a topic in the media before.\nHe\u2019s shown a fondness for taco bowls and had promised during his presidential campaign to feed Chinese President Xi Jinping \"a double-size Big Mac\" if he were to visit the White House.
