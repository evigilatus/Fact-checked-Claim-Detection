But President Donald Trump made it sound that way during his prime time address to the nation.\nSpeaking on the 18th day of a partial government shutdown, Trump claimed he made a concession to the Democrats in his appeal for $5.7 billion for a border wall.\n\"At the request of Democrats, it will be a steel barrier rather than a concrete wall,\" Trump said Jan. 8.\nWe found no evidence that Democrats requested the wall be made of steel. The White House did not respond to our request for comment.\nMick Mulvaney, Trump\u2019s acting chief of staff, however, said during an interview on Meet the Press on Jan. 6 that discussions with Democrats \"never even got to\" the \"definitional conversations\" on the wall, like whether a steel fence may qualify.\n\"Do we disagree on a wall, or do you really agree that maybe a steel fence qualifies as a fence and not a wall, and we want to build a steel barrier anyway?\" Mulvaney said.\nIn recent weeks, Trump has embraced a version of the wall that\u2019s different from the tall, concrete barrier he campaigned on.\n\"The Democrats, are saying loud and clear that they do not want to build a Concrete Wall - but we are not building a Concrete Wall, we are building artistically designed steel slats, so that you can easily see through it....,\" Trump tweeted on Dec. 18, 2018.\nWe could find no evidence that Democrats ever said they wanted a steel wall.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

The law, passed with Republican and Democratic support, provided $1.3 billion for fencing and additional money for other types of border security. The language made it so that the funds could only be used on repairing or extending fencing that had already been built under the Secure Fence Act of 2006.\nPelosi did not mention wall materials in her televised response to Trump. Instead, she talked about bringing more technology to the border.\n\"The fact is we all agree we need to secure our borders while honoring our values,\" Pelosi said. \"We can build the infrastructure and roads at our ports of entry, we can install new technology to scan cars and trucks for drugs coming into our nation. We can hire the personnel we need to facilitate trade and immigration at the border. We can fund more innovation to detect unauthorized crossings.\"\nThe New York Times reported that on Jan. 5, Democrats asked the administration for a detailed plan of how the requested $5.7 billion would be used. The Office of Management and Budget reiterated the president\u2019s request for a steel barrier. Democrats rebuffed that offer.\nOur ruling\nTrump said, \"At the request of Democrats, it will be a steel barrier rather than a concrete wall.\"\nThere is no evidence that Democrats asked for a steel barrier. Democratic leadership affirmed there has been no request for a steel barrier. Democrats have been pushing for other forms to secure the border, including the reinforcement of existing physical barriers, but have made no concessions on Trump\u2019s border wall proposals.\nWe rate this statement False.\n Share the Facts 2019-01-09 20:21:35 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  \"At the request of Democrats, it will be a steel barrier rather than a concrete wall.\"    Donald Trump President of the United States https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/politics/100000006296511/trump-live-address-nation.html   In a televised speech Tuesday, January 8, 2019 2019-01-08    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01145"}
