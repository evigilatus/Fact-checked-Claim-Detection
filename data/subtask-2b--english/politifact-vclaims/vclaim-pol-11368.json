But there\u2019s an anti-Obama email bouncing around Texas that some say unfairly roughs up one cowboy entertainer.\n\nWe were forwarded a chain email March 2, 2012, that purports to describe an event at the 2012 San Angelo rodeo, which was held February 16-26. Between saddle bronc events, according to the email, a rodeo clown performed a skit with a racially tinged punchline mocking President Barack Obama.\n\nAnd, the letter says, the crowd responded with \"an immediate deafening roar and standing ovation -- 6,000 strong. ...It lasted for 3-4 minutes... 100+ db (decibels) at least.\"\n\nDid a crowd of Texans cheer, and did the clown tell, a joke calling Obama a \"black imposter\"?\n\nWe talked by phone with Keith Isley of Goldston, N.C., the award-winning rodeo clown who performed the skit, and Boyd Polhamus, a Brenham rancher and professional rodeo announcer who was on horseback in the arena with Isley, serving as \"straight man\" for the jokes. Rodeo official Tom Thompson told us this skit took place February 22.\n\nIsley said his wife had been sent a copy of the email by the time he got home from Texas.\n\n\"The people, or the person, that started this has definitely misquoted what was said, and I told my wife, \u2018I know what I said, I know what took place, and it\u2019s definitely not what this person has seen or heard.\u2019 \"\n\nIsley said the comedy routine began with him being announced as Carlos Ortega, champion trick roper, and that the skit has to do with \"pretending to be someone you\u2019re not.\"\n\n\"That\u2019s the way it starts off,\" Isley said. \"There\u2019s a lot to the act. It was quoted in there (the email), me saying about the black president. That\u2019s the main thing; that\u2019s what everybody is getting so bent out of shape about. And that was not said by me.\"\n\nAccording to the email, after the announcer reveals that the supposed champion trick roper is a phony, the clown says, \"Well, actually I was thinking if a black imposter can pretend to be president of the United States, then I ought to be able to pretend I'm a world champion trick roper!\"\n\nWe asked Isley to tell us how the joke did end, and he said, \"There\u2019s a lot of punchlines to the whole act. \u2018Black president\u2019 was not used in that act.\" The crowd reaction was also exaggerated, he said: \"They did respond; nothing to that amount.\"\n\nPolhamus agreed, telling us by email that the chain letter \"question is filled with hyperbole, and sadly, inaccuracy.\" Speaking about the email\u2019s anonymous author, Polhamus said, \"Where he is flat-plain wrong and inaccurate is in his use of the words \u2018black imposter.\u2019 Neither of those words were uttered by the clown or yours truly in the skit. In any context. Either separately or together.\"\n\nOther descriptions in the email are also off, he said.\n\n\"The coliseum in which the event is held barely holds 5,000 people, not 6,000. The introduction used to pretend the clown may actually be a noted trick roper from south of the border is not nearly as extravagant or embellished as the author of the e-mail asserts. The lines about speaking in Spanish and English are relatively accurate, but to call his physical motion a \u2018matador flourish\u2019 is a huge embellishment.\"\n\nThe crowd response was exaggerated, Polhamus said. \"There was no standing ovation, and while I didn\u2019t have a db meter on me, I\u2019ve heard 100 db roars before at football games and rodeos. And I would argue that the audience\u2019s response was nowhere near that loud, and I definitely take issue with the fact that the writer claims it lasted \u20183-4 minutes.\u2019 My best guess is whatever ovation it received was over in less than 15 seconds.\"\n\nJustin Jonas, executive director of the San Angelo rodeo, told us that there was an Obama joke, but it wasn\u2019t exactly the one laid out in the chain email. By Jonas\u2019 recollection, the clown, challenged for posing as world-class trick roper, replied: \"If Obama can impersonate a president, then I can impersonate a trick roper.\" Jonas said too that audience members appreciated the joke, but there was no standing ovation.\n\nThompson, the rodeo\u2019s marketing coordinator, also told us that there was no standing ovation and that the words \"black\" and \"imposter\" were not used.\n\n\"I remember when we made fun of George W. Bush and his vocabulary in our coliseum, and Bill Clinton and his girlfriends,\" Thompson said. \"We don\u2019t choose sides.\" The rodeo and stock show foundation is a tax-exempt charity, he said, \"and we go out of our way not to offend anybody.\"\n\nAn editor at the San Angelo Standard-Times, Sandy Rojas, and KLST-TV/KSAN-TV news director David Wagner told us that although their news organizations covered the rodeo every night, they had not heard about such an incident.\n\nThe version of the email PolitiFact received has at the bottom the name and title of Sheriff Cotton Elliott of King County, in the Texas Panhandle. Elliott told us he had received a version of the email and forwarded it to a friend, and later received a version with his name and title in large type at the bottom. He told us he did not write the email, did not know who had written it and was \"not pleased\" to learn his name had been attached to it.\n\nWe found two rodeo-goers who said they saw Isley\u2019s skit, but their recollections differ: One said he remembered hearing part of an Obama joke, the other did not.\n\nDon Miller, a precinct chair with the Tom Green County Republican Party who told us he was in the stands with his granddaughter during the skit, said he heard the crowd response but not the Obama joke itself. \u00a0\"I understood from the reaction that it had something to do with Obama and that it was, what\u2019s the right word, it was not in good taste with Obama,\" he said. Some people laughed and clapped, he said, but others booed and \"generally it was not received well.\"\n\nThough Miller told us his recollection was not clear (he was keeping an eye on his granddaughter), he said he thought the objectionable aspect of the joke was respect, not race.\n\n\"It was just that he (Obama) was pretending to be president, and it was the butt of the joke, like this guy was pretending to be a trick roper,\" he said.\n\n\"I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s funny. He is the president. Whether you like it or not, he is the president; he\u2019s not pretending to be president,\" Miller said. \"Even though I don\u2019t agree with anything he has done, he\u2019s still the president, and he deserves your respect of the office if nothing else.\"\n\nWas there any racial content to the skit? Miller says no.\n\n\"No, I don\u2019t think it had anything -- He could have been blue, and it wouldn\u2019t have made any difference. I don\u2019t think it had anything to do with race at all,\" Miller said.\n\nThe description of a standing ovation and a 100-decibel roar was \"baloney,\" he said. \"They didn\u2019t like that comment about the president.\"\n\nSan Angelo dentist Rudy Izzard told us he saw the clown\u2019s routine -- including his offering proof that he could speak Spanish by saying \"Taco Bell.\" There was no joke about Obama the time he was there, Izzard said. \"I would have noticed that,\" Izzard said. \"I just don\u2019t think they\u2019d allow that.\"\n\nLinda Shoemaker, chair of the Tom Green County Democratic Party, told us she had not heard of the incident or the email.\n\nWe sought video unsuccessfully. Wagner said his TV stations filmed competitive events but not the comedy routines. Mike Oliver, the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association\u2019s corporate accounts manager, said no videos were made by his organization because the San Angelo rodeo is not televised. On YouTube.com, several video clips are labeled as being from that rodeo, but we found none with this joke.\n\nOur ruling\n\nIsley appears to have made a wisecrack about Obama impersonating a president. However, we found no confirmation that the joke included a racial reference or that the audience gave a standing ovation. This chain email has an element of truth; we rate it Mostly False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11368"}
