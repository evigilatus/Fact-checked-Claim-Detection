It was a reminder to local officials to maintain a system of verifiable ballots to ensure security from foreign adversaries that may seek to interfere in future U.S. elections.\nIn 2019, the department's cybersecurity agency announced it would partner with election officials and election nonprofit VotingWorks to develop an auditing tool known as Arlo, which is provided to state election officials for free.\nAs for the watermark claims, \"the watch the water\" comment comes from a February 2018 QAnon thread, known as a \"Q drop,\" which are cryptic messages that the central figure of the conspiracy theory posts for followers to decipher.\u00a0\nNo one on the two-year-old message thread interpreted \"water\" to mean \"watermark,\" but the recent Facebook post tried\u00a0to connect the two.\nWatermarks do appear on some states\u2019 ballots, like California\u2019s, but there is no secret watermark on all ballots that was issued by the federal government to catch would-be cheaters.\nQAnon is a baseless conspiracy theory based on posts from Q, an anonymous internet persona who claims to be a government insider with information on a \"deep state\" plot against Trump.\nOur ruling\nA QAnon-related conspiracy theory claims that Trump, with the help of the Department of Homeland Security, added secret watermarks to ballots in order to catch Democrats cheating.\nThe federal government doesn\u2019t print ballots or play an active role in the mechanics of elections.
