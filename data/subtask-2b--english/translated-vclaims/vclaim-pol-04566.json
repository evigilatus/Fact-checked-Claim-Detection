But what about the part about putting \"cover on Iran's nuclear program\"? That's a harder question. Here, we will summarize our verifications of the historic arms control agreement since its conclusion in July 2015. In general terms, the agreement lifts the international economic sanctions imposed on Iran in exchange for the State &apos; s agreement to limit nuclear technologies and to allow nuclear weapons inspections for 10 to 25 years. A salient point for critics is that while Iran must give up 97 per cent of its stock of enriched uranium and most centrifuges that can enrich more, that capacity has not been completely lost. Iran may have fewer centrifuges operating for 10 years, but research and development on advanced centrifuges will be limited. It is assumed that uranium enrichment will remain at inappropriate levels for the use of weapons over the next 15 years. Iran is no longer able to produce plutonium, which is another element that can create a bomb. To ensure that Iran does what it has agreed to do, the international inspectors will monitor known nuclear sites for those 15 years. It can also enter an undeclared site suspected of being a nuclear user, although Iran may take up to 24 days to allow inspectors to enter these sites. There was a lot of discussion about how to verify such activity. The control of centrifuge production is scheduled to continue for 20 years and the monitoring of uranium mills and mines for 25 years. Iran must also abide by the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), which it signed in 1974, thereby no longer seeking nuclear weapons. Other international treaties must also be followed. In theory, Iran must abide by those treaties forever, even after the 25-year inspection period. Several experts told Poletti Fak that, as long as Iran was bound by the terms of the agreement, it could not build a nuclear weapon. One of the main mechanisms of the agreement is that it prolongs the \"exit period\" in Iran - how long would it take Iran to produce a nuclear weapon if it were to rebuild a nuclear weapon? While some estimates suggest that time is two or three months before the transaction is concluded, the cut-off time is generally considered to be approximately one year under the terms of the agreement. Iran \"has no capacity to fertilize uranium to produce enough bomb-type material,\" Darryl Kempal, Executive Director of the Arms Control Association, said Politi Fact. \"It'll take more than a year. We'll figure out any attempt to do this within weeks, if not days.\" The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 On January 11, 2021, Richard Neviu, a researcher and director of a government economic industry programme, sanctions and energy markets at Columbia University, told Politi Fact in 2015 that the deal was definitely hampering Iran &apos; s nuclear programme. \"Fifteen years of restrictions and more than 20 years of enhanced inspection will not facilitate an Iranian nuclear weapon,\" he said. However, all of this depends on Iran &apos; s commitment to the Agreement forever - something that can only be said over time. Matthew Croning of Georgetown University, a foreign policy adviser in the 2012 Mitt Romney presidential campaign, said that once the maximum enrichment limit was over, it could pave the way for a nuclear weapon. He said that the installation of more and more sophisticated centrifuges \"will take at least several months.\" \"It's hard to know how long this will take because Iran hasn't been clean in its past arms work, and we don't know how much progress they might be able to make clandestinely over the next 15 years,\" he said: \"But again, several months is a reasonable assumption.\" After that, it will have to associate the warhead with its ballistic missiles, but given its experience in installing conventional warheads on its already large stockpile of ballistic missiles, this should be a relatively routine issue, as Kronig said. \"So, in short, after the border has come to an end, it is likely that it will take Iran several months to one year or so to obtain a real nuclear weapon that can be surrendered,\" he said. To build an arsenal of nuclear weapons, it will take several years. Our rule, Clinton, said, \"We put a cover on Iran's nuclear program without firing a single shot.\" There are many doubts about the success of the Agreement over time, particularly what will happen when some of its provisions are over. As the saying goes, there are no guarantees in life. However, most of the independent experts we have investigated have agreed that the deal is paper-based and close to the best results that the United States can achieve through diplomatic means. Therefore, we give them some benefit from the doubt. As long as you know \"put a lid on\" as \"keep an eye on\" -- a definition we think is reasonable -- instead of \"ensuring that nothing will ever happen,\" Clinton has a reasonable situation. We're mostly assessing her statement right. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/36d26cd0-52c4-49c6-a2a5-cd7e0d61b130", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04566"}
