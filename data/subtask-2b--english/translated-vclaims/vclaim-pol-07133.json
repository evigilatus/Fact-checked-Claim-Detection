The moderator stopped the exchange by noting that television announcements in the race had made several allegations about possible changes in the medical care system and where candidates had stopped those changes. Bryan was asked, \"What exactly would you change about the current system, if anything?\" Brayor responded by charging him a fee that had voted to cut $700 billion in medical care by voting for Obamakari. (We have assessed Cotton's previous claim that Brewer \"cut medical care to pay for Obama's care\" at $700 billion for half a Tro. In fact, Brewer said that Cotton \"a vote for the same $700 billion (cuts) he likes to criticize me for.\" (We have assessed this claim as completely different) When the opportunity to respond, Cotton took the interviewer &apos; s claim directly. Cotton said, \"The answer to your question is: I will not make any changes to the current Medicare system for current retirees and anyone approaching retirement.\" We were wondering if that's what his platform really shows. The answer depends on two separate questions. First, does Cotton support the abolition of Obama's care? Second, if Obama's care programme were to be abolished, would that expedite changes to the medical care system either for current retirees or for persons approaching retirement? The short answers are yes and yes. Here are the more detailed explanations. Does Cotton support the abolition of Obamacker? Cotton employees no longer asked the Polyte Fact, but we found many examples of cotton that say that Obama's care should be abolished. \u2022 \"I will fight to abolish and replace Obama's care with free market reforms that enable patients and doctors to make health care decisions. Obama Kira must be completely abolished. - The location of the House of Representatives in Cotton, accessed on October 15, 2014. I'm gonna fight to break up Obama Kerr. - Cotton Facebook page, accessed on 15 October 2014. \u2022 \"What we have to do is cancel Obama's care, start over, and get it right.\" - Cotton at a press conference with the former Republican candidate for the President of the Republic, Met Romney, 21 August 2014. \"We will abolish Obama's care and replace it completely with numerous reforms of our health-care programme.\" - Cotton at a press conference, 13 April 2014 To this end, I will now support and vote in the next Congress in favour of all measures, including applications for release, which lead to the cancellation of its funding, cancellation of its authorization and cancellation. I will do so whether those measures are taken for the entire bill or the component parts that impose mandates, restrict the choice of patients and doctors and access, violate individual freedom and privacy, reduce health competition, increase costs or raise taxes.\" The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 On January 11, 2012, it should be noted that Cotton sometimes expressed a desire to replace the newly repealed law with something else. However, we failed to detect a case in which Cotton gave a detailed description of the medical care policies that would be reinstated after abolition. Cotton also expressed its openness to making more limited efforts, such as stopping the financing of the law, if the law could not be repealed. However, it is clear from these comments that abolition is his first option. To sum up: Yes, Cotton has consistently said that he wants to repeal the law. If Obama &apos; s care is abolished, will this accelerate changes in medical care for current beneficiaries? It will be. The most prominent element of the law that will disappear in the event of total abolition is the closure of the nuts hole. This is not the only example of benefits included in the Affordable Care Act that may disappear for current beneficiaries of the medical care system if the law is repealed and no alternative provisions are specifically enacted. The following are other examples drawn from the summary prepared by the Kaiser Family Foundation of the Health Care Act: \"Deleting the cost-sharing of preventive services covered by medical care.\" \u2022 Authorize medical care coverage for personal protective plan services, including an annual comprehensive health risk assessment. \u2022 Provide incentives for medical care and assistance recipients to complete behavioural adjustment programmes, such as cessation of smoking. \u2022 Reduction in the special amount qualifying the participant for catastrophic prescription coverage. \u2022 Extend medical care coverage to individuals who have been exposed to environmental health risks as a result of living in an area subject to an emergency declaration issued on 17 June 2009, and have developed certain health conditions as a result. \u2022 The prohibition of medical-care benefit schemes from imposing higher cost-sharing requirements for certain medical-care benefits than is required under the traditional fee-for-service programme. In other words, the current beneficiaries of medical care would feel a great deal of influence if no substitute law were passed after abolition. We see no evidence that Cotton has undertaken to protect any of these specific provisions following abolition. The Governor Cotton said that under his platform he would make no change in the current system of current retirees and anyone approaching retirement. Cotton has consistently supported the abolition of the Obama medical care system, and although he has sometimes noted the need to enact a law \"to replace\" this law, we have not been able to find any examples in which he specifically undertook to protect the medical care policies that would be abolished if the law were repealed, such as the closure of the doughnut hatch and free preventive health-care services. We assess his claim is wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07133"}
