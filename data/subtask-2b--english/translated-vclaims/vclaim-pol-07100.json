According to Rick Scott and Charlie Christ, the Governor &apos; s campaign 2014 is not about politics, but more about any candidate who has done nothing less as governor. \u25cf Take the name of Christian care that can help her in the future world. No, really, someone has to take it, because the governor didn't. Now they're betting on each other for him. During the CNN debate on Tuesday in Jacksonville, Christ said: \"He will not raise a finger to expand the Medicaid program.\" He said that Floridans suffered from the resulting lack of medical care, in addition to the loss of jobs that expansion was expected to bring. For the first time, Scott responded by accusing Christ of managing State debt. \"And then you want to talk about Medicaid,\" he said. \"I was the governor when he passed. Why didn't you pass it after that? Why didn't you expand it then?\" \u25cf Why didn't he expand it then? Can Christ do anything about Medicaid's expansion while he was in the office? We decided to look at the confirmation and find out. One of the original provisions of the Health Care Act signed by President Barack Obama was the expansion of the Medicaid programme, a federal-state programme to cover the poorest uninsured groups. The new guidelines for medical aid covered all up to 138 per cent of the federal poverty level. In Florida, this could have reached between 800,000 and 1 million people receiving coverage. The federal government would have paid 100% of the costs for the first three years starting in 2014, gradually reducing to 90% by 2020. In order to obtain funds for this expansion, the Affordable Care Act offers a comprehensive proposal or nothing: to change the state law to cover all eligible residents and obtain expansion funds, or to refuse to comply and lose all federal money for Medicaid. This isn't just expansion money, this is every dollar Medicaid program in the state -- billions of dollars a year -- the movement's critics immediately denounced as a crushing punishment. Christ was in the last year of his term, in preparation for a bad presidency of the Senate, when Obama signed the bill into law on 23 March 2010. Florida joined Virginia and dozens of other states in prosecuting the federal government on the same day, insisting on Washington that citizens cannot be forced to buy insurance and protest the terms of Medicaid expansion. \u2219 Elements of the law were to enter into force in stages (medecaid extended beyond three and a half years, until 2014), and several states waited to know what had happened with the lawsuit. What is the Governor doing? The Republican-controlled legislature had already begun its 60-day law-making cycle, and it was therefore possible for Crist to comply with the law at the time. However, since legislators begin working on draft laws in September before the session, and given the initial unpopularity of the new law, this scenario is highly unlikely. The state of Florida also budgeted only for one year at a time, and many details of the law were in the air so that they could not be fully addressed in 2010. \"I think it was difficult, but perhaps not impossible, for Charlie to move on to Medicaid expansion, because the components of the law were very uncertain with ACA at that point in his tenure,\" Kevin Walsh, Assistant Professor of Political Science at Broward College, said Politi Fact Florida. Scott's campaign told us that Krest could have handled expansion in a special session. But this isn't practical. There was no hurry to implement the expansion of Medikid -- remember, it wouldn't start until 2014 -- and there was no great likelihood that Republican legislators would agree to expand even if Christ reconnected with them (at a cost of about $45,000 a day). On January 14, 2021, Chuck Grasley stated in a tweet that insulin prices had \"lost the RoOOF for patients/taxpayers bc from the manufacturer, a health plan and PBM Biz practices.\" By Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2012, the experts also told us that the idea of developing compatible legislation so quickly was not practical. (A special session convened by Christ that year to discuss offshore oil exploration on the GOP party voting line was completed in 49 minutes. \" Technically, Scott is right,\" said Gil Wilensky, Senior Fellow of the Health Centre in Project HOPE. However, since the interest did not enter into force for two years, there was no clear need to pass legislation immediately. The United States Supreme Court ultimately ruled on June 28, 2012, that while the federal government could force people to buy health insurance, it could not threaten to withhold Medicaid's money for refusing to comply. This has made expansion an option for each state. By then, Scott was in office. Most states - even those that overwhelmingly supported the expansion of the Medicaid programme - waited until the Supreme Court &apos; s decision to formally expand their medical assistance programmes through legislation became final. Before this year's campaign, Christ didn't say much about the expansion of Medicaid. In March 2010, he opposed the Affordable Care Act and favoured abolition. In July 2010, he danced back and forth on the cancellation but still wanted to modify it. Within two hours on August 27, he said that he would have voted in favour of the bill and opposed it. For the record, Christ now says he's okay with it. Scott, opposed to the Affordable Care Act, was initially against Medicaid provisions, largely because of concerns about the additional costs of government taxpayers (which we mentioned as 10 per cent). In 2013, he changed his mind, but did not push the legislature to enact a law to increase medical coverage. To date, Florida has refused to expand. Christ put forward the idea that an executive order could be issued if elected, in the same context as the Republican Ohio Goff. (John Cassick) Casi\u0107 signed an executive order last year to expand the program, using an ambiguous government entity called the Control Board. Florida doesn't have one of these, so it's unclear whether Christ can take similar action. Scott certainly doesn't think so. \"Medicaid's stretch cannot be achieved at a whim from the Executive Office,\" said Scott in October. \"It requires legislative action.\" Our judge, Scott, said that Charlie Christ could have expanded Medicaid after the Health Care Act was passed, but he didn't. The experts with whom we spoke said that this was possible, with the help of the legislature, but probably not. The law was so new that it could not be passed during the 2010 legislative session. Even if Krest wanted to be discussed by legislators, they would be anti-ideal. The State was a plaintiff in a lawsuit against the Government, and there was no urgent need to enact such a sweeping change. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that give a different impression. We're mostly assessing the statement wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07100"}
