This figure was mentioned in a recent press release accompanied by a mental health veteran and his suicide prevention bill. In the statement, Manchen stated that the aim of the bill was \"to link more veterans to the mental health care they need and receive,\" and Manchin said in release that \"over 20 veterans are estimated to die of suicide every day\" and that \"[14 of them have not received treatment or care from VA.\" Data have to be placed in context, but statistics are largely related to the goal. In 2016, the Suicide Prevention Office of the Department of Veterans Affairs published a report which concluded that \"In 2014, an average of 20 veterans died every day of suicide. Six of the 20 new users of Veterans &apos; Health Management Services were in 2013 or 2014. &quot; The report states that the data \"reaffirms that when compared with their untroubled peers, most veterans are at increased risk of suicide.\" At the same time, the report warned that the total number of daily suicides obscured the major differences within the age group and gender between the war veterans.

Tell Polyte Fact West Virginia he considers the number 20 per day accurate. Manchen, our governor, said, \"It is estimated that over 20 veterans die of suicide every day.\" This figure is confirmed by the most recent data of the Department of Veterans &apos; Affairs, although it is worth adding some context - that the total figure masks the significant disparity between different age groups and between men and women.
