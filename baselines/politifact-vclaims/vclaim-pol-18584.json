They\u2019re called poll watchers. A very safe, very nice thing. They were thrown out. They weren\u2019t allowed to watch. You know why? Because bad things happen in Philadelphia, bad things.\"\nTrump\u2019s accusation is full of misinformation.\nUnder state law, poll watchers in Pennsylvania may only observe voting at traditional polling places on Election Day, and they must be certified by the state to do so. But the state hasn\u2019t designated any Republican poll watchers yet \u2014 that\u2019s typically done a few days before an election. And even if the state had, those people wouldn\u2019t be allowed to watch anything until Nov. 3.\nSo, what is Trump talking about? Let\u2019s unpack his remarks.\nOn Tuesday, Philadelphia opened new\u00a0satellite elections offices\u00a0where mail ballots can be requested, completed, and submitted.\n\"It\u2019s a mail-in vote without having to use the mail,\" Lisa Deeley, chair of the Philadelphia city commissioners, said outside the Liacouras Center at Temple University, where one of the new offices is located.\nOn Tuesday afternoon, a woman arrived at the satellite office inside Overbrook Elementary School in West Philadelphia, and told a supervisor she was there to monitor \"the integrity of the election.\" The supervisor told her she was not allowed inside the building unless she wanted to use the office\u2019s services.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL. Lin Wood\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in an interview with the Patriotically Correct Radio Show\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"China was behind the interference and the effort to overthrow our government and the election, election fraud.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Daniel Funke \u2022 January 19, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain: Poll watchers in Pennsylvania are only allowed to observe voting on Election Day.\nThe woman told The Inquirer she had been hired by the Trump campaign to monitor the West Philadelphia site and calmly stated she had a right to be inside. Once again: She did not. No poll watchers in Pennsylvania will be allowed until Nov. 3.\nThe state also requires that poll watchers be registered to vote in the county where they wish to observe voting. The Trump campaign has been\u00a0fighting in federal court\u00a0since July to overturn that requirement, and to get approval for poll watchers to have access to all locations in Pennsylvania where votes are being cast \u2014 a move that would open access to sites like the one at the heart of the president\u2019s debate night accusations.\nSatellite offices are a new feature of Pennsylvania elections created under Act 77, a law enacted last year that permits any registered voter to cast a ballot by mail. The satellite offices make it easier for voters to request and submit mail ballots. Previously, voters could only request mail ballots through the mail or in person at the main county elections offices. They now have more places to go.\nIt\u2019s also important to note that none of the mail ballots submitted at satellite locations popping up across Pennsylvania in the weeks ahead are allowed to be counted until Election Day under state law.\nOur ruling\nTrump said poll watchers were \"thrown out\" of a polling place in Philadelphia. But the incident we witnessed, and any others that occurred Tuesday, took place at satellite offices, not at traditional polling places. And they involved self-appointed observers, not licensed poll watchers.\nWhile mail voting was indeed happening in physical locations Tuesday, and Trump supporters tried to watch, that voting wasn\u2019t happening at polling places and those supporters weren\u2019t poll watchers.\nTrump either knew or should have known that poll watchers aren\u2019t allowed at satellite locations, because his campaign is fighting in federal court right now to change that. His statement is not accurate. We rate it False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18584"}
