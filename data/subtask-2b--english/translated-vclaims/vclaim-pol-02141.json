Trump said: \"He was looking and seeing black unemployment at its lowest level in the history of our country. He sees unemployment in Spanish countries at the lowest level in our country &apos; s history. \"Women's unemployment is the lowest it has been for about 19 years.\" Trump has already made allegations of this kind, but it's been a few months, so we thought about taking a fresh look at the numbers. In March 2018, the unemployment rate among African Americans was 6.9%. This is not a record, but it's very close. This record was 6.8 percent in December 2017, and it's also under Tramp's control. This is the full data on the unemployment rate among blacks since the statistics were first calculated in 1972: unemployment among Hispanics was 5.1 per cent in March 2018. That's not a record either, it's close again. The unemployment rate in the Spanish region was three times lower than in 2017, in June, October and November. This holy stand is all happening once and for all. These are the complete historical data: Jennifer Bansco was mentioned on January 18, 2021 in a discussion by the Committee. \"The United States is the only industrial country that has been modernized and does not already have a paid family medical leave programme.\" This percentage was slightly lower during the previous period in Trump &apos; s presidency - 3.9 per cent in October 2017. The unemployment rate among women was lower in December 2000, at 3.8 per cent. This is within the 19-year window that Trump mentioned. Here the whole set of data is summarized: some economists agree in additional contexts that presidents are not entitled to full credit or blame for the unemployment rate under their control. The President does not have the full strength in economic matters; the broader factors, from the business cycle to changes in technology to demographic shifts, play key roles. To the extent that the President deserves credit for the decrease in unemployment, the predecessor of Tramp, Barack Obama, deserves at least as much as Trump deserves. As these graphs show, the unemployment rate among blacks, Spanishs and women fell dramatically during the Obama era, while the country withdrew from the Great Depression. Black unemployment peaked at 16.6 per cent in April 2010, when Obama was president. It then fell by more than half to 7.8 per cent while Obama left office in January 2017. At the same time, Spanish unemployment peaked at 13% in August 2009 and fell to 5.9% at the end of the state of Obama in January 2017. Unemployment among women peaked at 9 per cent in November 2010, before falling to 4.8 per cent while leaving office in January 2017, a decline of almost half. The Governor Trump said: \"He was looking and seeing black unemployment at its lowest level in the history of our country. He sees unemployment in Spanish countries at the lowest level in our country &apos; s history. \"Women's unemployment is the lowest it has been for about 19 years.\" Unemployment rates among Afro-Americans and Spaniards have fallen unprecedented in recent months over the hour of Trump, and the unemployment rate among women has recently been the lowest in more than 18 years. It should be remembered, however, that to the extent that the Presidents deserve any credit for the economic conditions they were caring for, the significant rise in the rates of access to these low rates occurred before Trump became President. We're mostly evaluating the statement right.
