By February 2008, Royal Dutch Shell held leases to drill in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas, portions of the Arctic Ocean near the Alaskan mainland. No one had drilled there for two decades.\nBut lease-holding companies can\u2019t drill without first clearing a number of other procedural hurdles. Once it had sold Shell leases, the government still needed to grant dozens of technical approvals, including exploration plans, water permits and air permits.\nThat\u2019s where Begich, the only Democrat elected statewide, came in. After getting elected in November 2008, he made his priorities known to the White House. The New York Times reported that when Begich and Obama first met in 2008, Begich said of oil drilling issues, \"If I\u2019m elected, this is what I\u2019m going to focus on.\"\nBegich -- a Democrat working with a Democratic administration -- may have had more sway than his colleague, Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, in pushing along the permitting process.\nPeter Van Tuyn, whose law firm Bessenyey and Van Tuyn LLC has fought against oil drilling in the Alaskan Arctic, agrees that Begich has had a key role on the issue.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"His biggest influence has been picking up the phone or having those people into his office or in hearings and saying \u2018Dammit, we need to get this done,\u2019 \" Van Tuyn said.\nBegich told the Times that \"any time (Obama) initiated a call, I felt that was carte blanche to make my case\" for Arctic drilling. As of 2012, Begich had assembled a six-page chronology of contact on oil drilling between his office and the White House.\nEventually, in September 2012, Shell began drilling in the Chukchi Sea.\nHowever, it didn\u2019t go according to plan. After spending $5 billion on the project, Shell wasn\u2019t able to fully drill any wells that season. In March 2013, an Interior Department report found that Shell had violated permits, didn\u2019t test certain systems in advance and lost a drilling rig.\nAfter that, Shell said it still planned to drill during the summer of 2014. But the company backed out in January after a court sided with environmental groups in ruling that in 2008, the federal government had underestimated how much oil drilling would happen when awarding the lease.\nThis ruling didn\u2019t block all drilling, but it did put more legal obstacles in Shell\u2019s way. The administration could choose to appeal the decision, which only directly affects one lease sale, not all Arctic lease sales.\nShell\u2019s CEO said there was too much uncertainty to move forward with drilling in 2014. Other companies have leases to drill in the area as well, but experts told us they\u2019ve hung back and waited to see how Shell does. So, in 2014, no companies are drilling in the Alaska Arctic, despite the efforts of Begich and others.\nOur ruling\nBegich\u2019s ad claimed that \"he forced Washington to open up the Arctic Ocean to oil drilling.\" Begich wasn\u2019t in the Senate when the government awarded leases to Shell, but the leases were only the first step toward drilling in the Arctic Ocean. Numerous other federal permits were required before Shell could drill there, and by multiple accounts, Begich played a key role in pushing the administration from the time he began serving in the Senate.\nShell did drill in 2012 -- the first activity in that region of the Arctic in decades -- though after complications arose, including legal ones, the company hasn\u2019t done so again.\nSo Begich can rightfully take credit for helping advancing Shell\u2019s oil-drilling permits in the Arctic Ocean, but there\u2019s currently no drilling taking place.
