Last month, we estimated half of Tru McCarthy's allegation of shooting by the police in general under his command. In a recent television commercial, McCarthy once again quotes an extra four years in the command of the Chicago Police Department. \"You may not remember, but when I was the supervisor, the violent crime in Chicago was down, We had the lowest homicide rates in a generation, \"McCarthy says in the ad. \"How did we do that? :: A recent anti-gang plan that brings together community police and data to track gang activity. We met with families affected by gang violence and attacked the problem from the inside. As mayor, I will rededicate us to these intelligent principles and make Chicago safe again.\" In support of these allegations, he shows the reported news bulletins on the screen as he speaks. However, the articles highlighted do not fully reinforce McCarthy &apos; s allegations. First, an article in The New York Times entitled \"Killing a month is falling to 40 years in the city,\" published in 2002, nearly a decade before McCarthy arrived in Chicago from the East Coast. It refers to murders in New York City, not Chicago. This disparity has prompted us to look deeper into the rest of the Declaration. First, it is important to note that there is no such thing as a \"good\" homicide rate. One life is too lost. However, McCarthy &apos; s central hypothesis is that he has a record of making the gloomy account worse, bringing about a historic shift in the Chicago Police Department that left the city safer than it was years ago. In nearly two and a half years, McCarthy held the position of supervisor - 2013 and 2014 - the total number of homicides in Chicago fell to a level not seen since 1965, as the records of the department show. The problem is that those years were booked by two others under McCarthy's rule, where murders escalated. It should also be noted that an investigation into the Chicago magazine raised questions as to whether the manipulation of data led to the dropping of official statistics on murders in 2013 and 2014 at McCarthy's hour, an allegation which he objected to. It was the first full year of the McCarthy programme, respectively, in 2012. The critics at the time said that he was following closely his decision to dissolve large specialized teams of officers deployed to the swarms of the regions when the violence broke out and to prevent him from getting out of control. This surge continued in 2013 with a particularly deadly January, but after that, McCarthy basically re-established the strategy of his saturation team. Marco Rubio says on January 27, 2021, in his remarks, \"Only in the Third World do you see this routine use of trials of former leaders.\" This rate reflects the number of homicides in city records per 100,000 inhabitants, and since the population of Chicago is much lower than it was decades ago, the decrease in actual homicides does not necessarily translate into low record rates. The historical crime data compiled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation show that McCarthy would have been right - albeit not too much - if he had limited his claim to the lowest homicide rates in a generation to 2013 and 2014. The rates in these two years - 15.3 per 100,000 people in 2013 and 15.2 in the following year - were already lower than in the previous 28 years, but remained slightly below the rate of 15.5 in Chicago in 2004, when killings began a remarkable series of annual declines. However, in 2012, the McCarthy homicide rate was 18.5 per 100,000 residents, which is higher than in the years prior to his appointment. In 2015, when he was running the department for all but a few weeks, he jumped back to 17.5. The following year, with McCarthy gone, I jumped over 60% to 28.1. The data of the Federal Bureau of Investigation also show that the decline in urban homicide rates during the two years under McCarthy's rule was likely to continue a trend that began in the early 1990s and accelerated significantly in 2004. Other cities in the United States experienced similar reductions in violence within the same time frame. A McCarthy spokesman referred to a segment of the same FBI statements when we asked for an explanation of the candidate &apos; s allegations. However, the figures provided by the campaign reached only 2005 - barely the value of one generation and partially obscured the city &apos; s long-term decline. Our referee McCarthy said, \"We had the lowest homicide rates in one generation,\" referring to his strategy as a police supervisor to combat gang violence as a cause of descent. In two of the four additional years that McCarthy spent with the administration, homicide rates fell to a level not seen in decades. However, violent crime has been steadily declining in Chicago for years before, following a national trend. McCarthy also presided over more than two years when murders escalated, and critics at the time said that his anti-crime policies were at least part of the blame. His statement selects statistics and ignores the broader historical context of crime in Chicago. We mostly rate it wrong. In fact, this statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that give a different impression.
