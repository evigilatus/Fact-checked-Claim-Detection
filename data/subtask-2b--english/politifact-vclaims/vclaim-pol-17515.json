It was flagged as part of the company\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nWe found no evidence that Clinton wrote such an email to Brazile, who was the head of the Democratic National Committee in the fall 2016. Factcheck.org and Snopes debunked similar statements in 2019.\nEvidence-less memes showing Clinton going on a profanity-laced tirade started to circulate after Clinton and Trump were separately interviewed by NBC\u2019s Matt Lauer for a commander-in-chief forum in September 2016.\nNews reports showed that liberals and Clinton supporters felt Lauer wasn\u2019t tough enough on Trump.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.

The article linked to Politico\u2019s report headlined \"Liberals lash out at Lauer, NBC\" and then Victurus wrote:\n\"Hillary\u2019s meltdown included throwing a water glass at a staffer- narrowly missing her head, and demanding Matt Lauer be fired!\u00a0 She was overheard threatening executives at NBC saying \"If I lose, we all go down and that Fascist F--- will have us swinging from nooses! What the fuck is wrong with you idiots?\"\nPolitico didn\u2019t directly quote Clinton at all.\nVicturus Libertas also wrote, without evidence, that Clinton singled out Brazile during her rant.\nOur search of news articles did not reveal any evidence that Clinton sent a profanity-laced tirade to Brazile after the forum. We searched WikiLeaks\u2019 Hillary Clinton email archive and found nothing about nooses.\nThe post makes a ridiculous claim about Clinton\u2019s emails that isn\u2019t supported by any proof. We rate this statement Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17515"}
