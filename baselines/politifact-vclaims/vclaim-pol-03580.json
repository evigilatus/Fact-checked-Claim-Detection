Facebook users flagged the posts as being potentially fake, as part of the social media giant\u2019s efforts to stamp out fake news on its website.\nThe stories are all essentially identical, saying authorities stopped Obama (wearing a fake moustache!) as he was trying to fly out of Toronto\u2019s airport to an unspecified destination. He was allegedly taken back to Washington, where \"a court reporter who also moonlights for Breitbart\" secretly took the photograph.\nThe photo \"shows\" Obama\u2019s head clearly Photoshopped onto someone else\u2019s body. That someone is actually Robert Halderman, a former CBS News producer who in 2009 was accused \u2014 and later convicted \u2014 of attempting to extort late-night TV host David Letterman.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer CBS News producer Robert Halderman was arraigned in State Supreme Court in New York on Oct. 2, 2009, on charges of trying to blackmail late-night host David Letterman.
