Experts: Still no", "text": "Update 5:34 p.m.\nOkay. So, we\u2019re still talking about this.\nThere\u2019s a meme circulating on the internet that promotes allegations of voter fraud in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Florida. Our kinsfolk over at PolitiFact National\u00a0and PolitiFact Florida have already reported on claims specific to their states. For Pennsylvania, the meme reads, \"In 59 voting districts in the Philadelphia region, Obama received 100% of the votes, with not even a single vote recorded for Romney. (A mathematical and statistical impossibility.)\"\nThis kind of happened, and it\u2019s not actually mathematically impossible. First, the 59 refers to the City of Philadelphia, not the metropolitan area or region. An absolutely crucial fact: The 59 zones that saw no votes for Romney were not districts, but divisions. There are nearly 1,700 divisions in Philadelphia. Each of the city\u2019s 66 wards claims between 10 and 50 of them.\nTo provide a sense of how small divisions are, currently, the average number of registered voters per division is 616. The division out of the 59 with the lowest turnout counted 139 votes in 2012; the highest was 612.\nAs Billy Penn reported, after Sean Hannity reiterated that 59 divisions with all-Obama votes showed signs of election rigging, a West Philadelphia elections inspector took to Twitter to debunk it. The key nugget in his explanation was this: Votes cannot be subtracted from Philadelphia voting machines. Republican City Commissioner Al Schmidt confirmed that was indeed the case. So, if anyone had voted Romney, there\u2019s no way that vote could\u2019ve been removed from the tally, which means if fraud had occurred, it would\u2019ve had to have happened before the vote button was pushed.\nSome of the 59 divisions had fewer than 10 registered Republicans, according to records from April 2012. The average number of registered Republicans in these divisions was 17. The Philadelphia Inquirer sought out many of these voters after the election, and found that the rolls could use some updating. Some, neighbors said, had moved, others straight-up told the Inquirer they didn\u2019t know the city had them down as GOPers. One man told the paper while he was a Republican, he had never actually voted that way.\nExperts say these divisions reflect a trend of heavily Democratic inner-city neighborhoods. Considering how few Republicans live in these micro-neighborhoods, it\u2019s not shocking that Romney would have a tough go of it against the nation\u2019s first black president, in 59 subzones that only represented a mere 3.5 percent of the city\u2019s vote in aggregate.\nCommissioner Al Schmidt told Billy Penn last week that in order for there to have been voter fraud, by adding votes in these divisions would have required \"hundreds of people engaging in a conspiracy, and no one finding out about it.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo shows man upset because he was added to the no-fly list for storming the Capitol.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nOur ruling\nA viral image has called 59 Philadelphia voter \"districts\" counting zero Romney votes in the 2012 general election \"(a) mathematical and statistical impossibility.\"\nOnly, these divisions were not the size of districts. They were much smaller, encompassing hundreds rather than thousands, and in predominately African-American areas of the city.\nLooking at the voter records from six months prior, Democrats in these areas outnumbered Republicans more than 20 to one. That\u2019s before considering what the Inquirer\u2019s reporting suggests: That out of the small minority of GOPers in these sections, many don\u2019t align with the party, or don\u2019t appear to live there anymore.\nWere the 59 divisions worthy of investigation? Yes. And that happened in 2012, and has happened numerous times since.\nWe rule this claim a Pants on Fire.\n\u00a0\nAn earlier version of this story incorrectly cited PolitiFact Ohio.
