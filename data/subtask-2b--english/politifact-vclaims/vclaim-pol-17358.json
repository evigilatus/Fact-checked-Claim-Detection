In this case, those groups are Texas cities.\nThe per capita income is calculated by \"dividing the aggregate income of a particular group by the total population in that group.\" The final figure is rounded to the nearest whole dollar.\nIn 2018, the per capita income in Texas was $30,641. In the United States, it was $33,831.\nLooking at individual Texas cities reveals a wide range of values, from $65,743 in The Woodlands, a master planned community north of Houston, to $15,369 in Pharr, a city on the Texas-Mexico border east of McAllen.\nIn San Antonio, per capita income in 2018 was $24,684.\nSan Antonio is the second most populous city in the state (1.5 million), preceded by Houston (2.3 million) and followed in order by Dallas (1.3 million), Austin (964,254), Fort Worth (895,008) and El Paso (840,758), according to 2018 population figures.\n\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s the per capita income in 2018 in these cities, presented from highest to lowest:\n\nAustin: $42,923\nHouston: $31,162\nFort Worth: $29,010\nDallas: $27,729\nSan Antonio: $24,684\nEl Paso: $22,777\n\nAn analysis of the rankings of these cities each year from 2010 through 2018 shows that San Antonio is low on the list, followed by El Paso.\n\nAnother way to assess income in a community is to look at median household income or median family income. Median household income includes the income of the householder and anyone else living in the home over 15 years old.\nThis figure is different than median family income, according to the Census Bureau: \"Because many households consist of only one person, average household income is usually less than average family income.\"\nMedian family income looks at incomes of \"all members 15 years old and over related to the householder.\"\nIn 2018, the median household income in San Antonio was $49,024, lower than all of the six most populous Texas cities besides El Paso ($45,031).\nSan Antonio\u2019s median family income was $60,689 in 2018, a higher figure than Dallas ($58,835), Houston ($56,693) and El Paso ($50,245).\nPoverty in San Antonio\nCisneros made this claim after stating that San Antonio is \"a poor city,\" so we also looked at poverty data available from the Census Bureau for the 10 most populous cities in the state.\nIn 2018 in San Antonio, about 19% of its population was living below the poverty line \u2014 more than any of the other cities with populations over 500,000.\nTake at look at each city and the percent of its population below the poverty line, ordered from highest to lowest:\u00a0\n\nSan Antonio: 19%\nHouston: 18.2%\nEl Paso: 18.1%\nDallas: 15.7%\nFort Worth: 13.5%\nAustin: 12.5%\n\nAnother factor worth mentioning here is cost of living. San Antonio may be among the cities with the lowest per capita income, but the cost of living is also on the lower end.\nThe Economic Policy Institute\u2018s Family Budget Map shows an estimated cost of living for a two-parent, two-child family in counties across the state.\nHere is the cost of living per year in the predominate county in each city with a population over 500,000, in order from highest to lowest:\n\nAustin\u2018s Travis County: $80,766\nFort Worth\u2018s Tarrant County: $76,908\nHouston\u2018s Harris County: $73,010\u00a0\nDallas\u2018 Dallas County: $72,021\nSan Antonio\u2018s Bexar County: $71,278\u00a0\nEl Paso\u2018s El Paso County: $66,634\u00a0\u00a0\n\nOur ruling\nCisneros said that San Antonio has \"the lowest per capita income of any major Texas city.\"\nSan Antonio is among the six most populous Texas cities with the lowest per capita income. El Paso has consistently recorded a lower per capita income than San Antonio.\nWe rate this claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17358"}
