His comment during the democratic debate at the University of Wisconsin-Miloki in February was typical, shaking a list of problems with the health-care system in the United States: \"In America, we pay, to a large extent, the world's highest price for prescription drugs.\" We've asked Sanders for the source of his claim. We didn't get a response. So we searched alone. One of the organizations following these matters is the International Federation of Health Plans, based in London. The latest price report, effective 2013, lists eight common drugs. Compared to England, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland and Canada, United States prices were much higher, sometimes very much. Consider Nixium, a drug that is widely used to treat acid regression. The prescription, which will cost $60 or less in other countries, costs an average of $215 in the United States. That's just the rate. Prices vary considerably in the country: in 5 per cent of cases, the cost was $395. \"What Bernie says is true.\" \"There's no place to pay the same price as America,\" said Tom Sackville, CEO of the Federation. In addition, \"there is this huge price variation across America. Anything above average is completely unjustified. When you get to 95%, you're talking about grand theft.\" The results were similar in a study conducted in April 2013 and published in the Journal of Health Affairs, which examined the prices of branded medicines in the United States, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Germany, France, Canada and Australia. In each of the three years studied - 2005, 2007 and 2010 - United States prices have been consistently high. The only exception is Switzerland. In addition, researchers found that between 2005 and 2010, \"the gap between the United States and other countries seemed to be widening.\" It was not only new drugs that were first adopted in the United States that led to higher costs. They concluded that \"the prices of old products have risen faster in the United States than in other countries.\" However, Joel Farley of North Carolina University at Chapel Hill Pharmacology warned that the rule did not always apply to generic medicines. A 2008 comparison of 19 generic drugs showed that some prices in the United States were lower than those in Canada. \"In some cases it has to do with availability,\" he said. In other cases, the State may place the price of medicines low and in this fixed price market there is \"no incentive to fall.\" The Wall Street Journal published an analysis in December, which concluded that 98 per cent of the top 40 properties were the most expensive in the United States than in England. In Norway, the cost of 93 per cent of the highest 40 drugs was lower than in the United States. In Ontario, a comparison of 30 drugs showed that United States prices were also higher for 93 per cent of products. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 On January 11, 2012, why is the price of a trade name so much lower in other countries, and why is there a great variation in the United States? Big customers can negotiate big cuts. Therefore, countries with social medicine have a lot of influence on the negotiating table, and experts have told us that. In the United States, hospitals, wholesalers and insurance companies are all engaged in their own negotiations. The Department of Veterans can - and is already negotiating - negotiate significantly lower prices. Under Medicaid, pharmaceutical companies are required to provide their medicines at a low price, as is the case for any of their regular customers. However, the medical care system has been prohibited by law from negotiating lower prices since 2006, which is a huge piece of the health care industry in the United States. (When Barack Obama was the first presidential candidate, he promised to remove the restriction of the Bush era, but then retreated in an attempt to get passage of the Affordable Care Act.) The pharmaceutical industry says that it needs extra income to pay for research to keep the new medicines that are most needed coming. But with everyone getting a deal, the Americans are funding that search for the rest of the world, the experts told us. Yet another way to look at this issue was said by Amitava Dasgupta, a clinical toxicologist at the University of Texas, Health Sciences Centre in Houston. The one-dollar billboard in the United States may cost only 20 cents in India, but this property is much more expensive for the average person in India because their income is much lower. He said, \"The United States supports research for the world.\" But I'm gonna look at that as a charity. Governor Sanders said, \"In America, we are paying, so far, the highest price in the world for prescription drugs.\" When it comes to branded drugs, which make the highest profit for the pharmaceutical industry, studies support Sanders' claim -- although it is not always on a drug-by-drug basis. In addition, price differences can be dramatic because the United States health-care system is extremely fragmented, and the law prevents medical care from using its market share to bargain for lower prices. We found a comparative study between the United States and Canada that found exceptions to generic drugs, where the profit margin is much lower and which constitutes a much lower share of spending on prescription drugs. But in balance, we assess his statement mostly true.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05424"}
