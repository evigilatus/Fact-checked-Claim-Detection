However, the Democratic Vice-President's candidate responded that the explanation did not meet the \"Nixon standard.\" Richard Nixon made tax returns when he was on probation, and Ken said, Ken often uses Nixon to invite Donald Trump to release his tax returns. In August, we checked Kane's statement where he said that Nixon announced his tax returns when he was running for president. We found this statement to be mostly wrong, because while Nixon announced his tax forms as President, he never did so while running for higher office in the country. This time, his word was very different, so we will not look at others. You can find Nixon's tax returns for the period 1969-1972 on the website of the Presidential Tax History Project, run by tax analysts, a non-profit organization based on church Falls specializing in tax matters. This group collected tax returns on the Internet for former presidents and presidential candidates from the main parties. Nixon &apos; s return was released in December 1973, one year after his re-election. At that time, the 37th President was involved in Watergate's scandal, and questions were raised as to whether there was also something wrong in tax files. Check the facts (Kirk Cox) was mentioned on January 13, 2021 in a speech. Virginia ranked lowest third of the states in the management of the COVID-19 vaccine. \u2022 On 20 January 2021, reports emerged that Nixon had been paying a small amount of federal taxes for several years, told us by Joseph J. Thorndik, a historian in tax analysts in August. In order to address the concerns that remain, Nixon has issued tax declarations to the public and to the Joint Tax Commission. Nixon was under the control of the IRS at the time, Thorndick told us. In April 2016, Thorndik wrote that the IRS review found Nixon owed approximately $500,000 in taxes and unpaid interest. Nixon made his petitions even though he was under review. In the end, the audit wasn't good for him -- it was unpleasant, embarrassing, and ultimately very expensive, Thorndick's books. But it was also necessary, given the constant questions about Nixon's return. Thorndick says that Nixon's revelation has begun a tradition whereby presidents and candidates seeking the highest position release their returns to the public. His successor, President Gerald Ford, did not announce his returns, although he issued a summary of his return. Every president since Jimmy Carter has made their tax forms public. Our governor, Ken, said, \"Richard Nixon issued tax returns when he was under surveillance.\" That's accurate. We value his claim right. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/07d727d8-606f-4b56-b78f-9f6d0491142", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04208"}
