Scott Walker went back to creating jobs and painted an optimistic picture of how Wisconsin was doing. To work on explicit criticism from the democratic rival Mary Burke that his administration failed to achieve his rejection. One campaign promised to add 250,000 jobs from the private sector, Walker comparing Wisconsin with other Middle West states. In the ad, state lines appear on the screen while Walker speaks directly to the camera: \"Well, the latest job numbers are in Wisconsin and create jobs in the private sector more than Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Iowa, Ohio, and Illinois. That means we're third in the Midwest.\" With Burke's claim over and over again that Wisconsin is the \"dead last\" in job creation in the Midwest, we thought it was time to consider both allegations. As with Burke &apos; s claim, many factors are under way, including the time frame and the scale used. About Walker's numbers don't say that to the camera, but accurate print on the screen says that the advertising claim is based on the U.S. Labour Statistics Office (CES) current employment statistics for the period July 2013 to July 2014. It speaks of the last one-year period, not of his entire term. Wisconsin added 36,100 jobs in that one-year time frame, which places him third among the 10 Central Western states, behind Indiana and Michigan. Here's how the picture looks: as of July 2013-14, countries ranked private sector posts in the national ranking of jobs added to one. (India) 66,300 Michigan 58200 11. Wisconsin 36,100 4 Minnesota 3600 21. Ohio 29,900 26 Illinois 28,700 On January 12, 2021, in our speech, \"We put $330 million in public school aids - the largest in more than a decade.\" By Haley Bemler \u2022 January 26, 2012, 8 Iowa... 15,200... 900... Nebraska 4,200 45 10 In contrast, Walker used the preliminary data in July 2014, which will be modified in one month. An official of the Bureau of Labour Statistics said that it was reasonable to compare that figure to July 2013, with a warning that the July 2014 figure would change. Behind the figures is an accurate but important observation: in his claim, Walker uses the raw number of jobs created as a measuring stick - not an increase in the percentage, which is the measure favoured by economists. The use of the percentage change allows for a better comparison, owing to the different size of the mandates. That is, smaller states like South Dakota and Nebraska Waywa have fewer people and a smaller economic base to start from. It should be noted, however, that even on this scale, Wisconsin has outdone economies and larger populations such as Ohio and Illinois over the past year. And when the growth rate is used, Wisconsin just drops a little bit -- to the fourth highest in 10. Another point that we should consider, which is also important, is the use of Walker's monthly job data. These monthly figures are derived from a survey of 3 per cent of government businesses. It is thus subject to major revisions and contains a wide margin of error. Walker himself called the quarterly employment and wage census, which is based on a census of 96 per cent of employers, the \"golden scale\" of jobs. Shortly after he took office, Walker issued an e-mail statement in March 2011 stating that the Governor would use quarterly data because of his \"commitment to use verified actual job accounts, not just monthly job estimates.\" However, in the new announcement, Walker indicates that he uses monthly estimates this time -- he refers to \"newer\" figures, which extend until July 2014. In contrast, more accurate quarterly data are six months late. The most recent quarterly data end in the last quarter of 2013. The spokesman for the Ally Mar campaign told us that timeliness was one of the factors in the campaign &apos; s use of monthly figures. We believe it is possible to defend its use to provide insight into the latest trends. It is regularly used and reported by economists and news outlets. In our special programme Walk-O-Meter, as we track progress towards Walker's pledge to work in the private sector for 250,000 jobs, we use solid quarterly job numbers from 2011, 2012 and 2013 to provide the best picture of the first full three years of Walker State. Then, to give an idea of the latest images, we use the latest monthly job numbers. Our latest census shows 187,147 jobs to go. We've evaluated the promise well. Finally, Walker defined Midwest as 10 states -- the same states that Burke used in her claim. The Regional Office for the Middle West of the Bureau of Labour Statistics covers those 10 states, which usually refers only to the 10 states. In some cases, the Agency adds two more - Missouri and Kansas. Wisconsin ranks fourth out of 12 in the number of raw jobs added per year. The new Walker TV ad says that the latest job numbers show that Wisconsin is the third in the Middle West over the number of jobs created. The number was checked using the measuring stick and the time frame chosen by Walker. Surely, the monthly figures he uses are not as reliable as the quarterly figures, which Walker himself called the \"Golden Standard.\" But using raw figures to measure the increase, instead of a percentage-based approach that rises to the level of the playground, Wisconsin gives -- and he himself -- a small push. We assess Walker's claim mostly true. The broken jobs claim that voters will hear a lot of job applications before the November 4 election. Here are five tips to separate the truth from fiction -- and publicity from physical evidence -- when it comes to the candidates and the numbers they use. Check the time frame: If the statement covers a short period, it can be a red flag of cherry selection data to find a good outcome. A longer time frame may be used to mask more recent changes. Check the data source: quarterly job numbers are more accurate than monthly, but also more outdated. There can be greater uncertainty about the recent announcement of monthly figures, as they are subject to revisions. Raw figures or percentages? If the claim is that the State will add more functions than State Y, the statement may have limited information value. Find growth figures for percentages that achieve equal opportunities among states of different sizes. Check the map: When the claim is \"best in the area,\" trust but verification. Are all relevant States covered? Audit of the sector: Most allegations focus only on the private sector, but sometimes biaseds will be added to public officials if they are appropriate for their purpose.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07365"}
