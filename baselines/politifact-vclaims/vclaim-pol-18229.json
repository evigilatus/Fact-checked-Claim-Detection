But that\u2019s not the date that went viral.", "text": "Specifics have been hard to come by in this pandemic.\nWe don\u2019t know how many people are infected, how fast the coronavirus is spreading or how long we may need to quarantine.\nSo the first study to project a date when each state\u2019s cases would peak drew a lot of interest -- especially since Wisconsin jumped off the virtual page.\nThe study, released March 26, 2020, said cases wouldn\u2019t peak in Wisconsin until May 22, 2020 \u2014 a month later than most states, and nearly two weeks later than any other state in the nation.\nThe date went viral. News outlets across the state picked it up, and one writeup of the story from Madison365.com received nearly 40,000 comments, reactions and shares on Facebook in a day.\nAnd then the study changed.\nAn updated analysis posted four days after the original study moved Wisconsin\u2019s projected peak by almost a month to April 26, 2020.\nSo what\u2019s up with the shift? Which date is right?\nThis post, when the study offered a May peak, was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nHere\u2019s what we found.\nThe original study\nThe analysis from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation \u2014 an independent research center based at the University of Washington \u2014 developed a model projecting coronavirus growth across the United States for the next four months.\nIt projects deaths as well as a variety of measures of hospital utilization \u2014 beds used, intensive care unit days and ventilators days used. That estimate was based on COVID-19 deaths so far, data on hospital capacity and use and more detailed coronavirus hospitalization data available in some localities.\nThe institute estimates the pandemic would peak nationally around mid-April and result in more than 80,000 deaths, a summary of the study said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Steineke\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembly Republicans \u201chave come to the table\u201d and were part of \u201cgive and take\u201d compromise on a coronavirus bill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe state-by-state projections were based on a statistical model \u2014 essentially a detailed formula that projects the future virus spread based on death rates and other data available to this point.\nAnd those projections moved a lot after the initial release.\nThe update\nFour days after the original publication, on March 30, 2020, researchers added 1,730 nationwide deaths to the model and tweaked the methodology. They said the updates created more precise estimates\nThe updated projections changed the estimated peak for all but four states. Wisconsin moved the most, to 26 days earlier, but several others saw dramatic shifts as well. Maryland\u2019s estimated peak moved to 25 days later, Missouri to 21 days later and Idaho to 13 days sooner.\nAli Mokdad, a senior faculty member at the institute, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel the original model \u2013 started around the beginning of March \u2013 assumed Wisconsin would have a Safer at Home-style order in place about two weeks sooner than it did. Gov. Tony Evers issued the order banning all but essential services and travel on March 24, 2020.\nThe update factors in that actual date along with additional death data, which dramatically changed the model\u2019s analysis of the state.\nThe new projected peak for Wisconsin, April 26, 2020, is still later than what state health officials are saying. Wisconsin Department of Health Services Secretary Andrea Palm said March 30, 2020, the state expected the curve to begin flattening (i.e. peaking) in about 10 days.\n\"It\u2019ll be a couple of weeks before we start to really understand how well we are doing, social distancing, safer at home, to really judge ourselves against the worst case models,\" Palm said in a media briefing with\u00a0Evers and other officials. \"We really do believe it\u2019s another 10-plus days before we are going to be able to see evidence of a flattening off of the new daily cases.\"\nThe viral story from Madison365.com quickly updated to reflect the new numbers, so Facebook posts of that story shared before or after that update now show a headline that accurately references the new April 26 peak.\nInstead of being the latest peak in the country, Wisconsin is now right in the middle of the pack \u2013 tied for 20th-latest with three other states. The peak is two weeks after the projected national peak of April 15, 2020.\nOur ruling\nFacebook posts now circulating say Wisconsin will hit the peak for coronavirus cases on April 26.\nThat gives us an unusual fact check, since at the time most of those stories were shared, the post referenced a May 22 date that is no longer the best estimate from this study. But Facebook\u2019s design updates a linked story when the story is updated.\nWe aren\u2019t getting into whether this is an accurate model, since it\u2019s a prediction of the future and there\u2019s no way to say for sure. But we can examine the accuracy of the Facebook post itself.\nWhat is currently online in this viral post is an accurate reflection of the study, albeit one that requires a bit of extra context to understand the genesis of the current figures.\nWe rate this Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18229"}
