Now he says I should have closed it earlier.\"\u00a0\n\"I did not say either of those things,\" Biden responded. \"I talked about his xenophobia in a different context, not about closing the border to Chinese coming to the United States.\"\nAs debate moderator Kristen Welker interjected to ask another question, Trump continued: \"He thought I shouldn't have closed the borders. That's obvious.\"\nThis isn\u2019t accurate.\u00a0\nBiden did not directly say that he thought Trump shouldn\u2019t have restricted travel from China when he did. The former vice president did accuse Trump of \"xenophobia\" in an Iowa campaign speech the same day, Jan. 31, that Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar announced the administration's travel restrictions on people who were in China 14 days prior to their attempted entry into the U.S.\nBiden said: \"This is no time for Donald Trump's record of hysteria xenophobia, hysterical xenophobia, and fear-mongering to lead the way instead of science.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRELATED: Fact-checking whether Biden called Trump \u2018xenophobic\u2019 for restrictions on travel from China\nBiden\u2019s presidential campaign told the Washington Post Fact Checker that his accusations were not related to the travel restrictions, claiming he wasn\u2019t aware of the restrictions during his speech since the event started shortly after they were announced. The campaign also noted he made similar remarks in an opinion column published Jan. 27 in USA Today. And in his comments in Iowa, Biden did not mention the travel restrictions.\nOn Feb. 1, Biden mostly repeated his remarks from the campaign stop, tweeting: \"We are in the midst of a crisis with the coronavirus. We need to lead the way with science \u2014 not Donald Trump\u2019s record of hysteria, xenophobia, and fear-mongering. He is the worst possible person to lead our country through a global health emergency.\"\nBiden did not say whether he supported or opposed the Trump travel restrictions until April 3, when his campaign said that he supported Trump\u2019s decision to impose travel restrictions on China.\n\"Joe Biden supports travel bans that are guided by medical experts, advocated by public health officials, and backed by a full strategy,\" the campaign told CNN. \"Science supported this ban, therefore he did too.\"\nOur ruling\nTrump said, \"When I closed he said I should not have closed. ...He said this is a terrible thing, you are a xenophobe, I think he called me racist. Now he says I should have closed it earlier. \u2026 He thought I should not have closed the border. That\u2019s obvious.\"\nBiden didn\u2019t take an official position on the China travel restrictions until months after they were first enforced. And while he has called Trump a racist and xenophobic, those comments weren\u2019t explicity in reference to the travel ban.\u00a0\nTrump\u2019s claim contains an element of truth, but overstates and takes Biden\u2019s comments out of context.
