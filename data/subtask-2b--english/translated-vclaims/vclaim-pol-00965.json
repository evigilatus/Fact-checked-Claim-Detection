Is it true that farmers declare bankruptcy in record numbers? Historic data do not substantiate their claim What about the average income of farmers? The Gabriel tweet gives an incomplete picture. Experts said that it was too early to measure whether the commercial policies of management - regardless of their characteristics - were a factor in bankruptcy cases. National farmers' bankruptcy data do not support the historical bankruptcy data of Jabbard's claim for \"record\" statements among farmers. These are several types of bankruptcy procedures that people and companies can offer when facing financial difficulties or unable to repay debts. Chapter XII of the Bankruptcy Code, which applies directly to farmers, is the chapter that was created after an agricultural financial crisis in the 1980s. Chapter 12 allows family farmers and family hunters to reorganize their debts and continue working. Farmers must meet certain eligibility criteria for chapter 12, including a debt ceiling of approximately $4.15 million. (The debt line is updated every three years to adjust to inflation.) The bankruptcy court &apos; s data show the number of files submitted under Chapter 12 over a certain period of time. The data are not broken down by the number of files submitted by the fishermen and the number of files submitted by the farmers. But the experts told us it's safe to conclude that most farmers are farmers. However long we have considered, chapter 12 files are not at standard levels. In fiscal year 2018, the number of files submitted under chapter 12 was 468. This number is lower than in fiscal year 2017, when there were 508 files under chapter 12. In view of the above, there were 707 files in fiscal year 2010. Chapter 12 files in calendar year 2018 (498) were slightly lower than in 2017 (501) and less than several other calendar years. In the calendar year 2010, the number of files submitted under chapter 12 was 723. Chapter 12 files for the 12-month period ending June 2018 were also lower than in the same period in 2017. :: Researchers at the Ohio Polytechnic University have reported that farmers and fishermen, particularly those who exceed the debt limits of Chapter 12, can also apply for chapters 7 and 11 of bankruptcy. Therefore, chapter 12 bankruptcy is only a subset of all bankruptcy cases filed by farmers. However, even then, chapters 7 and 11 of the 2018 bankruptcy files were not the highest recorded. (It is not clear how many of them were farmers.) In November 2018, the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis stated that bankruptcy under Chapter 12 was on the rise in the Ninth District. The Fed analysis included files from Montana, South Dakota, North and Minnesota, Wisconsin. \"For the 12 months ending in June 2018, 84 agricultural operations in the 9th Prefecture states were offered for the protection of the bankruptcy of Chapter 12 - more than double the level seen in June 2014,\" said the Bank. It is unclear whether Jabbard &apos; s claim is based on the November report of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank - her team did not respond to our repeated inquiries. However, there is no single region in the United States that reflects \"national\" agricultural production, because different types of crops, agriculture/drying, and disciplines occur throughout the United States, as he said by e-mail, Annie Katchova, an assistant professor in the Department of Agricultural, Environmental and Development Economics at Ohio State University, and Robert Denterman, a post-doctoral researcher in the Agricultural Income Promotion Programme at Ohio State University. On January 13, 2021, bloggers announced the verification of the remarkable facts in a story in which General David H. Berger, the commander of the US Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for security, telling her \"We're not working for you.\" By Samantha Butterman, 17 January, 2021, in general, bankruptcy cases are not on record, and numbers do not support the stories of some major crises, as Ed Flynn, a consultant at the American Bankruptcy Institute, said. According to Jabbard's tweet, \"ficked and unconsidered trade wars\" in Trump caused farmers to declare bankruptcy in record numbers. However, policy - regardless of its characteristics - will generally not lead to bankruptcy in the near term, and bankruptcy figures alone are not sufficient to indicate that policy is the driver, as experts have said. Flynn said, \"Someone can look at the same data and turn it around to say that the bankruptcy rate is just a part of what it was 20 or 30 years ago.\" Jabbard tweeted the average income of farmers that \"the average income of agricultural households in the United States was - $1,548 in 2018.\" These formulations do not mention the whole picture. Farmers &apos; income usually comes from agricultural and external sources, and therefore the financial well-being of agricultural households is determined by income, according to the United States Department of Agriculture. Average farm income was expected in 2018 - $1,548 - a decrease from the average farm income of $800 in 2017 (in nominal terms, not adjusted). But the negative numbers in the 2018s are not unusual at all. \"In recent years, just over half of agricultural households have a negative farm income every year,\" said the US Department of Agriculture. However, many households depend on non-agricultural income (e.g. education, construction and health care sectors) and the average income has already increased from $67,500 in 2017 to $69,418 in 2018. According to the Ministry of Agriculture in November 2018, the average household income on farms is projected to be $76,594 in 2018. Without mentioning the non-agricultural income in its tweeting, Jabbard gives the misleading impression that the average gross income of farmers was negative in 2018. The U.S. Department of Agriculture said that households with most of their income from off-farm jobs are not affected by changes in agricultural costs and returns, as is the case with large commercial farms, but may be more vulnerable to changes in the wider economy. Negative farm returns can also reduce income taxes paid on non-agricultural sources of income, according to the Ministry of Agriculture. The fact that the farm has a net loss does not mean that the farm does not contribute to the well-being of the household, as reported in August 2018 by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. \"Farmers may suffer a net loss of farms in most years, but it is still economically rational to continue agriculture when macroeconomic returns are considered,\" the report said. \"For example, farms may have a net negative income from farms but expect significant long-term capital gains and use short-term farm losses as a tax write-off to increase revenue from other sources of income.\" Our governor Jabbard said that our farmers declared bankruptcy \"in record numbers\" and \"the average income for agricultural households in the United States was - $1,548 in 2018.\" The bankruptcy files are not at record levels. Chapter 12 files in 2018 were lower than in 2017 and in other recent years. The Jabbard formula for the average income of agricultural households is misleading. The average farm income was projected to be $1,548 in 2018. However, this does not represent the average gross income of farmers. Agricultural household income includes non-agricultural and agricultural income. The average household income on farms (outside farms and farms) in 2018 was expected to reach $76,594 in 2018. The Jabbard allegation contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that give a different impression. We mostly rate it wrong.
