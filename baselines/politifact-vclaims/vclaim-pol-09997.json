The Justice Department\u2019s website says Congress passed the law \"at the height of the civil rights movement in the South, a movement committed to securing equal voting rights for African Americans.\"\n\nIt\u2019s far from being old news, though. Texas is contesting two high-profile applications of the act, and the Supreme Court agreed Nov. 9, 2012, to rule on an Alabama case challenging Section 5\u2019s constitutionality.\n\nWe decided to look at the history.\n\nThe landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965, which has been renewed and amended over the years, took aim at several methods being used to prevent African Americans from voting. These included literacy tests that white election officials could administer as they saw fit, the Justice Department site says. Though the 15th Amendment made such practices illegal in 1870, in reality they were widespread.\n\nThe 1965 act specified that no \"tests or devices\" could be placed between citizens and their ballots, spelling out examples such as the literacy tests and providing for oversight by \"examiners\" and the U.S. attorney general.\n\nSection 5 required that certain jurisdictions -- states or smaller political entities that had recently employed such methods and had less than 50 percent voter participation or registration in the last presidential election -- must get federal preclearance for any changes in their election laws.\n\nThe same day that President Lyndon Johnson signed the act, according to a November 1965 report from the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, seven states and parts of two others were flagged by the U.S. Census Bureau and Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach because they had used literacy tests and fell below the halfway mark in voter registration/participation.\n\nTexas had never put a literacy test into its laws, according to the online education Texas Politics project at the University of Texas.\n\nKatzenbach told the Rotary Club of Houston in a Sept. 30, 1965, address, \"Voting discrimination is of general national concern, but it is not, by and large, a problem here. The use of federal examiners in Texas is neither needed nor contemplated.\"\n\nSo how did Texas get on the list?\n\nSmith told us he drew his information from a ruling in one of the state\u2019s current voting rights battles over election changes that were denied preclearance: the 2011 maps drawn for Texas\u2019 congressional and state legislative districts and the 2011 Texas law requiring voters to show government-issued photo ID.\n\nIn the voter ID case, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued an Aug. 30, 2012, ruling which, in its historical background, said the 1965 act\u2019s preclearance criteria were drawn up carefully to net the Southern states with the worst history of discrimination. \"In 1975,\" it said, \"Congress expanded the coverage formula to include jurisdictions that had substantial non-English-speaking populations but provided English-only voting materials at the polls.\n\n\"It was this change that brought Texas within the scope of Section 5\u2019s coverage.\"\n\nAnd it was proposed by a Texan: U.S. Rep. Barbara Jordan, D-Houston, the first black congresswoman elected from the South.\n\nAccording to a Congressional Research Service history of the act, the final form of the legislation in 1975 said that a jurisdiction would be subject to preclearance if it had low voter turnout/registration and also met both of these qualifications: 5 percent or more of its population spoke a language other than English, as determined by the U.S. Census Bureau, and the jurisdiction had conducted its Nov. 1, 1972 elections solely in English.\n\nIf that group of non-English speakers also had lower-than-average literacy in English, the jurisdiction would have to conduct bilingual elections, including ballots in both languages.\n\nOther states were affected, and Spanish was not the only language involved. Alaska and Arizona in their entirety, plus individual counties in California, New York and elsewhere, were now covered. As the U.S. population evolves and the act is amended or reconstrued, these continue to change; Houston\u2019s Harris County, for example, was required to provide election materials in Vietnamese as of 2004. The Census Bureau annually publishes a list of the jurisdictions falling afoul of the language requirements.\n\nSo that\u2019s what the 1975 amendment did. To learn whether Texas was drawn in because it didn\u2019t print ballots in English and Spanish, we sought the motivation behind the amendment -- and heard a range of reasons.\n\nFormer Texas Gov. Mark White, who in 1975 was Texas\u2019 secretary of state, told us by phone, \"It was all done to capture Texas.\" National advocacy groups such as the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund wanted to maximize Hispanic voters\u2019 power, he said.\n\nWhite argued the case for Texas in December 1975 when the state sued claiming it had improperly been subjected to Section 5. \"We passed in 1975 a Texas voting rights act which was stronger than the federal act,\" he said. \"I think we did everything we could do to let everybody in America know that Texas was not part of the Old South, which would exclude minorities from voting.\"\n\nMALDEF\u2019s vice president for litigation, Nina Perales, told us by email that Congress reached its decision after much testimony about discrimination against non-English speakers.\n\nThe testimony, some from MALDEF, described a range of discrimination, Perales said: refusing to register voters, throwing away their ballots, intimidation and harassment that included firing Spanish-speaking employees who got involved in politics. On a broader scale, districts were redrawn or positions elected at-large to prevent Spanish speakers from winning office, she said.\n\nOne view we came across several times in our research was that Texas only escaped the preclearance terms in 1965 by the grace of Texas native President Lyndon Johnson, at whose direction the act was drafted.\n\nUniversity of Houston political science professor Richard Murray has voiced this view: \"It is not surprising that LBJ left his home state off the \u2018bad conduct\u2019 list,\" Murray wrote in a June 26, 2009, blog post for Houston\u2019s KTRK-TV. \u00a0By 1975, he wrote, U.S. Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas was eyeing a White House run and was persuaded by Jordan that extending the act to Texas and to Hispanic voters would earn him needed support from liberal and minority voters.\n\nThe archivist of Jordan\u2019s papers at Texas Southern University, Gary Chaffee, emailed us documents from a May 2011 exhibit he put together focusing on Jordan\u2019s Voting Rights Act work.\n\nIn a Feb. 26, 1975, press release headlined \"Representative Barbara Jordan Asks Congress to Extend Voting Rights Act to Texas,\" Jordan said:\n\n\"I know firsthand the difficulty minorities have in participating in the political process as equals. The same discriminatory practices which moved the Congress to pass the Voting Rights Act in 1965, and renew it in 1970, are practiced in Texas today.\"\n\n\u00a0\n\nSeparately, we found Jordan\u2019s Feb. 26, 1975, statement introducing the bill in a Congressional subcommittee hearing, in which she described instances of voter intimidation and harassment as well as language barriers.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBilingual ballots wouldn\u2019t fix everything, she said, but they were a start -- and offered a clear way to measure discrimination:\n\n\"Printing of Spanish registration forms and Spanish baIlots will not cure voting discrimination in the Southwest. I have incorporated the use of an English-only ballot as a \u2018test or device\u2019 because it is a readily identifiable, objective criterion the Justice Department can easily apply nationally.\"\n\n\u00a0\n\nUltimately, was Texas brought under the act because it failed to print Spanish ballots?\n\nWhite and Perales both told us that was not entirely accurate because of the 1975 amendment\u2019s three preclearance \"triggers\": 5 percent non-English speakers, less than 50 percent turnout/registration and failure to print bilingual ballots.\n\n\nOur ruling\n\nSmith said that \"about 40 years ago, the federal government placed Texas under the Voting Rights Act because Texas failed to print ballots in both English and Spanish.\"\n\nThe amendment made 37 years ago was intended to -- and did -- bring Texas elections under the Voting Rights Act. English-only ballots were a \"trigger\" alongside other conditions.\n\nWe rate Smith\u2019s statement as Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09997"}
