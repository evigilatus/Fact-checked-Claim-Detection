He also shouldn't say anything because it's divisive,\" Gidley said. \"And then when he doesn't say anything and can't say anything because the platforms have removed him, they say, 'Where's the President?'\"\n\nGidley\u2019s claim came as tech companies like Twitter and Facebook cracked down on Trump\u2019s and other accounts for spreading misinformation or extremist messages. Twitter permanently suspended Trump\u2019s Twitter account, which had millions of followers, for example.\nGidley\u2019s claim also came days after Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif. and a staunch defender of the president, wrongly claimed that Republicans had \"no way to communicate\" without Parler, a social media platform targeted to conservatives. PolitiFact rated Nunes\u2019 claim False.\nPolitiFact reached out to Gidley for comment, but we did not receive a reply.\nLeonard Steinhorn, a professor of communication and affiliate professor of history at American University who once worked as a speechwriter, said Gidley\u2019s comments made his jaw drop.\n\"There's a reason Theodore Roosevelt called the presidency a \u2018bully pulpit,\u2019 and that was because of the platform it gave him to communicate with the public and advocate for issues,\" Steinhorn said. \"That was way before television and radio.\"\nFormer congressional staffers who spoke to PolitiFact recently described many ways public officials can communicate with the public beyond social media. They can send out press releases or mailers, hold press conferences, and give interviews, to name a few.\nSteven Thomma, executive director of the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association, said that Trump can appear anytime in the White House briefing room and talk to reporters as he wishes, whether it be outside Marine One or with a smaller group inside the Oval Office.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"His remarks will be covered by the news media in any of those cases, including on camera, as well as streamed live via the White House web page,\" Thomma said.\nTrump can also sit down or phone in for interviews with major TV networks, mainstream news outlets and local TV and radio stations. Throughout his presidency, Trump regularly appeared for interviews on Fox News shows such as \"Fox & Friends.\"\n\"He can basically pick up the phone and talk to any journalist in the world,\" said Mary E. Stuckey, a professor at Penn State University who specializes in political and presidential rhetoric and political communication.\nSince Twitter banned Trump\u2019s account on Jan. 8, Trump has delivered remarks in Texas and gaggled with reporters, according to Factba.se, an interactive transcript website that tracks his public statements. He and other officials have put out official White House statements.\nHe also released a five-minute video Jan. 13 discussing the violent riot at the U.S. Capitol, when a crowd of Trump supporters stormed the building in an effort to overturn the election. The House impeached Trump for inciting the insurrection that same day.\nThe video was broadcast to Twitter and Facebook via the White House. Gidley, whose Twitter account remains active, shared it to his followers. (White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany\u2019s Twitter account is also active, although she did not share the video.)\nTwitter was founded in 2006. Facebook launched in 2004. But long before those platforms took off, presidents were communicating with the public successfully.\u00a0\nSteinhorn said Gidley\u2019s claim not only shows a \"misunderstanding of the way a president can communicate to the American people,\" but also a \"complete ignorance of our nation\u2019s history.\"\nAbraham Lincoln delivered the Gettysburg Address at a battlefield, Steinhorn said. George Washington wrote his Farewell Address in a letter initially published in a newspaper.\nMore recently, Franklin Delano Roosevelt used \"fireside chats\" to usher the country through the Great Depression, and Lyndon Johnson spoke to a joint session of Congress after Bloody Sunday in Selma, Alabama, Steinhorn said.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nGidley said Trump \"can\u2019t say anything (about the U.S. Capitol riot) because the platforms have removed him.\"\nThat\u2019s wrong. Trump has many tools available to him, including the ability to go on TV or call reporters to the White House briefing room. He has made public remarks since the riot.\nWe rate Gidley\u2019s statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19191"}
