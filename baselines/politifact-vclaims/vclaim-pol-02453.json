Paul Gosar asks police to arrest illegal immigrants at State of the Union", "text": "A Republican representative from Arizona contacted law enforcement in response to reports that Democrats planned to bring Dreamers, immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children, to President Donald Trump\u2019s State of the Union.\n\"Rep. Paul Gosar asks Capitol Police to arrest illegal immigrants attending State of the Union,\" stated the Jan. 30 headline on USA Trainnews, a right-leaning website.\nFacebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network\u2019s efforts to combat fake news. However, we found that the article correctly cites Gosar\u2019s efforts to summon law enforcement to arrest Dreamers.\nThe fate of Dreamers, which played a role in the January federal government shutdown, appears uncertain. In September, Trump announced that he was ending Obama\u2019s program that temporarily deferred deportation for certain illegal immigrants, prompting talks about how to come up with a permanent solution. A White House framework would offer a path to citizenship over 12 years in exchange for $25 billion for the border wall and other improvements, but members of both parties have raised objections.\nGosar, who was first elected to his Arizona district in 2010, received an A+ from NumbersUSA, a group that advocates for lower levels of immigration.\nGosar posted a few tweets from his U.S. House account at 1:33 p.m. Jan. 30, hours before Trump\u2019s State of the Union address:\n\"Today, Congressman Paul Gosar contacted the U.S. Capitol Police, as well as Attorney General Jeff Sessions, asking they consider checking identification of all attending the State of the Union address and arresting any illegal aliens in attendance.\n\"Additionally, Congressman Gosar asked that they arrest those using fraudulent social security numbers and identification to pass through security.\n\"Of all the places where the Rule of Law needs to be enforced, it should be in the hallowed halls of Congress. Any illegal aliens attempting to go through security, under any pretext of invitation or otherwise, should be arrested and deported.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJake Tapper\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in remarks in a CNN broadcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The second presidential impeachment of Donald Trump was \u201cthe most bipartisan impeachment in American history.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGosar\u2019s tweet drew criticism from members on both sides of the aisle on twitter.\nU.S. Rep.
