The Dec. 3 article carried the headline, \"Sarah Palin Calls To Boycott Mall Of America Because \u2018Santa Was Always White In The Bible.\u2019\"\nThe article quoted Palin as saying people should run the Mall of America \"into the ground,\" on the basis of Santa \"always having been white in the Bible,\" and, \"No, I refuse to believe that they went this far in trying to cater to the minorities, I thought the company had some backbone but I guess I was wrong,\"\nThe former Alaska governor and 2008 Republican vice presidential candidate never said these things.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoliticono.com, which calls itself a \"hybrid news/satire platform,\" takes real news hooks and builds fake stories on top of them. Every article has a \"show facts\" button to illuminate which parts of the story are real and those that are fabricated.\nWhen you click the \"show facts\" button on the Palin article, it highlights as fact the first paragraph, which is about the Mall of America\u2019s real decision to hire a black Santa. But the entire rest of the article, detailing Palin\u2019s supposed call to boycott the mall because of the Bible\u2019s teachings on Santa, is completely made up.\n\"Dear Democrats, this is what \u2018fake news\u2019 actually looks like, and I guarantee you no Trump voter actually fell for this,\" Palin wrote on Facebook Dec. 20, with a link to a Breitbart article debunking the Politicono.com post.\nPoliticano.com is more forthcoming than other fake news sites about the fact that it posts made-up content. But it\u2019s still not immediately apparent that its editors fabricated the story claiming Palin said she would boycott the Mall of America because Santa was always white in the Bible. So we rate this fake news article Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03848"}
