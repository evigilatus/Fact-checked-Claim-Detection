Rick Scott's corporate tax cut plan", "text": "Minutes after Florida Gov. Rick Scott finished delivering his first State of the State address, a trio of Democrats took turns rebuffing the new governor on everything he just said.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Nan Rich and House Minority Leader Ron Saunders came first in brief televised remarks, attacking Scott\u2019s plans to cut education funding and make teachers, firefighters and police officers take de facto pay cuts in order to contribute to their own retirement.\n\nThey were, in many ways, a warm-up act for former Florida U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, who used a national cable platform offered by MSNBC to excoriate\u00a0Scott's plans.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGrayson opened the interview on March 8, 2011, by answering a question about how Scott -- whose former hospital company Columbia/HCA pleaded guilty to 14 corporate felonies and paid $1.7 billion in fines -- could be elected governor in the first place. He said it was par for the course for Florida Republicans.\n\n\"The last head of the Republican Party of Florida was literally led away in chains and indicted,\" Grayson said, referring to deposed RPOF chairman Jim Greer.\n\nThen Grayson cracked a joke, saying Scott once refused to answer questions during a deposition by invoking his 5th Amendment constitutional rights 75 times. \"That\u2019s like pleading the 375th.\"\n\nGrayson closed the interview by criticizing Scott\u2019s plan to cut and eventually eliminate the state\u2019s 5.5 percent corporate income tax, suggesting education spending reductions are funding the corporate tax cut.\n\n\"He wants to eliminate the corporate income tax and cut corporate taxes in Florida by $1.5 billion,\" Grayson said. \"He wants to cut funding for the schools by $1.5 billion.\n\n\"He\u2019s taking money out of children\u2019s pockets dollar for dollar so he can stuff it in his own.\"\n\nWe knew we\u2019d find a fact check among all the one-liners. We wanted to see if Grayson\u2019s shrewd ledger work is right: Does Scott\u2019s budget reduce education funding by the same amount he would cut\u00a0corporate taxes?\n\nThe numbers are fairly easy to find, it turns out.\n\nScott\u2019s budget proposal for 2011-12 reduces the total amount of state K-12 education funding from $18.2 billion, to $16.5 billion -- a total cut of $1.7 billion. That number includes local property taxes the state mandates school boards collect (the required local effort), the state contribution from sales tax revenues and trust funds, and money passing through the state from the federal government.\n\nThe cuts break down this way (we\u2019re rounding a bit, so everything might not add up exactly):\n\n* The state\u2019s contribution would decrease by about $11 million, but remain largely the same, about $8.9 billion.\n\n* Required local education taxes would shrink by about $660 million, and discretionary local taxes would shrink an additional $200 million -- shrinking the local contribution from about $8.4 billion to nearly $7.5 billion.\n\n* And the state also would not replace about $873 million in federal stimulus funds.\n\nOn the other side of the ledger is Scott\u2019s proposed cut to the 5.5 percent corporate income tax. The tax is exactly what it sounds like -- it\u2019s paid as a percentage of the incomes of Florida businesses. Florida already has one of the lower corporate tax rates in the country, but Scott has made eliminating the tax a priority.\n\nAs part of his 2011-12 budget, Scott proposes reducing the tax rate to 3 percent. His office says the reduction will save corporations $460 million. Put another way, the cut will trim state revenues as part of the 2011-12 budget by $460 million.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t take an Ivy League mathematics degree to figure out that the numbers don\u2019t begin to line up the way Grayson suggests. The tax cuts represent $460 million, which is less than one third of the $1.7 billion education cut.\n\nPart of the issue might be Scott\u2019s budget proposal is actually for two years -- 2011-12 and 2012-13. Over two years -- after factoring in a second reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 3 to 2.5 percent -- corporations would save a total of $1.5 billion, according to the governor\u2019s office.\n\nBut that\u2019s not being fair -- $1.5 billion over two years doesn\u2019t exactly compare to $1.7 billion over one year.\n\nIn reviewing Scott\u2019s tax-cutting proposals, it appears Grayson\u2019s error also could have been singling out the corporate income tax as a way to cast Scott as a greedy CEO-type looking out only for his buddies.\n\nAs we said in a previous item, Scott is proposing a total of $1.7 billion in tax and fee cuts as part of his 2011-12 budget. Scott\u2019s proposal includes cuts to the corporate income tax, a cut to required school district property taxes, and a cut to unemployment taxes. PolitiFact Florida has previously ruled that roughly half of those cuts apply only to businesses, while half apply to homeowners and typical Floridians.\n\nLook at the numbers -- a total of $1.7 billion in tax and fee cuts in 2011-12 versus a proposed total education funding cut of $1.7 billion. They match (well, they\u2019re not identical, because of rounding).\n\nAnd there\u2019s one final way to look at this. The corporate income tax is estimated to collect about $2 billion in the current budget year. If it\u2019s eliminated, a goal of Scott\u2019s, that would be $2 billion less the state would receive. That\u2019s on the order of the $1.7 billion K-12 education Scott is proposing for 2011-12.\n\nBut again, that\u2019s comparing additional budget years beyond even 2012-13 to cuts coming this year.\n\nOn MSNBC, Grayson targeted Scott\u2019s proposal to cut the corporate income tax, suggesting the cuts for corporate CEOs are being paid for on the back of students. While he\u2019s right that any tax cut results in money not available to be spent on programs like education, he gets his numbers wrong.\n\nIf Grayson had said the tax cuts and fees being proposed by Scott are being paid for by education cuts, he\u2019d have more of a point. But sticking to what he said, we rate this claim Barely True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEditor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.
