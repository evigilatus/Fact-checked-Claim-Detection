It didn't", "text": "On the day a gunman killed 11 and wounded six others in a Pittsburgh synagogue, President Donald Trump twice defended his decision to hold a scheduled campaign rally by pointing to a rapid reopening of the New York Stock Exchange after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.\nIt did not happen the way he described.\nTrump first mentioned this rationale in an Oct. 27 address to the Future Farmers of America conference in Indianapolis:\n\"I remember when we had the attack in Manhattan. We opened that stock exchange the next day; people were shocked. A great group of people \u2014 the head of the New York Stock Exchange is just a fantastic guy \u2014 Dick (Grasso). And he opened it up.\"\nLater that day, Trump kept his promise to hold a rally in Murphysboro, Ill. He repeated the anecdote in that address:\n\"With what happened early today, that horrible, horrible attack in Pittsburgh, I was saying maybe I should cancel both this and that (the speech in Indianapolis). And then I said to myself, I remember Dick Grasso, a friend of mine, great guy. He headed up the New York Stock Exchange on Sept. 11. And the New York Stock Exchange was open the following day. He said \u2014 and what they had to do to open it, you wouldn't believe. We won't even talk to you about it, but he got that exchange open. We can't make these sick, demented, evil people important.\"\nHere\u2019s what really happened.\nThe New York Stock Exchange didn\u2019t open on the morning of the attacks, which hit the World Trade Center a few blocks away.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe exchange building wasn't directly damaged, the Associated Press reported at the time, but \"the surrounding neighborhood was littered with debris.\"\nThe stock exchange didn\u2019t open again until Sept. 17, 2001. Even a week after the attacks, conditions were hardly normal.\nAt that point \"rescue workers continued to search for survivors amid smoldering rubble,\" the AP reported, and \"the smell of smoke still (hung) in the air \u2014 even permeating the NYSE trading floor.\"\nTrump does accurately remember Grasso\u2019s involvement. \u00a0\nAs he rang the opening bell on Sept. 17, Grasso said, \"Today, America goes back to business. We do it as a signal to those criminals who inflicted this heinous crime on America and all Americans, they have lost.\"\nAccording to the New York Times, \"traders took subways instead of limousines, trudged on foot from the Staten Island Ferry, and began lining up at 7:30 outside the exchange to have their bags searched and ID tags checked.\"\nThe White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article.\nOur ruling\nTrump said he didn't cancel a political rally because after the 9/11 attacks, \"the New York Stock Exchange was open the following day.\" It wasn\u2019t; the exchange didn\u2019t open until a week later, on Sept. 17.
