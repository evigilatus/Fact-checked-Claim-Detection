Over 300K home owner suicides attributed to foreclosures. Why won't anyone defend these American property owners' rights?\"\nHave there really been 300,000 suicides linked to foreclosures? We decided to take a look.\nWe first checked with the group credited with creating the meme -- a news and opinion site called occupycorporatism.com -- but an email to the site\u2019s general inbox was not returned.\nSo we next checked annual death statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The most recent report came out in December 2013, covering statistics for 2010.\nFor 2010, CDC found that suicide was the 10th most common cause of death, with 38,364 cases. Here\u2019s the number for the past nine years:\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nYear\n\n\nSuicides\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2010\n\n\n38,364\n\n\n\n\n2009\n\n\n36,909\n\n\n\n\n2008\n\n\n36,035\n\n\n\n\n2007\n\n\n34,598\n\n\n\n\n2006\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyan Fournier\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Noah Y.

But for\u00a0the meme to be correct, you\u2019d have to believe that every single American suicide between 2002 and 2010 was caused by a foreclosure.\u00a0\nOf course, that assumes there was a reliable way to measure this kind of causal effect. (The CDC reports don't address what caused a person to commit suicide.) And the meme is even further off-base it it intends to be referring only to suicides since 2008.\nWe asked several experts whether the meme's claim was even remotely possible.\n\"There is no basis for this claim,\" said Douglas Massey, a population-research professor at Princeton University.\n\"It isn't plausible that every suicide over a nine-year period could be attributed to foreclosure,\" agreed Janet M. Currie, a Princeton University economist who, along with Erdal Tekin of Georgia State University, has studied the health impacts of the rising tide of foreclosures in the United States. Tekin expressed similar skepticism when contacted by PolitiFact.\nIn their own research, Currie and Tekin found that a location with about 400 foreclosures in a year might see 24 more medical visits for mental health conditions, including suicide attempts. But that wouldn\u2019t be enough to support the meme\u2019s claim, Currie said.\nOur ruling\nThe meme said that over 300,000 homeowner suicides are attributable to foreclosures. But that would mean every suicide over a nine-year period would have been caused by a foreclosure, and experts say that\u2019s not credible.
