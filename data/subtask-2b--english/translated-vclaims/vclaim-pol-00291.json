But while Trump often talked about \"invasion\" on the border, he wasn't \"talking about the extermination of the Latins,\" Wallace was responding to a note from the guest and columnist Raul Reyes, who said that Trump's use of the words \"invasion\" and \"invasion\" could make some people want to exterminate. \"With the invasion, the natural conclusion is the attempt to exterminate,\" said Reyes. In comparison, Wallace referred to how President George W. Bush (who served as her contact manager) served Latin voters, and President Barack Obama tried to move forward with immigration reform with input from Latin leaders. \"Now you have a president, as I said, who talks about the extermination of the Latins,\" I followed. The next day, Wallace apologized for observing Twitter, saying that it was \"a mistake to speak.\" (MSNBC refused to comment.) I misspoke in Trump's invitation to exterminate the Latins. My mistake was unintended and I'm sorry. In fact, Nicole Wallace (@NicolleDWallais) 7 August 2019, but Sarah Matthews, Deputy Press Secretary of the Trump Campaign, told us that \"many will hear more on the air than her apology.\" Here's the point: Trump often accused immigrants of invading the United States, but he never spoke of \"extermination of the Latins.\" Unless Tramp Trump says, no copy of the word \"extermination\" has been used to describe Latinos, Hispanics or immigrants in the United States or on their way to the United States. We checked Google and Nexus, and we didn't find any examples. The search for the President &apos; s Twitter account has not yielded any results. We have also seen the interactive website Factba.se, which tracks public statements and tramp tweetes. According to the Factba.se database, Trump mentioned extermination only in reference to the Holocaust or ISIS attacks on Christians or Americans. He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. By Bill McCarthy: January 12, 2021, Trump said while Trump did not call for \"extermination of the Latins,\" he repeatedly used the words \"invasion\" and \"invasion\" to curb the flow of migrants across the southern border. Montage CNN shows that several times dates back to November when Trump referred to an invasion of the border in public statements. During the May gathering in Panama City, in Fla, Trump expressed regret, \"How did these people stop? You can't do that.\" When a contestant yelled, \"Shoot them,\" Trump pointed to the crowd, shook his head, shook him, and said, \"This is just in Panhandle you can get away with that statement.\" Trump also used the word \"burn\" or a copy of it in at least 10 tweets since the launch of his 2016 presidential campaign. In addition, his campaign has posted more than 2,000 advertisements on Facebook since January, containing the word \"invasion,\" according to The New York Times. We have verified some of Trump &apos; s allegations relating to the invasion. Similarly, Trump used various forms of the word \"celebrating\" in at least eight tweetes dating back to the beginning of his campaign in 2016, usually referring to the alleged presence of a gang that said it corrupted cities of refuge where undocumented migrants could not be prosecuted or deported. More examples can be found of the president speaking of an invasion or invasion on Factba.se. Trump was also shot by critics for using the word \"animals\" when talking about immigrants and members of the MS-13 gang, and for saying, referring to the violent white rally in 2017 in Charlottesville, Virginia, \"You also had very good people, on both sides. The Democrats after the election campaign and other critics of the President said that his speech was echoing on a website that might be linked to the El Paso Killer. According to the Washington Post, the statement appears to be paranoid about the so-called Spanish invasion, but says that the shooter's beliefs predate anything Trump said. The Governor Wallace said Trump was talking about the extermination of the Latins. Trump often described the influx of migrants as \"invasion\" and the siege of \"infested\" areas of the country. But he didn't say anything about \"extermination of the Latins.\" The context of the interview concerned words and their meaning. If Wallace wants Trump to be held responsible for what he said, we have to do the same for her. We're assessing this statement with pants on fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00291"}
