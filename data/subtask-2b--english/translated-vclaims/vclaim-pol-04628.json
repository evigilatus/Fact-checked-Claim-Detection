On the last night of the Republican National Congress, Trump placed himself as the financial opposite of the contested and assumed democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, who claimed to be proposing to raise taxes. \"Middle-income Americans and businesses will suffer deep relief, and taxes will be largely simplified for everyone, I mean everyone,\" said Trump. America is one of the countries with the highest taxes in the world. The reduction of taxes will cause new companies and jobs to return to our country. Believe me, it will happen and it will happen quickly.\" This is the fourth time we've studied a report from Trump on the tax rate in America. The difference tonight is a little moderate tone. Instead of declaring that the United States had the highest tax rate, he said that we were among the highest tax countries. This is progress. But it's still 100 percent inaccurate. In May, Trump said, \"We are the highest tax nation in the world.\" We assessed this error because, according to the Pew Research Center last year, America is a little behind the mid-group when it comes to the share of taxable revenues in GDP. Raj Shah, spokesman for the National Commission of the Republic, told Politi Fact that Trump was talking about the rate of corporate tax. Trump did not identify this distinction in his speech, although his claim regarding the tax price was immediately followed by the business line on tax reduction that would stimulate the growth of new companies and jobs. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 On January 11, 2021, we previously validated a statement on whether the United States had the highest tax rate of companies in the world, and found it to be highly accurate. Among the world &apos; s most developed and industrialized countries, America ranks third in the highest overall marginal income tax rates for companies, with Chad and the United Arab Emirates exceeding 39.1 per cent of the corporate profits tax. Therefore, the United States has a higher tax rate for companies than most of its industrial counterparts. However, it is worth remembering that official tax rates are one thing, while corporate tax rates can actually be much lower. In practice, United States companies pay less because they can claim deductions and exceptions. Trump linked his statement to the tax impact on \"Middle-income and business Americans,\" which could easily lead listeners to consider this as a matter of public tax burden, not business in particular. Our classification of Trump called the United States one of the world's high-tax countries. Trump changed his language this time in an attempt to improve his accuracy, saying it was \"one\" from the highest tax countries. If you think it means the corporate tax rate, given the details of companies and post-claim jobs, Trump's suspension is very precise. However, this distinction has not been defined, and a reasonable listener can take Tramp &apos; s observation that he means taxes in general, especially since he has drawn the line with a common reference to middle-income Americans and businesses. We assess the claim mostly wrong. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c8860395-ac6d-4568-be87-4971393facb", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04628"}
