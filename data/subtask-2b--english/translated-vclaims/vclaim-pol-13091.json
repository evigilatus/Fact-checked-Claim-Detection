Scott Walker was about to escalate. The shopkeepers were informed that activists were planning a campaign on 1 May to slap posters on several products to express anti-Walker sentiment. Other media have picked up the story of the 27 April Sentinel newspaper of the Assembly &apos; s warning, including some media that took another step - saying that trade unions were behind the poster threat. One day later, Phil Newenfeldt, President of the Association in Wisconsin, responded with a statement that he said in part: \"We have no knowledge other than the unproven assurances given to the media by the Wisconsin Association for bulldozers about any such campaign, but let us be absolutely clear -- there is no, and there has never been, any province encouraged by our organizations.\" The second part of that statement drew our attention. In the wake of the Collective Bargaining Act, didn't trade unions increase pressure on businesses - including M&I Bank and Kwik Trip - where executives or political action committees supported Walker or GOP groups? Let's stop and look at the definition of the dictionary for the province: \"Refraining or working together to refrain from using or buying or dealing with it as an expression of protest, displeasure or as a means of coercion,\" says the free dictionary. Similar definitions exist for others such as Merriam-Webster.com and Alevial Consumer.org. We asked Newenfeldt about his statement, given the anti-walker activities that were on the news. Response: This is not an official ICAO boycott. In fact, very few of these districts have taken place. The reason for this, as Newenfeldt said, is simple: such actions by the parachute group of workers are illegal under federal law. He said, \"We're not interrupting.\" \"We can't.\" This looks so dry and dry. But is it really? In fact, the State of AFLI-CIO is a university group. However, it includes about 1,000 affiliated local unions, representing 250,000 members of the state. The Newenfeldt statement was \"there is no, and there has never been, any province encouraged by our organizations.\" This appears to include member unions, which are permitted by law to participate in provincial processes. Furthermore, the statement applies not only to the organization of the province, but also to its \"censorship.\" So, let's move on to the record. For example, there's a Facebook page \"Boycott Scott Walker Contreurs,\" which contains over 23,000 people and businesses - including some unions representing firefighters, police officers, teachers - that's the most important part of the world. Newfield said these are individual actions and are not coordinated by the umbrella working group. At the same time, members of the Wisconsin Federation of State Employees, Council 24 of the Federation, urged businesses to put signs in their windows that supported workers &apos; rights. A letter sent to companies saying in part: \"Failure to do so will leave us no choice but to make a general boycott of your work.\" Subsequently, the Federation leaders rejected this effort as an act of the \"hardening\" local union. What about the same A.F.A.M. stuff? At a press conference on May 5, outside the branch of M&I Bank on the west side of Milwaukee, the group said that it had withdrawn $105,000 from the bank and closed its account as part of what it called the \"Move Malik\" campaign. The group withdrew its funds to protest the contributions of executives to M &amp; As in Walker and to emphasize the risk to Wisconsin &apos; s jobs that might come from the future sale of M &amp; As to the Bank of Montreal. M & I was listed among dozens of businesses on the Facebook page \"Boycott Scott Walker.\" Looks like the FBI wants you to take your job somewhere else. Isn't this a county? The University of Wisconsin-Madison, Professor of History, William Paul Jones, expert in organized work, disagrees. He said: \"Technically, the county is an organized business,\" while the withdrawal of money from M&I by the state of AFLI-CIO is an individual business. Under federal law, the existence of coercion constituted a major threshold for considering a protest or action to be a boycott. For example, the AFL-CIO can say: we do that, and we hope that it will follow our example. They misunderstand federal law if they set picket lines and try to prevent customers from entering and so on. Perhaps the most famous province was the one organized against grape farmers in 1965-70, a nationwide effort that led to the creation of united farm workers. This district was not considered illegal and resulted in the signing of a contract with farm workers. The Federal Act expressly prohibits the \"secondary\" province - such as actions taken against a supplier of spare parts linked to a strike against a car manufacturer. At the end of the day, there was no group poster, which prompted the original warning from the Grickers League and the Newenfeldt Ward. The CEO of the Grosers League said Brandon Schulz had heard from a store in the north where he asked a client to leave because he thought he had posters with him. Schultz said the media's attention might have been to turn the protestors off. But as we noted, the Newenfeldt statement was much broader than talking about the poster threat. Making it more serious made it more problematic. Noinfeldt said, \"There is, and has never been, any province encouraged by our organizations.\" It is noted that the group throughout the state is prohibited by federal law from carrying out operations in the province. However, his statement also applies to the organizations of the Freedom Alliance in the states, not only regulating the province, but also encouraging it. It is clear that trade unions are taking action to support the provincial anti-waker movement. In fact, the Association called for a press conference to show the public that it was taking the step of some of its member groups withdrawing funds from M&I. Moreover, the ordinary person does not view the issue from a legal perspective, but rather the practical result. They see Union members protesting Walker and listing the chain of fuel stations, the sausage maker and a lot of other businesses on the Facebook county page. We appreciate that Newenfeldt's statement is hardly true. Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" By Haley Bimler: January 26, 2021 Editor's Note: This statement was estimated to be barely correct when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name of the evaluation to most of the error.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13091"}
