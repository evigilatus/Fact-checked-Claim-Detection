In late May, she revealed a plan requiring employers to disclose wage data, subject to a fine if they did not pay their workers on an equal basis, regardless of gender. A few days after the presentation, Harris showed up on a \"late show with Stephen Colbert.\" During the interview, Harris discussed her efforts to promote equal pay. Here's an exchange from May 22, starting from about two thirds of the way through a passage: \"Harris: The law says that men and women should be paid equal pay for equal work, but what we know is that women in America today receive on average 80 cents on the dollar that men receive for the same work. African American women, 61 cents on the dollar, Latina 53 cents on the dollar. These are in fact not debatable points.\" Colbert: \"So these aren't working hours, on average. This is an hour for an hour.\" Harris: \"Yes, and for the same work. Or it could be the annual salary, but it's the same job.\" The Harris figures for African-American and Latin-American women are correct, as long as these groups are compared to white and non-Spanish-born men who work full time and throughout the year, a distinction that Harris has not identified. However, there is a greater problem with Harris - women charge 80 cents of what men are paid for \"the same work.\" In short, Harris wrongly explained the meaning of the gender pay gap. 80% is not a comparison between apples and apples for men and women performing the same work. Instead, it refers to the average wage for all jobs occupied by men and all jobs held by women. When we contacted Harris' campaign, they quickly realized that Harris had misspoked, even after he was holding on to Colbert's point. His spokesman, Ian Sams, pointed out that Harris' plan did not use the \"same work\" formula. The most recent official data on this point, published by the United States Census Office in 2017, showed that women earn 80.5 per cent of what men have done. This percentage has increased by two percentage points in recent years, although it has not changed significantly between 2016 and 2017. On January 18, 2021 in the Committee &apos; s discussion. \"The United States is the only modern industrial State that does not already have a paid family medical leave programme.\" Although 80 per cent may be used to refer to some aspects of the challenges faced by women in the workplace - such as disproportionate representation in fields that provide more flexible work schedules, even if this means less income - statistics cannot be used to determine wage discrimination between men and women who perform the same work. How much is discrimination? Other studies have shown a much closer correspondence between men and women in the same jobs. For example, a study conducted by the American Association of University Women in 2013 revealed a pay gap between men and women of 7 per cent after a year of college graduation. This is still uneven, but it is about one third the size of the figure that Harris cited in her tweet. \"The adjustment of workers' working hours narrows the gender gap below the one mentioned by Sean Harris,\" said Gary Portless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. \"Adjusting to the age of workers, educational attainment, and years of work experience also slightly reduces the gap. Further adjustments to the labour industry, the occupation and the size of the employer reduce the gap further.\" While professional choices can be shaped to some extent by gender, \"We don't know how much discrimination \"grazing\" is there,\" he said. It should be noted that the wage gap varies according to industry. For example, women who work as cooks earn about 91 per cent of what male cooks earn, but women who work in retail sales earn only 74 per cent of what their male counterparts earn, according to the Women &apos; s Policy Research Institute. In an article on the place of work in fact.com in May 2019, the economist Martha Jimbell cited research indicating that \"the occupational and industrial differences between men and women account for about half of the gender wage gap because men are more likely to work in higher-paid occupations.\" Our rule, Harris, said, \"In America today, women on average charge 80 cents of what men are paid for the same work.\" 80 per cent of all working women &apos; s wages are compared to all working men, and it is therefore wrong for Harris to describe them as a comparison between women and men performing the same work. Research has shown that there is a wage gap between women and men performing the same work, but it is smaller than 80 cents on the dollar. We're mostly assessing the statement wrong.
