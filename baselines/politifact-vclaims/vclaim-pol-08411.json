Marco Rubio, R-Fla.\nIn an interview with Rubio on CBS\u2019 Face the Nation, host Bob Schieffer pointed out this approach resembles the optional Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. Right-leaning leaders in several states rejected federal money to cover more residents through the federal-state program.\n\"What if these states opt out of these programs?\" Schieffer asked.\nObamacare is different, Rubio replied.\n\"Well, here\u2019s the distinguishing factor. Under Obamacare, when you turn Medicaid over to the states, what you're saying to them is, the money will be available up front for the expansion for a few years,\" he said. \"Then, the money will go away, but you get stuck with the unfunded liability. I\u2019m not saying we should do that.\"\nIs Rubio correct about the federal money for expanding Medicaid going away after a few years?\nSomewhat.\nThe Affordable Care Act aimed to expand access to health insurance for the nation\u2019s uninsured residents. The architects of the law envisioned an expansion of Medicaid in each state to cover low-income adults up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level, which in 2013 was $15,856 for an individual or $26,951 for a family of three in 2013.\nThe Supreme Court ultimately upheld the law as constitutional, but justices struck down the mandatory Medicaid expansion. That left it to state leaders to decide whether to offer more residents coverage through the jointly administered program.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

On the other side, 26 states including the District of Columbia are implementing the expansion in 2014, and two states will move ahead with an expansion after the first year.\nFor conservative governors in Ohio, Michigan and Arizona, the deal offered by the federal government to expand was too good to pass up.\nThe federal government will cover 100 percent of the cost of adding new adult Medicaid beneficiaries from 2014 to 2016.\nThe federal government will scale down its payments to 95 percent in 2017, 94 percent in 2018, 93 percent in 2019, and 90 percent in 2020, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\nThe 90 percent level is permanent. States will not have to shoulder more than 10 percent of the cost after that, unless Congress passed a law to change the ratio.\nOur ruling\nRubio said, \"Under Obamacare, when you turn Medicaid over to the states, what you're saying to them is, the money will be available up front for the expansion for a few years. Then, the money will go away, but you get stuck with the unfunded liability.\" His office did not respond to us.\nThe federal government will only pay 100 percent of the costs of expanding Medicaid for three years starting in 2014. But Rubio leaves a misleading impression with viewers that all of the money just goes away. The federal government plans to bring down its share to a permanent funding level of 90 percent.\nRubio's statement contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.
