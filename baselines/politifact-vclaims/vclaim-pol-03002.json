Tolerating bigotry in silence is no virtue; taking it on is.\"\nThe ad discusses an event that actually happened but distorts reality. We\u2019ll explain why.\nHere\u2019s what happened at the forum\nOn July 18, six mayoral candidates gathered in the City Council chambers to participate in a mayoral forum moderated by St. Petersburg\u2019s League of Women Voters.\nThe forum had a unique format that didn\u2019t allow for debate.\nSome questions were addressed to all six candidates, and other questions were only addressed to half of the panel. If a question was only addressed to half of the panel, then a candidate who was not asked could wave a \"wildcard\" to signal that he or she wanted to answer the question. Candidates were given three wildcards and were told that there would be no opportunities for rebuttals.\nFor the first 30 minutes, the forum went on without a hitch. That changed when Congemi used his wildcard to respond to a question about how to provide recreational activities for youth in the city. The question was only addressed to Theresa \"Momma Tee\" Lassiter, Kriseman, and Jesse Nevel, national chairman of the Uhuru Solidarity Movement, which helps\u00a0organizes white support for black-led community social justice.\u00a0\n\"Mr. Nevel, you and your people, you talk about reparations,\" Congemi said. \"The reparations that you talk about, Mr. Nevel, your people already got your reparations. Your reparations came in the form of a man named Barack Obama.\"\nAmid boos from the crowd, Congemi added: \"My advice to you, my advice to you, if you don\u2019t like it here in America, planes leave every hour. Go back to Africa, go back to Africa.\"\nKriseman was seated next to Congemi. As Congemi talked about reparations, Kriseman can be seen with sealed lips, looking around. Another angle shows Kriseman glancing at the crowd and then looking at Congemi during parts of his outburst.\u00a0\nVIDEO: Paul Congemi, cand for mayor of @StPeteFL tells activists in debate their \"reparations were Barack Obama\" and to \"go back to Africa\" pic.twitter.com/QlSmDhGAPw\u2014 Evan Axelbank Fox13 (@EvanAxelbank) July 19, 2017\n\nAfter Congemi\u2019s remarks the crowd continued to bellow in opposition and Nevel called Congemi a \"nonfactor\", but it settled after candidate Anthony Cates III, who is African-American, used his wildcard. He did not address what Congemi said, talking instead about a charity he worked with that helped students.\nAfter Cates spoke, the moderator asked all six candidates how they would approach the homeless population. Kriseman was the first to answer, and he didn\u2019t mention Congemi.\nKriseman said his administration had invested money to help family homelessness in the community.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDebbie Wasserman Schultz\n\n\nstated on January 9, 2011 in comments on NBC's 'Meet the Press'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays the person who Florida U.S. Rep. Allen West first hired as chief of staff told people attending a Tea Party rally that, 'We will use bullets if ballots don't work.'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Aaron Sharockman \u2022 January 10, 2011\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe question then went to Lassiter and Nevel, who also didn\u2019t mention what Congemi said (though Nevel did dismiss him as a \"nonfactor\" in the midst of Congemi\u2019s rant).\nHowever, when it was Baker\u2019s turn to talk, he called out Congemi.\nTo reiterate my comments at the debate last night. I reject Mr. Congemi's offensive remarks. They have no place in the public discourse. pic.twitter.com/sqZ4wPLRLR\u2014 Rick Baker (@bakerstpete) July 19, 2017\n\n\"I know we\u2019re not supposed to respond to other things, but I first have to specifically reject the comments Mr. Congemi just made,\" Baker said. \"I just think in 2017 in St. Petersburg, Florida, I never would have dreamed\u00a0we would've heard comments like that at a mayoral debate.\"\nThat night, Twitter erupted with video of Congemi\u2019s remarks, and the Washington Post wrote about the situation early the next day.\nA little past noon on July 19, Kriseman rejected the racist remarks on Twitter, Facebook, and in a television interview.\n\"It is simply unacceptable to spew this kind of bigoted rhetoric,\" he said. \"Free speech should not compromise the dignity and respect of any person or community\"\nHe said he didn\u2019t want to bring more attention to the remarks at the time, adding that he regretted not speaking out then and there.\n\"I was reluctant to engage this candidate last night and draw even more attention to his disturbing message,\" Kriseman wrote on Facebook. \"I regret not doing so, though.\"\nI was reluctant to draw even more attention to his disturbing message. I shouldn't have been. https://t.co/cCMHH5oGXV https://t.co/XuRrhsMfn3\u2014 Rick Kriseman (@Kriseman) July 19, 2017\n\nCongemi\u2019s last runs for mayor only garnered a few hundred votes. In 2009, Congemi referred to homosexuality as an \"abomination\" and spoke out against the St. Pete Pride festival.\nKriseman\u2019s campaign said he has a long record of standing up against discrimination and pointed to his record of denouncing President Donald Trump's\u00a0decision to ban transgender people from serving in the military as well as his proposal during the campaign to ban Muslims.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nA television ad paid for by Rick Baker\u2019s PAC said he condemned racist comments from another candidate while Kriseman \"just looked away.\"\nBaker did speak up during the mayoral forum. In doing so, he acknowledged that he was going against the organizers\u2019 rules by not sticking to the question at hand and revisiting earlier comments.\nKriseman did not comment on what Congemi said that night. Neither did four other candidates at the forum. Kriseman waited until the next day, and was criticized for it. He said he did not want to bring more attention to the message in the moment but regretted not doing so.\nThe admaker misleads viewers by neglecting to include Kriseman's later condemnation of what Congemi said.\nThis ad is partially accurate but omits substantial information about what happened.
