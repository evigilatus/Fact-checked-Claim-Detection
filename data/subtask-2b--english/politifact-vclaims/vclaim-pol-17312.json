(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\n\nA screenshot of a viral tweet shared to Facebook that wrongly claimed to show the CDC's COVID-19 survival rates.\nThe age-specific \"survival rates\" listed in the post did not come from the CDC, however. CDC spokesperson Jasmine Reed told PolitiFact that the agency has not released any age-specific COVID-19 survival rates, nor does it have mortality rates available.\n\"Survival analysis is highly complex,\" Reed said. \"CDC does not have the data to calculate survivability for COVID-19. Unclear as to where social media users are getting this information.\"\n\"We don\u2019t have that data, so we don\u2019t know,\" added Cindy Prins, an epidemiologist at the University of Florida. \"And neither would the person who posted (the tweet).\"\nSketchy sourcing\nThe tweet didn\u2019t cite a specific CDC source for its \"COVID-19 survival rates.\" PolitiFact tried to reach Jimenez through messages to her Conservative Latina Twitter and Facebook accounts, but we did not hear back.\nThe figures line up with parameters included as part of CDC planning scenarios designed to help public health agencies model the impact of the pandemic.\u00a0\nIn a September document labeled \"COVID-19 Pandemic Planning Scenarios,\" the agency listed five sets of parameters that represented different levels of disease severity and transmissibility, with the goal of helping public health agencies make models to estimate the effects of the virus.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 25, 2021 in a blog post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWHO now saying you do not need to wear a mask.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe infection fatality rates listed under the scenario marked as the \"current best estimate\" correspond with the \"survival rates\" listed in the tweet. But those infection fatality rates, the document says, are based on data through Aug. 8. And there are other caveats.\nLead Stories debunked a Facebook post citing the same scenarios to wrongly claim that the CDC had downgraded the severity of COVID-19 to something less than the flu.\u00a0\nThe CDC document says the scenarios \"are not predictions of the expected effects of COVID-19\" and \"do not reflect the impact of any behavioral changes, social distancing, or other interventions.\" It also says \"uncertainty remains around nearly all parameter values.\"\nThe tweet also ignored the toll a seemingly small fatality rate can take when a disease spreads unchecked. Johns Hopkins University puts the observed case fatality ratio \u2014 calculated as the number of known deaths divided by the number of confirmed cases \u2014 at about 1.8% for the U.S. At that rate, if every American got COVID-19, there would be almost 6 million deaths.\nDoctors have gotten better at treating the disease since the outbreak of the pandemic, PolitiFact reported. But the numbers of new COVID-19 cases and deaths reported each day in the U.S. have skyrocketed in recent weeks. \"Excess deaths\" remain above historical norms. The risk of severe illness from the coronavirus increases with age, the CDC says.\u00a0\nSurvival rates are hard to estimate\nIn a pandemic, it\u2019s difficult to nail down data points like survival rates, Prins told PolitiFact. Such rates are usually calculated for a longer period of time rather than as a snapshot.\n\"Deaths and reporting of deaths lag behind the identification of new cases, sometimes for months, so we never quite catch up with knowing who has \u2018survived\u2019 unless we set a time period that we\u2019re looking at, like we do with five-year survival rates in cancers, or the disease goes away and we can look back at the pandemic as a whole,\" Prins said.\n\"In addition, we know that there are side effects of COVID-19 like myocarditis that may show up well after \u2018recovery\u2019 but could cause death at that later time, so both survival rates and mortality rates are more accurate after some time has passed.\"\nA widespread vaccination effort would prevent more deaths, protect people from severe illness, slow the spread and put the U.S. on a path back to normal.\nOur ruling\nA tweet said\u00a0\"CDC COVID-19 survival rates\" are 99.997% for people ages 0 to 19, 99.98% for people ages 20 to 49, 99.5% for people ages 50 to 69, and 94.6% for people over 70.\nThe CDC has not released survival rates, and it doesn\u2019t have the data to do so. It\u2019s not clear where the tweet\u2019s numbers came from, but they correspond with figures listed as part of CDC \"planning scenarios\" used for planning a pandemic response.\nWe rate this post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17312"}
