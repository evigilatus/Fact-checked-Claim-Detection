Jay Nixon made the rounds on the Sunday political talk shows on Aug. 17 to discuss the ongoing turmoil in his state stemming from the death of Michael Brown, an 18-year-old black man shot and killed by a white St. Louis suburban police officer.\nIn addition to discussing the reaction from the community and law enforcement agencies, Nixon was also grilled on his own response to the outcry.\nOn This Week, Martha Raddatz told Nixon, \"People are angry with you, personally. Your press briefings have been town halls, people venting their anger, wondering where you were early on. I know you issued statements after about 72 hours, but you didn't come to the scene for five days. What responsibility do you bear?\nNixon replied: \"Well, I mean, I've been here almost every day.\"\nWe decided to review Nixon\u2019s timeline for the last 9 days.\nMichael Brown was shot by police officer Darren Wilson around noon on Aug. 9 in Ferguson, Mo., and was pronounced dead at the scene. Tension in the community built and reached a crescendo the evening of Aug. 10, when a vigil for Brown was overtaken by an angry protest and looting.\nWe asked Nixon\u2019s office to provide his schedule for the following days. Spokesman Scott Holste told us in an email, \"The governor has made public appearances over there on Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday, or five of the seven days since the initial unrest a week ago Sunday night.\" While some details from those days were provided, his full schedule for the week was not.\nWe pieced together Nixon\u2019s schedule ourselves based on Holste's email,\u00a0news reports, press releases from his office and his Twitter account, which often documents his travels.\nThere were no tweets or releases about Ferguson on Aug. 10. There was one release from his office that day \u2014 an op-ed about mental health.\nOn the morning of Aug. 11, after a night of chaotic protests and a standoff between the community and Ferguson police, Nixon formally requested for the Justice Department to independently investigate Brown\u2019s death.\nOne hour after tweeting out that release, Nixon\u2019s account posted a picture of the governor addressing Missouri \"conservationists and sportsmen.\"\nOn Aug. 12, Nixon appeared at events for El Dorado Springs and Chadwick public school to announce funds to expand early childhood education.\nLater that day, he announced on Twitter that he was, \"joining faith & civic leaders @ Christ the King United Church tonight in north St. Louis county #Ferguson.\"\nNixon, along with the Ferguson police chief and mayor, spoke at a packed Christ the King United Church of Christ. He gave brief remarks to the standing-room crowd, about 465 words, according to a transcript posted on his official website.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in remarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s where things get technical. When questioning Nixon, Raddatz quizzed him on why he \"didn't come to the scene for five days.\"\nThe church\u00a0event wasn\u2019t held at the scene. Nor was it in the same locality. Instead, the church was about 4 miles from where Brown was shot in the bordering city of Florissant.\nAt this point, Nixon had not visited the location where Brown was shot, and vigils and protests were being held all day and night. And he wouldn\u2019t visit the scene or Ferguson\u00a0until two days later, on Aug. 14. \u00a0\nOn Aug. 13, he toured a Joplin, Mo., high school re-opening three years after it was destroyed by a tornado and he later met with children from 4-H and Future Farmers of America.\nThat night, Nixon announced that he was canceling plans to attend the Missouri State Fair on Aug. 14 and would instead go to Ferguson.\n\"Closely monitoring situation & will be in North STL Co tomorrow. Ask for calm & urge law enforcement to respect rights of residents & press,\" his account tweeted.\nEvery tweet sent from Aug. 14 through his appearances on the Sunday morning shows are related to Michael Brown and the Ferguson shooting.\nBeginning Aug. 14, Nixon also spent time each day in Ferguson. The morning he arrived he visited a local church and later a makeshift memorial, according to his Twitter feed.\nThe next day Nixon had security\u00a0briefings and held a press conference in Ferguson with Capt. Ron Johnson of the State Highway Patrol, whom Nixon tasked with keeping the peace there.\nOn Aug. 16, he held a press conference to announce a curfew in front of a contentious crowd of demonstrators.\nAs for why he delayed, Nixon told Bob Schieffer on Face the Nation that \"these problems have to be solved at the local level,\" but he chose to take greater action \"when I saw the military vehicles rolling up, when I saw guns pointed at kids.\"\nNixon spoke with Schieffer and Raddatz from St. Louis on Aug. 17.\nOur ruling\nWhen Raddatz said Nixon hadn\u2019t visited the scene of Brown\u2019s death for five days, Nixon replied, \"I've been here almost every day.\" Brown was shot Aug. 9 and violence broke out Aug. 10. Nixon first visited a nearby city on Aug. 12, but he didn\u2019t visit Ferguson until Aug. 14.\nWhile Nixon was active early \u2014 calling for a federal investigation the morning after a standoff between protesters and police and attending the nearby community meeting \u2014 there is a distinct and noticeable shift in Nixon\u2019s activities starting Aug. 14.\nPrior to that date, Nixon kept up\u00a0his schedule and continued to make appearances unrelated to the Ferguson shooting. After that date, he held daily press conferences and meetings near the scene of the crime, visited the location of the shooting, and made no other official public appearances.\nIn all, he was in Ferguson for three days from Aug. 10 through Aug. 16, all toward the end of the week. Given the evidence and the parameters of Raddatz\u2019s question, Nixon\u2019s statement is Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07429"}
