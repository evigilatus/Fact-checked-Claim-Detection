Instead, it would bring in kosher meals from outside \u2014 bringing food over from a sister nursing home, catering meals or offering prepacked dishes.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers wanted to keep nursing homes\u2019 kosher kitchens open. They asked for $600,000 in supplemental funding, an extra $5 a day per kosher diner.\n\n\"We in the Legislature felt that a nursing home resident that was observant was entitled to that, even in tight fiscal times,\" said Rep. Ruth Balser, D-Newton, who helped work on the measure. \"... People were definitely alarmed, and we took it very seriously.\"\n\nRomney used his line-item veto to scratch the funding, writing that \"it unnecessarily requires an increased rate for nursing facilities,\" the Jewish Advocate reported.\n\n\"I guess the governor at the time thought it was supplementary or an optional expense we couldn't afford,\" Balser told PolitiFact. \"... \"It was his intention to cut them off.\"\n\nBut Democrats, who held a majority in the Massachusetts Legislature, \"overrode it quickly,\" Balser said. Nursing homes got their funding.\n\n\"It never came up again, that I'm aware of,\" Balser said.\n\nNeither Burton nor Balser could confirm that any Jewish nursing home residents lost access to kosher food, nor did we find any other information suggesting that kosher meals were ever eliminated for the nursing home residents.\n\nOur ruling\n\nGingrich claimed that as governor of Massachusetts, \"Romney cut off kosher meals for Jewish senior citizens who were on Medicaid to save $5 a day.\"\n\nIt\u2019s true that one Massachusetts nursing home said in 2002 that it would close its kosher kitchen. But that decision was made based on a state funding decision before Romney took office. And that nursing home still planned to offer kosher meals to its residents \u2014 just not from an in-house facility.\n\nIt\u2019s also true that when lawmakers rallied to provide money to make sure nursing homes didn\u2019t have to make that choice, Romney attempted to veto extra funding, saying it would boost nursing home rates. But his veto was quickly overridden. There's no evidence any senior citizens were denied kosher food.\n\nWe rate Gingrich\u2019s claim Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11673"}
