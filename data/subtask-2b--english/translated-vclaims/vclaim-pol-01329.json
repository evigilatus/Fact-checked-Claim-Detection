It indicates that the Democratic Party uses the agenda of the Socialist Party in the 1940s. He claims that Thomas, in his 1944 speech, said: \"The American socialist people will not knowingly adopt. But, under the name \"liberal,\" they will adopt every part of the socialist program, until one day America will be a socialist nation, without knowing how it happened.\" The Mema goes on to quote Thomas: \"I no longer need to run as a presidential candidate for the Socialist Party. The Democratic Party has adopted our programme.\" Thomas was a Minister, a social worker, a peaceful and productive writer and co-founder of the American Civil Liberties Union. He's run for president six times. \"If you're not afraid, you're not listening.\" Facebook writer, Vincent Schmucky, says (in all hats), \"Everything was part of their plans to take America!\" This article was referred to as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The Poletti fruit newspaper often investigates whether famous people actually speak the words attributed to them. In this case, lack of evidence indicates that the answer is no. We found a lot of places on the Internet that used to quote, but no one mentioned a verifiable source. Many say that it comes from Thomas's talk in 1944, although it does not offer any day or place. Another says that during an interview in 1948, it was during one of Norman's presidential campaigns but, again, without any indication of where the interview was published. Ronald Reagan, 20 years before he assumed the presidency, used the first part of the quotation in Radio 1961 attacking medical care as social medicine and confirming that Norman said so in 1927. The author of the autobiography Regan Le Cannon, editor of the State Gazette Net Capital Journal, wrote in \"Governor Reagan: rise to power,\" that the quote was one of his favorites. \"This is the suspect quote, and Reagan didn't give any reference to it,\" books of Cannon. Facebook was published on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook video showing the man upset because he was added to the no-fly list to break into the Capitol. By Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 11 January 2021 \"If Thomas says this, I couldn't find proof of it, Reagan told me in 1968 that he didn't know her origins,\" said Cannon in a footnote. \"Thomas often said, however, that both major political parties borrowed items from the Socialist Party's program, including social security\" More than that, Cannon said, \"Reagan was vulnerable to using false quotations in his letters because he pulled many things out of newspapers where such quotations were frequent.\" One example cited by Cannon is a fake quote from Alexis de Tocqueville for America's finest. In the 2003 CV, Cannon stated that \"By the 1960s, the deep peaceful Thomas was more social democracy than the socialist, and the United States was not very close to \"socialism.\" Two of Thomas' most famous autobiography have died: W.A. In 1992, at the age of 84 and Harry Fleischmann (a prominent socialist per se and the author of Norman Thomas: a biography) in 2004 at the age of 90. Our attempts to track Thomas' autobiography, Raymond V. Gregory, despite the failure of his publisher. We also sought a quote in some of Thomas' online writings, including, \"How the Socialist Party can best serve socialism\" (1949), \"Behind the Christian Front\" (1939), \"Democracy against dictatorship\" (1937), \"Why I am Socialist,\" (unpaid). None of them were quoted. The same applies to Thomas' profile in 1961: \"Norman Thomas: respected rebels.\" Finally, we contacted the New York Public Library, which has a collection of Thomas's writings filling the equivalent of 193 boxes. Thomas J. Lannon, assistant director of manuscripts, archives and rare books, wrote that among the texts taken from radio programmes and backward speeches from 1944, the quote in Mimi Facebook cannot be found. In fact, there are many speeches in which Norman Thomas proposes that the socialist people vote until election day, November 7, 1944. Before the November 1944 elections, many, if not all, of his speeches were against the two-party system. The idea that Norman Thomas would have said that the Democratic Party had adopted the Socialist Party platform is inconsistent with all the texts of the speeches that still exist from those given by Thomas in 1944.\" So someone -- anyone -- can provide evidence that the quote came from Thomas, we're assessing this false message. Update: This story was updated after publication to include a comment from Thomas Lannon at the New York Public Library. The evaluation has not changed.\"", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01329"}
