Adam Schiff has drawn conservative fire for his role in the impeachment hearings, and a recent Facebook post attempts to tie the California Democrat to the late Jeffrey Epstein, the financier accused of sexually assaulting underage girls.\u00a0\nIn a photo published on Facebook on Nov. 24, Schiff appears to be sitting cozily on a couch with Epstein.\u00a0\n\"Apparently they were buddies,\" the poster wrote. \"Which one is (was) the most sleazy?\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.
