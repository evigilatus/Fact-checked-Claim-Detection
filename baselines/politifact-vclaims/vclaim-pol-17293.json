The post includes a picture of Schnedlitz and an inset picture of a can of Coca-Cola and what is purported to be a COVID-19 rapid test device.\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nWe found that the politician did conduct the test on a kit meant for testing blood samples for the presence of COVID-19 antibodies, and he said it yielded a positive result. But Dialab, the Austrian company that makes the rapid tests, said that happened because Schnedlitz didn\u2019t handle or execute the test properly. Guidance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for similar rapid tests supports Dialab\u2019s explanation.\nSchnedlitz\u2019s test\nSchnedlitz posted a video on his Facebook page showing him dabbing a swab into a glass with a dark liquid and then gently tapping that swab on a COVID-19 rapid test device. Minutes later, he lifts the testing device and says that there is a positive result (according to YouTube\u2019s auto-generated English captions of his speech in German).\nThe caption for the Dec. 10 video (translated from German to English by Facebook) said: \"Today I did a corona test live in Parliament. The corona mass tests are worthless! This also showed a simple experiment in Parliament where a Coke got a positive result!\" Schnedlitz\u2019 post argued that the government was wasting taxpayer money on the tests.\n\"Today I proved in Parliament how moronic the government's corona mass tests are,\" Schnedlitz said in a follow-up Facebook post, according to the translated version.\nDialab says Schnedlitz did the test wrong\nWhile Schnedlitz may have gotten a positive result, his conclusion about the tests isn\u2019t supported, Dialab said, because his method was wrong. Had the test been conducted properly, the result would have been negative, Dialab said in a Facebook post, according to Facebook\u2019s German to English translation.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne error Schnedlitz made is that he did not add a buffer to the Coke \"sample\" before testing it. \"In a properly executed test, the sample is always swirled first in a liquid (buffer) that keeps the pH constant,\" the company wrote.\nCOVID-19 tests should also be conducted by hospital staff or people trained to administer them, Dialab said. Dialab\u2019s Facebook post included a video of a test on a sample of Coke \u2014 treated first with a buffer \u2014 and it yielded a negative result.\nDialab on its website lists its COVID-19 testing products, including the type used by Schnedlitz. That type of test seeks to detect COVID-19 IgG and IgM antibodies in serum, plasma or whole blood samples.\nPolitiFact reviewed instructions for some COVID-19 IgG and IgM rapid tests that have been given emergency use authorization by the FDA in the United States. Those instructions call for the use of a buffer in the testing procedure. That aligns with Dialab\u2019s explanation of how its test works.\nOur ruling\nAn Instagram post said, \"Austrian parliamentary member Michael Schnedlitz just exposed the defectiveness of the government\u2019s Covid-19 tests by demonstrating how even a glass of Coca Cola will test positive for Covid-19.\"\nSchnedlitz did place a sample of Coke on a rapid test for COVID-19 antibodies and said it tested positive. But the company that makes the test said that isn\u2019t surprising \u2014 because Schnedlitz didn\u2019t do the test correctly. He left out a key step that would have yielded a negative result.\nSchnedlitz proved not that the testing device is defective, but rather that he did the test incorrectly.\nWe rate the Instagram post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17293"}
