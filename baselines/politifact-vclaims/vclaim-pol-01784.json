Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., was \"busted\" for routing millions of tax dollars into the pocket of her husband, business investor Joseph Shepard.\nAffordable housing projects in which Shepard has invested have received millions in federal subsidies during McCaskill\u2019s two terms in office.\nBut this headline spins the narrative in a way that could mislead readers \u2014 by making Shepard\u2019s business success appear more nefarious than what has been reported.\n\"Shock report: Senator McCaskill busted funneling millions of tax dollars to her hubby,\" said a July 25 headline from Patriot Beat, a conservative website. The story quoted directly from a Breitbart News article, which in turn cited original reporting from the Kansas City Star.\nThis story was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\"Well, well, well, with a tight election coming up, Senator Claire McCaskill does not need a \u2018scandal\u2019 to crop up,\" the Patriot Beat story said above its repost of the Breitbart News story. \"However, that\u2019s precisely what\u2019s happened \u2014 and it\u2019s a doozy \u2026 According to a new report, McCaskill has funneled her husband $131 million in federal subsidies.\"\nWhile the Breitbart story relies on the Kansas City Star report, the Kansas City Star\u2019s research does not support the implications embedded in the inflammatory Patriot Beat headline. Its loaded words, such as \"busted\" and \"funneling,\" paint what could very well be a total coincidence as a deliberate attempt by McCaskill to profit off of taxpayer money.\nOther headlines \u2014 such as the Kansas City Star\u2019s \"Businesses linked to McCaskill\u2019s husband get $131 million in federal dollars\" \u2014 were more precise.\nHere\u2019s what actually happened.\nA July 24 analysis from the Kansas City Star revealed that businesses linked to Shepard have received approximately $131 million in federal subsidies since McCaskill took office in 2007.\nSpecifically, government-subsidized housing projects in which Shepard has invested were awarded $62 million and $69 million during McCaskill\u2019s first and second terms, respectively.\nThe businesses Shepard has invested in participate in affordable housing programs through both the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nThe USDA program subsidizes low-cost rental housing in rural areas for domestic farm laborers and low-income, disabled or elderly people. The federal subsidies compensate property owners on behalf of tenants who otherwise would not be capable of affording their full rent. Meanwhile, the HUD program contractually obligates private landlords and developers to reserve some housing units for cheap rental, and the subsidies again help to pay off part of the rent.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough Shepard gets only a fraction of each federal award as income \u2014 most of each subsidy contributes to covering operating costs for the projects \u2014 the Kansas City Star report noted that his personal income grew during McCaskill\u2019s two terms in the Senate, from between $1,608 and $16,731 in 2006 to between $365,374 and $1,118,158 in 2017.\nAccording to the Kansas City Star\u2019s analysis, \"a growing percentage of Shepard\u2019s personal earnings come from new businesses he has invested in that are receiving federal awards, primarily rural rental assistance through the USDA.\"\nThe Kansas City Star also made clear, however, that there is \"no evidence that McCaskill played any part in directing federal funds to businesses affiliated with her husband.\"\nMcCaskill has voted for some omnibus spending bills that would have benefited affordable housing programs, but she has voted against others. She also does not sit on the Senate committees with jurisdiction over HUD and USDA, where she could have had more influence.\nAdditionally, the Kansas City Star report noted that Shepard is now just a limited partner with most of the federally subsidized housing projects in which he invests. This means that he does not control day-to-day operations or the distribution of profits.\nThe report also specified that Shepard\u2019s investments in affordable housing predated his 2002 marriage with McCaskill. A spokesman for Shepard\u2019s company, Sugar Creek, told the Kansas City Star that the company is involved with fewer government housing projects now than before Shepard married.\nSimilar articles detailing subsidies provided to Shepard\u2019s businesses also surfaced in 2012.\n\"Claire's work in the Senate has absolutely nothing to do with her husband's business investments,\" said Meira Bernstein, McCaskill campaign spokeswoman.\nPatriot Beat did not respond to a request for comment.\nOur ruling\nA misleading headline said, \"Shock report: Senator McCaskill busted funneling millions of tax dollars to her hubby.\"\nThe article cited research from a credible newspaper \u2014 the Kansas City Star \u2014 showing that since McCaskill took office, her husband has seen his income increase at least in part because of federal subsidies awarded to housing projects that he has invested in.\nHowever, we found no evidence that McCaskill personally or deliberately routed any money to her husband\u2019s businesses. The use of the words \"busted\" and \"funneling\" in the Patriot Beat headline is not supported by the Kansas City Star\u2019s research.\nWe rate this statement Mostly False.\n Share the Facts 2018-08-02 16:36:58 UTC   PolitiFact    3 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly False  \"SHOCK REPORT: Senator McCaskill BUSTED Funneling Millions of Tax Dollars to Her Hubby.\"    Internet Rumors Bloggers https://patriotbeat.com/2018/07/25/shock-report-senator-mccaskill-busted-funneling-millions-of-tax-dollars-to-her-hubby/   in a blog Wednesday, July 25, 2018 2018-07-25    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01784"}
