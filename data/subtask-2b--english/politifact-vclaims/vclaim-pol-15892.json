John McCain accused Sen. Barack Obama of pandering to his audience\u00a0by flip-flopping on his rooting interest in the World Series.\n\nOn\u00a0Oct. 21, 2008,\u00a0in Bensalem, Pa., solid Philadelphia Phillies territory, McCain told a small audience, \"Now, I\u2019m not dumb enough to get mixed up in a World Series between swing states. But I think I may have detected a little pattern with Sen. Obama. It\u2019s pretty simple really. When he\u2019s campaigning in Philadelphia, he roots for the Phillies, and when he\u2019s campaigning in Tampa Bay, he \u2018shows love\u2019 to the Rays.\"\n\nThere\u2019s nothing so ugly as a flip-flopper on sports team loyalties. So we better get to the bottom of this.\n\nHere\u2019s the facts:\n\nObama in Dunedin, Fla., on Sept. 24, prior to the postseason: \"Congrats for the Rays. But I\u2019m a White Sox fan, and we\u2019ll see you in the playoffs.\"\n\nObama in Philadelphia, on Oct. 11,\u00a0after\u00a0the upstart Rays took out his White Sox in the first round of the American League playoffs: \"I am a White Sox fan. But since the White Sox are out of it, I\u2019ll root for the Phillies now.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObama in Tampa, Fla., on Oct. 20. Fresh off their ALCS\u00a0win over the Boston Red Sox, a small group of the Rays\u00a0attend Obama's rally and rookie pitcher David Price introduced the nominee. Said Obama: \"I\u2019ve said from the beginning that I am a unity candidate, bringing people together. So when you see a White Sox fan showing love to the Rays\u00a0\u2014 and the Rays showing some love back\u00a0\u2014 you know we are on to something right here.\"\n\nObama also joked that he had considered getting a mohawk as a show of solidarity with the Rays (that\u2019s what hard-core Rays fans do these days). \"But my political advisers said they weren\u2019t sure how that would play with swing voters,\" Obama said.\n\nIn the days before the Internet, it may have been possible to get away with pandering to sports enthusiasts in competing towns. No longer. Bloggers quickly pounced when Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin told a New Hampshire audience that\u00a0\"Red Sox fans know how to turn an underdog into a victor.\" The previous week, Palin sought to connect with a Tampa Bay crowd using nearly the same line. \"How about those Tampa Bay Rays?\" Palin said. \"You know what that tells me? It tells me that the people in this area know a little something about turning an underdog into a victor.\" Insert groan here.\n\nBut Obama\u2019s the one on the hot seat here. At no time has Obama wavered in his primary allegiance to the White Sox. Any movement on that front would be inexcusable. But his team is gone, and now whom is he pulling for?\n\nA statement released by Obama campaign spokesman Tommy Vietor, quoted\u00a0on a  New York Times  politics blog, sought to make things clear.\u00a0\"Senator Obama said he\u2019s rooting for the Phillies. Yesterday he said nice things about the members of the team who came out to support him, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that Tampa Bay bounced his White Sox out of the playoffs.\"\n\nIn the complex hierarchy of determining fan loyalty, we are left to weigh whether \"showing love\" for the Rays equates to \"rooting for\" the Phillies. No, these aren't equivalent. But if you're rooting for the Phillies, you sure don't show love for the Rays at a Tampa rally.\n\nIs it shameless pandering? Of course. But is it a flip-flop? Not quite.\u00a0We call it Half\u00a0Flip.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-15892"}
