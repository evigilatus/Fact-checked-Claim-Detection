Getting gorgeous. Turning it up,\" the show description says. \"Alyssa Edwards rules the dance studio by day \u2014 and the drag world by night.\"\nThe series is produced by RuPaul, and it\u2019s not exactly \"new.\" It debuted in October 2018 \u2014 about five\u00a0months after Barack Obama announced his Netflix production deal. And while the reality show stars a drag queen, the children in it \u2014 both boys and girls \u2014 are students at the Beyond Belief Dance Company. The photo in the Facebook post is a promo for the show, but, if you watch the show, you know that most of the children in the shot are girls, not boys in drag.\nJustin Dwayne Lee Johnson is the owner of the dance company and a popular contestant on RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race where his alter-ego, Alyssa Edwards, first became famous. Before that, the parents of his students didn\u2019t know their children\u2019s teacher was a gay man who does drag.\nThe Dancing Queen reality show followed and, as Vanity Fair recalled in this October 2018 article, the first two episodes show Johnson officiating a wedding of friends in full Alyssa Edwards drag, him buying his first home, and him visiting his childhood home in Mesquite, Texas. The series also has plenty of drama, sniping among the dance moms (think pageant moms) and dancing as the children practice and perform in competitions.\nWe rate this Facebook post Pants on Fire!\nCorrection:\u00a0This story was updated to reflect that Barack Obama announced his Netflix production deal about five months before Dancing Queen debuted. This story previously said that the show debuted seven months before the deal was announced.\n\u00a0\n Share the Facts 2019-05-17 17:21:02 UTC   PolitiFact    1 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Pants on Fire  There\u2019s a \"new Netflix show to make little boys into \u2018sexy\u2019 little girls.\"    Viral image On the internet     Tuesday, May 14, 2019 2019-05-14    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00624"}
