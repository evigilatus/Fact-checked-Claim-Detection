The $1 trillion-a-year program helps more than 63 million retirees, the disabled and their families.\u00a0\nBut it\u2019s wrong on both counts.\nFactCheck.org checked the same claim in June, saying it was made in a viral post on Facebook, and found it false. Our friends pointed out that:\n1. Annual cost-of-living adjustments for beneficiaries of Social Security and Supplemental Security Income benefits are determined not by Congress but by the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, which is calculated by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.\u00a0\nWe found that the cost-of-living increase for 2020, which was announced nearly two months before the post we\u2019re checking, is 1.6%.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJake Tapper\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in remarks in a CNN broadcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second presidential impeachment of Donald Trump was \u201cthe most bipartisan impeachment in American history.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a worker retiring at full retirement age, the maximum Social Security benefit in 2020 is $3,011 per month, up $150 from 2019.\n2. At the time of the FactCheck.org check, Congress had not decided whether to allow an automatic increase in pay for its members of 2.6% for 2020. That would have meant an additional $4,500 annually \u2014 not \"$8,872 monthly.\"\u00a0\nA deal for the $4,500 pay raise fell apart after a group of freshmen Democrats facing tough re-election campaigns asked their leader not to move forward, the New York Times reported.\nThat means the annual salary for members of the House and Senate remains at $174,000. (Leaders earn more.)\nAs we\u2019ve reported, under federal law, congressional pay raises are fixed to the Employment Cost Index, which measures changes in wages. The raises are automatic each year unless Congress votes it down \u2014 which it has done every year since 2009.\nOur ruling\nA Facebook posts says \"Congress rejects $336 (per) month increase in\" Social Security and disability benefits \"but approves $8,872 (per) month increase for themselves.\"\nCost-of-living adjustments for Social Security are determined by a federal agency using a consumer price index measure, not by Congress. And Congress hasn\u2019t allowed itself a pay raise since 2009.\nWe rate the statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17512"}
