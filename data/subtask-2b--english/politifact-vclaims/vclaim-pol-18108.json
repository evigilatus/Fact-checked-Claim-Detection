But he never slashed the programs Behar was referring to, however.\nAs the Washington Post noted, there were concerns among global-health leaders that U.S. funding for an initiative known as the Global Health Security Agenda was running out, and that some U.S.-run pandemic-prevention programs would have to be downsized as a result.\u00a0\nBut the Trump administration never pulled the plug on those programs, although it did propose smaller budgets. Congress has injected more money into them in recent budget requests.\nOne day after we reached out to ABC for comment, Behar made a tongue-in-cheek correction on air.\n\"The other day, I mistakenly said that Trump shut down anti-pandemic programs that Obama had set up in nearly 40 countries,\" Behar said. \"I\u2019m happy to say, he only attempted to cut funding for them, but that did not ultimately go into effect. Isn\u2019t that good?\"\nWhy the CDC thought its programs had to shrink\nThe CDC has been operating public-health programs in a number of foreign countries as part the Global Health Security Agenda, which the United States helped launch in 2014.\nThe initiative \u2014 which now includes 67 countries \u2014 is a global effort to help countries reduce the risk of infectious diseases.\u00a0\nThe bulk of its early funding came from a one-time, five-year emergency spending bill that Congress approved in late 2014 to respond to the Ebola epidemic in West Africa. The package appropriated almost $600 million for the CDC \"to support national public health institutes and global health security.\"\nThe CDC had hoped those funds would be replenished once the five-year supplement expired in October 2019, according to reports. But as the expiration date approached, it looked like the agency could be left with just the core annual budget to pull from.\nNational news outlets reported in the spring of 2018 that the CDC was bracing for a possible funding drop-off. The CDC planned to scale back operations in 39 of 49 countries and focus on 10 \"priority countries,\" according to emails reviewed by the Wall Street Journal.\nIn the end, however, Congress provided enough funding to sustain the programs, experts told us. (The White House and CDC did not respond to our requests for comment. The CDC told Factcheck.org it \"did not have to cut back its work\" to 10 countries.)\n\"The president's budget proposed slashing funding for CDC's (global health security) initiatives,\" added Claire Standley, an assistant research professor at Georgetown University\u2019s Center for Global Health Science and Security. \"In the end, that didn't happen.\"\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyan Fournier\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Noah Y. Kim \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe worry in early 2018 was that the budget for the CDC\u2019s global disease-prevention programs would be just over $50 million, as it had been in past years, when the supplement from 2014 was still the primary funding source. Trump\u2019s 2018 budget proposal put it in that ballpark.\nBut the budget Congress ultimately passed bumped the appropriations for \"global disease detection and other programs\" up to $108.2 million. The same amount was provided in 2019.\nIn November 2018, the Department of Health and Human Services pledged an additional $150 million \"to support capacity strengthening in high-risk countries around the world\" at a meeting in which the U.S. affirmed its commitment to the next phase of the Global Health Security Agenda.\nThe Trump administration\u2019s 2021 budget request appropriated $225 million for the same global-health programs, up from $183.2 million in 2020.\nAs we\u2019ve reported, Trump has consistently proposed cuts to certain CDC budgets, but the bills Congress ultimately passed \u2014 with Trump\u2019s signature \u2014 have steadily increased funding for the CDC\u2019s infectious-disease activities.\nExperts said the administration\u2019s wavering support has likely made it difficult for the CDC to plan out its activities.\n\"I don't think the 37 out of 47 statement is accurate,\" Standley said. \"But I do think that the Trump administration, in failing to provide consistent funding and clear indication of the priority placed on global health security capacity building, has made it difficult for the CDC to sustain the programs and successful efforts put into place since 2014.\"\n\"Programs weren\u2019t shut down in the end, but you can also say that the administration didn\u2019t prioritize them in the proposed budget,\" added Jennifer Nuzzi, an associate professor of public health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\nA problem with the numbers\nIt\u2019s not clear why Behar referred to a shutdown of 37 of 47 programs when the 2018 news reports said the CDC was considering scaling back 39 of 49 operations.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s possible she pulled from a tweet by Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., whose claim that Trump \"shut down 37 of 47 global anti-pandemic programs\" was debunked by other fact-checkers. But however you crunch the numbers, it\u2019s hard to get to 47 countries \u2014 or 49, for that matter.\nTrump has put no one in charge of Coronavirus.He is pushing cuts to the budgets of all the agencies that fight pandemics. He shut down 37 of 47 global anti-pandemic programs. Trump made a choice to make us vulnerable...to this pandemic and the next one and the next one.\u2014 Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) February 25, 2020 \nA 2019 annual report on the Global Health Security Agenda says the CDC provides financial support and technical assistance to 17 priority countries, plus technical assistance for 14 countries and CARICOM, a group of 15 Caribbean countries and dependencies.\nOne CARICOM country is Haiti, which is already listed among the countries receiving technical assistance from the CDC. Another is Montserrat, a British territory.\u00a0\nThat adds up to 44 total countries, or 50 if you include six other countries that Standley said received some early support specifically related to the Ebola outbreak.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nBehar said Obama \"set up anti-pandemic programs in 47 vulnerable countries as a way to protect against something like the coronavirus\" and \"Trump closed 37 of them.\"\nNews reports in 2018 said the CDC was planning to shrink its operations to help foreign countries prevent infectious diseases because it didn\u2019t expect to receive new funding once the supplement it received in 2014 ran out. But the programs didn\u2019t shut down in the end.\nThe spending bill that lawmakers ultimately passed that year provided more money for those CDC programs than Trump\u2019s budget request originally asked for.\nBehar corrected her statement.
