Ron Desantes is on the way to Hurricane Dorian.", "text": "President Donald Trump has been tweeting a lot about Hurricane Dorian. But one of the well-known Facebook bulletins invents a tweet from the president that he never wrote. The article, published in September, claims to be showing a footage of a tweet from Trump. The road of Dorian north off the Florida coast is reinforced by Trump on board the Republican government in the state.

In addition, @realdonalbtromp in her Twitter r\u00e9sum\u00e9 says it's a sarcastic account. \"La real Donald Trump, just Brady,\" read the r\u00e9sum\u00e9. \"If you think he really had him for a second, what does that say about him?\" However, hundreds of Facebook users share screen footage as if it were true. Just to make sure of that, we went over Trump's real Twitter page to see if he was tweeting about Gilom in contact with Dorian. He didn't. The Facebook article is not accurate and claims to be ridiculous. We value it pants on fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00184"}
