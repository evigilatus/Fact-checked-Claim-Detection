Tony Evers, among others.\nWe learned in late April 2019 that the Taiwanese tech giant\u00a0wanted changes to its $3 billion contract with the state to better reflect the evolving project.\nThe original agreement with the state called for Foxconn Technology Group to build a $10 billion manufacturing and research complex and employ up to 13,000 people across Wisconsin. In return they could get up to $4 billion in state and local government incentives.\nAfter meeting with Trump on May 1, 2019, Gou told reporters that Foxconn\u2019s plans in Wisconsin remain unchanged.\n\"It is not right to say our investment in Wisconsin has changed,\" Gou told Taiwan media, according to a report in the\u00a0Nikkei Asian Review. \"We suspended the work around October, November last year because the weather there was snowy and icy cold. We will continue our work in May when the weather gets warmer.\"\nIn some ways, that echoed a statement Foxconn provided to the Wall Street Journal on April 29, 2019, in which the company reiterated its job commitments and referenced the preceding winter.\n\"After the winter break, which has an impact on construction projects of this scale, we are now looking forward to beginning the next phases of construction on the Gen6 advanced manufacturing facility by Summer 2019 with production expected to commence during the fourth quarter of 2020,\" the company said.\nConstruction crews aren\u2019t exactly shocked to experience cold weather in Wisconsin during those months. So was the weather really bad enough, as Gou claimed, to cause a two-month shutdown?\nWe checked it out.\nThe weather\nGou\u2019s claim about snow and cold weather doesn\u2019t really fit with weather data maintained by the National Weather Service.\nThe Foxconn complex is in the Racine County village of Mount Pleasant.\nRecords for Racine show it did not snow in October. The average daily temperature was 41.1 degrees for the month, slightly below the norm of 44 degrees. But not exactly \"icy.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n \n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn November, it did snow on six days. The snow depth never exceeded 2 inches, but, the total November snowfall of 6.7 inches was well above the historic norm of 1.6 inches.\nThe temperature in November averaged 27.5 degrees, compared to a norm of 33.1 degrees.\n\"We were actually kind of fortunate throughout October, November, December and even January,\" said Dan Bukiewicz, president of the Milwaukee Building and Construction Trades Council. \"It was pretty favorable to get some things done.\"\nThe work\nThe suspended work Gou is referencing isn\u2019t really clear, and Foxconn officials didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for detail on what was shut down and when.\nBut work was clearly happening both months.\nThe company gave reporters a\u00a0tour of the work site on Oct. 4, 2018, and the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel described the scene as \"hundreds of workers on site, a dump truck coming or going every 12 seconds in the middle of the day and a 2- to 3-foot-thick base of aggregate being laid to support a complex of buildings more than a third of a mile long.\"\nThe Journal Sentinel was at the work site Oct. 22, 2018 and shot video of work going on beneath sunny skies.\n\nThe \"Wisconn Valley News\" update published by the state on Oct. 26, 2018 said the site was averaging 128 workers and 100 dump trucks a day as crews prepared two large building pads and finalized the first building on the site.\nAnother \"Wisconn Valley News\" update on Nov. 23, 2018 said about 100 trucks per day were bringing aggregate to the Foxconn site.\nOur ruling\nIn defending Foxconn\u2019s plans after a White House meeting, Gou claimed the company had suspended work in October and November 2018 because of the \"snowy and icy cold.\"\nFoxconn hasn\u2019t provided detail on what Gou is referring to, but there was clearly work going on at the site throughout that timeframe.\nAnd the weather data from those months isn\u2019t consistent with an extreme snowstorm or cold snap that would have caused a multi-month shutdown of a large-scale construction project.\nWe rate Gou\u2019s claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00678"}
