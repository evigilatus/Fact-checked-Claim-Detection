Megan Mitchell, Cornen &apos; s spokesperson, seeking elections for a third term, told us by e-mail that the Senator relied on a non-dated \"fact sheet\" from the Texas project against sex trafficking, under the supervision of the relevant provincial American women, and the 16 September 2009 report by Texas Children at Risk, a non-profit report focusing on \"the root causes of bad public policies affecting children.\" According to the newspaper \"25% of all victims of human trafficking in Texas,\" this is attributed without details to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The Children at Risk Report only details: \"In the last quarter of 2007, 30 per cent of calls received by the National Human Trafficking Hotline originated in Texas, and 25 per cent of all international victims certified by the United States Department of Health and Human Services were in Texas. As of the date of publication, the National Human Trafficking Hotline receives more calls from Texas than any other state.\" According to the report, Texas is \"Hop International Trafficking in Human Beings due to numerous crowded interstate highways, international airports, bus stations, shipping trade across the Gulf of Mexico, and its common border with Mexico... Texas is also a hot spot for local human trafficking because cities like Dallas, Houston, and Austin have many runaway and homeless youth.\" By e-mail, Dawn Lu, a staff lawyer for children at risk, told us that the last quarter of 2007 had been applied only to direct telephone calls, and that the 25 per cent reference figure reflected the percentage of all international \"certified\" victims of trafficking by the Human Security Service who were in Texas from April 2004 to January 2006. We also refer to a web page of the Federal Office for Refugee Resettlement, dated 2 October 2012, which states that under the Protection of Victims of Trafficking Act 2000, adult victims of trafficking in the country from elsewhere can become eligible for federal and State services for refugees. In order to be rehabilitated, the Ministry of Public Health must \"believe\" individuals as victims of trafficking in persons, according to the web page, which means that they must be victims of a serious form of trafficking; be willing to assist in every reasonable way in investigating and prosecuting serious forms of trafficking or be unable to cooperate due to physical or psychological trauma; and have removed obstacles related to immigration documents. Child victims do not need such testimony, as the page says. Subsequently, Leo referred to a federal report issued in July 2012 stating that in 2002, letters of certification had been sent to the benefit issuing offices in 14 states for 99 individuals. The report stated: \"The largest concentrations of victims were in Texas (31.3 per cent), Florida (19.2 per cent) and California (14.1 per cent). Another official contacted children at risk and said that Kornin &apos; s statement could have been formulated differently. Subsequently, the official, Mandy Kimble, said by e-mail that the 25 per cent mentioned by Cornen was in the context of his legislation targeting trafficking within the United States. \"We have no idea how many people are being trafficked in Texas or any state for that,\" wrote Kimball. \"We know that 25% of the \"foreign victims\" present and documented in the country from April 2004 to January 2006 were in Texas. Cornen didn't say that 25% of the victims were being trafficked in Texas. He said they were in Texas. This is the 25 percent that people are going through, because it's the concrete data and the only number that we have to go through, and these data are from HHS. Do these equipments collect? Marco Rubio stated on 27 January 2021 in his remarks \"Only in the Third World do you see this usual use to prosecute former leaders.\" \"That's because it's hard and almost impossible to determine the true number of victims,\" said Lou. \"Why? Because victims often do not define themselves as victims, some are misdefined and charged as criminals for related crimes (drugs, criminal assault, etc.). ) and others, because of the clandestine nature of human trafficking, hide in plain sight and may never face law enforcement or social service providers,\" Lew's books. \"In addition, although until recently trafficking in human beings has always existed, not all states even had a government law on trafficking in human beings, which contributes to the lack of information at the state level on the number of victims identified, traffickers convicted, etc.\" \"Certifying figures are some of the only concrete data we have regarding the number of victims of human trafficking in each state, and it is clear that many victims are certified from Texas. Once again, it is borne in mind that ratification covers only a percentage of international victims, and does not include local victims at all. So the problem in Texas, as in most states, is bigger.\" At Lou &apos; s suggestion, we arrived at Maria Trujillo, Executive Director of the Houston Rescue and Reform Alliance, whose mission is to educate the public, train professionals and empower the community to work to identify, rescue and restore freedom to victims of trafficking. By phone, Trujillo said that statistics from Cornen might have stopped in 2006 -- though only for adult victims from outside the United States, She also said that the Government had not since issued figures that would update the estimates. After 2006, Trujillo said that the Government had ceased to estimate the number of adult victims accredited at the state level, although national figures were still available. Kenneth Wolfe, spokesperson for the Department of Children and Families, an agency of the Ministry of Health and Human Safety, told us by e-mail that it was unable to calculate the number of victims of human trafficking in the United States or within any state. Wolfe said that the Agency had not recently reported on States that had obtained the most substantiated messages of international victims \"because information might be misinterpreted as a trafficking site, which often did not happen.\" These communications had been submitted at the national level in the fiscal year up to September 2011, to victims or their representatives in 38 states. Accredited victims came from 55 countries. Texas versus the world we were curious to see how Texas's trafficking range is piling up with other places in the world, some of which are famous for human trafficking. In the end, Cornen said that 25 per cent of victims of trafficking were in Texas only one phrase after he said that \"people around the world continue to be victims of slavery and human trafficking.\" At the global level, Trujillo said that the only recent estimate of victims of trafficking recommended by her came from the International Labour Federation, a United Nations agency, which estimated that 21 million victims had been killed in 2012. \"I'm comfortable with this number, I'm comfortable with their research,\" said Trujillo. \"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. This remains an estimate. No one can know the real number because it's a secret crime. A United Nations report issued in December 2012 describes the organization &apos; s estimate of 20.9 million people engaged in forced labour, including for sexual exploitation. While it is not known how many of these victims have been trafficked, the estimate implies that there are currently millions of victims of trafficking in persons in the world. The report also indicates that US Department of State figures indicate that there were 449 adults and 92 children from foreign countries certified as victims of trafficking in the United States in the fiscal year up to September 2010. The executive summary of the United Nations agency describes the survey-based methodology for estimating it and also states that Asia accounts for 56 per cent of the estimated global total, with Africa accounting for 18 per cent of the victims. \"Developing economies,\" including the United States, says the summary, representing 1.5 million, or 7 per cent, of the victims. Mitchell from the Kornin office learned of the lack of up-to-date estimates and the fact that the original estimate was limited to accredited victims from outside the country, and said by e-mail that his statement relied on \"the most recent data on Texas available.\" Governor Cornen said that 25% of the victims of trafficking are in Texas. This claim appears to depend on an outdated percentage for a sub-group of victims of human trafficking on the planet, i.e. adult \"documented\" victims from outside the United States who about five years ago were described as being in Texas from April 2004 to January 2006 - this calculation did not explain the victims of United States citizens. There was no estimate of the share of victims of human trafficking in the world in Texas, although United Nations estimates for 2012 appear to show that Texas is not home to a large share; victims are more prevalent in Asia and Africa than in the developed world, as the report said. All that has been said is that this allegation is shaking as incorrect and absurd. Pants on fire! Pants on fire - The statement is inaccurate and makes a ridiculous allegation.
