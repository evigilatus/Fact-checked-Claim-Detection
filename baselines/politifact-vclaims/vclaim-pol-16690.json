Dave Syverson of Rockford told WCIA\u2019s Mark Maxwell in a sit-down at the capitol, which aired Dec. 8. \"The amount of taxes would be the same, but Chicago wanted to keep more of it.\"\n\"As quick example,\" Syverson continued, \"in all the other casinos in the state, the local community keeps 5% of the revenue and then the state gets an average of about 35%. Under this scenario, Chicago \u2014 instead of 5% \u2014 Chicago would be keeping about 22% or 23% of the revenue and the state would get half the amount of what every other casino in the state was paying.\"\nThere\u2019s a lot of moving pieces in Syverson\u2019s claim, but the text of the bill he was referencing makes clear Chicago would have to cut its share as well \u2014 a point the senator conceded when we spoke with him.\nWhat the bill says\nThe plan Syverson referenced was introduced on the final day of veto session as an amendment to the gambling law that passed in the spring. It didn\u2019t gain enough traction for a floor vote this fall, but lawmakers could take it up again when they return to Springfield next month. Lightfoot continues to push hard for a change to the original gambling bill, pointing to a state-mandated consultant\u2019s report from August that called the tax structure on a Chicago casino \"onerous.\"\nThe consultant report warned that after accounting for operating expenses the effective tax rate on the Chicago casino would be 72%, leaving a profit margin of only 1% or 2%, or even exceeding casino revenue entirely.\nTo address this, Democratic state Rep. Bob Rita of Blue Island introduced a city-backed plan to lower both state and city tax rates for Chicago\u2019s casino, which is likely to become the state\u2019s highest grossing.\nThe gambling bill that passed the General Assembly in the spring and was later signed into law by Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker calls for a 33.3% tax on the casino\u2019s gross receipts dedicated to the city\u2019s pension obligations. Rita\u2019s legislation would have eliminated the city\u2019s flat tax and replaced it with rates ranging from 10.5% to 34.7%.\n\"It would be a cut to the city, because you\u2019re eliminating that 33% [flat rate],\" Rita told us in a phone interview.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNathan Deal\n\n\nstated on August 18, 2010 in a gubernatorial campaign forum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn bringing casino gambling and other gaming to Georgia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Willoughby Mariano \u2022 September 3, 2010\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the state\u2019s original graduated rates of 15% to 50% on the casino would have been lowered to a range of 12% to 40%, according to the bill.\nThe varying rates would be applied at different levels based on how much money the casino brings in under the plan. A similar series of graduated rates for both Chicago and the state would apply to revenue from table games.\nWhen we ran the bill\u2019s specifics by Syverson, he agreed the legislative language would cut rather than raise Chicago\u2019s take.\n\"If, in fact, we use the strict definition of the bill and Chicago was only going to get the tax rates that you gave me \u2026 then I would concede that Chicago would get a little bit less money,\" he said. \"Now, having said that, anyone with any common sense would say, why would Chicago introduce a bill that says, \u2018We want less money\u2019?\"\nRita\u2019s rejoinder: Without a lower tax structure that encourages companies to build and run a Chicago casino, there won\u2019t be a casino for the city or the state to tax.\nStill, Syverson remains concerned about the plan. He said his job as a state senator is to ensure Illinois doesn\u2019t lose out on needed funding from a Chicago casino and noted Lightfoot and the Chicago City Council have other tools to further tax the casino without getting an OK from the legislature.\nOur ruling\nSpeaking about a proposal to change the tax structure for a future Chicago casino, Syverson said the plan would lower taxes paid by the casino to the state and increase the taxes it pays to the city so that the overall amount would be the same but Chicago would \"keep more of it.\"\nThat doesn\u2019t entirely square with the language of the bill. As he said, it would have reduced tax revenue for the state \u2014 but it also would have lowered taxes paid to the city.\nSyverson conceded that last point in response to our inquiry.\nWe rate his claim Half True.\n\nHALF TRUE \u2013 The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16690"}
