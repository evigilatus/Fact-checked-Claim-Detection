There is a Facebook story as \"Hurry News\" claiming that US House President Nancy Belusi spent $497 million on the renovation of the office during the closure. The article was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The article was published on January 27, from a conservative website called Top Tobek. We found the same story that was published a day ago by We Arethe Lloyd.com. This is not a real news story. We \"Llod.com\" is a ironic blog known as the writing of artificial stories. The line of the site card is: \"Information you may not have to trust.\" We didn't find any evidence that Belusi spent nearly $500 million on office renovations within the 35 days that the government shut down. No stories have been reported in this regard. When we considered the expenditure reports of the United States House, we found the most recent report that passed only on 30 September 2018 - months before Belusi became speaker in January 3. Facebook wrote on January 11, 2021 in Facebook, Nancy Belusi, who was no longer the Speaker of the House of Representatives by Samantha Buterman. On January 12, 2021, the spokesman for Belusi Drew Hamel said: \"There were no innovations,\" and he said: \"There were no innovations.\" It seems that people still share rumors as a fact - every copy of the story is already crowded with more than 1900 shares on Facebook as of January. The story is even trying to break things that Belusi was supposed to buy for the office. We contacted the original writer to see if the numbers were based on any evidence. \"I've built my numbers on nothing,\" she told us. In the article, it refers to an \"investigation report\" from Boatway Bondet, a reserved site for news and opinion, which revealed that Pelosi \"paid contractors approximately $500 million to renovate her office.\" We have not been able to find any relevant report on the website of the Bondet portal. Our story says that Belusi spent nearly $500 million on office renovations during the closure. We have traced the original source of the article to a well-known sarcastic site by publishing false stories and there are no reliable sources to support this allegation. We value it pants on fire!
