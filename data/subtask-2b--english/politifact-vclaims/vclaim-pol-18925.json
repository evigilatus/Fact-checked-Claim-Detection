Martha McSally isn\u2019t really looking out for seniors.\nIn a Sept. 2 post on his campaign website, Kelly said McSally wouldn\u2019t protect Medicare, the government-run health insurance program for people over 65.\n\"And despite saying she would protect seniors, McSally supported a plan to turn Medicare into a voucher program and \u2018shift costs\u2019 onto seniors, according to the AARP,\" Kelly\u2019s website said, referring to the advocacy group for seniors. \"McSally even supported raising the retirement age.\"\nIs Kelly right about McSally\u2019s record on Medicare, vouchers and raising the retirement age?\n\u2018Supported a plan to turn Medicare into a voucher program\u2019\nKelly\u2019s campaign pointed to October 2017 reporting from the Arizona Daily Star that said McSally voted in favor of a Republican budget plan for fiscal year 2018 that \"would gradually change Medicare to a voucher program.\" (McSally served in the House at the time.)\nA Republican summary of that proposal said it would save and strengthen Medicare \"by moving to a premium support system,\" lowering costs for beneficiaries and the government through increased competition, and maintaining the option for traditional Medicare.\nUnder a premium-support or voucher system, beneficiaries would receive a payment to buy private insurance, or a traditional fee-for-service Medicare plan. A goal of switching over to the voucher approach is to slow the growth in Medicare spending. AARP in 2017 argued that such a switch could shift more costs to beneficiaries over time.\nExperts at the Kaiser Family Foundation said in a March 2017 blog post that proposals to convert Medicare to a voucher system could lead to higher Medicare premiums and cost-sharing for seniors already enrolled in the program. It may be the case that not all seniors would see costs go up, but some would, Tricia Neuman, senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told PolitiFact.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChain email\n\n\nstated on January 21, 2010 in a chain e-mail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMembers of Congress passed a pay raise for themselves of $10,000 over two years even as they voted not to raise Social Security benefits for 2010 and 2011.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 22, 2010\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough McSally endorsed a move to a premium-support or voucher system in 2017, she voted against her party in 2015, when she supported a motion that instructed House conferees to prevent Medicare from becoming a voucher program, among other things. McSally was one of only three Republicans who supported the motion offered by then-Rep. Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat from Maryland.\nMcSally embraced a more conservative voice during a 2018 Senate primary race. Before that she was generally perceived as a moderate Republican.\nMotions to instruct conferees and concurrent resolutions are not binding, so they do not directly stop or allow changes to Medicare or other matters. Budget resolutions lay out a plan.\n\u2018Supported raising the retirement age\u2019\nWhen she first ran for Congress in 2012, the Green Valley News asked McSally if Social Security was sustainable and whether she supported changes such as raising the retirement age.\nMcSally said Social Security was unsustainable and needed measures to strengthen it for future generations. \"For younger workers, we need to consider approaches such as gradually increasing the retirement age and allowing them to invest a portion of their Social Security payments in ways that will allow them to maximize their returns,\" McSally said.\nWe asked McSally\u2019s campaign about her position in 2020, but did not hear back.\nOur ruling\nKelly said McSally \"supported a plan to turn Medicare into a voucher program and \u2018shift costs\u2019 onto seniors\" and \"even supported raising the retirement age.\"\nMcSally has a mixed voting record regarding a transition of Medicare into a premium support or voucher program. Kaiser Family Foundation experts in 2017 said proposals to convert Medicare to a voucher system could lead to higher costs for seniors already enrolled in Medicare. McSally in 2012 stated support for potentially raising the retirement age. Her campaign did not say where she stood on that issue in 2020.\nKelly\u2019s claim is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.
