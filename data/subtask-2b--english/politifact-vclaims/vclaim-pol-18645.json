We reached out to Pence\u2019s press office, as well as the Trump campaign, for evidence or a comment, but we haven\u2019t heard back.\nSetting aside whether Harris could, as vice president, single-handedly dismantle police departments, is it true that she supports defunding the police?

We have to be honest about this.\"\nHarris has reiterated those talking points in several media appearances:\n\n\nOn June 8, she said: \"We don\u2019t want police officers to be dealing with the homeless issue. We don\u2019t want police officers to be dealing with substance abuse and mental health.
