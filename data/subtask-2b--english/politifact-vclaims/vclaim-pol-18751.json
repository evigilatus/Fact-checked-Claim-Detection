On Oct. 13, the Democratic presidential nominee said he is not a fan of the strategy. In a town hall two days later, he said he would give his position only after seeing how the confirmation process now under way for Judge Amy Coney Barrett is handled.\u00a0\nSocial media posts suggest, though, that Biden will not say what he stands for on any issue until after the election.\nOne Facebook post says, \"Biden said, \u2018The day after I\u2019m elected I will let you know what I stand for, bc if I tell you now it will be all over the news\u2019 ???? Did he really just say this??\"\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThat\u2019s because Biden did not say this. The purported quote is a\u00a0distortion of comments he made about whether he would support packing the court. Biden has outlined his positions on a wide range of other issues.\nThe basis of the Facebook claim appears to be a comment Biden made at a campaign stop in\u00a0Phoenix on Oct. 8.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen asked about the Supreme Court, Biden replied, \"You\u2019ll know my opinion on court packing when the election is over. Now look, I know, it\u2019s a great question, and I don\u2019t blame you for asking. But you know the moment I answer that question, the headline in every one of your papers will be about that ... other than focusing on what\u2019s happening now,\" a reference to the Barrett nomination proceedings. (The comment begins at the 47-second mark in this video.)\nBiden has since pivoted and said he will declare a position on expanding the Supreme Court prior to Election Day, based on the handling of the Barrett nomination. In a portion of a \"60 Minutes\" interview released Oct. 22, Biden proposed creating a bipartisan group of constitutional scholars who would study this and other court issues.\nPresident Donald Trump and Senate Republicans have sought to have Barrett confirmed and seated before the election, while Democrats wanted the president and Senate to wait until the winner of the Nov. 3 presidential election is known.\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post says Biden said, \"\u2018The day after I\u2019m elected I will let you know what I stand for, bc if I tell you now it will be all over the news.\"\nBiden did not say this, and the quote does not accurately reflect his position. It\u2019s a distortion of statements he has made about when he will state his view on whether to expand the Supreme Court.\nWe rate this claim Mostly False.\u00a0\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections FactChat #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click here, for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18751"}
