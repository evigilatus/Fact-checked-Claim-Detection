End a relationship. Destroy a career. Forward funny pet videos to your friends.\n\nAdd get alcohol when you\u2019re underage to the list of possibilities if a bill allowing wineries to ship directly to New Jersey consumers becomes law, said Assemblyman Joseph Cryan (D-Union).\n\nCryan wrote an op-ed criticizing legislation in the state Senate \u00a0that would allow direct shipment of wine. Cryan has sponsored a bill that would amend the state\u2019s licensing laws for wineries but does not allow direct shipping.\n\nAnd the debate over shipping wine is certain to raise at least one concern: underage drinking.\n\n\"Direct shipment provides a virtual store for teens to buy alcohol they would otherwise be prohibited from buying at liquor stores. It makes the face-to-face purchase transaction practically irrelevant; and makes underage drinking as simple as a mouse click,\" Cryan wrote in an op-ed posted on CourierPostOnline.com on Aug. 21.\n\nCan the under-21 crowd get drunk with the click of a mouse? PolitiFact New Jersey found it\u2019s not that easy.\n\nCryan\u2019s deputy chief of staff, Dave Jenkins, sent PolitiFact New Jersey a 2005 report from an arm of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to support the claim. The report said \"the Internet acts as a general store\" where teenagers can \"get hold of almost anything,\" including beer, wine and liquor, but also marijuana, prescription drugs and \"crack dealer locator services.\"\n\nThough the report raises concerns about what teenagers can access online, it does not address underage consumers ordering wine through a licensed winery.\n\nA 2003 study by the Federal Trade Commission and a 2010 report from the Comptroller of Maryland -- that noted the difficulty of proving a cause and effect relationship in this case -- found little to no evidence of an increase in underage drinking due to direct shipment of wine.\n\nThe Maryland report said, \"The reasons for this may be that: (1) \"wine\" is not the drink of choice for youth; and (2) direct shipment of wine is costly and time-consuming.\"\n\nJenkins called the Maryland report \"useless\" because its conclusion \"only recognizes the need for a better method of evaluation.\"\n\nOther studies show, and experts said, that underage consumers looking for alcohol probably aren\u2019t going to buy wine.\n\nAn April report in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine and a 2006 report by Columbia University\u2019s National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse both concluded that wine is not the first choice for underage drinkers.\n\nMarilyn Aguirre-Molina, professor of clinical population and family health at Columbia University\u2019s Mailman School of Public Health, said, \"teens are going online for everything imaginable, but something like alcohol -- which requires a credit card, an address to mail it too, as well as patience until it arrives -- online purchase of wine is a drag and hassle, especially if it\u2019s the least preferred of alcoholic beverages.\"\n\nEven if someone younger than 21 wanted to order a bottle of wine and successfully placed that order online, Cryan\u2019s claim starts to unravel when the product is packaged.\n\nFedEx and UPS require packages containing wine to be labeled, saying they contain alcoholic beverages. Also, both companies require the signature of an adult 21 or older upon delivery. The U.S. Postal Service does not ship wine.\n\nCryan\u2019s deputy chief of staff said it\u2019s lawmakers\u2019 responsibility to ensure underage individuals do not get access to alcohol.\n\n\"We cannot depend upon the policies of FedEx, or others to properly deny those underage from delivery. \u00a0We must be proactive, not reactive. \u00a0What if FedEx changes their policy tomorrow?\" he wrote in an email.\n\nJoanne Tetlow, a division staff attorney with the Comptroller of Maryland's field enforcement division who compiled the agency\u2019s report on direct wine shipment, said since \"we don\u2019t license consumers like we do retailers\" states that allow direct shipment of wine are relying on the shipping companies.\n\nAnd there is a chance those measures will fail.\n\n\"Do we believe it represents a threat? Absolutely,\" said Michael Scippa, public affairs director for Alcohol Justice, a California-based industry watchdog. He said age verification online and by delivery companies are \"two areas where it seems easy to or possible to bypass the law.\"\n\nThe ruling\n\nCryan claimed that allowing wineries to ship their product directly to consumers makes \"underage drinking as simple as a mouse click.\"\n\nBut even if an underage individual can order a bottle of wine online, the two major shipping companies in the U.S. require an adult signature in order to deliver the package.\n\nCryan\u2019s claim exaggerates a legitimate concern, but we can\u2019t ignore the hint of truth in the statement -- that shipping wine directly to homes provides another opportunity for underage access. \u00a0\n\nWe rate his statement Mostly False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNicholas Scutari\n\n\nstated on July 27, 2011 in in a NJToday interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Certainly we're going to be the most restrictive state in the land \u2026 in terms of who can get medical marijuana, how it will be prescribed and how it will be achieved in terms of moving it into the marketplace.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Erin O'Neill \u2022 August 14, 2011\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-12514"}
