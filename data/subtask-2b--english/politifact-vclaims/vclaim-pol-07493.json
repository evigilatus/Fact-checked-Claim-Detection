That\u2019s especially true now, as Oregon shakes off the lingering doldrums of the Great Recession.\nThe claim:\nRepublican gubernatorial challenger Rep. Dennis Richardson, in a recent debate with incumbent Democratic Gov. John Kitzhaber, said Oregon\u2019s economy has lagged behind the nation\u2019s for years.\n\"It\u2019s been 17 years that we\u2019ve had unemployment higher than the national average in Oregon,\" said Richardson, a state representative from Central Point. \"When is that going to change?\"\nOregon\u2019s unemployment rate hasn\u2019t dipped below the national rate since 1997? PolitiFact Oregon checked.\nThe analysis:\nWe emailed Nick Beleiciks, an economist with the state Employment Department.\nThe last time Oregon\u2019s monthly seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was lower than the U.S. rate, Beleiciks wrote, was February 1996, when Oregon was at 5.4 percent and the U.S. was at 5.5 percent. So it\u2019s actually been 18 years since Oregon\u2019s jobless rate was lower than the national average, he said.\nAs with anything involving the intersection of politics and economics, however, the matter doesn\u2019t stop there, Beleiciks added.\nIn mid-2007, leading into the Great Recession, he wrote, the state\u2019s jobless rate of 5.2 percent was just 0.2 percentage points higher than the U.S. average. As recently as February 2014, Oregon\u2019s rate was a mere 0.1 percentage point higher, at 6.8 percent.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Godlewski\n\n\nstated on January 9, 2021 in Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all women that lost jobs (in the December jobs report), it was mostly Black and Latina women. In fact, white women gained employment.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Nusaiba Mizan \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeleiciks\u2019 point: \"Statisticians don\u2019t consider Oregon\u2019s unemployment rate to be significantly different than the U.S. when our rate is just a few tenths of a percentage point higher or lower.\"\nThe most recent numbers, for June 2014, showed a 0.7 percentage point difference, with Oregon at 6.8 percent and the U.S. at 6.1 percent. \"Very close,\" Beleiciks said, \"to the historical average difference.\"\nRichardson, in the debate, didn\u2019t specifically blame Kitzhaber in making his claim, though Richardson\u2019s staff later confirmed that was the implication. Kitzhaber is in his third term as governor, serving from 1995 to 2003 and since 2011. He\u2019s now running for an unprecedented fourth term.\nWe found an Oregon Employment Department report from February 2009 showing that the state\u2019s unemployment rate had been higher than the national rate in 25 of the previous 33 years \u2013 meaning Oregon\u2019s higher jobless rate long predates Kitzhaber\u2019s first inauguration.\nWe also called B. Starr McMullen, an Oregon State University economics professor, to ask how much sway any one politician might have to reverse those lines.\n\"Not much,\" McMullen said. \"If we could figure out why we are consistently remaining above the national average and the problem was solvable by government policy, we would have done that a long time ago.\"\nTom Potiowsky, former state economist and now chairman of Portland State University\u2019s Economics Department, agreed. \"You\u2019ve got rural areas facing long-term unemployment because there are few jobs there and nowhere near the military contracts in Oregon that, say, Washington and California have,\" he said.\nThe ruling:\nRichardson, in a recent debate with Kitzhaber, claimed that Oregon\u2019s unemployment rate has hovered above the national rate for 17 years.\nIt\u2019s actually been 18 years, but that covers the time frame of Richardson\u2019s claim. Also, though a state economist said Oregon\u2019s rate was sometimes statistically even with the national average, that feels like splitting hairs. Anyone looking up Oregon Employment Department statistics would find Oregon\u2019s rate higher for the period Richardson cites.\nThough Richardson implied that Kitzhaber was at fault, he didn\u2019t say so directly at the debate, so we didn\u2019t evaluate that as part of Richardson\u2019s claim.\nWe find Richardson\u2019s claim True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07493"}
