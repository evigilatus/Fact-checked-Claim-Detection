During the same time last year, there were 42 murders \u2013 a 24 percent increase.\nSo while the increase is not as dramatic as suggested in the neighborhood forum or compared to similar cities, the rate is up.\nBut the rates fluctuate wildly per week, which is how the police department reports all crimes.\nSo it did appear that Atlanta had a serious surge of murders for the week ending May 23, or the 21st week of the year.\nThen, the homicide rate was up 54 percent at the time (40 murders at that point this year versus 26 last year).\nThen again, the city went without any murders for three weeks this year, between March 15 and April 2.\nAnd that spike in Week 21 was followed by no homicides in Week 22, the data show. In fact, the city had no murders at again for another multi-day run, between June 10 and June 20.\n\"These numbers are very fluid,\" said Atlanta Police Capt. Michael O\u2019Connor, who serves as the department Homicide Commander.\nSo while brass are concerned that the rate is up and in theory on pace to be above 100 annual murders for the first time in years, \"it\u2019s very difficult to trend to know where you are going to finish the year.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in remarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCriminologists support that analysis \u2013 and lack of analysis that can be done.\nTo some extent, after years of declining murder rates, an increase can be little more than a statistical blip to get closer to a median.\nBut without minimizing the loss of 52 lives, there isn\u2019t much statistical analysis that can be done with such a relatively low number, said Dennis Jay Kenney, a professor of criminology at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice.\nFor instance, only two women have been reported murder victims in Atlanta this year. While that may suggest the city has a better handle on domestic violence murders, a single such death could skew the data to suggest the exact opposite.\n\"You don\u2019t want to jump to a lot of conclusions,\" Kenney said. \"If homicides are up, you are not necessarily at greater risk because we don\u2019t randomly select our murder victims.\"\nThat is, there are some people more at risk to be victims than others.\nBroadly speaking, that tends to be young men, especially men of color.\nAtlanta Police have just begun sifting through its first-half data to compare victims, perpetrators and scenarios to see just where the greatest risks lie, O\u2019Connor said.\nPolice do that constantly, targeting for instance a specific neighborhood or specific gang that may be making trouble.\nPutting a larger number of victims and suspect pool up for comparison should help analysts see if anything stands out that will help insert police sooner into the equation \u2013 and hopefully prevent some deaths, O\u2019Connor said.\nIt also will provide Atlanta Police Chief George Turner with some information to share with his counterparts at the Major Cities Chiefs Association on Gun Violence Summit, being held in Washington, D.C. next month.\nSuch events are often heavy on anecdotes, Kenney said, but can provide the start of understanding crime trends.\n\"When you can see a general increase virtually everywhere, that suggests crime is up but doesn\u2019t tell you anything about why or what to do about it,\" he said. \"Still, the police have to anticipate what they can so they can refocus their energies, and they seem to be doing that.\"\nOur ruling\nA neighborhood association alerted Atlanta residents that the city\u2019s homicide rate is up for the year and has even reached a 50 percent increase.\nAt one point, the murder rate did spike that high, though with weekly fluctuations, the year-to-date rate is up about a quarter from this time last year.\nThat puts Atlanta in line with other cities seeing an increase in their murder rates.\nThere is little conclusion on what might be driving the rate, or even if different cities share the same causes.\nBut a 24 percent increase is cause for notice.
