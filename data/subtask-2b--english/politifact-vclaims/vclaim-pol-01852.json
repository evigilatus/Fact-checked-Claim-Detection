It might have been legal, the contribution itself, but the way the money was earned was illegal.\"\nDid Browder's associates\u00a0send $400 million to Hillary Clinton's campaign?\nNo. We found $17,700 donated to Clinton and another\u00a0$297,000 to the Democratic National Committee.\nA little background\nThe Russians say that Browder and his partners at Ziff Brothers Investments, a New York venture capital firm, illegally syphoned billions of\u00a0rubles out of the country. To add salt to the wound, Browder had led the charge to pass the 2012 Magnitsky Act, a law that penalizes Russian officials suspected of sanctioning the death of Browder\u2019s lawyer Sergei Magnitsky in a Russian prison.\nThe Ziff brothers came up during the June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower between Donald Trump Jr. and others, and Natalia V. Veselnitskaya, a Russian lawyer who promised dirt on the Hillary Clinton campaign. According to transcripts from Senate Judiciary Committee interviews, Veselnitskaya\u2019s materials described the Ziffs as Democratic donors, although Trump\u2019s son said they gave both to Democrats and Republicans.\nFollow the money\nWe reached out to the Russian Embassy and the Russian consulate in Washington to get details on the $400 million donation and had not heard back in time for our deadline.\nGiven that Veselnitskaya tied Browder and the Ziff brothers together, we researched their political donations.\nBrowder became a British citizen and can\u2019t legally contribute to U.S. candidates. Ziff Brothers Investments through its executives can give freely, and they have.\nBefore we get into their political contributions, we also wondered if Putin could have been talking about money that went to the Clinton Foundation.\u00a0In past years, Browder and Ziff Brothers Investments had given to the Clinton Global Initiative, a project of the Clinton Foundation, but the total was not more than $110,000, records show.\nIn the 2016 election cycle, Ziff Brothers Investments\u00a0gave $1.7 million. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, nearly two-thirds, or about $1.1 million, went to Democratic committees, and the rest to Republicans.\nThe center listed the firm\u2019s top recipients:\n\n\n\n\nRecipient\n\n\nAmount\n\n\n\n\nDNC Services Corp\n\n\n$296,966\n\n\n\n\nSenate Majority PAC\n\n\n$250,000\n\n\n\n\nDefending Main Street\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$200,000\n\n\n\n\nDemocratic Senatorial Campaign Cmte\n\n\n$40,000\n\n\n\n\nDemocratic State Central Cmte/Louisiana\n\n\n$35,412\n\n\n\n\nNational Republican Congressional Cmte\n\n\n$32,400\n\n\n\n\nDemocratic Party of Montana\n\n\n$28,622\n\n\n\n\nDemocratic Executive Cmte of Florida\n\n\n$27,287\n\n\n\n\nDemocratic Party of New Hampshire\n\n\n$27,287\n\n\n\n\nDemocratic Party of Virginia\n\n\n$27,287\n\n\n\n\nDemocratic Party of Wisconsin\n\n\n$27,287\n\n\n\n\nGeorgia Federal Elections Cmte\n\n\n$27,287\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nFederal law puts tighter limits on contributions to individual candidates. Here, the Ziffs mainly put their money into incumbents, and Republicans did better by a margin of about $145,000 to $46,000. Clinton\u2019s campaign received $17,700.\nUnless Putin had other Browder associates in mind, his figure of $400 million going to the Clinton campaign is a massive exaggeration. Between the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, the Ziffs gave about $315,000.\nThe Clinton campaign raised $563 million overall, so Putin's sum would account for nearly three-fourths of all donations.\u00a0(PACs affiliated with Clinton's campaign raised an additional $231 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.)\nOur ruling\nPutin said associates of Bill Browder gave $400 million to the Clinton campaign. The associates appear to be the Ziff brothers. According to public data, Ziff Brothers Investments gave about $315,000 to Clinton and the Democratic National Committee.\nOverall, the firm gave about $1.1 million to Democratic committees around the country.\nThe exaggeration is so great, we rate this claim Pants on Fire.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to PolitiFact's new daily email\n* indicates required\n\nEmail Address *\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Share the Facts 2018-07-16 21:35:00 UTC   PolitiFact    1 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Pants on Fire  Says associates of financier Bill Browder \"sent a huge amount of money, over $400 million, as a contribution to the campaign of Hillary Clinton.\"    Vladimir Putin President of the Russian Federation https://www.pscp.tv/w/1BRJjeoqEYBGw?t=1h51m30s   In a press conference with President Donald Trump in Helsinki.
