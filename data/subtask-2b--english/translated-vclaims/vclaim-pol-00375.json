A claim in the Thirtieth Declaration focused on a question posed by Savannah Guthrie from TODAY and one of the moderators on 27 June in Miami. The announcement begins with a Guthrie video asking: \"Rise your hand if your government plan will provide coverage for undocumented immigrants.\" All candidates on stage raised their hands. On the stage that night she was: writer Marianne Williamson; former Gove Colorado. John Hickenlooper, businessman Andrew Yang; South Pend, Ind. :: Mayor Pete Butigigig; former Vice-President Joe Biden; Sin Bernie Sanders of Vermont; Sin Kamala Harris of California; Sin Kristin Gillibrand of New York; Sin Michael Bennett of Colorado; and Rip Eric Swallwell of California. (Swallow has withdrawn since then.) He said Trump's announcement was in the form of candidates raising their hands. These Democrats are supporting the provision of free health care to illegal immigrants at our expense. Then the ad goes to another picture of a group of people - supposedly migrants on their way to the United States illegally - walking in a field. \"Expenditure of taxpayers' funds to cover illegal immigrants,\" said the ad. Is it true that, in a June debate, Democrats said that they supported free health care - at the expense of taxpayers - for illegal immigrants in the United States? The announcement is misleading. The candidates were asked whether their health-care plans would cover illegal immigrants here. However, they were not asked directly whether such coverage would be free. By looking at candidates' statements that night and at their individual platforms, we can better understand how exactly the idea that they support \"free\" coverage is not entirely correct. Some of the candidates on the stage that night supported medical care for all. The Sanders version is a single national health insurance programme covering everyone living in the United States. There will be no costs to individuals from their own funds - no deductions, no joint payments or insurance - but any person who works in a job or is self-employed will be paid to the system through taxation. In this sense, coverage will not be free for anyone who works. (Some immigrants in the country pay income taxes illegally). Candidates in favour of medical care for all share the goal of universal coverage, but some caution against replacing fully the current mix of private and public insurance. Some candidates prefer a plan that allows people to maintain their own insurance and buy a \"general option.\" The Sanders Medical Care for All Bill 2017 also stated that it is the Minister of Health and Human Services who will determine the conditions of residence for eligibility for coverage. At this stage, there is no rule for health-care coverage that sets the criteria for residency in the United States. The question and answer in the June discussion of Tom Cotton, classified on February 1, 2021, in the Fox interview and friends of \"Many of these arriving immigrants, we have no way of checking their background for either health or security.\" By Miriam Valverdi, 3 February 2021, health care was a major theme in the 27 June debate in Miami and, at some point, Guthrie turned the conversation into an illegal coverage of people here. The following is a copy of that exchange. Guthrie: \"Many of you have been talking tonight about the government health care plans I have proposed in one way or another. This is a question raised by hands. And stop them for a moment so people can see. Raise your hand if your government plan will cover undocumented migrants.\" All candidates on stage raised their hands. Guthrie then asked Buttig to support his positive answer. \"Our country is healthier when everyone is healthier. And remember, we're talking about something people get given a chance to buy. In the same way that there are undocumented immigrants in my country who pay, pay sales taxes, pay property taxes directly or indirectly. This isn't about charity. This is the insurance program. We offer no service to ourselves by having 11 million undocumented people in our country who are unable to access health care.\" Guthrie then asked Biden to comment. Biden: \"You can't allow - as the mayor said, you can't let patients, regardless of their source, whatever their condition, be exposed. You can't do that. She will only be taken care of, for a while. You have to. It's the human thing to do. \"But here's the deal. And the deal is he's right about three things. First, it actually contributes to the well-being of the country, but it also - for example, increased the age of social security because it - has a job. They pay the social security tax. That's what they do. I've increased the length of my life. They will do the same in terms of reducing the total cost of health care by providing them with access to treatment and not waiting until they are in a state of uncertainty.\" No other candidate commented on this issue. Therefore, all candidates had raised their hands and confirmed that they had a plan that would provide coverage for illegal immigrants in the country. However, the question was not asked directly whether the coverage would be free. But Stigge specifically said that people would buy cover and that it wasn't about charity. In his reply, Biden spoke of the contributions of illegal immigrants in the country - and said that if they had health-care coverage, they would reduce the cost of the comprehensive health-care system. Our ruling in Trump's re-election campaign was said by the Democratic Presidential candidates, \"Supporting free health care for illegal immigrants at our expense.\" This is misleading. The claim is based on some of the questions raised in a June discussion. The candidates were asked whether their health-care plans would provide coverage for illegal immigrants in the country. All the candidates raised their hands. However, the question was not raised as to whether coverage would be free. Two candidates able to provide the context - Butigig and Biden - did not say that it would be free of charge. Some candidates on the stage support comprehensive health care coverage, through medical care for all. However, there is no agreement among all candidates on the provisions of this type of coverage. A copy of the universal medical care system would provide coverage for all individuals by replacing premiums, co-payment and discount. One way in which the Government pays for medical care for all is through taxes on salaries; therefore, migrants in the country who pay income taxes illegally will contribute in this way. We assess the declaration statement as often false.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00375"}
