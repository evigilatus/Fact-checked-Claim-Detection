Barack Obama said that it was time to get away from \"special interest-dominated politics in Washington.\" He criticized Sen. John McCain for hiring some of the biggest lobbyists in Washington to run his presidential campaign.\n\n\n\"And when called on it,\" Obama said, \"his top lobbyist actually had the nerve to say, 'The American people won't care about this.' I think the American people do care about it.\"\n\n\nObama didn't say who he was talking about, and his campaign did not respond to clarify.\n\n\nBut we think Obama was referring to comments McCain campaign senior adviser Charlie Black made aboard McCain's campaign plane on May 19.\n\n\nSeveral days prior, the McCain campaign had issued a \"conflict policy,\" which prohibits anyone paid to work for the campaign from being a registered lobbyist. Unpaid volunteers can be lobbyists, but they must list their clients and can't serve on policy committees that deal with issues in which those clients may have an interest.\n\n\nThe policy came on the heels of the departure of several high-level campaign officials after embarrassing disclosures about their current or former lobbying activities.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.

McCain is committed to maintaining the integrity of the campaign \u2014 hence his commitment to the re-vetting process. But, Black added, 'I do not believe that average voters out there care.'\"\n\n\nSure sounds like Black was saying he doesn't think the American people care about this issue.
