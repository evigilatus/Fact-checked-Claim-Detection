One economy anywhere in the world and it's not even close,\" said the President, crowding thousands at the Resch Center. Trump later called the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement \"one of the worst trade transactions signed in our country's history\" and said if you \"see about Wisconsin you still see scars.\" He continued to trade, and the President said that his administration was \"very close to making a deal with China.\" \"We lost in China for many years, $500 billion a year,\" said Trump. \"We've rebuilt China. We've given them a lot.\" Is President Trump right that the United States loses $500 billion a year to China? Not exactly. As noted by Polite Fact, the trade balance of a country is simply the difference between the value of its imports and exports, and a trade deficit occurs when imports exceed exports. United States trade deficit in goods (i.e., In 2018, China rose to $419.2 billion, compared with the previous record of $375.5 billion in 2017, according to a report by the Ministry of Commerce. In 2016, China &apos; s merchandise deficit was $347 billion. The United States Census Bureau, which is part of the Department of Commerce, documents the United States trade deficit in goods with China dating back to 1985, when the deficit was $6 billion. Our colleagues at Politi Fact National verified the President &apos; s demand for a $500 billion trade deficit with China at least twice. Check the facts in 2018, one of the most recent things to deal specifically with trade with China, and assess this claim by Trump: \"Last year we lost $500 billion on trade with China.\" In 2017, the year in question, the value of Chinese goods imported into the United States ($505 billion) exceeded US merchandise exports to China ($130 billion) by some $375 billion. So at the time, Trump's figure was $500 billion down by $125 billion. Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" \u2022 On January 26, 2021, the official national Trump may have mixed China's trade deficit with the US general trade deficit, which reached $566 billion in 2017, or Trump could also use $500 billion as usual. In any event, the claim was assessed as mostly false. In his latest allegations, Trump became closer because the deficit had increased - to $419 billion in 2018. But he's still out of line. Although Trump did not mention the planned Foxcon plant in Wisconsin, some analysts believe there is a link between it and trade negotiations with China. Taiwan-based Foxcon promised to create 13,000 jobs in Racine County in its planned flat-screen manufacturing complex - although these numbers have long been in question. In January 2019, there were Foxcon reports that were reconsidering their investment. Lately, Jove. Tony Evers, officials of Foxcon, said that they wanted to rewrite a contract that would determine the amount of investment that Foxcon must make in Wisconsin in order to obtain taxpayers' subsidies. On April 30, 2019, the President of Foxcon and Executive Director Terry Goe visited the White House to discuss the extended manufacturing facility built by the Taiwanese technology giant in South-East Wisconsin. In February, when Foxcon recommitted to the process, Goo and Trump said that he and Trump spoke of the great dangers of the trade war between the United States and China. \"American President Trump shared with me yesterday on the telephone that progress in negotiations between China and the United States is going well, and they are likely to reach agreement soon,\" said Go, according to a report in the Asian magazine Nikki. At that time, some commercial analysts told the newspaper Milwaukee Sentinel that they believed that the promise of Foxcon to build an industrial complex in Wisconsin was a bargaining chip in the economic conflict between Washington and Beijing. \"If you believe that foreign investment is one of the moving pieces (in trade talks), it is definitely him,\" said Mary Flev, an economist specializing in international trade and investment at the Peterson Institute of International Economics in Washington, D.C., \"she's pawns on the chess board.\" We're classified in a green bay grouping, and Trump says, \"We've been losing in China for many years, $500 billion a year.\" While the United States has faced a trade deficit with China for many years, the President &apos; s use of the $500 billion figure is an overrun. There is no doubt that Trump &apos; s repeated use of this figure is getting closer - mainly because the trade gap is widening. But it's still closed. We assess the claim mostly wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00689"}
