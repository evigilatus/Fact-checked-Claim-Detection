Gov. Gavin Newsom is among the state\u2019s biggest gun control backers.\nHe led the campaign to place Proposition 63, known as the Safety For All Initiative, on the state\u2019s November ballot. It would require instant background checks for ammunition purchases; strengthen checks for gun purchases and ban the possession of large, detachable military-style magazines; and require the immediate surrender of firearms for people convicted of serious and violent crimes.\nThe Safety For All campaign made a recent statement about the prevalence of gun dealers in California. It\u2019s a colorful claim like Obama\u2019s, but has a bit more hard data to back it up.\n\"There are at least twice as many licensed firearm dealers in California as there are McDonald\u2019s,\" the campaign\u2019s spokesman said in recent email.\nPolitiFact Georgia rated a similar claim in 2013 as Mostly True. A civil rights activist said: \"There are twice as many gun shops as McDonald\u2019s in the United States.\" Our California claim deals with licenses in this state only, and not necessarily brick-and-mortar gun shops.\nWith our appetite piqued, we decided to dig into this fast-food-meets-firearms platter.\nGolden Arches\nNot surprisingly, there are many places in California to get a Big Mac -- more than a thousand, according to several sources. The American Enterprise Institute and the Foundation for Economic Education reported in April that, at that time, there were 1,165 McDonald\u2019s in California. A Cal State Northridge study cited the same figure.\nA McDonald\u2019s spokeswoman could not immediately confirm that figure. The company\u2019s website, however, puts its nationwide restaurant total at more than 14,000.\nAssuming 1,165 is correct for California, there would need to be at least 2,330 licensed gun dealers in the state to make the campaign\u2019s statement correct.\n\nPhoto by Mike Mozart / Flickr\nGun dealers\nTo be licensed in California, gun dealers must obtain both state and federal permits; be 21 or older; pay a $200 application fee; have a valid address; and undergo criminal and credit background checks.\nThey don\u2019t necessarily need a commercial storefront.\nPinpointing the number of licensed gun dealers in the state is not simple.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin Nunes\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in an interview on Fox\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRepublicans have no way to communicate\u201d after tech companies cut off Parler.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Amy Sherman \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Safety For All campaign referred us to data collected by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.\nThe ATF keeps a monthly log on its website of how many dealers and pawnbrokers are licensed to sell guns in each state.\nThis month\u2019s tally shows 2,315 dealers and pawnbrokers licensed to sell guns in California. That\u2019s a shade less, 15 in fact, than twice as many McDonald\u2019s.\nBut the Safety For All campaign spokesman asserted there are hundreds more people authorized to sell guns in California, under different federal license categories.\n\nOther categories\nThose extra federal categories include 521 licensed firearms manufacturers and 74 licensed firearms importers in California.\nRoger Root, who oversees firearm license investigations for the ATF in Northern California, said those nearly 600 licensed manufacturers and importers are, in fact, federally authorized to deal guns, even if they\u2019re not technically called \u2018dealers.\u2019\n\"We don\u2019t require that they get an additional (federal) license,\" Root said. \"You are also allowed, in essence, to deal firearms.\"\nThat would bump the number of people licensed to sell guns in California closer to 2,900, more than twice as many McDonald\u2019s.\nThere's one wrinkle. About 5 percent or less of federal license holders, in all firearms categories, never go on to obtain an equivalent state firearms license required by the California Department of Justice, Root said.\nBut taking 5 percent away from the 2,900, would still leave far more than twice as many McDonald\u2019s.\nOur rating\nLt. Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s Safety For All Initiative\u00a0campaign recently claimed: \"There are at least twice as many licensed firearm dealers in California as there are McDonald\u2019s.\"\nFirearms license data tracked by the ATF show there\u00a0are currently 2,315 authorized firearms dealers and pawnbrokers in the state. Two other categories authorized to deal firearms bring the total closer to 2,900, which is far more than double the 1,165 Golden Arches in California.\nA small fraction of the federal licensees never obtain their equivalent California permit. So, the total could be somewhat less than 2,900, but still enough to validate the statement.\nWe rated the claim True.\n\nTRUE\u00a0\u2013 The statement is accurate and there's nothing significant\u00a0missing.\u00a0\nClick here for\u00a0more\u00a0on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/021386a3-8596-462e-b6b4-00ac302b2bff", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04670"}
