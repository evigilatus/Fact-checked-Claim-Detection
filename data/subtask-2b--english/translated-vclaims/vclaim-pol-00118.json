The Tony Evers School Technology Programme", "text": "Party snipers on school spending in Wisconsin are still alive and in good health - despite the completion of the budget and final veto for months. (Democrat government) Tony Evers, former supervisor of public schools, made education funding for K-12 the focus of his ruling campaign and directed an additional $65 million towards schools with some of his 78 vetoes. However, a recent Republican weekly radio broadcast broadcast by state radio stations criticized Evers for the money he had withdrawn from a school program. The Republic of the State. R-Rhinelander, Rob Swaringen, aimed at Evers for the veto that broke the personal computer software, which was financing equipment such as chromboxes and diskettes. The programme distributed $7.9 million to 353 districts in the school year 2018-19, according to the General Education Department of Wisconsin. \"Until July, students in 352 counties across the state, in addition to three rented schools, took advantage of the program,\" Swiringen said on September 5, 2019, address. \"In objecting to this worthy program, Governor Evers took money off the table for children throughout the state, saying it would be better to spend in urban areas like Madison and Milwaukee.\" Apart from the fact that his account in the province is out of date, Sweeringen, a largely rural area, demonstrates that Evers has diverted money around the state to the largest provinces in the state. Let's see if he's right. That is what Jehovah teaches us: \"We learn from the Scriptures that we must keep the holy earth. The 65-page document briefly described the work of Evers on the hardware programme. Here's what Evers said: I object to providing funds to the provinces on the basis of each student using an organic account that does not match the students enrolled in the ninth grade. In addition, I believe that provinces may choose to invest in technology through the flexibility provided by the increase in the revenue ceiling and through the existing technological education programme. Furthermore, these funds can be spent more effectively on programmes that fill delivery gaps. Misick then linked this to the 2017 Wisconsin State Journal, which referred to Milwaukee and Madison with the greatest gaps in achievement between white and black students. He also cited other stories indicating gaps in achievement as an urban issue. Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" \u2022 January 26, 2012, we will point out that Evers' veto has several reasons in addition to those mentioned, including how funding has been allocated in this programme and how other programmes can respond to this need. The Ives signal was not specific to the ethnic gaps in achievement, as Swearengen assumes in linking this allegation to Milwaukee and Madsen. There are several other types of gaps in achievement, with some overlap. For example, the non-partisan Wisconsin Policy Forum released a report in March detailing the low degrees in mathematics and reading published in Wisconsin by English learners, students with limited proficiency in English. They found that the three provinces with the highest percentage of English learners (more than 30 per cent of total students) were Arkadia, Abbotsford and Independence - all small rural districts. The Department of Public Information programme, launched in 2015-16, aims to bridge the income-based delivery gap. Melissa Baldav, spokesperson for Evers, noted that Rasin, Kenosha and Green Bay were among the districts outside Milwaukee and Madison that faced gaps in achievement between black and white. She noted that Evers had not moved the money as demonstrated by Swearengen. In general, Evers said that funding to fill gaps in delivery was a more effective way to spend our dollars, and Baldov said. \"The money was not directed at other things.\" Our judgment, Swearengen, claims that Evers rejected the state-wide computer program saying it's best to be spent in urban areas like Madison and Milwaukee. == sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man.................................................................................................................................................................................. But Swearengen didn't provide convincing evidence to support his claim. The funds were not specifically transferred by Evers. Nothing in the message of the veto points to a shift from rural to urban, as chess suggests - let alone anything specific to Milwaukee and Madsen. Evers made ideological objections on the basis of how funding was allocated and his feeling that education dollars could best be spent.
