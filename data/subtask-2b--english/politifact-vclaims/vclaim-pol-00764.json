J.B. Pritzker signed legislation barring the sale of nicotine products to those under 21, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel pointed to results from a similar rule already in effect in the city.\n\"There\u2019s a lesson out of Chicago,\" he said. \"In the last eight years, we\u2019ve seen a 50% reduction in teen smoking. Largest drop in the United States of America.\"\nReducing teen smoking is something to boast about, but this isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve heard Emanuel declare an accomplishment to be not just good but stupendous by pumping it with air \u2014 or, in this case, smoke. In the past he\u2019s made exaggerated claims about the city\u2019s economic growth and about its school system, for instance, both of which we\u2019ve rated Mostly False.\nThe best-in-the-nation teen smoking rate claim holds up no better.\nStretching the facts\nFirst, it\u2019s important to note that Emanuel was referring only to changes in cigarette smoking over time and not electronic cigarette use, which federal research shows is driving an increase in the overall use of nicotine products among youth even as cigarette smoking falls.\nSo Emanuel\u2019s good news is tempered somewhat by national trends. That said, he is correct that in recent years Chicago has seen a decrease of roughly 50% in the share of teens who reported smoking cigarettes.\nThe results of a biennial youth behavior survey by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that 12.5% of Chicago high school students reported in 2009 that they had smoked a cigarette on at least one day within the past month. By the 2017 survey, the CDC found the comparable number had dropped to 6%.\nThat\u2019s progress, but nowhere near nation-leading progress. The CDC survey found bigger drops in teen smoking rates in at least nine other large urban school districts or counties.\nTeen cigarette use in Chicago fell 52% between 2009 and 2017, the CDC found. But in Los Angeles, for example, the CDC recorded a 75% decline. For Boston, the drop was 70%.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe teen smoking rate in Chicago for 2017 was well below the national average of 8.8%, but there, too, the CDC recorded even better numbers for several other big cities. In Los Angeles, less than 3% of high-schoolers said they smoked. In Boston the number was just slightly over 3% and in Philadelphia it was 3.5%.\nWe asked the mayor\u2019s office to explain his largest drop in the nation claim, but a spokesman for Emanuel responded with a statement that avoided a defense of his remarks.\nThe more than 50% decrease in teen cigarette smoking \"makes Chicago a national leader in the pursuit to create a tobacco-free generation,\" spokesman Patrick Kelly wrote in an email.\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that the decline in teen smoking in Chicago tracks with a broader downward trend. The CDC's survey results show that nationally, the share of teens who currently smoke cigarettes dropped by 55% between 2009 and 2017.\nOur ruling\nEmanuel said that Chicago\u2019s reduction in teen smoking over the last eight years is the \"largest drop in the United States of America.\"\nFederal data on cigarette usage among high schoolers tracks with the figure he cited for Chicago\u2019s decline. That same dataset, however, shows that Chicago is far from the nation\u2019s leader in reducing teen smoking. At least nine other major school districts or counties came out ahead.\nWe rate Emanuel\u2019s statement Mostly False.\n\nMOSTLY FALSE \u2013 The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00764"}
