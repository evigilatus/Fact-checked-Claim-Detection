The site has the name YoungKimforCongress.org, which makes it easy to misunderstand Cesneros' opposition site, Young Kim. But the content and logo of the site created by the Democrats -- \"just like Donald Trump\" -- is anything but flattering Kim, the Republican. The site has a lot to chew, but standing in front of Polyte Fact was a division of Kim's personal taxes. She says Kim is a tax fraud that she illegally demanded an annual $7,000 exemption for a house she didn't live in. \"Wheat\" and \"illegal\" are serious words. To understand them perfectly here, let's look at the facts, with a little excitement to start: the property taxes we're discussing are $387. If you own a house, you pay the property tax on it. However, many states grant tax relief to people living in their homes. This is called an exemption for the owner of the house or residence, which in California is relatively small. By claiming this, a homeowner in California can reduce the estimated value of his home by a maximum of $7,000 - saving the homeowner about $70 a year in actual taxes. Kim and her husband Charles owned a house in Orange County in La Habra and had a homeowner's exemption until the fiscal year ending 30 June 2015. But Kim moved to a different home in a different society, Fullerton, in late 2012, and in January 2013 she changed her voter registration to reflect that. She moved back to a third house, in Fullerton, in 2014. Kim and her husband still own the house in La Habra -- renting it as income property -- and got the homeowner's exemption. Under California law, homeowners are only supposed to get an exemption if they live at home. This means that Kim continued to receive an annual subsidy of $74 which she and her husband were not entitled to. After realizing this, Orange County offered two concessions against Kims for \"unsecured property taxes,\" one for $197.96, and the other for $189.39, on October 13, 2015. Such privileges usually include punishment and interest, Orange County Claude Parrish told us. The county lifted the concessions on September 30, 2016, after the kim was paid. Total penalty: $387. These basic facts, most of which were observed or made available through links on the Spof Kim web site, were independently confirmed by Politi Fact through Orange County Public Records, interviews and financial disclosure form submitted by Kim after her election to the California State Assembly in 2014. But none of these addresses were important: did Kim manage the county -- was it a tax fraud -- so that she could save $74 a year? Parrish, the county tax expert told us that the concessions should never have been issued. Parrish also said so in 2016, when the issue arose during Kim &apos; s failed campaign to re-elect the Council of State. Parish, whose office was non-partisan but republican in previous positions, issued a statement during that race, stating that Kim had notified his predecessor in 2014 \"that she no longer lived in the house in question as of December 2012 and was therefore not eligible for exemption from the owner of the house.\" Devin Nunes reported on January 10, 2021 in an interview on \"The Republicans have no means of communication\" after the Barler tech companies were cut off. \"Unfortunately,\" his statement continued, \"Notices from the province concerning this property were mailed to Ms. Kim at an old address and were not sent to her, a common problem when people moved. Because of its lack of fault, its property was mortgaged for a small amount of tax due. This is often the case for innocent taxpayers, such as Ms. Kim, and is a direct consequence of the failure of the United States to send the notices correctly. Mail service.\" In a phone interview, Parrish told us, \"This can happen to anyone.\" Parrish has struggled on this particular issue - thousands of concessions issued in very small amounts, which could be detrimental to the population's credit - for several years. He said that 62 per cent of the 331.45 concessions in 2015 were for $200 or less, many of which were the result of supervision or error. Parrish successfully paid for the California Bill 2017, which authorized the provinces to suspend the issuance of tax concessions if the amount due was $200 or less. No matter how much, does Kim owe money? If Kim notified the evaluator &apos; s office in 2014 of the movement in late 2012, this indicates that at least one year has passed before the appropriate notice was given. It was then complicated by the mail, as did the fact that, according to Kim's current campaign, she paid her property taxes through the real estate guarantee account on her mortgage. In the General Assembly race in Kim in 2016, her political opponent, Sharon Kuerk-Sylva, said that these were excuses that did not relieve Kim of her obligations as a tax payer. At that time, the Koerk-Silva campaign issued a critical statement by the retired tax adviser in Los Angeles District, Kenneth P. Han, who said: \"The law is clear. Non-receipt of notice from the United States The postal service does not exempt an individual from paying his taxes.\" Kim's current campaign says that this is a little too much. Ultimately, the debate is more than $74 a year, or $387 after sanctions and interest. The income tax campaign also noted on its fake Kim website that Kim and her husband owe $10,000 to $15,000 to the Tax Authority. This information comes directly from Kim's financial disclosure report this year as a candidate for the United States House of Representatives. Under creditors, $10,000 to $15,000 was recorded as due to the Tax Administration, with a description of \"statication of taxes due for 2009 and 2010.\" Patrick Mosetti, campaign manager Kim, told us that the debt was due to taxes due from her husband &apos; s self-employed consultant and a premium payment plan with the Tax Administration. That's totally legal. Our judgment in Cisneros' campaign says Kim is a tax fraud that \"I illegally demanded an annual $7,000 exemption for a house you didn't live in.\" The IRS debt is larger than the property tax, but there is no information showing that it has anything to do with fraud. \"Wheat\" means motive, and news stories used the word to describe people who deliberately violate home-based tax-saving laws -- usually save more than $74 a year. Nick Jordan, spokesperson for the Cesneros campaign, told us that the campaign used the word in general. Whether this was wrong or not, Kim had two concessions and owed $387 to the county as a result of an improperly registered exemption by the homeowner. The law is the law, as Kim's last opponent said. But it was a simple civil matter, and a case the current property judge says should not have resulted in any privileges. Cisnero focused on an annual reduction of $7,000 in the house valuation, not to mention on the Boof web site that it made a difference of $74 per year. That makes it look much worse than it used to be. With these elements combined, we often assess the claim as false.
