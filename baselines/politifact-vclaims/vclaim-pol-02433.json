Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., high-fived Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., following a controversial abortion vote.\n\"Heitkamp High-Fives Schumer After Voting Against 20-Week Abortion Ban,\" the headline reads.\nThe vote in question was to proceed to a motion that would make nearly all abortions after 20 weeks illegal and subject anyone who performed the procedure to prison time or fines. The 51-46 yea-to-nay vote fell below the filibuster threshold of 60 votes, and Heitkamp\u2019s vote was one of those nays.\nBut did Heitkamp follow up her vote with a celebratory high-five with the Senate minority leader?\nThe main image, a screen grab from C-SPAN, certainly makes it seem that way. But the video, which is embedded in the story, shows more of an awkward greeting than a crude celebration.\n\nThe footage shows Heitkamp walking into the chamber as she converses with Cory Booker, D-N.J.. She responds to the clerk\u2019s roll call in the negative, and resumes chatting.\nAs they speak, Schumer approaches Booker and Heitkamp, and Heitkamp catches his eye. They each wave hello with their hands up, and Heitkamp reaches her hand out to meet Schumer\u2019s as he lands at their side. They clasp hands, exchange a few inaudible words, and let go as Booker pats Schumer\u2019s shoulder. The vote was about halfway through, so the hand clasp was not in reaction to a final tally.\nTypical high fives involve slapping of two hands in celebration. This was a very gradual meeting of awkwardly waving hands.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They were greeting each other to say hello, as senators often do during votes,\" said Abigail McDonough, Heitkamp\u2019s communications director.\nJustin Goodman, Schumer\u2019s press secretary, confirmed the senators did not speak about the vote when they greeted each other.\nThe vote was held on a Monday night, so it was the first time a lot of the senators would have seen each other since the previous week.\nRob Port, the editor of the blog, did not provide any evidence that the hand-gesture was about the vote.\n\"Looked like a high five to me, but the video speaks for itself I think,\" Port said.\nThe clip was generated by a C-SPAN user, who titled it \"Heitkamp & Schumer High-Five Over Abortion Vote.\" Tom Campbell, Heitkamp\u2019s Republican challenger, posted the clip to his Facebook page three hours before the SayAnythingBlog post was published.\nOur ruling\nA SayAnythingBlog.com headline said, \"Heitkamp High-Fives Schumer After Voting Against 20-Week Abortion Ban.\"\nThe headline suggests the celebration of a pro-abortion victory, but that\u2019s not what the footage shows.\nThe video shows an awkward hand waving-turned-holding between Schumer and Heitkamp on a Monday night. Both senators said they did not mention the vote on the floor, and that they were simply greeting each other. Port provided no evidence that the two were celebrating the vote.\nWe rate this statement False.\n Share the Facts 2018-02-06 16:12:37 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  \"Heitkamp High-Fives Schumer After Voting Against 20-Week Abortion Ban.\"    Say Anything Blog North Dakota conservative political blogger https://www.sayanythingblog.com/entry/video-heitkamp-high-fives-schumer-voting-20-week-abortion-ban/   A blog post Monday, January 29, 2018 2018-01-29    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02433"}
