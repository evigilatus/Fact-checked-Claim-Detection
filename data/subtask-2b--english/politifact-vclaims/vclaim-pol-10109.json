The meeting was closed to the press, and there is no transcript of what was said. The Post story was based on interviews with people in the meeting.\n\nHere\u2019s the relevant excerpt:\n\u00a0\n\n\"If you want Israel to take risks, then its leaders must know that the United States is right next to them,\" Malcolm Hoenlein, the executive vice chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, told the president.\n\n\nObama politely but firmly disagreed.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Look at the past eight years,\" he said, referring to the George W. Bush administration's relationship with Israel. \"During those eight years, there was no space between us and Israel, and what did we get from that? When there is no daylight, Israel just sits on the sidelines, and that erodes our credibility with the Arab states.\"\n\n\nThe White House does not confirm that Obama said those words. There also has been no explicit denial.\n\nWhat he meant\n\nFurther into the Post story, deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes explained Obama\u2019s purpose in the meeting, in which he explained to the Jewish leaders his thinking about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and how he differed from Bush\u2019s approach.\n\n\"The case he was trying to make was that the United States will be a better partner to Israel if it has more credibility with the Arab states, that we will be a better, more useful friend to Israel if we have more friends in the Arab world,\" Rhodes said, according to the story.\n\nThe White House pointed us to several examples of how Obama is not distancing his administration from Israel. He and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have met nine times and spoken on the phone dozens of times. In July, Obama signed the Israel Security Act, a bill designed to increase security ties with the Jewish state, and boosted U.S. funding for Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system by $70 million.\n\nThe White House also pointed to statements from Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak on the two countries\u2019 relationship.\n\nNetanyahu, at the AIPAC conference in May 2011: \"Yesterday President Obama spoke about his ironclad commitment to Israel's security. He rightly said that our security cooperation is unprecedented. He spoke of that commitment not just in front of AIPAC. He spoke about it in two speeches heard throughout the Arab world. And he has backed those words with deeds.\"\n\nBarak, to CNN in July: \"This administration under President Obama is doing in regard to our security more than anything that I can remember in the past.\"\n\nSome interpretations\n\nWe talked to Danielle Pletka, a scholar with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, who said Romney\u2019s take was a \"fair paraphrase\" of Obama\u2019s reported words.\n\n\"It is the widespread perception that the president has in fact worked fairly assiduously to put daylight between the U.S. and Israel,\" she said, mentioning Obama\u2019s more hard-line stance on Israeli settlements and his comment to French President Nicolas Sarkozy about Netanyahu, saying, \"You're tired of him; what about me? I have to deal with him every day.\"\n\n\"I think it\u2019s a world view. I think that President Obama\u2019s world view is not one in which Israel plays a special role -- Israel is a country like any other, it causes us too much trouble in the Middle East, and the time has come to distance ourselves,\" Pletka said, adding that most Americans don\u2019t share that view.\n\nAaron David Miller, in a first-person piece for Foreign Policy magazine, wrote that when it comes to Israel, \"Obama really is different. Unlike (President Bill) Clinton and George W. Bush, Obama isn't in love with the idea of Israel. As a result, he has a harder time making allowances for Israeli behavior he doesn't like. Obama relates to the Jewish state not on a values continuum but through a national security and interest filter.\"\n\nReferring to the Post story, Miller wrote: \"Obama doesn't believe the \u2018no daylight\u2019 argument -- that is, to get Israel to move, you need to make the Israelis feel that America will stand by it no matter what. Quite the opposite: Obama appears to believe that Israel needs to understand that if it doesn't move, the United States will be hard pressed to continue to give it complete support.\"\n\nOn the other side of the argument, Natan Sachs, a scholar with the centrist Brookings Institution, said it\u2019s somewhat misleading for Romney to say that daylight is Obama\u2019s goal.\n\n\"It is true that President Obama, early in his tenure, tried to carve out a role for the United States as a broker for negotiations, airing differences in policy between the United States and Israel, especially on settlements. It is also true that this coincided with his attempt to regain U.S credibility in the Arab and Muslim world... But two important caveats should be made: once the attempt to restart negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians failed, the Obama administration has in fact stopped putting much pressure on the Israeli government on settlements. ... Second, the point of the policy was not to put \u2018daylight\u2019 per se, but rather to be forward about policy disagreements between Israel and the United States -- disagreements that the Bush administration shared, to some degree -- rather than attempting to hide this disagreements,\" Sachs wrote in an email.\n\nOur ruling\n\nRomney said that Obama said he would create daylight between the United States and Israel.\n\nIt\u2019s not as simple in this case as going to the tape to see what Obama said. The comment was reported secondhand by the Washington Post, based on anonymous interviews.\n\nRomney fairly characterizes a quote attributed to Obama, which the White House has not denied.
