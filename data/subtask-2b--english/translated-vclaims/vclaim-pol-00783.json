So when a quote comes from one of them who claims to praise the other, it turns on the eyebrows. This is about social media in a recent Facebook article, which Obama claims in 1991 \"the American dream is to be Donald Trump.\" The article was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) So, did Obama say that? No, not exactly. Obama did not literally say (or write) that \"the American dream is to be Donald Trump,\" but he referred to Trump in Harvard's paper as an example of American success. However, the tone was not entirely positive. Sharing the facts 2019-04-08 20:25:28 UTC Politic Fact 2 1 7 Politic Fact Rating: President Barack Obama once said, \"The American dream is to be Donald Trump\" on Facebook Tuesday, 2 April 2019 2019-04-02 reading more information in April 1991, just before Obama was about to graduate from Harvard Law School, he and fellow Robert Fischer co-authored a paper called \"Race and Rights Rhetoic.\" An extract of the unpublished paper was disclosed in Obama's 2017 \"Ringing Star: Making Barack Obama\" by David Garo: Here's the book extract. For the purposes of verifying these facts, we have bolded parts of the quote: \" (Americans have) an ongoing normative commitment to the ideals of individual freedom and movement, values that go far beyond the question of race in the American mind. The depth of this obligation may be rejected without warning due to the unfounded optimism of the average American - I may not be Donald Trump now, but you just have to wait; if I do not succeed, my children will do so. On January 12, 2021, he wrote in an Instagram article saying that Joe Biden remained silent about the violence in Black Lives-Mite protests. By Tom Kircher: January 16, 2021 (but) from us on the political left (often forgetting) the degree of alliance and consensus-building among American voters has necessarily preceded any major federal program to reform or restructure America's economic and political landscape. According to Garowe (at page 451 of his book), the paper raises the argument that discussing minority rights as if they were \"global\" rights could be counterproductive and that a practical shift towards \"the language of opportunity\" would better serve African Americans. Garowe writes, quoting Harvard's paper (direct quotations from Obama's bold paper again for our purposes): \"This chapter assesses the usefulness of the Bill of Rights...as a means of freeing blacks, because authors believe that this focus \"disabled, rather than facilitated, the achievement of \"black empowerment.\" After the publication of Gallo's book, the news outlets picked up the Trump clip, and while most of them explained the context of the words and provided the full excerpts in the articles, the headlines of these stories are still misleading. In 1991 we claimed on Facebook that Obama said that \"the American dream is to be Donald Trump.\" Obama mentioned Trump in the Harvard paper that he co-written with a friend. But the passage says, \"I may not be Donald Trump now, but just wait, if I don't succeed, my children will,\" pointing out Trump as an example of Americans' expectations that they will be financially safe in the future. So, yes, Obama referred to Trump as a financially stable person, but he did not say or write the words attributed to him on social media. The quote is inaccurate and exaggerated and out of context. We assess it wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00783"}
