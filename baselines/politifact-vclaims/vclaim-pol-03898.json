The 11-member City Council accepted her recommendation in May 2015 and Alter was eligible to begin her service a couple months later.\nWhen Gallo made her motion to remove Alter from the board, Gallo said she was acting after Alter refused to resign. On Aug. 4, 2016, Gallo\u2019s colleagues approved Gallo\u2019s request without discussion as part of the meeting\u2019s consent agenda, which typically consists of uncontroversial items that are passed in a single council vote.\n\"I asked Ms. Alter to resign from the Parks and Recreation Board because of her inherent conflict of interest due to her intention to run against me for City Council,\" Gallo said in an Aug. 4, 2016, statement. \"It would be difficult for her to represent both me and the District 10 office in good faith while actively campaigning against me.\"\nGallo made no mention then of Alter\u2019s attendance.\nFor this fact check, we reached out to Gallo\u2019s campaign \u00a0by phone and email, seeking the factual basis for her claim that Alter\u2019s \"F\" for attendance preceded her removal from the board. Gallo\u2019s campaign cited those two missed 2016 board meetings in an email to PolitiFact, defending the claim.\nSeparately, we checked on Alter\u2019s attendance history by reviewing meeting minutes for the 11-member parks board.\nFrom January to July 2016, the period claimed by Gallo, the minutes indicate the board had six meetings, and a subcommittee Alter served on also had six meetings. Alter missed two of each--meaning she missed one-third of the year\u2019s meetings.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut that\u2019s an incomplete accounting.\nThe year before, Alter was absent from her initial full board meeting on July 28, 2015, according to that meeting\u2019s minutes. Yet she was present at each of her next eight meetings of the year--from Aug. 25 through Dec. 8, 2015--including three committee meetings, according to respective meeting minutes.\nAll told then, Alter was present at 16 of 21 parks board or subcommittee meetings until her removal. That breaks out to a 76 percent attendance record, arguably a \u2018C\u2019 letter grade.\nWe wondered if the city in any way grades or ranks board members on attendance.\nAt our request, city spokesman David Green emailed us the city\u2019s log of attendance for the parks board; it didn\u2019t include attendance grades or such. Green said too that the city clerk\u2019s office, which tracks board and council absences, doesn\u2019t rank or grade members on attendance.\nOur ruling\nGallo said Alter \"got an F in attendance in 2016 as a Parks Board member and was removed by a unanimous vote of the Austin City Council.\"\nThis claim gets events flat wrong in that we found no evidence that Alter\u2019s removal from the board--which occurred at Gallo\u2019s behest--had anything to do with missed meetings.\nAustin volunteers who serve on city boards don\u2019t get graded on attendance. Still, if Alter were graded on her entire tenure rather than a cherry-picked stretch, she\u2019d merit a passing grade of \u2018C.\u2019\nWe find this claim incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!\n\nPANTS ON FIRE \u2013 The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.
