Could illegally cast ballots have handed North Carolina to Obama in 2008?\nNorth Carolina figures to be a toss-up again this year, after it narrowly went for Mitt Romney in 2012. A RealClearPolitics average of polling from the first half of October showed Hillary Clinton with a 3-point lead over Trump in the Tar Heel State.\nEvidence of illegal voting?\nElections expert Rick Hasen, a professor of law and political science at UC-Irvine, said Trump is wrong.\n\"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible,\" said Hasen, who runs the ElectionLawBlog.org website.\nBut what do Trump and his campaign say about the statement?\nAfter Trump\u2019s speech Monday, his campaign\u2019s co-chairman Sam Clovis defended Trump\u2019s argument in an interview with a radio show affiliated with the Boston Herald newspaper.\n\"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s irresponsible,\" Clovis said. \"I think it raises an issue.\"\nThat issue, he said, is some states have made it easier for immigrants living here illegally to get driver\u2019s licenses \u2013 and, he said, that makes it easier for them to vote. However, North Carolina does not allow such immigrants to get licenses at all, so it\u2019s unclear why Clovis brought that up.\nNevertheless, we did some digging and found what Trump or his speechwriters seemed to be citing \u2013 a 2014 op-ed from one of the newspapers Trump once\u00a0banned from his rallies, the Washington Post.\nIn it, two political science professors said they had studied how often immigrants \u2013 here legally or illegally \u2013 might vote in U.S. elections.\nTrump quoted from their study almost verbatim in his speech, although he did not mention that there are serious concerns over its validity.\nSignificant statistical errors?\nOn the Washington Post website, above the op-ed about the study, you see an editor\u2019s note that the study has earned at least three separate rebuttals, as well as a peer-reviewed article saying the data the study used doesn\u2019t provide evidence of what the study claimed.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJenna Wadsworth\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth Carolina Secretary of State Elaine Marshall \"has won more statewide races than probably anyone else alive.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Paul Specht \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe original study\u2019s authors have defended their work, but we have to ask: Is Trump citing a debunked study?\nThe main issue deals with sourcing and sampling. The authors of the study didn\u2019t do the survey work themselves but instead pulled it from data collected by the Harvard-affiliated Cooperative Congressional Election Study.\nHowever, two weeks after the study was first published in 2014, the CCES wrote a response that has advised researchers not to use its data in that way \u2013 because its data on non-citizens drew from a very small sample size of 339 respondents nationwide.\nThe CCES furthermore said that it wasn\u2019t specifically surveying non-citizen voting habits, so it didn\u2019t correct for errors in that portion of its survey \u2013 and that it believed 16 or 17 percent of the respondents mistakenly reported they were non-citizens, either because they were confused or simply clicked the wrong box on the online survey.\nThe CCES researchers repeated those concerns in another op-ed for the Washington Post, published this week after Trump resurfaced the old study that relied on their work.\nAmong the 339 supposedly non-citizen respondents, 38 (11.3 percent) said they voted. The researchers in the study that Trump cited were unable to confirm 33 of those votes, leaving them with five verified votes (1.5 percent).\nLike the political scientists who have called this study into question, we have a hard time using five (or even 38) anecdotes to extrapolate a scenario for the entire country,\u00a0involving millions of people. But for the sake of argument, we\u2019ll put that apprehension aside and look at the data.\nThere were approximately 650,000 immigrants in North Carolina in 2008, about a quarter of whom were citizens. That means there were approximately 487,500 non-citizen immigrants. Surely they weren\u2019t all adults, but let\u2019s pretend they were.\nIf 1.5 percent of them voted, that would mean 7,313 non-citizens voted in North Carolina in 2008. Obama won the state by about 14,000 votes, so even if every single one of them had voted for Obama, their illegal voting would not have been enough to sway the election.\nSo even using the widely criticized study\u2019s findings, in order to come up with a result that influenced the election you would have to: 1. Double their verified rate of voting, 2. Assume that no immigrants are under the age of 18, and 3. Assume that McCain received 0 percent of the non-citizen vote.\nWe simply don\u2019t think that\u2019s likely, and neither does at least one federal appeals court. Hasen, the election law expert, wrote in the Wall Street Journal this week that \"the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit concluded last month than only a \"tiny fraction\" of voters are non-citizens and that there is no evidence it is a serious problem.\"\nActual allegations in North Carolina are few and far between\nWe also checked with the N.C. Board of Elections, which said in a statement: \"We have no indication that thousands of non-citizens voted in the 2008 elections, and we don\u2019t believe that amount of potential voter fraud would have gone unnoticed or unchallenged.\"\nIn 2008, North Carolina reported 23 allegations of non-residents either voting or registering to vote. Elections board spokesman Pat Gannon said while the office currently tracks such allegations after referring them to the courts, it did not in 2008, so it\u2019s unclear how many of those 23 reported cases were actually illegal.\nScott Huffmon, a political science professor at Winthrop University, said the 23 allegations could include immigrants (legal residents as well as those living here illegally) as well as U.S. citizens from other states. He also that, in general, it would make no sense for an immigrant living in the U.S. illegally to try to vote.\n\"Would any rational person put themselves in jeopardy of being deported for the virtual zero probability of influencing an election?\" Huffmon said.\nOur ruling \nTrump said \"it\u2019s possible\" that Obama won North Carolina in 2008 because of non-citizens voting illegally.\nThere is no evidence to support that theory, and that\u2019s not for a lack of attention. A federal appeals court has looked into it, as has the N.C. Board of Elections, and both found nothing of concern. Political scientists also disagree with Trump. And\u00a0even if the study Trump was citing is valid \u2013 although many say it's not \u2013\u00a0it\u00a0still doesn\u2019t back up Trump's claim.\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/96c8274a-cbbd-4be5-b9dd-1afe2d6d2e19", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04104"}
