(You can watch a video of the incident here.)\nObama continued trying to speak, but the man continued yelling, saying at one point: \"You have a power to stop deportation for all undocumented immigrants in this country.\" The heckler was later identified as Ju Hong, 24, of South Korea.\nThe president replied, \"Actually, I don\u2019t. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re here.\"\nIn this standoff, the president is largely correct.\nWe covered much of this ground in a fact-check of Florida U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, who claimed that Obama could \"basically\" legalize all immigrants here illegally \"by the sign of a pen.\" We\u2019ll review the evidence here.\nIn the heckler\u2019s case, he appears to be talking about Obama issuing an executive order to stop deportations. But experts said action like that would likely violate the separation of powers.\nCongress determines the laws governing how a person can legally reside in the country, so Obama cannot give out green cards, paths to citizenship or permanent residency en masse, experts told us. And Obama does not have the authority to override laws simply by proclamation.\n\"Executive orders have tended to be quite focused, not open-ended over time,\" said Kevin Johnson, University of California Davis School of Law dean. \"Such an order would likely be subject to quite possibly successful legal challenge, with the claim being that legalization would be contrary to an act of Congress, namely the Immigration and Nationality Act.\"\nNow, Obama has taken some executive action.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn June 2012, amid stalled DREAM Act efforts, Obama announced a new administrative policy called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals that allowed undocumented immigrants who came to the country as children to apply for a renewable, temporary status that suspends deportation and allows them to work in the country. So far, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has approved at least 455,000 people for this form of deferred action.\nObama, however, has said he does not plan to go further. And experts say making the case would be difficult.\nIf he wanted to order a stay of deportations across the board, he would have to provide a strong justification, such as a lack of resources to do the job, said Robert Delahunty, a University of St. Thomas School of Law professor who co-authored an argument against the constitutionality of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.\n\"But he could do that only briefly, and only in what I\u2019d consider pretty extreme circumstances,\" Delahunty said.\nOn the other hand, the country\u2019s immigration laws grant Obama and the Department of Homeland Security lots of wiggle room in granting temporary work permits and refusing to widely deport people, said Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute. A widespread stay, though, would be \"a crazy scenario,\" he said.\nEven some of Obama\u2019s loudest critics on immigration policy don\u2019t think he would go that far.\n\"It could be done. Obama\u2019s gotten away with as much, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019d do it,\" said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that is for stricter immigration control. \"That would be a bridge too far even for the pusillanimous appeasers among Republicans in Congress.\"\nExperts told us they think it\u2019s more conceivable that Obama would chip away at the undocumented immigrant population little by little by building on the deferred action policy for children who came to the country as minors. An expansion would have to come with caveats, such as cut-off dates and clean criminal histories.\n\"It would be the mother of all political battles,\" said Carl Hampe, a private immigration lawyer who was counsel for the Senate subcommittee on immigration from 1983 to 1991 and worked for the Department of Justice under President George H.W. Bush. \"As a purely theoretical legal question, is there a plausible argument that the president has that legal authority? Some would argue yes.\"\nOur ruling\nWhile giving a speech in San Francisco, President Barack Obama was heckled and told he has the \"power to stop deportation for all undocumented immigrants in this country.\"\nOur experts say any executive action that sweeping would violate the separation of powers between Congress and the executive branch. Obama has taken some executive action to temporarily keep more undocumented immigrants in the United States, and likely could do more, but not to the permanent point that the heckler argues.
