The fourth highest unemployment rate when I entered is now close to the national average. We wondered: Is North Carolina now \"near the national average\" of unemployment? As it turns out, things have improved in the State, but they have not improved as much as Teal &apos; s suggested. We looked at data from the Bureau of Labour Statistics, the Government &apos; s official source of employment data. We found that in the last month available -- August 2014 -- the unemployment rate in North Carolina was 6.8%. This is much lower than in January 2011, when Thelis was the spokesperson for the Council of State - 10.4 per cent. This represents a decline of just over one third of its previous level. We're not saying he gets all the credit for that landing -- it simply happened during his tenure. On January 16, 2021, Jordan Rachel stated in Tweedda that the minimum wage of $15 per hour would raise the price of taco bill burrito to $38. By Bill McCarthy \u2022 20 January 2021, but despite this significant improvement in North Carolina's unemployment rate, it is an exaggeration to say North Carolina is \"near the national average.\" In August, the rate of North Carolina in August was 6.8 percent higher by 0.7 percentage points for the country as a whole, and 0.9 points higher than in September. (The national figures are released before the country-by-country figures.) It is difficult to say that it is \"near\" to the national average. In comparison, it took the State nine months this year to reduce its unemployment rate by 0.7 points, and it took North Carolina 11 months to drop 0.7 points to its current level. So the difference of 0.7 percentage points is a lot of space to make up for. If we look at the North Carolina arrangement among states, we will provide more details, but the result is not much better than the accuracy of Teal'c's claim. In the August state-by-state arrangement, North Carolina and Alaska are associated with the country's 38 best unemployment rates. This means that they are located in the weakest quarter of the states, and not somewhere around half. Our reign Tillis said that in North Carolina, \"now we're close to the national average\" of unemployment. He has a point that the State has significantly reduced the unemployment rate in the past few years, but he overestimates the state &apos; s proximity to the national average. In fact, North Carolina's unemployment rate is classified in the lowest quarter of the states. We value the claim half right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07176"}
