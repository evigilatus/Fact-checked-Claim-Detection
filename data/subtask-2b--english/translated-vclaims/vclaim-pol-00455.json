We haven't had a plant built in years, decades, actually. And now we have many plants built all over the United States.\" And we decided to look at what's going on with the car factories, and if it's been decades since the start of a new plant. The whole story is that the transformation is less obvious than he said, especially when the closing of factories is folded in. The White House Press Office referred to a list of recent investments in the automobile industry. The list included a completely new factory for the assembly of Toyota-Mazda in Huntsville, Alaa (due to its opening in 2021), as well as extensions of existing facilities, such as General Motors to re-equip the Michigan electric power plant and Hyundai, which is adding space to its facility in Alabama to streamline engine production. The Trump campaign had a similar list. Between these two projects, we have calculated eight expansion/reprocessing projects and two new assembly plants since 2017. The Trump statement could have referred to new stations making cars, or extensions of existing factories, some making cars and others making motors and other key components entering cars. Discrimination is important, because patterns over the past 10 years are different. Investments in existing factories have remained fairly stable since the recession in 2009. In 2010, General Motors announced $145 million for the reopening of the Detroit area factory. In 2014, Ford placed $500 million at the Ohio engine facility. In 2016, General Motors revealed about $790 million for the engine plant in Spring Hill, Tin. The investments in the new assembly plants place a higher bar. We found two lists of the activity of the vehicle assembly plant - one from James Robinstein's researcher at Miami University in Ohio and the other from the Michigan Automobile Research Centre. We have collected two sets of data, including when factories open and when car manufacturers announce their plans. With regard to openings, the figures in this table show a gap between 2010 and 2018. \"The absence of new assembly plants during most of the first decade of the twentieth century is due to two factors: recovery from the severe recession in 2008-2009 and focus on expanding production in Mexico,\" Rubenstein said. On January 13, 2021, the distinguished fact-checkers announced in a story in which General David H. Berger, the commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Pelosi's request to use the Marines to install security, and told her that we were \"not working for you.\" By Samantha Butterman, on January 17, 2021, between 2013 and 2016, car manufacturers opened six new assembly factories in Mexico. During that period, the focus in the United States was on existing plants. New plants are huge investments, but automobile manufacturers have invested billions of dollars after contraction to reprocess and reopen closed production lines. In 2015, Ford announced that she was putting $1.3 billion in her Kentucky truck factory. Between 2013 and 2015, General Motors allocated approximately $2 billion to the clustering plants in Flint and Hamtramk, Mitch. In view of the recent period, as shown in the table, a new plant was declared two years before Trump took office. It is expected that these two individuals, announced during his observation, will be opened by Toyota-Mazda Motts Krysler two years from now. Trump had a point when he said it was a long time since the opening of a new plant, but he went too far when he said it was \"contracts.\" This has been the case since 2010. Trump may want to take credit for any new activity, but Bernard Soysky with the Car Research Center told us that the vast global factors guide car manufacturers. \"with the huge capital spending required for each factory, and the time-makers carefully invest to have the capacity available during the high market size points,\" said Soysky. Or, as Rubenstein said, \"Carmakers work in a longer time horizon than politicians.\" But the plant holes tell only half the story. Closures are also important. General Motors ceased production at its factory, Lordstown, Ohio, in 2019, and declared that its plant in Hamtramek, Mitch, was scheduled to remain open until January 2020 only. The net profit in the hour of Trump can be one new assembly station. Our Governor Trump said that the United States had not seen a new car \"built years ago - indeed, for decades. And now we have many plants built all over the United States.\" It is unclear whether Trump includes plants that manufacture engines and other components, but this type of investment has remained fairly constant over the years, which is contrary to his view of new plants coming after decades of inactivity. With regard to assembly plants, its suspension is an extension. Nine years ago, a new assembly factory was opened in Tennessee. In 2015, Volvo announced that it would build and open a factory in South Carolina in 2019. So it wasn't \"contracts.\" Two other factories are in the process of being implemented. But on the other hand, one of the GM factories was closed during Trump's presidency, and another is scheduled to be closed. In general, Trump painted a picture of a transformation not supported by facts. We assess his claim mostly wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00455"}
