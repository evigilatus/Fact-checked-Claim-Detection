From there it made its way to Facebook, where it was flagged as part of the company\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nIn the days leading up to Biden\u2019s inauguration at the Capitol, we\u2019ve seen several claims that China interfered in the election. My Pillow CEO Mike Lindell, who recently met with Trump at the White House, told Axios that the country used machines from Dominion Voting Systems to do it.\nThose claims are not based in fact.\nAll 50 states and the District of Columbia have certified their election results, which Congress finalized on Jan. 7. There is no credible evidence that voter fraud affected Biden\u2019s win.\u00a0\nHere\u2019s how we know that:\n\n\nElection officials in every state have said there was no sign of significant voter fraud during the voting process.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and its election partners called the 2020 election \"the most secure in American history.\"\n\n\nFormer Attorney General William Barr said the Justice Department uncovered no evidence of widespread fraud.\n\n\nNot one of the 62 lawsuits that Trump and his allies filed in state and federal courts proved that voter fraud affected the election outcome.\n\n\nIn Wood\u2019s interview with the Patriotically Correct Radio Show, during which he also falsely claimed that COVID-19 is akin to the flu and a biological weapon, he cited John Ratcliffe, director of national intelligence.\nIn a Jan. 7 memo, Ratcliffe wrote that a classified assessment recently completed by the intelligence community undersold the extent to which China interfered in the 2020 election The memo cited a report from Barry Zulauf, analytic ombudsman for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence \u2014\u00a0a position tasked with upholding the objectivity of reports from the intelligence community. That report described a \"widespread perception in the workforce about politicization\" of information about foreign election interference.\nRatcliffe wrote that, in his view, intelligence analysts were treating similar actions from Russia and China differently. But he didn\u2019t \"confirm\" any reports that China orchestrated voter fraud in the U.S., as Wood claimed.\nIn a rumor control page on its website, CISA said that bad actors would not be able to change election results without being caught. Dominion, a voting technology company that was targeted by disinformation after the election, said on its website that it has no ties to the Chinese government. A statewide audit and hand recount in Georgia, which used Dominion technology, upheld the original machine vote tally.\nWe reached out to Wood for a comment, but we haven\u2019t heard back.\nHis claim is inaccurate. We rate it False.\nRELATED:\u00a0A note to our readers who think President Trump won", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19193"}
