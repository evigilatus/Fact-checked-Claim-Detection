Steve LaTourette has been weighted down in a congressional dispute over ballast water on the Great Lakes.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Boysko\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in a committee debate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe United States is the only industrialized, modernized country that does not already have a paid family medical leave program in place.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvasive species, like zebra mussels, round gobies and bloody red shrimp, have hitchhiked in ballast water that ships take on for stability in one body of water, and discharge elsewhere. The stowaways crowd out native species, cause structural damage, and spread disease.\n\nEveryone wants to crack down on invasive species, but LaTourette says the state of New York has gone too far by imposing new ballast water regulations on shippers that are so strict they can\u2019t be met by current technology.\n\n\"The problem with invasive species today in the Great Lakes isn\u2019t ballast water,\" LaTourette said.\n\nHe said he has talked with many people about the issue, including longshoremen, Canadian officials and others on the St. Lawrence Seaway, and noted that the U.S., Canadian and state governments have worked hard to improve ballast water treatment practices.\n\nAt the moment, he said the Asian Carp is the lakes\u2019 biggest invasive species threat. An electric barrier has been built to keep them from spreading into the lakes from the Mississippi River system.\n\nPolitiFact Ohio decided to check out LaTourette\u2019s claim.\n\nLaTourette, from Bainbridge Township in Northeast Ohio, and other foes of the new rules argue the scheduled imposition of the New York regulations in 2013 will effectively shut down the St. Lawrence Seaway, which allows ships from the Atlantic Ocean to reach the Great Lakes, costing thousands of shipping jobs.\n\nThis summer, LaTourette tried to pressure New York to change its rules by securing language in a spending bill that would block the state from getting any Environmental Protection Agency money until its ballast water policy is altered. He and GOP Rep. Bob Gibbs, a fellow Ohioan from Holmes County, also co-sponsored a measure, which is now part of a Coast Guard funding bill, that would set a nationwide ballast water policy instead of letting states do it themselves.\n\n\"Vessels involved in interstate and foreign commerce are mobile and cannot be expected to comply with potentially scores of inconsistent state requirements as they navigate from one jurisdiction to the next,\" Gibbs argued on the House of Representatives floor. \"These inconsistent state requirements will impose serious economic burdens on interstate and foreign commerce.\"\n\nNot everyone shares the views of LaTourette and Gibbs. Several legislators stuck up for New York, arguing that states should be permitted to establish more stringent standards in their own waters. The amendments they suggested were defeated when the House voted.\n\nPolitiFact Ohio checked with LaTourette\u2019s staff about his claim. They referred us to a study produced by the Canadian government\u2019s fisheries and oceans division, which says that since current ballast water regulations were introduced in 2006, \"no new invasive species attributed to ballast water release and transoceanic shipping in general have been recorded in the Great Lakes.\"\n\nBecause invasive plants and animals from foreign freshwater ports are most likely to thrive in the Great Lakes, ships that from abroad that travel to the Great Lakes must exchange fresh water in their ballast tanks with salt water while they are still in the ocean. That kills off any freshwater species that sneak into the ballast tanks. Marine organisms that enter the ballast tanks in the ocean don\u2019t survive when they\u2019re released into the Great Lakes\u2019 fresh water. Canadian regulations also require ships to rinse out their empty ballast tanks with salt water in the middle of the ocean to kill any lingering freshwater organisms.\n\nJordan Lubetkin, a spokesman for the National Wildlife Federation, is fighting LaTourette\u2019s efforts to relax New York\u2019s ballast water rules, contending the bill is a sop to the shipping industry that would leave the Great Lakes vulnerable to future invasions.\n\nBut he does not dispute the study\u2019s findings.\n\nWhile progress has been made to prevent ballast water from spreading invasive species between water bodies, \u00a0Lubetkin says more should be done. \u00a0He noted that more than 65 percent of the aquatic invasive species which got into the Great Lakes since the St. Lawrence Seaway\u2019s 1959 opening arrived in ballast water.\n\n\"One must only look at how one single invader\u2014the zebra mussel\u2014entered the Great Lakes through ballast water and disrupted the Lakes from top to bottom to understand that we need a zero tolerance policy toward new invaders,\" Lubetkin said. \"The people, communities and businesses that have picked up the tab for the biological pollution dumped into the Great Lakes deserve a solution that offers the strongest water quality protections to protect our Lakes, jobs, health and quality of life.\"\n\nAlthough invasive species are a serious problem in the Great Lakes, LaTourette does have research to back his assertion that they haven\u2019t been spreading through ballast water.\n\nOn the Truth-O-Meter, LaTourette\u2019s claim rates True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-12118"}
