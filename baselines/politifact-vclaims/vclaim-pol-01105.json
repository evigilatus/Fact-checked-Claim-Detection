He called for starting a \"dialogue\" between Democrats and Republicans on their often adverse views on gun restrictions.\nNortham\u2019s gun-control package, which also included universal background checks and limiting handgun purchases to one a month, was defeated Jan. 17 by Republican majorities in a Senate committee and, later, a House subcommittee.\nWe wondered whether Northam\u2019s statement - that extreme-risk bills have passed in other states with Republican legislatures\u00a0 and been signed by GOP governors - is accurate.\nThirteen states have extreme-risk laws, also called red-flag laws. They allow police - and usually, family members - to petition a court to order the temporary removal of firearms from a person who may be dangerous to himself or others. After a set amount of time, the weapon is either returned to the person or the court order is extended.\nSupporters say the laws can prevent violent crimes and suicides. Opponents say the laws allow\u00a0government seizure of firearms in violation of the Second Amendment. The National Rifle Association opposed the laws for many years, but in 2018 changed position and said it would back bills if they provide\u00a0due process and require\u00a0mental treatment for the person temporarily forfeiting his gun.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlena Yarmoski, Northam\u2019s press secretary, sent us a list of states with extreme-risk laws that were either signed by Republican governors or passed in states where both chambers of the legislature were controlled by the GOP.
