Clinton was asked by a fawning Judd about the creation of the Clinton Global Initiative -- which is, effectively, a subsidiary of the Clinton Foundation. Initiative projects\u00a0range from paying for technology so that\u00a0small stoves to charge cell phones, to loans for small businesses, to free Web ads to raise money for overseas development nonprofits.\nAs often happens with Clinton, he gave a sidewinder of an answer. But here\u2019s the relevant portion of his response for our purposes:\n\"The Clinton Global Initiative meets every year. Then we do one (meeting) just on the American economy, which we will continue to do until we reach full employment. We had one (meeting) in Hong Kong for Asia, which I had to suspend those while Hillary was secretary of state for good reason. In order to do one around the world and make the economics work and keep the entry fee fairly low, you have to have sponsors. And if your wife is secretary of state and you get sponsors in another country, they may be doing it just because they believe in it, but it opens up too many questions of conflicts of interest. So we suspended those.\n\"But if she leaves the State Department in January, then I expect we\u2019ll have one in 2013 in Latin America and then another shortly thereafter in Asia because they\u2019re interested in it.\"\nAs you can see, Scarborough\u2019s comments aren\u2019t out of thin air. But Clinton is talking specifically about the Clinton Global Initiative. That\u2019s an important distinction, it turns out, because of the specific guidelines set out by the Clintons when Hillary Clinton was nominated as secretary of state.\u00a0\nA bevy of initiatives\nThe Clintons (and we say Clintons to describe them as a group, but Hillary Clinton was walled off from the organizations as secretary of state) operate\u00a0several separate initiatives under the umbrella of the Clinton Foundation. \u00a0\nWhile Hillary Clinton ran the State Department, the foundation oversaw the Clinton HIV/AIDS Initiative, the Clinton Climate Initiative, the Clinton Guistra Sustainable Growth Initiative and the Clinton Hunter Development Initiative. (The last one had nothing to do with hunting. It was named for Scottish entrepreneur Sir Tom Hunter and focused on development projects in Rwanda and Malawi.)\nThe foundation still runs those different programs, although it has dropped the initiative label from some of them. The point is, the Clinton Global Initiative was one of a handful of programs under the foundation\u2019s umbrella.\nThe modus operandi of the Clinton Global Initiative is to act as a broker between donors and doers. It holds big meetings to bring together governments, donors, and non-governmental organizations with shared concerns. The initiative charges fees to join as members, seeks sponsors to hold these big meetings and then pushes members to make big dollar commitments to key projects.\nBrian Mittendorf, a professor of accounting at Ohio State University\u2019s Fisher College of Business who follows nonprofit filings, including those of the Clinton Foundation, said that most of the money never passes through the Clinton Global Initiative\u2019s hands.\n\"CGI (the Clinton Global Initiative) doesn't implement the projects but instead acts as a \u2018facilitator\u2019 to match donors and get commitments to action,\" Mittendorf said. \"So, those commitments are not reflected as donations to the Clinton Foundation or CGI.\"\nTo get an idea of the contrast, in 2011, the global initiative had $26 million in revenues, but boasted that it secured commitments of $7.39 billion for projects that would roll out over many years.\nThe promises of the Clintons and the memorandum of understanding \nSo now we get to the Clintons \"self-pronounced\u00a0guidelines.\"\nWhen Hillary Clinton was nominated by Barack Obama as secretary of state in 2008, the Clinton Foundation instantly emerged as a stumbling block to her confirmation.\nThe Obama transition team attempted to deal with the possible conflicts of interest with a memorandum of understanding between the Clinton Foundation and the new administration. That memo created different requirements for the Clinton Global Initiative and other Clinton entities.\nAccording to the memorandum, the Clinton Global Initiative would be spun off as a separate nonprofit entity that could take no money from any foreign government. In addition, the Clinton Global Initiative agreed not to\u00a0hold any big meetings outside the United States.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe other Clinton programs and\u00a0initiatives could continue to accept money from foreign governments, but they had to report new donors or any existing government donor that decided to \"increase materially its commitment.\"\n\n\n\n\nMemorandum terms\nClinton Global Initiative\n\n\nMemorandum terms\nClinton Foundation and other Clinton subsidiaries\n\n\n\n\nNo donations from foreign governments\n\n\nCan accept donations from foreign governments, increased reporting requirements\n\n\n\n\nNo large meetings outside the United States\n\n\nForeign meetings allowed\n\n\n\n\nThis, again, is key, because Clinton was speaking only of the Clinton Global Iniative in his 2012 remarks.\nClinton Foundation spokesman Craig Minassian said the global initiative was treated differently because the initiative mainly brought funders together. As such, the global initiative did not need to collect money directly from foreign governments.\nIn contrast, Minassian said, a program like the Clinton HIV/AIDS Initiative -- now called the Clinton Health Access Initiative -- ran projects that delivered health care to people in developing countries. \u00a0\"You couldn\u2019t stop the money for AIDS because millions of people depended on that for their drugs,\" Minassian said. \"Those were programs we actually implemented. No one wanted to interrupt that because it would make no sense.\"\nSo why would the Clinton Global Initiative have any need at all for funds from foreign governments? Minassian said such help made large foreign meetings possible.\n\"You need to be invited. You need additional police and security,\" Minassian said. \"The host country is a key sponsor. This is not like holding a meeting at the Sheraton in New York City.\"\nMinassian said that after a meeting in December 2008 in Hong Kong, the program limited its annual gatherings to New York City from 2009 to 2012, the years Hillary Clinton headed the State Department. The first meeting outside America took place about 10 months after she left. It was held December 2013 in Brazil.\nForeign money did go to the Clinton Global Initiative\nThe restriction on the global initiative applied specifically to foreign governments. However, the initiative could and did accept donations from foreign donors (Scarborough just said foreign donations, not donations from foreign governments).\nThere are two ways to support the initiative. Membership costs $20,000 and comes with a ticket to go to the annual meeting. Sponsors pitch in substantially more to help pay for the meetings themselves. In return, they get publicity, multiple tickets to the meeting and other perks like their own meeting room at the annual gathering.\nThe organization\u2019s Internal Revenue Service filings show total revenues of $28.2 million in 2012 and $26 million in 2011. The split between member fees and sponsorships is unclear, but Minassian said those are the only two sources of revenues.\nIn 2011, foundations backed by Ukrainian businessman Victor Pinchuk and Dubai-based Indian Sunny Varkey helped fund the annual meeting in New York. So did the French bank Credit Agricole and Indo Gold, an Australian mining company with investments in India, Africa and Germany.\nDuring Hillary Clinton\u2019s confirmation hearings, senators raised concerns about any foreign entity, government or private, making donations to the Clinton Foundation. The policy for the Clinton Global Initiative that emerged from the memorandum only banned accepting funds from foreign governments, along with no longer holding large meetings outside America.\nSince Hillary Clinton left the State Department, the governments of Germany, Saudi Arabia, Australia, Oman, and others have given money to the global initiative. Minassian said that now that she is running for president, that will stop, as will plans to hold gatherings overseas.\nOur ruling\nScarborough accused Bill Clinton of hypocrisy, saying the former president violated his own self-pronounced guidelines by accepting foreign donations while his wife was secretary of state. As evidence, Scarborough pointed to comments made by Clinton in 2012.\u00a0\nBut Clinton's comments were more narrowly focused than Scarborough let on.\nClinton said the Clinton Global Initiative didn\u2019t take donations from foreign entities while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state\u00a0because it opens questions of conflicts of interest.\nThat prohibition is outlined in a\u00a0memorandum of understanding signed by the foundation and the Obama administration. There is, as of yet, no accusation that the initiative broke that term of the agreement.\nAs far as the other Clinton programs and\u00a0initiatives, the Clintons were permitted to collect\u00a0donations from foreign governments. But they did agree to increased reporting requirements, though the\u00a0Clinton Foundation says it failed to meet the reporting requirements in some cases.\nIn short, there are serious questions about how the Clinton Foundation reported foreign government donations.\nBut Bill Clinton\u2019s 2012 interview provides little extra fodder -- beyond a juicy soundbyte -- for those questioning the Clintons\u2019 decision to take foreign government money.\nWe rate the claim Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06450"}
