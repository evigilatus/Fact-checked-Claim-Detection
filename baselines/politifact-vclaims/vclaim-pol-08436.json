Johnny Isakson, among others, is out there saying. And Isakson is pointing fingers at a specific type of school -- liberal arts colleges.\n\"Career academies are the future,\" Isakson said at a Dec. 4 town hall meeting in Coweta County. \"Fifty-three percent of graduates from liberal arts academies couldn\u2019t find employment, but almost 89 percent who graduated from technical schools did so.\"\nIsakson repeated the claim about liberal arts school students in a visit to The Newnan Times-Herald on the same day.\nThose are steep unemployment statistics for college graduates of any stripe. PolitiFact Georgia decided to do some homework on the senator\u2019s numbers.\nIsakson based his statement on data developed by The Associated Press in 2012 with help from researchers. Those numbers show 1.5 million adults, or 53.6 percent of bachelor\u2019s degree-holders under age 25, were either jobless or underemployed in 2011.\nIn both Georgia appearances, Isakson applied the worrisome AP statistics to liberal arts school graduates. But the AP report was about all graduates, not any specific degree holders.\n\"I am certain that Sen. Isakson\u2019s intent was to convey the general message of the AP study,\" said Lauren Culbertson, the senator\u2019s deputy communications director.\nIsakson is hardly the first to cite the AP report, which some education researchers say overstated the difficulties that graduates were having finding employment or landing jobs that matched their skills.\nJust a day before he visited Coweta County, Isakson attended the Cobb County Economic Forecast breakfast, where Albert Niemi Jr., nationally acclaimed dean of the Cox School of Business at Southern Methodist University, gave a speech that referenced a 2012 article in The Atlantic on the AP findings.\nNiemi said about half of the college graduates between 2007 and 2012 were unemployed or underemployed. He used the findings to make the case that a college diploma isn\u2019t worth what it once was and that today\u2019s graduates need teachable \"hard skills,\" if they hope to get hired.\nIsakson left the Cobb breakfast with a hard copy of Niemi\u2019s PowerPoint presentation, Culbertson said.\nAnthony P. Carnevale, director and research professor at the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce, said the 2012 report \"grossly misrepresents the truth\" about college grads in general.\nThe unemployment rate for college graduates is under 5 percent now, Carnevale said. In 2011, it was about 7 percent for new college graduates, substantially less than the unemployment rate for high school graduates, he said.\nIt was that way throughout the Great Recession, Carnevale said.\n\"College unemployment went up, but much less than the unemployment rates of non-college graduates,\" he said. \"The value of college is still high.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther educators and researchers say they see nothing to reflect major struggles for liberal arts school graduates as opposed to other degree holders.\nThe Association of American Colleges and Universities is about to release a report that suggests the unemployment rate for liberal arts graduates is quite low and not much higher than other graduates, said Debra Humphreys, the association's vice president for policy and public engagement.\nEnrollment has been \"strong\" at the public liberal arts colleges and universities that are part of the North Carolina-based Council of Public Liberal Arts Colleges, said Bill Spellman, the consortium\u2019s director.\n\"Students and parents are feeling that that well-rounded education is going to be an advantage, if not initially, then midway in their careers,\" Spellman said.\nThey see the importance of having \"those transferable skills of critical thinking, writing and speaking and of being able to be nimble for jobs that haven\u2019t even been created,\" he said.\nColleges throughout Georgia offer bachelor of arts degrees.\nAnd at Georgia College in Milledgeville, the state\u2019s only recognized public liberal arts college, 78 percent of students in the Class of 2012 reported having jobs within three months of graduation, said Brittiny Barber Johnson, the college\u2019s manager of media relations.\nThe results were based on responses from 241 of the 1,136 undergraduates who received their degrees in May 2012, Johnson said. Of the students who responded, 43 percent said they were working in a job \"highly related\" to their major, she said.\nBut to people who listened to Isakson at a town hall meeting at the Coweta campus of West Georgia Technical College, a much different picture emerged. Isakson told the audience 53 percent of graduates from liberal arts academies weren\u2019t finding jobs.\nBy contrast, he said nearly 89 percent of tech school graduates had landed jobs.\nMike Light, longtime spokesman for the Technical College System of Georgia, said Isakson's numbers for the state\u2019s technical schools appear spot-on. Officials at individual technical schools are seeing about 90 percent of their graduates finding jobs and, systemwide, that number is about 85 percent, Light said.\n\"They\u2019ve got the in-demand careers,\" he said.\nSo where does that leave us?\nIsakson said that 53 percent of graduates from liberal arts colleges can\u2019t find a job. On the face of it, he incorrectly quoted an AP report, which makes no attempt to single out liberal arts graduates and their ability to find work. He also failed to mention that the 53 percent figure included not only jobless grads, but also many people who were finding jobs, albeit in lower-paying positions than one might expect.\nAnd even that report is viewed with suspicion in some quarters.\nSome college graduates are having trouble finding work. Isakson is correct about that.\nBut his statement misquotes numbers in a study that itself has been questioned.\nWe rate Isakson\u2019s statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08436"}
