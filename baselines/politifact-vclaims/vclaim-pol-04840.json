The group wants an extension of the state\u2019s red light camera program, a pilot program for speeding cameras on Roosevelt Boulevard and the use of radar detection by police. \u00a0\u00a0\nBefore the meetings in Harrisburg happened, Penn Live published an editorial authored by Tom McCarey criticizing the Bicycle Coalition\u2019s desire to push for radar use, the red light camera program and the speeding camera program. McCarey is a member of the drivers\u2019 advocacy group the National Motorists Association and lives on the Main Line.\nHe wrote, \"Never mind that no red light camera, no speed camera, nor any radar gun has ever stopped one accident from occurring.\"\nThe editorial itself felt a little out of place. A member of one lobbying organization was writing critically about an opposing lobbying organization. But was McCarey\u2019s claim that these types of technology have prevented a single accident from occurring legitimate?\nThe short answer is no. While the exact pros and cons of these technologies are up for debate, multiple studies show they have prevented accidents in numerous cities and certainly at least one accident.\nMcCarey said he got his information from National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) statistics and did not respond when asked to provide the specific data. The answer to whether such data to backup his claim exists is also no. \u00a0\n\"NHTSA has never made this untrue statement at all,\" said NHTSA spokesman Jose Ucles. \"Neither does it agree with it.\"\nThe organization has released a compendium of 13 studies looking at red light cameras and speed cameras, among other things. The studies the NHTSA regarded as the best showed a 20-to-25 percent reduction in injury crashes at sites with speed cameras. For red light camera studies, which the NHTSA did not regard as highly as the speed camera studies, there were reductions in overall crashes from 9-to-18 percent and 21-to-51 percent for injury crashes.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPat Toomey\n\n\nstated on January 19, 2021 in a hearing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere will be several thousand dollars in payments going to families with six-figure incomes who\u2019ve had no income interruption whatsoever.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jessica Calefati \u2022 January 21, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDominique Lord, a professor at Texas A&M, was commissioned by the Chicago Tribune to study the efficacy of red light cameras installed throughout the city. The study found no significant reduction in crashes at intersections where five or fewer crashes had been occurring annually but at intersections with five or more annual crashes there had been a reduction. It found certain types of injury accidents, such as right angle T-bone crashes, had declined while rear-end injury crashes had increased. \u00a0\u00a0\n\"Has it at least saved one crash, a red light camera?\" Lord said. \"There\u2019s no doubt about that.\"\nLord added red light cameras should only one tool among many that can be utilized to cut down on accidents.\n\"Red light cameras and speed cameras change the behavior of people,\" he said. \"By changing the behavior of people you (decrease) risk.\" \u00a0\u00a0\nOur ruling \nTom McCarey wrote in a Penn Live editorial the technologies being pushed for by the Bicycle Coalition of Greater Philadelphia -- an extension of the state\u2019s red light camera program, a pilot program for speeding cameras on Roosevelt Boulevard and the use of radar detection by police -- would make highways more dangerous and not stop a cyclist from being hit. At one point, he wrote Never mind that no red light camera, no speed camera, nor any radar gun has ever stopped one accident from occurring.\" \u00a0\nBut multiple studies have shown crashes have been reduced in areas where red light cameras and speed cameras are used. Dominique Lord, who completed a study that questioned the efficacy of red light cameras, said the cameras have prevented at least one crash. \u00a0\u00a0\nWe rate the claim Pants On Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04840"}
