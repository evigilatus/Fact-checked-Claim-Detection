For 2009, Cantor\u2019s number is right, Scissors said.\n\nBut using the latest annual numbers from 2010, he\u2019s off just a bit.\n\n\"For 2010, it\u2019s more like two and a half to one (advantage for the U.S.),\" Scissors said.\n\nWe asked Cantor\u2019s office where he got his information for the statement. Megan Whittemore, a Cantor spokeswoman, cited numbers from the World Bank, showing that U.S. GDP in 2010 was about $14.6 trillion while China\u2019s GDP was nearly $5.9 trillion.\n\n\"So the U.S. economy is about 2.5 times the size of China\u2019s economy, but the congressman rounded up to three,\" Whittemore said in an e-mail.\n\nCantor is not alone in making the claim that the U.S. economy is outpacing China\u2019s by a 3-to-1 ratio.\n\nIn a Jan. 19, 2011, joint news conference with Chinese President Hu Jintao, President Barack Obama said the U.S. economy is still three times larger than China\u2019s, according to a USA Today blog post.\n\nA March 11, 2011, report from the Congressional Research Service said that after three decades of brisk economic growth, China has the second largest economy in the world behind the United States. But the report added that despite China\u2019s rise, \"the United States\u2019 economy is three times larger than China\u2019s.\"\n\nBut that\u2019s not the end of the story.\n\nThere are different ways of measuring a country\u2019s Gross Domestic Product. One way is to compare each country\u2019s GDP using nominal exchange rates that convert China\u2019s economic data into U.S. dollars, according to a 2007 Congressional Research Service report.\n\nIt\u2019s by that measure that the U.S. economy is three times bigger than China\u2019s.\n\nBut that Congressional Research Service report noted there\u2019s been considerable debate among economists over the actual size of China\u2019s economy. Many economists, the CRS noted, contend using the nominal exchange rate significantly understates the size of the Chinese economy.\n\nAnother way to gauge GDP is to use purchasing power parity, or PPP, a measurement that converts foreign currency to U.S. dollars based on that currency\u2019s purchasing power, the CRS report states. That measurement gives a huge boost to China\u2019s GDP, making it much closer to the size of U.S.\n\nData from a September 2011 report from the International Monetary Fund said that when measured on a purchasing power parity basis, China\u2019s 2010 GDP was about $10.1 trillion, while the U.S. was at $14.5 trillion. By that gauge, the U.S. economy is only 30 percent larger than China\u2019s.\n\nThe Central Intelligence Agency\u2019s World Factbook puts more stock in measuring China\u2019s economy by using the purchasing power parity measure. It notes that measuring China\u2019s GDP by the lower official exchange rate understates the China\u2019s output compared to the rest of the world.\n\n\"In China\u2019s situation, GDP at purchasing power parity provides the best measure for comparing output across countries,\" the CIA\u2019s factbook states.\n\nBut using that GDP larger measure also has drawbacks, Scissors wrote in an April 2011 report. He said that purchasing power parity estimates change over time, noting that the World Bank cut the size of its 2005 purchasing power parity GDP estimate for China by 40 percent.\n\nSince 2005, Chinese inflation has outpaced that in the U.S., meaning the latest purchasing power measurements are out of date, Scissors wrote. He added that measuring GDP by that method overstates Chinese GDP.\n\nAnd we should also note that the 2007 Congressional Research Service report urged caution in using purchasing power GDP estimates for China, noting the prices of many goods and services in that country are distorted due to price controls and government subsidies.\n\nOur Conclusion:\n\nCantor said that the U.S. economy is three times the size of China\u2019s. By a standard and commonly-used measure of Gross Domestic Product, he\u2019s pretty close. Annual figures from 2010 show the U.S. economy is two and a half times the size of China.\n\nThat gives credibility to what Cantor is saying.\n\nBut by a second measure, adjusting for purchasing power, the U.S. output is still larger than China\u2019s, but the gap is much smaller. The U.S. economy by that score is only one-third larger than China\u2019s.\n\nNeither set of statistics is universally accepted as the only way to gauge the size of China\u2019s output. Both measures garner support and criticism from analysts.\n\nWe rate the claim Mostly True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11987"}
