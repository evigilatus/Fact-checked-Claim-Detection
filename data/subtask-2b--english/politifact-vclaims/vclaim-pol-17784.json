Then he said: \"I wish we taught more in our schools about the Islamic faith.\"\nBiden said more than that, but the backlash on social media didn't catch it. Conservative activists, including Charlie Kirk, tweeted out the comment and went on to say Biden didn\u2019t support prayer or studying the Bible in schools. One former Republican candidate called him anti-Christian. Biden is a lifelong Roman Catholic.\nOn Facebook, a text post quoted Biden incorrectly as saying: \"We need to teach our children the ISLAMIC FAITH in our schools!\"\nThe misquote left out important context from the rest of Biden\u2019s speech and his campaign as a whole.\nBiden said he wished schools taught not only the Islamic faith but \"all the great confessional faiths.\" He also said that he is interested in theology and \"we all come from the same root here in terms of our fundamental, basic beliefs,\" referencing his own Catholic background.\nHis reference to \"confessional religions\" includes different denominations of Christianity, Judaism\u00a0and Islam, which are religions that each have their own statements of faith, sometimes called a confession.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.

He said the lessons he learned from a Catholic community led him to public service.\nBiden said in 2005 that he supports rigidly upholding a separation of church and state.\u00a0\nOur ruling\nThe Facebook post claimed that Biden said, \"We need to teach our children the ISLAMIC FAITH in our schools!\"\nHe didn\u2019t say the quote. At the summit, Biden said that Islam should be studied from a theology perspective, not that students should be taught Islamic faith. He also went on to include that all \"great confessional religions'' should be talked about more in schools.\nWe rate this False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17784"}
