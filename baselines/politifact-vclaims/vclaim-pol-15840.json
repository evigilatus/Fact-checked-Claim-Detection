First, a starting point. Biblical scholars may quibble about the actual birth date of Jesus Christ, but we're going to go with the fairly  commonly accepted theory  that it was around 4 B.C. That's right, it would mean Christ was actually born \"Before Christ.\"   Add that to Anno Domini time, and you come to 2012 years since the birth of Christ.   So here goes our math: 2,012 times 365 (yes, we are aware there are leap years ... don't be like that) times $1,000,000. A: $734 billion (give or take a few hundred million).   The stimulus package is actually short of $1 trillion too, $819 billion. But that's still more than a million bucks a day since the day Jesus was born.
