(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nNeedless to say, there would have been massive news coverage, long before any trial, of such a crime and Clinton being implicated in it.

A court hearing was held on whether Clinton should be forced to give a deposition in a lawsuit that is seeking emails and other records regarding the attack, which killed the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans.\nAs for the 30,000 emails, as we\u2019ve reported:\u00a0\nClinton exclusively used a private email address while serving as secretary of state from 2009-13. Because she didn\u2019t use the government email system, the State Department didn\u2019t have her emails on hand when the House Select Committee on Benghazi asked to see them. So in 2014, Clinton\u2019s lawyers combed through her private server and turned over about 30,000 work-related emails to the State Department and deleted the rest, which Clinton said were about personal matters.\u00a0\nAn employee managing her server deleted 33,000 of Clinton\u2019s emails. The FBI found no evidence that the emails were deleted deliberately to avoid any subpoena or other requests.\nThe statement is false and ridiculous.
