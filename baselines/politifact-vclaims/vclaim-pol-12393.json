Kay Bailey Hutchison that Perry was for the Wall Street bailout before he was against it.\n\nHutchison said in a Texas gubernatorial debate that Perry signed a letter sent to members of Congress on the day the Senate was scheduled to vote on the bailout bill, urging lawmakers to \"pass an economic recovery package.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\"You wrote a letter to Congress saying pass this bill, we need to shore up the financial markets,\" Hutchison said. \"\u2026Governor, you asked for it too. You were for it before you were against it.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIn the debate, Perry conceded that he co-wrote a letter with West Virginia Gov. Joe Manchin. But, he said, he and Manchin \"thought you were smart enough to understand what we were talking about--stop the spending and cut the taxes.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\"Governor,\" Hutchison replied, \"that\u2019s not what the letter said.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\"I wish we\u2019d made it a little clearer for you,\" Perry said.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nPerry probably could have made it clearer for everybody.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThis much is certain: On the morning of Oct. 1, 2008, the Republican Governors Association and Democratic Governors Association publicized a three-paragraph letter signed by their respective chairmen, Perry and Manchin, stating: \"We strongly urge Congress to leave partisanship at the door and pass an economic recovery package ... If Congress does not act soon, the situation will grow appreciably worse.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe letter doesn\u2019t explicitly endorse the plan then before the Senate. But no other plan was in play that day amid national fears of an economic collapse. And The Associated Press cast the governors' letter as part of a frantic national push for the $700 billion bailout of Wall Street sought by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and President George W. Bush.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nLater the same day, Perry issued a contradictory-sounding second statement, partly headlined: \"On Protecting Taxpayers.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\"In a free market economy,\" Perry said, \"government should not be in the business of using taxpayer dollars to bail out corporate America.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAsked to clarify at the time what Perry wanted the Senate to do, his spokeswoman, Allison Castle, demurred. \"The senators have to make their own decisions,\" Castle said.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAsked in 2009 about Perry's dual messages, Perry spokesman Mark Miner saw nothing confusing. Miner said Perry simply favored tax and spending cuts over bailouts.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\"You call on Congress to take action, nine times out of 10, the action they take is wrong,\" Miner said.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAfter the Republican gubernatorial debate, we sought out Manchin for his take on the letter. In a comment delivered by a spokesman, Manchin said: \"You had to look at the situation our country was facing then. What we were urging was for Congress to work together in a bipartisan effort, and to follow the lead of the governors ... to move the states ahead. That effort continues today.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAt the time of the Senate action in 2008, Manchin said he supported his state's two Democratic senators, Robert Byrd and Jay Rockefeller, who voted for the Wall Street package. But he too sounded a contradictory note: \"I do not support a bailout. Nobody supports bailing somebody out on the backs of working people \u2026 for someone to profit on Wall Street.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAll in all, it's easy to see the rationale for charging Perry with being for the legislation. The Manchin-Perry letter urged action on the very day the Senate was poised to take up the bailout package.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nStill, Perry is correct that the joint letter didn\u2019t explicitly advocate the Senate plan. Also, his second Oct. 1, 2008, statement could be taken as a timely signal he didn\u2019t want Congress to rescue Wall Street the way it did.\n\nWe rate Perry\u2019s claim Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-12393"}
