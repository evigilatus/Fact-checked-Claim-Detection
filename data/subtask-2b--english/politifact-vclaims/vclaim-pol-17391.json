He\u2019s also a veteran, a millennial, an Episcopalian and left-handed.\nBut is he a dog killer? No.\nA fake newspaper clipping, sometimes alongside a photo of a teenage Buttigieg, is going around the internet claiming he was arrested in the late 1990s for killing several dogs.\n\n\u00a0\nSeveral Facebook posts shared the clip and asked: \"Why won\u2019t anyone discuss why a teenage Buttigieg strangled 5 dogs?\"\nBut the \"story\" was created using the Newspaper Clipping Generator, an online tool that allows people to produce images of news snippets. In this case, the clip implicates a real news source, the South Bend Tribune, which never published the story.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.
