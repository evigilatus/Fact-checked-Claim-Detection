This could be the outcome of a nationwide lockdown that lasted months, but one Facebook post is attributing it to a larger medical conspiracy.\nA Facebook post from May 26, 2020, claims that \"Italy has allegedly discovered covid is not a virus, but a bacterium. It clots the blood and reduces the oxygen saturation from dispersing throughout the body.\" It goes on to explain that the Italian Ministry of Health \"went against the World Health Organization's \u2018law\u2019 that no bodies receive autopsies,\" leading to its discovery of the bacterium.\nIt was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nLet\u2019s break down the three main claims:\n\n\"Italy has allegedly discovered covid is not a virus, but a bacterium. \"\n\nThis is wrong.\u00a0\nCOVID-19 is a disease caused by the virus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\nBacteria and viruses can create similar symptoms and spread through human-to-human contact, but they are different biologically.\nBacteria can replicate without a host cell, but viruses require some kind of host to replicate, explained Emily Bruce, a faculty scientist at the University of Vermont\u2019s Larner College of Medicine. Bacteria can replicate themselves because they have developed DNA and are considered a living organism, while viruses usually contain RNA.\nA late February study analyzing samples from nine new COVID-19 patients found that the disease possessed a \"single strand, positive-sense RNA genome,\" which is a characteristic of coronaviruses and not bacteria. Its genetic makeup was similar to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndromes. It was distantly related to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which are both coronaviruses that have caused large outbreaks before.\u00a0\nThis established the cause of COVID-19 as a virus, as a bacterium would not genetically match with these other coronaviruses.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 25, 2021 in a blog post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWHO now saying you do not need to wear a mask.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItaly\u2019s Ministry of Health still identifies the cause of COVID-19 as a coronavirus on its FAQ page.\n\n\"It clots the blood and reduces the oxygen saturation from dispersing throughout the body.\"\n\nThere is some evidence of blood-clotting problems from COVID-19, but they\u2019re most likely caused by lung complications.\u00a0\nStudies from the Netherlands and France have found a connection between severe COVID-19 and blood clots. The French study found that 23 out of 100 patients with a severe case of COVID-19 had blood clots in their pulmonary artery, which carries blood from the heart to the lungs to be oxygenated.\nRichard Watanabe, professor at the University of Southern California\u2019s Keck School of Medicine at, agreed that there is new evidence that COVID-19 can cause blood clots and other blood complications. This could be attributed to how \"people infected with COVID-19 develop pneumonia, which impedes breathing and oxygen saturation.\" Watanabe said that there needs to be more research on COVID-19 and clots and embolisms, especially with an increase in Kawasaki disease-like symptoms in young COVID-19 patients.\nRELATED: Top 10 uncertainties about the coronavirus\n\n\"They went against the World Health Organization's \u2018law\u2019 that no bodies receive autopsies.\"\u00a0\n\nThis is inaccurate. There is no recorded announcement from the World Health Organization that autopsies should not be conducted on deceased COVID-19 patients. In fact, the organization released guidance this month on how to perform such an autopsy safely.\nThe first English-language autopsy report on COVID-19 patients was done in Oklahoma, and the findings were published on April 10.\nOur ruling\nA social media post claimed that Italy found that COVID-19 is an easily treatable bacteria when it went against WHO\u2019s guidelines and performed an \"illegal\" autopsy.\u00a0\nCOVID-19\u2019s cause has been extensively studied and identified as a virus, and the WHO never discouraged autopsies of patients who died from COVID-19.
