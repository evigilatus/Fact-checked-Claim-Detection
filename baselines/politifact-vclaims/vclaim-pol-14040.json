The state Department of Public Instruction says the MPS board would have to determine if it is possible and the city attorney has not researched the question.\n\nWe\u2019ll leave it to students of finance to sort out if bankruptcy is the right approach to take. But we were struck by one of the claims Donovan made in stating his case. \u00a0\n\nArguing that MPS\u2019s pension and health benefits are \"unsustainable and overly generous,\" Donovan pointed to the district\u2019s 2010-2011 budget and said:\n\n\"MPS will provide 77 cents in employee benefits for every dollar it spends on wages.\"\n\nWait a minute. Don\u2019t most employers -- even public sector ones -- pay far less in benefits for every $1 in wages?\n\nLet\u2019s start with Donovan\u2019s specific claim, then take a look at his larger point -- that MPS benefits are excessive, taking limited money away from the classroom.\n\nIn making his claim, Donovan said the 77 cent figure came from the city\u2019s Legislative Reference Bureau, which is the research staff for the Common Council.\n\nIn turn, the reference bureau said it came from a March 2010 column written by education writer Alan Borsuk in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Borsuk said the figure came from an estimate MPS made that month, in developing the school district\u2019s 2010-2011 budget.\n\nBy the time Donovan made his statement in late September, however, the district had revised its estimate to a somewhat smaller number: 74 cents. That is where the figure remained after the School Board approved the budget in October 2010.\n\nSo, Donovan is generally on target.\n\nBut some additional clarification is in order. Donovan\u2019s statement suggests the pay-to-benefits ratio applies to the cost of current employees only.\n\nWhen MPS calculates its benefits in this fashion, it also includes the cost of providing benefits -- including pensions and health care -- to retirees. The district could not separate those costs for us, but that approach makes the figure higher.\n\nHow does the 74-cent figure compare?\n\nHere\u2019s what some other local governments estimate they will spend in 2011 on benefits -- for employees and retirees -- for every $1 spent on wages:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCity of Milwaukee: 48 cents (for general employees).\n\n\n\nRacine Unified School District: 57 cents\n\n\n\nMilwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District: 59 cents.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Milwaukee County -- struggling with the cost of enhanced pension benefits that led to officials being removed from office -- projects it will pay $1 in benefits for each dollar it pays in wages in 2011.\n\nAll right, the bell is about to ring, so we\u2019ll wrap up our lesson.\n\nIn calling on Milwaukee Public Schools to file for bankruptcy, Milwaukee Alderman Bob Donovan said that for every $1 MPS will spend in 2011 on wages, it will spend another 77 cents on benefits. The figure was off a bit, since he used an early estimate -- the actual number is 74 cents. And it\u2019s a little confusing for taxpayers, since it rolls in costs related to retirees, not just current employees. But his larger point -- that MPS pays a lot more in benefits than other local governments pay -- is on the money.\n\nWe rate Donovan\u2019s claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-14040"}
