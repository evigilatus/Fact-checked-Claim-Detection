Over 170,000 Wisconsin residents have a legal permit to carry a handgun. They are armed and prepared to defend themselves and others against acts of criminal violence. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. Illinois and Chicago, however, have been disarmed for your convenience.\"\nThe image was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

It also specifies\u00a0fines and other penalties for disregarding the law and\u00a0defacing existing highway signage.\nAs McHugh mentioned, Wisconsin isn\u2019t the only state to have its welcome sign digitally altered to include the fake gun warning.
