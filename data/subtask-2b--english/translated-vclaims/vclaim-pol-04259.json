Democracy called on Hillary Clinton to review from the top to the bottom in the criminal justice system to prevent unequal treatment of minorities by law. The Republican Donald Trump, clinging to his approach of \"law and order,\" painted a dark picture of life for African and Spanish Americans \"living in hell because it's too dangerous.\" He arrived in Chicago, the birthplace of President Barack Obama. \"In Chicago, they had thousands of shootings, thousands since January 1. Thousands of shootings, \"Trap said. Did Chicago have thousands of shootings so far this year? The Trump campaign showed us an article published in Forbes on September 8, saying about Chicago, \"In 2015, 2,988 people were shot and the figure in 2016 is now 2,949. Chicago Tribune, which traces neighborhood crime through the Chicago Land Crime Project, has data supporting this number of shootings in 2015. And as far as this year goes? From 1 January to 26 September, there were 3,210 shooting victims, according to the Chicago Tribune. According to the publication, the data it collects are not the same as the city, so the numbers will not match those of the city. \"One shooting may have many victims, but it is still officially considered only one shooting,\" says Chicago Tribune. Even then, data published by the Chicago Police Department also show 2,521 shooting incidents in the city until 18 September. The Mayor of Chicago, Ram Emmanuel, delivered a speech on 22 September in which he addressed the high levels of crime in his city and how to combat it, and outlined the need for more police work, more jobs and crime prevention. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" By Samantha Butterman (January 11, 2012): The violence of arms in Chicago is unacceptable. .................................................................................... It divides us at the moment our city needs us to get together.\" Emmanuel said, according to the Tribune. \"For all the things that make Chicago great, for all the things that make us proud to call ourselves Chicagoians, the violence that is happening erodes our milk. It's not the Chicago we know, it's not the Chicago we love.\" While the number of victims of the shooting has so far exceeded this year in 2015, it is important to note that they do not represent murders, we have been told by the experts. (The number of murders in Tribune, however, to date in 2016 is also higher than the number of murders in 2015 of 492). Adam Lanford, Professor of Criminology at the University of Alabama, said: \"The word \"fire\" does not discriminate on the basis of severity of the wound or the type of crime.\" The shooting statistics also include people who accidentally shot themselves. The shooting is simply a weapon that shoots and not someone who is shot or killed, said Dewey Cornell, director of the Virginia Youth Violence Project at the University of Virginia. The city figures are impressive, but Cornell said that violent crime in Chicago was much lower than it was 20 years ago, reflecting the national trend. When you have an explosion of guerrilla warfare in any society, there will be significant increases in gun killings, and Chicago has for over a century the problem of gangs that are much bigger than other cities like New York, said Cornell. \"There has been an increase in firearms violence in Chicago in recent years, but Chicago does not represent the United States and is unstereotypical from other large cities, so it is not logical to use Chicago as an example of understanding crime in the United States,\" Cornell. One reasonable explanation for the increase in shooting incidents in Chicago is that the gangs were displaced from their former area because of the demolition of some housing projects, as George A. Muksari, an assistant professor at the Law School of the University of South Illinois. \"The violence was triggered when displaced gang members tried to move to new land demanded by other gangs,\" said Muksiri. Our Governor Trump said, \"In Chicago, they've had thousands of shootings, thousands since January 1st. Thousands of shots fired.\" There are more than 3,000 victims of shooting in Chicago so far this year, according to media reports and experts in armed violence. The number of shooting incidents includes all types of shooting incidents, including the shooting of more than one person and in incidents, and should not be considered a substitute for \"murder.\" We evaluate the Trump statement correctly. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/836e5f63-9aca-4579-8e0a-4a3111bff73", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04259"}
