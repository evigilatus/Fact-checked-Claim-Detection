That's Pants on Fire", "text": "Are the tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump on China hurting American consumers? His team says no.\u00a0\nPeter Navarro, director of the White House\u2019s Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy, told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper that was not the case. Tapper asked about a study that found U.S. importers are shouldering about 95% of the price change from the tariffs, China only about 5%.\u00a0\nAfter Navarro pushed back, there was this exchange:\n\"Tariffs aren't hurting anybody in the United States?\" asked Tapper.\nNavarro responded, \"They're not hurting anybody here.\"\nThe White House didn\u2019t respond to our requests for information to support Navarro\u2019s statement.\nBut evidence to the contrary is overwhelming.\nExplaining the impact\nImporters can respond to tariffs in four ways, Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, told us.\u00a0\nTwo of the ways are paying their suppliers less and buying from producers in countries not subject to the tariffs; those moves would shield Americans.\nBut the other two ways \u2014 raising prices or absorbing the tariffs and cutting into their bottom line \u2014 do make an impact.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that, in the back-and-forth of the trade war, China has done a series of its own tariff reductions. That helps U.S. exporters.\nBut despite claims by Trump that China has been slashing prices, Brookings economist Gary Burtless and Boise State University political scientist Ross Burkhart said they see no evidence of price slashing as a result of the U.S. tariffs \u2014 at least on any scale as large as the impact of the tariffs.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the numbers\nEvidence of how tariffs have hurt Americans has been accumulating for months.\nPepsi, Coca-Cola, Costco and the recreational vehicle-maker Winnebago are among retailers that said they raised prices as a result of the tariffs.\u00a0\nThe trade war reduced U.S. real income by $1.4 billion per month by the end of 2018, according to economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Princeton University and Columbia University.\nThe price of washing machines sold in the United States rose nearly 12% because of the 2018 tariffs, according to University of Chicago researchers. (The price of dryers rose by a similar amount, even though they weren\u2019t subject to the tariffs.)\nMeanwhile, retaliatory tariffs imposed by China have particularly hurt U.S. farmers. U.S. agricultural exports to China dropped to $9.1 billion in 2018, down from $19.5 billion the previous year, according to the American Farm Bureau, an agricultural lobbying group. That figure has continued to drop, with exports to China in the first half of 2019 sinking to $1.3 billion. Trump has responded by boosting subsidies to farmers.\nTrump\u2019s plan to impose more tariffs on China in September 2019 will reduce consumer purchases, raise prices and limit hiring, according to four national retail groups.\u00a0\nBroad impact\nStudies have also consistently documented the general impact on Americans.\u00a0\nAbout 79% of manufacturers and 60% of service firms said tariffs had increased their input costs at least slightly, \"a considerably more widespread effect\" than in its survey a year earlier. That\u2019s according to a Federal Reserve Bank of New York August 2019 survey of business leaders in New York and parts of Connecticut and New Jersey.\u00a0\nThe impact of tariffs on imports of steel and Chinese goods that were imposed in 2018 was largely on the United States, not China, according to the study Tapper alluded to. It was done by researchers from Harvard University, the University of Chicago and the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.\nA variety of companies have reported harm from the U.S. and retaliatory tariffs, including Walmart, Caterpillar and Tyson Foods, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service found.\nOur ruling\nNavarro said U.S. tariffs on China are \"not hurting anybody\" in the United States.\nNumerous businesses, ranging from Coca-Cola, to Walmart to Costco to washing machine makers, raised prices because of the tariffs. And study after study has confirmed that the tariffs primarily hit Americans, not China. It\u2019s simply ridiculous to make a flat claim that the tariffs aren\u2019t hurting anyone in the United States.\nWe rate this statement Pants on Fire.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00251"}
