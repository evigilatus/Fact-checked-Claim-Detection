When Abele challenger Chris Larson was on the board, he voted to repair the dam, but now says he\u2019s willing to consider removing it because public sentiment seems to have changed.\nBut Larson, a state senator, also has been sharply critical of Abele\u2019s leadership on the issue. Both are Democrats running for the nonpartisan office in the April 5, 2016 election.\nAbele \"has had five years and he\u2019s done nothing\" about the dam, Larson said during a March 29, 2016 appearance before the Rotary Club of Milwaukee and the Milwaukee Press Club.\nThat echoed what he wrote in a March 15, 2016 email to supporters: \"The current county executive has provided no leadership in forging a consensus on what to do with the dam, he has no urgency in addressing this problem.\"\nIs Larson correct that Abele has \"done nothing\" on the matter?\nThe options\nThere are two major alternatives before county officials.\nRemoval: The Milwaukee Riverkeepers, a coalition of environmental groups, has urged the removal of the dam. They note that the removal of the North Avenue Dam, a few miles downstream, led to improved water quality and a thriving fish and wildlife population.\nAdvocates also argue the Estabrook Dam primarily benefits a small number of property owners who enjoy the impoundment, or lake, that the dam creates. They say that is unfair -- even illegal -- because a public facility is creating benefits for a few private property owners.\nRepair: The Milwaukee River Preservation Association, a group that includes riverfront property owners, and others, including County Board Chairman Theo Lipscomb, favor repairing the dam. They argue the dam creates an important water recreational area and say its removal could lead to the release of toxins built up behind the structure over the decades.\nUnder orders by the federal government, the county hired a consultant, AECOM, to conduct an environmental assessment of the dam. The $250,000 report, released in early 2015, did not recommend an option.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin LeMahieu\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a TV interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It takes quite a while on Election Day to load those ballots, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it did note public sentiment at meetings held in September 2014 was about 2-to-1 in favor of removal and said that over time it would cost twice as much to repair and continue operating the dam than it would be to remove it.\nThe report also cited the environmental benefits to allowing water to flow freely and called removal the most \"environmentally protective alternative.\"\nThe report was conducted during Abele\u2019s tenure, under orders from the federal government, because it was believed, at the time, that the feds owned an island that is connected to the dam.\nAbele\u2019s tenure\nThere\u2019s considerable disagreement between Abele and some members of the County Board -- especially Lipscomb, who represents the area -- over how to address the dam.\nIf you had to describe Abele\u2019s record on the dam in one word, it would be \"hamstrung.\"\nOn at least two occasions involving the 2015 budget, Lipscomb succeed in getting the board to insert money into the county budget -- first to repair the dam and later to build a fish passage, which is a component of one of the rebuilding options. Abele vetoed both, with one overridden and one sustained.\nIn between the votes and vetoes, Abele\u2019s parks department sent a memo to the board urging it to take action and noting the board itself had changed its position from remove to replace several times.\nAbele also sent the board a resolution to remove the dam, noting that repairs had become increasingly expensive. And Abele\u2019s chief of staff, Raisa Koltun, followed up with several emails to Lipscomb, but the matter was never scheduled for a vote.\nBeyond the stalemate with the County Board, Koltun said Abele has worked to forge a consensus with local units of government that have an interest in the dam, including the city of Milwaukee, villages of Shorewood and Brown Deer and the Metropolitan Milwaukee Sewerage District.\nHe has also worked with groups like the Sierra Club, Trout Unlimited and the Milwaukee Riverkeeper, as well as pursued private and federal funding to help pay for the dam\u2019s removal.\nOur rating\nLarson says Abele has had five years in office and \"done nothing\" about the Estabrook Dam, with an earlier statement blaming him for a lack of consensus.\nBut records and news accounts show Abele has been consistent in wanting the dam removed, has taken steps to make his wishes known and to build support for removal among nearby communities and other groups. Along the way, he has been thwarted by the County Board.\nLarson\u2019s statement was that Abele has done nothing. That rates False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05175"}
