You might reconsider.", "text": "Even political addicts can be forgiven for not being too interested in elections in the province of the Tenth Congress of Georgia. The Pondites expect the massive Republican people from the crabs and rural lands of the north-eastern corner of Georgia to select GOP Judy Hess candidate for Democratic Advocate Ken Dios next November. A former minister and host of a radio talk show, Hess has generated a lot of interest from his governor in various subjects such as religion (Islam is not a religion but \"political structure, and thus does not deserve the protection of the First Amendment\") and qualifications to run for political office (if the woman is in the power of her husband, I see no problem). However, it is certain that no one has been able to turn to Hess's decision to show what he calls his constitutional portfolio by quoting Thomas Jefferson's political figure on Facebook and Twitter. \"This government is the best to govern less, because its people discipline themselves,\" reads the quote attributed to Jefferson, in the image of the American flagboard. One of the readers asked Polyte Fact Georgia to check the quote. So we did. To quote the Internet, \"Merica! To quote Anna Perks, the Research Librarian at Thomas Jefferson Foundation in Montesilo, Virginia, \"This seems like something he may have said or written, but in fact, he didn't.\" It turns out that our third president, the main author of the Declaration of Independence, who left this secular plane 188 years ago, is still a powerful \"writer\" on the Internet. He has also dealt with various topics such as religion (\"The Bible is the source of freedom,\" a false quotation) and qualifications for political office (\"No man will ever remove his reputation in that office,\" a verified quotation). He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. By Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2012, the abuse of distribution around the Internet became so bad that Perks, a few years ago, created the page of fair quotations on the Montesillo web site. The fake that Hess published was a common mistake that was wrongly attributed to Jefferson in 1853. Historians have long attributed this quote to Henry David Thoreau, who used a different version of it in his 1849 article, \"Civil rebellion,\" to argue that individuals should not allow governments to make them agents of injustice. However, new research suggests that Thoreau himself was probably quoting from The United States Magazine and Democratic Review, where feelings first appeared in 1837, said Perks. \"The opinion was linked to the ideology of the Republican Democratic Party of Jefferson, and that's probably why people think he said that,\" said Perks. \"The bond is the so-called Jeffersonian natural principle. It's not just Jefferson's quote.\" Hess did not respond to the requests for comments. As Perks suggests, questionable quotations may still be useful for a long-term ideological transfer, regardless of source. Or, as Eller Robert Coates concludes, the researcher at the Jefferson Library, may refute the misunderstanding of Jefferson's views. Coates argues that the quote does not represent Jefferson because of his mysterious use of \"better\" and \"less.\" One thing that's clear is that there's no verifiable evidence that Thomas Jefferson said or wrote this feeling. The correction of the record would certainly be equivalent to Jefferson, who once said, \"If we are to be wary of ignorance and to remain free, it is the responsibility of every American to be aware.\" Well, he didn't say that either. Because of Berex' carefully deleted research, we can assess our claim and that of Hess as false.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07356"}
