Pines recycled a GOP faulty talk point that the foundation is a cash cow to enrich the Clintons and their friends. \"Ten cents on the dollar from the Clinton Foundation goes to charity issues,\" said Penny. This is based on a misunderstanding of how the enterprise works. In short, it raises funds to provide the services and projects themselves. The amount of funds it provides as grants is a small part of its activities. We will use the most recent Clinton Corporation tax form, 2014, as an example. (to begin on page 28 of this document.) The Foundation reported a total expenditure in 2014 of just over $91 million, but grants were only $5.1 million. This means that about 6 percent of the institution &apos; s money is spent on grants. But that doesn't mean that everything else is unusual, says people who watch charities and their practices, or that only 10 cents of every dollar went to charity. \"Though the Clinton Foundation has \"the Foundation\" in its name, it is in fact a public charity,\" wrote Brian Metendorf, Professor of Accounting at Fisher Business College, Ohio State University, in the Code of Charitable Facts. \"In practice, this means that they rely heavily on donations from the public and that they essentially fulfil their mission by using those contributions to carry out direct charitable activities, rather than providing grants from a gift.\" What are some of the Foundation's programs? The Clinton Development Initiative helps farmers in Malawi, Rwanda and Tanzania to increase crops and obtain higher market prices. The Clinton Geostra Project Partnership launched the Training Centre for Career Training for Persons in Cartagena, Colombia. For example, the Clinton Access to Health Initiative has secured credit to provide access to cheaper medicines for millions of people living with HIV/AIDS. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 On January 11, 2021, the financial databases required a non-profit person to apportion its expenses between programme services, fund-raising and administrative/public costs (the latter combined with what is referred to as \"public expenditure\"), told us about Mittendorf. In 2014, 87.2 per cent of the Clinton Foundation &apos; s expenditure had been on programme services. \"Of course, this speaks only of how the Organization uses its funds and not of whether 87.2 per cent has been allocated to the most effective programme efforts, but that is all we have in terms of verifiable data on this issue,\" said Mentendorf. The American Institute of Charities reached the same conclusion. The Clinton Foundation has given an excellent degree and says that it spends only 12% of the money it collects on \"the capital.\" \"The Clinton Foundation is an excellent charity,\" on August 24, 2016, the president of CNN, Daniel Burutschoff, said. \"They are able to obtain 88 per cent of their spending on programme services in good faith and their fund-raising efficiency is indeed low. It only costs them two dollars to raise $100.\" Other Republican critics of the Foundation used slightly higher numbers than Pines. The president of the Republican National Committee, Raines Bribos, said that the foundation spent only 20% on good business. The conservative broadcaster Rush Limbo said it was 15%. That's inaccurate, too. Our judgment said Penny 10 cents on every dollar from the Clinton Foundation goes to charity cases. While the Foundation grants a small portion of its resources, about 87 per cent of its expenditures go to the services it directly provides. A prominent financial expert for charities, Mittendorf, says that while Clinton itself advocates an institution, it acts as a public charity. She cautioned that while dollar amounts were clear and verified, this did not ensure that programmes were effective and efficient. However, this is not the criticism raised by Benes. We value this allegation wrong. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/bf107795-1430-4e2d-be85-14f85d34477a", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04210"}
