But that doesn't really matter, especially since many candidates in the democratic sphere are in the Senate or the House of Representatives. In both cases, Giuliani is right that Democrats are open to letting some of the 2001 tax cuts end, which would raise taxes on those affected. Most candidates for the Democratic Presidency said that they wanted to renew some of those tax cuts, which were due to end in 2010. However, they also indicated that they would prefer to allow tax cuts to end, which in their view would unfairly benefit rich Americans. The tax rate on household income in excess of $200,000 will return to higher levels, as will taxes on capital gains, profits and property. But is that a 20% to 30% increase? On January 13, 2021, bloggers announced the extraordinary truth-checking story in which General David H. Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request to use marines to provide security for the inauguration, saying, \"We're not working for you.\" By Samantha Butterman (January 17, 2021) to defend his claim, Juliani's campaign refers to a report by the Congressional Budget Office showing a 31% increase in revenue from 2006 to 2011 if all tax cuts are allowed to end. There are two problems with this. First of all, Democrats do not advocate the elimination of all tax cuts for 2001. Second, Juliani's reasoning is that the increase in revenue is the same as the increase in tax. If this is the standard, more than President Bush &apos; s 2008 budget, released in February, it includes a 29 percent tax increase over the same period, too. No, that's not enough.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00338"}
