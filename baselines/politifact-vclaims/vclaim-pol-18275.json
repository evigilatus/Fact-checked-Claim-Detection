Much of the country has reopened, with children returning to school May 4.\nWhile Vietnam has grappled with real issues related to animal welfare, experts we spoke to say they haven\u2019t found widespread evidence that black cats are being killed and turned into a paste to treat COVID-19.\nThe news service that generated the story said it has removed the article from circulation amid concerns about its credibility.\nHere\u2019s what we know.\nOn April 17, The Sun, a tabloid in the United Kingdom and Ireland, published a story that reported on an investigation by an animal rights group called Four Paws. According to the story, the group said it examined dining app data and found that dog and cat meat sales were surging through dining app delivery services in Cambodia and Vietnam. The story surmised that \"doctors in the region are encouraging many to eat dog and cat meat, claiming its properties help fight off viruses.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Bloggers\n\n\nstated on January 25, 2021 in a blog post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWHO now saying you do not need to wear a mask.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA week later, on April 23 and 24, stories credited to the South West News Service were published elsewhere that had a similar storyline, but took the claim further to suggest black cats are being singled out, turned into paste and consumed as medicine.\u00a0\nPictures credited to South West News Service accompanied some versions of the online stories. But the captions were vague and the images hard to verify. They included, for example, a photo of a baby drinking from a bottle that appears to contain a black substance. \"This distressing image shows a baby reportedly being fed the black cat concoction,\" the caption said.\nThe stories\u2019 only source appeared to be the head of another charity, No to Dog Meat, based in London. We reached out to that group for evidence. They sent us to their YouTube account which includes four videos uploaded in April and May that claim in captions or titles to show cat mistreatment in Vietnam but which included no verifiable information about exactly where or when they were taken.\nAsked about the black cat claim, Cat Besch, founder and director of Hanoi-based Vietnam Animal Aid & Rescue, told PolitiFact she has seen \"zero evidence in Vietnam so far that this is true.\"\nNam Nguyen, an editor in Vietnam with the government-run Vietnam News Agency, told PolitiFact \"the rumor has been around these weeks and originated from one post in Thailand social media, but as far as I know, Vietnamese are not so superstitious like other nations in southeast Asia to practice those ancient rites.\" He said the post has been deleted.\nPhuong Tham, director of Human Society International in Vietnam, told PolitiFact that black cats are being killed there \"by people with lack of knowledge, believing that black cats' bones can treat asthma in children, while others kill them for superstitious beliefs,\" but \"we have seen no evidence that black cats in Vietnam are being killed for COVID-19 treatment.\"\nTham and Dr. Todd Pollack, Harvard University medical professor and country director in Hanoi of the Partnership for Health Advancement in Vietnam, said it is significant that they had not seen the claim reported by news organizations in Vietnam.\nVN Express, a newspaper in Vietnam, reported that on May 6, police in Nghe An province seized 630 kilograms of dog, cat carcasses and entrails of other animals from a passenger bus. The driver said the meat was being taken to Hanoi for consumption, according to the report. But the report contains no suggestion the meat was being used for treatment of coronavirus.\nWhen we reached out to South West News Service about the source of the information, the agency told PolitiFact that \"shortly after publication, we identified a number of issues with this story and pulled it from our service. We received new information which led us to doubt the widespread nature of the claims the charity had made on this issue.\"\nWe rate this claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18275"}
