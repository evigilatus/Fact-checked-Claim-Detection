The shooting sparked a national debate about the relationship between law enforcement and African-Americans and the use of deadly force.\nFerguson is in the social media spotlight nearly five years later, as people connected to the protests have been found dead.\u00a0\nOne Facebook post, shared more than 3,500 times, cries foul play, saying that the deaths of \"six of the most prominent activists\" was no coincidence as they were all found \"burned to death in their cars,\" implying that they were victims of a larger conspiracy theory.\u00a0\nThe full post reads:\u00a0\n\"I need people to wake up and realise that SIX of the most prominent activists during the Ferguson riots have all been found burned to death in their cars. There are no coincidences here. It\u2019s systemic.\"\u00a0\nThe July 15 post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nHere\u2019s what we found: Some people involved in the Ferguson protests, or connected to people who were, have died since 2014. But they were not all found burned to death in their cars as the post claims. The other cases were ruled as suicides, an accidental drowning and a fentanyl overdose.\nLet\u2019s break this down.\nDeAndre Joshua\nOn Nov. 24, 2014, the morning after a grand jury declined to indict Wilson, 20-year-old DeAndre Joshua was found dead, reportedly inside a burned car after being shot in the head.\nThe timing, as well as Joshua reportedly being close friends with Dorian Johnson, who was with Michael Brown on the day of the shooting, led many to speculate if the events were connected. But Joshua\u2019s family dispelled rumors that he was a \"key witness\" in Brown\u2019s case, saying in a New York Times article \"he had known nothing about Mr. Brown\u2019s death and never testified before the grand jury.\"\nShawn Gray\nShawn Gray, a 23-year-old who went missing the same week Joshua died, was later found drowned in the River Des Peres. The city\u2019s medical examiner later ruled that the cause of death was an accidental drowning, with alcohol poisoning as a major contributing factor, the St. Louis Post Dispatch reported. There were unproven rumors that Gray, like Joshua, was killed after testifying in front of a grand jury in the Brown case. But Gray\u2019s family also dismissed those rumors, saying he had no connection to the case.\u00a0\nNeither Joshua nor Gray were \"prominent activists.\" It\u2019s important to note that even if both men had testified, their deaths came after the grand jury chose not to indict Wilson.\nDarren Seals\nIn September 2016, 29-year-old Darren Seals suffered a similar death to Joshua: his body was found inside a burning car after having been shot. Seals was a prominent figure in the protests and is seen in a video comforting Brown\u2019s mother after the grand jury\u2019s decision.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the time of Seals\u2019 death, St. Louis County police acknowledged the similarities of the tragedies and told outlets \"anything\u2019s a possibility\" and that detectives are \"always going to look into different avenues, or if it\u2019s the same kind of motive.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nSgt. Benjamin Granda, a St. Louis County Police Department spokesman, confirmed to PolitiFact that the agency investigated both homicides.\n\"There is no information that exists that would indicate they are related in any way,\" Granda wrote in an email. \"Gunshot wounds were identified as the cause of death of both victims. Both investigations remain ongoing. We always remind people to please contact the St. Louis County Police Department at (636)529-8210 to speak to investigators regarding the incident.\"\u00a0\nOf the three remaining deaths, two have been ruled as suicides and one an overdose.\nIf you or someone you know needs emotional support, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is available 24 hours a day at 1-800-273-8255\nEdward Crawford Jr.\u00a0\nEdward Crawford Jr., 27, was featured in a famous photograph from Ferguson throwing a gas canister back at police. Police determined that he died by suicide in May 2017.\nDanye Jones\nIn October 2018, 24-year-old Danye Jones was found dead in the yard of his St. Louis home. It was ruled a suicide. Jones\u2019 mother, Melissa McKinnies, who was an active Ferguson demonstrator, said in a TV interview she thought it was foul play.\nBassem Masri\nThe latest death happened in November 2018 when Bassem Masri, a 31-year-old Palestinian-American who livestreamed videos of the Ferguson protests, was found unresponsive on a bus. Toxicology results showed he died of a fentanyl overdose.\nA seventh man who died in February 2016 has sometimes been included in this theory. Ferguson protestor and Black Lives Matter activist MarShawn McCarrell II, 23, of Columbus, Ohio, reportedly died by suicide involving a gun outside of the Ohio statehouse.\nA news investigation\u2019s findings\n\"This American Life,\" a weekly public radio program produced in collaboration with Chicago Public Media, aired a segment on the conspiracy theory in March 2019. Writer Jelani Cobb traveled to Ferguson to speak with the community and found people pondered \"all kinds of possible culprits \u2026 from white supremicists to local and federal law enforcement, to armed militia members\" to explain the deaths.\nCobb went over some ways in which the theory doesn\u2019t quite hold up: \"St. Louis proper has one of the most alarming homicide rates in the country. In 2017, it was the most alarming, having the highest murder rate, according to an analysis of FBI data. By comparison, Chicago was No. 9. So, lots of people get shot in St. Louis.\"\nOur ruling\nA viral Facebook post says six \"of the most prominent activists during the Ferguson riots have all been found burned to death in their cars. There are no coincidences here. It\u2019s systemic.\"\u00a0\nMultiple people directly and indirectly connected to the Ferguson protests have died in the nearly five years since Brown\u2019s death, but not all were involved in the Brown case, as unproven rumors claimed. They were also not all discovered \"burned to death in their cars.\" Suicide, accidental drowning and drug overdose were also listed as official causes of death.\nThis claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00401"}
