It's not surprising that the Democrat-controlled house is opposed to Trump's plan to build a wall, but is Castro right? Does Texas also oppose a wall? The opinion polls show the division of Texans over the wall by the spokesman for Castro Jimmy Geller that Congressman &apos; s claim is based on a poll published by the University of Koenibiak in April 2018, according to which 53 per cent of respondents surveyed opposed the construction of a wall, with an error margin of 3.6 percentage points plus or minus. We have decided to step back and consider the polls issued on this subject since 2016 by three non-partisan entities that conducted surveys in Texas to assess the validity of Castro &apos; s claim: the polls at the University of Texas/Texas Tribune, the polls in Texas Lasim and the polls at the University of Quebec. Four polls showed that the number of respondents opposed to the wall was higher than the number of supporters, with one survey showing the opposite. A sixth survey was issued on Tuesday, after Castro filed his claim against Texans who opposed the wall, revealing an equal division. Only two opinion polls showed a clear majority in opposition to the wall. A poll at the University of Texas/Texas Tribune of registered voters in Texas published in June 2016 showed that 52 per cent of respondents either strongly supported or to some extent supported a wall along the United States-Mexico border. The same survey, which had a margin of error plus or minus 2.83 percentage points, found 40 per cent of respondents either strongly opposed or somewhat opposed a boundary wall. Of those consulted, 8 per cent said that they did not know or have no opinion on the wall. Two years later, in February 2018, an opinion poll conducted by the University of Texas/Texas Tribune showed that 50 per cent of respondents said they were either strongly opposed to or to some extent opposed to a border wall, and that 45 per cent supported a wall strongly or to some extent. Two surveys from Texas Lesim, a non-profit organization, showed a majority against the wall. These polls did not limit the group of respondents to potential or registered voters, but conducted an adult survey in Texas. An opinion poll conducted in September 2016 from the group showed that 59 per cent of the adult respondents opposed the proposed border wall of Trump, with 35 per cent supporting the wall. The survey had a margin of error plus or minus 3.1 percentage points. In April 2017, the LISA survey, which had a margin of error plus or minus 3.1 percentage points, reported 61 per cent of respondents opposing the wall and 35 per cent expressing support. In his interview on January 31, 2021, John Kerry says that Hurricane Harvey \"dropped more water in Houston in five days than in Niagara Falls in one year.\" There were 1,029 voters voting, and the 3.6 percentage point margin of error raised the possibility that less than 50 per cent of Texas voters would actually oppose the wall. :: Geller, Castro spokesman, referred to the April 2018 poll as the evidence behind the Democratic Party &apos; s claim. On Tuesday, the University of Quebec released a new poll showing that the voters in Texas are divided equally on whether they support the border wall. Of the 1,222 voters surveyed, 48 per cent said that they supported the wall and 48 per cent said that they opposed it. The survey had a margin of error plus or minus 3.4 percentage points. Peter Brown, Assistant Director of Paul of Queeniepiak University, said that the results showed that Castro's claim was not quite true, at least Tuesday afternoon. He said, \"It's actually wrong.\" \"It's 48-48.\" But does Texas voters support the way Trump seeks to build the wall? The same Paul of the University of Koenipek showed that 60 per cent of respondents said that they did not agree with Trump's move to use emergency forces to secure funding for the construction of a wall. Our reign, Castro, said, \"Most people in my state in Texas disagree with the president in building a wall across our borders.\" Surveys from the University of Texas/Texas Tribune, Texas Lissium and the University of Koenipek showed that voters and adults in Texas are largely divided over their support for the wall. Only two opinion polls showed a clear majority in opposition to the wall - those conducted by Texas Laiseum in 2016 and 2017. In these two ballots, the study interviewed adults in Texas and was not limited to potential or registered voters, contrary to opinion polls at the University of Texas/Texas Tribune and the University of Queenbike. Castro &apos; s comment was not limited to registered or weighted voters, so we took this into account in determining the judgement. We classify this claim as half true. Recent polls show that more people are opposed to a border wall than they support it, but only two of the six polls we considered showed a clear majority. The truth is now - the statement is partially accurate, but it ignores important details or leaves things out of context.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00968"}
