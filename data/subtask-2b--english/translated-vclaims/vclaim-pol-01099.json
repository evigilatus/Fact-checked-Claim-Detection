But some social media users share fake images that drive the narrative away from course. Adolescents from the school of all the boys in Kentucky were attending the march of life in Washington, D.C., when they were photographed on video by Jan 18 dressed as \"making America great again the hats\" as they surrounded Nathan Phillips. The meeting with publications led to the publication of videos with headlines such as \"Kentucky teenagers wearing Maga hats mocking indigenous participants in March.\" The videos later showed that the meeting took place after black demonstrators yelled at the students. On the same day, an alleged Twitter sketch of one of the children's mothers appeared on the Internet. The account appears to belong to Julie Sandman. The curriculum vitae says: \"The proud mother of Nick Sandman of Covington Catholic. He is not here to apologize or grovel. # Faith\" picture of Nick Sandman -- the guy who showed the viral video staring right at Phillips while Phillips drumped and sang the song of the Indian-American movement -- prevents the number of tweets sent by the account, but two appear in the picture. \"After what I've been through in the last 36 hours, I just wish the pioneers had brought more blankets with smallpox.\" The other one: \"This guy's been proven to be Lear! \"Never trust the Indians.\" Maybe there's a reason people say that you've thought about it before?

The account no longer exists, but if you look for the account handle, @Gauchoguacamoole, Google's first result shows that it belongs to someone other than Julie Sandman. Instead, the account is attributed to \"Dad Football.\" The curriculum vitae says: \"The proud father of the U12 football player at the Youth Football Conference in South New Hampshire.\" Google continues to run clippings from some of the previous account tweetes, such as \"I hope that Pines goes to prison...\" in November 11, 2018, and \"All that Donald Trump touches dies.\" One Twitter user was caught before @gauchugamamole disappeared from the podium. \"Everybody posts a tweet by Julie Sandman, but look at the Twitter handle,\" the guy tweeted. @gauchuguacamoule is only trying to add fuel to the fire.\" This allegation is false.
