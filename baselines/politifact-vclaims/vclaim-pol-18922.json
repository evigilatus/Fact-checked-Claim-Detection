As we drilled down, we found that the numbers behind Biden\u2019s statement are reasonably correct, but the underlying government data aren\u2019t robust enough for firm conclusions.\nThe report behind Biden\u2019s words\nThe Biden campaign relied on a report from the labor-backed project Good Jobs Nation, which is part of a group called Change to Win. The report looked at companies that won government contracts between the time Trump won the election and the first week of June 2018. The first thing to note is the period included about three months before Trump took office, which isn\u2019t what Biden said.\nThe report then looked at companies with workers who were at risk of losing their jobs because the company planned to move work overseas.\nThat second list comes from the federal Trade Adjustment Assistance program, an effort that\u2019s been around for about six decades to help workers displaced by foreign trade. When someone loses their job, they can apply for retraining and financial assistance to move into a new job.\nThe Good Jobs Nation report took the top 100 government contractors \u2014 which included companies such as Boeing, General Motors, Siemens and United Technologies \u2014 and counted up the number of jobs that appeared under their names in the Trade Adjustment Assistance program. The study included jobs at risk due to production shifting overseas.\nThe report found that collectively, these firms accounted for 8,363 lost jobs per year. In contrast, the average rate was 3,100 during the Obama administration. The Trump rate is about two and a half times higher, so that\u2019s the basis for Biden\u2019s statement.\nTo be clear, the report had a narrow focus. The report\u2019s author, George Faraday, a lawyer and policy analyst with Change to Win, said it was written in response to Trump\u2019s signature effort in 2016, before he took office,\u00a0to stop the air conditioning company Carrier Corp. from sending jobs to Mexico. (We rated that a Promise Kept.)\u00a0\n\"Our point was that Carrier was a one-off and there was no serious follow up,\" said Faraday. \"The administration was willing to award these companies contracts worth billions of dollars from taxpayers, with no expectation that they would invest in the country.\"\nFaraday said he never updated the study beyond the June 2018 cutoff point.\nChecking the underlying numbers\nIt\u2019s important to understand what the trade adjustment job numbers mean, and where the report\u2019s numbers aren\u2019t as precise as they appear. For example, it says Boeing Co. was awarded over $29 billion in contracts, and had 2,681 jobs show up in the Trade Adjustment Assistance program. In fact, the government ultimately found that over 5,275 jobs were threatened.\u00a0\nWe found a few instances where the Good Jobs Nation report overshot the government figures by a few hundred jobs. On balance, the numbers we found indicated that the thrust of the report\u2019s findings holds up, even if the numbers are off at certain points.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the government numbers don\u2019t necessarily count people who lost their jobs. The estimates include actual separations, people whom the company thinks it might need to lay off and workers who might see their hours and wages cut back. And it also counts contract workers, which in Boeing\u2019s case involves a large number of firms that provide Boeing with workers who have special skills.\nA question of timing\nEven if the numbers in the report check out, it\u2019s reasonable to scrutinize the findings a little more.\nWe looked at whether total U.S. employment at some of the largest firms rose or fell during the period the report covers. We were able to get hard numbers only from Boeing. Between 2016 and 2017, the company shed about 9,000 jobs.\nThe comparison isn\u2019t perfect. The figure doesn\u2019t include contract workers, and the time period doesn\u2019t align perfectly with the 18 months in the Good Jobs Nation study. But the decline suggests the report spotted a real trend.\nOn the other hand, what happened at Boeing in 2018 and 2019 points to the biggest limitation in Biden\u2019s claim \u2014 it considers a narrow time frame.\nThe Boeing press office told us that the number of workers rose over the next two years, and by 2019, the total was 5,000 higher than in 2016.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that Biden spoke only about federal contractors and jobs sent out of the country. Looking at all companies and jobs affected by trade \u2014 which includes jobs lost when production shifts to outside U.S. borders, but also when imports displace domestic production \u2014 the average number of displaced workers is lower during the Trump years than during Obama\u2019s second term. The difference is about 4,000 jobs, or a decline of about 5%.\nReshoring jobs: Beware of simple talking points\nThe flip side of offshoring is reshoring, or bringing overseas jobs back to the U.S. The data on that is limited.\nThe Reshoring Initiative, a project of a private business consultant Harry Moser, tracks press releases and news reports to count jobs brought back to the U.S. That\u2019s a bit informal, but in any case, Moser said Trump\u2019s record is mixed, largely due to his policy of imposing tariffs.\n\"Reshoring grew solidly thru 2015, soared in 2016 when Trump was elected, accelerated higher in 2017 with lower taxes and regulations, then declined in 2018 and 2019, primarily due to business uncertainty from the trade war,\" Moser said.\nBut the bottom line is that\u00a0claims about both sending jobs overseas and bringing them home should not be taken at face value.\nOur ruling\nBiden said that in his first 18 months in office, Trump allowed government contractors to offshore jobs at twice the rate as before.\nBiden accurately quoted a report, and its findings are reasonably accurate. But the report\u2019s job count actually began before Trump took office, and the government\u2019s tallies include jobs that are at risk, not necessarily ones that are lost. That way of counting jobs, however, would apply equally to the Trump and Obama years.\nThere\u2019s a measure of accuracy in Biden\u2019s statement, but it requires more context.\nWe rate this claim Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18922"}
