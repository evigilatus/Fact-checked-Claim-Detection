Just how popular is college basketball in North Carolina?\nSome alumni of UNC, Duke, Wake Forest and N.C. State may be surprised to learn that not all North Carolinians are crazy for college hoops.\nAccording to a poll taken just before last season by Public Policy Polling, 52 percent of North Carolinians consider themselves college basketball fans.\nIn another PPP poll commissioned in early July by MomsRising and other groups that mostly focused on paid leave \u2013 the same poll their Twitter claim referenced \u2013 college basketball received 53 percent support.\nYet even just two years prior, in 2013, 59 percent of North Carolina respondents told PPP they were college basketball fans.\nOther polls have documented the sport\u2019s declining popularity nationwide. Gallup, for instance, found that while the number of fans didn\u2019t drop between 2001 and 2012, the number of people saying they were definitely not fans (as opposed to on the fence) has grown.\nAnd according to the Harris Poll, college basketball was perhaps at its height in 1989, when 10 percent of Americans said it was their favorite sport. In 2015, that number was 4 percent.\nTime Magazine analyzed the sport\u2019s declining popularity last year and attributed it to a number of factors, including low scoring, conference realignment that ended some popular rivalries, and a schedule that forces it to compete for attention with both college and professional football.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Boysko\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in a committee debate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe United States is the only industrialized, modernized country that does not already have a paid family medical leave program in place.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport for paid leave\nLet\u2019s now take a break to watch some of our favorite college basketball moments, then get back to the subject at hand: paid leave policies.\nAccording to one United Nations study of 170 countries, only the U.S. and the tiny Pacific island nation of Papua New Guinea don\u2019t require paid family leave.\nPolitiFact has previously checked several people claiming the U.S. is lagging behind the rest of the world in its paid leave policies; it was particularly popular with Bernie Sanders during his run for the Democratic presidential nomination.\nIt could be expensive. PolitiFact\u2019s \"Obameter,\" which tracks promises made by the president, noted that he has failed in his promise to spend $1.5 billion to start paid family and medical leave in the United States.\nIn North Carolina, the poll from Public Policy Polling that MomsRising commissioned found 49 percent of people strongly favor paid family leave\u00a0and another 19 percent somewhat favor it, for a total of 68 percent support. To jog your memory, college basketball has recently been polling about 15 percentage points lower than that.\nWe don\u2019t know the partisan breakdown of this poll, but in national polls, paid leave typically has bipartisan support \u2013 although moreso among liberals \u2013 and among politicians, it\u2019s far more popular among Democrats than Republicans.\nBecause of that, it\u2019s worth noting that the poll in question was paid for by a\u00a0liberal group\u00a0pushing for more paid leave policies, and that Public Policy Polling is itself a liberal-leaning organization.\nSo take these numbers with a grain of salt.\nBut unfortunately, there has been little to no other statewide polling on the topic.\nPublic Policy Polling \u2013 which does polls for private clients as well as for public distribution \u2013 has never before asked about paid family leave in a public poll.\u00a0Similarly, we weren\u2019t able to find any other statewide polling on the subject (although if you know of any, please let us know).\nBut nationally, the polling does mirror what PPP found in North Carolina.\nIn 2015, an AP-GfK poll found two-thirds of Americans supported paid family leave \u2013 about the same as the recent North Carolina poll, but lacking the political biases, and an AP-NORC poll two months ago\u00a0found 75 percent support among people age 40 and older.\u00a0A\u00a0New York Times-CBS poll, in 2015, found 80 percent support for paid family leave nationally.\nOur ruling\nMomsRising said that \"paid family leave is more popular than college basketball\" in North Carolina.\nThere is little polling on this topic at the state level, but what there is does line up with national polling.\nSince data is sparse but does support the claim,\u00a0we rate it\u00a0Mostly True.\n\u00a0\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/0963b149-97d8-405c-b3e4-2bc010444fab", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04689"}
