That means 150 million Americans, half of us.\"", "truth_label": "half-true", "date": "stated on April 22, 2012 in an interview on CBS' \"Face the Nation\":", "title": "Tavis Smiley says \"one out of two Americans \u2026 are living either in or near poverty\"", "text": "On the April 22, 2012, edition of CBS\u2019 Face the Nation, PBS talk show host Tavis Smiley appeared alongside Cornel West, a professor at Princeton University and Union Theological Seminary, to discuss the book they co-wrote, The Rich And The Rest Of Us: A Poverty Manifesto.\n\nHost Bob Schieffer kicked off the conversation about poverty in America by asking, \"How bad is it, Tavis?\"\n\nSmiley responded, \"It's horrible when one out of two Americans, Bob, are living either in or near poverty. That means 150 million Americans, half of us, are wrestling with this issue.\"\n\nA reader asked us if this was accurate, so we took a look.\n\nWe first turned to the official poverty statistics, which are collected by the Census Bureau. According to the most recent figures -- for 2010 -- 15.1 percent of Americans, or about 46 million people, are officially in poverty. That\u2019s far below both the percentage and the raw number Smiley offered on television.\n\nHowever, Smiley did say \"in or near poverty,\" so we checked that, too. The Census Bureau found that 104 million people are living at at twice the poverty level, or 33.9 percent of the population. That\u2019s still short of the levels Smiley cited.\n\nIn fact, the national median household income for 2010 was $49,445. By comparison, a non-elderly household with two adults and one child would be at the poverty level if it had income of $15,030. To be \"in or near poverty\" according to Smiley's formulation would mean being about 3.3 times the official poverty level.\n\nCalling those who are up to 300 percent of the poverty level near-poor \"is a stretch,\" said Andrew G. Biggs, a resident scholar the conservative American Enterprise Institute.\n\nMichael Wiseman, a George Washington University economist, agreed, saying that \"\u2018near poverty\" is generally interpreted as having an income less than twice the poverty standard. \u2026 I know of no country in which all persons with incomes less than the median are considered poor or near-poor. Would this mean that all persons with incomes above the median should be considered rich or near-rich?\"\n\nThere is one Census Bureau measure that supports Smiley\u2019s claim -- an unofficial one.\n\nCurrently, poverty is measured by establishing a set of multiple income thresholds for families of different sizes and compositions, then comparing family incomes to those levels. Being in poverty means that you that have an income below the threshold for your family type. But for years, scholars have debated whether there is a better way to measure poverty than the official statistic. One of the efforts to test an alternative measurement is called the Supplemental Poverty Measure, or SPM.\n\nThe SPM doesn\u2019t just consider cash earned but also in-kind transfers such as food stamps, net taxes paid, and medical and work-related expenses, such as child care and commuting costs, wrote University of Massachusetts-Amherst economist Nancy Folbre in a New York Times blog post. It also employs a \"new standard of need, linked to what low-income families actually spend,\" she wrote.\n\nIn 2010, a federal interagency working group gave a green light to calculating the statistic, but only as long as the long-standing poverty calculation retained its official status. The SPM \"will be an additional macroeconomic statistic providing further understanding of economic conditions and trends,\" the Census Bureau wrote.\n\nIn November 2011, the Census Bureau released an official report with SPM data for 2010. The poverty rate reported by the SPM was only a percentage point higher than the official rate, though different sub-groups fared differently. (Because of how the SPM is calculated, it showed lower poverty rates among children and higher rates among senior citizens.)\n\nThe important point for Smiley\u2019s claim is that the SPM report found that just under 48 percent of the population had incomes at twice the poverty level or below -- a number in tune with Smiley\u2019s claim that \"one out of two Americans \u2026 are living either in or near poverty.\"\n\nWhen we reached Smiley, he said that his claim on Face the Nation stemmed from the very first footnote of his and West\u2019s book -- a CBS News report headlined \"Census data: Half of U.S. poor or low income.\" A look at the CBS report confirmed that the number being cited was from the SPM, not the traditional poverty measure.\n\nSo Smiley has support for his number from Census Bureau statistics. However, in the context of a fast-paced television interview, some nuance got lost.\n\nThe statistic has not been received neutrally, said Douglas Besharov, a professor of public policy at the University of Maryland who specializes in children and poverty. He said that \"liberals like\" the SPM while \"conservatives dislike\" it.\n\nGiven the nature of the statistic as new and unofficial, economists we interviewed agreed that it would have been more appropriate if Smiley had specified that he was using an alternative measure. Otherwise, viewers would think he\u2019s talking about official poverty statistics.\n\n\"It strikes me as a very, very good idea to make clear to listeners when one is citing this new measure,\" said Arloc Sherman, a senior researcher with the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\nBiggs of the American Enterprise Institute agreed. \"If someone wants to use the alternate measure, I think they should be clear that it\u2019s not the official poverty line they\u2019re using,\" he said.\n\nOur ruling\n\nThe Census Bureau has produced a number that supports Smiley\u2019s claim that \"one out of two Americans \u2026 are living either in or near poverty. That means 150 million Americans, half of us.\" However, it is not the Census Bureau\u2019s official measure of poverty; that statistic would have shown no more than one-third of Americans to be near-poor. Failing to mention that it\u2019s an alternative statistic may leave a misleading impression with viewers. On balance, we rate the statement Half True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H.
