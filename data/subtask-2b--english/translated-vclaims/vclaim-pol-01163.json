The video is a project, and Clinton made observations during an interview with CNN in 2014. A 31-second video contains at least 13 million Facebook views. It continues to be shared within the framework of the ongoing national dialogue on cases of separation of migrant families reaching the border. The article was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The video has a consistent headline: \"Hilary on alien children in 2014: prepared by them.\" As the video plays, a text of Clinton's remarks is shown in the bottom of the video. The text highlights these special lines: \"But we have to send a clear message, just because your child crosses the border, that doesn't mean that the child will stay.\" The passage comes from June 17, 2014, CNN City Hall called \"Hard Choices Hillary Clinton,\" hosted by Christian Amanpour. Amanpur Clinton, who recently served as Secretary of State during Obama's administration, asked whether thousands of children coming across the border alone (without their parents) should be allowed to stay in the United States or be repatriated. The number of unaccompanied children reaching the southern border of the United States peaked in 2014. It is important to note that Clinton &apos; s remarks do not relate to family separation, a detail which may not be clear on the basis of the clip published on Facebook. Here's the context: Clinton: \"Well, two quick points. First, numbers are increasing dramatically. The main reason I think this is happening is because violence in some Central American countries is increasing dramatically. There is not enough law enforcement or will on the part of the Governments of those countries to try to deal with this dramatic increase in violence, drug trafficking, drug cartels and many children fleeing that violence. Amanpur: \"Do they have to be able to stay here? It's safer.\" On February 1, 2021, Tom Cotton mentioned in an interview with Fox and friends \"Many of these arriving immigrants, we have no way of checking their background for either health or security.\" By Miriam Valverde \u2022 3 February 2021 Clinton: \"Well -- it may be safer, but that's not the answer. I don't-- \"Amanpur: \"Does it have to be returned?\" Clinton: \"Well, first of all, we have to provide the best emergency care we can. We have children at the age of five and six who came from Central America. We need to do more to provide border security in southern Mexico.\" Amanpur: \"So, you're saying they should be returned now?\" Clinton: \"Well, they should be returned as soon as it is possible to identify the adults responsible for their families, because there are concerns about whether all of them can be returned. But I think that all those who can be reunited with their families. As Vice President Joe Baiden argues today in Central America, we need to do more. I started this when I was a secretary to deal with violence in this area to deal with border security. \"But we have to send a clear message, just because your child crosses the border, doesn't mean that the child stays. Therefore, we do not want to send a message that runs counter to our laws or that we will encourage more children to take that dangerous journey.\" Therefore, when Clinton spoke of children who arrived alone at the border, he said that children who could be returned should be sent. Clinton noted that not all children could be returned to their countries of origin. Our ruling version of a Facebook video called Hilary on Foreign Children 2014: Prepared by them. Clinton responded during a 2014 CNN interview to a question about children reaching the border. At that time, there was a surge in the number of children arriving alone, without their parents. Clinton said that children should be returned to responsible adults in their countries of origin, but noted that there were concerns about the reasonableness of all their return. The Facebook publication is accurate but needs further clarification or information. We're mostly assessing it right.
