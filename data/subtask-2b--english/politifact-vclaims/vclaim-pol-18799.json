Kamala Harris, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, broke Ohio election laws when she addressed voters outside of an early voting site in Cleveland.\n\"Three strikes for Kamala\u2019s campaign events Sunday, yells at people in line to vote in Ohio, may have broken laws,\" stated a headline on DJHJ Media, a conservative opinion website. A link to the article was posted on Facebook Oct. 26.\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe DJHJ story included a tweet by conservative actor James Woods that showed a video clip of Harris speaking Oct. 24 outside the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections building. Woods wrote \"you can literally be arrested for campaigning at a polling station.\" Neither the tweet nor the DJHJ article provided proof that Harris violated state laws restricting campaigning near a polling place.\u00a0\nCounty election officials told PolitiFact that Harris followed the law.\nOhio law sets boundaries to prevent campaigning too close to voters\nStates often have laws prohibiting electioneering at polling sites in an effort to protect voters from feeling intimidated. These laws usually set boundaries explaining how far people campaigning must stand from voters or an election site.\nOhio laws state that near polling sites:\n\n\nNo person can engage in any kind of election campaigning within 10 feet of any voter waiting in line.\n\n\nU.S. flags shall be placed 100 feet from a polling place to mark the zone where people can\u2019t campaign.\n\n\nNo person can \"solicit or in any manner attempt to influence any elector in casting the elector's vote.\"\n\n\nHarris spoke to a long line of voters on the first day of early in-person voting in Cuyahoga County, according to the press pool report by Buzzfeed reporter Henry Gomez. There was a \"massively long line of early voters snaked around the building on Euclid Avenue, down East 30th Street and around the block,\" he wrote.\nHarris spoke to the crowd using a cordless microphone before walking up and down the stretch of East 30th between Euclid and Chester and waving at voters.\u00a0\nIn a 39-second video by Seth Richardson, a Cleveland.com politics reporter, Harris didn\u2019t mention any candidates on the ballot but gave a pep talk about the importance of voting.\n\"Thank you for voting and voting early. Your vote is your voice, your voice is your vote, There is\u00a0 so much at stake \u2014 don\u2019t let anyone ever take your power. \u2026.\u00a0 You are going to make the difference,\" she said.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL. Lin Wood\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in an interview with the Patriotically Correct Radio Show\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"China was behind the interference and the effort to overthrow our government and the election, election fraud.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Daniel Funke \u2022 January 19, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHarris posted an 18-second video of the event on Twitter.\nAfter her brief comments, she danced to some music being played across the street by a DJ who called out \"Senator! Senator! Senator!\" according to the press pool report.\nAs for the 10 foot rule, eyeballing the video, Harris appears to be more than 10 feet from the voters lined up on the sidewalk. She\u2019s separated from the line by two traffic lanes, which are typically about 10 feet wide in urban areas.\nWe couldn\u2019t see the flags in the Twitter videos of Harris marking the 100 foot barrier. But Harris was speaking to voters in a line that extended beyond the election office.\nWKSU, public radio in Ohio, wrote that Harris \"made a brief stop across the street from the line \u2014 and outside the 100 foot neutral zone \u2014 to thank people for voting.\"\nTony Kaloger, Cuyahoga\u2019s election and compliance administrator, sent us a statement about the unannounced visit by Harris to the earling voting site.\u00a0\nSeveral local elections employees including the director \"were outside during the majority of her stop and witnessed no violations of Ohio's electioneering laws,\" the statement said.\nHarris did not come onto the property of the elections center. She was surrounded by Secret Service agents, and no voter or bystander was permitted to approach her.\u00a0\n\"There are several officers on-site at the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections Early Vote Center tasked mainly with managing traffic and voter flow,\" the statement said. \"They will step in to assist our staff with the enforcement of the neutral zone (100 feet from the entrance or 10 feet from the voters in line when the line extends further than 100 feet) as necessary. No assistance was required during the Senator's visit.\"\nThe county pointed to a two-page excerpt from a 2019 directive from Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican, that explains where people are allowed to campaign. Part of that directive says:\n\"Nothing in Ohio\u2019s election laws prohibit a person or entity from campaigning, displaying campaign material, or distributing food outside of the neutral zone of a polling location (i.e., outside of the flags marking the 100 foot barrier or beyond 10 feet from any elector waiting in line to vote, if the line to vote extends beyond the flags).\"\nSabrina Singh, a spokesperson for Harris, said Harris \"stood behind the 100 foot boundary line beyond the neutral zone.\"\nOur ruling\nA headline in a story posted on Facebook stated that Harris \"may have broken laws\" when she campaigned outside a voting site in Ohio.\nA county election official said that Harris did not violate laws against electioneering near a polling site. Police officers were on site during the visit by Harris and are allowed to help election officials enforce the neutral zone, but the county said that wasn\u2019t required.\nWe rate this statement False.\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click here, for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18799"}
