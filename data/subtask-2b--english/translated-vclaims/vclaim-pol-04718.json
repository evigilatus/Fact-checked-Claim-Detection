But that's not his only record.", "text": "They say the third time is Christ. For Donald Trump, his third claim about a historical display at the main GOP finally hit a mark. First, he jumped on the gun. After that, he overestimated his margin of victory. But in a speech delivered in Raleigh on July 5, Trump accurately described his historic achievement. He said: \"We have the highest number of votes in the history of the Republican Party,\" speaking only of the initial elections - general elections have not yet, of course, taken place. How can Trump avoid some of the laps he's made in the past with this unexpectedly difficult claim? In April, he claimed to have obtained the largest number of votes from any Republican candidate at all. Bolivi Fukte evaluated this mistake because he didn't get the highest number of votes ever. But Trump, as mentioned in the article, had the opportunity to reach out to this teacher with strong appearances at some of the next preliminary stages. Then on June 1, Trump said he broke the record by millions of votes. \"Bolivi Fruitte\" also evaluated that statement as a liar. Trump finally broke the record, but only by a small amount. Did Trump make a valid claim in one breath just to reveal the truth next time? We asked. Yeah, he did. But he finally got it right by avoiding any decorating, sticking to allegations of a broken record victory. According to the clear real policy, Trump received about 13.3 million votes during the primary elections. This is about 1.8 million more votes than the previous record, recorded by George W. Bush. On Tuesday, Trump spoke of winning in the face of the crowded main field and the \"untouchable system,\" and then dropped the name of some GOP elders whose total votes were eclipsed. \"Not only did the Republican Party go away from what it was four years ago -- the way, the way up -- but Donald Trump, in the history of the Statute, the Republican Party, with 17 people working -- a lot of people don't understand, when you say 17 people -- you got almost 14 million votes,\" said Trump. \"More than anyone in the history of the Republican Party. More than Ronald Reagan. More than Push. More than Richard Nixon. More than Dwight D. Eisenhower, who won World War II; certainly helped a lot.\" \"We obtained the highest number of votes in the history of the Republican Party,\" continued. \"It was a big deal to me.\" We've won 37 states. We got stronger and stronger and stronger.\" On January 26, 2021, in the North Carolina tweet, Secretary of State Ellen Marshall, Jenna Woodsworth stated, \"She has won state-wide races more than anyone else is likely to be alive.\" \u25cf February 1, 2012, recorded less doubt, but does his record mean that Trump is the most popular Republican candidate ever? No. What Trump did not mention is that during these initial elections, most Republican voters voted in favour of someone else. More than 16 million people voted for another candidate, according to the Washington Post analysis. To be fair, Trump was facing a crowded main field, which he mentioned in his speech. However, 13 of his 16 challengers did not make much of the sprinkler. However, the first three competitors - Ted Cruz, John Cassich and Marco Rubio, in this arrangement - met to get more than 15 million votes. So Trump now has two initial GOP records: most votes in favour, and most votes against. Previously, John McCain was holding the most opposition to the records. As the National Convention approaches, it should also be noted that Trump is not the only first contestant on the GOP programme who received less than half of his party &apos; s votes in the primary elections, but only one of a few votes. The results of the nomination in previous cases were mixed. McCain won the nomination in 2008, although he received less than half of the votes, as Barry Goldwater did in 1964. But the first contestants in 1968 (Ronald Reagan) and 1952 (Robert Taft) entered the conference with less than 50% of the initial votes and ended up losing their candidacy. Finally, it should be noted that some historical comparisons of totals and percentages of votes are barely apples to apples. The current statute is a relatively new process. As a political scientist said earlier to Paulette Fuckett, \"Before the 1970s, candidates in many pre-elections and rallies did not stand for delegates,\" because party leaders had more influence than they now have, and national conferences were usually contested no matter what. Our referee Trump said he got most of the votes in the history of the Republican Party's statutes. That's right. He received 13.3 million votes, defeating George W. Bush's 11.5 million votes record. But what Trump did not mention is that he also keeps the record of most of the votes cast against a key candidate, and that he is only one of the few Republican candidates in recent history supported by less than half of the party &apos; s main voters. Since Trump's claim was accurate but not in that context, this claim was assessed as mostly true. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/be10f613-3754-43fd-9d02-e89f00619253", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04718"}
