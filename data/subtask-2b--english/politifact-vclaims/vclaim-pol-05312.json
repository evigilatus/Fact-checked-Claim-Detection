He then drew a contrast with what whites experience. \u00a0\n\"When you\u2019re white, you don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be living in a ghetto. You don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be poor. You don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be hassled when you walk down the street or you get dragged out of a car,\" Sanders said.\nSeveral readers asked us to take a closer look at Sanders\u2019 comment that \"when you're white ... you don't know what it's like to be poor.\"\nSanders' point was that white people haven\u2019t had to contend with racism based on skin color. But when he moves into the subject of whites\u2019 experience with poverty, he\u2019s on weak ground. Sanders\u2019 suggestion that white Americans haven\u2019t experienced poverty is undercut by statistics calculated by the U.S. Census Bureau.\nSince the 1960s, the Census Bureau has tracked the numbers and percentages of Americans by race who have an income level that puts them at the poverty line. Here\u2019s the most recent data, for 2014:\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nCategory\n\n\nNumber in poverty\n\n\nPoverty rate\n\n\n\n\nAmericans of all races\n\n\n46.7 million\n\n\n14.8 percent\n\n\n\n\nWhite\n\n\n19.7 million\n\n\n10.1 percent\n\n\n\n\nAfrican-American\n\n\n10.8 million\n\n\n26.2 percent\n\n\n\n\nHispanic\n\n\n13.1 million\n\n\n23.6 percent\n\n\n\n\nAsian-American\n\n\n2.1 million\n\n\n12.0 percent\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nBy this measure, Sanders was certainly wrong to suggest that whites haven\u2019t experienced poverty. In 2014, there were actually more white Americans in poverty -- 19.7 million -- than members of any other group.\nPart of the reason, of course, is that there are more white Americans than there are members of minority groups overall. (Whites account for 62 percent of the population.) Still, even though whites have a lower poverty rate than other groups -- roughly 10 percent -- even that percentage is hardly trivial.\nThe numbers are similar if you raise the income level slightly. At 125 percent of the poverty level, the number of white Americans rises to about 26.5 million. That\u2019s a lot of white people who are in or near poverty.\n\"This was a misstatement. A lot of white people know what it\u2019s like to be poor,\" said Julia Isaacs, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute.\nIf you look at the poor as a group, minorities are disproportionately represented. Still, the white population is large enough that the majority of the people in poverty are white. That\u2019s been the case since at least 1970.\nWe calculated the racial and ethnic makeup of the population at the poverty line in roughly 10-year intervals, using data for the four categories above. Census data is available back to 1990 for all four groups, and they exist for all but Asians back to about 1970.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nYear\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercentage of people in poverty who were white\n\n\nPercentage of people in poverty who were black\n\n\nPercentage of people in poverty who were Hispanic\n\n\nPercentage of people in poverty who were Asian\n\n\n\n\n2014\n\n\n54\n\n\n19\n\n\n23\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n2010\n\n\n54\n\n\n19\n\n\n24\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n2000\n\n\n56\n\n\n21\n\n\n20\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n1990\n\n\n57\n\n\n25\n\n\n15\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n1980\n\n\n62\n\n\n27\n\n\n11\n\n\nNA\n\n\n\n\n1970\n\n\n64\n\n\n28\n\n\n9*\n\n\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n* Data is for 1972\nIt\u2019s easiest to grasp the scope of white poverty when using the following graphic, which was provided to us by Christopher Wimer, a research scientist at the Columbia University Population Research Center. It\u2019s similar to the chart above, except that it uses a more precise, though still experimental, measurement of poverty that is adjusted for geography, government benefits and other factors not captured in the traditional poverty measurement.\nThe share of whites in the population of Americans in poverty is shown in purple. As the chart indicates, the white share has fallen, but it\u2019s still the largest of any of the four groups studied.\n\nSanders said the day after the debate that he misspoke, telling reporters, \"What I meant to say is when you talk about ghettos traditionally, what you talk about is African-American communities. There is nobody on this campaign \u2026 who's talked about poverty, whether it's in the white community, the black community, the Latino community, more than I have.\"\nOur ruling\nSanders says that \"when you're white ... you don't know what it's like to be poor.\" On the contrary -- the most recent figures show that nearly 20 million white Americans are experiencing poverty. While that\u2019s\u00a0smaller as a percentage than it is for other racial and ethnic groups, that\u2019s still a lot of people. In raw numbers, it\u2019s actually more than any other group.
