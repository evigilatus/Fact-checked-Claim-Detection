Bush was president, and from June 2009 until June 2013, during Obama\u2019s tenure.\nUnder Obama\u2019s recovery, private-sector employment increased by a little under 6.05 million, compared to 3.17 million during the equivalent period during the Bush recovery.\nThat\u2019s \"nearly twice as many jobs,\" as Obama said. And experts say this is a credible way of measuring the numbers.\nBut it isn\u2019t the only way.\nInstead of starting the clock at the official end of the recovery, one could start it from the low point in private-sector employment. These aren\u2019t the same dates, because a low point private-sector employment isn\u2019t the determining factor for pinpointing the end of a recession.\nUsing this method makes Obama\u2019s recovery less impressive. During the Bush recovery, private-sector employment continued to tumble all the way to July 2003 -- a year and a half after the recession\u2019s official end. By comparison, during the Obama recovery, private-sector employment began to rise in February 2010, just eight months after the official end of the recession. So the extended slide in private-sector jobs under Bush artificially reduced the number of jobs created during the first part of his recovery.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you count from the low point in private-sector jobs instead, the Bush recovery produced 6.35 million private-sector jobs in the first 41 months, compared to 7.20 million in the first 41 months of Obama\u2019s recovery.\nThat\u2019s modestly more private-sector jobs under Obama -- but it\u2019s not \"nearly twice as many jobs,\" as he had said.\nThere\u2019s also a third way to look at it -- looking at all jobs, not just private-sector jobs. Using this measurement casts an even more unfavorable light on the Obama recovery, since the government sector has been among the hardest-hit of any job category in the current recession.\nIf you start counting private and government jobs from the low point in employment, the Bush recovery generated slightly more than 7 million total jobs, which actually exceeds the 6.58 million jobs created in the Obama recovery.\nTwo economists we interviewed -- Gary Burtless of the Brookings Institution and Tara Sinclair of George Washington University -- agreed that the alternative measurements are also valid. But by choosing the more favorable of the two statistics, Sinclair said, \"I think he's cherry-picking. To in any way claim that this labor market is better than what we had in the mid-2000s just doesn't sound fair to me.\"\nTo be fair, Burtless said, Obama did acknowledge elsewhere in his speech that, \"I\u2019m here to tell you today that we're not there yet. We all know that. We're not there yet. We've got more work to do.\"\nThe role of Obamacare\nObama used the line we\u2019re checking as a way of countering Republican claims that the president\u2019s signature health care law is a job-killer.\nThe reality is that no one knows yet how much of a job-killer the law is going to be, or if it will be a job-killer at all. Many key provisions of the health care law haven\u2019t kicked in yet. That includes new rules with fines for large businesses that don\u2019t provide their employees with health care. Republicans say the new rules could drive some employers to shed employees or turn them into part-time employees.\nSinclair said it\u2019s possible that some companies may have pre-emptively cut down on employee hours or laid off workers due to the fear of looming Obamacare mandates, or due to certain Obamacare taxes being imposed. However, even if this is happening, it\u2019s impossible to quantify the impact with any specificity. Obamacare\u2019s impact on the currently available job data -- either positive or negative -- is still highly speculative.\nOur ruling\nObama said, \"Our businesses have created nearly twice as many jobs in this recovery as they had at the same point in the last recovery, when there was no Obamacare.\" Obama\u2019s carefully worded claim uses the most advantageous time frame to measure job growth. Other metrics show that the job recovery he has presided over has been similar to, or even weaker than, the job recovery under Bush. So we rate the claim Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09064"}
