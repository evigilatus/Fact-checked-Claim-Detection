Chris Christie\u2019s first year in office, as somber music plays in the background.\n\"Trenton politicians cut $1.3 billion from education,\" Briggs says, adding that those cuts resulted in larger class sizes, less money for books and materials, and fewer computers for students.\nFor this claim we\u2019re looking only at how much was cut in state aid \u2013 and in this case, the NJEA\u2019s claim is correct.\nLet\u2019s begin by looking back at some of the fiscal matters challenging Christie shortly after he took office in January 2010.\nFaced with major revenue loss to the state as a result of the recession, Christie began making cuts in several areas of the budget. Education took among the biggest hits. The governor withheld $475 million in state aid that January and then cut another $820 million from the fiscal year 2011 budget. The FY11 plan covered the school year starting in September 2010.\nThe National Bureau of Economic Research has defined the recession as lasting from December 2007 through June 2009.\nCombined, the education cuts totaled just under $1.3 billion.\nNJEA spokesman Steve Wollmer noted that the $475 million would have paid for things such as new classrooms, vehicles, special education placements and more. The result, he said, was larger class sizes, a loss of education personnel and programs being cut.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd the impact of those cuts are still being felt, he said.\n\"Districts are going to get squeezed more and more,\" Wollmer said. \"That\u2019s the bottom line.\"\nBut Christie had to put more education money in the budget after the state Supreme Court in 2011 ordered him to increase aid to poor school districts by about $500 million the next fiscal year. The order resulted from a lawsuit that claimed the education cuts violated the 2008 School Funding Reform Act, which was a funding formula to support the state\u2019s poorest districts.\nChristie maintained that the cuts were necessary to balance the budget, as required by state law.\nBut New Jersey\u2019s education funding drama didn\u2019t end with the increased aid for poorer districts.\nThe NJEA\u2019s ad also notes that many of New Jersey\u2019s school districts received a $1 increase in state aid under the current Fiscal Year 2014 budget. Still other districts had aid totals that stayed the same from the year prior.\nIt's worth noting that as the economy has improved, Christie and the Legislature have put more money in the budget for education.\nOur ruling\nA recent video ad by the NJEA claims, \"Trenton politicians cut $1.3 billion from education.\"\nChristie made two rounds of cuts between the time he took office in January 2010 and in the FY 2011 budget, which was ultimately approved by the state Legislature. The combined cuts totaled just under $1.3 billion.\nAlthough some aid has since been restored, the NJEA claim is correct about the amount of the cuts. We rate the claim True.\nTo comment on this story, go to NJ.com.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08905"}
