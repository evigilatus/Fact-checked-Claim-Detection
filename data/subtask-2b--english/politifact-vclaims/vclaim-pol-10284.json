It depends on who\u2019s doing the counting, apparently.\n\nAnd with about five weeks to Election Day on Nov. 6, the issue of tax hikes is one of the latest volleys in the heated Bob Menendez-Joe Kyrillos campaign for U.S. Senate.\n\nThe Kyrillos campaign, for example, claims Menendez, a Democrat, has never met a tax increase he didn\u2019t like \u2013 and support.\n\n\"Bob Menendez actually voted in favor of higher taxes more than 70 times!\" states an Aug. 29 news release posted on a campaign website for Kyrillos, a Republican from Monmouth County.\n\n\"These are direct votes against tax cuts as well as votes to raise taxes, votes in favor of reducing proposed tax cuts, votes for non-binding resolutions supporting taxes, among others,\" Kyrillos spokeswoman Meaghan Cronin said in an e-mail that included a list of 72 Menendez votes.\n\nThe Kyrillos campaign\u2019s claim has a degree of accuracy, but there\u2019s some important context missing.\n\nOur analysis of the 72 shows that in many cases, Menendez\u2019s votes support or give tax breaks to the middle class by reducing or eliminating tax breaks for the wealthy and big business. Many of Menendez\u2019s votes were for education, needy children, agriculture, the environment and the disabled. Still others were for national security and safety.\n\nBut there are some issues with those votes. More than half of the 72 do not actually change tax policy or law. Others have to do with procedural rules for voting, which also cannot change law.\n\nLet\u2019s look at two examples.\n\nMenendez in 2006 voted to increase a congressional spending limit by $965 million to put more money toward port security. That money would be offset by ending certain corporate tax breaks.\n\nIn 2011, Menendez voted to end debate on a bill asking those earning $1 million or more to make \"meaningful contributions\" to help reduce the deficit. That procedure then allows an immediate vote.\n\nFor some, the senator\u2019s intent is key.\n\n\"This is not to take a partisan side either way but I would think most people reading about a record like this would ask the simple question, what the intent of the person was casting the vote, besides what the actual outcome was,\" said Pete Sepp, a spokesman with the National Taxpayers Union in Alexandria, Va. The NTU advocates for lower taxes and smaller government.\n\nSeth Hanlon, director of fiscal reform for the liberal-leaning Center for American Progress Action Fund, had context concerns.\n\n\"This controversy that they\u2019re having here is, if you get past the semantics, it\u2019s basically about whose tax cuts we\u2019re talking about: Tax cuts for the middle class he supports very consistently or supporting tax breaks for very wealthy people, millionaires, oil companies, corporate tax breaks,\" Hanlon said. \"We need to look through the semantics and look at the record on middle class tax cuts.\"\n\nPaul Brubaker, Menendez\u2019s communications director, said the vote list shows Menendez\u2019s support for siding with the middle class over millionaires and corporate special interests.\n\nAnd there\u2019s another issue to consider: is voting against a tax benefit for one group in order to fund a tax break for another group the same as a tax increase? That\u2019s the case for many of the resolutions that can\u2019t change tax law.\n\nPolitiFact National addressed that question in an August fact-check about a U.S. Senate race in Florida in which the Republican incumbent accused his Democratic challenger of voting 150 times to raise taxes.\n\nOur colleagues spoke with a few federal budget experts who generally agreed that a vote against a tax cut doesn\u2019t equal a tax increase.\n\nChapin Fay, Kyrillos\u2019 campaign manager, disagreed.\n\n\"All of the votes we cite are votes in favor of higher taxes,\" he said in an e-mail.\n\nOur ruling\n\nThe Kyrillos campaign claims in a news release that \"Bob Menendez actually voted in favor of higher taxes more than 70 times!\"\n\nMore than half of the votes cited by the Kyrillos campaign have no effect on tax law or are procedural matters. There also are Menendez votes that give or extend tax breaks to the middle class at the expense of the wealthy and corporations \u2013 but federal budget experts have said that a tax break for one group isn\u2019t the same as a tax increase for another.\n\nMenendez did vote in favor of bills that would mean higher taxes, so there\u2019s an element of truth to the claim. But since so many of the bills would have no effect on tax law or policy, that\u2019s a critical fact that would give a different impression \u2013 and that meets the definition for Mostly False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the 2017 tax law, \u201cpeople who make under $75,000 will have their taxes raised in 2021 and every 2 years after that until 2027.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo comment on this story, go to NJ.com.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10284"}
