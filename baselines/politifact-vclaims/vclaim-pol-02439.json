It is. The story took a quote by a consultant who served in George W. Bush\u2019s administration and and falsely attributed it to Parton.\nEarlier this month, Brett Decker\u00a0spoke about consumer confidence and the economy. in a radio interview with Breitbart.\n\"Trump in one year is already better than 16 years of those guys put together,\" he said.\nThe Americanproud.info story also used an actual quote by Parton in an interview with CNN in August 2016, but omitted the full context of her comments.\n\"We\u2019re doing good,\" Parton told CNN. \"We got a woman that could go in the White House, so we\u2019ve certainly come a long way in that respect.\"\nAmericanpround.info included that snippet in its report, but went on to say that Parton \"saw the light\" and later called Hillary Clinton \"nuts\" and that her campaign has been \"just crazy.\"\nIn reality, all those comments were actually from the same CNN interview, but Americanproud.info distorted what Parton actually said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen asked about Clinton and Trump, here\u2019s Parton\u2019s full remarks:\n\"I don't know where they're going to land but I think they're both nuts\" she said, joking that \"it's like watching the OJ Simpson trial. You just believe whoever's up next. Whoever testified last is who you believe.\"\nIn the CNN interview, Parton doesn\u2019t come across as committed to either candidate. CNN paraphrased her as saying she might not know who she will vote for and that it's time that both Trump and Clinton stopped talking about each other.\nIn June 2016, the New York Times asked Parton how she felt about a female presidential nominee.\n\"Well, I think that that would be wonderful. Hillary might make as good a president as anybody ever has. I think no matter if it\u2019s Hillary or Donald Trump, we\u2019re gonna be plagued with PMS either way \u2014 presidential mood swings! But I personally think a woman would do a great job. I think Hillary\u2019s very qualified. So if she gets it, I\u2019ll certainly be behind her.\"\nAfter much publicity about that quote, Parton issued a statement.\n\"My comment about supporting a woman in the White House was taken out of context. I have not endorsed Hillary Clinton nor Donald Trump. I try not to get political but if I am, I might as well just run myself 'cause I've got the hair for it, it's huge, and they could always use more boobs in the race.\"\nProclaiming that a celebrity now loves Trump or hates Clinton is a common theme in fake news stories. We debunked an article that said Sandra Bullock said to Clinton \"if you don\u2019t like our president you can leave and never come back again\" and that \"Julia Roberts claims \u2018Michelle Obama isn\u2019t fit to clean Melania\u2019s toilet\u2019 \" We rated both statements Pants on Fire.\nIn this case, the story that said Parton said, \"Trump in one year is already better than 16 years of Bush, Obama put together\" is also fake news. A consultant actually made a statement that virtually mirrors that quote.\nWe rate this story Pants on Fire.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/88e43b7a-6460-47db-ada2-bdb92e031093", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02439"}
