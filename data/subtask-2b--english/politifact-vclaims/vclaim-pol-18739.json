It resembles a similar spot released Sept. 16, which also cut Biden\u2019s South Carolina remarks out of context and made claims about his tax plan.\u00a0\nBut Biden and his campaign have been clear throughout the campaign that he intends to focus any direct tax increases on the wealthiest people and corporations.\nBiden has repeatedly pledged to avoid raising taxes on Americans earning less than $400,000 per year. Independent tax analysts who assessed Biden\u2019s plan in the spring and summer of 2020 agreed that it does not call for direct tax increases on anyone below that threshold.\nSome lower earners could see small hits to their after-tax incomes due to the indirect effects of Biden\u2019s proposed increase to the corporate tax rate, the early tax analyses said. But the highest earners and corporations would be hit hardest under Biden\u2019s proposals, which include:\n\n\nIncreasing the top corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%.\n\n\nRaising the top federal marginal income tax rate for individuals to 39.6%.\n\n\nPlacing a 12.4% Social Security payroll tax on incomes above $400,000.\n\n\nTaxing capital gains at the same rate as ordinary income for very high earners.\n\n\nSeveral of the same tax groups have since updated their analyses to incorporate a number of tax credits Biden has proposed that would target middle-class and lower earners.\u00a0\nThe updated reports from the Tax Foundation, American Enterprise Institute, Tax Policy Center and Penn Wharton Budget Model show Biden\u2019s plan bringing in smaller overall tax revenues, because of the tax credits, than original estimates assumed.\u00a0\nThe updated analyses also show the tax credits offsetting the indirect effects facing lower earners as a result of the increased corporate tax rate in the first year under Biden\u2019s plan.\u00a0\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe Trump ad distorts what Biden was saying\nHere\u2019s a look at how the ad presents Biden\u2019s words out of context:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow the ad quotes Biden: \"If you elect me, your taxes are going to be raised, not cut.\"\nThe missing context: This quote is from a Feb. 27 campaign event in Conway, South Carolina. The Trump campaign ad gives the misleading impression that Biden told the crowd he plans on raising taxes on all Americans if elected president. But that\u2019s not what he said.\nThe full context shows Biden was addressing one person who indicated moments earlier that he or she had benefited from the tax bill that became law under Trump. The ad cuts out the part of the clip where Biden specified that taxes would be raised \"if you benefited from that.\"\n\"Well, you did. Well that\u2019s good. I\u2019m glad to see you\u2019re doing well already,\" Biden said, directly addressing that person in the audience. \"But guess what, if you elect me, your taxes are going to be raised, not cut, if you benefited from that.\"\n\nHow the ad quotes Biden: \"And here\u2019s how it works. I\u2019m going to raise taxes.\"\nThe missing context: This quote is from an Oct. 10 campaign event in Erie, Pa. The Trump campaign ad cuts Biden\u2019s remarks short, leaving out the ensuing lines in which Biden specified that his tax plan would only raise taxes for corporations and the highest earners.\nThe full context shows Biden was talking about his plan to spur job growth and an economic recovery from the recession brought on by the pandemic.\n\"And here\u2019s how it works. I\u2019m going to raise taxes,\" Biden said. \"I\u2019m not going to raise taxes on anybody making less than 400 grand. But you won\u2019t pay a penny more. But those making more than that, I\u2019m going to ask them to finally begin to pay their fair share. I\u2019m going to ask the big corporations and the wealthy to begin to pay.\"\n\nHow the ad quotes Biden: \"You\u2019re going to get a tax raise.\"\nThe missing context: This quote is from an Oct. 12 campaign event in Toledo, Ohio. The Trump campaign ad again omits key portions of Biden\u2019s remarks. The full context shows he was talking about raising taxes on people with taxable incomes over $400,000 per year.\n\"I\u2019m not going to raise taxes on anyone who makes less than $400,000 a year,\" Biden said. \"If you make more than 400, beep your horn, because you\u2019re going to get a tax raise. Well, I\u2019m going to raise your tax slightly, if you\u2019re making over 400. But look, you\u2019re not going to pay a penny more. In fact, tens of millions of middle-class families are going to get a tax cut when they need it most. Raising their kids, trying to get affordable healthcare, buying their first home, or saving for retirement. But I\u2019m going to ask big corporations and the super wealthy just to begin to start to pay their fair share. I\u2019m going to raise back the tax cut he gave for corporate America.\"\n\nOur ruling\nA Trump campaign ad claims Biden repeatedly told Americans he's going to raise their taxes.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s not what Biden actually said in the three clips highlighted in the ad, which were edited to pluck specific comments out of context. And it\u2019s not what Biden\u2019s tax plan would do, either.\nBiden and his campaign have repeatedly said his tax plan does not call for direct tax increases on anyone making less than $400,000 per year.\nWe rate this ad\u2019s claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18739"}
