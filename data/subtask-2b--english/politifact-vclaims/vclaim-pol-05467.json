To read the latest, see this fact-check.\u00a0\nAs New Hampshire officials work to contain the state\u2019s opioid crisis, presidential candidates have been called upon to address the problem and offer solutions. At an editorial board meeting with Monitor staff, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush outlined his plan -- and dropped an interesting statistic.\nBush said Americans have a tendency to overmedicate in general, but addictive painkillers are even worse. \"I read this, I believe, that 90 percent of all pain medications are prescribed in the United States in the world,\" Bush said.\nCould this be true? Are so many of the world\u2019s pain medications dispensed in this country alone? We decided to check out the number and its origins.\nBush\u2019s New Hampshire campaign staff said the candidate misspoke; he meant to say 80 percent, not 90. The article Bush was referring to was by Dr. Sanjay Gupta and published last year on CNN.com.\n\"We were stunned to learn 80 percent of the world's pain pills are consumed in the United States,\" Gupta writes.\nThat number doesn\u2019t just appear in CNN\u2019s reporting, though. ABC News cited it in 2011. The BBC mentioned it in coverage a year later.\nAs noted by the Bush campaign -- and independently verified by PolitiFact New Hampshire -- the statistic originates with the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians, a group based in Kentucky with some 4,500 members.\nThe group reports in a fact sheet that the United States, with \"only 4.6 percent of the world\u2019s population, has been consuming 80 percent of the global opioid supply, and 99 percent of the global hydrocodone supply, as well as two-thirds of the world\u2019s illegal drugs.\"\nPapers published in Pain Physician -- ASIPP\u2019s quarterly journal -- \u00a0are the source of those numbers. That 80 percent figure appeared in a paper published in 2008, and has been repeated in the organization\u2019s literature, including testimony to the U.S. Senate.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut while these numbers were the source of Bush\u2019s statement, they date from 2008. Out of curiosity, we decided to search for another, more recent version of the information.\nLuckily, there\u2019s a separate source for such data, and it\u2019s the United Nations. The group\u2019s International Narcotics Control Board issues yearly papers about narcotic drug use around the world. While it publishes a general report, it also puts out technical reports, which detail the actual use of such substances globally.\nAnd according to the group\u2019s 2014 report, its most recent, the United States consumes 78 percent of the world\u2019s oxycodone (known as Oxycontin). It\u2019s also reported to use 99 percent of the world\u2019s hydrocodone (it\u2019s Vicodin when combined with acetaminophen) and used 51 percent of the world\u2019s hydromorphone (Dilaudid).\nEarlier versions of this set of statistics appear in a 2012 Newsday piece, a 2013 New Yorker article and a 2014 New York Times blog post.\nAnd Bush\u2019s larger point that Americans generally over-medicate is supported, too.\nAccording to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the United States uses 75 percent of all of the world\u2019s prescription drugs, period. Again, the United States has just under 5 percent of the world population.\nOur ruling\nBush said that, globally, \"90 percent of all pain medications are prescribed in the United States.\" In the context of the conversation, it was clear that Bush was referring to opioid painkillers.\nThe most up-to-date information suggests that the United States uses the majority of the world\u2019s supply of popular versions of such drugs. And statistics from a few years ago put that overall percentage at 80 percent.\nThe exact number Bush used isn\u2019t far off from commonly available statistics, and his campaign acknowledged that he misspoke. His overall point, however, was correct. We rank his statement Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05467"}
