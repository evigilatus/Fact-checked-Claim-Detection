Tom Letson suggests that Ohio Gov. John Kasich wanted campaign kickbacks from Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation rebate recipients", "text": "Ohio Gov. John Kasich made news last month when he proposed returning $1 billion in insurance premiums to more than 200,000 public and private employers.\n\n\nThe rebates, later approved by the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation board, could be worth up to millions of dollars and are possible thanks to an unexpected surplus in bureau funds.\n\n\nA couple of weeks later, the Republican Kasich noted the accomplishment among others in an email sent to his campaign\u2019s listserv. The email drew the ire of State Rep. Tom Letson.\n\n\nA statement sent by Letson\u2019s office called Kasich campaign\u2019s email as a \"fundraising pitch to cash in\" on the rebates. Letson asserted that Kasich was \"raising money from an injured workers\u2019 fund\" and that the governor has \"directly tied BWC rebates to\" political donations.\n\n\n\"It is as if the Governor is implying that a portion of the rebate should be directed back to him in the form of campaign cash,\" said Letson, a four-term Democrat from Warren.\n\n\nPolitiFact Ohio decided that Letson\u2019s provocative claim was worth a closer look.\n\n\nLet\u2019s start with the email from Kasich\u2019s campaign. Letson\u2019s office attached a copy to his statement. We confirmed its authenticity after a Kasich aide forwarded us the original.\n\n\nThe campaign email\u2019s subject line: \"$1 billion back.\" Here is the entire text:\n\n\n[Supporter], did you hear the recent news about the $1 billion coming back to Ohio taxpayers? Governor Kasich recently announced that Ohio's Bureau of Workers' Compensation would be returning $1 billion back to public and private employers in a move that\u2019s aimed to help spur job creation. This plan has received a lot of praise and you can read some of the coverage below.\n\n\nAlso, a recent survey of CEOs named Ohio as having the most improved business climate of all the other states in the country. It's great to see our reforms getting so much attention but there's still a lot more work to do and we\u2019ll need your help to keep up the momentum.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, Gov. Kasich joined a Mahoning Valley company in announcing the creation of new jobs and hundreds of millions of dollars of investment in the local economy. You can read more about this great news here.\n\n\nBelow are some more things for you to read and please take a moment to help us share some of them with your Facebook friends:\n\n\nWe share the entire text, with the Kasich campaign\u2019s bolded emphasis added, to show that there is no direct fundraising pitch in the text. The closest the campaign comes is the line about how Kasich has \"a lot more work to do\" and needs \"your help to keep up the momentum.\"\n\n\nImmediately below the text were photos and headlines that link to six articles shared on the campaign\u2019s website. At the very bottom of the email were two button-style links. One, labeled \"Donate Today\", links to the contribution page on the campaign\u2019s website. The \"Donate\" button was not displayed next to any mention of the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation rebate offer.\n\n\nPolitiFact Ohio reached out to Letson\u2019s office. Keary McCarthy, chief of staff for the Ohio House Democrats, responded on the lawmaker\u2019s behalf. He argued that because the email included the \"Donate\" button at the bottom, it qualified as a fundraising pitch. Because the email noted the rebate program, McCarthy said it\u2019s fair to link the rebates to a plea for campaign money.\n\n\n\"Donate\" buttons are common on nearly every email sent by a political campaign. Many emails are much more explicit, whether by suggesting specific contribution amounts or making it clear that the supporter\u2019s donation is important to meeting an incremental goal or winning a race.\n\n\nMcCarthy stressed other points from Letson\u2019s statement, which referred to past \"horrible missteps\" at the workers\u2019 compensation agency. That\u2019s a reference to the Coingate scandal during the Taft administration, in which lax oversight of investments cost taxpayers millions of dollars. Tom Noe, a Republican fundraiser, went to prison for raiding a $50 million portfolio he had managed for the agency.\n\n\nThat context helps explain what type of behavior Letson is concerned about. But Letson spoke of misbehavior as if it already was occurring. So, do the facts back him up? Let\u2019s review.\n\n\nIn an email to campaign supporters, Kasich\u2019s campaign touted the workers\u2019 comp rebate program and two other recent accomplishments. The email included links to articles about these and other accomplishments and, at the very bottom, a link for those who wished to donate. So there is a fundraising element to the email.\n\n\nLetson said it was \"as if the Governor is implying that a portion of the rebate should be directed back to him in the form of campaign cash.\" He is not merely asserting that Kasich was trying to raise money in the email. Rather, Letson is positing something very specific: that Kasich was asking rebate recipients to kick back some of their savings to the governor\u2019s campaign.\n\n\nThat\u2019s a serious accusation. And though Letson hedges with words such as \"as if\" and \"implying,\" that doesn\u2019t excuse the gravity of his claim. We don\u2019t think anyone could reasonably come away from Kasich\u2019s email with the impression he implied what Letson says he did.\n\n\nPolitiFact Ohio has a rating for such absurd statements: Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09247"}
