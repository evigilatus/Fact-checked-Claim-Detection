Exit polls show moderate and independent voters powered both of his victories. But when the schedule moves to states like Florida, where primaries are closed to independents, his need for Republican support becomes critical.\n\n\nThe exit polls show that McCain didn't lose among Republicans in either state. When you factor in a margin of error, both are statistical ties. But what McCain said was that he \"won the majority\" of Republicans in those states, and we don't find any evidence that that's true. We rule McCain's statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16386"}
