During the press discussion of why Trump had not yet released his tax returns, Alex Castianos ran the Republican Strategic Table, saying that not-for-profit organizations named Clinton did little but enrich their family. \"Because the idea that the Clinton Foundation is somehow this wonderful thing that helps people, most charities give 75 percent of their money in direct aid. The Clinton Foundation offers less than 10 (percentage). In 2013, they raised $140 million, and they gave 9 million people direct assistance, as Castellanos said. We have heard different accounts of this allegation (from the former presidential candidate of the General Democratic Party Carly Fiorina, the provincial host of Radio Rush Limbo and President of the Republican National Council Raines Bribos). It's misleading. The figures for Castellanos do not take into account the bulk of the institution &apos; s work. The Foundation spends a lot of money on charity, not through grants, but through its own programming. Tax revenues show that Clinton raised just under $143 million and spent about $85 million, including $9 million in grants to other organizations. But this does not include all the charity work of the Foundation, \"Granting is not part of its mission, and this creates confusion - because many people imagine that foundations are involved in giving up money,\" writes David Callahan, the editor of domestic charity. Despite its name, the Clinton Foundation is not in fact a private institution (e.g. Bill and Melinda Gates or Donald J. Trump) that gives only charitable issues. It is a public charity, such as the United Way or the Salvation Army, that runs its internal projects and employs employees to do the job. The Clinton Foundation &apos; s programmes include providing Peruvian women with the tools and equipment to start their own businesses, installing solar panels and networks in Haiti after the earthquake, helping farmers in Tanzania to increase yields and profit, and using market mechanisms to reduce the cost of HIV/AIDS medicines. He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. By Bill McCarthy: January 12, 2021, together, these programmes cost $68 million in 2013 (p. 10 of the Foundation &apos; s tax documents for that year), or about 80 per cent of all the Foundation &apos; s expenses for that year. In 2014, the programmes accounted for 87 per cent of the Clinton Foundation &apos; s expenditure, according to a Navegator charity, which gave it 10 out of 10 on this scale. Here, a more detailed analysis of the Foundation &apos; s expenses in 2013: In short, Castianos &apos; claim is \"fully wrong,\" as Callahan said, from Poletti Fuckett &apos; s inner charity. \"The vast majority of the money collected goes to support the work of the programme in the field, and anyone can know who to look at the Clinton Foundation's annual finances.\" Castellanos did not respond to the requests for suspension. Our Governor Castillanos said, \"The Clinton Foundation gives less than 10 per cent of direct aid. In 2013, they raised $140 million and gave $9 million to people in direct aid.\" Castillanos selects one piece that does not include all of the foundation &apos; s charity spending. While external grants accounted for about 10 per cent of their expenditure in 2013, the Foundation spent about $68 million, or about 80 per cent, on internal charitable programmes to assist those in need. We assess Castellanos' claim mostly false. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f2b4836b-114e-453b-a297-7ceb2b7159fe", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04369"}
