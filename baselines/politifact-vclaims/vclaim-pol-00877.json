Is that true?", "text": "On his first day in Iowa as a Democratic presidential candidate, Beta O\u2019Rourke heard from a man at a coffee shop who said the teachers in his district need more money. The man said teachers are struggling and paying out-of-pocket for school supplies.\nThings aren\u2019t much better in Texas, said O\u2019Rourke, a former Texas congressman.\n\"Nearly half of public school teachers in Texas are working a second or a third job, not for kicks, not for extra spending cash, but just to make ends meet,\" O\u2019Rourke said March 14 in Keokuk. \"To put food on the table, to buy that medication with a $444 co-pay, just to exist. And at the same time, and the gentlemen said this in his question, out of their own pocket, they are buying supplies for their classroom, supplies for the students in them.\"\nIs O\u2019Rourke right about the number of Texas public school teachers with other jobs? O\u2019Rourke\u2019s claim draws from a voluntary, online survey that\u2019s close on the numbers. But he exaggerates when he suggests it\u2019s certain why teachers take outside work.\nTexas State Teachers Association survey\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign said he relied on survey information from the Texas State Teachers Association. The Texas organization is an affiliate of the National Education Association, a labor union.\n(The Texas group recommended to the National Education Association that it endorse O\u2019Rourke\u2019s 2018 bid for the U.S. Senate. O\u2019Rourke narrowly lost the election to Republican Sen. Ted Cruz.)\nThe Texas organization in August 2018 (at the start of the new school year) said that according to a survey, about four of every 10 teachers expected to take extra jobs outside the classroom \"to meet family expenses.\"\n\"Some 39 percent of TSTA respondents said they needed second jobs during the school year to supplement their school salaries,\" the Texas organization said in August. Fifty-six percent of respondents said they had summer jobs when school was not in session, the group said.\n\"Teacher pay in Texas has been subpar for a long time, and the financial plight of teachers has worsened in recent years because of rising health insurance costs,\" Clay Robison, spokesman for the Texas State Teachers Association, told PolitiFact.\nThe Texas teachers organization did not have a breakdown of how many teachers specifically had second or third jobs to offset financial needs.\nThe average salary of public school teachers in Texas is below the national average. Texas teachers on average got paid $53,167 for the 2017-2018 school year. Nationwide, teachers that school year got paid an average of $60,483\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is no data on why specifically teachers took additional jobs, but it would seem that the overriding reason is to make ends meet, said Dr. Robert Maninger, an associate professor in the School of Teaching and Learning at Sam Houston State University. He\u2019s one of the researchers who conducted the Texas survey. The majority of moonlighting jobs center around the teaching profession, such as tutoring, Maninger said.\nDick Startz, an economics professor at the University of California-Santa Barbara, (not associated with the survey) also told us that he doesn\u2019t think there is much data available on why teachers in general take extra jobs; whether it\u2019s to make ends meet or for extras for the family. He also said he suspected that the Texas survey results might not be representative of all state teachers because those who responded were likely selective.\nResearchers sent a survey link to all members of the Texas teachers organization and members voluntarily responded. There are about 50,000 teachers in the organization; 974 answered the survey.\nIs the survey reflective of all public school teachers in Texas? Texas has about 350,000 public school teachers.\n\"\u2018\u200bReflective of all\u2019 would be impossible, I would think,\" Maninger said. \"Could I generalize our results across the population of teachers in Texas? I think so.\"\nSam Houston State University has been surveying teachers about their pay since 1980, Maninger noted. \"Over the last decade the number of \u2018yes\u2019 answers to moonlighting has been 31 to 44 percent,\" he said.\nIn his February State of the State address, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott declared school finance reform and increasing teacher pay as emergency items. Lawmakers are considering legislation that would give classroom teachers and school librarians an annual pay raise of $5,000.\nMore broadly at a national level, 18 percent of regular, full-time public school teachers reported having a job outside the school system to supplement their income, the U.S. Department of Education said in a June 2018 report that draws from the 2015\u201316 National Teacher and Principal Survey.\nRegionally, 17 percent of teachers in the South had a job outside their school system. (The South region included Texas, the District of Columbia, and 15 other states.) The Department of Education said its data was based on a nationally representative sample survey of public K\u201312 schools, principals, and teachers in the 50 states and the District of Columbia.\nOur ruling\nO\u2019Rourke said, \"Nearly half of public school teachers in Texas are working a second or a third job, not for kicks, not for extra spending cash, but just to make ends meet.\"\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s claim is based on responses to a voluntary, online survey sent to about 50,000 Texas public school teachers. Respondents were self-selected. Close to 1,000 responded. Thirty-nine percent said they needed second jobs during the school year, and 56 percent said they had summer jobs when school was not in session.\nOn average, public school teachers get paid less in Texas than nationally. But researchers say there is limited information on why teachers take additional jobs. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s claim makes it sound as if paying for basic necessities is the only reason why teachers take extra jobs. That might be the case for some teachers, but we don\u2019t know if it is the driving factor for all of them.\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details.
