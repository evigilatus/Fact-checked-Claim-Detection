Scott Walker\u2019s jobs strategy, saying the Republican governor \"generally believes that you give tax breaks to those at the top and the special interests and somehow it trickles down and creates jobs.\"\n\"Well, I\u2019m a business person. That\u2019s not how jobs get created,\" countered Burke, who formerly served as a Trek Bicycle Corp. executive and state Commerce secretary.\n\"So, it\u2019s a flawed model and I have a very different model and I lay out in my jobs plan the five core strategies on how we\u2019re going to do this,\" Burke continued, before making a claim we want to check.\n\"It means we need to have a more entrepreneurial climate in Wisconsin. That\u2019s one of them (her five strategies). Right now, we\u2019re 46th in the country in terms of new businesses started.\"\nJust the other day, we rated True a Walker claim that Wisconsin ranks 11th \"in total business establishment growth,\" compared with 47th in the years that Burke was Commerce secretary.\nSo we wondered whether Burke\u2019s claim contradicts that.\nAs we\u2019ll see, terminology is key.\nDifferent measures\nWalker referred to \"business establishments,\" a term that means a business location, such as a new store or factory or farm. A single company can have multiple \"establishments,\" and new \"establishments\" can be opened by existing or new firms. So it\u2019s a particular measure.\nBurke\u2019s terminology is different than Walker\u2019s, and refers to a different measuring stick.\nIn October 2013, days after announcing her candidacy for governor, Burke said Wisconsin was 49th in the United States in \"new businesses created.\" We rated her statement Mostly True.\nBurke cited the Kauffman Index of Entrepreneurial Activity, an annual study produced by the nonpartisan Kauffman Foundation, a Kansas City-based group that works to foster entrepreneurial activity.\nBusiness administration professor Stewart Thornhill, executive director of the Institute for Entrepreneurial Studies at the University of Michigan, told us it is a widely cited measure.\nThe index uses U.S. Census data to capture the number of new business owners in their first month of significant business activity.\nIn Kauffman\u2019s 2013 index, Wisconsin tied with Michigan for 48th among the states in the number of entrepreneurs per 100,000 people, ahead of only Nebraska and Minnesota.\nSo, what\u2019s the landscape now?\nBurke\u2019s evidence\nTo back Burke\u2019s new claim, her campaign cited the 2014 Kauffman index. Here are the states rated lowest in terms of new business owners in their first month of significant business activity:\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nRank/State\n\n\nEntrepreneurs per 100,000 people\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. average\n\n\n280\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(tie) Wisconsin and Washington\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n170\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(tie) Minnesota and Indiana\n\n\n\n\n160\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRhode Island\n\n\n\n\n140\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIowa\n\n\n\n\n110\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nSo, Wisconsin is actually one notch higher than Burke indicated.\nOn one hand, tying for 45th is an improvement from 48th in the 2013 index.\nOn the other hand, Wisconsin\u2019s 2014 rate of 170 entrepreneurs per 100,000 people is actually lower than its 2013 rate of 180.\n(Montana ranked first in both 2013 and 2014. Its 2014 rate was 610 entrepreneurs per 100,000 people.)\nWalker\u2019s response\nWalker campaign spokeswoman Alleigh Marre\u0301 pointed out that in our earlier Burke factcheck, the Kauffman Foundation warned that its index isn\u2019t meant to provide a precise ranking of states. But its report in effect does that by reporting precise ratings and singling out states in the top five highest and lowest groups.\nMarre\u0301 also cited other business-creation statistics, including the Walker claim about total business establishment growth.\nBut, again, that is a different measure than the one Burke cites.\nOur rating\nBurke said Wisconsin is \"46th in the country in terms of new businesses started.\"\nWisconsin actually ties for 45th in the well-known Kauffman index, in terms of new business owners in their first month of significant business activity.\nWe rate the statement Mostly True.\nTo comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\u2019s web page.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07237"}
