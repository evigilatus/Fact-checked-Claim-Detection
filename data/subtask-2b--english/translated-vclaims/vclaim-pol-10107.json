What we said was to change those testimonies. The First Lady has done a great job with an organization called the Forces d'Accordings, bringing the veterans back to work. As a result, the unemployment of veterans is now lower than that of the general population. It was higher when I came to office.\" We wondered if Obama had the right statistics. We looked into the data on the employment of ex-combatants collected by the Office of Labour Statistics. We focused on two categories of veterans - all veterans, as well as those who served specifically on 11 September 2011, the armed forces. While Obama did not specify which type of veterans he was referring to, the context indicates that he was referring to veterans after 9/11. :: Unemployment rate statistics for all ex-combatants, January 2009: 7.4 per cent. Unemployment rate for the general population, January 2009: 7.8 per cent. Obama said that unemployment among ex-combatants was higher than the general population when he took office and was therefore mistaken for this measure. :: Unemployment rate for all ex-combatants, September 2012: 6.7 per cent unemployment rate for the general population, September 2012: 7.8 per cent Obama said that unemployment among ex-combatants was now lower than that of the general population, so as a measure, he was right. :: Veterans &apos; statistics after 9/11 only. Unemployment rate for Veterans after 9/11. January 2009: 8.9%. Unemployment rate for the general population. January 2009: 7.8%. Obama said that unemployment among Veterans was higher than the general population when he took office. :: Unemployment rate for veterans after 9/11, September 2012: 9.7%. Unemployment rate for the general population, September 2012: 7.8%. Obama said that unemployment among veterans is now lower than that of the general population. So, whatever scale you use, Obama's formulation was half correct. We should also note that, as we have done in the past, Presidents do not necessarily have a significant impact either on high or low unemployment, because the country's labour market is large and dynamic enough to be shaped by multiple factors that go beyond mere presidential policies. However, presidential policies may have a greater impact on the employment of veterans than other types of workers, as the Veterans &apos; Department and other agencies have specific policies aimed at promoting the employment of veterans. Our Governor Obama said: \"The unemployment of veterans is now less than the general population. It was higher when I came to office.\" Whether you're talking about all the veterans or only those who served after September 11, Obama gets the number one right but the number one wrong. So we evaluate his claim half right. On January 13, 2021, the distinguished fact-finding bloggers announced in a story in which General David H. Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for the use of marines for inaugural security, saying, \"We are not working for you.\"", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10107"}
