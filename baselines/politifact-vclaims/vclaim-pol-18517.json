The map shows North Carolina in the Trump column, while other battleground states \u2014 Arizona, Wisconsin, Michigan, Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania \u2014 are labeled as having \"incomplete or contested results.\"\n\"The real electoral map...... before the lying media called it for Biden,\" the caption says.\n\n(Screenshot from Facebook)\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Similar claims have spread in groups dedicated to the Stop the Steal movement, which took off after Election Day and has spread misinformation about voter fraud.\nWe\u2019ve seen several inaccurate and misleading electoral maps that make it seem like Trump was leading Biden in electoral votes. This one is similarly wrong.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.

As of Nov. 11, the website said the election outcome is \"unclear\" and that it \"will not declare a winner of the election until all results are certified and any legal challenges are resolved.\"\nStates have until Dec. 8 to finalize their results. State electors cast their ballots Dec. 14, but the vote will not be made official until Jan. 6, when Congress tallies the electoral votes.\nBut Biden is the clear winner, as he received more votes than Trump in battleground states like Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, which helped put him over the 270 electoral vote threshold for election. Every major TV network and the Associated Press has projected that Biden won the election.\nIn Pennsylvania, the former vice president led by more than 50,000 votes. It\u2019s unlikely that the Trump campaign\u2019s legal challenges in the state will make up that gap.\nSo where does the electoral map stand?\u00a0\nAs of Nov. 12, Biden was projected to win 290 electoral votes \u2014\u00a020 more than he needs to win the White House \u2014 while Trump is expected to win 217. The AP hasn\u2019t called North Carolina or Georgia for either candidate.\nThe Facebook post is inaccurate. We rate it False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18517"}
