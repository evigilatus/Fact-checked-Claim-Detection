The records examine general elections going back to 1999 and show the number of uncontested statehouse elections.\nAll seats in the 100-member House are up for grabs every two years. Cote accurately noted that in the last eight elections, an average of 49.75 seats House seats were uncontested. That would be in line with Sarvis\u2019 proclamation that more than 40 House of Delegates seats are one-candidate elections.\nAll seats in the 40-member Senate are up every four years. And Cote correctly noted that an average of 17.25 Senate seats were uncontested in the last four elections. That\u2019s an average of 43 percent per election, Cote said, consistent with Sarvis\u2019 claim.\nBut Sarvis didn\u2019t phrase his statement as an average. He said \"every year\" more than 40 percent of the seats in each chamber weren\u2019t contested. So we have to look at each election year individually.\nHere are the number of uncontested seats in biennial House elections since 1999, according to returns from the state Board of Elections:\n\n\n2013 -- 45\n\n\n2011 -- 63\n\n\n2009 -- 31\n\n\n2007 -- 59\n\n\n2005 -- 51\n\n\n2003 -- 61\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2001 -- 40\n\n\n1999 -- 48\n\n\nSarvis\u2019 claim that \"over\" 40 seats went uncontested each cycle doesn\u2019t hold up for 2009\u00a0and -- because it\u2019s our job to be sticklers -- in 2001.\nHere are the number of uncontested seats in quadrennial Senate elections since 1999:\n\n\n2011 -- 14\n\n\n2007 -- 17\n\n\n2003 -- 19\n\n\n1999 -- 19\n\n\nRemember, the Senate has 40 members. Sarvis\u2019 claim that more than 40 percent of the seats went uncontested each cycle sputters in the latest election, in 2011, when 35 percent the races had no competition.\nVirginia\u2019s not the only place where a significant percentage of state legislature races go uncontested each election year.\nAn October 2012 study from the College of William and Mary found that 39.7 percent of the 6,000 statehouse races across the country that year lacked competition between major party candidates.\nThe study examined the 44 states that had legislative races that year. Virginia wasn\u2019t included because it holds General Assembly races in odd-numbered years.\nThe study said legislative redistricting -- in which lawmakers draw election maps and usually fashion safe districts for themselves -- discouraged competition for statehouse seats. That would carry over to Virginia, where lawmakers control redistricting, according to John J. McGlennon, a professor of government at the College of William and Mary who co-authored the report.\nMcGlennon said another factor deterring competition is that Virginia\u2019s statehouse races occur in years when there are no presidential or congressional races. That means down-ballot candidates for the state legislature can\u2019t ride a coattail effect into office, he said.\nOur ruling\nSarvis said \"every year\" more than 40 percent of House and Senate seats have only one candidate.\nElection figures generally back Sarvis. The only blip is that during a few years -- 2011 for the Senate, as well as 2009 and 2001 for the House -- the number of uncontested races didn\u2019t quite hit the threshold Sarvis cited.\nHis point is basically correct but could use some additional information.
