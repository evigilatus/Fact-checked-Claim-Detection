They didn't know she was a representative of the Russian government, and indeed, she's not a representative of the Russian government. So, this is much ado about nothing.\n\"I don't even know if they knew she was Russian at the time,\" Giuliani added during the Aug. 19 interview.\nGiuliani\u2019s claim is starkly at odds with the facts.\n'Russian government attorney'\nEmails between Donald Trump\u00a0Jr., and his father\u2019s business associate \u2014 emails that the younger Trump himself published on Twitter \u2014 directly contradict Giuliani\u2019s assertion.\nHere's my statement and the full email chain pic.twitter.com/x050r5n5LQ\u2014 Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) July 11, 2017 \nOn June 3, 2016, Donald Trump Jr. received an email from Rob Goldstone, a business associate of Trump senior. Their correspondence set in motion the Trump Tower meeting that would take place six days later.\nIn emails, Goldstone told the younger Trump that Moscow supported his father\u2019s candidacy, and that a Russian government official could pass on incriminating evidence against Clinton.\n\"The Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary (Clinton) and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father,\" Goldstone wrote.\n\"This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government\u2019s support for Mr. Trump,\" he added, noting that a \"Russian government attorney\" would be willing to meet with Trump\u00a0Jr.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe younger Trump replied: \"If it\u2019s what you say I love it.\"\nTrump Jr. forwarded the email chain to then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and the elder Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner.\nDays later, on June 9, Trump Jr. and\u00a0campaign members met with a Russian national and several others.
