Paul Ryan\u2019s budget proposal would eliminate Medicare in 10 years", "text": "Addressing donors to President Barack Obama\u2019s re-election campaign at a fundraiser, Vice President Joe Biden described stark choices for voters in 2012.\n\nHe painted Obama as a strong leader, gutsy enough to order a covert raid on Osama bin Laden\u2019s compound and to try for a big deal on debt reduction.\n\nIn contrast, he said Republicans are headed the wrong direction on Medicare under the reform plan authored by Wisconsin Republican Paul Ryan, chairman of the House Budget Committee.\n\n\"These guys have laid it out where they want us to be,\" Biden told attendees at the event in Tulsa, Okla., on Aug. 30, 2011. \"Paul Ryan laid out their budget. Their budget eviscerates -- it eliminates Medicare. They say it doesn't. It makes it a voucher program. I call that eliminating Medicare in the next 10 years.\"\n\nThe remarks -- reported in part on the ABC News website -- echo multiple Democratic attacks on aspects of Ryan\u2019s deficit-cutting 10-year \"Path to Prosperity plan. That resolution was passed in the GOP-controlled House\u00a0 in April 2011 but rejected by the Democrat-controlled Senate a month later.\n\nPolitiFact has not looked favorably on the accuracy of the Democratic charges on Ryan\u2019s proposed transformation of Medicare, which he says is aimed at reducing massive federal deficits and debt.\n\nFor example, the national site rated Pants on Fire a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee claim that \"seniors will have to find $12,500 for health care because Republicans voted to end Medicare.\"\n\nAnd we rated False a Move.On.org email claim that the House Republican budget \"abolishes Medicare within 10 years.\"\n\nSo how do Biden\u2019s comments fare?\n\nBiden minced no words, saying the GOP path \"eviscerates\" -- that is, guts -- the health care program for the elderly. Then he went further, saying it would be \"eliminated\" in 10 years.\n\nThere is significance to the 10-year mark.\n\nThe GOP proposal would, as the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office noted, gradually convert the current Medicare program to a system under which beneficiaries received premium support payments that can be used to help pay for a private health insurance policy.\n\nBeginning in 2022, \"all newly-eligible Medicare beneficiaries...would only have access to health coverage through private insurance plans, rather than through the current government-run Medicare program (i.e., traditional Medicare), or under a Medicare Advantage plan,\" a Kaiser Family Foundation study noted.\n\nThat\u2019s a fundamental switch.\n\nMedicare would \"no longer provide coverage for medical care, but instead provide a \"subsidy\" toward the purchase of a private health insurance plan,\" the Kaiser study said.\n\nThe CBO found that the change would save the government money. But it does so by asking future Medicare beneficiaries to pay more for current levels of coverage, PolitiFact has reported from the CBO report.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note, the GOP resolution specifically exempts existing beneficiaries and future beneficiaries who are currently 55 and over.\n\nThe vice president\u2019s office gave us its view on Biden\u2019s remarks.\n\nMedicare is a \"system of guaranteed affordable health insurance for seniors. Preserving Medicare in its current form is a core Democratic value,\" the office said in an email.\n\n\"If you replace the current system with vouchers, or premium support payments, then you are eliminating the principle of guaranteed affordable insurance and thus eliminating Medicare as we know it.\"\n\nThose last four words are very important -- and were missing from the original statement, the one that got the attention and that we are rating.\n\nOur ruling:\n\nBiden says Ryan\u2019s plan \"eliminates Medicare\" in 10 years. In stating it that way in front of campaign donors, he strays from the \"as we know it\" qualifier even the president has used.\n\nThe bottom line is that all seniors would continue to be offered coverage under the proposal, and the program\u2019s budget would increase every year. The plan would reduce the growth in Medicare spending but not wipe out that spending. And current beneficiaries and those currently 55 and over would not be affected by the changes. It changes Medicare, dramatically, but does not eliminate it.\n\nWe rate Biden\u2019s statement False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-12462"}
