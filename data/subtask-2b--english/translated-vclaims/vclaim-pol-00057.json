This is a reaffirmation in the ongoing debate on the costs of health care, and the debate on the role of health care in American finances. Instead of focusing on non-insurance, Warren interferes with the question of whether insurance is currently sufficient. But much of the research on medical debt and bankruptcy is controversial - especially Warren's own work. We decided to take a deeper look. According to research, Warren's campaign directed us to the research published in 2009 in the American Journal of Medicine. It was co-authored by Warren, and a random sample of 2,314 filers was viewed as bankrupt from 2007. The paper examined what debtors reported their bankruptcy. Warren here refers to people who either mentioned a large direct medical debt, re-consumption of a home to pay a medical debt, or loss of income due to illness. In this category, more than two thirds of households have health insurance - in fact, three quarters have health insurance. So from a simple point of view, the number is checked. The argument is not necessarily that simple. This specific paper has long been the subject of controversy. This is partly because it focuses on people who have declared themselves bankrupt, rather than looking at the financial impact of medical debt in general. On January 14, 2021, Chuck Grasley stated in a tweet that insulin prices had \"lost the RoOOF for patients/taxpayers bc from the manufacturer, a health plan and PBM Biz practices.\" \u2022 On February 2, 2021, researchers also quickly noted that in the majority of the so-called \"medical bankruptcy\" specified in the paper, the issue was not debts incurred to pay health-care bills. But the biggest problem is lost income because people can't work. This has fuelled a long period of bankruptcy, especially as regards whether this paper is actually useful in determining the role that medical debt plays in feeding bankruptcy cases. However, its impact on this specific allegation is not so clear. Because Warren narrowed her statement, and focused on something less controversial. First, the paper is clear in finding that two thirds of families - even more so - suffered from bankruptcy after a medical problem even though they had health insurance. Paul Jensburg, an economist in health and professor at the University of Southern California, said. (Jinsburg also noted the importance of lost income in paying for bankruptcy, rather than medical costs. And Warren tied him up even more during the debate, limiting these statistics to what was found \"when she was studying it\" - making it less overwhelming. What is more suspicious is whether this result - even if accurate - supports its following point: it is the cost of health care that drives people to financial problems, and a generous one-time plan would improve this issue. For example, \"You can't move from that result to the conclusion that we need medical care for everyone,\" said Jensburg. Health insurance is more generous today than it was when Warren studied it, thanks to the Affordable Care Act. Insuring everyone - even if generously suggested by medical care for all - will not necessarily address the issue of lost income when people are sick, which research suggests is a greater financial concern. Warren's claim comes from a controversial paper, which calls into question its methods and interpretation. However, these statistics are rather specific, and their formulation in the prosecution is accurate. It is in itself a fair reflection of what the newspaper says. Where caution is more important: Warren states that this conclusion indicates that the cost of health care is the cause of financial damage to Americans. This does not necessarily prove, and requires further scrutiny. This statement is accurate but will benefit from further information. We're mostly assessing it right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00057"}
