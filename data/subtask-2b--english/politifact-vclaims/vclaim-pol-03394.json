House Bill 228 is the General Assembly\u2019s\u00a0third attempt in the past four legislative sessions\u00a0to offer unemployment benefits on a sliding scale. If passed, the bill would link the amount of weeks a person could receive unemployment benefits to the state\u2019s unemployment rate.\nCurrently, Missouri offers up to 20 weeks of unemployment benefits.\u00a0The bill proposes\u00a0that when Missouri has a low unemployment rate \u2014 6 percent or lower \u2014 benefits would be available for only 13 weeks. As the rate increases, so do the benefits. At most, people could collect up to 20 weeks of benefits if the unemployment rate is 9 percent or higher.\n\n\nSupporters said the bill will ensure the state does not deplete the state\u2019s unemployment trust fund, which is how Missouri saves money for unemployment benefits during recessions. When the fund reaches zero, the state must borrow money from the federal government, which involves paying high interest rates.\u00a0Employers pay separate taxes\u00a0to fund both\u00a0the state\u00a0and federal unemployment trust fund.\n\n\nThe bill\u2019s fiscal notes\u00a0report it could save the state\u2019s unemployment fund up to $82 million per year. The House passed HB 288 on February 23, and it now awaits a vote in the Senate.\n\n\nIn the days after the House voted, Rep. Allen Andrews, R-Grant City, was quoted about the bill\u00a0in an article on KMA Land, a website produced by a radio news station based in Shenandoah, Iowa. Andrews said, \"Missouri is actually the only state that has been forced to borrow money from the federal government to pay for unemployment benefits during each of the last five economic downturns.\n\n\nThis\u00a0isn\u2019t the only\u00a0time\u00a0Andrews has stated this.\u00a0A fewlegislators\u00a0and the\u00a0Missouri Chamber of Commerce\u00a0have repeated the statement as well. So we wanted to check it out.\n\n\nMissouri borrowing\n\n\nAndrews never answered PolitiFact\u2019s many emails and calls, so we went to find the data on our own.\n\n\nAccording to the\u00a0National Bureau of Economic Research, the last five recessions were\n> December 2007 to June 2009\n> March 2001 to November 2001\n> July 1990 to March 1991\n> July 1981 to November 1982\n> January 1980 to July 1980:\n\u00a0\n\n\nTo find out whether Missouri borrowed a Federal Title XII loan to pay for unemployment benefits deficits during those time periods, we went to the\u00a0U.S. Department of Labor.\n\n\nThe data showed that at year\u2019s end of the following years, Missouri had borrowed money to fully fund unemployment benefits claims:\n> 2009-2013\n> 2003-2006\n> 1993\n> 1983\n> 1982\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThese year years don\u2019t exactly match up with the recessions \u2014\u00a0Missouri borrows just after the recessions\u2019 end dates \u2014\u00a0but that\u2019s normal, said Robert Pavosevich, lead actuary for the U.S. Department of Labor. States usually take out loans at the end of a recession, not in the middle, when unemployment remains high, he said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, Pavosevich said that using the strict definition of a recession \"wouldn\u2019t be fair.\"\n\n\n\"When people talk about recession, generally they\u2019re talking about when unemployment is high, not the official date,\" he said. \"(Andrews) probably meant the time period overall.\"\n\n\nSo far, Andrews is correct: Missouri has borrowed money from the federal government in the last five recessions to make up for deficits in its unemployment trust fund \u2014\u00a0but is it the only state to do so?\n\n\nThe only state\n\n\nA review of data on borrowing by the other 49 states along with Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands confirms that Missouri is indeed the only state to receive a loan from the federal government for the unemployment trust fund during the past five economic downturns.\n\n\nThere are five close contenders that borrowed during four of the five recessions: Neither Michigan nor Connecticut borrowed for the 2001 recession, while Minnesota, Texas and Illinois didn\u2019t borrow for the 1990-91 recession.\n\n\nPavosevich said there were two other ways that could invalidate Andrews\u2019 claim. States could have borrowed and paid back a loan within a year, which wouldn\u2019t have been represented on the data available on the department\u2019s website. Additionally, several states use private borrowing to pay back the Title XII loan to the government by selling state bonds to the private market; these states have outstanding loans for unemployment benefits but not to the government.\n\n\nPavosevich looked into the data, which isn\u2019t publicly available, for these two caveats \u2014\u00a0paying the Title XII loan within the year and private borrowing \u2014\u00a0and found that Missouri is the only state to to have taken out a loan during or right after each of the last five recession.\n\n\n\"(It) appears that the statement is true if you consider recessionary periods rather broadly,\" Pavosevich concluded in an email.\n\n\nOur ruling\n\n\nAndrews said, \"Missouri is actually the only state that has been forced to borrow money from the federal government to pay for unemployment benefits during each of the last five economic downturns.\"\n\n\nAccording to the data from the U.S. Department of Labor, not only did Missouri take out loans from the federal government to pay for unemployment benefits during economic downturns, but also it is the only state to do so.\nWe rate this claim as True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03394"}
