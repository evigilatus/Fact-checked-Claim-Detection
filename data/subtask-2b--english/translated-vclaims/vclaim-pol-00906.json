Specifically, education in public schools. In his 2018 campaign for the Governor, democracy promised to phase out or cancel private school vouchers -- mainly tax-funded scholarships that allow students to attend private schools. On February 19, 2019, Evers told journalist Mike Gosha during an event \"On Issues\" at the Faculty of Law of the University of Marquette that the move to cancel coupons would not come in his first budget. Instead, the budget would focus on greater transparency and accountability within programmes. This is what was said in the exchange with Gosha: \"In terms of phasing out private voucher schools, this is not part of this budget you're going to be presenting next week?\" \"Hung up\"? No.\" However, when the Evers budget was released, it included provisions to phase out at least part of the voucher programme. We turn again to our O-Meter prank, which measures whether the politician is consistent on an issue. In this case, we want to see if Evers was consistent with not phasing out vouchers in his first budget. In a questionnaire submitted by the Wisconsin School Managers Alliance to the Governor &apos; s candidates in 2018, Evers said that he supported greater transparency about vouchers and would work with the state legislature to end the programme. More specifically, during the campaign, Evers promised to freeze registration in all four school voucher programmes - Milouki, Rasin, the state-wide programme, and the Special Needs Scholarship Programme - and eventually phase out them. The school voucher programme in Milwaukee began and was in existence for nearly 30 years. The Racine programme came in 2011, followed by the rest of the state in 2013 and 2014. The program allows parents to send their children to private schools, with a voucher funded by taxpayers, rather than public schools. Families must meet certain income limits in order to qualify for vouchers and file their applications again each year. The Special Needs Scholarship Programme, which began in 2015, is the only programme that needs no income. The programme allows parents of children with disabilities to send their children to a private school. The bill states that Jim Steinke verified the facts on January 26, 2021 on Republican Twitter \"come to the table\" and were part of the \"giving and taking\" compromise on the Corona virus bill. In 2019, Assembly Bill 56 - the budget of Evers, now before the Joint Finance Committee of the Legislature - has several aspects involved in the voucher programme. For example, the budget would limit the number of participants in the programmes, ensure that teachers in the schools participating in the programme receive a State licence or permit, and require that schools be accredited to participate by 1 August 2019. However, some of the changes being made to the special needs scholarship programme seem to run counter to the Governor &apos; s position that he is not phasing out education vouchers in this budget. On page 17, the budget states that, starting from the 2020-21 school year, the State will not grant a study grant with special needs to the child to attend a private school unless he or she has attended a private school in the 2019-20 school year. Furthermore, if the child does not attend a special school under a special needs scholarship in any school year after the current enrolment year, the Department of Public Information will not provide scholarships for the child for any year thereafter. This certainly seems to be the beginning of the end of scholarships for the special needs of special schools. In other words, it is beginning to be phased out. Melissa Balduff, Director of Communications at Evers, said that the proposed changes in the special needs programme should not be seen as a gradual termination. Rather, it represented the completion of the expansion of voucher programmes. She noted that the special needs programme had not been launched until 2015. She said, \"It was a major expansion of school coupons.\" \"We don't finish it. What we say is that we will no longer grow unsustainable because taxpayers cannot afford to finance two separate educational systems. Fair enough. But in our view the language is clear -- it says that no new students will be admitted to the program. As such, the programme - year after year - will be smaller until it is finished. Our evaluation of Evers promised the campaign the phasing out of school voucher programmes and increased funding for general education. In his appearance at the University of Marquette, he would not begin to phase it out in his first budget. However, once the budget had been issued, it was clear that he wanted to phase out at least part of the programme - the part for students with special needs. In order to partially change the location, we give Evers half of Flip.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00906"}
