Its claim came immediately after a doubling of the Illinois tax to 38 cents per gallon, part of the Government. The infrastructure improvement plan is $45 billion. Revenue from tax hikes is allocated to repair roads and bridges throughout the state. Following the entry into force of the new tax, news reports reported that some residents were crossing the state border to save a few dollars by filling their tanks in Indiana. Two weeks ago, the host of Ben Juravsky in Chicago Suntime asked Mendoza, a democracy and a firm supporter of many of Britzker's initiatives, about this new phenomenon. Mendoza did not vote for the tax hike but expressed support for it. \"India actually has a higher gas tax than Illinois does even with an increase in taxes,\" said Mendoza in response. We were only paying 19 cents to the gallon of taxes here in Illinois on the gas tax while Indiana was paying 43 cents to the gallon for the gas tax. So our share, even 38 cents, is still less than Indiana's pay today.\" Either driving to Indiana for gasoline is a futile and expensive attempt, or Mendoza has performed a statistically gymnastic achievement to defend a controversial tax increase that I have ratified. So, we decided to check the numbers. According to the Illinois Revenue Department, the Illinois car fuel tax rate was set at 38 cents per gallon from 1 July 2019 to 30 June 2020. This rate increased from 19 cents per gallon, which has been imposed by the State on gasoline since 1990. Indiana &apos; s gasoline tax is 30 cents per gallon, after a penny increase came into effect on July 1. According to the spokesman for Mendoza, Abdon Balach, the Controller was given figures collected from outdated articles that participated in the results of a 2018 report by the American Petroleum Institute, which collected all the taxes and fees of car fuel according to the State, rather than just production taxes. Based on these results, government taxes and fees on gasoline in Indiana totalled 42.9 cents per gallon, compared with 37.32 cents per gallon here in Illinois in July 2018. However, the updated figures for the 2019 American Energy Initiative show that the total gas taxes and fees in Illinois are 54.98 cents per gallon, and the total taxes and fees in Indiana are 46.62 cents per gallon. With this measure, there are clear taxes on gasoline at higher levels in Illinois. In 2017, under the Tax Act of 2017, \"taxes will be raised on people who earn less than $75,000 in 2021 and every two years thereafter until 2027.\" By Louis Jacobson on February 5, 2021, Balash admitted that Mendoza's office had mistakenly used 37.32 cents of the Illinois statistical gallon, although it represented an outdated figure last year. This led to an erroneous analysis in which Mendoza compared the new tax on Illinois-produced gasoline with an old figure for the total amount of taxes and charges on gasoline in Indiana. \"After the show (Ben Guravsky) I came back and looked at the numbers and realized they were an inaccurate comparison,\" said Balach. \"I used a comparison of apples to oranges.\" These totals of taxes and fees broken down by the interest rate index consist of a few different elements in each state. For Indiana, the 46.62 cents per gallon includes the State gas production tax, the monthly gas use tax calculated according to the average price of a gallon of gas (15.6 cents per gallon in July 2019), and the oil inspection fee of 1 per cent per gallon. In Illinois, the total number adds a government sales tax of about 15 cents per gallon, nominal underground storage fees and environmental effects to the new 38 cents production tax. In addition, many cities and provinces around Illinois impose additional sales taxes on gasoline. For example, the people of Chicago have to pay the Cook County Sales Tax at 1.75 per cent and the City Sales Tax at 1.25 per cent, both of which are 6.25 per cent higher than the state sales tax rate. In the end, state and local taxes on gasoline exceed 60 cents per gallon in Chicago. On the other hand, according to the Indiana Revenue Department and other government finance experts, there are no direct domestic taxes on gasoline anywhere in Indiana. This makes total gas taxes and fees about 46 cents per gallon throughout the state, at least a few cents per gallon less than any Illinois region. The population of Illinois also pays more for gasoline than the population of Indiana. At the Mobile Station in the city of Calumet, it currently costs $3.45 a gallon. Two miles from the road in Hammond, the price of gasoline is $2.99 per gallon. Mendoza compared two different statistical categories. Her number for Illinois represents only the government gas tax, while its number for Indiana includes all government gas taxes and charges. \"When you use 43 cents per gallon, you include a State sales tax on gasoline, and if you want to do so for Indiana, you also have to do so for Illinois, which raises the Illinois tax, when you include that portion of the tax, to approximately 55 cents,\" said Richard Oxer, Urban Tax Policy Centre Research Assistant - Brookings. \"If you're doing the exact comparison, the Illinois rate is higher.\" Our judgment, Mendoza, said Indiana had a higher gas tax than Illinois even after a recent picnic. With every government measure we've examined, and with the confirmation of Mendoza's own office, the allegation is wrong. The population of Illinois pays eight cents in government production taxes for each gallon of gasoline more than the population of Indiana, according to revenue officials in both states. We appreciate Mendoza's false claim. It's wrong that the phrase isn't accurate.
