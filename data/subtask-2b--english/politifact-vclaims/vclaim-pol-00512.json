Well, at least that\u2019s what one post recently shared on Facebook claims.\nFeaturing a photo of Hackman, the post attributes the following quote to the actor: \"Donald Trump could easily turn out to be one of the best presidents that America has ever seen.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nNope. Hackman didn\u2019t say that. The quote is an incomplete version of something said by the late Peter Stringfellow, an English businessman who owned several nightclubs.\nWe traced the misattribution to the junk website coolinfo24.com, which posted a now-deleted, incoherent article in November 2018 with the headline: \"HOLLYWOOD LEGEND GENE HACKMAN: \u2018DONALD TRUMP COULD EASILY TURN OUT TO BE ONE OF THE BEST PRESIDENTS THAT AMERICA HAS EVER SEEN.\u2019\"\nThe article claimed that while Hackman was being interviewed \"not long ago,\" he spoke about meeting Trump in the 1980s at a party Hackman threw in New York.\nEventually, the post states that Hackman said he was shocked when he first heard Trump was to be the Republican nominee, but after a \"year\" of his presidency said:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So what do I think about Trump now?

It belongs to late English nightclub owner Peter Stringfellow, and the quote was \u00a0cut short, omitting that Stringfellow also said, \"or one of the worst!\"\nWe rate this claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00512"}
