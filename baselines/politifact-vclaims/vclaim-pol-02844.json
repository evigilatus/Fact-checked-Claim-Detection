Luther Strange, R-Ala., in a Sept. 26\u00a0runoff election was a blow for President Donald Trump, who had endorsed Strange over his Republican rival Roy Moore. Strange\u2019s loss even led Trump to delete several of his pro-Strange tweets shortly after the election.\nBut Trump didn\u2019t drop the subject, tweeting a few days later, \"In analyzing the Alabama Primary race, FAKE NEWS always fails to mention that the candidate I endorsed went up MANY points after endorsement!\"\nIn analyzing the Alabama Primary race,FAKE NEWS always fails to mention that the candidate I endorsed went up MANY points after endorsement!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2017\n\nWhen we took a closer look, we found weak support for Trump\u2019s claim.\nThe White House pointed us to a news release from Emerson College\u2019s polling unit, which conducted several polls of the Alabama contest.\nThe news release announcing the results of the Emerson poll conducted Sept. 21-23 included the following analysis: \"Moore still leads Strange 50 percent to 40 percent, but the gap has narrowed. Strange trailed Moore by 14 points two weeks ago in Emerson\u2019s previous Alabama poll \u2026 President Trump\u2019s ardent support of Luther Strange in the recent weeks is the likely cause of the gap closing.\" (Trump\u2019s rally in support of Strange was held on the evening of Sept. 22, meaning a portion of the survey occurred after that event.)\nThe lines from the news release don\u2019t provide as much support as Trump seems to think they do.\nFor starters, there\u2019s some question whether a four-point gain merits the label \"MANY\" -- or whether it\u2019s even mathematically significant, given that the poll had a five-point margin of error.\nThere are also questions about the timing. The Sept. 22 rally for Strange wasn\u2019t actually the unveiling of Trump\u2019s endorsement -- it had been public for weeks. Trump officially endorsed Strange on Aug. 8, a point Trump glossed over in his tweet. In other words, voters who had been paying attention during either the Aug. 15 primary (which included three major Republican candidates) and the Sept. 26 runoff (which included just Moore and Strange) would have known that Strange was Trump\u2019s endorsed candidate.\nFinally, focusing solely on the Emerson poll leaves out a lot of other polling data that showed little movement toward Strange after either Trump\u2019s formal endorsement or his rally.\nHere\u2019s a rundown of polls from the RealClearPolitics.com archive:\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPoll\n\n\nDates\n\n\nMoore\n\n\nStrange\n\n\nLeader in poll\n\n\n\n\nPrimary polls\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nWBRC-TV/\nStrategy Research\n\n\n7/24 - 7/24\n\n\n33\n\n\n35\n\n\nStrange +2\n\n\n\n\nRRH/PMI (R)\n\n\n7/31 - 8/3\n\n\n31\n\n\n29\n\n\nMoore +2\n\n\n\n\nJMC Analytics\n\n\n8/5 - 8/6\n\n\n30\n\n\n22\n\n\nMoore +8\n\n\n\n\nTrump endorsement\n\n\n8/8\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nTrafalgar Group (R)\n\n\n8/8 - 8/10\n\n\n35\n\n\n23\n\n\nMoore +12\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmerson\n\n\n8/10 - 8/12\n\n\n29\n\n\n32\n\n\nStrange +3\n\n\n\n\nTrafalgar Group (R)\n\n\n8/12 - 8/13\n\n\n38\n\n\n24\n\n\nMoore +15\n\n\n\n\nRunoff polls\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nEmerson\n\n\n9/8 - 9/9\n\n\n40\n\n\n26\n\n\nMoore +14\n\n\n\n\nGravis\n\n\n9/21 - 9/22\n\n\n48\n\n\n40\n\n\nMoore +8\n\n\n\n\nTrump rally for Strange in Alabama\n\n\n9/22\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nEmerson\n\n\n9/21 - 9/23\n\n\n50\n\n\n40\n\n\nMoore +10\n\n\n\n\n0ptimus\n\n\n9/22 - 9/23\n\n\n55\n\n\n45\n\n\nMoore +10\n\n\n\n\nTrafalgar Group (R)\n\n\n9/23 - 9/24\n\n\n57\n\n\n41\n\n\nMoore +16\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThese 11 polls show little convincing evidence that Trump\u2019s official endorsement or his rally moved the needle for Strange.\nOne Emerson poll, taken just after Trump\u2019s official endorsement from Aug. 10 to Aug. 12, showed Strange up by three points. That was 11 points better than his eight-point deficit in the last pre-endorsement poll.\nHowever, in context, that Emerson poll looks like an outlier. To believe that Strange was really up by three points at that stage of the contest would require dismissing two polls by the Republican firm the Trafalgar Group that bookended the Emerson poll by two days on each side. One had Moore ahead by 12, while the other had Moore ahead by 15.\nAs for polls after the rally, those undertaken at least partially afterward showed high and expanding leads for Moore.\nIndeed, if you look at the actual ballots cast -- the only vote that really counts -- Moore ended up outpacing Strange by an even wider margin in the runoff.\n\"Moore\u2019s edge over Strange grew from six points in the first round to nine in the second, so the actual votes suggest that Trump did not help Strange close the gap on Moore,\" said Kyle Kondik, an analyst at the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics.\nKondik also pointed to analysis of data from the polling firm 0ptimus by the Republican firm Firehouse Strategies. The analysis found that even as knowledge of Trump\u2019s endorsement of Strange became better known among the electorate, Moore\u2019s margin grew, from seven points on Sept. 13 to 10 points on Sept. 24, two days before the election.\n\"We can concretely say that Donald Trump\u2019s endorsement and active campaigning for Sen. Strange had absolutely no impact on the ballot,\" Firehouse Strategies concluded.\nOur ruling\nTrump tweeted that in the recent Alabama Senate runoff, \"the candidate I endorsed (Luther Strange) went up MANY points after endorsement!\"\nTrump can point to one poll that showed Strange narrowing Moore\u2019s lead by four points after his rally. But other polling data doesn\u2019t back this up, and his tweet glosses over the fact that he had announced his endorsement weeks earlier and that the increase in that one poll is so modest as to be within the margin of error.
