And between a slightly cloudy \"farmhouse ale\" and a wheat beer mixed with lemonade.\n\nBurke didn\u2019t equivocate in her reply.\n\n\"Spotted Cow,\" she said. \"New Glarus is a great brewery and Spotted Cow, you can only get it in Wisconsin and (it's) one of my favorites.\"\n\nWait, what? We didn\u2019t realize Spotted Cow was so exclusive.\n\nAnd when we asked some beer drinkers \u2014 journalists know a few \u2014 several seemed surprised that the brew wouldn\u2019t be available beyond the border.\n\n\"People love when politics and beer collide,\" noted Milwaukee Journal Sentinel columnist Jim Stingl.\n\nSo we decided to set aside policy debates (it is late August, after all, and we are planning that Labor Day cookout...) and tap this claim.\n\nIs Spotted Cow available only in the Badger State?\n\nBreweries and their brews\n\nSpotted Cow is the most popular beer produced by New Glarus, the brewery founded in 1993 by Deb and Dan Carey in the village of the same name in south central Wisconsin. New Glarus has enjoyed rapid growth, including a $21 million expansion, and then another $11 million addition.\n\nBut compared to the Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Co., New Glarus is tiny.\n\nLast year, New Glarus sold 146,000 barrels, making it the 17th largest craft brewery in the nation, said Eric Shepard, executive editor of Beer Marketer\u2019s Insights, a trade publication. Leinenkugel sold almost seven times as much, 975,000 barrels.\n\nAlso, Leinenkugel is a subsidiary of Chicago-based MillerCoors ,which has breweries in Milwaukee and other locations around the country. New Glarus is privately owned with 27 investors.\n\nMore important, for Burke\u2019s claim, is where the suds are sold.\n\nNew Glarus sold beer in Illinois for about six years before making a business decision to pull out in 2003. At the time, the Careys said they were unable to keep up with the demand and wanted to focus only on Wisconsin.\n\nIn 2010, Deb Carey gave a little more colorful elaboration to the Madison Beer Review, a beer-oriented website.\n\n\"Brewers call Chicago a whores' market,\" she said.\n\nCarey said New Glarus pulled out because \"it didn't want to participate in illegal business practices such as giving away beer to get bars to carry its products.\"\n\n\"Everyone has a hand out and everyone wants some cash, (free) beer or a discount,\" she said in the story. \"As far as I'm concerned, it's not worth the graft and hassle.\"\n\nShe added: \"Small brewers can't afford to pay to play. I really blame the big domestic brewers for creating this mess.\"\n\nIn an interview, Carey said that even though the brewery has ramped up production and could reach 250,000 barrels a year, the sales strategy won't change.\n\n\"I'd be happy to die and not sell beer out of state,\" she said. \"We're going to really drill down and focus on our No. 1 asset, which is (brewmaster) Dan, and make world class beer for our friends in Wisconsin.\"\n\nNew Glarus' website highlights the Wisconsin-only status with the prominent message: \"Only in Wisconsin.\" Labels say: \"Drink Indigenous\"\n\nShepard says New Glarus\u2019 strategy is unique among small brewers.\n\n\"New Glarus is by far the biggest craft brewer available in a single state,\" he said in an email.\n\nShandy also a hit\n\nIntroduced in 2007, Summer Shandy became a huge hit for Leinenkugel. Like Spotted Cow, it\u2019s the company\u2019s top seller.\n\nBut it\u2019s a lot easier to find a bottle of Shandy. Leinie\u2019s brews are advertised nationally, including during the NCAA men\u2019s basketball tourney. They\u2019re found in all 50 states. New Glarus does virtually no advertising.\n\nOf course, you can find Spotted Cow in fridges around the country, thanks to visitors who snare a case on their way home from Wisconsin, or who use the online gift shop.\n\nSo let\u2019s drain this one.\n\nOur rating\n\nBurke chose Spotted Cow as her beer of choice, saying she liked the beer and the fact it was available only in Wisconsin.\n\nThe brewery made a business decision and stopped out-of-state sales about 11 years ago. And that\u2019s become an important, if not entirely well known, selling point for the brewery ever since.\n\nWe rate her statement True.\n\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Godlewski\n\n\nstated on January 9, 2021 in Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all women that lost jobs (in the December jobs report), it was mostly Black and Latina women.
