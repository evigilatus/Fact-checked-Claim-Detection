0001	KELLY	Good evening, and welcome to the fabulous FOX Theatre in downtown Detroit, the site of the 11th Republican presidential debate of the 2016 campaign.
0002	KELLY	I'm Megyn Kelly, along with my comoderators, Bret Baier and Chris Wallace.
0003	BAIER	59 Republican delegates are at stake here in the state of Michigan during next Tuesday's Republican primary, the biggest prize out of four states holding contests that day.
0004	BAIER	For tonight's debate we're partnering with Facebook.
0005	BAIER	The conversation about this election has been intense, as the crowd is here.
0006	BAIER	Since January 1st, 53 million people in the U.S. have been talking about the election on Facebook.
0007	WALLACE	Tonight there are just four candidates on this stage.
0008	WALLACE	Their position has been determined by their standing in an average of the five most recent national polls as recognized by FOX News, and conducted and released by March 1st.
0009	WALLACE	Here they are.
0010	SYSTEM	[ cheering and applause ]
0011	WALLACE	Texas Senator, Ted Cruz.
0012	SYSTEM	[ cheering and applause ]
0013	WALLACE	Florida Senator, Marco Rubio.
0014	SYSTEM	[ cheering and applause ]
0015	WALLACE	And, Ohio Governor, John Kasich.
0016	SYSTEM	[ cheering and applause ]
0017	KELLY	Tonight's rules are simple.
0018	KELLY	Up to 60 seconds for each answer, 30 seconds for each followup response, and if a candidate goes over the allotted time, you will hear this.
0019	SYSTEM	[ bell ringing ]
0020	BAIER	So pleasant.
0021	KELLY	Really.
0022	BAIER	We have a big crowd here, and while we expect the audience to be enthusiastic and responsive at times...
0023	SYSTEM	[ cheering and applause ]
0024	BAIER	... they may have already been  we also expect them to be respectful, and we want the candidates to get their full time.
0025	BAIER	So, somewhere between a library and a Red Wings game.
0026	SYSTEM	[ laughter and cheering ]
0027	BAIER	Am I right?
0028	BAIER	Is that OK?
0029	BAIER	Let's get started.
0030	WALLACE	Mr. Trump, as you may have heard, the 2012 Republican nominee for President, Mitt Romney, had some things to say about you today.
0031	WALLACE	He said your domestic policy will lead to recession, he's said your foreign policy will make us less safe, and then he listed what he said are your personal qualities.
0032	WALLACE	Quoting now Romney on Trump, quote, "the bullying, the greed, the showing off, the misogyny, the absurd, thirdgrade theatrics".
0033	SYSTEM	[ cheering ]
0034	WALLACE	He challenged you to answer with substance, not insults.
0035	WALLACE	How do you answer Mitt Romney, sir?
0036	TRUMP	Well look, he was a failed candidate, he should have beaten president Obama very easy.
0037	TRUMP	He failed miserably, and it was an embarrassment to everybody, including the Republican party.
0038	TRUMP	It looked like he went away on a vacation the last month.
0039	TRUMP	So, I don't take that, and I guess, obviously, he wants to be relevant.
0040	TRUMP	He wants to be back in the game.
0041	TRUMP	As far as domestic policy and trade which is killing our country, he said free trade and I believe in free trade also.
0042	TRUMP	But, if you look at China, and you look Japan, and if you look at Mexico, both at the border, by the way, where they're killing us.
0043	TRUMP	Both at the border, and with trade  and every other country we do business with we are getting absolutely crushed on trade.
0044	TRUMP	And, he said free trade, I say free trade great.
0045	TRUMP	But, not when they're beating us so badly.
0046	TRUMP	With China we're going to lose $505 billion dollars in terms of trades.
0047	TRUMP	You just can't do it.
0048	TRUMP	Mexico, $58 billion dollars.
0049	TRUMP	Japan, probably about, they don't know it yet, but about $109 billion dollars.
0050	TRUMP	Every country we lose money with.
0051	TRUMP	As far as I'm concerned, we've got to reduce  we have to redo our trade deals 100 percent.
0052	TRUMP	I have the greatest business people in the world lined up to do it.
0053	TRUMP	We will make...
0054	SYSTEM	[ bell ringing ]
0055	TRUMP	... great trade deals.
0056	SYSTEM	[ cheering ]
0057	WALLACE	Mr. Trump, Romney also talked about your position on race, and the controversy over your failure to denounce David Duke on Sunday.
0058	WALLACE	You have repeatedly disavowed him since then, but I'd like to go deeper than that.
0059	WALLACE	What are your views on the Klu Klux Klan, and white supremacists?
0060	TRUMP	I totally disavow the Klu Klux Klan.
0061	TRUMP	I totally disavow David Duke.
0062	TRUMP	I've been doing it now for two weeks, this is your  you're probably about the 18th person that's asked me the question.
0063	TRUMP	It was very clear, that question was also talked about in the form of groups.
0064	TRUMP	Groups, I want to know which groups are you talking about?
0065	TRUMP	You have to tell me which groups?
0066	TRUMP	Ultimately, he got to the Klu Klux Klan, which obviously I'm going to disavow.
0067	TRUMP	And, by the way, if you look on my Twitter account, almost immediately after the program they were disavowed again.
0068	TRUMP	You know, it's amazing.
0069	TRUMP	When I do something on Twitter, everybody picks it up, goes all over the place.
0070	TRUMP	But, when I did this one nobody ever picks it up.
0071	TRUMP	Take a look at my Twitter account.
0072	WALLACE	Thank you, sir.
0073	TRUMP	Thank you.
0074	TRUMP	Thanks.
0075	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0076	BAIER	Senator Rubio, three weeks ago you said, quote "I don't do the personal attacks, primarily because it's not who I am, because I think it's beneath the office that I'm seeking but also because I don't want to embarrass my kids."
0077	BAIER	But in the past week you've mocked Mr. Trump's tan.
0078	BAIER	You've made fun of his spelling.
0079	BAIER	You called him a con artist.
0080	BAIER	You suggested he wet himself backstage at the last debate, along with other vulgar jokes and jabs.
0081	BAIER	So what happened?
0082	RUBIO	Yes, you know, Bret, let me say something.
0083	RUBIO	This campaign for the last year Donald Trump has basically mocked everybody with personal attacks.
0084	RUBIO	He has done so to people that are sitting on the stage today.
0085	RUBIO	He has done so about people that are disabled.
0086	RUBIO	He has done it about every candidate in this race.
0087	RUBIO	So if there is anyone who has ever deserved to be attacked that way, it has been Donald Trump, for the way he has treated people in the campaign.
0088	RUBIO	Now that said, I would much prefer to have a policy debate.
0089	RUBIO	I hope that's what we will have here tonight.
0090	RUBIO	Let's have a policy debate...
0091	TRUMP	And we will.
0092	RUBIO	... let's talk about Donald Trump's strategy and my strategy and Ted's strategy and John Kasich's strategy when it comes to ISIS.
0093	RUBIO	And on health care and on the important issues facing this country.
0094	RUBIO	But let's be honest too about all this.
0095	RUBIO	The media has given these personal attacks that Donald Trump has made an incredible amount of coverage.
0096	RUBIO	Let's start talking again about the issues that matter to this country.
0097	RUBIO	I'm ready to do that starting right here right now tonight.
0098	BAIER	Mr. Trump, your response?
0099	TRUMP	Well, I also happened to call him a lightweight, OK?
0100	TRUMP	And I have said that.
0101	TRUMP	So I would like to take that back.
0102	TRUMP	He is really not that much of a lightweight.
0103	TRUMP	And as far as  and I have to say this, I have to say this.
0104	TRUMP	He hit my hands.
0105	TRUMP	Nobody has ever hit my hands.
0106	TRUMP	I have never heard of this.
0107	TRUMP	Look at those hands.
0108	TRUMP	Are they small hands?
0109	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
0110	TRUMP	And he referred to my hands, if they are small, something else must be small.
0111	TRUMP	I guarantee you there is no problem.
0112	TRUMP	I guarantee.
0113	BAIER	OK. Moving on.
0114	KELLY	OK, Senator Cruz, you say that you are the true conservative in this race.
0115	KELLY	But 15 states have voted now, and you have won only four of them.
0116	KELLY	You have lost repeatedly with what is supposed to be your core voter groups, including evangelicals and conservatives.
0117	KELLY	Hasn't your brand of conservatism been rejected by an electorate that appears to be more taken with Mr. Trump's populist message?
0118	CRUZ	Well, Megyn, you know, at the end of the day for the folks at home, this is not about the insults back and forth between the candidates.
0119	CRUZ	This is not about what attacks we can throw at each other.
0120	CRUZ	This is the people at home who are struggling through seven years of Barack Obama.
0121	CRUZ	This is the single moms who are working two and three jobs, 28, 29 hours a week because their hours have been forcibly reduced because of Obamacare.
0122	CRUZ	This is the truck drivers and the steel workers and the mechanics with calluses on their hands who have seen their wages not grow year after year after year while the cost of living goes up.
0123	CRUZ	This is all the young people coming out of school with student loans up to their eyeballs that aren't able to find a job.
0124	CRUZ	And I don't think the people of America are interested in a bunch of bickering school children.
0125	CRUZ	They are interested in solutions, not slogans.
0126	CRUZ	It's easy to say, make things better, make things great.
0127	CRUZ	You can even print it and put it on a baseball cap.
0128	CRUZ	But the question is, do you understand the principles that made America great in the first place?
0129	CRUZ	As president, I will repeal every word of Obamacare.
0130	CRUZ	I will pull back the regulators that are killing small businesses.
0131	CRUZ	And we will pass a simple flat tax and abolish the IRS.
0132	CRUZ	And what that's going to do, Megyn, is small businesses are going to explode.
0133	CRUZ	We are going to see millions of highpaying jobs.
0134	CRUZ	We are going to see wages going up.
0135	CRUZ	We are going to see opportunity.
0136	CRUZ	That's where our focus needs to be.
0137	CRUZ	That's where my focus is.
0138	CRUZ	And that is why our campaign is the only campaign that over and over again has beaten Donald Trump to date, and it's why we are the one campaign that going forward can and will beat Donald Trump in this election.
0139	KELLY	Go ahead, Mr. Trump.
0140	TRUMP	I have heard Ted say that over and over again on television, that he is the only one that can beat me.
0141	TRUMP	Just, for the record, I have won 10.
0142	TRUMP	He has won three or four.
0143	TRUMP	Last week, in fact, on Tuesday, I was a half a million votes higher than him.
0144	TRUMP	I was a million votes higher than Marco, 1 million votes.
0145	TRUMP	That's a lot of votes.
0146	TRUMP	And was by far in first place.
0147	TRUMP	So I keep hearing that he is the only one that can beat me but he is getting beaten very, very badly.
0148	TRUMP	So where does this come from?
0149	TRUMP	Where does it come from?
0150	KELLY	Go ahead, Senator Rubio.
0151	RUBIO	Yes, I would just say a couple of things.
0152	RUBIO	There is no doubt that Donald has done well in these elections.
0153	RUBIO	There is no doubt about that.
0154	RUBIO	The numbers are there.
0155	RUBIO	Here is what the numbers also say.
0156	RUBIO	Twothirds of the people who have cast a vote in a Republican primary or caucus have voted against you.
0157	RUBIO	They do not want you to be our nominee.
0158	RUBIO	And, the reason why is because we are not going to turn over the conservative movement, or the party of Lincoln or Reagan, for example, to someone whose positions are not conservative.
0159	RUBIO	To someone who last week defended Planned Parenthood for 30 seconds a debate stage.
0160	RUBIO	To someone, for example, that has no ideas on foreign  someone who thinks the nuclear triad is a rock band from the 1980's.
0161	TRUMP	Oh yeah, you're...
0162	RUBIO	... To someone who time and again on issue after issue has not proven that he has the principals...
0163	SYSTEM	[ bell ringing ]
0164	RUBIO	... That outline what the conservative movement has been about.
0165	RUBIO	And, as Ted said, the things that made America great.
0166	RUBIO	America is great because of the conservative principles of limited government and free enterprise, and a strong national defense...
0167	KELLY	... OK...
0168	RUBIO	... And, our nominee needs to be someone that stands by those things...
0169	KELLY	... Alright...
0170	RUBIO	... Donald has not demonstrated that.
0171	KELLY	... Go ahead, Mr. Trump, and then we're going to have to go to Governor Kasich.
0172	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0173	TRUMP	Very nice words, but happens to be wrong.
0174	TRUMP	CNN just came out with a poll two days ago that...
0175	RUBIO	...
0176	SYSTEM	[ inaudible ]
0177	TRUMP	... That national poll  excuse me...
0178	RUBIO	...
0179	SYSTEM	[ inaudible ]
0180	TRUMP	...
0181	TRUMP	The national poll  a national poll where he's at 15, he's at 14...
0182	RUBIO	...
0183	SYSTEM	[ inaudible ]
0184	RUBIO	...
0185	TRUMP	... And, I'm at 49, so when he says 75 percent, that would mean that 80 percent of the people don't dig you, and I'm back down to 50...
0186	RUBIO	... Of all the people on this stage, he performs the worst against Hillary Clinton.
0187	TRUMP	Wrong...
0188	RUBIO	...
0189	RUBIO	If you're our nominee, we will lose...
0190	TRUMP	...
0191	TRUMP	I beat Hillary Clinton.
0192	TRUMP	I beat Hillary Clinton in many polls...
0193	RUBIO	... You lose by
0194	SYSTEM	[ inaudible ]
0195	RUBIO	points.
0196	RUBIO	She will wipe you out.
0197	TRUMP	I beat Hillary Clinton in many polls...
0198	RUBIO	If you're our nominee

0214	SYSTEM	[ inaudible ]
0215	TRUMP	...
0216	KELLY	...
0217	KELLY	The audience cannot understand when you're talking over each other.
0218	KELLY	Finish your point, Mr. Trump.
0219	TRUMP	...
0220	TRUMP	I beat Hillary Clinton in many polls.
0221	TRUMP	The Cue poll just came out.
0222	TRUMP	I beat Hillary Clinton in a recent Fox poll, I beat Hillary Clinton in USA Today, I beat her today in a poll in Ohio.
0223	TRUMP	I beat  I'm the only one that beats Hillary Clinton.
0224	TRUMP	I beat  and I have not started on Hillary yet.
0225	TRUMP	Believe me, I will...
0226	SYSTEM	[ cheering ]
0227	TRUMP	... start soon.
0228	TRUMP	I haven't even started.
0229	KELLY	OK.
0230	BAIER	Governor Kasich, today you admitted that you have a narrow path to the nomination through a contested convention.
0231	BAIER	Today also Mitt Romney proposed that Republicans should vote for Senator Rubio in Florida.
0232	BAIER	They should vote for you in Ohio.
0233	BAIER	They should vote for Senator Cruz in states that he can beat Mr. Trump to prevent Mr. Trump from getting the nomination.
0234	BAIER	So, do you buy Romney's blueprint, and can you say tonight to your Florida supporters that they should vote for Senator Rubio to get a contested convention?
0235	KASICH	You know, this so much about process.
0236	KASICH	It frankly is boring to me.
0237	KASICH	I would like it clear though, since we're talking about polls, I beat Hillary Clinton by more than 11 points, and the reason it happens...
0238	SYSTEM	[ cheering ]
0239	TRUMP	...
0240	TRUMP	In one poll...
0241	KASICH	...
0242	KASICH	The reason it happens...
0243	TRUMP	...
0244	TRUMP	In one poll...
0245	KASICH	... You know, the reason is because, as the Democrats tell me all the time, I can get the crossover votes.
0246	KASICH	You see, because throughout this campaign I've talked about issues, I have never tried to go and get into these scrums that we're seeing here on the stage.
0247	KASICH	And, people say everywhere I go, "you seem to be the adult on the stage."
0248	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0249	KASICH	In terms of  you know, Mitt Romney's a great guy, but he doesn't determine my strategy.
0250	KASICH	The fact of the matter is I'm running for president because I worked hard to fix this country when I was in Washington as the Chairman of the Budget Committee where we had some of the most significant job growth after we balanced the budget.
0251	KASICH	We had wages going up, it was very successful in Ohio.
0252	KASICH	Our wages grow faster than the national average.
0253	KASICH	We're up over 400,000 jobs.
0254	KASICH	We paid down, back in the old days, they paid down half a trillion dollars of the national debt.
0255	KASICH	It's a formula that works.
0256	KASICH	And, I believe that formula will work when I return to Washington as the president.
0257	KASICH	And, by the way, I won't need on the job training because I know how to do all of this, and within the first 100 days I will have a plan that will pass the Congress because...
0258	SYSTEM	[ bell ringing ]
0259	KASICH	...
0260	KASICH	It is reasonable, and I can bring both sides together...
0261	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0262	BAIER	...
0263	BAIER	But Governor, this is all about process.
0264	BAIER	For voters, they need to see a path to get to the nomination if they're going to support you.
0265	BAIER	On Super Tuesday you finished in single digits in nine out of 11 states.
0266	BAIER	So, you can see that your path is through a contested convention.
0267	BAIER	How do you...
0268	KASICH	... Well, Bret, I think we're all really there.
0269	KASICH	I mean, the simple fact is that, you know, you all wrote me off.
0270	KASICH	You wrote me off before I even got to New Hampshire, then when I finished in New Hampshire you wrote me off in the South, then you wrote me off in Super Tuesday.
0271	KASICH	I split delegates in Vermont with Donald Trump, I finished second in Massachusetts, and we won delegates in Virginia.
0272	KASICH	But, guess what?
0273	KASICH	It's now March Madness and we're heading up North to the place  to my turf, OK?
0274	SYSTEM	[ cheering ]
0275	KASICH	And, let me just tell you this, I will win Ohio, and I am going to move all across this country, and over time as people begin to finally hear my message  you know what people say, Bret, to me all the time?
0276	KASICH	Why don't they give you any time on the debate stage?
0277	KASICH	Why is that?
0278	SYSTEM	[ cheering ]
0279	KASICH	So now all of a sudden, I'm starting to get it, and what I want the people to know is, I know how to bring people together, Republicans and Democrats.
0280	KASICH	I have successfully, both at the federal level and the state level brought economic growth, wage growth, and economic security to this country.
0281	KASICH	And I want to go back and do it again, and I'm going to keep talking about my message of bringing people together and motivating people in the neighborhoods that realize they don't need somebody from Washington galloping in.
0282	KASICH	There are many things they can do where they live, because the strength of our country is in our neighborhoods and our families.
0283	KASICH	And I'm going to keep doing this.
0284	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0285	BAIER	Thank you.
0286	WALLACE	Well, then, we want to focus now on the economy, which is one of the top issues on Facebook, with 6.6 million people discussing it online.
0287	WALLACE	A lot of that conversation is happening here in Detroit, where the unemployment rate is 10.9 percent.
0288	WALLACE	That's more than double the national average.
0289	WALLACE	Senator Rubio, you have taken to calling Mr. Trump a con artist who portrays himself as a hero to working people while he's really been, in your words, "sticking it" to the American workers for 40 years.
0290	WALLACE	But he has built a big company that employs thousands of people.
0291	WALLACE	Question.
0292	WALLACE	How many jobs have you created?
0293	RUBIO	Well, first of all, government doesn't...
0294	SYSTEM	[ audience booing ]
0295	RUBIO	First of all, Chris, my point is exactly right.
0296	RUBIO	He has spent a career of convincing Americans that he's something that he's not in exchange for their money.
0297	RUBIO	Now he's trying to do the same in exchange for their country.
0298	RUBIO	This is a fact.
0299	RUBIO	He talks about these great businesses that he's built.
0300	RUBIO	He inherited over $100 million.
0301	TRUMP	Wrong.
0302	TRUMP	Wrong.
0303	RUBIO	And with that money, he lost more money than he made.
0304	WALLACE	Mr. Trump, it's not your turn.
0305	WALLACE	You'll get your turn, sir.
0306	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
0307	RUBIO	He can start tonight by announcing that all the Donald Trump clothing will no longer be made in China and in Mexico, but will be made here in the United States.
0308	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0309	RUBIO	And on the issue of job creation, I find this interesting.
0310	RUBIO	The private sector creates jobs.
0311	RUBIO	The jobs of those of us in public service are to put in place policies that allow the economy to grow.
0312	RUBIO	That's the problem with the Democratic Party.
0313	RUBIO	They think government is what creates jobs.
0314	RUBIO	Government does not create jobs.
0315	RUBIO	Now, the way you create jobs is you make America the easiest and the best place in the world to start a business or to expand an existing business.
0316	RUBIO	If you go on my website, marcorubio.com, you will see a real plan to fix our taxes, to roll back regulations, to repeal and replace Obamacare, not just lines around the states.
0317	RUBIO	Serious policies and proposals.
0318	WALLACE	Sir?
0319	WALLACE	Mr. Trump, I'd like you to respond.
0320	WALLACE	You have 30 seconds to respond.
0321	WALLACE	But as part of that, could you respond to his specific assertion about Trump Collection clothes, which you say some of it is made in Mexico?
0322	TRUMP	This little guy has lied so much...
0323	RUBIO	Here we go.
0324	TRUMP	... about my record.
0325	RUBIO	Here we go.
0326	RUBIO	It's personal.
0327	SYSTEM	[ audience booing ]
0328	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
0329	TRUMP	He has lied so much about my record.
0330	WALLACE	Mr. Rubio  Senator Rubio, why don't you let him finish?
0331	TRUMP	And I will tell you this.
0332	TRUMP	First of all, I got a call from my sister and brother tonight, and they said we had no idea Dad gave you $200 million.
0333	TRUMP	Believe me, I started off with $1 million.
0334	TRUMP	I built a company that's worth more than $10 billion.
0335	TRUMP	And I say it not in a bragging way, but that's the kind of thinking we need.
0336	TRUMP	Very low debt, tremendous cash flow.
0337	TRUMP	My financials are all  they're all in there with the federal elections.
0338	TRUMP	You've seen them.
0339	TRUMP	Everybody has seen them.
0340	TRUMP	I say it only because that's the kind of thinking this country needs with $19 trillion in debit.
0341	TRUMP	Believe me.
0342	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0343	WALLACE	But wait one second.
0344	WALLACE	Specifically and quickly on the question, will you promise that you will  and how soon will you move your clothing collection, the clothes that are made in China and Mexico?
0345	TRUMP	They devalue their currencies.
0346	TRUMP	I will do that.
0347	TRUMP	And by the way, I have been doing it more and more.
0348	TRUMP	But they devalue their currencies, in particular China.
0349	TRUMP	Mexico is doing a big number now, also.
0350	TRUMP	Japan is unbelievable what they're doing.
0351	TRUMP	They devalue their currencies, and they make it impossible for clothingmakers in this country to do clothing in this country.
0352	TRUMP	And if you look at what's happened on Seventh Avenue, and you look at what's happened in New York with the garment industry, so much of the clothing now comes out from Vietnam, China, and other places.
0353	TRUMP	And it's all because of devaluation.
0354	TRUMP	By the way, the TransPacific, if you look at the TPP, a total disaster, which, by the way, Marco is in favor of, they need  it is a disaster for our country.
0355	TRUMP	It's trying to be approved by various people, including President Obama.
0356	TRUMP	And I'll tell you something.
0357	TRUMP	The biggest problem with that is They don't take into concurrence the devaluation.
0358	TRUMP	They're devaluing their currency.
0359	WALLACE	Thank you.
0360	WALLACE	Thank you, Mr. Trump.
0361	WALLACE	Senator Rubio?
0362	TRUMP	And they're killing  they're going to...
0363	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
0364	WALLACE	Wait, wait, Senator Rubio.
0365	RUBIO	The answer is, he's not going to do it.
0366	RUBIO	And you know why?
0367	RUBIO	Because there are plenty of clothing makers in America.
0368	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0369	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
0370	RUBIO	If you go on my website, marcorubio.com, everything we have on there is made in America.
0371	RUBIO	The reason why he makes it in China or Mexico is because he can make more money on it.
0372	RUBIO	That's why he's doing it.
0373	RUBIO	And the second point, you see what happens, again, when you challenge him on a policy issue.
0374	RUBIO	You asked him about the economy, and the first thing he does is launch an attack about some little guy thing.
0375	RUBIO	Because he doesn't have answers.
0376	TRUMP	No, no.
0377	TRUMP	I have very good answers.
0378	RUBIO	And he's asking us to make him the president of the United States of America.

0386	TRUMP	You haven't employed in your life one person.
0387	RUBIO	But he doesn't answer the employment question.

0394	TRUMP	You know what?
0395	TRUMP	Take a look at Trump Steaks.
0396	RUBIO	All of these companies he has ruined.
0397	TRUMP	By the way, that's the other thing...
0398	RUBIO	Trump Steaks is gone.
0399	RUBIO	You have ruined these companies.

0417	WALLACE	You have got to do better than this.
0418	TRUMP	This guy has a number one  the number one absentee record in the United States...
0419	WALLACE	Mr. Trump, I would like to ask you a policy question.
0420	TRUMP	He doesn't show up to vote.
0421	WALLACE	Your proposed tax cut...
0422	TRUMP	That's why the people in Florida do not like him.
0423	WALLACE	Mr. Trump, your proposed tax cut would add $10 trillion to the nation's debt over 10 years, even if the economy grows the way that you say it will.
0424	WALLACE	You insist that you could make up for a good deal of that, you say, by cutting waste, fraud, and abuse.
0425	TRUMP	Correct.
0426	WALLACE	Like what?
0427	WALLACE	And please be specific.
0428	TRUMP	Department of Education.
0429	TRUMP	We're cutting Common Core.
0430	TRUMP	We're getting rid of Common Core.
0431	TRUMP	We're bringing education locally.
0432	TRUMP	Department of Environmental Protection.
0433	TRUMP	We are going to get rid are of it in almost every form.
0434	TRUMP	We're going to have little tidbits left but we're going to take a tremendous amount out.
0435	TRUMP	We have various other things.
0436	TRUMP	If you look at the IRS, if you look at every single agency, we can cut it down, and I mean really cut it down and save.
0437	TRUMP	The waste, fraud, and abuse is massive.
0438	TRUMP	Larry Kudlow, great guy, everybody respects him, said my plan for taxes and tax cutting is the best by far of everybody.
0439	WALLACE	But, Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump, your numbers don't add up.
0440	WALLACE	Please put up full screen number four.
0441	WALLACE	The Education Department, you talk about cutting, the total budget for the education department is $78 billion.
0442	WALLACE	And that includes Pell grants for lowincome students and aid to states for special education.
0443	WALLACE	I assume you wouldn't cut those things.
0444	WALLACE	The entire budget for the EPA, the Environmental Protection Agency, $8 billion.
0445	TRUMP	OK.
0446	WALLACE	The deficit this year is $544 billion.
0447	WALLACE	That's more than a half trillion dollars.
0448	WALLACE	Your numbers don't add up, sir.
0449	TRUMP	Let me explain something.
0450	TRUMP	Because of the fact that the pharmaceutical companies  because of the fact that the pharmaceutical companies are not mandated to bid properly, they have hundreds of billions of dollars in waste.
0451	TRUMP	We don't bid properly.
0452	TRUMP	We don't have proper bidding procedures.
0453	TRUMP	The reason we don't is because they take care of all of the senators, all of the congressman, and they don't bid.
0454	TRUMP	They don't go out to bid.
0455	WALLACE	Mr. Trump...
0456	TRUMP	Take a look  excuse me.
0457	TRUMP	You are talking about hundreds of billions of dollars...
0458	WALLACE	No, you are not.
0459	TRUMP	... if we went out to the proper bid.
0460	TRUMP	Of course you are.
0461	WALLACE	No, you're not, sir.
0462	WALLACE	Let's put up full screen number 2.
0463	WALLACE	You say that Medicare could save $300 billion a year negotiating lower drug prices.
0464	WALLACE	But Medicare total only spends $78 billion a year on drugs.
0465	WALLACE	Sir, that's the facts.
0466	WALLACE	You are talking about saving more money on Medicare prescription drugs...
0467	TRUMP	I'm saying saving through negotiation throughout the economy, you will save $300 billion a year.
0468	WALLACE	But that doesn't really cut the federal deficit.
0469	TRUMP	And that's a huge  of course it is.
0470	TRUMP	We are going to buy things for less money.
0471	TRUMP	Of course it is.
0472	TRUMP	That works out...
0473	WALLACE	That's the only money that we buy  the only drugs that we pay for is through Medicare.
0474	TRUMP	I'm not only talking about drugs, I'm talking about other things.
0475	TRUMP	We will save $300 billion a year if we properly negotiate.
0476	TRUMP	We don't do that.
0477	TRUMP	We don't negotiate.
0478	TRUMP	We don't negotiate anything.
0479	KASICH	Can I...
0480	WALLACE	No.
0481	WALLACE	I promise I will get to you in a moment, sir.
0482	WALLACE	Senator Cruz, one of centerpieces of your campaign, in fact, you mentioned it again tonight, is that you will abolish the IRS.
0483	WALLACE	Question though, who will collect the taxes that you are still calling for?
0484	WALLACE	Who will oversee to make sure that people pay the taxes that they rightfully owe?
0485	WALLACE	And who will check on the various tax deductions and tax credits that you still want?
0486	CRUZ	So my simple flat tax I have rolled out in precise detail how it will operate where every American can fill out our taxes on a postcard.
0487	CRUZ	And if you want to actually see the postcard, see all the details, you can find them on our Web site.
0488	CRUZ	It's tedcruz.org.
0489	CRUZ	When he we get rid of all the corporate welfare, all the subsidies, all the carveouts in the IRS code, it dramatically simplifies it.
0490	CRUZ	And under Obama, the IRS has become so corrupt and so politicized we need to abolish it all together.
0491	CRUZ	Now, at the end of that there will still be an office in the Treasury Department to receive the postcards but it will be dramatically simpler.
0492	CRUZ	And let me take a moment, Chris, to go back to go back to this exchange that was going on.
0493	CRUZ	In between all of the insults, let me point out the specificity that was lacking.
0494	CRUZ	It's very easy to say, "Let's cut waste, fraud, and abuse."
0495	CRUZ	I've rolled out a detailed plan to cut $500 billion in federal spending, specifying exactly what I would cut.
0496	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0497	CRUZ	It's easy to say it, but one of the great disconnects to all the people, all of the voters, I understand the folks who are supporting Donald right now.
0498	CRUZ	You're angry.
0499	CRUZ	You're angry at Washington, and he uses angry rhetoric.
0500	CRUZ	But for 40 years, Donald has been part of the corruption in Washington that you're angry about.
0501	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0502	CRUZ	And you're not going to stop the corruption in Washington by supporting someone who has supported liberal Democrats for four decades, from Jimmy Carter to John Kerry to Hillary Clinton.
0503	CRUZ	You're not going to stop the corruption and the cronyism by supporting someone who has used government power for private gain.
0504	CRUZ	Instead, we need a president who stands with the American people.
0505	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0506	WALLACE	Governor Kasich, I promise I will get to you.
0507	WALLACE	But you do get 30 seconds to respond, Mr. Trump.
0508	TRUMP	Well, all of a sudden, I hear for 40 years I've been involved in Washington.
0509	TRUMP	I have been supporting people for many years.
0510	TRUMP	And these people have been politicians, and they've been on both sides, Democrats, Republicans, liberals, conservatives.
0511	TRUMP	I've supported everybody, because, until recently, I wasn't a politician, and I hope maybe you don't all consider me a politician right now.
0512	TRUMP	I hate the term politician.
0513	TRUMP	But I've been supporting politicians.
0514	TRUMP	A recent article somewhere said Donald Trump is a worldclass businessman who goes out and he does get along with everybody.
0515	TRUMP	I've supported Democrats, and I've supported Republicans.
0516	TRUMP	And as a businessman, I owed that to my company, to my family, to my workers, to everybody to get along.
0517	TRUMP	Part of the problem we have in Washington, Chris...
0518	WALLACE	Mr. Trump...
0519	TRUMP	... is it's total gridlock.
0520	TRUMP	Nobody gets along.
0521	TRUMP	We need people to get along.
0522	TRUMP	We need to be able to get things done.
0523	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0524	WALLACE	Governor Kasich, Democrats, as you know, will make income inequality a big issue in the general election.
0525	WALLACE	You support raising the minimum wage, although you say not to the $15 an hour that Democrats are talking about.
0526	WALLACE	Mr. Trump opposes any increase because he says it will price American workers out of the world market.
0527	WALLACE	Is he wrong about that?
0528	WALLACE	No increase in the minimum wage?
0529	KASICH	Well, well, wait a minute, first of all, I didn't say I was for an increase in the federal minimum wage.
0530	KASICH	I said in Ohio we increased it modestly every single year.
0531	KASICH	So I'm not for a federal minimum wage increase.
0532	WALLACE	But you did talk about states doing it.
0533	KASICH	Well, states  if states want to do it, they ought to sit down with businesspeople and the lawmakers and figure out what will work.
0534	KASICH	But hold on a second here with everything else.
0535	KASICH	I'm the only person on this stage who actually was the chief architect of balancing the federal budget.
0536	KASICH	It's not a theory for me.
0537	KASICH	It's not  it's not some  you have to know how to put everything together.
0538	KASICH	And you know, I spent 10 years of my life to get there, and I did not do that because I'm worshiping at some balanced budget shrine.
0539	KASICH	The reason I did it is when you have commonsense regulations, lower taxes on individuals and businesses, and you have a fiscal plan that makes sense, the job creators will expand employment.
0540	KASICH	And what happened?
0541	KASICH	When I was there, the jobs were exploding.
0542	KASICH	Bill Clinton's tried to take credit for it.
0543	KASICH	When I went to Ohio, we're up 400,000 jobs.
0544	KASICH	It's the same formula.
0545	KASICH	But it isn't easy.
0546	KASICH	I fought the entire Washington establishment and won, because when you balance a budget, you must affect every single thing.
0547	KASICH	Everything in the federal government specifically.
0548	KASICH	You cannot get there with theories or broad statements, and you have to be willing to take the heat.
0549	KASICH	In fact, I fought a Republican president, who I thought was not offering constructive proposals to fix this economy.
0550	KASICH	So when we talk about all this, there's one person on this stage and one person who's been a candidate for president in either party that restored economic strength, growth, a balanced budget, paid down debt, cut taxes, the things that people in this country want.
0551	KASICH	No theories.
0552	KASICH	Reality.

0554	WALLACE	Thank you, Governor.
0555	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0556	KELLY	All right.
0557	KELLY	Let's talk immigration for a little bit.
0558	KELLY	Senator Cruz, let's start with you.
0559	KELLY	You have repeatedly touted how you have stood shoulder to shoulder with Senator Jeff Sessions to fight illegal immigration and amnesty.
0560	KELLY	But Senator Sessions just endorsed Donald Trump.
0561	KELLY	If voters want Jeff Sessionsstyle immigration policies, isn't their choice rather clear?
0562	CRUZ	Yes, their choice is very clear.
0563	CRUZ	If you look to the actual record  you know, Donald mentioned a moment ago that he was just doing business when he was writing checks to liberal Democrats.
0564	CRUZ	But that's not, in fact, the checks he was writing.
0565	CRUZ	Listen, we could all understand if you write a check to a city commission because you're looking for a zoning waiver on building a building.
0566	CRUZ	That may be corrupt, but you could understand real estate developers doing that.
0567	CRUZ	That's not what Donald Trump did.
0568	CRUZ	Donald Trump supported Jimmy Carter over Ronald Reagan.
0569	CRUZ	Donald supported John Kerry over George W. Bush.
0570	CRUZ	If you don't like Obamacare, Donald Trump funded Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi taking over Congress to pass Obamacare.
0571	CRUZ	On immigration, if you don't like amnesty, if you don't like the Gang of Eight, Donald Trump funded five of the eight members of the Gang of Eight $50,000.
0572	CRUZ	And let's talk about this election.
0573	CRUZ	The choice Republican primary voters are making is who is best prepared to stand up to Hillary Clinton and beat Hillary Clinton.
0574	CRUZ	Donald Trump has written checks to Hillary Clinton not once, not twice, not three times.
0575	CRUZ	Ten times.
0576	CRUZ	And four of those checks were not to her Senate campaign.
0577	CRUZ	It wasn't that she was the New York senator and it was a cost of doing business.
0578	CRUZ	It was to her presidential campaign.
0579	CRUZ	Donald Trump in 2008 wrote four checks to elect Hillary Clinton as president.
0580	KELLY	OK.
0581	CRUZ	So I'd like to ask Donald, why did you write checks to Hillary Clinton to be president in 2008?
0582	CRUZ	It wasn't for business.
0583	CRUZ	And how can you stand on a debate stage now with her and say you don't think she should be president?
0584	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0585	TRUMP	Actually, it was for business.
0586	TRUMP	It was.
0587	TRUMP	It was.
0588	TRUMP	It was for business.
0589	TRUMP	I pride myself, including outside of the United States.
0590	TRUMP	I'm doing almost 120 deals outside of the  which I hope to be able to stop very soon and let my children handle it  but we're doing many, many deals outside of the United States.
0591	TRUMP	I support politicians.
0592	TRUMP	In 2008, I supported Hillary Clinton.
0593	TRUMP	I supported many other people, by the way.
0594	TRUMP	And that was because of the fact that I'm in business.
0595	TRUMP	I did support very heavily Ronald Reagan.
0596	TRUMP	I also supported George Bush, by the way.
0597	KELLY	All right.
0598	KELLY	Mr. Trump...
0599	CRUZ	But what would you say...
0600	KELLY	Well, stand by  stand by, Senator Cruz.
0601	CRUZ	... to Hillary Clinton on the debate stage when you wrote her a check in 2008, wrote her four checks to be president?
0602	TRUMP	Let me tell you, something, Ted.
0603	TRUMP	The last person that Hillary Clinton wants to face is Donald Trump.
0604	TRUMP	That I can...
0605	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0606	KELLY	Let's move on.
0607	KELLY	And with all due respect, we have  we have questions.
0608	KELLY	We have questions.
0609	TRUMP	That I can tell you.
0610	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
0611	KELLY	No, no, no.
0612	KELLY	Hold on.
0613	KELLY	Hold on.
0614	KELLY	We can do more of this later.
0615	KELLY	Mr. Trump, hi.
0616	TRUMP	Hello.
0617	KELLY	How are you doing?
0618	TRUMP	Nice to be with you, Megyn.
0619	KELLY	Great to have you here.
0620	TRUMP	You're looking well.
0621	TRUMP	You're looking well.
0622	KELLY	As are you.
0623	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0624	KELLY	Back in January, you gave an offtherecord interview to the New York Times.
0625	KELLY	It was apparently audiotaped.
0626	KELLY	Now, a recent report in Buzzfeed citing sources at the Times reports that in that interview you expressed flexibility when it comes to your immigration policy, specifically with respect to your promise to deport the 11 million people who are now living here illegally.
0627	KELLY	You have suggested that you may have expressed some flexibility when it comes to the size of the wall that you want to build.
0628	KELLY	But did you tell them, specifically, that you are flexible when it comes to your deportation plan?
0629	TRUMP	I don't know exactly what  when you talk about off the record.
0630	TRUMP	First of all, Buzzfeed?
0631	TRUMP	They were the ones that said under no circumstances will I run for president.
0632	TRUMP	And were they wrong.
0633	TRUMP	But a lot of people said that.
0634	TRUMP	Then, I did have a meeting with the editorial board of the New York Times, a very nice meeting.
0635	TRUMP	Many of those things were off the record, I think at their suggestion and my suggestion.
0636	TRUMP	And I think being off the record is a very important thing.
0637	TRUMP	I think it's a very, very powerful thing.
0638	TRUMP	And I will say this.
0639	TRUMP	These three gentlemen have gone off the record many times with reporters.
0640	TRUMP	And I think they want to honor it, and I would always honor that.
0641	TRUMP	I will say, though, in terms of immigration  and almost anything else  there always has to be some, you know, tug and pull and deal.
0642	TRUMP	And, you know, when I watch Ted stand on the Senate floor, I had great respect for what he did.
0643	TRUMP	He stood there for a dayanda half or something.
0644	TRUMP	In the meantime, what came of it?
0645	TRUMP	Nothing.
0646	TRUMP	You have to be able to have some flexibility, some negotiation.
0647	TRUMP	Now, sometimes you ask for more than you want and you negotiate down to the point.
0648	TRUMP	I may have discussed something like that with the New York Times, but I would never release offtherecord conversations.
0649	TRUMP	I don't think it's fair, frankly, to do that to anybody.
0650	KELLY	How flexible are you on this issue?
0651	SYSTEM	[ audience booing ]
0652	TRUMP	Not very flexible.
0653	TRUMP	No, not very flexible.
0654	TRUMP	I give the example  I'm going to build a wall.
0655	TRUMP	I'm the one that wants the wall.
0656	TRUMP	I'm the one that can build the wall.
0657	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0658	TRUMP	It's going to get built.
0659	TRUMP	And by the way, Mexico is going to pay for the wall.
0660	TRUMP	I can tell you that.
0661	TRUMP	Mexico is going to pay for the wall.
0662	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0663	TRUMP	But  and I used an example.
0664	TRUMP	And this isn't necessarily what was said, but whatever was said, the wall's 50 feet high.
0665	TRUMP	Is it going to be 45 feet or 40 feet?
0666	TRUMP	That could very well be.
0667	TRUMP	That could very well  he wants it to be higher.
0668	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
0669	TRUMP	That could very well be.
0670	TRUMP	But there's always give and take.
0671	TRUMP	There's always negotiation.
0672	TRUMP	And the best negotiator that knows what he's doing will make a great deal.
0673	TRUMP	But we need give and take in government.
0674	TRUMP	If you don't have give and take, you're never going to agree on anything.
0675	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0676	KELLY	Senator Rubio, you not only supported the failed immigration reform effort through the Gang of Eight, but you're still on record as favoring an eventual path to citizenship for those who are here illegally.
0677	KELLY	And in addition...
0678	SYSTEM	[ audience booing ]
0679	KELLY	...you favored instate tuition for Florida illegal immigrants.
0680	KELLY	You've been hitting Mr. Trump hard on this flexibility discussion with the New York Times, but his supporters might say at least his opening stance was tough.
0681	RUBIO	Well, first of all, let me say that on the issue of the offtherecord, that's not up to the New York Times.
0682	RUBIO	That's up to you, Donald.
0683	RUBIO	If tonight you tell the New York Times to release the audio, they will do it, and we can exactly see what your true views are on immigration...
0684	TRUMP	Fine.
0685	RUBIO	... because it is a major issue, in your campaign that you've made a center issue.
0686	RUBIO	Now, as far as my record on it is concerned, I absolutely want to solve this issue.
0687	RUBIO	And I did the best we could in a Senate that was controlled by liberal Democrats and Harry Reid in the hopes that the House, made up of conservatives, would take it up and make it even stronger.
0688	RUBIO	And I said that repeatedly at the time.
0689	RUBIO	I'm not just saying that now I said it throughout that process.
0690	RUBIO	We do need to do with this issue.
0691	SYSTEM	[ audience booing ]
0692	RUBIO	When I'm president it will not be dealt with the way it was done in the Senate.
0693	RUBIO	It will be done first and foremost by bringing illegal immigration under control and proving it to the American people.
0694	RUBIO	And only after that is done can anything else happen.
0695	RUBIO	And it will be something the American people support.
0696	RUBIO	We'll see what they are willing to support.
0697	RUBIO	It's not going to be an executive order and we're not going to ram it down their throats.
0698	KELLY	Mr. Trump, we will let respond, but will you release the tapes?
0699	KELLY	Will you authorize of The Times to release the tapes?
0700	TRUMP	I will say one thing, what Marco said is  I understand it.
0701	TRUMP	He is talking about a little give and take and a little negotiation.
0702	TRUMP	And you know what?
0703	TRUMP	That's OK. That's not the worst thing in the world.
0704	TRUMP	There is nothing wrong with that.
0705	TRUMP	I happen to be much stronger on illegal immigration.
0706	TRUMP	Sheriff Joe Arpaio endorsed me.
0707	TRUMP	And if he endorses you, believe me, you are the strongest, from Arizona.
0708	TRUMP	But give and take is OK. And I thought what he said is OK. We may differ on the degree.
0709	TRUMP	But what he said to me is OK.
0710	KELLY	Will you release the tapes?
0711	TRUMP	No.
0712	TRUMP	I never do that.
0713	TRUMP	I would not do that.
0714	TRUMP	I don't think  I have too much respect  if I deal with you off the record, if I deal with Bret or Chris off the record, I have too much respect for that process to say, just release everything.
0715	TRUMP	I would not do that.
0716	KELLY	OK.
0717	KELLY	Stand by.
0718	KELLY	We're going to continue this right after the break.
0719	KELLY	We have more.
0720	BAIER	Coming up, more with Megyn on immigration, plus questions on other top issues, including the war on terror.
0721	BAIER	The "FOX News Republican Presidential Debate Live from Detroit" continues after a quick break.
0722	SYSTEM	[ commercial break ]
0723	KELLY	Welcome back everybody to the FOX News Republican presidential debate, live from the FOX theater here in Detroit.
0724	KELLY	Let's get back now to the questions.
0725	KELLY	Mr. Trump, your campaign website to this day argues that more visas for highly skilled workers would, quote, "decimate American workers".
0726	KELLY	However, at the CNBC debate, you spoke enthusiastically in favor of these visas.
0727	KELLY	So, which is it?
0728	TRUMP	I'm changing.
0729	TRUMP	I'm changing.
0730	TRUMP	We need highly skilled people in this country, and if we can't do it, we'll get them in.
0731	TRUMP	But, and we do need in Silicon Valley, we absolutely have to have.
0732	TRUMP	So, we do need highly skilled, and one of the biggest problems we have is people go to the best colleges.
0733	TRUMP	They'll go to Harvard, they'll go to Stanford, they'll go to Wharton, as soon as they're finished they'll get shoved out.
0734	TRUMP	They want to stay in this country.
0735	TRUMP	They want to stay here desperately, they're not able to stay here.
0736	TRUMP	For that purpose, we absolutely have to be able to keep the brain power in this country.
0737	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0738	KELLY	So you abandoning the position on your website...
0739	TRUMP	...
0740	TRUMP	I'm changing it, and I'm softening the position because we have to have talented people in this country.
0741	KELLY	And you're not releasing the discussion with the New York Times behind closed doors...
0742	TRUMP	... That is correct.
0743	KELLY	Which will have some asking whether, on your immigration policies, you're really just playing to people's fantasies, which is a tactic...
0744	TRUMP	... No, I'm not playing.
0745	KELLY	... you praised in your book, The Art of the Deal.
0746	TRUMP	I'm not playing to anybody's fantasies, I'm playing to the fact that our country is in trouble, that we have a tremendous problem with crime.
0747	TRUMP	The border is a disaster, it's like a piece of Swiss cheese.
0748	TRUMP	We're going to stop it, we're going to stop people from coming into our country illegally.
0749	TRUMP	We're going to stop it.
0750	TRUMP	[
0751	TRUMP	applause ]
0752	SYSTEM	[ cheering ]
0753	KELLY	Senator Cruz, not long ago you propose quintupling the number of these foreign worker visas.
0754	KELLY	After you announced for president, you reversed yourself, citing reports that the program was being abused.
0755	KELLY	But, that abuse had been around long before your 180.
0756	KELLY	In fact, it was so bad that just a few months earlier that a bipartisan group of senators called for an investigation and you declined to join them.
0757	KELLY	Isn't it a good thing that the American public didn't trust Ted on that one?
0758	CRUZ	Well, the abuse of the H1B program has been rampant.
0759	CRUZ	On the face of that H1B abuse, I have proposed, and promised as president that I will impose a 180 day moratorium on the H1B program to implement a comprehensive investigation and audit because you got U.S. companies that are firing American workers, bringing in foreign workers, and forcing them to train their replacements.
0760	CRUZ	And, I would note that is not dissimilar to what we discovered at the last debate concerning the hotel that Donald owns down in Florida.
0761	CRUZ	Down in Florida that hotel has brought in hundreds of foreign workers, and afterwards it was really striking.
0762	CRUZ	I watched the CNN interview Donald did where he explained, he said, well the problem is you can't find Americans who are qualified, or who want to work as waiters and waitresses.
0763	CRUZ	Now, let me ask the people here, how many people have worked as a waiter or waitress?
0764	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0765	CRUZ	Millions across this country.
0766	CRUZ	That is an astonishing statement.
0767	CRUZ	You know, Marco's Dad started as a bartender.
0768	CRUZ	My Dad started washing dishes, and yet, you know how many Americans wanted those jobs?
0769	SYSTEM	[ bell ringing ]
0770	CRUZ	Roughly 300 applied, Donald hired 17.
0771	CRUZ	And, that's why this New York Times tape is so troubling because what's been reported is that Donald told the Editorial Board of the New York Times what I'm saying on immigration, I don't believe.
0772	CRUZ	I'm not going to build a wall, I'm not going to deport people, this is all just rhetoric for the voters.
0773	CRUZ	Now, if he didn't say that, he has an easy solution.
0774	CRUZ	Simply release the tape.
0775	CRUZ	But, for everyone at home who's mad at politicians that lied to us, Donald's record right now as he standing here...
0776	KELLY	... OK.
0777	CRUZ	... His record right now is one of repeatedly hiring illegal aliens...
0778	KELLY	... Times up, sir...
0779	CRUZ	... abusing American workers...
0780	KELLY	... Go ahead, Mr. Trump.
0781	TRUMP	First of all I've had tens of thousands of people working for me, most of which are  98, 97, 98 percent of the people in this country, from this country.
0782	TRUMP	I'm very proud of it.
0783	TRUMP	You have a club in Palm Beach, Florida called the MaraLago Club, it's a very, very successful club.
0784	TRUMP	It has a very short season, it's called, the Season, and it goes from November until March.
0785	TRUMP	It's a few months, five months at the most.
0786	TRUMP	People don't want a shortterm job.
0787	TRUMP	They don't want  so, we will bring people in, and we will send the people out.
0788	TRUMP	All done legally, all done with the process that's...
0789	SYSTEM	[ bell ringing ]
0790	TRUMP	...approved by government in Palm Beach, or West Palm Beach.
0791	TRUMP	We bring people in, we bring them out.
0792	TRUMP	We want to hire as many Americans as we can, but they don't want parttime, very short parttime jobs.
0793	KELLY	Understood.
0794	KELLY	Thank you.
0795	RUBIO	That's not accurate.
0796	RUBIO	I'm sorry, Megyn, that's not accurate.
0797	RUBIO	That's my  there were at least 300 Americans that applied last year, none of them were hired.
0798	RUBIO	Some of them...
0799	TRUMP	... Wrong...
0800	RUBIO	... have been interviewed...
0801	TRUMP	... That's wrong.
0802	RUBIO	...
0803	RUBIO	They were not hired...
0804	TRUMP	... Wrong...
0805	RUBIO	... And, here's why he does it this way, let me explain why he
0806	SYSTEM	[ inaudible ]
0807	RUBIO	H2B...
0808	TRUMP	... Wrong...
0809	RUBIO	... Because when you bring them in this way, when you bring someone in on one of these visas they can't go work for anybody else.
0810	RUBIO	They either work for you or they have to go back home.
0811	RUBIO	You basically have them captive, so you don't have to worry about competing for higher wages with another hotel down the street.
0812	RUBIO	And, that's why you bring workers from abroad.
0813	RUBIO	You argue that you're here to fight on behalf of the American worker, but when you have chances to help the American worker...
0814	SYSTEM	[ bell ringing ]
0815	RUBIO	...but when you have chances to help the American workers, you're making your clothes overseas and you're hiring your workers from overseas.
0816	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0817	KELLY	Go ahead, sir.
0818	TRUMP	The  the  the other hotels during the season, they do the same thing.
0819	TRUMP	They take in a lot of people, because you can't get them.
0820	TRUMP	They take in a lot of people.
0821	TRUMP	Longterm employees, we don't do that, but shortterm employees, we have no choice but to do it, and other hotels in that very, very hot area.
0822	TRUMP	It is a very hot area.
0823	RUBIO	There were Americans in that hot area.
0824	TRUMP	It's very, very hard to get people.
0825	TRUMP	But other hotels do the exact same thing.
0826	TRUMP	And just so you understand, just again, this is a legal process.
0827	TRUMP	This is a procedure.
0828	TRUMP	It's part of the law.
0829	TRUMP	I take advantage of that.
0830	TRUMP	There's nothing wrong with it.
0831	TRUMP	We have no choice.
0832	KELLY	All right.
0833	CRUZ	Donald, you could resolve this issue very quickly by simply...
0834	SYSTEM	[ audience booing ]
0835	CRUZ	...releasing the New York Times tape.
0836	CRUZ	Because, listen, maybe it's right.
0837	TRUMP	This wasn't on the subject.
0838	CRUZ	... that you didn't tell them you're misleading the American people.
0839	CRUZ	If that's the case...
0840	TRUMP	Tapes were not on the subject, but that's...
0841	CRUZ	If you didn't tell them that, the tapes will prove you're innocent.
0842	KELLY	OK.
0843	CRUZ	But if, in fact, you went to Manhattan and said I'm lying to the American people, then the voters have a right to know.
0844	TRUMP	No, no.
0845	TRUMP	You're the liar.
0846	TRUMP	You're the lying guy up here.
0847	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
0848	CRUZ	Because we've been lied to too many times.
0849	TRUMP	You're the  you're the one.
0850	TRUMP	You're the one.
0851	CRUZ	Why don't you release the tapes?
0852	CRUZ	Release the tapes.
0853	TRUMP	You're the one.

0861	KELLY	All right.

0863	SYSTEM	[ audience booing ]
0864	KELLY	Let's leave it at that.
0865	KELLY	We have more to get to.
0866	SYSTEM	[ audience booing ]
0867	BAIER	Gentlemen, the next topic to discuss is terrorism.
0868	BAIER	Senator Rubio, ISIS is a big topic of conversation on Facebook.
0869	BAIER	We have a map that shows the conservation about ISIS around the country.
0870	BAIER	You proposed sending a larger number of American ground troops to help defeat ISIS in Syria and Iraq...
0871	RUBIO	That's correct, and Libya.
0872	BAIER	... but military commanders say the biggest ISIS threat to Europe in particular now is coming from Libya, not Syria.
0873	RUBIO	Correct.
0874	BAIER	So just to be clear, if you're for putting more U.S. ground troops in Iraq and Syria, are you also ready to send U.S. ground troops on the ground in Libya?
0875	RUBIO	Well, Bret, what I've argued from the very beginning is ISIS  in order to defeat ISIS, you must deny them operating spaces.
0876	RUBIO	This is how ISIS or any radical group, for that matter, can grow.
0877	RUBIO	It's how Al Qaida was able to carry out 911, is that the Taliban gave them an operating space in Afghanistan.
0878	RUBIO	Today that operating space has largely been based in Iraq and Syria, but I've been warning about the Libyan presence for the better part of two years.
0879	RUBIO	So they need to be targeted wherever they have an operating space.
0880	RUBIO	They do need to be defeated on the ground by a ground force made up primarily of Sunni Arabs themselves.
0881	RUBIO	This is a radical Sunni movement.
0882	RUBIO	They can only be defeated if they are driven out and the territory is held by Sunni Arabs.
0883	RUBIO	But it will require a specific number of American special operators, in combination with an increase in air strikes.
0884	RUBIO	And that will include, if necessary, operating spaces in Libya, which, in fact, they are using to project into the Sinai against Egypt and ultimately into Europe, as well.
0885	BAIER	Governor Kasich, would you put ground troops in Libya?
0886	KASICH	Well, first of all, just to be clear, not only did I serve for 18 years on the Defense Committee, more than anybody on this stage, but, secondly, I was called into the Pentagon after 911 to help Secretary Rumsfeld with some of his difficulties.
0887	KASICH	I will say, look, let me tell you what happened with Libya.
0888	KASICH	And I pointed out in the last debate  Hillary Clinton worked aggressively to depose Moammar Gadhafi.
0889	KASICH	We had no business doing it.
0890	KASICH	He was working with us.
0891	KASICH	He was cooperating with us.
0892	KASICH	He denuclearized.
0893	KASICH	And now they pushed him out, and now we have a fertile ground for ISIS.
0894	KASICH	Fortunately in Libya, there's only a few cities on the coast, because most of Libya is a desert.
0895	KASICH	The fact of the matter is, we absolutely have to be  and not just with special forces.
0896	KASICH	I mean, that's not going to work.
0897	KASICH	Come on.
0898	KASICH	You've got to go back to the invasion when we pushed Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait.
0899	KASICH	We have to be there on the ground in significant numbers.
0900	KASICH	We do have to include our Muslim Arab friends to work with us on that.
0901	KASICH	And we have to be in the air.
0902	KASICH	And we  it should be a broad coalition, made up of the kinds of people that were involved when we defeated Saddam.
0903	KASICH	Now, you've got to be on the ground and in the air both in Syria and Iraq.
0904	KASICH	And at some point, we will have to deal with Libya.
0905	KASICH	I am very concerned about ISIS getting their hands on the oilfields in Libya and being able to fund their operations.
0906	KASICH	The fact is cool, calm, deliberate, effective, take care of the job, and then come home.
0907	KASICH	That's what we need to do with our military foreign policy.
0908	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0909	BAIER	Mr. Trump, just yesterday, almost 100 foreign policy experts signed on to an open letter refusing to support you, saying your embracing expansive use of torture is inexcusable.
0910	BAIER	General Michael Hayden, former CIA director, NSA director, and other experts have said that when you asked the U.S. military to carry out some of your campaign promises, specifically targeting terrorists' families, and also the use of interrogation methods more extreme than waterboarding, the military will refuse because they've been trained to turn down and refuse illegal orders.
0911	BAIER	So what would you do, as commanderinchief, if the U.S. military refused to carry out those orders?
0912	TRUMP	They won't refuse.
0913	TRUMP	They're not going to refuse me.
0914	TRUMP	Believe me.
0915	BAIER	But they're illegal.
0916	TRUMP	Let me just tell you, you look at the Middle East.
0917	TRUMP	They're chopping off heads.
0918	TRUMP	They're chopping off the heads of Christians and anybody else that happens to be in the way.
0919	TRUMP	They're drowning people in steel cages.
0920	TRUMP	And he  now we're talking about waterboarding.
0921	TRUMP	This really started with Ted, a question was asked of Ted last  two debates ago about waterboarding.
0922	TRUMP	And Ted was, you know, having a hard time with that question, to be totally honest with you.
0923	TRUMP	They then came to me, what do you think of waterboarding?
0924	TRUMP	I said it's fine.
0925	TRUMP	And if we want to go stronger, I'd go stronger, too, because, frankly...
0926	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0927	TRUMP	...that's the way I feel.
0928	TRUMP	Can you imagine  can you imagine these people, these animals over in the Middle East, that chop off heads, sitting around talking and seeing that we're having a hard problem with waterboarding?
0929	TRUMP	We should go for waterboarding and we should go tougher than waterboarding.
0930	TRUMP	That's my opinion.
0931	BAIER	But targeting terrorists' families?
0932	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0933	TRUMP	And  and  and  I'm a leader.
0934	TRUMP	I'm a leader.
0935	TRUMP	I've always been a leader.
0936	TRUMP	I've never had any problem leading people.
0937	TRUMP	If I say do it, they're going to do it.
0938	TRUMP	That's what leadership is all about.
0939	BAIER	Even targeting terrorists' families?
0940	TRUMP	Well, look, you know, when a family flies into the World Trade Center, a man flies into the World Trade Center, and his family gets sent back to where they were going  and I think most of you know where they went  and, by the way, it wasn't Iraq  but they went back to a certain territory, they knew what was happening.
0941	TRUMP	The wife knew exactly what was happening.
0942	TRUMP	They left two days early, with respect to the World Trade Center, and they went back to where they went, and they watched their husband on television flying into the World Trade Center, flying into the Pentagon, and probably trying to fly into the White House, except we had some very, very brave souls on that third plane.
0943	TRUMP	All right?
0944	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0945	BAIER	Senator Cruz, you were mentioned.
0946	TRUMP	I have no problem with it.
0947	BAIER	Senator Cruz?
0948	CRUZ	Bret, you know, I think the American people understand that yelling and cursing at people doesn't make you a tough guy.
0949	CRUZ	We need a commanderinchief that, number one, will rebuild the military, just like Ronald Reagan did in 1981 coming out of the weak Jimmy Carter administration.
0950	CRUZ	He passed tax reform and regulatory reform.
0951	CRUZ	The economy took off.
0952	CRUZ	It generated millions in highpaying jobs, trillions in new revenue.
0953	CRUZ	He rebuilt the military, bankrupted the Soviet Union, and won the Cold War.
0954	CRUZ	As president, I will do the exact same thing with radical Islamic terrorism.
0955	CRUZ	We will rebuild this military so that it remains the mightiest fighting force on the face of the planet.
0956	CRUZ	And then, when I am commanderinchief, every militant on the face of the Earth will understand that if they go and join ISIS, if they wage jihad against the United States of America, they are signing their death warrant.
0957	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0958	BAIER	But, Senator Cruz, in 2013, you said you were open  you were open to the possibility that Edward Snowden had performed a considerable public service, you said back then, in revealing certain aspects of the NSA procedures.
0959	BAIER	Many of your colleagues in the Senate, including Senator Rubio, called him a traitor.
0960	BAIER	It took you until January of this year to call him a traitor and say he should be tried for treason.
0961	BAIER	Why the change of heart?
0962	BAIER	And why did it take you so long?
0963	CRUZ	Well, Bret, as someone who spent much of his life in law enforcement, I believe you should start with the facts and evidence first before ending up with the verdict.
0964	CRUZ	When the news first broke of the United States government engaging in massive surveillance on American citizens, that was a very troubling development, and it's why the United States Congress acted to correct it.
0965	CRUZ	Now, at the same time, I said in that initial statement that if the evidence indicated that Edward Snowden violated the law, he should be prosecuted for violating the law.
0966	CRUZ	And, indeed, since then, the evidence is clear that not only does Snowden violate the law, but it appears he committed treason.
0967	CRUZ	Treason is defined under the Constitution as giving aid and comfort to the enemies of America, and what Snowden did made it easier for terrorists to avoid detection.
0968	CRUZ	And Snowden's comments afterwards, and his behavior afterwards, he fled to Russia, he fled to China.
0969	CRUZ	His conducts afterwards indicates that he was not a whistleblower, but instead he was undermining the ability to defend this country.
0970	CRUZ	But we need a president who isn't rash, who doesn't just pop off at the  at the hip, but waits to see what the facts are and then acts to defend this country.
0971	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
0972	BAIER	Mr. Trump, you've repeatedly deflected calls for specific national security or defense policy plans with the claim that you'll ask the best people when you become president, and take their advice.
0973	BAIER	So who are the best people?
0974	BAIER	Can you reveal two or three names that you trust for national security?
0975	TRUMP	I think Richard Haass is excellent.
0976	TRUMP	I have a lot of respect for him.
0977	TRUMP	I think General Keane is excellent.
0978	TRUMP	I think that there are  I like Colonel Jacobs very much.
0979	TRUMP	I see him.
0980	TRUMP	I know him.
0981	TRUMP	I have many people that I think are really excellent but in the end it's going to be my decision.
0982	TRUMP	When you just asked the question about Snowden, I will tell you right from the beginning, I said he was a spy and we should get him back.
0983	TRUMP	And if Russia respected our country, they would have sent him back immediately, but he was a spy.
0984	TRUMP	It didn't take me a long time to figure that one out.
0985	TRUMP	Believe me.
0986	TRUMP	But I would get the best people, people that I'd be comfortable with.
0987	TRUMP	And we will do the right thing.
0988	KASICH	Bret, it's very interesting to note, I think it's for the good of the record here that they took a survey of foreign policy magazines, 700 foreign policy experts, who would be the best person to conduct foreign policy of all the candidates in the race?
0989	KASICH	I received 55 percent of the vote.
0990	KASICH	Jeb Bush received 30 percent of the vote.
0991	KASICH	And everybody else, none of them made double digits.
0992	KASICH	And that's because you have to have the experience.
0993	KASICH	And you know, we hear about Ronald Reagan rebuilding the military.
0994	KASICH	I was there when Ronald Reagan rebuilt the military.
0995	KASICH	I worked with him.
0996	KASICH	I was there when Ronald Reagan rebuilt the economy.
0997	KASICH	I was there, and I worked with him.
0998	KASICH	I knew Ronald Reagan.
0999	KASICH	And I'll leave it right there with what comes after that.
1000	KASICH	You can figure that one out.
1001	BAIER	Governor Kasich, thank you.
1002	KELLY	We're going to have more questions for the candidates right after this break.

1006	BAIER	Let's get right back to the questions.
1007	KELLY	Mr. Trump, one of the things people love about you is they believe you tell it like it is.
1008	KELLY	But time and time again in this campaign, you have actually told the voters one thing only to reverse yourself within weeks or even sometimes days.
1009	KELLY	We've teed up just three examples in a videotape, similar to those we used with Senator Rubio and Senator Cruz in the last debate.
1010	KELLY	The first is on whether the war in Afghanistan was a mistake.
1011	KELLY	Watch.
1012	SYSTEM	[ begin video clip ]
1013	CUOMO	What about in Afghanistan?
1014	CUOMO	Do you believe that American boots should stay on the ground in Afghanistan to stabilize the situation?
1015	TRUMP	We've made a terrible mistake getting involved there in the first place.
1016	TRUMP	That thing will collapse about two seconds after they leave.
1017	TRUMP	Just as I said that Iraq was going to collapse after we leave.
1018	CUOMO	About Afghanistan, you said we made a terrible mistake getting involved there in the first place.
1019	TRUMP	We made a mistake going into Iraq.
1020	TRUMP	I've never said we made a mistake...
1021	CUOMO	Our question was about Afghanistan.
1022	CUOMO	That day on October...
1023	TRUMP	Well, OK, I never said that.
1024	CUOMO	... was on Afghanistan.
1025	TRUMP	OK. Wouldn't matter.
1026	TRUMP	I never said it.
1027	SYSTEM	[ end video clip ]
1028	KELLY	Next, on whether we should accept...
1029	TRUMP	Should I respond to that first?
1030	KELLY	Two more, and then you'll have the floor.
1031	KELLY	Next on whether we should accept the Syrian refugees...
1032	TRUMP	You'll be here a long time.
1033	KELLY	On whether we should accept the Syrian refugees.
1034	SYSTEM	[ begin video clip ]
1035	O'REILLY	Do you object to migrants who are getting out of the Middle East and North Africa?
1036	O'REILLY	Do you object to them coming to the USA?
1037	TRUMP	I hate the concept of it, but on a humanitarian basis, with what's happening, you have to.
1038	TRUMP	It's living in Hell in Syria there's no question about it.
1039	TRUMP	They're living in Hell.
1040	HANNITY	Are you saying absolutely people from Syria, the Middle East, should we allow any of them into this country?
1041	TRUMP	Look, from a humanitarian standpoint, I'd love to help, but we have our own problems.
1042	TRUMP	We have so many problems that we have to solve.
1043	SYSTEM	[ end video clip ]
1044	KELLY	Most recently, on whether President George W. Bush lied to get us into the Iraq war.
1045	SYSTEM	[ begin video clip ]
1046	TRUMP	They lied.
1047	TRUMP	They said there were weapons of mass destruction there were none.
1048	TRUMP	And they knew there were none.
1049	TRUMP	I don't know if he lied or not.
1050	TRUMP	He could have lied.
1051	TRUMP	Maybe he did.
1052	TRUMP	Maybe he didn't.
1053	TRUMP	I guess you'd have to ask him.
1054	SYSTEM	[ end video clip ]
1055	KELLY	And there are many other examples.
1056	KELLY	So how is any of this "telling it like it is"?
1057	TRUMP	Well, on Afghanistan, I did mean Iraq.
1058	TRUMP	I think you have to stay in Afghanistan for a while, because of the fact that you're right next to Pakistan, which has nuclear weapons, and we have to protect that.
1059	TRUMP	Nuclear weapons change the game.
1060	TRUMP	And I was always against going into Iraq.
1061	TRUMP	In fact, I  believe me, I was always against it.
1062	TRUMP	There was some cases where I sort of  in one interview with a great friend of mine, and yours, Howard Stern  said that  said that...
1063	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
1064	TRUMP	I said very meekly, long before we went in, I said very meekly, well, maybe, maybe, I don't know.
1065	TRUMP	By the time it got to that point, I was always against Iraq.
1066	TRUMP	But Afghanistan, I felt  and in that one, if you notice, I corrected it the second day.
1067	TRUMP	OK?
1068	TRUMP	Second question?
1069	KELLY	There are several examples, Mr. Trump.
1070	TRUMP	No, no.
1071	TRUMP	But...
1072	KELLY	We went through the Afghanistan being a mistake.
1073	KELLY	Within one day, you reversed yourself on Syrian refugees.
1074	TRUMP	Now on  let me explain that.
1075	TRUMP	You're right.
1076	TRUMP	Let me explain.
1077	TRUMP	First time the question had been put to me, it was very early on.
1078	TRUMP	The migration had just started.
1079	TRUMP	And I had heard that the number was a very, very small number.
1080	TRUMP	By the second day, two or three days later, I heard the number was going to be thousands and thousands of people.
1081	TRUMP	You know, when they originally heard about it, they were talking about bringing very, very small numbers in.
1082	TRUMP	And I said, begrudgingly, well, I guess maybe that's OK.
1083	TRUMP	It was not like, "Let's bring them in," because I think we should build a safe zone in  we should really  what we should be doing is building safe zones so they can stay in their own country and not go all over, and at least this way we're not going to have the problem.
1084	TRUMP	That's what we have to do.
1085	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1086	TRUMP	But just  just to set  because I fully understand what you're asking.
1087	TRUMP	When I first heard the question, first time the question was ever asked to me, first time I really had known about the question, the migration had just started.
1088	TRUMP	I was very much like, OK, by the time I went back and studied it, and they were talking about bringing thousands and thousands, I changed my tune.
1089	TRUMP	And I don't think there's anything wrong with that.
1090	KELLY	But the point I'm going for is you change your tune on so many things, and that has some people saying, what is his core?
1091	TRUMP	Megyn, I have a very strong core.
1092	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1093	TRUMP	I have a very strong core.
1094	TRUMP	But I've never seen a successful person who wasn't flexible, who didn't have a certain degree of flexibility.
1095	TRUMP	You have to have a certain degree of flexibility.
1096	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1097	TRUMP	You can't  for instance, let's say, on  on the second question, you can't say it's OK, and then you find out it's not OK, and you don't want to do anything.
1098	TRUMP	You have to be flexible, because you learn.
1099	TRUMP	I mean, before I knew the question was asked by Bill, and the next day, or the couple of days later, the question was asked by, by  you know  I was asked by a number of people, actually.
1100	TRUMP	I was asked by Sean, but I was asked by a number of people.
1101	TRUMP	But by that time, the number had increased significantly.
1102	KELLY	Sean was the next day after Bill.
1103	TRUMP	The next day.
1104	TRUMP	But I had learned.
1105	TRUMP	I mean, nobody had ever asked me the question.
1106	TRUMP	This was brand new.
1107	TRUMP	But  and I really mean it.
1108	TRUMP	You have to show a degree of flexibility.
1109	TRUMP	If you're going to be one way and you think it's wrong, does that mean the rest of your life you have to go in the wrong direction because you don't want to change?
1110	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1111	KASICH	Megyn.
1112	SYSTEM	[ inaudible ]
1113	KELLY	Go ahead, Governor.
1114	KASICH	I did 200 meetings in New Hampshire, I don't know how many in Michigan now.
1115	KASICH	In these townhalls people come in and they're very emotional meetings.
1116	KASICH	And, you know what they really want to know?
1117	KASICH	If somebody tells them something, can they believe it?
1118	KASICH	And, the reason why people are so upset in this country is because politicians all the time tell them what they want to hear.
1119	KASICH	And, they go to Washington, or they go to the state capital, wherever, and they don't deliver on those promises.
1120	KASICH	You know, when I ran for Governor of Ohio, I said not only would we balance the budget, but we would cut taxes.
1121	KASICH	People said that can't be done.
1122	KASICH	I wouldn't have said it if I didn't believe it.
1123	KASICH	We cut taxes in Ohio more than any governor in the country, and $5 billion dollars worth of tax cuts  we're not running a surplus in Ohio.
1124	KASICH	But, you see, what's getting in the hearts and souls of the people is they want change, and they keep putting outsiders in to bring about the change, then the change doesn't come.
1125	KASICH	Then they put more outsiders in because we're putting people in that don't understand compromise.
1126	KASICH	They don't understand policy...[
1127	KASICH	bell ringing ]
1128	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1129	KASICH	...They're getting more and more frustrated with the system which is why we must pick somebody that has a record of achievement, not just talk.
1130	KELLY	OK.
1131	KASICH	Not just talk, but a record of achievement.
1132	KASICH	That's how we'll restore credibility..
1133	RUBIO	...
1134	RUBIO	This isn't just about flexibility.
1135	KELLY	Go ahead, Senator.
1136	RUBIO	There's a difference between flexibility and telling people whatever you think you need to say to get them to do what you want them to do.
1137	SYSTEM	[ cheering ]
1138	RUBIO	And, that's what Donald has done throughout his career.
1139	SYSTEM	[ inaudible ]
1140	RUBIO	Well, he did, and that's why Trump University...
1141	TRUMP	... That's not right...
1142	RUBIO	... Is so relevant here.
1143	RUBIO	I saw this video last week where he's sitting in front of a camera saying we're going to hire the best people, and I'm going to hand pick them.
1144	RUBIO	There are going to be hand picked and instructors, the best instructors in the world.
1145	RUBIO	One of them, but the way, was the manager at a Buffalo Wild Wing.
1146	RUBIO	And, that's who they hired to do this, and people borrowed money, and they signed up for this fake university.
1147	RUBIO	And, these people owe all this money now, and they got nothing in return for it, but you are willing to say whatever you had to say...
1148	SYSTEM	[ bell ringing ]
1149	RUBIO	...to get them to give you their money...
1150	KELLY	... Go ahead, Mr. Trump...
1151	TRUMP	... We'll find out when we have the
1152	SYSTEM	[ inaudible ]
1153	TRUMP	...
1154	RUBIO	... And, we're not going to do that to our country...
1155	TRUMP	... And, by the way, just so you understand...
1156	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1157	TRUMP	...this is a case I could have settled very easily, but I don't settle cases very easily when I'm right.
1158	TRUMP	Ninetyeight percent approval rating, we have an "A" from the Better Business Bureau...
1159	RUBIO	... That's false...
1160	TRUMP	... We have a 98 percent approval rating from the people who took the course.
1161	TRUMP	We have an "A" from the Better Business Bureau.
1162	TRUMP	And, people like it.
1163	TRUMP	Now, he's saying they didn't learn.
1164	TRUMP	We have many, many people that will be witnesses.
1165	TRUMP	Again, I don't settle cases.
1166	TRUMP	I don't do it because that's why I don't get sued very often, because I don't settle, unlike a lot of other people.
1167	TRUMP	We have a situation where we will win in court...
1168	SYSTEM	[ bell ringing ]
1169	TRUMP	...But, many of the people that are witnesses did tremendously well, and made a lot of money...
1170	RUBIO	... That's false...
1171	TRUMP	... By taking the course.
1172	KELLY	Go ahead, Senator.
1173	TRUMP	You're going to see, you don't know...
1174	RUBIO	...
1175	RUBIO	The Better Business Bureau gave it a "D" minus.
1176	TRUMP	You're going to see, you're going to see.
1177	KELLY	...
1178	KELLY	It's Senator Rubio's turn...
1179	TRUMP	... No, no.
1180	TRUMP	Before they had the information...
1181	RUBIO	... Go on my website, Marco Rubio.com...
1182	TRUMP	... Before they had the information...
1183	KELLY	...
1184	KELLY	Senator Rubio, standby, let him finish his point, and then I'll give you the floor...
1185	TRUMP	... Before they had the information it got  it is right now an "A", once they had the information...
1186	RUBIO	...
1187	SYSTEM	[ inaudible ]
1188	RUBIO	this anymore.
1189	TRUMP	...
1190	TRUMP	The only reason that is was a "D" was because we didn't care  we didn't give them the information...
1191	RUBIO	... A third of the people
1192	SYSTEM	[ inaudible ]
1193	RUBIO	...
1194	TRUMP	...
1195	TRUMP	When they got the information it became an "A"...
1196	KELLY	... With respect  wait.
1197	KELLY	With respect...
1198	TRUMP	... Marco you don't know
1199	SYSTEM	[ inaudible ]
1200	TRUMP	...
1201	KELLY	... With respect, we went back and looked at this...
1202	TRUMP	...
1203	TRUMP	Yes.
1204	KELLY	The rating from the Better Business Bureau was a "D" minus...
1205	SYSTEM	[ cheering and applause ]
1206	TRUMP	...
1207	SYSTEM	[ inaudible ]
1208	KELLY	... that's the last publicly available rating in 2010, and it was the result of a number of complaints they had...
1209	TRUMP	...
1210	TRUMP	But it was elevated to an "A"...
1211	SYSTEM	[ inaudible ]
1212	KELLY	... That's never been publicly available.
1213	TRUMP	...
1214	TRUMP	I can give it to you.
1215	TRUMP	I can give it to you tomorrow..
1216	KELLY	... Let's just bring the viewers up to speed, let's just bring the viewers up to speed.
1217	TRUMP	...
1218	TRUMP	It was elevated to an "A".
1219	KELLY	Let me just set the record, and then you guys can have at it.
1220	KELLY	There was Trump University, which was a business that you started, and it was marketed...
1221	TRUMP	... Small business...
1222	KELLY	... to many people, and now there is a classaction of over 5,000 plaintiffs against you, Mr. Trump...
1223	TRUMP	...
1224	TRUMP	Right...
1225	KELLY	... And, it involves veterans, and it involves teachers, and it involves socalled little guys, working class, and lower working class and middle class who say that they were fleeced, who say that it was as scam.
1226	KELLY	The class has been certified, and in that case you countersued the lead plaintiff alleging that you were being defamed.
1227	KELLY	That case was thrown out against her...
1228	TRUMP	...
1229	TRUMP	The lead plaintiff is now getting out of the case because it's so bad for her...
1230	KELLY	...
1231	KELLY	But, what happened was...
1232	TRUMP	...
1233	TRUMP	Excuse me, the lead plaintiff signed a letter saying how great it was, and it on tape saying how great it was.
1234	KELLY	OK, no, but  standby.
1235	KELLY	But, what happened in that case was you countersued her.
1236	KELLY	The court threw out your countersuit, and made you pay almost $800,000 dollars in legal fees of hers, and you made the same argument about 98 percent of the people being happy with Trump University.
1237	KELLY	And, that woman in particular signing a survey saying she liked it while someone was standing over her shoulder...
1238	TRUMP	... She's trying to get out of the case.
1239	TRUMP	She's trying to get out of the case...
1240	KELLY	... And this is what  standby, this is what the Court of Appeals found.
1241	KELLY	They said that the plaintiffs against you are like the Madoff victims...
1242	TRUMP	Oh, give me a break...
1243	KELLY	...This is what the Court of Appeals said.
1244	TRUMP	Give me a break.
1245	KELLY	This is what the court of appeals said.
1246	TRUMP	Give me a break.
1247	KELLY	They found that victims of con artists often sing the praises of their victimizers until they realize they have been fleeced.
1248	TRUMP	You know what, let's see what happens in court.
1249	TRUMP	This is a civil case.
1250	TRUMP	Very easy to have settled.
1251	TRUMP	Could settle it now.
1252	TRUMP	Very easy to have settled.
1253	TRUMP	Let's see what happens at the end of a couple years when this case is over, OK?
1254	KELLY	It has been going for five years.
1255	TRUMP	Yes, it has been going for a long time.
1256	KELLY	Go ahead, Senator.
1257	RUBIO	I spoke to one of the victims yesterday.
1258	TRUMP	We'll win the case.
1259	RUBIO	I spoke to one of the victims yesterday.
1260	TRUMP	One, one of the victims.
1261	RUBIO	No, there are several.
1262	RUBIO	Obviously there are so many, I can't talk to them every day.
1263	RUBIO	I spoke to one of them, he told me exactly what happened.
1264	RUBIO	They signed up for this course because they believed Mr. Trump was this fantastic businessman, that Donald is going to teach them the tricks of the trade.
1265	RUBIO	They signed up.
1266	RUBIO	They paid $15,000 for this course.
1267	RUBIO	They were asked for additional money for this course.
1268	RUBIO	If they really wanted the real secrets of success, they had to pay even more money, and so they did.
1269	RUBIO	And you know what they got in these courses?
1270	RUBIO	Stuff you can pull off of Zillow.
1271	RUBIO	When they finally realized what a scam it was, they asked for their money back.
1272	RUBIO	And you refused to give them their money back.
1273	RUBIO	Why don't you tonight...
1274	TRUMP	I gave many people their money back.
1275	RUBIO	Then why don't you tonight say you're going to give the money back to everybody who wants...
1276	TRUMP	Let me just...
1277	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
1278	KELLY	OK.
1279	KELLY	Senator Rubio, let him answer.
1280	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
1281	KELLY	Let him answer.
1282	KELLY	Go ahead, Mr. Trump.
1283	TRUMP	We will see who's right at the end of a few years.
1284	TRUMP	But all of the  almost all of the people, many, many people signed what's called the report card at the end, did you like the course, how did you like it.
1285	TRUMP	Almost all of them said it was terrific, OK?
1286	TRUMP	With letters, with this.
1287	TRUMP	Some of them are on tape saying it was terrific.
1288	TRUMP	Let's see what happens at the end of three years.
1289	KELLY	With respect, Mr. Trump, onethird of the plaintiffs in that case demanded refunds.
1290	KELLY	So it's not the case that 98 percent were...
1291	TRUMP	I gave some refunds to people because if they asked for the refunds in a certain period of time, and we gave refunds to people.
1292	KELLY	OK.
1293	TRUMP	But let's see what happens at the end of three years.
1294	TRUMP	Let's see who's right.
1295	KELLY	Still a pending litigation.
1296	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
1297	TRUMP	It's called pending litigation.
1298	RUBIO	Megyn, this is why this is relevant to this election.
1299	KELLY	All right.
1300	KELLY	Senator Rubio then Senator Cruz.
1301	KELLY	Go ahead.
1302	RUBIO	This is why, because he's trying to do to the American voter what he did to the people that signed up for this course.
1303	RUBIO	He's making promises he has no intention of keeping.
1304	RUBIO	And it won't just be $36,000 that they lose, it's our country that's at stake here.
1305	RUBIO	The future of the United States and the most important election in a generation, and he's trying to con people into giving them their vote just like he conned these people into giving him their money.
1306	TRUMP	Let me tell you the real con artist.
1307	TRUMP	Excuse me.
1308	TRUMP	Excuse me.
1309	TRUMP	The real con artist is Senator Marco Rubio who was elected in Florida and who has the worst voting record in the United States Senate.
1310	TRUMP	He doesn't go to vote.
1311	TRUMP	He's absent.
1312	TRUMP	He doesn't go.
1313	TRUMP	Now, the people of Florida can't stand him.
1314	TRUMP	He couldn't get elected dogcatcher.
1315	TRUMP	The people of Florida  the people of Florida  and by the way, I know he's going to spend $25 million on ads.
1316	TRUMP	Without that he wouldn't have a chance.
1317	TRUMP	He's 20 points south.
1318	TRUMP	The people in Florida wouldn't elect him dogcatcher.
1319	TRUMP	He couldn't get any  he's right now 21 points down to me.
1320	TRUMP	And, you know...
1321	KELLY	OK.
1322	TRUMP	... again, there will be a lot of advertising.
1323	TRUMP	It's the only thing that might save him.
1324	TRUMP	But I doubt it.
1325	RUBIO	Notice that's not an answer.
1326	KELLY	I'm coming to you next.
1327	KELLY	But go ahead.
1328	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
1329	TRUMP	He scammed the people of Florida.
1330	TRUMP	He scammed people.
1331	TRUMP	He doesn't vote.
1332	TRUMP	He doesn't show up for the U.S. Senate.
1333	TRUMP	He doesn't vote.
1334	TRUMP	He scammed the people.
1335	TRUMP	He defrauded the people of Florida.
1336	KELLY	With respect, you've made that point.
1337	KELLY	Go ahead.
1338	RUBIO	There's no  as you can see in his answer, it's always the same thing.
1339	TRUMP	You defrauded the people of Florida, little Marco.
1340	RUBIO	He has defrauding people out of things, and not just  and not just, by the way, on the issue of Trump University.
1341	RUBIO	He had another development in Mexico that he had nothing to do with except his name on the building.
1342	RUBIO	People put money into that building.
1343	TRUMP	That was licensing.
1344	RUBIO	They lost their money.
1345	RUBIO	Yes, licensing, but you told them you owned the building.
1346	RUBIO	So they gave him his money.
1347	RUBIO	They lost their money.
1348	RUBIO	Time and again...
1349	KELLY	All right.
1350	KELLY	Stand by.
1351	KELLY	I will come back to you.
1352	KELLY	Senator Cruz wants to weigh in.
1353	KELLY	You're coming back.
1354	KELLY	Go ahead.
1355	CRUZ	Megyn, let me ask the voters at home, is this the debate you want playing out in the general election?
1356	CRUZ	The stakes in this election are too high.
1357	CRUZ	For seven years, millions of Americans, we've been struggling, wages have been stagnating, people are hurting, our constitutional rights are under assault.
1358	CRUZ	And if we nominate Donald, we're going to spend the spring, the fall, and the summer with the Republican nominee facing a fraud trial...
1359	TRUMP	Oh, stop it.
1360	CRUZ	... with Hillary Clinton saying...
1361	TRUMP	It's just a minor case.
1362	TRUMP	It's a minor case.
1363	CRUZ	... why did you give my campaign and my foundation $100,000?
1364	TRUMP	It's a minor civil case.
1365	CRUZ	And with Hillary Clinton...
1366	TRUMP	Give me a break.
1367	CRUZ	... pointing out that he supported her four times in her presidential race.
1368	TRUMP	It's a minor civil case.
1369	CRUZ	Donald, learn not to interrupt.
1370	CRUZ	It's not complicated.
1371	TRUMP	There are many, many civil cases.
1372	CRUZ	Count to 10, Donald.
1373	CRUZ	Count to 10.
1374	TRUMP	Give me a break.
1375	CRUZ	Count to 10.
1376	CRUZ	The stakes are too high and if you are one of the 65 to 70 percent of Republicans who recognize that nominating Donald would be a disaster, then I ask you to come join us.
1377	CRUZ	If you're supporting other candidates, come join us.
1378	CRUZ	We welcome you to our team because we've demonstrated not once, not twice, not three times, but five separate times we have beat Donald.
1379	CRUZ	And if you don't want him to be the nominee, then I ask you to stand with us as a broad coalition of people who believe in the Constitution, believe in freedom, and want to turn this country around.
1380	KELLY	Go ahead, Mr. Trump.
1381	TRUMP	I don't believe these politicians.
1382	TRUMP	All talk, no action.
1383	TRUMP	I'm standing here listening to  I'm hearing him say about a percentage.
1384	TRUMP	CNN, he gets 15.
1385	TRUMP	That means 85 percent, based on what you're saying, of the people don't dig you, number one, number one.
1386	TRUMP	Is that a correct statement?
1387	TRUMP	How do you get  are you at 15 in the new CNN poll?
1388	TRUMP	Do you believe in CNN?
1389	TRUMP	I mean, I know we're with FOX.
1390	TRUMP	But CNN spent  CNN...
1391	CRUZ	All right, I'll respond...
1392	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
1393	TRUMP	CNN spent a lot of money on a poll, just came out.
1394	TRUMP	I'm at 49.
1395	TRUMP	He's at 15.
1396	TRUMP	He tells me about 65 percent of the people.
1397	TRUMP	It's not 65 percent of the people.
1398	TRUMP	If you go by that, 85 percent of the people.
1399	TRUMP	Then he goes, we have five.
1400	TRUMP	And  well, excuse me, I won 10.
1401	TRUMP	I won 10 states.
1402	TRUMP	If you listen to him, it's like  I won 10 states.
1403	TRUMP	Everybody knows that on Super Tuesday Trump was the winner.
1404	TRUMP	There wasn't one person that didn't say that.
1405	TRUMP	Even the two people on your left and right said we did a great job.
1406	TRUMP	So how does he take  how does he take five and say it's better than 10?
1407	KELLY	Go ahead, Senator.
1408	TRUMP	I am by far the leader.
1409	TRUMP	But if you listen to a politician, he'll try and convince you otherwise.
1410	KELLY	Senator Cruz, go.
1411	CRUZ	All right, well, Donald lives by the polls every day.
1412	CRUZ	He tweets about the polls.
1413	TRUMP	No, I don't.
1414	TRUMP	No, I don't.
1415	CRUZ	He's told us to look to the CNN poll.
1416	CRUZ	Well, that's a very good poll to look to, because that CNN poll showed that head to head Donald Trump loses to Hillary Clinton by 8 points.
1417	CRUZ	He doesn't just lose close he loses by 8 points.
1418	CRUZ	That same poll he told you to look at shows me beating Hillary Clinton.
1419	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1420	CRUZ	We cannot mess this up.
1421	CRUZ	And, by the way, the last four polls in a row, when you nominate a candidate who literally has been on every side of every issue, and in the course of this debate may be on two other sides before we're done, that's not how you win.
1422	CRUZ	And the stakes are too high.
1423	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
1424	KELLY	All right.
1425	KELLY	I'm going to let Mr. Trump  I'm going to let  let me just...
1426	TRUMP	According to your poll...
1427	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
1428	KELLY	I'm going to let you respond to that, Mr. Trump.
1429	KELLY	I'm going to then go to you, Governor.
1430	KELLY	You're up next.
1431	TRUMP	...
1432	TRUMP	I know, but your recent polls have me beating Hillary Clinton, and very, very easily.
1433	KELLY	OK. Do you want to weigh in?
1434	KASICH	All right, look, honestly, when I see people at these meetings, these town halls, where we take massive questions, and I get to spend time with them.
1435	KASICH	Last night, there was a woman that came to tell me about the loss of her 15yearold son, who took his own life.
1436	KASICH	See, there's people in this country  and Ted's right  their wages haven't gone up for so long, they see the rich get richer, they believe, and they're not moving.
1437	KASICH	And they put their money in the bank, and they got no interest on their money.
1438	KASICH	They receive none.
1439	KASICH	And their sons or daughters are living in the basement because they can't get a good job after they rang up so much college debt.
1440	KASICH	What people are hungry for is, who can fix this?
1441	KASICH	People want to know who  what can you do to solve the problems in Washington, to make sure that we have stronger job growth and better wages?
1442	KASICH	But you know what else they're yearning for?
1443	KASICH	They want to believe that they have the power to fix things where they live, and they want the power back, so they can begin to do things in their community.
1444	KASICH	Now, listen, this has been going on for a long time here.
1445	KASICH	And I appreciate the discussion back and forth.
1446	KASICH	But there are a lot of people out there yearning for somebody who's going to bring America back, both at the leadership level and in the neighborhood, where we can begin to reignite the spirit of the United States of America.
1447	KASICH	And let's stop fighting.
1448	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1449	KELLY	Governor, thank you.
1450	KELLY	Gentlemen, thank you.
1451	WALLACE	Much more to come live from the Fox Theater, including where the candidates stand on the social issues facing the country.
1452	WALLACE	The Republican presidential debate continues in a moment.
1453	SYSTEM	[ commercial break ]
1454	KELLY	Welcome back, everybody, to the Fox News Republican presidential debate.
1455	KELLY	We want to get right back to the questions.
1456	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1457	BAIER	We are here in Detroit.
1458	BAIER	The top issues in Michigan, according to Facebook, are displayed in a word cloud you're taking a look at.
1459	BAIER	The second biggest issue is clean water.
1460	BAIER	That, of course, is directly tied with the situation in Flint.
1461	BAIER	Senator Rubio, Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton have both been to Flint.
1462	BAIER	They are both running ads in this state focusing on that, focusing on supporting Flint and fixing the problems, showing images of people in Flint thankful that they're there.
1463	BAIER	Without getting into the political blame game here, where are the national Republicans' plans on infrastructure and solving problems like this?
1464	BAIER	If you talk to people in this state, they are really concerned about Flint on both sides of the aisle.
1465	BAIER	So why haven't GOP candidates done more or talked more about this?
1466	RUBIO	Well, I know I've talked about it, and others in our campaign have talked about it, and other candidates have talked about it, as well.
1467	RUBIO	What happened in Flint was a terrible thing.
1468	RUBIO	It was systemic breakdown at every level of government, at both the federal and partially the  both the state and partially at the federal level, as well.
1469	RUBIO	And by the way, the politicizing of it I think is unfair, because I don't think that someone woke up one morning and said, "Let's figure out how to poison the water system to hurt someone."
1470	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1471	RUBIO	But accountability is important.
1472	RUBIO	I will say, I give the governor credit.
1473	RUBIO	He took responsibility for what happened.
1474	RUBIO	And he's talked about people being held accountable...
1475	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1476	RUBIO	...and the need for change, with Governor Snyder.
1477	RUBIO	But here's the point.
1478	RUBIO	This should not be a partisan issue.
1479	RUBIO	The way the Democrats have tried to turn this into a partisan issue, that somehow Republicans woke up in the morning and decided, "Oh, it's a good idea to poison some kids with lead."
1480	RUBIO	It's absurd.
1481	RUBIO	It's outrageous.
1482	RUBIO	It isn't true.
1483	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1484	RUBIO	All of us are outraged by what happened.
1485	RUBIO	And we should work together to solve it.
1486	RUBIO	And there is a proper role for the government to play at the federal level, in helping local communities to respond to a catastrophe of this kind, not just to deal with the people that have been impacted by it, but to ensure that something like this never happens again.
1487	BAIER	Thank you, Senator.
1488	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1489	KELLY	Governor Kasich, the city of Detroit has long suffered with urban blight, broken street lights, dilapidated and vacant houses, and so on.
1490	KELLY	In 2013, Detroit actually declared bankruptcy, which helped, but the schools here remain a big problem.
1491	KELLY	They're $3.5 billion in debt and are some of the most troubled and poorly testing in the country.
1492	KELLY	The kids too often go to classrooms that are unsafe, falling apart, infested with rodents and insects.
1493	KELLY	Experts say the schools could go bankrupt by next month.
1494	KELLY	Question to you.
1495	KELLY	If the federal government bailed out the auto industry here in Detroit, should it also bail out the Detroit schools?
1496	KASICH	Well, look, first of all, I think the mayor now is controlling the schools.
1497	KASICH	This is not much different than what happened in Cleveland, Ohio, where the AfricanAmerican Democrat mayor, the union, and business leaders came to see me and said, "Would you help us to pass legislation to really create a CEO environment so that we can take control of the schools?"
1498	KASICH	We even invested in a buyout plan, where we bought out the teachers who had been there a long time, because there were so many young teachers who had been laid off who were so enthusiastic to get back in the schools.
1499	KASICH	It worked beautifully.
1500	KASICH	Cleveland's coming back.
1501	KASICH	The Cleveland schools are coming back because of a major overhaul.
1502	KASICH	It's the same thing that has to happen in all of our urban schools.
1503	KASICH	And, frankly, look, if I were president, I'd take 104 federal programs, bundle them into four buckets, and send it to the states, because fixing schools rests at the state and the local level, and particularly at the school board level.
1504	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1505	KASICH	Now, I also believe  I also believe that you need to introduce vocational education in those schools.
1506	KASICH	You need mentoring in those schools.
1507	KASICH	And you need to have a situation where people can have an alternative forum to get a degree.
1508	KASICH	And you need school choice, both vouchers and charter schools.
1509	KASICH	All of those things can come together to help, Megyn.
1510	KASICH	But here's the bottom line.
1511	KASICH	And I'll go quickly.
1512	KASICH	We as adults have to fight in our neighborhoods, in our communities, for our children's education.
1513	KASICH	Put the politics aside, and everyone in this room can play a role in lifting their schools and lifting the students who are in those schools, because too much politics gets in the middle of it, and where we focus as adults, and put children first, we see tremendous results.
1514	KASICH	And the people of this town are going to rise.
1515	KASICH	And they need to be involved.
1516	KASICH	Thank you.
1517	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1518	WALLACE	For  for half a century, as you all know, Detroit was the symbol of America's industrial might 300,000 manufacturing jobs in this city.
1519	WALLACE	At last count, there are now fewer than 30,000 manufacturing jobs here, and the unemployment rate in this city is 11 percent, twice the national average.
1520	WALLACE	Senator Cruz, I know that you have general plans for tax reform, but what specifically would you do to bring manufacturing jobs back to America and train residents of cities like Detroit to do those jobs?
1521	CRUZ	Well, Chris, thank you for that question.
1522	CRUZ	Let me start by observing that Detroit is a great city with a magnificent legacy that has been utterly decimated by 60 years of failed leftwing policy.
1523	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1524	CRUZ	You know, Henry Ford revolutionized automobile manufacturing and brought automobiles to the middle class.
1525	CRUZ	During World War II, Detroit provided  funded the arsenals of democracy to help us win World War II.
1526	CRUZ	In  in the 1960s, Detroit was the Silicon Valley of America.
1527	CRUZ	It had a population of 2 million people, had the highest per capita income in the country.
1528	CRUZ	And then, for 50 years, leftwing Democrats have pursued destructive tax policies, weak crime policies, and have driven the citizens out.
1529	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1530	CRUZ	This city now has just 700,000 citizens.
1531	CRUZ	There are vacant homes, one after the other after the other.
1532	CRUZ	Crime has been rampant, and it is an outrage.
1533	CRUZ	And let me say to folks in the media That is a story that the media ought to be telling over and over again, the destruction of leftwing policies and the millions who have hurt because of it.
1534	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1535	WALLACE	Well, I was going to say, I'll give you 30 seconds to try to answer my question.
1536	WALLACE	What specifically would you do to bring manufacturing jobs back to Detroit and to train the residents here to do those jobs?
1537	CRUZ	The way you bring manufacturing back to America is, number one, you lift the regulations.
1538	CRUZ	As president, I will repeal Obamacare, the biggest jobkiller in America.
1539	CRUZ	I will pull back the federal regulators, the EPA and all the regulators that are killing small businesses and manufacturing.
1540	CRUZ	And my tax plan, which is a very, very detailed plan on the website, tedcruz.org, is what's called border adjustable.
1541	CRUZ	We get rid of all the taxes.
1542	CRUZ	We get rid of the corporate income tax and the death tax and the Obamacare taxes and the payroll tax.
1543	CRUZ	And we replace it with a 16 percent business flat tax that is border adjustable, which means all exports are entirely taxfree and all imports pay the 16 percent business flat tax.
1544	CRUZ	That's a 32 percent differential.
1545	CRUZ	What that will do, Chris, is bring millions of manufacturing jobs back to this country, bring the steel industry back to this country, create an environment where when we compete on a fair and level playing field, American ingenuity can beat anyone.
1546	CRUZ	But right now, the federal government isn't giving us a level playing field.
1547	WALLACE	Thank you, Senator.
1548	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1549	BAIER	Gentlemen, the next series of questions will be on social issues.
1550	BAIER	Governor Kasich, the last debate, you were asked a question about religious liberty, in a hypothetical situation where a samesex couple approaches a cupcake maker to do their wedding.
1551	BAIER	Here's what you said.
1552	SYSTEM	[ begin video clip ]
1553	KASICH	If you're in the business of selling things, if you're not going to sell to somebody you don't agree with, today I'm not going to sell to somebody who's gay, then tomorrow maybe I won't sell to somebody who's divorced.
1554	SYSTEM	[ end video clip ]
1555	BAIER	Governor, some faith leaders got nervous about that answer.
1556	BAIER	Do gay marriage dissenters have rights?
1557	KASICH	Well, look, first of all, I try to be a man of faith every day as best as I can, and I try to focus in my faith on the dos and I think the don'ts will take care of themselves once I get the dos right, which is humility, and loving my enemy, and caring for my neighbor.
1558	KASICH	But secondly, look, you're in the commerce business, you want to sell somebody a cupcake, great.
1559	KASICH	OK?
1560	KASICH	But now if they ask you to participate in something you really don't like, that's a whole 'nother issue, OK?
1561	KASICH	Another issue.
1562	KASICH	Here's what I'd like to see happen.
1563	KASICH	The Supreme Court ruled, I don't agree with the ruling.
1564	KASICH	I'm of favor of marriage between  you know, traditional marriage, a man and a woman.
1565	KASICH	What I hope was going to happen after the Supreme Court ruling is things would settle down.
1566	KASICH	If you go to a photographer to take pictures at your wedding, and he says, I'd rather not do it, find another photographer, don't sue them in court.
1567	KASICH	You know what, the problem is in our country  in our country, we need to learn to respect each other and be a little bit more tolerant for one another.
1568	KASICH	And at the end of the day, don't go to court.
1569	KASICH	Can't we have common sense in America?
1570	KASICH	That's the way it used to be.
1571	KASICH	And there was a book written called "The Death of Common Sense."
1572	KASICH	We need to bring it back.
1573	KASICH	But at the end of the day, if somebody is being pressured to participate in something that is against their deeplyheld religious beliefs, then we're going to have to think about dealing with the law.
1574	KASICH	But you know what, I'd rather people figure this out without having to put another law on the books and have more arguments in this country.
1575	KASICH	Why don't we come together as a country, respect one another, love one another and lift this country?
1576	KASICH	I think that's what people want.
1577	KASICH	So thanks for asking.
1578	BAIER	Senator Cruz, the U.S. Supreme Court obviously declared samesex marriage legal in all 50 states, a decision you have criticized.
1579	BAIER	Given the current status of the law, do you believe a gay couple should be able to adopt?
1580	CRUZ	Well, listen, adoption is decided at the state level and I am a believer in the 10th Amendment in the Constitution, I would leave the question of marriage to the states, I would leave the question of adoption to the states.
1581	CRUZ	That's the way it has been for two centuries of our nation's history until five unelected judges in an illegitimate and wrong decision decided to seize the authority over marriage and wrongfully tear down the marriage laws of all 50 states.
1582	CRUZ	Now, interconnected to this is the question of religious liberty.
1583	CRUZ	And at the last debate, one of my colleagues on this stage said on the question of religious liberty and Supreme Court nominees that he'd be willing to compromise and negotiate.
1584	CRUZ	I can tell you, for me, there are areas that we should compromise on.
1585	CRUZ	Marginal tax rates, we can reach a middle ground on.
1586	CRUZ	But when it comes to core principles and convictions, when it comes to the Constitution and Bill of Rights, I can tell the men and women at home I will never compromise away your religious liberty.
1587	CRUZ	And for me, Bret, religious liberty has been a lifelong passion.
1588	CRUZ	I've spent two decades defending religious liberty, including defending the Ten Commandments before the U.S. Supreme Court and winning.
1589	CRUZ	Defending the Pledge of Allegiance before the Supreme Court and winning.
1590	CRUZ	And defending the Mojave Desert Veterans Memorial, a lone white Latin cross that was erected to honor the men and women who gave their lives in World War I. I represented 3 million veterans for free defending that memorial and we won 54 before the Supreme Court.
1591	BAIER	Senator, thank you.
1592	BAIER	Senator Cruz definitely avoided saying your name, Mr. Trump, but I think he was referring to you and your religious liberty answer.
1593	BAIER	Would you like to respond?
1594	TRUMP	I have nothing to say.
1595	TRUMP	I mean, generally speaking, agree with what he said.
1596	TRUMP	I would have certainly have rather left it to the states.
1597	TRUMP	I was always in favor  I was very surprised when they came up with that decision.
1598	TRUMP	I would have certainly  I would have preferred had it been left to the states and I think most people would have preferred that.
1599	BAIER	Senator Rubio, the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, a conservative icon, obviously, pointed out, in the United States versus Heller, that like most rights, the Second Amendment right is not unlimited.
1600	BAIER	Just like the First Amendment doesn't allow you to go into a theater and yell fire, he said the Second Amendment leaves room to regulate guns.
1601	BAIER	So do you agree with Justice Scalia?
1602	BAIER	And if so, what limits would you draw around the Second Amendment?
1603	RUBIO	As few as possible.
1604	RUBIO	The Second Amendment, as I've said before, is not a suggestion.
1605	RUBIO	It is the constitutional right of every American to protect themselves and their families.
1606	RUBIO	It is a right that  it is the Second Amendment for a reason.
1607	RUBIO	It is right after the defense of the freedom of speech for a reason, for clearly the founders of our nation understood and the framers of the Constitution understood that you cannot have life and you cannot have liberty and cannot pursue happiness if you are not safe.
1608	RUBIO	And the Second Amendment  when people talk about gun laws, what they need to realize is, criminals don't follow gun laws.
1609	RUBIO	They're criminals.
1610	RUBIO	By definition, they ignore the law.
1611	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1612	RUBIO	But the gun rights of Americans, if you are talking to a law abiding citizen and a gunowner like myself, if you pass a law, I will follow whatever the law is.
1613	RUBIO	A criminal will not do it.
1614	RUBIO	They will continue to pursue these guns on the black market, where they then go out and commit crimes and they steal guns from each other.
1615	RUBIO	Gun laws are not effective.
1616	RUBIO	They simply do not provide for safety.
1617	RUBIO	But they do, however, ensure that lawabiding people don't have access to weapons to protect themselves and guns to protect themselves, but criminals always will be well armed.
1618	RUBIO	They don't care about the law they don't follow the law.
1619	RUBIO	We will protect the Second Amendment when I'm president of the United States.
1620	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1621	BAIER	Mr. Trump, you were once a supporter of an assault weapons ban.
1622	BAIER	So do you think there should be any restrictions on the Second Amendment?
1623	TRUMP	No, I'm a big defender of the Second Amendment.
1624	TRUMP	And if you look at what's happened, whether it's in California, where you had the 14 people killed, whether it's in Paris  which, by the way, has the toughest gun laws in the world and 130 people killed.
1625	TRUMP	Many, many people in the hospital gravely injured.
1626	TRUMP	They will be dying.
1627	TRUMP	Many people will be dying in addition.
1628	TRUMP	If we had guns, or if they had guns on the other side of the room, with the bullets going in the opposite direction, you would not have had 130 people killed.
1629	TRUMP	That I can tell you right now.
1630	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1631	TRUMP	So I'm a very, very big supporter of the Second Amendment.
1632	BAIER	But in 2000, you wrote in your book, "I generally oppose gun control, but I support the ban on assault weapons."
1633	TRUMP	I don't support it anymore.
1634	TRUMP	I do not support the ban on assault.
1635	SYSTEM	[ audience booing ]
1636	BAIER	Senator Cruz?
1637	BAIER	Any limits to the Second Amendment?
1638	CRUZ	Well, listen, unlike Donald, I would not support banning firearms.
1639	CRUZ	In that instance, Bill Clinton banned many of the most popular firearms in America.
1640	CRUZ	And by the way, the study showed that ban did nothing to reduce violent crime.
1641	CRUZ	It just took away the Second Amendment rights of lawabiding citizens.
1642	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1643	CRUZ	And let me point out, you know, it is easy for political candidates to have rhetoric and say, "I support the Second Amendment."
1644	CRUZ	But you cannot say that and at the same time say what Donald just said, which is that on the question of Supreme Court nominees he wants to compromise and reach a middle ground with Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer.
1645	CRUZ	That's what he said in the last debate.
1646	TRUMP	I  I did not say that.
1647	TRUMP	I did not say that.
1648	CRUZ	And any justice that Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer sign off on...
1649	TRUMP	I did not say that.
1650	CRUZ	And I would point out, Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer are both Democrats that Mr. Trump has written checks to repeatedly.
1651	CRUZ	Any justice that those two sign off on is going to be a leftwing judicial activist who will undermine religious liberty, and we are one vote away from the Heller decision being overturned, which would effectively erase the Second Amendment from the Bill of Rights.
1652	CRUZ	If you care about the Second Amendment, then you need to ask who on this stage do you know will appoint principled constitutionalists to the court and not cut a deal with your Second Amendment rights?
1653	BAIER	Mr. Trump...
1654	TRUMP	So we're listening to the alltalk, noaction politician, and he was the primary supporter of John Roberts, who gave us Obamacare.
1655	CRUZ	That's flatout wrong.
1656	TRUMP	No, it's not.
1657	TRUMP	You take a look.
1658	TRUMP	He was the primary supporter.
1659	TRUMP	He pushed John Roberts, and pushed him, and pushed him, and Bush ultimately appointed him.
1660	TRUMP	He got appointed.
1661	TRUMP	And when it came his time to raise his hand and kill Obamacare, not once, but twice, he let us down, and he did the wrong thing.
1662	TRUMP	This is the man that was the primary supporter.
1663	TRUMP	And you can read law journal, you can read whatever you want to read  I've read plenty of it.
1664	TRUMP	There was no stronger supporter of John Roberts than him.
1665	TRUMP	And it was a very, very big mistake.
1666	BAIER	Quickly, Senator Cruz.
1667	CRUZ	You know, Donald has a tenuous relationship with the truth.
1668	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
1669	CRUZ	I wrote one oped supporting President Bush's nomination after he made it.
1670	CRUZ	I would not have made that nomination.
1671	CRUZ	But let me point out...
1672	TRUMP	Not what you say in the oped.
1673	CRUZ	... if Donald actually cared about...
1674	TRUMP	That is not what you said in the oped.
1675	CRUZ	But, Donald, please, I know it's hard not to interrupt.
1676	CRUZ	But try.
1677	TRUMP	Yeah, I know it is.
1678	TRUMP	But it's not what you said in the oped.
1679	CRUZ	Breathe, breathe, breathe.
1680	TRUMP	Lyin' Ted.
1681	CRUZ	You can do it.
1682	CRUZ	You can breathe.
1683	CRUZ	I know it's hard.
1684	CRUZ	I know it's hard.
1685	CRUZ	But just...
1686	RUBIO	When they're done with the yoga, can I answer a question?
1687	CRUZ	You cannot.
1688	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
1689	RUBIO	Unbelievable.
1690	CRUZ	I really hope that we don't  we don't see yoga on this stage.
1691	RUBIO	Well, he's very flexible, so you never know.
1692	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1693	CRUZ	But you cannot, in fact, care about conservative Supreme Court justices and support Jimmy Carter for president.
1694	CRUZ	You cannot care about conservative Supreme Court justices and support John Kerry for president, as Donald did.
1695	CRUZ	You cannot care about conservative Supreme Court justices and support Harry Reid for Senate majority leader.
1696	CRUZ	And you cannot care about conservative Supreme Court justices and write four checks to Hillary Clinton for her to be president if you care at all about the Second Amendment or religious liberty or anything else.
1697	BAIER	Gentlemen, gentlemen, we're going to move on.
1698	BAIER	Thank you very much.
1699	BAIER	We want to talk about some more policy questions coming up.
1700	WALLACE	And coming up, the candidates tackle foreign policy.
1701	WALLACE	But first, during the commercial break, join us for a Facebook live on the Fox News Facebook page and tell us what you think about tonight's debate in the comments section.
1702	WALLACE	Stay with us.
1703	WALLACE	More to come.
1704	SYSTEM	[ commercial break ]
1705	KELLY	Welcome back, everybody.
1706	KELLY	We're going it get right back to the questions.
1707	WALLACE	And gentlemen, we're going to focus for a bit now on foreign policy.
1708	WALLACE	Senator Rubio, you like to take a shot at Mr. Trump on the campaign trail saying that negotiating a hotel deal in a foreign country is not foreign policy.
1709	WALLACE	The other day you even compared him to Kim Jongun, the North Korean leader, as lunatics trying to get a hold of nuclear weapons.
1710	WALLACE	Please tell Mr. Trump why he's unprepared to be commanderin chief.
1711	RUBIO	Well, first of all, I think, as we've seen throughout this campaign, Donald has not shown a seriousness about the issues of foreign policy.
1712	RUBIO	He just simply hasn't.
1713	RUBIO	Whether it was the structure of our military, even today he was asked a question about the issue of commanders not following his lead on killing the family of terrorists.
1714	RUBIO	And his answer basically was, if I tell them to do it, they're going to do it.
1715	RUBIO	Now that's just not true.
1716	RUBIO	Foreign policy is not only consequential, I think much of our future now depends on it.
1717	RUBIO	You know, I see a lot of young people at my events around the country.
1718	RUBIO	I feel great when they come.
1719	RUBIO	And I always them that despite the hardships of the moment, I honestly believe that today's Millennials have a chance to be the greatest generation we've had in 100 years.
1720	RUBIO	I really do.
1721	RUBIO	Because the world today has hundreds of millions of people that can afford to be their clients, their customers, their partners, people they collaborate with.
1722	RUBIO	But that won't happen if the world is dangerous and it's unstable.
1723	RUBIO	And that will require strong American leadership.
1724	RUBIO	The next president of the United States is going to have eight years of a mess of a foreign policy to clean up.
1725	RUBIO	That's why it can't be Hillary Clinton.
1726	RUBIO	And quite frankly, that's why it can't be someone who simply has not shown the intellectual curiosity or the interest in learning about these very complicated issues.
1727	RUBIO	And Donald simply hasn't.
1728	WALLACE	Mr. Trump, your response.
1729	TRUMP	Well, let me just say this.
1730	TRUMP	I've gotten to know Marco over a period of time, believe me, he is not a leader.
1731	TRUMP	Believe me.
1732	RUBIO	But that doesn't answer the question.
1733	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
1734	WALLACE	He didn't interrupt you.
1735	WALLACE	Let him talk.
1736	TRUMP	He didn't answer  he's not a leader.
1737	TRUMP	And, frankly, when I say they'll do as I tell them, they'll do as I tell them.
1738	TRUMP	And that's very  it's very simple.
1739	TRUMP	It's very simple.
1740	TRUMP	We are in a very dangerous place.
1741	TRUMP	We have a depleted military.
1742	TRUMP	Totally depleted.
1743	TRUMP	We have  by the way, our vets are treated horribly.
1744	TRUMP	We're going to take care of our vets.
1745	TRUMP	We're going to start taking care of our vets, properly, like we should.
1746	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1747	TRUMP	But we're going to build up our military, and we're going to get the equipment we want, not the equipment that's sold to us by somebody that gave him and him and not the governor campaign contributions.
1748	TRUMP	OK?
1749	TRUMP	We're going to get the equipment that the generals and the soldiers want.
1750	TRUMP	I will prove to be a great leader.
1751	TRUMP	And, you know, it's very interesting, we talk about the polls.
1752	TRUMP	Every single poll when it comes to ISIS and the military and the border say, by far, Trump is the best.
1753	WALLACE	Mr. Trump, your time is up.
1754	RUBIO	Yeah, I just want to  a couple points.
1755	RUBIO	Once again, he was pressed on a policy issue to show his understanding of the foreign policy, and his reaction was just to attack somebody else with a name.
1756	RUBIO	Here's the bottom line.
1757	RUBIO	And I'm going to repeat it again.
1758	RUBIO	The world today is as complicated and as complex as it has been certainly in a very  certainly in the lifetime of anybody here today.
1759	RUBIO	You indeed do have a lunatic in North Korea with nuclear weapons.
1760	RUBIO	You indeed do have the Chinese government taking over the most important shipping lane in the world.
1761	RUBIO	And Vladimir Putin, who you've expressed admiration for, Donald...
1762	TRUMP	Wrong.
1763	TRUMP	Wrong.
1764	RUBIO	You've expressed admiration for him.
1765	TRUMP	Wrong.
1766	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
1767	RUBIO	Donald, you said he's a strong leader.
1768	TRUMP	Wrong.
1769	RUBIO	He is now dividing Europe up...
1770	TRUMP	He said very good things about me, and I said...
1771	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
1772	RUBIO	All right, I'm going to finish my statement here.
1773	TRUMP	Yeah, finish.
1774	RUBIO	And he's also sowing instability in the Middle East.
1775	RUBIO	You have Iran who's going to get $100 billion of sanctions relief.
1776	RUBIO	You have radical jihadists spreading all over the world.
1777	RUBIO	This is a time for seriousness on these issues.
1778	RUBIO	You have yet to answer a single serious question about any of this.
1779	RUBIO	Will you give us a detailed answer about foreign policy any time you're asked on it?
1780	TRUMP	Let me just tell you, first of all, I've been hearing this man so long talking about Putin.
1781	TRUMP	Putin said about me  I didn't say about Putin  Putin said very nice things about me.
1782	TRUMP	And I say very nicely, wouldn't it be nice if actually we could get along with Russia, we could get along with foreign countries, instead of spending trillions and trillions of dollars?
1783	TRUMP	You're talking about Flint, Michigan.
1784	TRUMP	You're talking about places  we need to rebuild the infrastructure of our country.
1785	TRUMP	Wouldn't it be nice if we got along with the world, and maybe Russia could help us in our quest to get rid of ISIS, et cetera, et cetera?
1786	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
1787	WALLACE	Gentlemen, you both have had a chance to talk.
1788	WALLACE	You both have had a chance to talk a couple of times.
1789	WALLACE	I'd like to move on to Senator Cruz.
1790	WALLACE	Senator, we have some breaking news tonight.
1791	WALLACE	North Korea's dictator, Kim Jongun, has ordered that country's nuclear weapons to be made ready at a moment's notice.
1792	CRUZ	Yes.
1793	CRUZ	Yes.
1794	WALLACE	And this comes just hours after the U.N. Security Council announced that  approved the toughest sanctions in two decades against that country.
1795	WALLACE	Assume you're President Cruz tonight.
1796	WALLACE	What do you do?
1797	CRUZ	Well, you're right, the news is very disturbing that Kim Jongun has put their nuclear weapons on ready state.
1798	CRUZ	I'm glad that we're sending another carrier group to the South China Sea.
1799	CRUZ	I'm glad that Congress passed sanctions on North Korea.
1800	CRUZ	But this is all the result of the failures of the Clinton administration two decades ago that negotiated a deal with North Korea lifting the sanctions, allowing billions of dollars to flow in, and they used that money to develop nuclear weapons in the first place.
1801	CRUZ	What we  now we're in a much harder position.
1802	CRUZ	When you have a lunatic with nuclear weapons, to some extent, it constrains your options.
1803	CRUZ	We need to be moving the carrier  carrier group to the South China Seas.
1804	CRUZ	We  we need to be putting in place missile defense, such as the THAAD missile defense system in South Korea.
1805	CRUZ	We need to be pursuing spacebased missile defense.
1806	CRUZ	One of the advantages of spacebased missile defense is that if you have a missile launch in North Korea or you have a missile launch in Iran, a spacebased missile defense can take out one or two or three missiles before it can cross over and do damage.
1807	CRUZ	And we also need to be putting pressure on China, because North Korea is effectively a  a client state of China.
1808	CRUZ	All of that will happen with a strong commanderinchief that is devoted to keeping this country safe.
1809	WALLACE	Thank you, Senator.
1810	WALLACE	Governor Kasich, I want to move back to the debate that we heard earlier about Vladimir Putin.
1811	WALLACE	In December, after Vladimir Putin had some nice thing to say about Donald Trump, calling him bright and talented, your campaign ran a video suggesting that Trump might name the Russian president as his running mate.
1812	WALLACE	Here's a clip.
1813	KASICH	I'll have to see this.
1814	SYSTEM	[ begin video clip ]
1815	UNKNOWN	If elected, Trump promised that the dictatorial duo would, quote, "make tyranny great again."
1816	TRUMP	I think I'd get along very well with Vladimir Putin.
1817	TRUMP	I just think so.
1818	TRUMP	[
1819	TRUMP	end video clip ]
1820	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
1821	WALLACE	That was your campaign video, sir.
1822	KASICH	That was a pretty good one.
1823	WALLACE	Well, OK.
1824	KASICH	No, I...
1825	SYSTEM	[ crosstalk ]
1826	WALLACE	If I may  sir, if I may ask my question...
1827	KASICH	Of course.
1828	WALLACE	I think you were kidding.
1829	WALLACE	But it was your video and the serious question is, because the suggestion is, do you think that Donald Trump is naive about the threat that Vladimir Putin represents?
1830	KASICH	I'm not biting.
1831	KASICH	Let me take you around the world, OK?
1832	KASICH	Let me  look, I'm going to take you very quickly.
1833	KASICH	In Russia, we need to tell them we're going to arm the Ukrainians with defensive lethal weapons.
1834	KASICH	And we're going to tell Putin if you attack anybody in Eastern Europe in NATO, you attack Finland and Sweden, which is not in NATO, consider it an attack on us.
1835	KASICH	And he will understand that.
1836	KASICH	Secondly, I would tell the Chinese you don't own the South China Sea.
1837	KASICH	Stop hacking us.
1838	KASICH	And we're going to beef up our cyber command.
1839	KASICH	And we're going to be in a position to be able to take out your systems if you continue to do this.
1840	KASICH	Now let's move over into the Middle East.
1841	KASICH	The Egyptians, they know they're on their last legs there because of the attack from ISIS.
1842	KASICH	The Jordanians are  really have been our friends.
1843	KASICH	They know that they are at risk.
1844	KASICH	So do the Saudis.
1845	KASICH	So do the Gulf states.
1846	KASICH	They are our allies, really, or have similar aims, we need to bring them closer to us.
1847	KASICH	Turkey a critical avenue to the Middle East.
1848	KASICH	We have to bring them towards the West, and not towards the East.
1849	WALLACE	Governor...
1850	KASICH	And we have a joint, good human intelligence.
1851	KASICH	That is called a semitrip around the world.
1852	KASICH	And if you gave me more time, I'd finish the trip.
1853	WALLACE	Governor, thank you.
1854	KASICH	Thank you.
1855	BAIER	Coming up, a final question and closing statements.
1856	BAIER	And take a look at this.
1857	BAIER	The volume of conversation on Facebook surrounding the remaining candidates over the last month.
1858	BAIER	Whether that conversation is good or bad, Donald Trump clearly dominates the field.
1859	BAIER	We'll be back with more of the Republican presidential debate live from Detroit.
1860	SYSTEM	[ commercial break ]
1861	BAIER	Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate.
1862	BAIER	Let's get back at it.
1863	BAIER	Gentlemen, this is the last question of the night.
1864	BAIER	It has been a long time since our first debate, seven months ago in Cleveland.
1865	BAIER	A lot has transpired since then, obviously, including an RNC pledge that all of you signed agreeing to support the party's nominee and not to launch an independent run.
1866	BAIER	Tonight, in 30 seconds, can you definitively say you will support the Republican nominee, even if that nominee is Donald J. Trump?
1867	BAIER	Senator Rubio, yes or no?
1868	RUBIO	I'll support the Republican nominee.
1869	BAIER	Mr. Trump?
1870	BAIER	Yes or no?
1871	RUBIO	I'll support Donald if he's the Republican nominee, and let me tell you why.
1872	RUBIO	Because the Democrats have two people left in the race.
1873	RUBIO	One of them is a socialist.
1874	RUBIO	America doesn't want to be a socialist country.
1875	RUBIO	If you want to be a socialist country, then move to a socialist country.
1876	RUBIO	The other one is under FBI investigation.
1877	RUBIO	And not only is she under FBI investigation, she lied to the families of the victims of Benghazi, and anyone who lies to the families of victims who lost their lives in the service of our country can never be the commander inchief of the United States.
1878	BAIER	Senator...
1879	RUBIO	We must defeat Hillary Clinton.
1880	BAIER	Senator Cruz, yes or no, you will support Donald Trump is he's the nominee?
1881	CRUZ	Yes, because I gave my word that I would.
1882	CRUZ	And what I have endeavored to do every day in the Senate is do what I said I would do.
1883	CRUZ	You know, just on Tuesday, we saw an overwhelming victory in the state of Texas where I won Texas by 17 percent.
1884	CRUZ	And I will say it was a powerful affirmation that the people who know me best, the people who I campaigned, who made promises that if you elect me, I'll lead the fight against Obamacare, I'll lead the fight against amnesty, I'll lead the fight against our debt, and I will fight for the Bill of Rights and your rights every day, that the people of Texas said you have kept your word, and that's what I'll do as president.
1885	BAIER	Governor Kasich, yes or no, would you support Donald Trump as the Republican nominee?
1886	KASICH	Yeah.
1887	KASICH	But  and I kind of think that, before it's all said and done, I'll be the nominee.
1888	KASICH	But let me also say...
1889	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1890	KASICH	But let me also say, remember...
1891	BAIER	But your answer is yes?
1892	KASICH	But I'm the little engine that can.
1893	KASICH	And, yeah, look, when you're in the arena, and we're in the arena.
1894	KASICH	And the people out here watching  we're in the arena, we're traveling, we're working, we spend time away from our family, when you're in the arena, you enter a special circle.
1895	KASICH	And you want to respect the people that you're in the arena with.
1896	KASICH	So if he ends up as the nominee  sometimes, he makes it a little bit hard  but, you know, I will support whoever is the Republican nominee for president.
1897	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1898	WALLACE	Mr. Trump, I'm going to ask you a version of the same question.
1899	WALLACE	As we saw today with Mitt Romney, the #NeverTrump movement is gaining steam.
1900	WALLACE	Some people are talking about contributing millions of dollars to try to stop you.
1901	WALLACE	Again today, you raised the possibility that you might run as an independent if you feel you're treated unfairly by the Republican Party.
1902	WALLACE	So I'm going to phrase the question that the other three people on this stage just got.
1903	WALLACE	Can you definitively say tonight that you will definitely support the Republican nominee for president, even if it's not you?
1904	TRUMP	Even if it's not me?
1905	SYSTEM	[ laughter ]
1906	TRUMP	Let me just start off by saying...
1907	WALLACE	Thirty seconds, sir.
1908	TRUMP	... OK  that I'm very, very proud of  millions and millions of people have come to the Republican Party over the last little while.
1909	TRUMP	They've come to the Republican Party.
1910	TRUMP	And by the way, the Democrats are losing people.
1911	TRUMP	This is a trend that's taking place.
1912	TRUMP	It's the biggest thing happening in politics, and I'm very proud to be a part of it.
1913	TRUMP	And I'm going to give them some credit, too, even though they don't deserve it.
1914	TRUMP	But the answer is Yes, I will.
1915	WALLACE	Yes, you will support the nominee of the party?
1916	TRUMP	Yes, I will.
1917	TRUMP	Yes.
1918	TRUMP	I will.
1919	KELLY	Candidates, it's now time for your closing statements.
1920	KELLY	Governor Kasich, we'll start with you.
1921	KASICH	Well, ladies and gentlemen, I love being here in Michigan, and I want to say to all of you here that I have a record of being able to solve some of the biggest problems.
1922	KASICH	It's not just talk, and it's not theory.
1923	KASICH	I did it in Washington by helping people get into a healthier economic situation.
1924	KASICH	I've done it in Ohio.
1925	KASICH	And as we've made progress in Ohio, we've left no one behind.
1926	KASICH	We've not left behind the mentally ill, the drug addicted, the working poor, the developmental disabled, and we have raised our minority community.
1927	KASICH	And as president of the United States, I will go back to Washington, I will take the formulas that I used, and I will  I will fix the problems in Washington, and you'll work with me as I send you power to fix your  your communities, your neighborhoods, your state, and together, we'll restore the spirit of America.
1928	KASICH	And I know you want that.
1929	KASICH	Thank you.
1930	SYSTEM	[ applause ]
1931	WALLACE	Senator Rubio, 30 seconds, closing statement.
1932	RUBIO	Well, I know this has been an unusual election cycle, as it continues, and there's a lot of problems in America, and people are truly hurting.
1933	RUBIO	But this election is not just about confronting our problems it's also about embracing our opportunities.
1934	RUBIO	I believe the 21st century holds the potential to be the greatest era in the history of the United States, if we get this election right and if we act now.
1935	RUBIO	If we do, if we do what needs to be done, we can leave our children as the freest and most prosperous Americans that have ever lived, and the 21st century can be the greatest era in the amazing story of America.
1936	RUBIO	So I ask everyone to vote for me and join our effort at marcorubio.com.

1939	CRUZ	I want to talk to every soldier and sailor and airman and Marine.
1940	CRUZ	I want to talk to every mom and dad and sister and brother and son and daughter of someone fighting for this country.
1941	CRUZ	For seven years, you've had a commanderinchief that doesn't believe in you, that sends you into combat with rules of engagement that tie your arms behind your back.
1942	CRUZ	That is wrong.
1943	CRUZ	It is immoral.
1944	CRUZ	And in January 2017, it will end.
1945	CRUZ	I want to also talk to all the police officers and firefighters and first responders who have been left behind with this president.
1946	CRUZ	Starting in January 2017, I will have your back.
