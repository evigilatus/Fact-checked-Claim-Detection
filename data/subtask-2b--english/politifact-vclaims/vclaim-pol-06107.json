John Kasich touted his economic record in the state.\nRepeating a claim he has often made -- including on his campaign website -- Kasich said, \"I took the state of Ohio from an $8 billion hole \u2026 to a $2 billion surplus.\"\nWe decided to take a closer look.\nAn $8 billion hole?\nThere\u2019s an argument for $8 billion, but there\u2019s also an argument for something closer to $6 billion, according to a deep dive by the Cleveland Plain Dealer in 2011.\nThe $8 billion figure is rounded up from a $7.7 billion gap between spending and expected revenues. It was an initial estimate from January 2011, based on the assumption made several months earlier that there would be no new revenue growth. However, revenues did grow as the economy rebounded that year, reducing the gap to between $5.9 billion to $6.1 billion -- a calculation that Kasich\u2019s budget director, Tim Keen, agreed with \"conceptually\" in a 2011 interview with the newspaper, though he took issue with some of the methodological details.\nWhatever the number, Kasich avoided a potential misstep when he spoke of this in the debate as a \"hole\" rather than a deficit, since Ohio, like most states, cannot run an actual budget deficit. The $8 billion gap is more accurately described as a projected shortfall rather than a deficit.\nA $2 billion surplus?\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis figure is clearer. The state\u2019s Office of Budget and Management reported in July 2015 that the state\u2019s \"rainy day fund\" had a little more than $2 billion in it, up from effectively zero when Kasich took office in 2011.\nDoes Kasich deserve credit?\nIt\u2019s not unreasonable to give Kasich some credit for the state\u2019s improving economic fortunes -- he is a governor, after all, and he forged the state\u2019s fiscal policy in concert with the Legislature.\nBut it\u2019s important to remember that he took office at the very beginning of the national economic recovery, and as the national economy has improved, so has Ohio\u2019s. When Kasich was inaugurated in January 2011, the unemployment rate in Ohio was 9.2 percent -- exactly the same as the national rate. Today, the national unemployment rate is 5.3 percent and the rate in Ohio is 5.2 percent. So Kasich\u2019s timing has been fortunate.\nOur ruling\nKasich said, \"I took the state of Ohio from an $8 billion hole \u2026 to a $2 billion surplus.\"\nIt\u2019s possible to argue over whether the initial amount should be $6 billion rather than $8 billion. But Kasich didn\u2019t pull that figure out of thin air, and it certainly was high by historical standards. He also used the term \"hole,\" which is more appropriate than \"deficit\" would have been. Meanwhile, the $2 billion figure seems solid. Still, it\u2019s worth noting that Kasich spoke a little grandly when he said that \"I\" did it, since the state\u2019s fiscal improvement got a big assist from the national economic recovery.\nThe statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06107"}
