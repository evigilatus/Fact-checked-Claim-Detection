Fox News host Greg Gutfeld brought up the case of Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass.\n\"Nothing will ever come close to Ted Kennedy meeting with the KGB in order to beat Ronald Reagan in 1984,\" Gutfeld said on his show July 15. \"It was a quid pro quo. You help the Dems. We help the USSR. If it worked, we would still have the USSR.\"\nAs Gutfeld spoke, a graphic appeared on the screen of a 2009 Forbes magazine article, \"Ted Kennedy\u2019s Soviet Gambit.\"\nThis isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve seen a claim like this, and it\u2019s not the first time this Kennedy-KGB story tracked back to that Forbes story.\nSo is it true?\nHardly.\nThere\u2019s not much to back up the tale under any circumstances, but Gutfeld went overboard even relative to the Forbes article. He said Kennedy met with the KGB, something the Forbes piece doesn\u2019t even mention.\nThe Forbes article describes a 1983 memo from Viktor Chebrikov, then head of the Soviet spy agency, to Yuri Andropov, the then-general secretary of the Communist Party. Chebrikov wrote that Kennedy\u2019s trusted friend John\u00a0Tunney, a former senator from California, had passed along Kennedy\u2019s interest in meeting with Andropov.\nSo even if you take the memo from KGB agent as gospel, there was no actual meeting between Kennedy and the KGB.\nBut what about the rest of the details and the memo? Was Kennedy looking to undermine Reagan? That\u2019s murkier than you might expect.\nStep back to 1983\nIn early 1983, Reagan\u2019s plan to place medium-range nuclear missiles in Western Europe generated great concern among voters in the West and also within the leadership of the USSR.\nThe KGB memo detailed a proposal, ostensibly from Kennedy via Tunney, to de-escalate tensions.\nThose steps included Andropov inviting Kennedy and Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., for a meeting in Moscow. The purpose \"would be to arm Soviet officials with explanations regarding problems of nuclear disarmament so they may be better prepared and more convincing during appearances in the USA.\" In addition, Kennedy\u2019s middleman suggested that Andropov come to the United States where he could do interviews on the big three broadcast networks and speak to the \"peaceful intentions of the USSR.\"\nAccording to the memo, Kennedy\u2019s goal was to \"root out the threat of nuclear war, and to improve Soviet-American relations, so that they define the safety of the world.\"\nThe memo does mention Kennedy\u2019s interest in the presidency, but the idea was for Kennedy to run in 1988. (Kennedy never ran and supported then-Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis.)\nThe memo said, \"Because he (Kennedy) formally refused to partake in the election campaign of 1984, his speeches would be taken without prejudice as they are not tied to any campaign promises. Tunney remarked that the senator wants to run for president in 1988.\"\nHaving served two terms, Reagan would not be on the ballot in 1988.\nTo believe or not believe the memo\nThe memo gained attention when it was the basis of a news report published in the London\u00a0Times\u00a0in 1992, after the Soviet Union dissolved. When the report came out, Tunney told the London\u00a0Times\u00a0that it was \"bull----.\" We reached Tunney in 2015, and he emphatically repeated that.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJake Tapper\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in remarks in a CNN broadcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second presidential impeachment of Donald Trump was \u201cthe most bipartisan impeachment in American history.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The idea that I would be handling contacts with Andropov is preposterous,\" Tunney said. \"This memo is completely false.\"\nAt the time, Tunney was a private businessman, but his friendship with Kennedy dated back to law school. He said that while he had made many trips to Moscow over the years and knew people in the KGB, the only political topic Kennedy ever asked him to broach with the Soviets was a deal to release dozens of dissidents. In exchange, Kennedy would make a speech at a university in one of the USSR\u2019s republics in Central Asia. That took place several years earlier.\nTunney said that some time after the memo emerged, Kennedy asked him if he knew anything about it, and Tunney said, \"this is crazy.\"\nIn 1992, a Boston Herald reporter reached Kennedy spokesman Paul Donovan. Donovan said Kennedy\u2019s office had made other efforts to meet with Andropov, but nothing ever came of it. According to the Herald, Donovan said, \"The rest of the memo is KGB fiction.\"\nDenials from anyone tied to Kennedy might be expected, but Kennedy does have a sort of character reference in the arena of foreign relations from a Reagan insider, the administration\u2019s disarmament negotiator Max Kampelman.\nIn his memoirs Entering New Worlds, Kampelman wrote that the Soviets liked working with Kennedy as a back-door conduit of information, and Kampelman welcomed the arrangement.\n\"I learned that the senator never acted or received information without informing the appropriate United States agency or\u00a0official,\" Kampelman wrote.\nIn 1985, Reagan himself approved using Kennedy this way, and a working relationship grew between Kampelman and Kennedy.\nWhile it is possible that the administration never caught wind of any contacts Tunney had with the KGB, it is worth noting that when the archivists at the Reagan Library searched the White House files on Kennedy, no episode involving the USSR in 1983 popped up.\nSmoke, but no fire?\nIn the Reagan years, Kenneth Adelman served as deputy U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. and then director of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. In 2015, we asked Adelman what he made of the KGB memo, and he dismissed it.\nHe had no idea if an overture might have been made, but even it had, Adelman said it didn\u2019t matter.\n\"We knew senators were doing this sort of thing all the time, and we ignored it,\" Adelman said. \"We didn\u2019t think it was important, and it wasn\u2019t. The administration didn\u2019t care about it.\"\nStephen Cohen, a political scientist at Princeton University and New York University, suggested that KGB memos shouldn\u2019t be taken at face value.\n\"As someone who has worked for years in once closed Soviet-era archives, I can tell you that many false documents can be found there,\" Cohen told PunditFact in 2015. \"As the saying goes, rubbish in, rubbish out.\"\nPaul Kengor, a political scientist at Grove City College who included the memo in his book about Reagan,\u00a0The Crudasder, takes the memo seriously.\n\"The memo is absolutely accurate,\" Kengor said. \"No question.\"\nIt is worth noting that the memo does not say how Tunney conveyed Kennedy's message beyond \"through confidential contacts.\" In other words, the memo's author was relying on someone else and not speaking from his own experience, which introduces another level of uncertainty.\nOur ruling\nGutfeld said that Kennedy met with the KGB in order to defeat Ronald Reagan in 1984. There is certainly evidence that Kennedy attempted to meet with Soviet officials, but it was with the approval of the Reagan White House.\nThe validity of a specific KGB memo saying Kennedy wanted to de-escalate tensions with Moscow over a U.S. plan to install nuclear missiles in Western Europe is widely questioned.\nBut more to the point, Gutfeld reached one conclusion that doesn\u2019t add up. There is no evidence of Kennedy \"meeting with the KGB.\" The evidence Gutfeld used on screen doesn\u2019t support that contention.\nWe rate this claim False.\n Share the Facts 2017-07-18 17:36:27 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  Says Ted Kennedy met \"with the KGB in order to beat Ronald Reagan in 1984.\"    Greg Gutfeld Fox News host   On a broadcast of the Greg Gutfeld Show Saturday, July 15, 2017 2017-07-15    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03098"}
