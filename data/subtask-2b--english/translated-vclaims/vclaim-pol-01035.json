One recent story came out of her participation in a Facebook group called \"The Persian Resistance Movement: Updates and News from the trenches.\" It was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We found that the article misleads readers about information about the possible negative side effects of MMR vaccine, which is used against measles, mumps and rubella. The story, published on the alternate Newsnetwork, is in fact the same account that was published in 2013 on a blog called WhiteoutPress. The story was broken by Forbes when it first appeared. The \"courts confirm\" case centre comes from the 2012 conclusion of an Italian court that linked a child's diagnosis with autism to the MMR vaccine that the child received a year ago. The Court relied heavily on the 1998 Wickfield MMR Lancet paper, which was now retracted and discredited, and which was considered scientifically and morally flawed by deliberate fraudulent behaviour. The Wakefield medical license was subsequently revoked. In several subsequent studies since then, scientists have not been able to show any correlation between MMR vaccine and autism. The court also heard the testimony of a doctor, Massimo Montinari, hired by the child &apos; s parents and known to encourage parents to avoid vaccination of their children. Montinari also wrote a book on how vaccines cause autism and autism that he allegedly made, as Forbes mentioned. In 2017, he was reportedly suspended for six months because there was no scientific evidence that his method, for which patients were said to have paid thousands of euros, was effective. The Gateway Pundit, 20 January 2021, says: \"The World Health Organization (WHO) acknowledges that its test was greatly exaggerated for individuals who have been tested positively for COVID.\" However, this Court is in fact a long-standing mechanism called the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Programme, which was established on 1 October 1988 to evaluate vaccine injury claims. This was confirmed by the 1986 National Child Vaccines Act, following a series of lawsuits that threatened to reduce vaccine shortages and vaccination rates in the United States, which could lead to the re-emergence of vaccine-preventable diseases. \"Most people who get vaccines have no serious problems, but like any medicine, they can cause side effects - most of them rare and cute,\" says the programme's website. \"In very rare cases, a vaccine can cause a serious problem, such as a severe allergic reaction. In such cases, the National Programme for the Compensation of Vaccine Injuries provides individuals with an opportunity to file a petition or claim for financial compensation.\" With specific regard to autism, after thousands of parents had filed claims under the Expanded Programme on Immunization that the so-called vaccines had caused autism to their children, the United States Federal Claims Tribunal had established a comprehensive consolidation process - similar to a collective lawsuit - to resolve it. Three special masters were appointed to evaluate three test cases from the group. Finally, the Court rejected compensation and ruled that the evidence presented in the cases did not establish a link between autism and some early childhood vaccines, including maternal mortality. In a statement shortly after the adoption of the resolutions, the United States Department of Health and Human Services issued a statement stating: \"It is hoped that the design by private gentlemen will help reassure parents that vaccines do not cause autism.\" Our verdict in a year-old story claims that the courts have \"slowly confirmed\" that MMR vaccine causes autism. The story relies heavily on an Italian court case in 2012, based on a retrograde and notorious study in 1998. It also wrongly indicates that American \"courts\" quietly pay families for vaccine-related autism. Indeed, the well-known national vaccine injury compensation programme has evaluated vaccine injury claims since 1988. Court proceedings and several scientific studies have established a link between autism and vaccines. This story distorts the importance of court judgements and provides vague examples and few evidence. It's pants on fire!
