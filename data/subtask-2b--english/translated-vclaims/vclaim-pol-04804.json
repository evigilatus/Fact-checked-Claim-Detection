In a policy speech on June 22, 2016, in New York, Trump tried to compare himself with his potential fall opponent, the Democratic Hillary Clinton. In short, the experience of Hillary Clinton as President has resulted in a deadly external political catastrophe after all, as Tramp said. \"Everything began with its bad judgment in support of the war in Iraq in the first place. \"Though I was not in government service, I was one of the first to criticize the rush to war, and yes, even before the war began,\" said Trump. Trump, it's true that Clinton supported the war in Iraq. But Trump was wrong to suggest that he opposed the war before it started. We studied press articles and television lectures from 2002 and 2003 in the midst of the debate that led to the war in Iraq. We found no examples of Trump categorically denouncing war until one year after the war began. The Tramp's most condemnable comments on Tramp's claim were an interview in September 2002, in which Trump stated that he supported Iraq's invasion. He asked Trump if he supported the invasion on the horizon. Trump answered: \"Yeah, I think so.\" This is in direct contravention of Tramp &apos; s claims that he criticized the rush to war before the war began. In January 28, 2003, just three months before the invasion, Neil Cafoto of Fox News Trump asked whether President George W. Bush should focus more on Iraq or the economy. Speaking of Iraq, Trump said: \"Well, either he does something or he does nothing, perhaps, because maybe we shouldn't do it yet and maybe we should wait for the United Nations, you know. He's under a lot of pressure. I think he's doing a pretty good job. But, of course, if you look at polls, a lot of people get a little tired. I believe that the Iraqi situation is a problem. I think the economy is a much bigger problem as far as the President is concerned.\" The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 On January 11, 2012, Trump commented here that he was skeptical of the mission in Iraq, saying that the economy should be a top priority. But does this prove that Trump was \"one of the first to criticize the rush of war\"? Barely. A week after the United States invasion of Iraq on 19 March 2003, Trump gave varying degrees. At the Academy Awards after the party, Trump said that \"war is a mess,\" according to the Washington Post. Tell Fox News that because of the war, \"the market will rise like a rocket.\" In August 2004 in Esquire, the most cruel criticism in Trump came out of the war: \"Look at the war in Iraq and the chaos we are in. I wouldn't have handled it that way. Does anyone really think that Iraq would be a great democracy where people would run into the voting box and gently put in their vote and the winner would happily advance to lead the country? Come on. Two minutes after we leave, there will be a revolution, the smartest, most violent man who will take over. He will have weapons of mass destruction, which Saddam did not have. \"What's the purpose of all this thing? Hundreds and hundreds of young people were killed. And what about the people who come back without arms and legs? Not to mention the other side. All these Iraqi children that were blown to pieces. It turned out that all the causes of the war were blatantly wrong. It's all for nothing!\" \"I don't think we made the right decision to go to Iraq, but, you know, we hope we're going out.\" It is clear that Trump opposed Iraq's war in its early years. But there is no evidence that he defended the war in the first place, or that he was one of the first to criticize the rush to war. Our verdict on Iraq's war, Trump said, \"I was among the first to criticize the rush to war, and yes, even before the war began.\" The Register does not support this. We found only one example of Trump's comment on Iraq's war prior to the invasion, where he seemed scared but did not strongly oppose the process. In another interview, Trump said he supported the invasion. This claim is a false price.
