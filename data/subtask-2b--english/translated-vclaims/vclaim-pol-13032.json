During the 2010 election season in Georgia, many Democrats and Republicans separately declared that Peech State was \"Saudi Arabia pine trees.\" We viewed that claim in July 2010 and assessed it as barely correct. One of the latest comparisons of that oil-rich nation in the Middle East came from the majority leader of the House Eric Cantor, one of the most powerful politicians in Washington. :: Kantor, Congressman of the Republic of Virginia, stopped at the Atlanta Press Club last week during a two-day visit to Georgia. :: During the question-and-answer part of the programme, Kantor took several verbal blows in President Barack Obama, a democracy. One criticism was that Obama did not do enough to boost more energy sources, specifically coal, where car drivers smoke on high gas prices. \"We are Saudi Arabia of coal,\" said Cantor. More than 90 per cent of coal production in the United States goes to generate electricity in the United States, according to the National Mining Association. Cantor explained his view of coal. He said, \"We must be able to find a way to use this resource so that we can keep competing.\" We wondered how Cantor was trying to make a comparison with Saudi Arabia. John Murray, Deputy Chief of Staff of Cantor, said Congressman was trying to be \"unexplainable.\" Murray added more in the e-mail. Murray said: \"Energy is an abundant domestic resource that remains critical to meeting our country's energy needs.\" \"As we expect the Administration to present a realistic national energy strategy, we need to harness our current assets - such as coal - to generate the energy needed by businesses and American families.\" Let us reflect closely on this comparison between the United States and Saudi Arabia. Even Obama repeated this phrase, during a television interview with the Canadian Radio Company in Saudi Arabia in 2009, which, according to the United States Government, exports more oil than any country in the world, 8.7 million barrels per day. Saudi Arabia also has a larger oil reserve than any other country, as the United States says. By the way, the United States ranks thirteenth and fourteenth, respectively, in these two categories. The figures show that Saudi Arabia is the owner of oil exports and reserves. Now, is the United States the king of coal? The United States leads the world with coal in its reserves, according to data maintained by the United States Energy Information Department. Russia was the second, but about 50 percent beyond the United States, shows environmental impact assessment data. But is the former enemy of the cold war playing shame with his numbers? Some experts believe that Russia and China do not issue full estimates of their coal reserves. The United States produces and exports less coal than some other countries. The United States produced approximately 1.1 billion tons of coal in 2009, after China, according to the latest available data from the environmental impact assessment. A small ton of coal is worth 2,000 pounds. Annual coal production in America has been almost the same since 2000. China, with a boom in its economy over the past decade, has increased its coal production from 1.3 billion tons in 2000 to nearly 3.4 billion tons in 2009, showing environmental impact assessment data. For eight of the last 10 years, the United States exported an average of 50 million tons of coal each year. The United States exports of coal are currently lower than those of Australia, Colombia, Indonesia, Russia and South Africa. The United States has the most comprehensive and powerful coal mining systems in the world, as the National Mining Association says. Hal Quinn, President of the Assembly, told a congressional committee on Tuesday that the federal government had put \"big obstacles\" to industry's efforts to reach the land where many of the country's coal reserves were kept. The Association represents some 325 companies in the mining industry. Others question the extent to which those reserves are subject to adjustment. The professor at the University of West Virginia School of Law, Patrick McGinley, said that a lot of coal in America was located in hard-to-extract locations. He referred to recent research that had concluded that the production of coal in the world (highest quality coal reasonably verifiable) would peak this year. \"It is unrealistic to equate United States coal reserves with Saudi Arabia's oil reserves,\" said McGinley, who served on the committee that investigated the explosion of the West Virginia coal mine, which killed 29 people in April 2010. The Cantor argument supports data showing that the United States currently has the largest coal reserve in the world. America lags far behind China in terms of coal production, and the United States lags behind several other countries in exporting coal. The congressman's statement leaves some details on America's position on coal. Since the United States is still Saudi Arabia, which retains coal reserves, we value Cantor's claim that it is mostly true.
