People must have been writing tons of letters complaining about how racist the name was in order to get President Obama to weigh in on the issue.\nThe number of complaints the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office received about the Redskins name was astounding, but not because there were so many. In fact, it\u2019s quite the opposite. The agency received zero complaints about the team\u2019s name. Zero.\nThe post by the Conservative Tribune deems this evidence of a left-wing scheme to win voters and open \"the door for repealing the First Amendment.\"\nWe checked it out and did not exactly find a scandal.\nMost notably, the post fails to mention why the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office considered canceling the trademarks in the first place: People complained about it.\nThe Conservative Tribune blog post links to a story at Weasel Zippers, which links back to a story that first appeared in the conservative Washington Times newspaper.\nOn June 18, 2014, a panel of three administrative law judges known as the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board canceled the team\u2019s trademark registrations on the grounds that it disparages American Indians. As expected, the team is appealing the decision, just as it did when it challenged the same panel\u2019s decision in 1999 in a related complaint and won. (The football team can keep the rights to its trademark as it goes through the appeals process.)\nTwo weeks after the decision, the Washington Times ran a story about how the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office could not produce any records that showed members of the public wrote in to express their opinions about the team\u2019s name before the most recent ruling.\nThe newspaper\u2019s public records request for correspondence about the logo turned up 13 pages of records, half of which came from a Texas man who wrote a \"meandering\" letter by hand after the ruling. The other pages came from a person congratulating the appeals board and from staffers seeking background information about the case for Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, the nonvoting member of Congress from Washington, D.C. (and an opponent of the team\u2019s name).\nIs it the \"bombshell\" as described by the Conservative Tribune website? Not really.\nThe U.S. Patent and Trademark Office does not solicit public comment like other government agencies as they consider new rules and regulations. It\u2019s not built that way.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIts process prescribed by the U.S. Code works similar to a legal trial, in which only the parties involved can submit evidence. There could be one letter or 1,000, but it\u2019s not going to make a difference in whether a trademark is granted or canceled. Put another way, it\u2019s not part of the process in the way that the Environmental Protection Agency or Federal Trade Commission reviews public input before considering a new rule or regulation.\nIn this case, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office acts more like the Supreme Court, in that the court wouldn\u2019t solicit or consider your opinion of the health care law before it issued a ruling.\n\"The presence or absence of letters of complaint in a case like this really does not have any bearing on whether or not a trademark is going to be canceled,\" said Elizabeth Rowe,\u00a0University of Florida College of Law professor and director of the Program in Intellectual Property Law. \"If you want a trademark to be canceled, you have to do what the plaintiffs did here.\"\nThe Redskins case deals with existing trademark registrations, which require investment on the part of people who seek to have the trademark canceled under federal code. In this case, five young people with American Indian heritage petitioned the Patent and Trademark Office in 2006 to cancel the registrations, arguing that it is disparaging.\nThere is a brief period to allow for opposition to pending trademark applications, but a simple letter of complaint would not do much there either, Rowe said. That window is usually used by rival companies to assert whether a logo is too close to their own and confusing for consumers, and objections involve filing an objection, evidence to support it and having a hearing.\n\"It\u2019s really neither here nor there to say that they were letters of complaint or how many were there,\" Rowe said.\nThe Washington Times article that called the missing public comment into question even echoes these points, quoting the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney and a Georgetown University professor as saying public correspondence isn\u2019t built into the process for hearing individual cases.\nFor what it's worth, there are petitions\u00a0at websites like\u00a0Change.org\u00a0and MoveOn.org\u00a0in favor of changing the name or ditching it, and some have thousands of signatures. But the\u00a0aim is to rally people about the issue and exert pressure on team ownership, not to influence the decisions of administrative law judges.\nOur ruling\nConservative blog posts smell a scandal in the cancellation of the Washington Redskins trademark, pointing out that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office \"received zero complaints\" about it before an administrative law court ruled in June.\nThe case was opened because someone complained -- so that assertion is wrong on its face.\nBut even that aside, the post is misleading in suggesting that public comments are part of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office process when they are not.\nWhen people have a problem with patents and trademarks and want them removed, they file formal complaints, prove their standing in the case, pay a fee, and provide evidence to support their case.\nIn other words, they do exactly what the five plaintiffs in this case did here.\nWe rate the claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07636"}
