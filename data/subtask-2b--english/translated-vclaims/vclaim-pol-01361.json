Here's George Soros. The name of the Hungarian benefactor, the director of the hedge fund and the main liberal donor symbolizes things for some in the Republican party, i.e. the extreme liberal ideals and the willingness to spend millions of dollars to support them. This quickly leads us to an announcement by the National Commission of the Republican Congress, which wants the Republican Party candidate, Jim Hagdorn, to win an open seat in the First Congressional Region of Minnesota. Thus, the declaration of the Norwegian Refugee Council, one of the two declarations prepared in rapid succession to similar topics, seeks to link the democratic candidate in the race, Dan Vihan, to Soros. We're at Polyte Fact dealing with allegations made through words, so we're not going to judge the image of the ad showing cartoon piles of money piled up in front of the billionaire -- and Colin Kibernik, the former protestant quarterback, right next to Soros, with the masked mob in front of him. But the words, spoken by one of the broadcasters, say: \"Billions of Soros finance resistance and Dan Vihan. Vihan is employed by a liberal costume funded by Soros in the capital and his campaign \"supported by state professionals supported by millions of Soros.\" Does Fihan work in a Soros-funded liberal costume, and does his campaign \"supported\" by the Paxes supported by Soros? This allegation is inaccurate, despite what Steve Steve Stevers, Chairman of the National Reconciliation Commission, said when he defended the NBC Declaration \"Meet the Press\" last Sunday: \"This Declaration is a Real Declaration.\" We will explain why this is not true, but here is a hint: they are not full-time employees of the think tank to which the Declaration links. Even if it were, it would be fair to say that a major defence contractor and the United States Government are currently funding a larger think tank than Soros -- President Donald Trump's Secretary of Defense was on the board of directors and very much liked the work of the centre. The job of Fahn is an Iraqi war veteran, a former teacher and a former assistant to the Acting Minister of Defence of the Obama administration. He's doing research and writing as an assistant colleague to the new American Security Center. The Centre has told us that this means that it contributes to research and is paid on a project-by-project basis, and it is equally recommended that it be compensated: as of August 13, the financial disclosure of its candidate recorded $55,412 in \"research/writing\" income for the Centre this year and $7,916 from last year. In contrast, some of the Centre &apos; s full-time senior colleagues were providing between $172,000 and $197,000 in 2016, forms deposited in the IRS programme. The think tank was described as liberal because it was founded by two experts in democratic foreign policy. But in an article for Fox, it's also described as a little intermediate, representing the old George H.W. Bush's view of foreign policy; some people say it's Hillary Clinton's point of view - it's only where the U.S. government has been for a very long time.\" The L.A. Times in 2013 called the Center \"Respectful\" and \"Hawk Democrats' Sanctuary.\" The new U.S. Security Center has a fan in James Matisse, Secretary of Defense of Trump. Matisse was a member of the Board of Directors of the Centre before returning to service with the Government. The Centre's website quotes that the Centre \"understands the importance of all American citizens with ideas worthy of a national security conversation.\" Other board members include James Murdoch, son of Robert Murdoch and CEO of Fox XXI; former Sen Joe Lieberman, independent of Connecticut; and Richard L. Armitage, Foreign Policy Adviser to Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush. The President of the Centre, Richard Fontaine, was Foreign Policy Adviser to the late S. John McCain, Republic of Arizona. On January 13, 2021, bloggers announced the extraordinary truth-checking story in which General David H. Berger, the commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request to use the Marines to launch security, saying, \"We are not working for you.\" By Samantha Butterman: 17 January 2021, Soros donated his funding to the Centre through his Open Society Foundation. The spokesperson for the Open Society, Jonathan Kaplan, told us that since 2014, institutions have granted the Centre $1.5 million. \"These grants supported research on the prevention of war with North Korea, the use of armed drones, foreign American military assistance and human rights issues,\" he said in an e-mail. There is a more useful context for understanding this. According to its files, the Centre received $12.2 million in gifts, grants and contributions from all sources in 2016 alone, $14.6 million in 2015 and $8.5 million in 2014. The IRS files of 2017 were not available, but the information revealed by IRS shows that in 12 months between 1 October 2016 and 30 September 2017, Open Society institutions provided between $250,000 and $499,000. This places Soros in the same category of donors as Boeing, Johns Hopkins University and Smith Richardson Foundation, which, according to domestic charity, supports new provincial issues and governors such as the American Enterprise Institute and the Hoover Foundation. Who gave more? The Centre &apos; s website places contributions in categories, and the category of the deepest voluntary contributions is $500,000 and above. In the last fiscal year, only three of them were on the list: Northrop Gruman, a giant defense contractor; the United States Government; and Michael J. Zach, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Centre and major investor at Charles River Ventures. Soros did not contribute directly to the Vihan campaign. But when we requested the support of the National Reconciliation Commission to support its claim, American priorities were included, Soros has given the priorities of the United States of America $5 million for 2018, confirming our examination of the records of the Federal Election Commission, making it the second largest donor to the Pan African Union Congress (back of Donald Sussman, from the Paloma Precautionary Fund). The priorities in the United States of America, in turn, spent at least $103,452 running digital ads to oppose Hagedorn, the Republican who vahan v. The National Reconciliation Commission has also included a super-political party affiliated with the leaders of the Democratic House of Representatives, the majority party in the House of Representatives, which, as of last week, spent $972,949 to oppose Hagedorn, to publish advertisements on television and websites, to send direct mail to Minnesota houses, and to display records. Soros did not donate to the majority party in the House of Representatives at this election session. But the National Reconciliation Commission told us that Soros provided approximately $2.2 million in 2016, and records confirm that. Our ruling is that \"Bleuner George Soros is financing\" Dan Vihan, who \"works from a Swiss-funded liberal outfit in the capital.\" His campaign is \"supported by super-state supporters supported by millions of Soros.\" Sorus is currently a major donor to PAC Super, the priorities of the United States of America, which supports Feehan through its declarations of criticism of Hagedorn. Moreover, this allegation is collapsing. He is an assistant staff member in Otvite who has other very generous financiers, including the main defence contractors. The Centre has been described as liberal in media accounts, but it has also been described in other ways, and its former and current members include persons selected by Republican Presidents, including Trump, for high-level positions. Soros didn't donate to Fihan, and he didn't donate Bunkerall to Fihan. We're assessing the allegation wrong.
