Rand Paul, R-Ky., says Hillary Clinton is to blame for inadequate security in Benghazi, Libya, where four Americans died on Sept. 11, 2012.\n\nShe was asked repeatedly as secretary of state to provide security, Paul told CNN State of the Union host Candy Crowley on May 19, 2013, including in \"direct cables.\"\n\nCrowley asked Paul about his recent comments in Iowa and New Hampshire that Clinton\u2019s failure should disqualify her from the presidency.\n\n\"It's that you did it in Iowa or New Hampshire which gives it a political patina, and I'm asking you if you think that's helpful,\" she said.\n\nPaul replied, \"You know, I've done it in every state and every stop because I think it's pretty important that she accept blame for not providing security. She was asked repeatedly to provide security in Benghazi on several occasions including direct cables, and she says she never read the cables on security. I find that inexcusable and a dereliction of duty.\n\n\"Whether it has political overtones or not, it really goes to the heart of who you are as secretary of state if you do not provide security for an embassy that's begging for it, that's absolutely a dereliction of duty and she should have resigned and accepted blame for it.\"\n\nDid Clinton herself get repeated requests for security before armed terrorists attacked, including in \"direct cables\"?\n\nCables 101\n\nPaul\u2019s office said Clinton\u2019s name on diplomatic cables demonstrates she was involved in security decisions \u2014 or that she should have been.\n\n\"It may be even more damning an indictment of Clinton if she is correct, because her disinterest in her job may have cost the lives of U.S. citizens overseas,\" said Moira Bagley, a Paul spokeswoman. \u00a0\n\nShe pointed to a claim from House Republicans, reported by the Los Angeles Times in April, that a cable signed by Clinton proposed security reductions in Benghazi before the attack.\n\n\"Clinton's signature is on this cable and others,\" Bagley said. \"If Secretary Clinton signed a cable to reduce security, then her signature is strong evidence that she read cables.\"\n\n(Bagley didn\u2019t offer evidence that Clinton \"was asked repeatedly to provide security\" including \"direct cables.\" But we\u2019ll get there in a minute.)\n\nFirst, is Clinton\u2019s \"signature\" strong evidence of her personal involvement?\n\nLet\u2019s talk for a second about diplomatic cables.\n\nThink of them as messages sent via a new-fangled email system \u2014 dubbed \"CableExpress\" \u2014 that draws on some old-school customs. How old-school? The messages are also called \"telegrams.\"\n\nThe State Department\u2019s Foreign Affairs Manual has all kinds of rules and instructions for drafting, formatting, addressing and sending these things.\n\nWe browsed through several sections of the manual\u2019s \"Correspondence Handbook,\" learning interesting tidbits such as, \"If you are sending a telegram from a Post to the Department or to another Post, enter respectively \"SECSTATE WASHDC\"; or the telegraphic form of the other post (e.g. AMEMBASSY BERLIN, AMCONSUL CHIANG MAI) in the addressee field.\"\n\nHere\u2019s what we learned.\n\nIf you\u2019re sending a telegram \"to a post from the department\" \u2014 so, say, to a particular embassy from Washington, D.C. \u2014 you address it to the post, and it carries the name of the secretary of state.\n\nThat\u2019s right: The State Department\u2019s communications center puts the secretary\u2019s name \"on all telegrams to posts.\" When Clinton was in charge, that meant the \"signature\" on telegrams was hers.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean she signed them \u2014 just that her name was printed at the bottom.\n\nThat\u2019s why, when Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., argued on TV in April that Clinton had personally signed a cable about reducing U.S. security staff in Benghazi, Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler, who covered the State Department for nine years, called it a \"whopper.\"\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., confirmed that assessment in May, saying, \"We have now seen this cable and she did not sign it. Her name is printed at the bottom just like tens of thousands of cables sent every year from the department.\"\n\nBut as we mentioned previously, Paul\u2019s claim was about messages sent the other way, from a U.S. embassy to Washington.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow are those addressed? To \"SECSTATE\" in \"WASHDC.\"\n\nWhile a cable addressed to \"SECSTATE\" may look like a \"direct cable\" to the secretary of state, the reality is somewhat less exciting. \"SECSTATE,\" according to another part of the Foreign Affairs Manual, is the \"location indicator\" for the entire State Department, including the Peace Corps.\n\nAbout 1.4 million cables a year are addressed that way.\n\nHere\u2019s how Clinton explained it to the House Foreign Affairs Committee in January: \"They are all addressed to me. They do not all come to me. They are reported through the bureaucracy.\"\n\nShe said security requests from Libya never came to her attention.\n\n\"I was not aware of that going on,\" she said. \"It was not brought to my attention, but obviously it\u2019s something we\u2019re fixing and intend to put into place protocols and systems to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again.\"\n\nSecurity requests\n\nSo, Clinton\u2019s name or title on millions of diplomatic cables doesn\u2019t say much of anything about whether she personally knew of their contents. In the case of Benghazi security, she testified under oath that she didn\u2019t.\n\nBut it\u2019s clear repeated requests were made to Washington.\n\nA report from the State Department\u2019s Accountability Review Board in December 2012 noted that the number of diplomatic security staff in Benghazi the day of the attack was inadequate despite \"repeated requests \u2026 for additional staffing.\"\n\nThe board focused attention below the secretary of state, finding that \"certain senior State Department officials within two bureaus demonstrated a lack of proactive leadership and management ability in their responses to security concerns posed by Special Mission Benghazi, given the deteriorating threat environment and the lack of reliable host government protection.\"\n\nBut it didn\u2019t find reasonable cause to determine that anyone breached his or her duty.\n\nHouse Republicans, critical of the review board\u2019s focus on lower-level officials, released their own interim report in April. It says that in the months before the attack, officials from the U.S. mission in Libya stressed inadequate security and a need for more staff in \"numerous communications.\"\n\nThe Republicans' report mentions two cables and two email messages in particular, from March, April, June and July 2012, that reflect a back-and-forth in which diplomats requested more U.S. security personnel, but Washington officials said no. They preferred trained Libyan security staff.\n\nNone of the messages involve Clinton \u2014 except that one of them bears her \"signature,\" as any cable out of Washington would.\n\nStill, some recent testimony before the House Oversight Committee suggested there\u2019s some expectation she should have been familiar with the discussion.\n\nEric Nordstrom, the State Department\u2019s former regional security officer in Libya, drafted some of the cables from the embassy requesting additional security, including the one from March cited by Republicans.\n\nHe testified before lawmakers on May 8, 2013, that he would have expected Clinton to have read or been briefed on that cable.\n\n\"I certainly expected (that) given the fact that she had an involvement in the security process,\" he said.\n\nShe would have had to personally approve Defense Department security teams that had been deployed, Nordstrom testified \u2014 teams that he requested in the March cable to keep.\n\n\"She also came out to post, toured our facilities and toured the facilities and saw the lack of security there \u2014 that was something that her country team \u2014 or she was briefed by the country team as she visited the site,\" he said.\n\nStill, when lawmakers asked him if the State Department\u2019s review board let anyone off the hook, he pointed to the undersecretary for management, Patrick Kennedy, rather than Clinton.\n\n\"I think she has a very reasonable assertion some of these issues weren't brought to her attention,\" Nordstrom said. \"Well, how do we fix that so they are brought to the attention of the secretary of state? It is not lost on me that as the unheeded messenger this time around, I look at where those messages seem to stop, the undersecretary for management. ...\"\n\n\"There is something apparently wrong with the process of how those security recommendations are raised to the secretary,\" he said.\n\nOur ruling\n\nPaul blamed Clinton for Benghazi security failures, saying she \"was asked repeatedly to provide security in Benghazi on several occasions, including direct cables.\"\n\nThe State Department was asked repeatedly for additional U.S. security staff in Libya. But we see no evidence that Clinton herself was made aware of those requests. For example, there\u2019s no \"direct cable\" that automatically appears on the secretary of state\u2019s desk. Instead, all cables would have carried her name, and only those passed up the chain by staff would have reached her. She says these ones didn\u2019t.\n\nMeanwhile, the same security officer who testified that he would have expected her to be briefed on his request for more staff also said, \"there is something apparently wrong with the process of how those security recommendations are raised to the secretary.\"\n\nPaul\u2019s office didn\u2019t provide evidence linking requests for security directly to Clinton. We found only evidence that requests were made of her department. We rate his statement Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09306"}
