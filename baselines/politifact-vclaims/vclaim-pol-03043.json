Republican Paul Mango \u2014 a Harvard-educated veteran and former healthcare consultant \u2014 will attempt to use it to take the governor\u2019s mansion in Harrisburg.\nMango kicked off his campaign in May, running in part on an anti-tax platform. At an event at Lackawanna College in mid-May, Mango called Democrat Gov. Tom Wolf \"Thomas the Tax Engine,\" according to The Scranton Times-Tribune. \"He has never met a tax he doesn\u2019t like,\" Mango continued to reporters. \"He has requested almost $6 billion in taxes in the years he\u2019s been in office. We cannot afford any more of Tom Wolf.\"\nMango has repeatedly used that nickname for Wolf, including in a campaign video posted to YouTube on May 18. What\u2019s changed, however, is Mango\u2019s estimate for Wolf\u2019s proposed tax increases: from $6 billion to more than $8 billion during the governor\u2019s time in office.\n\"Governor Wolf is refusing to accept a revenue plan unless it includes tax increases,\" a July 24 post on Mango\u2019s campaign Facebook page states. \"As Governor, Wolf has already proposed more than $8B in tax increases.\"\nHas Wolf earned the Tax Engine sobriquet?\nWhen contacted about the $6 billion claim in May, a Mango campaign advisor, Matthew E. Beynon of consulting firm BrabenderCox, shared a spreadsheet that showed $5.7 billion in estimated revenue from tax increases and modifications for budget years 2015-16, 2016-17 and 2017-18. The sources listed were Wolf\u2019s executive budgets.\nWhile the revenue estimates for years 2016-17 and 2017-18 matched those under the heading \"PROPOSED TAX AND REVENUE MODIFICATIONS\" in Wolf\u2019s proposed budgets, the estimate for 2015-16 did not. Mango\u2019s campaign estimated 2015-16 revenue at $1.9 billion, while Wolf\u2019s own budget showed the revenue estimate at $4.6 billion. The bulk of that \u2014 an estimated $2.4 billion \u2014 would have come from an increase in the personal income tax rate and an additional $1.6 billion from a higher and expanded sales and use tax.\nWhen asked about the discrepancy, Beynon said, \"We based our initial numbers by taking the most conservative estimates that we found.\" The campaign revised the numbers, he said, to project $8.6 billion in \"tax increases\" during Wolf\u2019s time in office.\nThat $8.6 billion figure appears to come from combining the positive revenue estimates from tax changes proposed in Wolf\u2019s first three budgets. It falls to an estimated $8.3 billion when tax cuts and modifications that would have resulted in a revenue reduction in budget years 2015-16 and 2016-17 are included.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPat Toomey\n\n\nstated on January 19, 2021 in a hearing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere will be several thousand dollars in payments going to families with six-figure incomes who\u2019ve had no income interruption whatsoever.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jessica Calefati \u2022 January 21, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGina Diorio, director of media relations for the Commonwealth Foundation, said the conservative think-tank would use that $8.3 billion number as the estimate for Wolf\u2019s tax increase requests during his time in office.\nHowever, Marc Stier, director of the nonpartisan Pennsylvania Budget and Policy Center, says it is misleading to look at the proposals cumulatively.\nProposed tax changes from Wolf's first budget did not pass and were modified and carried over to the second. The same goes for Wolf's second and third budget proposals, although to a lesser degree.\nIn budget year 2016-17, Wolf proposed $2.7 billion in tax changes. Stier said that\u2019s practically what Wolf asked for during his first budget year when one takes into account the $2.1 billion in property tax relief it would have provided. \"That is a tax shift,\" he said.\nHypothetically, if Wolf\u2019s requests for tax increases would have been granted during the first year, there would be no deficit today and therefore no need to increase taxes.\n\"If the General Assembly had enacted [Wolf\u2019s] tax proposals from the first or the second year, there would be no need to enact any taxes this year,\" Stier said in a follow-up email. \"We have a two-year deficit (this year and next year) that approaches $4 billion. If we raised $2.7 billion (or a bit more with inflation) this year and next, we would have $5.4 billion more revenue over two years. Thus there would be no need for new tax revenues.\"\nThe Commonwealth Foundation\u2019s Diorio said she couldn\u2019t \"conjecture what might or might not have been introduced had certain tax proposals passed.\"\nWhen asked about Mango's tax claim,\u00a0Beth Melena, communications director for the Pennsylvania Democratic Party, said Wolf was working to restore $1 billion in education cuts and was dealing with \"a massive budget deficit\" when he proposed his first budget. The statement did not directly address the number.\nOur ruling\nMango asserted at a campaign kickoff event that Wolf has requested \"nearly $6 billion in taxes\" since taking office. His campaign revised that estimate to more than $8 billion, which is approximately the total revenue estimate from tax changes in Wolf\u2019s three budgets combined. But one expert says looking at the proposals cumulatively is misleading, as proposed changes that did not pass were modified and carried over from one year to the next.
