According to the Obama campaign, his number comes from a 2004 study by the Bio Center for Global Climate Change, which calculated that Japanese cars would receive 46 MB if Japan followed the same test methods as the United States (Obama accurately states that the United States was 27.5 years old). Obama's claim is technically correct. However, Pio figures are exaggerated in the differences between countries because, according to Lee Schipper, Director of Research at the Center for Transport and Environment of the World Resources Institute, these estimates do not reflect the circumstances of the real world. On January 13, 2021, the distinguished fact-checkers announced in a story in which General David H. Berger, the commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request to use the Marines to launch security, saying, \"We're not working for you.\" Samantha Butterman, on January 17, 2021, says: \"The Japanese fleet is actually on average about 23 megabytes on the road today, but it is improving. The U.S. number is slightly lower, about 21, but it was stagnating. The real world figures are closer because, despite Japan's most fuel-efficient cars, heavy traffic is obliterating a lot of efficiency. Shepper said Obama said, \"It's true that Japan's fuel efficiency is higher and better faster, but his number is inaccurate. The number he used didn't really represent a realistic achievement on the road. However, Shepherd said he didn't blame Obama for the confusion. \"Everybody makes this mistake. What matters is what cars really get on the road, how long it takes to change the whole fleet and how many people drive.\" == sync, corrected by elderman == (Japanese drivers drive about a third of miles a year like the United States) (drivers)", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00343"}
