Marco Rubio is trying to stamp out criticism from other presidential candidates about his slick, zip-up boots by saying he\u2019s giving American business a leg up.\nRubio\u2019s ankle boots became the subject of Internet scrutiny after he was photographed wearing them in New Hampshire on Jan. 3, 2016.\nPundits and fashion columnists commented on them ad nauseam. Rubio drew fire from his GOP rivals for being perhaps a bit too chic for the campaign trail. Some speculated they were to make the 5-foot-10 senator appear taller. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul called the boots \"cute\" and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush\u2019s Right to Rise super PAC made a commercial mocking them.\nWhile Rubio initially called the focus on his footwear \"craziness,\" he\u2019s worked at thinking on his feet. At a Jan. 18 campaign event in Waverly, Iowa, a voter jokingly asked about the boots. Rubio declared his boots, appropriately outfitted with a Cuban heel, are a patriotic choice.\n\"They sold out of those boots online,\" Rubio said. \"They\u2019re made in Wisconsin. Florsheim! You know what that means? That means I did more for American business in one week than Barack Obama did in seven years!\"\nHe\u2019s right that Florsheim\u2019s website says some sizes of their $135 Duke boots are out of stock, but they should be available by Feb. 1. A Florsheim spokesman told us sales of that style have \"increased significantly\" since Rubio was shown wearing them.\nAs for the part about being made in Wisconsin, well, Rubio probably should have watched his step.\nLike all of the Glendale, Wis., company\u2019s shoes, Rubio\u2019s boots aren\u2019t made in the United States. The company did recently collaborate with designer George Esquivel to create a luxury shoe line that is made in California, but Florsheim said their products are made in Asia, mostly from China.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 23, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBiden invested the entire family fortune in Ukraine gas and oil. Then shuts down Keystone pipeline. Starting to get the picture.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat trend goes back to the 1970s, when Florsheim\u2019s then-owner, St. Louis-based International Shoe Co., moved production to India, where Rubio\u2019s Duke boots were manufactured. The company also makes some items in Italy.\nFounded in 1892 in Chicago, Florsheim once had five U.S. factories and 2,500 employees by the 1920s. While at one time holding 70 percent of the men\u2019s shoe market, the company eventually suffered from lackluster sales and a stodgy image, declaring bankruptcy in 2002.\nIt was resurrected by Florsheim family scions through Weyco Group, the same company that distributes shoe brands like Nunn Bush and Stacy Adams (also foreign-made). No shoes are made at Weyco\u2019s headquarters in suburban Milwaukee.\nIt\u2019s not really surprising that the American company\u2019s boots are imports, as shoe manufacturing in the United States is on shaky footing these days. The American Apparel and Footwear Association said that domestic production has started to increase in recent years, but U.S. boot and shoe sales are still around 98 percent imports.\nRubio\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t respond when we pointed out the boots were not made in America. There are still bootmakers in Wisconsin, however. Weinbrenner Shoe Company, for example, makes work boots in two central Wisconsin factories, and Allen Edmonds makes most of its high-end shoes and boots in Port Washington, about 20 miles north of Glendale.\nOur ruling\nRubio said his much-discussed boots are \"made in Wisconsin.\"\nHis Florsheim ankle boots aren\u2019t made in the Badger State, where the company is headquartered. Florsheim told us most of their products are made in China, but Rubio\u2019s boots came from India.\nWe have to put our foot down on this one.
