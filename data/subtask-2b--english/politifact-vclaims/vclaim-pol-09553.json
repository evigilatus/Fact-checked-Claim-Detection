A: They are all Draft Dodgers,\" according to the meme received March 17 by PolitiFact New Jersey.\nDraft dodging is a serious accusation, but in Liberals Are Cool\u2019s case, theirs lacks any shred of accuracy.\nLet\u2019s explain how the draft worked during the Vietnam era, which the Selective Service System defines as August 1964 through December 1972.\nMen who received a draft notice in the mail had about three weeks to return paperwork requesting a hearing for a deferment, Selective Service System spokesman Pat Schuback said. A local draft board then decided whether to grant the waiver.\n\"For the Vietnam war and World War II, any time there was a draft, there were classifications of deferments,\" Schuback said. \"If you were eligible for it, you were entitled to claim that deferment.\"\nThat\u2019s what happened to the men targeted by Liberals are Cool, according to military classification histories that the Selective Service System shared with us, as well as other public records and published reports.\nThe six each applied for and received education deferments because they were students when their names came up for military service.\u00a0\nRomney also received a religious deferment during the time he was doing Mormon missionary work.\nRomney and Trump also had very high draft numbers, meaning that although they were eligible for military service, their numbers were never called. The first draft lottery for Vietnam occurred on Dec. 1, 1969.\nCheney received an additional deferment when he became a father. A federal law at the time exempted a parent from military service for reasons of \"extreme hardship on dependents.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchuback didn\u2019t have Nugent\u2019s and O\u2019Reilly\u2019s classification histories available but numerous published reports \u2013 including ones from Snopes.com and TheSmokingGun.com indicate that both received education deferments. Both websites use public documents for fact-checking.\nLimbaugh and Nugent were ultimately disqualified from service for medical reasons, according to Snopes.com and TheSmokingGun.com.\nEducation deferments were not unusual, Schuback noted. In fact, millions of Americans received them.\nDuring the Vietnam era there were 26,800,000 men in the United States. Of those, 2,215,000 were drafted. The number of deferments during that time was 1,541,000 \u2013 more than 50 percent of the population eligible for military service, according to the book \"I Want You! The Evolution of the All-Volunteer Force,\" by Bernard D. Rostker that was put out by the RAND Corporation.\nSo what is a \u2018draft dodger\u2019? It\u2019s not someone who received a legitimate and legal deferment from military service, Schuback said.\n\"A draft dodger is someone who got drafted and has then fled, or it also might be a person who made a statement by not registering (for the draft),\" he explained.\n\"I\u2019m not a draft dodger,\" Schuback added, citing himself as an example. \"I got a deferment because I was pursuing a college degree. Calling that a draft dodger is not correct. They can use it a different way but it\u2019s not correct.\"\nLiberals Are Cool did not respond to our request for comment.\nOur ruling\nA Liberals Are Cool meme claims \"Q: What do these \u2018Patriotic Americans\u2019 have in common? A: They are all Draft Dodgers,\" referring to Romney, Trump, Cheney, Limbaugh, Nugent and O\u2019Reilly.\nLiberals Are Cool doesn\u2019t acknowledge that the six registered properly for the draft, then applied for and received legal deferments so they could complete their education \u2013 an opportunity given more than half the men eligible for the U.S. draft during the Vietnam era.\nLiberals Are Cool may not like that these men didn\u2019t face combat, but calling them \u2018draft dodgers\u2019 is wrong \u2013 and ridiculous. As a result, we\u2019re cranking up the heat for this ruling: Pants on Fire!\nTo comment on this story, go to NJ.com.\nTo see a list of military classification codes from the U.S. Selective Service System, and the military classification histories for Romney, Trump, Cheney and Limbaugh, click here.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09553"}
