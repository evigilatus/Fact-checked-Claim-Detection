And it\u2019s not as though premiums didn\u2019t rise. They did, but most people purchasing health care through the marketplace didn\u2019t feel it.\nAccording to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, about 12.2 million people signed up through a federal or state-based marketplace, also called an exchange. Of those, 7.8 million, about 64 percent, qualified for tax credits to reduce how much they personally would pay for coverage. Thanks to the tax credits, the average monthly bill for insurance stayed at $106 from 2016 to 2017, as the government chart below shows.\nThe light blue represents the monthly premium paid by customers out-of-pocket. The darker blue represents the tax credit.\n\n\"Premiums went up, but a lot of people were protected from that,\" said Katherine Hempstead, director of health insurance coverage at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a philanthropy and research group based in New Jersey.\nThe Congressional Budget Office underscored that dynamic in its most recent report on health care legislation. The analysts wrote that many people \"are largely insulated from increases in premiums because their out-of-pocket payments for premiums are based on a percentage of their income; the government pays the difference.\"\nOn average, premiums rose about 32 percent.\nThe government data on the actual premiums people pay isn\u2019t 100 percent complete. Details on about 3 million people who signed up through state-based exchanges are missing. But Hempstead said in the past, people in both groups had similar experiences.\n\"The only place you can get the subsidy is through the exchanges, so for both the federal and the state exchanges, most of the enrollment is from people who qualify for the subsidies,\" Hempstead said.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that as premiums rise, so does the price tag for Washington.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe death spiral debate\nObama was rebutting fears about a death spiral. That concern lies outside this fact-check, but we\u2019ll summarize the arguments on both sides here.\nA death spiral takes place when costs rise so fast, healthy people begin opting to pay a tax penalty rather than pay for health care. With sicker people making up a larger percentage of those left in the health insurance pool, the average cost of care rises dramatically.\nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer took on Obama\u2019s statement during his daily press briefing.\n\"Enrollment is nowhere near expectations and this year is actually declining,\" Spicer said. \"Insurers are fleeing the exchanges, and one in three counties only has one insurer.\"\nA 2016 summary from Mark Farrah Associates, a private analytic service, reported that insurers who left the exchanges cited \"significant losses on Marketplace business\" due in part to lower numbers of healthy enrollees.\nAs for enrollment overall, according to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, sign-ups fell by about 4 percent from 2016 to 2017.\nOutside analysts such as Hempstead say that\u2019s not enough to spell trouble.\n\"Enrollments are largely holding steady,\" she said. \"There is no death spiral.\"\nThe Congressional Budget Office largely agreed. Comparing the Affordable Care Act with the Republican health care bill, the CBO wrote that \"the nongroup market would probably be stable in most areas under either current law or the legislation.\"\nOur ruling\nObama said that on average, the \"vast majority\" of people who have insurance through Obamacare experienced no premium increase. The actual numbers are that about 64 percent of enrollees saw their out-of-pocket premiums stay the same. So in terms of their personal experience, the former president is correct.\nHowever, premiums did rise. The reason many people didn\u2019t feel it is because the government subsidies increased to insulate them.\nObama was largely correct, but he brushed over the reality of rising premiums.\nWe rate this claim Mostly True.
