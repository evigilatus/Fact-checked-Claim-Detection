Frank Pallone in 2010", "text": "Even though her 2010 bid to unseat U.S. Rep. Frank Pallone ended in defeat, Republican congressional candidate Anna Little says she still made history.\n\nAs Little prepares for a rematch against Pallone in the Nov. 6 general election, the Monmouth County native has said the 2010 victory was his narrowest win in more than two decades.\n\n\"We actually made history in 2010. We came the closest in 24 years to defeating Frank Pallone,\" Little, a former county freeholder and mayor, said in an Aug. 2 interview on NJToday. \"We think we\u2019ve got a great foundation and we want to pick up where we left off.\"\n\nThe 2010 election did mark the closest Pallone victory in two decades, but it wasn\u2019t exactly the historic outcome that Little described in her TV interview.\n\nAs of 2010, the Democratic congressman was only first elected 22 years beforehand -- not \"24 years,\" as Little claimed. Yet even over those 22 years, Pallone\u2019s margin of victory in 2010 was not the closest. He had tighter victories in his first two elections for a two-year House seat.\n\nHere\u2019s how the election results break down:\n\nWhen Republicans took control of the House in 2010, Pallone narrowly defeated Little by 16,520 votes to continue representing the Sixth Congressional District. Little\u2019s candidacy was backed by the Tea Party movement, which played a key role in securing wins for GOP House candidates across the country.\n\nThe close election in 2010 was a stark change from most of Pallone's preceding victories. Just in 2008, the congressman had won by more than 86,000 votes for the largest margin of victory in his career. In fact, the 2010 election represented the closest Pallone victory in 20 years.\n\nBut in 1988 and 1990, the congressman faced even closer calls.\n\nPallone defeated Republican Joseph Azzolina in 1988 by 9,545 votes for his first two-year term. In 1990, Pallone tallied 4,170 more votes than Republican Paul Kapalko.\n\nThe following chart shows Pallone\u2019s GOP challengers and margins of victory since winning his first two-year seat in 1988.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\n\nRepublican challenger\n\nPallone\u2019s margin of victory\n\n\n\n2010\n\nAnna Little\n\n16,520\n\n\n\n2008\n\nRobert McLeod\n\n86,608\n\n\n\n2006\n\nLeigh-Ann Bellew\n\n55,076\n\n\n\n2004\n\nSylvester Fernandez\n\n83,039\n\n\n\n2002\n\nRic Medrow\n\n48,900\n\n\n\n2000\n\nBrian Kennedy\n\n79,244\n\n\n\n1998\n\nMichael Ferguson\n\n22,922\n\n\n\n1996\n\nSteven Corodemus\n\n51,233\n\n\n\n1994\n\nMike Herson\n\n33,635\n\n\n\n1992\n\nJoseph Kyrillos\n\n17,317\n\n\n\n1990\n\nPaul Kapalko\n\n4,170\n\n\n\n1988\n\nJoseph Azzolina\n\n9,545\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor trivia buffs out there, you\u2019ll notice that Kyrillos -- Pallone\u2019s 1992 challenger -- is the GOP candidate for U.S. Senate this year, looking to unseat Democratic U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez in the general election.\n\nOur ruling\n\nIn a TV interview, Little claimed: \"We actually made history in 2010. We came the closest in 24 years to defeating Frank Pallone.\"\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that Pallone\u2019s victory over Little in 2010 was one of the closest wins of his career, but the timing of Little\u2019s claim is off.\n\nThe congressman\u2019s margin of victory represented his tightest win in 20 years -- not 24 years -- and the third-closest finish of all his races for a two-year House seat. Pallone won by even fewer votes in 1988 and 1990.\n\nWe rate the statement False.\n\nTo comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10591"}
