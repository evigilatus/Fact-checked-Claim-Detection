Later, she declared:\n\"Wisconsin uses voting machines that have been outlawed. They are illegal to use them because they are so prone to tampering and hacking. They are an invitation, really, for malfeasance. Those are used in the state of Wisconsin.\"\nIt seems like something more serious than a recount would be under way if outlawed voting machines had been used to help Republican Donald Trump win, if not in a landslide, the White House.\nStein\u2019s campaign told us the candidate was actually referring to California banning electronic, touch-screen voting machines, but acknowledged that the machines are not banned in Wisconsin.\nHmmm.\nLegal in Wisconsin\nIn 2004, California\u2019s secretary of state banned the use of a particular brand of electronic voting machines because of security and reliability concerns and decertified others until steps could be taken to upgrade their security. Part of the concern was the touch-screen machines didn\u2019t provide a paper trail at the time of voting.\nIn Wisconsin, the vast majority of voting machines are optical readers. Voters fill out a paper ballot and feed it into the machine, which then electronically records the vote.\nA small percentage of votes in Wisconsin are cast on touch-screen machines -- but those in use here do generate a paper record for each ballot cast.\nAll voting equipment in Wisconsin has been approved by the Wisconsin Election Commission (or one of its predecessors), Kevin Kennedy, Wisconsin\u2019s former elections director, told us.\nAnd in order to be approved, the equipment had to first pass national testing standards. Before 2006, the equipment was tested under the auspices of the National Association of Election Directors (NASED). Since 2006, testing has been done under the auspices of the U.S Elections Assistance Commission, a federal agency.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin LeMahieu\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a TV interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It takes quite a while on Election Day to load those ballots, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are no federal requirements that states must use certain machines, said Lawrence Norden, deputy director of the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center for Justice.\nIn other words, each state decides what\u2019s legal.\nOur rating\nStein said: \"Wisconsin uses voting machines that are outlawed, they are illegal.\"\nCalifornia banned electronic, touch-screen machines. But the touch-screen machines that are used by a distinct minority of voters in Wisconsin are approved by the Wisconsin Election Commission. They\u2019re legal.\nFor a statement that is false and ridiculous, we rate Stein\u2019s claim Pants on Fire.\n\u00a0\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ac38ea9a-665f-447d-9e20-91c6282b9994\nMore factchecks on the voting process\n\u27a4 Trump said: \"Wisconsin is one of several states where you can change your early ballot if you think you've made a mistake.\" Our rating: True. As long as you meet the deadline, several days before election day, you can \"spoil\" your original ballot and cast a new one.\n\u27a4 Did an election clerk in Green Bay refuse to allow early voting on the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay campus because she \"was afraid it would help Democrats,\" showing \"outrageous partisan bias\"? Half True. Yes, she was concerned about favoring Democrats, but there were other reasons, too, for not opening an early voting site.\n\u27a4 Also Half True was a claim by comedian Amy Schumer that \"anyone who knows you can just\" look it up to \"see if you voted.\" Generally speaking, an individual\u2019s voting history is a public record, though how easy it is to access can vary.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05843"}
