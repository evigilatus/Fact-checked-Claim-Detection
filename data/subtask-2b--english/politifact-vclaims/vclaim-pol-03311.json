Nate Walker.\n\n\nThe Republican from Kirksville told MissouriNet\u00a0that Speaker Todd Richardson, R-Poplar Bluff, tried to persuade him to change his mind, but Walker wouldn\u2019t budge. One reason, Walker said, was because \"(charter schools in Missouri) are actually failing in greater capacity than public school systems.\"\n\n\nBut are they? Walker didn\u2019t provide a definition for what he meant by failing, and the Missouri education department doesn\u2019t have a specific definition, either. However, after looking at the education department's performance reviews, the data shows that charter schools are performing about the same as nearby public schools.\n\n\nDefinitions of failing\n\n\nWhen PolitiFact called Walker and asked him where he got his data, he said he got it from a \"lot of different things,\" and began providing some numbers.\n\n\n\"Sixty-four percent of Missouri Charter Schools have failed or are failing,\" he said, without citing the source of these statistics. \"Since 1999, we\u2019ve had 59 charter schools open in the state. Thirty-eight of the 59 charter schools have failed or are failing students.\"\n\n\nHowever, according to the data from the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, for the 2016-17 year there were 72 individual charter schools within 39 charter school districts. And since 1999, the year after\u00a0charter school law was enacted, there have been\u00a063 charter school districts,\u00a0and 21 \u2014 or 33 percent \u2014 have closed.\n\n\nWhen we asked Walker in a phone interview what his definition was for \"failing,\" this was his response:\n\n\n\"Well, they\u2019re not meeting the standards of the (education department). You go check the facts, I\u2019m not a reporter. You\u2019ve got a degree in journalism and understand factual information, but I stand by my comments, and all you need to do is go do your research and find I\u2019m absolutely right. Probably more than right.\"\n\n\nWe went to the education department to learn more. Sarah Potter, the communications coordinator for the department, wrote in an email, \"There are no parameters in state statute for a \u2018failing\u2019 charter school.\"\n\n\nHowever, the department does issue an Annual Performance Review score for both charter and traditional public schools to determine how well they\u2019re educating the students.\u00a0Charter schools are independent public schools freed from certain regulations. They are also subject to other rules defined by their contracts with their sponsors, such as universities, who then hold charter schools accountable for their results instead of the state.\n\n\nThis performance review\u00a0takes into account standardized test scores, attendance rates and graduation rates along with financial status and leadership stability.\n\n\nThere are four levels of accreditation. \"Accredited with Distinction\" and \"Accredited\" signify that the school or district is meeting performance standards. Schools or districts must earn a 70 percent or higher on their performance review to earn those classifications. \"Provisionally Accredited\" and \"Unaccredited\" indicate that the school or district isn\u2019t meeting performance standards and earned a performance review score below 70 percent and below 50 percent, respectively.\n\n\nIn fact, in our phone interview with Walker, he did mention accreditation, saying: \"Of the 38 charter schools (districts) currently open for business, 11 have been deemed Provisionally Accredited, six would have been deemed Unaccredited and four were too new to receive a score. Right now 46 percent of the active charter schools would be classified as Accredited.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese numbers are correct \u2014 though there were 39 districts and not 38 as Walker said \u2014\u00a0according to the\u00a0latest data available at the state education department\u2019s website.\n\n\nFor comparison, 99 percent of traditional public school districts earned Accredited or above while only 46 percent of charter school districts earned that status. It\u2019s not looking so good for Missouri charter schools.\n\n\nCharter schools vs.\u00a0traditional public schools\n\n\nNot so fast, said Doug Thaman, the executive director of the Missouri Charter Public School Association.\n\n\n\"One of the concerns we have is that when statements are made like (the one) Walker made, that\u2019s a comparison of charter schools to an entire school district, and that is just not a true comparison,\" he said. \"You can\u2019t compare a single school to an entire district or to the entire state.\"\n\n\nWhat Thaman means is that performance scores are assigned to both individual schools and the districts in which several schools reside, and the scores are often different. He also pointed out that charter schools,\u00a0which have to accept any student who applies, often educate lower-performing students whose needs haven't been met by traditional public schools, so charter schools score poorly on the performance review because they're helping students who score below grade level catch up. \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\nThaman suggested it would be better to compare the performance score of individual charter schools to individual competitor public schools within the same district. So we did.\n\n\nIn Kansas City, the charter schools reside inside public school district Kansas City 33, which had an overall performance score of 70 percent, which is also the lowest score to earn an Accredited or above rating.\n\n\nBoth the Kansas City charter schools and traditional public schools in the district had 32 sites that were assigned a performance score in the 2015-16 school year, But more individual charter schools \u2014 21\u2014 were performing at or above district\u2019s rate of 70 percent than individual public schools \u2014 12. And even when you compare charter school districts\u2019 performance scores to Kansas City 33\u2019s performance score, over 60 percent of the charter school districts meets or exceeds the district's score.\n\n\nSo overall, it appears that most charter schools in Kansas City are doing just fine when compared to Kansas City 33 district and its schools.\n\n\nNow let\u2019s take a look at St. Louis. This one is a little harder to compare because the public school district the charter schools are located within \u2014 the St. Louis City district \u2014 has 71 sites with performance scores, compared to only 22 charter school sites. St. Louis City district has an overall performance score of 74.6 percent.\n\n\nJust as with Kansas City, it appears that individual St. Louis charter schools are performing about the same as their public school counterparts. Fifty percent of charter schools and 48 percent of public schools earned an Accredited rating, or a 70 percent performance score.\n\n\nHowever, when comparing districts\u2019 scores, the scales tip toward the public schools. St. Louis City district has an overall score of 74.6 percent.\u00a0Nine charter school districts, or 56 percent,\u00a0score below that. However, 57 percent of the traditional public schools fall below their districts\u2019 performance rate.\n\n\nOur ruling\n\n\nRep. Walker said, \"(Charter schools in Missouri) are actually failing in a greater capacity than the public school systems.\"\n\n\nNeither Walker nor the education department gave a definition for a failing charter school. And although charter school districts performance scores are nowhere near the 99 percent of public school districts that are Accredited, current charter schools are performing on par with with the public schools in their city.\n\n\nWalker\u2019s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate this claim as Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03311"}
