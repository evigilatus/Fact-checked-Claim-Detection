Its headline says: \"FORMER PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER HAS ENDORSED BERNIE SANDERS.\"\nCarter supported Sanders\u2019 bid in 2016, but he did not formally endorse him during his run then and has not endorsed any candidate so far in the 2020 presidential primary.\u00a0\nThe blog post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

At one point during the event, Carter says: \"Can y\u2019all see why I voted for him?\"\u00a0\u00a0\nBut the recent blog post being shared on Facebook falsely plants Carter\u2019s comment as a 2020 endorsement for Sanders, changing a line from the 2017 article, which originally said: \"Carter previously stayed mostly mum about the 2016 election\" to \"Carter previously stayed mostly mum about the 2020 election.\"\nYears ago Carter said he voted for Sanders in the 2016 primary. He has not endorsed him, or anyone else yet, in 2020.\u00a0\nPants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18091"}
