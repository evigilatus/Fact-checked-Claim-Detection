One: $250 fine to own a plastic bag if the ban goes thru.\" Second: \"Classware: a fine of $250 if you are caught with a plastic bag coming out of a store. Anybody's plastic bag? #5vtshow.\" Polyte Fact Oregon knows that under the proposed legislation there will be 5 cents of fees per paper bag. But a $250 fine just for possession of a bag? A plastic bag cop? Those were interesting concepts. Taft received one pants on fire and another liar from Polyte Fact Oregon, so we understand her reluctance to talk to us about her tweeting. * (reactions to our question asked more questions than answered.) However, we did some scrutiny and found that the fine of $250 was actually rooted: it was the punishment imposed on the retailer - not the shopper - for continuing to hand over single-use plastic bags upon exit. Palmer Mason, a legislative analyst with the Oregon Environmental Quality Department, said that if the ban became law, the Agency was likely to use the first year not for a fine, but to educate retailers on a new ban on bags. \"This is a huge behavioral change. This affects most retail transactions in Oregon and will take time for consumers, retailers, and industry to change their behavior and change what they've been doing for many years.\" However, Mason wants retailers to know that DEQ is not afraid to violate the blatant first-year violators. In order for the original language of the Senate Bill 536 to be fully fair with Taft, it states that \"DEQ may impose a civil penalty on a person who violates article 2 - but again, article 2 applies to retailers and what institutions may or may not provide in terms of exit bags. Before tweeting, an amendment dated 3 March explains the original draft law to delete the words \"person\" and replace the words \"a fragmentation institution.\" Taffet's right when you say there's a $250 fine for abuse of plastic bag. But her second tweet, which she partly reads -- a $250 fine if you get caught with a plastic bag coming out of a store -- gives the impression that an individual shopper will be fined for having a plastic bag. That's not true. We would have given Taft a tweet of pants on fire if she had taken away the fine amount of thin air. We can hardly make that clear, in that the statement contained an element of truth - the $250 fine - but it did not mention that it applied to retailers, which would have given a different impression. But instead, we appreciate her statement a mistake. The shopper who \"teachs with a plastic bag\" doesn't deserve fine, and in fact, he may not even deserve a retailer's fine because shoppers are allowed to bring their own bags. The DEQ system officials will not cross-check the exits of the supermarket to the users of single-use plastic bags. The statement is not accurate. In one interview on January 31, 2021, John Kerry said that Hurricane Harvey \"more water fell in Houston in five days than he went over Niagara Falls in one year.\"", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13177"}
