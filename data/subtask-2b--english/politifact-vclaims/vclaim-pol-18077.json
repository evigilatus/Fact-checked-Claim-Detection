Three people wear medical face masks, worry visible in their eyes. Next to those two images is one more that reads simply \"5G\" \u2014\u00a0 a reference to the fifth-generation of wireless networking technology.\nThese ominous pictures accompany this headline on a story being shared widely on Facebook:\n\"Coronavirus Hoax: Fake Virus Pandemic Fabricated to Cover-Up Global Outbreak of 5G Syndrome.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nPlease strike this claim from your list of things to worry about: This is just one more coronavirus assertion without evidence. As we\u2019ve mentioned before, the best available information is that this virus started with an animal.\nThe article\nThe article appears on the Millennium Report, an anti-5G website that includes a section on the rollout of 5G, which \"greatly endangers\" the health of\u00a0 \"every person in the USA.\"\nThe article cites no verifiable evidence of this claim. Instead, it alleges that the coronavirus discovered in Wuhan, China, was \"staged to cover-up the public health crisis caused by the intensive 5G roll-out in Wuhan in 2019.\" It attributes the information to an unnamed \"intelligence analyst and former U.S. Army officer.\"\nWhat is 5G?\n5G is the latest upgrade to wireless systems that deliver data to mobile phones and other devices. As in, faster, faster, faster. It involves the federal government selling wireless spectrum used for the technology and more cell towers being located in populated rather than rural areas.\u00a0\nIs there reason to worry about possible health effects? Perhaps.\nJoel Moskowitz, director of the Center for Family and Community Health in the School of Public Health at the University of California, Berkeley, supports a moratorium on 5G development. He wrote in Scientific American that there could be health effects and that research needs to be funded.\u00a0\nBut other reports say fears are overblown:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 25, 2021 in a blog post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWHO now saying you do not need to wear a mask.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The vast majority of evidence says there\u2019s no reason to pause deployments.\" \u2014 Rod Waterhouse, an electrical engineer, wireless-communications entrepreneur and editor of a report on 5G, speaking to the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers\n\n\n\"There\u2019s little reason to think 5G frequencies are any more harmful than other types of electromagnetic radiation, like visible light.\" \u2014 Wired magazine\n\n\n\"The 5G Health Hazard That Isn\u2019t \u2014 How one scientist and his inaccurate chart led to unwarranted fears of wireless technology.\" \u2014 New York Times headline\n\n\nThese concerns about 5G aside, there is no evidence that the coronavirus has anything to do with wireless technology.\nAnimal origins\nThe current coronavirus \u2014 which causes the respiratory disease known as COVID-19 \u2014 is spreading internationally. As of March 8, 2020, it had been detected in more than 100,000 people in more than 100 countries, including in the United States.\nHere\u2019s what we know about how it emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China:\nCOVID-19 \"is a zoonotic virus\" \u2014 that is, it was spread from animals to humans \u2014 according to a report from 25 international experts, including some from China and the U.S., convened by the World Health Organization.\u00a0\nBats \"appear to be the reservoir of COVID-19 virus,\" but the intermediate host or hosts \u2014 that is, how it went from bats to humans \u2014 has not been identified.\u00a0\nSuch viruses often originate in bats, although they sometimes can jump to another species before infecting humans. Chinese researchers have found a possible link between COVID-19 and pangolins, a mammal entirely covered in scales.\nEarly on, many of the patients in Wuhan had some link to a large seafood and live animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Later, a growing number of patients reportedly did not have exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread.\nOur ruling\n\nThe headline of an article shared on Facebook claimed, without verifiable evidence: \"Coronavirus Hoax: Fake Virus Pandemic Fabricated to Cover-Up Global Outbreak of 5G Syndrome.\"\nWorld experts say the virus originated in an animal \u2014 perhaps in a bat that transmitted the virus to another animal, and then to humans.\nWe rate the claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18077"}
