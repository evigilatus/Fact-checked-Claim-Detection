I don\u2019t know about you, but Barack Obama ought to be impeached,\" Dewhurst said, according to the Observer. \"Not only for trampling on our liberties, but what he did in Benghazi is just a crime.\"\nAfterward, Dewhurst elaborated on his criticism of the administration\u2019s handling of the September 2012 attack in Benghazi, which killed Americans including the U.S. ambassador to Libya, Chris Stephens. \"I\u2019m very concerned about Benghazi, in which all of the national news reporting indicated that live video was streaming into the White House,\" Dewhurst told Observer reporter Christopher Hooks. \"That means that there was an overhead platform, probably a drone in the area. At least that\u2019s what it tells me,\" he said. \"And for not mobilizing some response to protect the ambassador and those three Americans is just outrageous to me. Just outrageous.\"\nWe asked Dewhurst for the basis of his reference to a live video feed of the attacks reaching the White House and didn\u2019t hear back.\nIt didn\u2019t take us long to find that the \"Benghazi live stream\" claim has already been debunked by the Snopes.com \"urban legends\" website.\nThat Snopes post, last updated Nov. 1, 2012, traces the claim to an Oct. 24, 2012, Forbes magazine op-ed article, which opened: \"Just one hour after the seven-hour-long terrorist attacks upon the U.S. consulate in Benghazi began, our commander-in-chief, vice president, secretary of defense and their national security team gathered together in the Oval Office listening to phone calls from American defenders desperately under siege and watching real-time video of developments from a drone circling over the site. \u00a0Yet they sent no military aid that might have intervened in time to save lives.\"\nThe Forbes article did not provide a source for writer Larry Bell\u2019s reference to real-time video.\nIn its article, Snopes noted that a CBS News story also posted Oct. 24, 2012, stated that the FBI and State Department had reviewed video from security cameras that captured the attack on the consulate. The CBS News report continued: \"The audio feed of the attack was being monitored in real time in Washington by diplomatic security official Charlene Lamb. CBS News has learned that video of the assault was recovered 20 days later from the more than 10 security cameras at the compound. The government security camera footage of the attack was in the possession of local Libyans until the week of Oct. 1,\" CBS News said.\nEarlier, on Oct. 12, 2012, the Daily Beast quoted two unidentified U.S. intelligence officials as saying that video taken the night of the attacks, showing a military-style assault took place, had been recovered the week before from the site of the attacks.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in remarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only in the Third World do you see this habitual use of prosecutions of former leaders.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Obama administration has been studying the videos, taken from closed-circuit cameras throughout the Benghazi consulate\u2019s four-building compound, for clues about who was responsible for the attack and how it played out,\" the story said.\nThe story did not mention any live stream into the White House, though it said that in \"addition to the footage from the consulate cameras, the U.S. government is also poring over video taken from an overhead U.S. surveillance drone that arrived for the final hour of the night battle at the consulate compound and nearby annex.\"\nOur search for news stories on such a live stream, using the Nexis database, led us to an Oct. 29, 2012, Slate news story noting a claim by Charles Woods, whose son, Tyrone, died in the attacks, that the White House watched the attacks on a live stream over seven hours. The story also notes the CBS News report of a drone flying over the fatal scene hours after the attacks began. Slate quoted a White House spokesman, Tommy Vietor, as saying: \"No one watched video of the attack at the White House as it happened.\"\nSeparately, as documented by Erik Wemple, who writes a \"reported opinion blog\" on the news media for The Washington Post, Fox News commentator Sean Hannity repeatedly incorrectly stated that the State Department watched live video as the attacks occurred. In a Jan. 23, 2013, news story, Wemple said that earlier that day, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was asked before a House committee about live video feeds to the agency and replied: \"There was no monitor, there was no real time.\"\nEarlier, on Oct. 26, 2012, Fox News said it had learned that \"there were two military surveillance drones redirected to Benghazi shortly after the attack on the consulate began. They were already in the vicinity. The second surveillance craft was sent to relieve the first drone, perhaps due to fuel issues. Both were capable of sending real-time visuals back to U.S. officials in Washington, D.C. Any U.S. official or agency with the proper clearance, including the White House Situation Room, State Department, CIA, Pentagon and others, could call up that video in real time on their computers.\" The story did not say any video was watched inside the agencies.\nOur ruling\nDewhurst said live video of the Benghazi attacks reached the White House as the attacks occurred.\nThat\u2019s not confirmed by news reports we found, while the White House said in October 2012 that no one there watched a live video feed.\nGiven that this claim has been debunked for about a year, we see it as incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!\n\nPANTS ON FIRE \u2013 The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08757"}
