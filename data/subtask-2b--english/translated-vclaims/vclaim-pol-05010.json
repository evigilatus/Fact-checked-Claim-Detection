Cruz' father was with Lee Harvey Oswald before Oswald was shot. I mean, this whole thing is ridiculous. What is this, right, before he was shot? And no one even mentions that, \"Tramb said on Fox and friends in the morning of Indiana's critical elementary school. \"What was he doing - what was he doing with Lee Harvey Oswald just before he died? Before the shooting? It's terrible.\" Is it true that Rafael Cruz was with Oswald before the assassination, or was Trump's charge of the bomb ridiculous? We don't have the Trump campaign anymore. Cruz ripped Trump apart and called the billionaire an unethical liar and a sick liar and ironically admitted that his father had killed John Kennedy, the secret Elvis and Jimmy Hoffa buried in his backyard. In an interview with ABC, Rafael Cruz called the prosecution \"fucking\" and \"the Donald Trump tradition.\" The charge of Trump appears to be based on a national survey report alleging that Rafael Cruz is the man standing near Oswald in a picture from 1963. But the technical experts told Bolivi Fruitte that such a firm conclusion could not be reached given the quality of the photograph, and many historians at that time told us that they had never seen Cruz's name come in a relationship with Oswald. A picture of 1963 on the left shows Lee Harvey Oswald (left) and an unidentified man named by the National Investigator is Rafael Cruz, the father of Ted Cruz. A confirmed picture of Cruz (in 1959 in glasses) is right. In her report, Oswald's photographs were based on the distribution of leaflets in support of the Phil Castro in New Orleans on August 16, 1963, about four months before Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 2006. Two photo experts hired by the newspaper: Mitch Goldstone of Scanmetos, a digital photo service, and Carol Lieberman, a forensic expert witness, said that another man in the picture seemed to be a young Raphael Cruz, according to McClace. We have not been able to independently verify the authenticity of these experts, as neither Goldstone nor Lieberman has returned to us. When we contacted Kairos, the Miami facial recognition company, Chief Technology Officer Cole Calistra, was skeptical about the claims of positive identity. Calistra told Bolivi Fact that the photos were too inappropriate to \"do a proper match one way or another.\" James Wyman, former director of the American National Center for Vital Tests in the Clinton Administration, said that the correct analysis required two facial images on the fronts. \"Without such images, no professional facial examiner would be willing to give an opinion,\" he said. However, we tested Lucien Gendrot's independent programmer using API, which is known as Kairos' face. The program was unable to verify a match between pictures of an unidentified man next to Oswald and Rafael Cruz, even at a low threshold of 25 percent. In short, as Snoops wrote in April 2016's analysis of similar allegations, low-resolution images are essentially \"of dark-haired young people with a similar haircut.\" That's a guess, not a clue. Did Cruz and Oswald run in the same circles? In his 2016 book, Time for Work, Rafael Cruz admitted that he was an early supporter of Fidel Castro. Cruz was upset against the former leader of Cuba, dictator Fulgencio Batista, which resulted in the beating of Batista's forces in 1957. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 On January 11, 2021, Cruz eventually applied to universities in the United States, accepted by the University of Texas, and left in a ferry to Key West, where he went to Austin. He attended classes and worked as a dishwasher, a story that his son often repeated after the campaign. In Cuba, Batista fled under the pressure of Castro's forces, and Castro took power at the beginning of 1959. Later that year, during the summer holiday of Cruz from college, he returned to Cuba and \"shocked\" because of the nation's transition to communism. He left, and never returned, leaving his close relatives behind. In the spring of 1962, Cruz wrote, prior to a job with IBM in Dallas, where he lived for a while with his wife and two daughters from his first marriage. At some point, Cruz moved to New Orleans to get a different job, although the timetable is unclear from his book. In New Orleans, Cruz met his second wife, Eleanor. They had a son, the next presidential candidate, in 1970, in the Canadian city of Calgary. So Cruz checks out two boxes related to Oswald -- a residence in New Orleans (where Oswald lived and where she took the picture in question), a period in Dallas (where Oswald also lived, where Kennedy was murdered, and an interest in Cuba. But there's nothing to suggest that this is more than a simple coincidence. In fact, historians of this period say that it's unlikely that someone like Cruz would hang out with someone like Oswald. Cruz was already going to be anti-communist for years when he was photographed with Oswald. Given that Oswald was distributing publications to the Committee on the Exhibition for Cuba - a group in favour of Castro - the partnership between the two men would have no meaning in her face. In addition, Oswald is believed to have been more of a lone wolf than a founding man. The report of the Warren Commission, which examined the murder of Kennedy by his widow, Marina Oswald, quoted \"her husband participated in the activities of the Fair Play Commission of Cuba for the main purposes of declaring himself. He wanted to be arrested. I think he wanted to go into the papers, so he could know.\" This interpretation is true of Van Goss, the historian of Franklin College and Marshall, and the author of the boys' website: Cuba, America of the Cold War and the creation of a new left. Joss said that the Fair Play Commission of Cuba \"has virtually ceased to exist in the middle of 1963,\" when it took the picture. As active as the group was at all at the time, he said, it could have been in the Great City of New York, not a city in the South. In other words, whatever Oswald was doing that day in New Orleans was probably an independent effort to \"defense something\" that would attract his attention, as Gus said. \"It sounds like a concoction,\" said Joss. Other experts in this period agreed that Oswald and Cruz were unlikely to have met. According to Maria Cristina Garcia, a historian of Cornell University and author in Havana, United States of America: Cuban exiles and Cuban Americans in South Florida, 1959-1994. \"You can be sure that if there's any shit on Rafael Cruz, Castro's government will find it and release him.\" William M. L\u00e9ogrand, Professor of the Government of the United States University and author of the Back Channel to Cuba: The Hidden History of Negotiations between Washington and Havana, agreed. He said, \"I've never encountered the name of Mr. Cruz as a pro-Castro activist.\" David Abraham, a professor of law at the University of Miami, agreed that the function seemed unlikely. \"I don't know any evidence that would put Cruz in Oswald's world,\" said Abraham. \"The fair game for the Cuban Commission was a combination of ideological supporters of socialist transformation and romantic innocents. Whatever Oswald thinks, Cruz wasn't any of these, so I doubt they would have met.\" Stephen Beechloss, author of \"Armed Man and Mother: Lee Harvey Oswald,\" \"Margaret Oswald\" and \"The Making of Assassins,\" finds nothing of the supposed connection. \"Any attempt to find a more meaningful connection that somehow involved Father Cruz. Seems strange at best,\" said Beechlos. Our verdict, Trump, said Rafael Cruz was with Lee Harvey Oswald before President John Kennedy was assassinated. The only evidence of this allegation is an unclear picture showing Oswald with a man who might have a resemblance to Cruz. But experts tell Bolivi Fuckett that the picture is so degraded that it doesn't give much confidence. At the same time, many experts around the world in the early 1960s who advocated Castro said that they had never seen evidence of Cruz's association with Oswald and considered Trump's claim unreasonable at best and absurd at worst. We're assessing the allegation of pants on fire. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c3361f8f-01084-4c22-874e-6ca77257190b", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05010"}
