Brown Buck is a little special about Romney's attitude. Romney did not support the plan and published an article in the July-August issue of Foreign Affairs, in which he said he was opposed to the concept. On January 13, 2021, General David Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request to use marines to launch security, and said, \"We are not working for you.\" Samantha Butterman wrote on January 17, 2021: \"Today the nation's attention is focused on Iraq.\" All Americans want American troops to come home as soon as possible. But moving away now or dividing Iraq into parts and moving away later would pose serious risks to the United States and the world. Iran could seize the Shia South, al-Qa'idah could control the Sunni West, and Kurdish nationalism could destabilize the border with Turkey. This may result in a regional conflict, perhaps even requiring the return of American troops under much worse conditions.\"", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00341"}
