We also didn\u2019t find the tweet searching those accounts on Twitter.\u00a0\nLastly, we couldn\u2019t find any news coverage corroborating this Facebook post \u2014 which, again, was allegedly from May. Ocasio-Cortez is a highly scrutinized elected official and if she said something as inflammatory as what appears in the post, it would have been widely reported.If you Google the quote, the top hit is a Snopes fact-check saying the quote is fabricated.
