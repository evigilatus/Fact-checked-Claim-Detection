But Harris herself is a natural-born citizen and eligible to be president of the United States.\u00a0\nBack when Harris was still a Democratic presidential candidate, we fact-checked a similar claim: that she was ineligible to run for president.

At the end of a bio on the school\u2019s website, he notes his citizenship status. \"Jamaica (by birth); USA (by naturalization).\"\nKamala Harris\u2019 mother, Shyamala Harris, was born in Chennai, India, and moved to California after graduating from the University of Delhi to pursue a doctorate in nutrition and endocrinology at Berkeley. She met Donald Harris at the university and the couple married, separating around the time Kamala Harris was five and divorcing a few years later, according to \"The Truths We Hold.\"\nHarris lived in California until she was in middle school, when she moved to Montreal after her mother was offered a teaching position at McGill University. She went to college at Howard University in Washington D.C.\nThe U.S. Constitution says that \"no person except a natural born citizen, or a citizen of the United States, at the time of the adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible for the office of President.\"\nExperts say that Harris meets the definition of \"natural born citizen.\" Other federal laws and legal opinions to know for this fact-check:\u00a0\n\u2022 The 14th Amendment, which says that \"all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.\"\n\u2022 8 U.S. Code \u00a7 1401, which says people born in the United States are \"nationals and citizens.\"\n\u2022 The 1898 Supreme Court decision in the Wong Kim Ark case, which ruled that people born on U.S. soil (with a few exceptions that aren\u2019t relevant in Harris\u2019 case) qualify for citizenship under the 14th Amendment.\u00a0\nSarah Duggin, a Catholic University law professor, told us: \"Her birth in the United States, to someone other than a member of a foreign diplomatic corps or otherwise not subject to U.S. jurisdiction, makes her a U.S. citizen. \u2026 There is no reason to look at where her parents came from, how long her parents were U.S. residents before she was born, or where she was raised.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nSeveral other fact-checking organizations \u2014\u00a0AFP and the Associated Press among them \u2014\u00a0have also looked into these claims and agree that they are inaccurate.\nWe rate this Facebook post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17084"}
