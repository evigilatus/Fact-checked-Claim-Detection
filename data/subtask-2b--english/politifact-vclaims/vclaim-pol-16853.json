(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nLet\u2019s see how that summary lines up with Johnson\u2019s piece.\nWhat the column said\nThe headline implies Johnson is calling for a widespread \u2014\u00a0or even comprehensive \u2014\u00a0return to work.\nThe Johnson piece in USA Today, published March 29, 2020, makes clear at the start he is not calling for any such immediate return to normalcy. Here is how it reads:\nI\u2019m not aware of any public official, including President Donald Trump, who is calling for a complete opening of the U.S. economy.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Steineke\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembly Republicans \u201chave come to the table\u201d and were part of \u201cgive and take\u201d compromise on a coronavirus bill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat more people are saying is that as we learn more about COVID-19, we should evaluate the total societal cost of this awful disease and try to put things into perspective. \u2026\nImagine the potential psychological and human toll if this shutdown continues indefinitely, unemployment reaches 20% or higher, as some now predict, and we sink into a deep recession or depression.\nJohnson says social distancing \"should continue until this outbreak is under control.\"\nBut he did also reference death being unavoidable. Here\u2019s the full context for that line:\nEvery premature death is a tragedy, but death is an unavoidable part of life. More than 2.8 million die each year \u2014 nearly 7,700 a day. The 2017-18 flu season was exceptionally bad, with 61,000 deaths attributed to it. Can you imagine the panic if those mortality statistics were attributed to a new virus and reported nonstop?\nJohnson goes on to call for reversing the current labeling of \"essential businesses,\" saying we should instead determine nonessential business \"that pose a risk for coronavirus spread.\" He said those could be shut down and financial support provided to the employees and businesses until they can re-open.\nThe brief story linked in the Facebook post describes Johnson\u2019s position more accurately than the headline, though it also opens by labeling him \"the living embodiment of clueless privilege.\"\nOur ruling\nA viral Facebook post said Johnson is saying \"Americans should go back to work, because 'death is an unavoidable part of life.'\"\nJohnson did use the line about death being unavoidable, but the headline exaggerates his position, implying he thinks all or most people should go back to work. He explicitly says he supports social distancing and keeping some businesses closed at this point.\nWe rate this Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16853"}
