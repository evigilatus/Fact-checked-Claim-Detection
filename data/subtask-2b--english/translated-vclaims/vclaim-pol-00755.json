The bill was eventually passed by the House of Representatives, largely on party lines, before becoming a member of the Senate. During the debate in the House of Representatives, a democratic delegate, Andrew Baird, argued that approval of the bill could prevent students from registering in the first place. \"Successful states\" said Bird, according to a WVNews.com account. \"We must encourage people to come to our state, not be afraid to come to our state.\" Was there a significant decrease in registration in states that exceeded the campus pregnancy bill? We've had a good look. When we contacted Bird, he referred to an article in the Houston Chronicle about the low enrolment of international students in Texas, a state that enacted a campus law. \"The four-year international applications of Texas public universities have fallen over the past year by at least 10,000, a 12.5% decrease from last fall, according to Houston Cronkel's review of university data,\" the article said. The article cited the clarifications that could be provided by experts, including Jeff Fuller, former admission manager at Houston University. The most prominent explanation was \"slow global economy,\" \"big competition from other countries,\" and \"President Donald Trump's anti-immigrant speech,\" which Fuller said, \"make some international students uncomfortable.\" The lesser explanation in the article was that the Texas campus held the law, with Fuller saying it was \"a point of contention for some applicants.\" However, this is not a strong indication of support for Bird's assertion. Bird said \"states,\" but Texas is only one state. Nor did he specify the registration of international students, which is what the article did. It is also not clear that carrying the campus was the main factor that pushed Texas down. So we decided to take a broader look at the states that have enacted the campus. Pedro Rivero, spokesman for the American University Association, said that his group did not have regular data on the issue. So we looked at the numbers ourselves, case after case. According to the National Congress of State Legislatures, 16 states explicitly prohibit the carrying of a concealed weapon on a campus, while in 23 other states the decision is left to each college or university. For example, the University of Liberty in Lynchburg, Va, allows for the holding of campuses despite the absence of government law. In the meantime, Tennessee allows for the right of faculty members but not students or the public. Here, we will focus on the remaining 10 states that have either legislation or judicial provisions allowing the carrying of hidden weapons on campus after high school: Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Idaho, Kansas, Mississippi, Oregon, Texas, Utah and Wisconsin. Private schools are not included in the data because they are not required to follow the same guidelines. What does the data show? When we looked at the state data situation, we found that, at best, enrolment trends at the State University were inconsistent. Some states have already seen an increase after the entry into force of the Act. We didn't evaluate Arkansas, because we didn't find data for the relevant period. Four states -- Colorado, Kansas, Oregon, Wisconsin -- experienced declines after crossing, although they were rather small. The Colorado campus holds the law and entered into force in 2010. Between that year and 2015, the last available year, enrolment fell by 5.8 per cent. Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" January 26, 2012, in Kansas, the law was only applied on campus a little over a year ago. Between 2017 and 2018, the drop in school enrolment was 1.1 per cent. The State of Oregon initially saw a 2.9 per cent increase in registration in 2011, the year when the campus pregnancy bill came into effect. Since then, registration has decreased by 4.6 per cent. The law on pregnancy entered into force on the University of Wisconsin campus in 2011. As of 2015, the last year available, the enrolment rate has declined by 8.8 per cent. Two states did not have a clear pattern in their registration numbers. In 2010, the law entered into force on the Mississippi campus. For the first year, the number has risen. Registration declined over the next three years and increased again in 2015, the last year for which data are available. Utah saw an increase after the campus pregnancy law came into force in 2004. Since then, there has been a three-year decline, followed by a four-year increase, a further decline in 2012, an increase in 2013 and a further decline in 2014, the latest year for which data are available. In fact, the remaining three states have seen increases in enrolment. Texas promulgated the campus pregnancy law in 2016, but data show an increase of 2.9 in enrolment between 2015 and 2017. The Georgian campus law entered into force in 2017. The enrolment rate has since increased by 2.2 per cent before the law. Finally, the registration rate of Idaho rose by approximately 11 per cent after the law entered into force on campus in 2014. The most recent data on Idaho extends until 2015. In summary, four of the nine states we have considered have experienced somewhat steady declines in registration after the campus pregnancy law came into force, while two have shown no consistent pattern, and three have seen increases in registration. In other words, there was a lot of change, contrary to what Bird said. However, even in the cases of States with a modest decline, it is not clear that arms laws have been the driving force. Many other factors - such as the size of the number of students of the country &apos; s college age, whether universities expand or reduce their offers, and wider economic forces - can affect enrolment numbers. For example, improved economic conditions after the large recession of some students may have led to jobs rather than college enrolment. David Beals, a social scientist from Iowa University studying education, said that it was not impossible to have a relationship between campus pregnancy and low registration, but he had never seen any research on the matter. Bills said, \"A causal relationship between a particular law and registration trends would require a very rigorous research design.\" The level of evidence must be very high. If this search exists now, I am not aware of it.\" Our rule, Bird, said, \"The states that have succeeded have seen a significant drop in registration.\" \u2219 Evidence of this assertion was a newspaper article guessing that the holding of the campus was the reason for the decline in international registration in Texas. But this is a much narrower result than he pointed out - other factors that are equally important, if not better, in claiming to be the engine of that decline. When we looked at the figures on a wider scale, there was no consistent pattern of state registration fluctuations after the enactment of university campus laws. In fact, a small majority of states either saw increases or Zig-Zing's trend line. Even in states where registration has fallen, it is difficult to say that campus pregnancy was the cause. We're assessing his statement wrong.
