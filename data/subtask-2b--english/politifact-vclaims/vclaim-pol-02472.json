And as we noted the last time we fact-checked a similar claim, the tax bill passed last December doesn\u2019t stack up as the largest cut ever.\nOn the eve of its passage, the Joint Committee on Taxation \u2014 Congress\u2019s nonpartisan arbiter of tax analysis \u2014 said the tax bill would cost about $1.5 trillion over 10 years, or about $150 billion a year.\nHow does that compare historically?\nThe Treasury Department has published a list of the biggest tax bills between 1940 and 2012, measured not only by contemporary dollars but also by inflation-adjusted dollars and as a percentage of gross domestic product (a measure of the size of the overall economy).\nDepending on what projection of the current bill you use and what yardstick you measure it by, several bills since 1980 were larger. Here\u2019s the list by inflation-adjusted dollars:\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTax bill\n\n\nInflation-adjusted dollars (per year)\n\n\n\n\nAmerican Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (enacted in 2013)\n\n\n$321 billion\n\n\n\n\nTax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010\n\n\n$210 billion\n\n\n\n\nEconomic Recovery Tax Act of 1981\n\n\n$208 billion\n\n\n\n\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017\n\n\n$150 billion\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nBy this measurement, the recent tax bill ranks as the fourth-biggest since 1940.\nThe Trump-signed legislation falls lower on the list when the cuts are ordered from highest to lowest as a percentage of GDP:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.
