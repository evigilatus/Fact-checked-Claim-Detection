Scott Walker in the 2018 \u00a0election. McCabe, a political activist, is running on a platform of \"principle over party.\"\nWhile we were waiting for the latest cat video to buffer, we decided to check out his claim.\nA look at the numbers\nWhen asked for backup, McCabe pointed to a 2016 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article which cited a study that ranked Wisconsin as 49th for fixed broadband internet speed. Fixed broadband \u00a0encompasses landlines, desktops and laptops -- basically everything except mobile connections.\nSo, McCabe made a broad statement about internet speed, but cited data that looks at only part of the picture -- and ignores a major chunk of internet use.\nTo be sure, the 2016 Speedtest ranking McCabe cited did rank Wisconsin 49th, with a speed of 28.59 megabits per second, when it comes to just broadband speed. But if you look just at mobile, Wisconsin ranked much higher, at 15th place.\nThe study did not include an average of broadband and mobile, but more recent data from Akamai\u2019s 2017 State of the Internet Report, issued in the first quarter of 2017, did combine data from both. That ranking placed Wisconsin 30th for average overall internet speed.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Steineke\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembly Republicans \u201chave come to the table\u201d and were part of \u201cgive and take\u201d compromise on a coronavirus bill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 27, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe asked University of Wisconsin-Madison telecommunications professor emeritus Barry Orton about McCabe\u2019s claim. He said all data on the subject is a bit fuzzy, but said Wisconsin traditionally does not do as well as other states in terms of average speed.\n\"Traditionally, WI has been ranked very low compared to other states, primarily because there are so many rural areas in Wisconsin with almost no internet service,\" Orton said.\nWalker campaign spokesman Austin Altenburg said Walker has done extensive work to boost and strengthen Wisconsin\u2019s broadband system, including creating a $7.68 million dollar grant, the largest in state history, to support broadband expansion. \u00a0\nAccording to Altenburg this grant will provide 1,600 business locations and 18,000 residential locations with high-speed internet.\nWhen we told McCabe what we found, he promised to adjust his claim in the future. He said his main point was that Wisconsin\u2019s goal should be to have high-speed internet access everywhere.\nOur rating\nMcCabe claimed that Wisconsin ranks 49th in internet speed.\nA 2016 ranking put Wisconsin at 49th-slowest for broadband internet speed -- that is, for land-based internet, but that only provides a partial picture.\nWhen mobile is factored in, the state ranks much higher, in the neighborhood of 30th place.\nWe rate McCabe\u2019s claim Half True.
