What we need is more Jesus care. I believe if we can just get more of the people with pre-existing health conditions back into churches, you would see a lot of healing and many of these problems would go away. People who lead Godly lives don\u2019t worry about Doctors. We have The Lord to take care of us.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.
