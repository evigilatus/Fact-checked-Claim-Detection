My Journey to the White House.\"\n\nMetro Atlanta\u2019s would-be Republican presidential nominee wrote that we need to drill for oil offshore and in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and boost our nuclear energy capabilities.\n\n\"Let\u2019s face it, wind and solar energy development will not bring us to energy independence,\" the former Godfather\u2019s Pizza CEO wrote. \"Even the Department of Energy\u2019s \u2018Billion Ton Study\u2019 has shown that these two sources combined could at best provide only 5 percent of our total energy needs.\"\n\nDo solar and wind energy really have so little potential?\n\nWe contacted the Cain campaign, which did not respond, so we scoured the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s \"Billion Ton Study,\" a 2005 report whose official title is \"Biomass as Feedstock for a Bioenergy and Bioproducts Industry.\"\n\nAs you might suspect, it\u2019s about biomass, biological material such as plants or cow manure that can be used to produce energy. Like solar and wind energy, it\u2019s \"renewable,\" or comes from natural sources that are constantly replenished. \u00a0\n\nIt does not say what Cain said it did.\n\nIn fact, the \"Billion Ton Study\" mentions only solar and wind energy in passing. The crux of the report is to explore whether there\u2019s enough biomass in the U.S. to replace 30 percent or more of the nation\u2019s petroleum use. (Their answer is \"yes,\" assuming that certain policies and technologies are in place.)\n\nNow, just because Cain\u2019s claim isn\u2019t backed up by the \"Billion Ton Study\" doesn\u2019t mean his broader point about solar and wind is wrong. We dug further.\n\nWe found that under current government energy policies, the futures of solar and wind are limited, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which tracks energy statistics. Unless policies change, by 2035 wind and solar combined will account for 4 percent of U.S. consumption of electricity, or the stuff that runs our TVs or washing machines, their projections show.\n\nSolar and wind will account for 2 percent of total U.S. energy consumption in 2035. This includes electricity as well as other forms of energy, such as fuel that powers cars.\n\nBut these data do not describe what these technologies could do at their best, which was the main point of Cain\u2019s statement. To get a better sense of this, we interviewed energy experts and read federal studies and peer-reviewed research.\n\nThe scientific consensus is that there is more than enough sunshine and wind to supply the nation\u2019s total energy needs, experts told us, thanks to the wind-swept Great Plains and Texas and sun-baked states such as New Mexico.\n\n\"I don\u2019t think anybody can contend there isn\u2019t enough. There\u2019s more than enough,\" said Noam Lior, who has studied solar and other alternative energy technologies and their potential at the University of Pennsylvania. \u00a0\n\nBut could it actually happen? Could solar and wind actually provide, say, 10 percent of the nation\u2019s total needs?\n\n\"It\u2019s not just possible,\" said Daniel Matisoff, who studies environmental policy at Georgia Tech. \"It\u2019s likely.\" \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nFor instance, a 2008 Energy Department report said it\u2019s possible for wind energy to provide 20 percent of the nation\u2019s electricity supply by 2030, with significant upgrades in the nation\u2019s energy grid, policy changes that support the growth of the wind industry, and some wind turbine technology improvements. \u00a0\n\nElectricity, however, makes up only a portion of the nation\u2019s total energy use. The country needs fuel to power its cars and trucks as well. Getting consumers to switch to plug-in electric cars might be tough because of their limited range, said Marilyn A. Brown, a Georgia Tech professor who studies energy policy.\n\nThere are other big hurdles as well. The wind doesn\u2019t always blow, and sun doesn\u2019t always shine, so the U.S. would need to engineer systems that would keep a steady flow of electricity to homes and businesses.\n\nElectricity produced by fossil fuels is often less expensive than wind or solar. And lots of the nation\u2019s wind and solar resources are in remote areas. The country needs to install expensive transmission lines to transport it.\n\nAll in all, Cain has it wrong on solar and wind energy. The federal government\u2019s \"Billion Ton Study\" did not say that wind and solar energy combined \"could at best provide only 5 percent of our total energy needs.\"\n\nScientists think solar and wind alone can top 5 percent of the nation\u2019s total needs with policy and infrastructure changes. They could even power the entire nation if the U.S. commits to an energy overhaul, though it would take a lot of resources, time, political will, and possibly some new technologies to get this done.\n\nCain earns a False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden canceled the Keystone pipeline because Warren Buffett \u201cdonated $58 million\u201d to his campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 29, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-12252"}
