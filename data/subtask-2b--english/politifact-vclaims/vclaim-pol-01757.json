Greg Abbott presented a meme showing celebrated British statesman Winston Churchill saying: \"The fascists of the future will call themselves anti-fascists.\"\nIn his 1:10 a.m. Aug. 7, 2018 tweet, Abbott prefaced his citation of Churchill, who twice served as England\u2019s prime minister: \"Some insights are timeless.\" Why Abbott posted the quotation might be explained by the\u00a0headline on the meme above the purported Churchill quotation; it says: \"Churchill on the left wing.\"\nLater the same morning, multiple others--including Wes Wilson of Austin\u2019s KXAN TV news staff--responded on Twitter by asserting that Churchill didn\u2019t make the\u00a0statement shared by Abbott.\nAlso, within 10 hours of the Abbott tweet's appearance, it was no longer posted. Abbott then told reporters, Patrick Svitek of the Texas Tribune reported, that it was irrelevant to him\u00a0\"who may or may not have said that in the past. I didn\u2019t want to be accused of plagiarism for saying it. If no one else said it, attribute the quote to me because it\u2019s what I believe in.\"\nLike other news organizations, meantime, we'd already started to\u00a0check the accuracy of\u00a0the quotation.\nText down the left side of the Abbott-shared meme mentioned the\u00a09gag.com site, which TechCrunch, a technology news website, described in 2017 as \"a Hong Kong-based site that hosts and distributes funny pictures, videos and memes.\"\nWe visited the site and\u00a0spotted the same Churchill meme under the headline: \"A reference to G20 Thought you might enjoy this quote.\" We didn\u2019t spot a posting date on the meme. But reader comments below it start from July 10, 2017.\nOur phone and email inquiries about Abbott\u2019s claim didn\u2019t draw elaboration from Abbott\u2019s campaign spokesman.\nExperts spot no evidence Churchill made statement\nSeparately by email, the chief curator of the National Churchill Museum in Fulton, Missouri, Timothy Riley, told us that there\u2019s no evidence to suggest Churchill made the quoted statement in over 15 million words that he wrote encompassing his speeches, articles, books and other writings.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Whether he uttered the words in conversation is unknowable, but I am not aware of any of Churchill\u2019s contemporaries who record or recall the statement,\" Riley wrote.\nSeparately, the research director of a Hillsdale College project that has been publishing Churchill\u2019s papers responded to us by advising that its internal archive folding in Churchill\u2019s writings, speeches and official biography show no sign of Churchill making the Abbott-quoted statement.\nSoren Geiger said: \"I feel confident in saying that Churchill never said the statement.\"\nGenerally, Geiger said, \"if anything sounds witty or edgy, people can quickly believe that Churchill said it.\"\nWe asked Geiger if Churchill made other comments about future fascists. By email, Geiger also provided a copy of Churchill\u2019s July 27, 1943, speech about World War II and Italy to the House of Commons. In it, Churchill said: \"The keystone of the Fascist arch has crumbled, and, without attempting to prophesy, it does not seem unlikely that the entire Fascist edifice will fall to the ground in ruins, if it has not already so fallen. The totalitarian system of a single party, armed with secret police, engrossing to itself practically all the offices, even the humblest, under the Government, with magistrates and courts under the control of the executive, with its whole network of domestic spies and neighbourly informants \u2013 that system when applied over a long period of time, leaves the broad masses without any influence upon their country\u2019s destinies and without any independent figures apart from the official classes.\"\nOur ruling\nAbbott said that Churchill said, \"The fascists of the future will call themselves anti-fascists.\"\nAbbott\u00a0drew the quotation from a gag website,it appears,\u00a0and neither he nor the site made available\u00a0factual backup. Experts on Churchill\u2019s writings and speeches say there\u2019s no evidence Churchill made the statement.\nWe rate Abbott's since-deleted\u00a0claim False.\n\nFALSE \u2013 The statement is not accurate.
