His hardcover was written when the national health care policy supported by President Barack Obama included a public insurance option. So Romney's Massachusetts plan, by comparison, kept \"private insurance and personal choice intact,\" he wrote.\n\nThen the Democratic plan passed without the public option, and it very closely resembled Romney's plan. Both left in place the major insurance systems: employer-provided insurance, Medicare for seniors and Medicaid for the poor. They both aimed to reduce the number of uninsured by expanding Medicaid and offering tax breaks to help moderate income people buy insurance. And both included a requirement to buy insurance or else face a penalty, a provision called the individual mandate.\n\nSuddenly, the line in the hardcover edition to \"accomplish the same thing for everyone in the country\" as Republican Romney had done for Massachusetts was uncomfortably close to what the Democratic president had done nationally. Hence the change to the more declarative, \"it was done without government taking over health care.\"\n\nSo Perry was right that the words in Romney's book and even the meaning changed somewhat between editions. But he mischaracterized Romney\u2019s words. When PoliltiFact looked at the section of the hardback from which the quote came, we found that Romney was not really saying \"it was exactly what the American people needed, to have that Romneycare given to them.\" He was in fact presenting a defense of state-level choice \u2014 not a pitch for a mandatory national approach. \u00a0We rated Perry's comment Mostly False.\n\nNow Santorum has said, \"It was in your book that it should be for everybody,\" and added that Romney took the assertion out in a later edition. That\u2019s an exaggeration. We rate his statement Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-12246"}
