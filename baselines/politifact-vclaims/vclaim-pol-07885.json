He\u2019s also a freelance fact checker for the Times and has previously written about Wisconsin politics for the paper.\n\"The $1.5 billion mine would initially be close to four miles long, up to a half-mile wide and nearly 1,000 feet deep, but it could be extended as long as 21 miles,\" Kaufman wrote in the piece published March 29, 2014.\nThat\u2019s about the distance from Milwaukee\u2019s Bradford Beach to, say, downtown Waukesha.\nWe\u2019ve considered a couple of previous statements that addressed the size of the mine.\nWe rated True a claim by state Rep. Evan Goyke, D-Milwaukee, who said the mine would be larger than his Assembly district, which is among the smallest in the state. State Rep. Penny Bernard Schaber, D-Appleton, said the mine would be two-thirds the size of Lake Winnebago. We rated that Mostly False.\nSo what about Kaufman\u2019s claim that the mine could be 21 miles long?\nKaufman said the estimate was based on news reports, and documents that the company filed with the state of Wisconsin. Those records show Gogebic has an option to purchase the iron found in the deposit, which is 21 miles long, threading through the the Penokee mountain range.\n\"You'll notice our phrase says \u2018but it could be extended as long as 21 miles,\u2019\" Kaufman said in an email. \"We don't say it will be for sure. The company has many potential phases outlined of this project.\"\nHere\u2019s how the Department of Natural Resources describes the proposed mine on its website: \"Gogebic is currently considering potential development along a four-mile stretch east of Mellen in west-central Ashland County.\"\nSo, what accounts for the difference?\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Godlewski\n\n\nstated on January 9, 2021 in Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t all women that lost jobs (in the December jobs report), it was mostly Black and Latina women. In fact, white women gained employment.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Nusaiba Mizan \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDigging in\nThe permit process for the mine is in the early stages, said Larry Lynch, a hydrogeologist with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. He is the agency\u2019s top administrator overseeing the project. The first stage would actually be two pits, each two miles long. That\u2019s different from a single giant trench suggested in Kaufman\u2019s claim.\nKaufman describes a mine that if fully developed could be 21 miles long, a half mile wide and 1,000 feet deep. There\u2019s no question this would be an immense project, if it happens. But the mine would never look like that. Lynch said the first phase involves the excavation of a pit, which would, in turn, be filled in by the next pit.\n(Separately, we rated Mostly True a Kaufman claim that the company would be allowed to fill in \"pristine streams and ponds with mine waste.\")\nIn any case, the mine\u2019s first phase would operate for a projected 35 years.\nThe mine faces strong opposition from the neighboring Bad River band of the Chippewa. And the permitting process would be repeated if the company wanted to mine any additional part of the deposit.\nThat would depend upon what happens with the first phase, and comes with a host of unknowns.\nGeologists believe the deposit extends 21 miles, but Lynch said \"we do not have any information that says it will be economical\" for the company to mine all of the iron in the deposit. The iron in the latter phases might been too difficult to extract, in part because the iron is laced throughout the mountains in that region of the state.\nIn any case, no one is suggesting the mine -- even if it was fully developed decades from now -- would be a single, 21-mile-long pit.\nOur rating\nKaufman says the mine \"could be extended as long as 21 miles.\" That\u2019s the size of the deposit that Gogebic Taconite has the rights to mine.\nBut the initial phase envisioned in the permitting process is a four-mile stretch. Any additional mining would require another permitting process and would be decades away. And that\u2019s only if the company decides it\u2019s worth the effort.\nYourdictionary.com says: \"The definition of \u2018could\u2019 is often used in the place of \u2018can\u2019 to show a little doubt.\"\nBut there\u2019s more than a little doubt here. Kaufman\u2019s statement may be partially true, but it leaves out important information and details. That\u2019s our definition of Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07885"}
