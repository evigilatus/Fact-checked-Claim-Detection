Statewide, the agency in 2015 announced the 2014 state graduation rate was 88.3 percent, a record high.\nTexas High School Graduation Rates, Selected Districts, 2014\n\n\n\n\nDISTRICT\n\n\n2014 GRADUATION RATE USING FEDERAL STUDENT EXCLUSIONS\n\n\n2014 GRADUATION RATE USING STATE STUDENT EXCLUSIONS\n\n\n\n\nAustin\n\n\n86.3 percent\n\n\n88.6 percent\n\n\n\n\nDallas\n\n\n86.1\n\n\n86.9\n\n\n\n\nFort Worth\n\n\n81.0\n\n\n84.1\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHouston\n\n\n78.6\n\n\n81.8\n\n\n\n\nSan Antonio\n\n\n78.2\n\n\n80.8\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nSOURCES: Online searches using website, \"Search Four-Year Graduation and Dropout Data by District, Class of 2014,\" Texas Education Agency (accessed June 6-7, 2016)\nOther slices of data\nWe recognized other ways to compare the Austin district to other districts in major Texas cities.\nFor instance, TEA classifies Austin and 10 other districts as \"major urban\" districts, meaning each one is located in a county with a population of at least 870,000; its enrollment is the largest in the county or at least 75 percent of the largest district enrollment in the county; and at least 35 percent of enrolled students are economically disadvantaged.\nThe \"major urban\" districts include the districts AISD singled out for its ad plus the Arlington district in Tarrant County, the North East and Northside districts in San Antonio and several districts in El Paso County--El Paso, Socorro and Ysleta. And among these additional districts, per the state, the North East and Northside districts had the highest 2014 graduation rates (93.4 or 94.1 percent depending on the calculation). More than half the North East district lies within San Antonio, the district says, though it takes in smaller cities including Castle Hills. Northside describes itself as located in the northwest quadrant of San Antonio. The Socorro district, with 88.2 to 89.8 percent graduation rates, similarly fared better than the Austin district. The Socorro district says its serves students in East El Paso, the city of Socorro and Horizon City.\nYou could also look at districts based on enrollment, an approach that arguably elevates a suburban Houston district, the 110,000-student Cypress-Fairbanks district, into consideration. Its graduation rates of 91.4 and 92.4 percent, respectively, outpaced the 80,000-student Austin district\u2019s rates.\nWe ran these alternate comparisons past Telles, who said it\u2019s always a challenge to convert educational \"speak\" and/or data into something digestible for the general public. \"We\u2019re dealing with marketers that tell us billboard advertising is kind of complicated when you go more than six words,\" Telles said.\nTelles said the district could have compared Austin with its fellow \"major urban\" districts. Then again, he said, \"if you say Northside, the average person, I\u2019d venture to say, would not know where that is.\" The ad statement, he said, came down to \"consumability.\"\nIn a follow-up email, Telles noted that more than half the Austin district\u2019s student population is considered at risk of dropping out \u2014 which is also the case in the four districts it chose for the comparison. But that wasn't so, Telles wrote, for the Northside, North East or Socorro districts. In 2014, according to TEA data, 56 percent of Austin students were considered \"at risk.\" Half of Socorro students were at risk, the agency says, as were 43 percent of Northside students and 36 percent of North East students.\nOur ruling\nThe Austin district says it has the \"highest graduation rate of every major city in Texas.\"\nThis declaration is rooted in the faulty premise that Texas has only five major cities and only the districts named for those cities are worthy of comparison. Applying those filters gives the statement an element of truth.\nOn the other hand, we identified other districts in the same cities with higher graduation rates than the Austin district.\nWe\u2019re flipping the Truth-O-Meter\u2019s tassel and rating this claim Mostly False.\n\nMOSTLY FALSE \u2013 The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.
