But with more Oregonians living in poverty now than before the bottom dropped out, politicians around the state are debating how best to create new jobs.\nTalk of jobs was on everyone\u2019s mind at the 10th annual Oregon Leadership Summit Dec. 9 at the Oregon Convention Center. The Oregon Business Plan -- a collaborative effort involving business leaders, business associations and the state\u2019s elected leaders -- commissioned a paper called \"Path to Prosperity,\" which was released at the daylong session\u2019s opening.\nThe paper, written by ECONorthwest, an economic consulting and planning firm, focused on four strategies aimed at reducing poverty. One, touching on the need to bolster manufacturing, included this statement: \"Oregon leads the nation in number of jobs per capita in manufacturing.\"\nIt\u2019s an impressive claim but seemed at odds with a 2012 finding by PolitiFact Wisconsin, which awarded that same honor to the Badger State. In hopes of heading off any inter-state squabbling, PolitiFact Oregon decided to check.\nWe called Josh Lehner, a senior economist with the Oregon Office of Economic Analysis. \"I saw that, too,\" he said. \"Let me check some numbers and I\u2019ll call you back.\"\nLehner\u2019s own calculation took Oregon\u2019s annual Census Bureau population estimates and divided them by the number of manufacturing jobs in Oregon, as represented by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Things did not compute.\n\"Our manufacturing jobs per capita actually rank 22nd nationally,\u2019\u2019 Lehner said. He said he respects work done by ECONorthwest, but added, \"As for us being number one in that category, the math just doesn\u2019t add up.\" (Asked about Wisconsin, he said his figures show that state does, in fact, lead the country in manufacturing jobs per capita.)\nWe called John Tapogna, president of ECONorthwest and co-author of the paper, to ask about the apparent discrepancy. He immediately cleared up any confusion.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Boysko\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in a committee debate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe United States is the only industrialized, modernized country that does not already have a paid family medical leave program in place.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You caught a flaw in our report,\" he said. \"In the same way newspapers have to run corrections sometimes, we need to run one with this.\"\nTwo words, Tapogna added, turned the claim from true to false.\n\"We said Oregon leads the nation in the number of jobs per capita in manufacturing,\" he said. \"What we should have said is that Oregon leads the nation in manufacturing output per capita. It was just a mistake. There\u2019s no other way to say it.\"\nLehner verified that Oregon does indeed lead in manufacturing output per capita. Tapogna went on to provide information with which many Oregonians may be unaware.\nIt all started, he said, with Gordon Moore, Intel\u2019s co-founder, who predicted in 1965 that semiconductor industry innovations would enable twice as many transistors to be crammed onto an integrated circuit every two years or so.\nKnown as \"Moore\u2019s Law,\" the prediction has proved true. In the real world, it\u2019s continued to dramatically increase the value of the output, thus allowing Oregon to rank first nationally in manufacturing output per capita.\nDavid Autor, an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, added a cautionary note in an email. \"Not all manufacturing jobs are great jobs, and certainly not all great jobs are manufacturing jobs. But if Wisconsin or Oregon have manufacturing industries in which they have the skills, expertise and productivity needed to compete on the national and international market, that\u2019s a valuable thing -- something many states would surely like to emulate.\"\nThe Oregon Business Plan, in aiming to reduce the state\u2019s poverty rate from the current 17.2 percent to 10 percent by 2020, makes job creation a centerpiece of pursuing that goal. Public- and private-sector leaders, at last week\u2019s Oregon Leadership Summit, said building on existing strengths such as manufacturing will be critical to long-term success.\nECONorthwest, in preparing a paper delineating that success, wrote that \"Oregon leads the nation in number of jobs per capita in manufacturing.\" The sentence needed to be rewritten to say the state leads the nation in manufacturing output per capita. That would have made the claim true. But regardless of the correction that followed, PolitiFact Oregon makes its rulings based on original claims. Not to detract from the success Oregon is having in semiconductor manufacturing, but we rate the original claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08505"}
