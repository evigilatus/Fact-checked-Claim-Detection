Chris Collins said many Americans are already benefiting from the tax law Republicans in Congress passed in December.\nCollins used the claim to attack House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi in a tweet.\n\"Because of #TaxReform, 4 million American workers have received raises and bonuses, and 90% of Americans are seeing bigger paychecks this month,\" Collins tweeted. \"Despite what @NancyPelosi may say, this isn\u2019t \"crumbs\" for hardworking families in #WNY.\"\nPelosi had previously called the tax benefits for middle- and low-income earners \"crumbs\"\u00a0compared to what wealthy earners would receive.\nRepublicans who support the tax plan disagree. They believe the tax bill provides significant relief for those workers.\nCollins, a Republican from suburban Buffalo,\u00a0says those benefits have already started. Is he right?\n\u20184 million American workers\u2019\nPresident Donald Trump claimed 3 million workers in the U.S. had already received a pay increase or bonus thanks to the tax bill at the end of January. PolitiFact rated that claim Mostly True.\nPolitiFact checked Trump\u2019s claim using data from Americans for Tax Reform, a group that advocates for lower taxes. The group supported the Republican tax bill.\nThe group has a running list of companies that have announced bonuses or other benefits based on press releases and media reports since the tax law passed. At the end of January, at least 286 companies had announced benefits for more than 3 million workers.\nThat number has since grown to more than 4 million workers from 408 companies, according to the group. Those workers have gotten a bonus, pay increase, 401(k) hike, or utility rate cut because of the new tax law, according to reports.\nThat\u2019s not a small number of workers, but it accounts for less than 3 percent of the total employed population in the U.S.\nExperts also told PolitiFact that some of the bonuses may have already been planned before the tax law to retain workers in a tight labor market.\nLarger paychecks\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColin Schmitt\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a news conference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have scientific data, from all different levels, but particularly from the high school sports levels, from numerous different states that shows that it is safe to play what New York is considering high-risk sports.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jill Terreri Ramos \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second part of Collins\u2019 claim is based on a prediction from the U.S. Department of the Treasury.\nThe agency said in January that 90 percent of working Americans would have less federal tax withheld from their paychecks by the middle of February. Employers had until Feb. 15 to implement the lower federal tax rates.\n\"We\u2019re estimating that 90 percent of workers are going to see an increase in take-home pay because of the Tax Cuts [and Jobs] Act,\" U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said.\nWe reached out to the agency to see if its prediction panned out for February. We did not hear back.\nThe actual share of workers with more take-home pay may be lower than 90 percent, according to Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.\n\"It is true that roughly 90 percent of Americans will get a tax cut this year as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,\" Gleckman said.\nBut many Americans will not see higher take-home pay because of other factors, like higher health insurance premiums.\nHigher\u00a0premiums could exceed any increase in take-home pay. Premiums for individual and employer-sponsored health plans are expected to rise again this year. An argument could be made that without the new tax rates, employees would have less money to pay for the higher premiums.\nMore benefits from the law will be available during next year\u2019s tax filing period. That\u2019s when other provisions begin, like a higher standard deduction for filers.\nOur ruling\nCollins said \"Because of #TaxReform, 4 million American workers have received raises and bonuses, and 90% of Americans are seeing bigger paychecks this month.\"\nThe first part of Collins\u2019 claim is correct based on a compilation of companies from a tax cut advocacy group. PolitiFact used the same list when fact-checking Trump on a similar claim.\nThe second part of Collins\u2019 claim is less clear. The Treasury Department predicted 90 percent of workers would have lower federal taxes in February. We don\u2019t know how many had higher take-home pay, Gleckman said.\nThe statement is accurate but needed additional information.
