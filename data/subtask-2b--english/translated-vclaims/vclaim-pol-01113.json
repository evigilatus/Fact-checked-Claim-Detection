Dahli. \"When I was president of the CPS, we turned the record deficit into a surplus and built new schools in the neighborhood,\" says Chico at the site. \"As head of city colleges, I have reduced millions of waste and reduced property taxes.\" We recently verified the fact that it is a fact that is often an allegation by another mayor's competitor, Paul Vallas, who reflects what Chico says about his years as president of the Chicago Board of Education. Vallas was an executive director of the city schools at the same time that Chico presided over the school board, so any financial transformation demanded by one can be claimed by the other. But Chico's pride in city colleges also caught our attention. The reduction of spending on millions and the reduction of property taxes seemed long, especially given that the state of Chico in the city colleges began in 2010 and lasted less than seven months. He resigned to run for mayor in the 2011 city elections, which he lost to retired Ram Emmanuel now. The Board &apos; s documentation from the days of Chico appears to support his claim that property and expenditure taxes have been reduced under his supervision. However, these same documents also show that the savings that passed on to individual taxpayers from his property tax cuts were diminishing and began to move before Chico took the lead in city colleges. First, let us address the question of the amount of budget cuts that Chico has provided. \"Smooth\" is a subjective term, so we contacted the Chico campaign to ask him what he meant by saying he cut out \"millions\" of it. The woman speaking (Kelly Queen) said that the University Council under the leadership of Chico had abolished several hundred non-educational jobs, destroyed dozens of unoccupied jobs and curbed travel expenses. She referred to news stories from that time describing the pressure exerted by the Board under Dali to reinvent the system and streamline its services. A financial review by city colleges of the only approved budget under the Chico programme found that staff costs had decreased by $4.4 million, while a further $1.7 million had been reduced under travel, supplies and utilities. Tax reduction - but not much in both this and other advertising, Chico is likely to cast himself as a candidate to give taxpayers a chance. City colleges have reduced their property tax under Chico. However, Chico's supervision of the breaks was so modest that the suspected homeowners in Chicago noticed them on tax bills. According to the Tax Act 2017, \"persons earning less than $75,000 will raise their taxes in 2021 and every two years thereafter until 2027.\" By Louis Jacobson on February 5, 2021, the context is important in tax analysis. The share of city colleges in the total property tax burden in Chicago is small. It was a little over 3% of the tax burden when Chico ran the college board, the tax records in Cook County show up. The cuts that he now boasts are just part of 3+%. In other words, tax cuts under Chico flew about $3 in tax bills 2010 and 2011 for the owner of the Chicago house $200,000, according to the county tax records. (In the mysterious Cook County Tax World, the 2009 tax was used to calculate the 2010 invoices and the 2010 tax was translated into the 2011 invoices. At the same time, the province was reducing its property tax charges and was travelling on foot for student education fees, as shown in the city college budget document. In the analysis of Chico's budget, the Civil Federation, a Chicago-based government financial observer, noted that the increase in tuition fees still leaves city colleges \"a very competitive price.\" However, this also means that the system relies more on students to earn revenue while giving small time to property owners. It should also be noted that the city college budget document shows that the lion &apos; s share of the reductions in property tax carried out under Chico was already ordered by the Board in July 2009 - nine months before joining it. \"As head of city colleges, I reduced millions in waste and reduced property taxes,\" said the Governor Chico. He only had a cup of coffee in city colleges, to borrow a phrase of baseball for a player who served only for a short period in the main league. Expenditure under Chico has been reduced, as well as taxes. But the savings for a modest homeowner in Chicago are barely enough to buy a real cup of coffee. In addition, records show that a large part of the tax cuts he gets started before he arrived at city colleges. Chico's statement is accurate in his face, but it ignores the main details and context. We value it half right. The truth is now - the statement is partially accurate, but it ignores important details or leaves things out of context.
