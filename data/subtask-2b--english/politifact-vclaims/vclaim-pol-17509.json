(Penuma is a kind of penile implant.) It also claims the actor, who has starred in movies like \"The Six Million Dollar Man\" and \"Scrooged,\" left $6 million for President Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign in his will.\nThe story was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

It has been shared more than 6,000 times.\n\n(Screenshot from AJUAnews.com)\nAJUAnews is a hoax news site that has a track record of republishing false, satirical stories without their original context.

It\u2019s run by Christopher Blair, a liberal who tries to trick conservatives into sharing made-up stories on social media. A lot of AJUAnews\u2019 content appears to come from Blair\u2019s network of sites.\nThe story on Conservative Tears has several satire labels \u2014 including a \"Death Hoax\" tag \u2014 while AJUAnews\u2019 version does not. Facebook users and pages have also shared the latter with the assumption that it\u2019s real.\nMajors\u00a0has been cast in an upcoming movie called \"Narco Sub,\" which is in pre-production for release in 2020. No news outlets have reported that he\u2019s dead.\nThe article is inaccurate and makes a ridiculous claim. We rate it Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17509"}
