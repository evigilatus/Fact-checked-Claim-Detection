Andrew Cuomo\u2019s complaints about a provision in the 2017 federal tax law have\u00a0intensified in recent months. The provision caps the federal deduction for state and local tax payments at $10,000.\n\"As governor of the state of New York today, my top priority is repealing SALT. Period,\" Cuomo told reporters in March, referring to the cap on state and local tax deductions in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nThe effect of the $10,000 cap on SALT deductions is widespread in New York, Cuomo said. \u00a0\n\"Fifty-two counties have average taxes of above the SALT $10,000 cap,\" Cuomo said at his March news conference. \"Fifty-two counties will see a tax increase.\"\nWe wondered if his rhetoric around the issue is accurate. Is the problem with the cap as widespread as he said? Do 52 counties have average state and local taxes\u00a0above the $10,000 cap?\nBackground\nCuomo has repeated this claim several times, and a report from the Office of the State Comptroller appears to be his source. In October 2017, while changes to the tax law were under discussion but before they were passed, Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli released a report on how the changes could affect New York. One of the proposals DiNapoli\u2019s office analyzed was the proposal in Washington to eliminate or reduce the federal deduction for state and local taxes.\n\"This is a big deal for our state: New Yorkers reported more than $72 billion in deductions for income and property taxes in 2015,\" DiNapoli wrote.\nOf that total, income taxes accounted for $51.7 billion and property taxes for $20.9 billion. \u00a0\nThe Office of Comptroller found that filers who claimed state and local tax deductions had an average deduction of more than $10,000 in 52 of New York\u2019s 62 counties, according to its analysis of county-by-county data from the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s Statistics of Income program from the 2015 tax year.\nThe most recent IRS data, released from the 2016 tax year, showed average deductions above $10,000 in 53 counties.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColin Schmitt\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a news conference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have scientific data, from all different levels, but particularly from the high school sports levels, from numerous different states that shows that it is safe to play what New York is considering high-risk sports.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jill Terreri Ramos \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe asked some tax experts about Cuomo\u2019s claim. Several noted that many tax filers do not itemize their deductions, and that Cuomo\u2019s claim about \"average taxes above the cap\" fails to convey this point.\n\"Only 34.8 percent of New Yorkers took the state and local tax deduction in 2016; the governor is claiming that average taxes in these counties are over $10,000 based on the taxes of a little over one-third of the population -- generally speaking, the wealthiest one-third,\" said Jared Walczak, a senior policy analyst at the nonpartisan Tax Foundation. Walczak found that the average state and local taxes across all filers was above $10,000 in only three counties: Westchester, New York and Nassau. Even if it\u2019s not relevant for SALT deduction purposes, filers who don\u2019t itemize have state and local tax liabilities, too, so the average would be over $10,000 in a handful of other counties, such as Putnam, Rockland and Suffolk counties, Walczak said.\nTax experts also noted that averages can be skewed by a few very high earners.\n\"To put this in context: 81.5 percent of New York filers have an adjusted gross income of $100,000 or less, and they pay an average of $2,840 in federal income taxes. Yet the average federal income tax liability for a New York filer is $13,896, skewed upward by the highest earners,\" Walczak said. \"Similarly, the vast majority of New York filers are well below the SALT deduction cap, and in many cases aren't deducting state and local taxes at all.\" \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIf Cuomo\u2019s implication is that taxes will go up because of the cap on SALT, \"of course, most of those people still get a tax cut because of TCJA,\" said Steve Wamhoff, director of federal tax policy at the left-leaning Institute of Taxation and Economic Policy.\nWe asked the governor\u2019s office about the issues with his claim that 52 counties have average state and local taxes\u00a0above $10,000.\n\"The facts remain the same: The federal government values the cap on SALT deductions at more than $600 billion over the next decade; and New Yorkers will pay $15 billion more to the federal government annually, taking more from New York than any other State,\" said Freeman Klopott, spokesman for the Division of Budget. \"The bottom line is this is a tax increase for our state to benefit the federal government that unfairly attacks New York, which is already the top contributor to the federal government.\"\nPolitiFact New York has fact-checked a claim that New York gives more to the federal treasury than the state gets back, and found it to be True.\nOur ruling\nIn making a case to repeal the $10,000 cap on state and local tax deductions, Cuomo said that in 52 counties the average amount of state and local taxes exceeded the cap.\nThe latest data available, from 2016, before the new tax law was implemented, show that in 53 counties, the average state and local tax deduction was greater than $10,000, when the average is calculated using returns from filers who claimed that deduction -- not from every filer. He bases his statement on the taxes paid by about one-third of the population,\u00a0generally the more affluent\u00a0one-third.\nCuomo's statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression about how severe the cap is for most New Yorkers. He makes it seem the cap's effect is\u00a0more widespread than it is.\nWe rate his claim Mostly False.\n Share the Facts 2019-04-17 14:36:49 UTC   PolitiFact    3 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly False  \"Fifty-two counties have average taxes of above the SALT $10,000 cap.\"    Andrew Cuomo Governor of New York https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/audio-rush-transcript-governor-cuomo-outlines-remaining-budget-priorities-0   in a news conference Monday, March 11, 2019 2019-03-11    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00748"}
