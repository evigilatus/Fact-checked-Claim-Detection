Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill. -- a leader in the effort to pass comprehensive immigration reform -- says the United States is spending plenty of money on border enforcement.\n\"We spend $18 billion a year on making sure that the federal government has immigrant enforcement agents,\" Gutierrez said. \"That's more than DEA\u00a0(the Drug Enforcement Administration) and the ATF (the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives) and the FBI and all the other enforcements combined. But we still have a problem, right? So you can keep throwing money and talk about enforcement, enforcement, enforcement, but you've got to put money also into your judicial system, and you've got to put money in a comprehensive program that deals with the issue.\"\nGutierrez made his comments on the July 13, 2014, edition of CBS\u2019 Face the Nation discussing the surge of unaccompanied minors at the United States-Mexico border.\nWe were surprised to hear him claim that the government spends more money on border and immigration enforcement than it does on all other federal law-enforcement agencies, including the FBI. So we took a closer look.\nWhen we asked Gutierrez\u2019s office for a source, they pointed to a January 2013 report by the Migration Policy Institute tiled, \"Immigration Enforcement in the United States: The Rise of a Formidable Machinery.\"\nThe report found that spending in three federal-budget line items -- Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Protection, and US-VISIT, an automated tracking system for visitors to the United States -- totaled nearly $18 billion in fiscal year 2012. That was more than the $14.4 billion spent by other law-enforcement agencies that year. Those agencies were the FBI, the DEA, the ATF, the Secret Service and the U.S. Marshals Service.\nSo, according to this report, spending on immigration enforcement did outpace other forms of federal law-enforcement in 2012.\nBut that\u2019s two-year-old data, so we decided to do an update. Here\u2019s the rundown of enacted federal spending levels for fiscal year 2014. Some of these agencies are part of the Justice Department and some are part of the Department of Homeland Security. On the suggestion of experts, we\u2019re using each agency\u2019s appropriated budget -- that is, the part of their budget paid by taxpayers. This method ignores user fees paid by companies and others directly to the government for services.

Adding in Citizenship and Immigration Services to the immigration side boosts the immigration total to $16.3 billion, while adding TSA to the non-immigration side would make the new total $20.6 billion.\nAdding the Coast Guard into the equation would likely make Gutierrez\u2019s claim even more wrong, though allocating the Coast Guard\u2019s budget between immigration and non-immigration duties is tricky. By law, the Coast Guard\u2019s mission includes such areas as port, waterway, and coastal security; drug interdiction; migrant interdiction; and \"other law enforcement.\" So a portion would likely end up on both the immigration and non-immigration sides of the equation.\nWhen we showed our calculations to Gutierrez\u2019s office, Douglas Rivlin, the spokesman, said, \"We were going from the report, which as far as we knew at the time was the best, most authoritative and most recent analysis available to us.\"\nOur ruling\nGutierrez said, \"We spend $18 billion a year on making sure that the federal government has immigrant enforcement agents. That's more than D.E.A. and the A.T.F. and the F.B.I. and all the other enforcement (agencies) combined.\"\nHe\u2019s correct under an agency classification system developed by the Migration Policy Institute. However, the institute\u2019s calculations exclude the TSA and the Coast Guard. According to the group, these are not criminal-law enforcement agencies, but that seems like a fairly arbitrary distinction to us, and, more importantly, since Gutierrez didn\u2019t make that distinction, we don\u2019t see a good reason to exclude them. Adding in TSA by itself would make Gutierrez wrong. Because different approaches produce different results, we rate the claim Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07603"}
