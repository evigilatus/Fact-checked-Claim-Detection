When Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., asked whether political donations are a reason to disqualify someone from working on the investigation, Rosenstein answered, \"No, senator, it is not a disqualification. It is not.\"\nAccording to Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis, Congress has a longstanding concern about the possibility of partisanship in the federal workplace, leading it to place restrictions on partisan political activity through the Hatch Act. While the Hatch Act prohibits employees from campaigning for or against a subject of the investigation, financial contributions are permitted.\n\"The Hatch Act places federal employees under two different categories, and some employees are subject to tighter restrictions on their partisan political activities,\" Clark said. That includes those working on Justice Department criminal investigations. \"But even those folks \u2026 are permitted to make political contributions.\"\n\"If someone has some kind of bias against someone or an association with or against, that\u2019s not fair, and there\u2019s a specific federal ethics regulation that requires federal officials who are participating in a proceeding like a criminal investigation to be able to be impartial and have the appearance of impartiality,\" she added. \"Even staffers who have represented Clinton don\u2019t fall into that category.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow, we\u2019ve compiled a list of the special counsel staffers, their financial contributions and employment histories.\nAaron Zebley, Mueller\u2019s former FBI chief of staff, previously served as a senior counselor in the National Security Division, as an special agent in the FBI\u2019s counterterrorism division, and as assistant U.S. attorney in Alexandria, Va. Following his various stints at the FBI, Zebley worked at WilmerHale, the same law firm as Mueller. There, he once represented Clinton aide Justin Cooper. FEC filings showed that Zebley did not contribute to any political campaigns.\nJames Quarles, a former Watergate assistant special prosecutor, also worked at WilmerHale. He did not represent Clinton or any of her aides. He did, however, contribute $2,700 to Hillary for America, Clinton\u2019s PAC, on Oct. 7, 2016. He also contributed $15,550 to Democratic congressional candidates since 2002; $2,000 to Democratic presidential candidates since 1999; $2,000 to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee; and $1,000 to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in 2009. He is the only staffer who also contributed to a Republican congressional candidate. He gave $2,500 to U.S. Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, in 2015.\nMichael Dreeben was the deputy solicitor general for the Justice Department, focusing on criminal matters before the Supreme Court and federal appellate courts. While a Michael W. Dreeben shows up in FEC files as having donated $1,000 to Hillary for America on June 27, 2006, this is a different Dreeben in Chicago. The deputy solicitor general has made no campaign contributions.\nAndrew Weissmann, the chief of the Justice Department\u2019s criminal division fraud section, has also worked as the FBI general counsel, deputy and then director of the Enron task force, and an assistant U.S. attorney in New York. While he made no contributions to Clinton\u2019s PAC, he gave a total of $2,350 to the Obama Victory fund in 2008.\nJeannie Rhee was a deputy assistant attorney general in the Office of Legal Counsel and an assistant U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, prosecuting fraud and public corruption cases. She represented the Clinton Foundation for WilmerHale before a conservative legal activist who brought forth a racketeering lawsuit in June 2015. She also contributed a total of $5,400 to Clinton\u2019s PAC in 2015 and 2016.\nLisa Page served in the FBI\u2019s general counsel office and as a trial attorney in the Justice Department\u2019s criminal division\u2019s organized crime and gang section. She made no campaign contributions.\nElizabeth Prelogar is a former Fulbright scholar in Russia who served as an appellate attorney on detail for the Office of the Solicitor General and as an attorney at Hogan Lovells. She contributed $250 to Hillary for America in 2016 and $250 to the Obama Victory Fund in 2012.\nAdam Jed, an appellate attorney on detail from the Justice Department\u2019s civil division, made no campaign contributions.\nOur ruling\nTrump said that members of Mueller\u2019s team are \"all Hillary Clinton supporters, some of them worked for Hillary Clinton.\"\nThree of the eight available Mueller hires made campaign contributions to Clinton, which undermines Trump\u2019s statement that all are Clinton supporters. Furthermore, none of them have worked for Clinton directly. Two represented either the Clinton Foundation or an aide, never her, and working for WilmerHale, which has also represented key members of Trump\u2019s White House. The Justice Department has looked into the contributions and employment histories of all of their hires and determined them consistent with the rules of professional responsibility. Trump\u2019s implication is that the investigation is politically motivated, but we see nothing to support that.\nWe rate this statement Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03172"}
