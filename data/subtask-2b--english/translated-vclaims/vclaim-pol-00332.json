She is also right that the automobile and airline industries are facing a major shortage of mechanics. On January 13, 2021, General David H. Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request to use marines for security, saying, \"We are not working for you.\" By Samantha Buterman: January 17, 2021, the Bureau of Labour Statistics estimates that there will be 34,000 unoccupied car mechanics and 4,000 airline technicians each year until the end of 2014. However, it is overpaid by graduates of vocational schools who can expect to earn it in these occupations. A car mechanic who earns $50,000 to $60,000 will be in 90% of the income for that occupation, according to government data. The average salary for an automobile technician is $32,450; for airline mechanics it is $45,290.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00332"}
