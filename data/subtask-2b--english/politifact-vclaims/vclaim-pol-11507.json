In his speech, Obama laid out a defense of his oil-related policies and reiterated his commitment to diverse energy sources.\n\nOne of his speech\u2019s shortest lines caught our attention: \"We supported the first new nuclear power plant in three decades.\"\n\nThirty years -- really? And why has it been so long? To satisfy our curiosity, we decided to check it out. (We fact-checked Obama\u2019s claims about drilling in a separate report.)\n\nIf you haven\u2019t been keeping tabs on the nuclear energy industry, it has indeed been awhile since a new reactor was built. But Obama\u2019s 30-year claim hinges on licensing.\n\nOn Feb. 9, 2012, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved a license for two new nuclear reactors in Georgia. The electricity giant Southern Co. intends to build them at its Vogtle site south of Augusta. (The White House pointed us to news coverage of the approval when we asked for evidence of Obama\u2019s statement.)\n\nPrior to this year, the last time the commission granted a license to build a new reactor was in 1978, which was 34 years ago, according to a commission spokesperson. The permit was for the Shearon Harris plant operated by Carolina Power & Light near Raleigh, N.C. But it takes a long time to build nuclear reactors, so the plant didn\u2019t get operational approval until 1986.\n\nAnd the North Carolina plant isn\u2019t the most recent to go operational. That distinction goes to the Tennessee Valley Authority\u2019s Watts Bar site in Tennessee. It received a construction license in 1973 and an operating license in 1996, or 16 years ago.\n\nStill, as we ran this claim by people who watch the nuclear industry closely -- both those opposed to nuclear energy and those in favor of it -- they agreed Obama\u2019s claim to have \"supported the first new nuclear power plant in three decades\" was largely accurate.\n\nA technical note: The Georgia project adds two reactors to an existing electricity generation site with two existing reactors. We wondered if that diminished the accuracy of Obama\u2019s statement, but the experts said it\u2019s fair to call each reactor its own \"power plant.\"\n\nNuclear\u2019s long wait\n\nSo why has it been so long since a license was granted?\n\nInterestingly, the experts we spoke with said it\u2019s not because of bureaucratic hassles or super-stringent rules. Rather, it\u2019s because building new plants is expensive, and the dynamics of the energy market haven\u2019t made new reactors a good deal for energy producers.\n\nThe Nuclear Information and Resource Service opposes nuclear energy as \"dangerous, dirty and expensive,\" said executive director Michael Mariotte. It\u2019s the expensive part that\u2019s made for the long wait, he said.\n\nEnergy companies have struggled to build plants in a cost-efficient manner, and the Georgia plants are a long way from being finished, he said. The Southern Co. is trying to construct two reactors at once, which makes for more operational complexity.\n\n\"If history repeats itself, then they won\u2019t get built. We\u2019ll have to see how much the industry has learned in the past three decades in terms of managing construction costs,\" he said.\n\nHis group is part of a lawsuit to stop the construction, on the grounds that the reactor designs need to be updated with lessons learned from the recent nuclear disaster near Fukushima, Japan. (The Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved the license on a 4-1 vote; the dissenting vote was cast for that reason.)\n\nA sunnier take on the three-decade wait is that the nuclear industry has been really good at innovating and getting more electricity out of its existing plants. That\u2019s what Steve Kerekes of the pro-nuclear Nuclear Energy Institute told us.\n\n\"From essentially a static number of facilities -- a little over 100 --we\u2019ve increased our electricity output roughly 40 percent. That\u2019s the equivalent of nearly 30 new reactors since 1990, and we\u2019ve done that from existing facilities,\" he said.\n\nNuclear executives say they would build more plants if the current energy markets were different. The Georgia plant is going forward in a state where regulations allow utilities to bill customers for construction costs before the plant is finished.\n\nBy way of contrast, the Illinois-based nuclear energy company Exelon operates in many states where that\u2019s not the case. Exelon executives have said plainly it makes little economic sense for them to build new plants, citing two more factors.\u00a0First, natural gas prices are very low. Second, Congress has abandoned plans to address global warming through a cap-and-trade system or other attempts to limit carbon emissions from coal-fired electricity generation. Both those things work against the business case for building new reactors. (Exelon executives, by the way, donated to Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign, as we noted in this fact-check.)\n\nThe administration\u2019s support\n\nObama said in his speech that his administration \"supported\" the new nuclear plants. Again, experts agreed this was so, particularly since the administration is in final negotiations to support the Southern Co.\u2019s construction with $8.33 billion in federal loan guarantees.\n\nBack in February 2010, when the project received conditional approval, Obama himself praised the deal, connecting it to the need for climate change legislation.\n\n\"To meet our growing energy needs and prevent the worst consequences of climate change, we need to increase our supply of nuclear power, and today\u2019s announcement helps to move us down that path,\" he said.\n\nOur ruling\n\nObama said, \"We supported the first new nuclear power plant in three decades.\" He is right that it\u2019s been that long since a new nuclear reactor has been licensed. However, because it takes so long to construct nuclear power plants, the most recent plant actually opened in 1996.\n\nThe experts we spoke with, both those who support nuclear power and those who oppose it, said that Obama\u2019s statement was largely accurate, given that the last time a nuclear reactor received federal approval was 1978. And, his administration has so far supported the recent approval of new reactors in Georgia with $8.3 billion in federal loan guarantees.\n\nWe rate Obama\u2019s statement Mostly True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden canceled the Keystone pipeline because Warren Buffett \u201cdonated $58 million\u201d to his campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 29, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11507"}
