The remark came in the context of Gingrich\u2019s suggestion that poor students should be given the opportunity to fill duties currently handled by school janitors, calling it a way to instill a work eithic while also saving money.\n\n\"As to schools, I think every person up here worked at a young age,\" Gingrich said. \"What I suggested was kids ought to be able to work part time in school, particularly in the poorest neighborhoods, both because they could use the money. If you take one half of the New York janitors who unionized and paid more than the teachers -- an entry level janitor gets paid twice as much as an entry level teacher. You take half those janitors you could give -- you give lots of poor kids a work experience in the cafeteria, in the school library, in the front office and a lot of different things.\"\n\nWe received a flurry of requests from readers that we fact-check the claim that in New York City, \"an entry level janitor gets paid twice as much as an entry level teacher.\"\n\nWe suspect that Gingrich\u2019s claim originated with an April 18, 2011, report by the local NBC News affiliate titled, \"School Custodians Earn More Than Bronx Teachers.\" Here\u2019s an excerpt:\n\n\"Teachers in at least one Bronx school earn less money than the building custodian, a stat that has surprised students and parents.\n\n\"Although it is commonly assumed teachers' wages top the salaries of custodians, an NBC New York analysis of public payrolls shows many custodians make more money than even the highest paid city teachers.\n\n\"According to the union contract governing New York City Custodian Engineers, the men and women responsible for keeping school buildings clean and operating can make up to $114,000 a year in base pay. The highest paid teacher, with a masters degree and decades of tenure, can hope to make just over $100,000 in base pay. \u2026\n\n\"The pay-scale differences are even more pronounced for rookie teachers and custodians. First-year New York City school teachers without graduate degrees, make about $45,000 a year. The minimum pay for a first-year custodial engineer is almost $80,000 a year.\"\n\nThe NBC story was correct about the starting salary for teachers in the New York City Department of Education, at least those with only a bachelor\u2019s degree and no prior teaching experience. Such teachers start at $45,530. Teachers\u00a0who have a master\u2019s degree but no teaching experience start at $51,425.\n\nBut what about the people Gingrich called \"janitors\"? This is where he runs into trouble.\n\nThe NBC piece referred to a \"first-year custodial engineer.\" That\u2019s a much more senior position, requiring specific skills and experience. Here\u2019s how the official exam describes \"what the job involves\" at \"assignment level 1,\" the lower of two levels:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Under general supervision (custodial engineers) supervise and are responsible for the physical operation, maintenance, repair, custodial upkeep and care of a public school building and its immediate grounds; supervise,\u00a0plan and are responsible for the work of the custodial and maintenance staff; heat building by means of low pressure boilers; maintain HVAC equipment; make minor repairs to steam plant, heating equipment, electrical equipment, plumbing, structure, glazing and furniture; supervise cleaning of the building and grounds; maintain the building and grounds in a safe, secure and sanitary condition; conduct inspections of building to determine needed repairs; consult with and advise officials on problems of operation, maintenance and repairs; set up custodial work schedules to ensure maximum efficiency and minimum interference with classroom activities; requisition and account for custodial and maintenance materials, tools and supplies; maintain records and prepare required reports of plant operations; within assigned budget, hire appropriate personnel and train or arrange for their training, prepare payrolls and personnel forms, pay wages and provide Worker\u2019s Compensation Insurance for hired personnel; are responsible for interior maintenance painting of school building; perform related work.\"\n\nSomehow, we don\u2019t think a middle-schooler or high-schooler is qualified to \"make minor repairs to steam plant, heating equipment, electrical equipment, plumbing, structure,\" or \"requisition and account for custodial and maintenance materials, tools and supplies,\" or \"hire appropriate personnel and train or arrange for their training, prepare payrolls and personnel forms, pay wages and provide Worker\u2019s Compensation Insurance.\"\n\nCustodial engineers are actually supervisory positions. In fact, you can\u2019t even apply for this job unless you have a\u00a0\"four-year high school diploma or its educational equivalent and one year of full-time paid satisfactory experience in operating boilers.\"\n\nFor all these responsibilities, what do you get paid? In 2004, when the exam announcement we found was released, the rate was $41,500. Today, it\u2019s $55,625, according to Robert J. Troeller, president and business manager of Local 891 of the International Union of Operating Engineers in Brooklyn, N.Y.\n\nThe latter amount is higher than teachers with either a bachelor\u2019s degree or a master\u2019s agree -- but it\u2019s not double, as Gingrich said. And more importantly, we don\u2019t think a starting custodial engineer would be what Gingrich calls an \"entry level janitor.\"\n\nWe asked Troeller for the beginning wages for lower-level custodial positions in schools according to collective bargaining agreements. In descending order of skills required, they are:\n\nEngineer (responsible for boilers that require special training): $23.38 per hour, equivalent to $48,630 for a full year.\n\nFireman (runs the boilers): $20.68 per hour, or $43,014 for a full year.\n\nHandyman: $17.68 per hour, or $36,774 for a full year.\n\nCleaner: $15.77 per hour, or $32,801 for a full year.\u00a0(First- and second-year employees\u00a0are paid below the standard\u00a0rate; in year three, it\u00a0goes up to the standard rate of $18.13 an hour.)\n\nWe agree with Troeller that \"cleaner\" best fits the description\u00a0of \"entry level janitor\" as used by Gingrich. And for that,\u00a0even the least credentialed starting teacher earns about 1.4 times as much as a starting cleaner, and a starting teacher with a graduate degree earns 1.6 times as much. (We\u2019re assuming here that new cleaners work a 40-hour week and a 52-week year, which is not necessarily the case, Troeller said.)\n\nOur ruling\n\nGingrich could have argued that the contracts for unionized New York City custodial engineers max out at a higher level than that for teachers; that much is true. Instead, he twisted the statistic beyond recognition.\n\nStarting custodial engineers do earn more than starting teachers, but not \"twice\" the amount. Meanwhile, a custodial engineer is a credentialed supervisory position, not an \"entry level janitor.\" When you compare apples to apples -- an entry-level unionized \"cleaner\" to an entry-level unionized teacher -- the teacher earns 1.4 to 1.6 times more.
