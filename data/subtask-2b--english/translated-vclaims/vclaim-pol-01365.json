The purpose of mergers is to encourage schools to share resources and provide funds. The State has some of the highest costs per pupil in the country, and prior to this reform the lowest ratio of school members to students. The process was controversial, and the debate on mergers extended to the Governors &apos; race. The candidate of Democratic Governor Christine Halquist accused the Government of the Republic Phil Scott is stubborn in his efforts to contain educational spending in his first term. This subject was raised earlier this month, and the Scott administration has been accused of rejecting all alternative proposals to the provinces that have refused integration. \"44 plans affecting 90 school districts have been submitted. And Scott's administration rejected them all. She said at a press conference on October 10 in Berlin. A copy of that allegation was repeated later that day in a discussion with Scott in Rutland. And that makes us wonder -- did Scott really say no to every county requesting a postponement under the Consolidation Act? We contacted the Halquist campaign, which referred to a report by Vermonters to schools and communities, in which it was claimed that \"communities seeking approval of an alternative administrative structure have the right to assess their efforts in good faith in good faith. Instead, they were all rejected.\" As required by law, the Minister of Education submitted a recommended plan to the State Council of Non-integrated Provinces. This is the plan that was attacked in Vermonters for schools and the community report cited by the Halquist campaign. However, Scott &apos; s administration has no authority to refuse or approve alternative structures. The Vermont State Board of Education has the last word on provinces that have not been voluntarily integrated. Furthermore, in many cases, the Secretary of the Scott Education Agency agreed with the provinces that had submitted alternative proposals in the area of governance that they should maintain their current structures. Take Hartland and Weathersfield, for example, at Upper Valley. The neighbouring areas of K-8 have asked the state to allow them to remain in one town, autonomous areas. In the plan proposed by the Agency, then Interim Minister Heather Bush wrote that while integration between the two regions was legally possible, it was not very logical to strengthen those areas since each town had little in common and its children were taught in different secondary schools. \"Because there does not seem to be any commitment on the part of societies to create a new definition of 'we', there is little chance that they will realize the potential opportunities for a larger and more flexible unified structure,\" Bushi wrote. In almost half of the cases, the Secretary recommended that the Council of State should do exactly what the provinces had requested in their proposals. The fact-finding articles mentioned on January 11, 2021 in Facebook by Nancy Belusi, Speaker of the House of Representatives, are no longer by Samantha Buterman. According to the Halquist campaign, Margaret McLean, an educational adviser and activist in Vermonters for schools and communities, was the main person in Law 46. Here, how did McLean explain, earlier this summer, why the group claimed that all AGS proposals had been rejected: \"The Secretary recommended forced integration or no action. I recommended approval of zero, \"I wrote in an e-mail to VTDiger. The general argument of McLean is that a fair assessment of AGS proposals by the State would have included a title to examine whether the provinces had shown that they were able to achieve the objectives of the law - such as cost-efficiency and equity - without consolidation, and then make recommendations accordingly. While the group was free to argue with how the Secretary had decided to make its recommendations, it was not fair to say that the Agency had \"rejection\" of all alternative proposals. In 21 cases, the Secretary agreed with the provinces that had submitted alternative governance proposals requesting that their administrative structures remain the same. Christine Halquist, the governor, accused Jove. Phil Scott rejected all alternative sentencing proposals under Law 46. However, that statement was based on a misleading discourse from anti-integration advocates. In 21 cases, the Minister of Education agreed with the provinces that had submitted alternative proposals that they could maintain their existing structure and did not recommend forced mergers to the Council of State. We're assessing this claim as false. Following the publication of this fact-finding statement, Christine Halquist sent a press release retracting her statement, thanking VTDiger Lola Dufort for the article and celebrating the role of the press in the political discourse. \"I appreciate when the press both hold me and Governor Scott responsible when we make mistakes, as it should. That makes us better and serve the public in Vermont,\" she said. \"Governor Scott and his administration have been severely handed over to public schools, but it is quite true that, as I said, not every 46th Act rejected the alternative provision proposal. I apologize and retract this allegation. In this, as in all policy matters, I am open to new information and new evidence that would better serve any proposals I have made.\"", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01365"}
