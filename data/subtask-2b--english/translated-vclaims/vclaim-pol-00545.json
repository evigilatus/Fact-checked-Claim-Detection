Although decades have passed, it has suddenly become a point of contention in the 2020 presidential campaign, where Joe Biden's rivals criticized her history of voting. The Hyde Amendment was named for his original hero, the late Republic of Henry Hyde, R-LL. It has been passed by Congress regularly since 1977. It states that the Federal Government cannot afford to pay for abortion, but has always included an exception to the life of the mother, and has often included exceptions to rape and incest as well. Oppositions to abortion rights have made maintaining the Hyde Amendment a long-term priority. Now, those who prefer abortion rights give priority to abolishing them. The criticism of June 2019 led Paden to change his attitude. On June 6, Biden announced that he was now opposed to this policy - like the rest of the democratic presidential sphere. A key presidential opponent, Mr. Bernie Sanders, from I-Vt, went to Twitter to put forward his position against the Hyde Amendment. \"If we believe that women have the constitutional right to control their bodies, this right must apply to all women, including low-income women. That's why I always voted against Hyde's amendment and why, as President, I would remove it.\" While we believe that women have the constitutional right to control their own bodies, this right must apply to all women, including low-income women. For this reason, I have consistently voted against Hyde's amendment, and why, as President, I would like to remove it. A reader (@BernieSanders) wrote to us on June 6, 2019 to suggest that we check Sanders' assertion that \"I have consistently voted against Hyde's amendment.\" When we looked at the story, we found that the story was more complicated than Sanders pointed out. What does voting against Hyde's amendment mean? Hyde's amendment is usually included in the annual bills funded by the Ministry of Health and Human Services. As a result, Biden (who held the post of Democratic Senator from Delaware between 1973 and 2009) and other members of Congress faced legislation containing the amendment on several occasions. The main factor hidden by Sanders' tweeting is that Hyde's amendment is usually not voted as a stand-alone draft law. It is often included in large credit bills. In some cases, a negative vote on these large spending bills risks closing the government. In general, Sanders has already voted in favour of abortion rights on the Hyde Amendment Bills and Amendments. However, it has often voted in favour of final spending measures that include Hyde. \"Big bills always contain a lot of things that may not be loved by a particular legislator, but they are usually unwilling to sink the entire bill to prevent the enactment of one rule,\" said Josh Ryan, a politician at Utah State University who studies Congressional proceedings. On January 13, 2021, bloggers announced the extraordinary truth-checking story in which General David H. Berger, commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request for marine security, and told her that we were \"not working for you.\" By Samantha Butterman, on January 17, 2021, a good example can be seen in two voices that Sanders made in 1993, when he served at home. In one case that year, the Council voted 255-178 to keep the Hyde Amendment specifically in the relevant expenditure bill. Saunders voted no, at a time when a large number of Democrats - 98 - were joining most Republicans in voting to keep the amendment in books. Nevertheless, Sanders voted on behalf of the final version of the expenditure bill. The measure has crossed a margin of 305-124, supported by 237 Democrats. The Sanders campaign cited several occasions when, together with abortion rights, it voted on a specific draft law to amend the Hyde Act - in the example mentioned above in 1993, as well as additional measures in 1997, 2001, 2009 and 2019. When we reviewed the votes of the 1999 appropriations, we found several occasions when Sanders endorsed the final version of the spending bill that financed the Ministry of Health and Human Services, all of which included the drafting of the Hyde Amendment. As a member of the Senate, Sanders voted on these bills for fiscal years 2016, 2014, 2013, 2010, 2008, 2007 and 2006, when all senators unanimously passed the bill. As a member of the Chamber of Deputies, it voted in favour of these bills for fiscal years 2005, 2002, 2001 and 1999. The political scientist at the University of Miami Gregory Cougar, another congressman, says. \"For a democracy that supports social welfare but is also pro-choice, I think they made peace with a Hyde version and tried only to resist abuse.\" The difference in Sanders' vote drew the attention of the host of CNN Dana Bash. When I met Sanders on CNN on June 9, I asked Sanders, \"You said this week that you've always voted against Hyde's amendment. But in fact, in the past you voted to support the huge spending bills that include Hyde's amendment. Is it misleading, Senator, to say you've never voted for her before? \"In a big bill, you have to vote for things you don't like. But I think my record as 100% literally pro-choice is quite correct. See, if you believe, as I do, that a woman's right to control her body is a constitutional right, then it must apply to all women, including low-income women. That's what I always believed, and that's what I believe now.\" The Saunders Poletti Fuckett campaign reported that the Senator had consistently obtained strong votes from abortion rights groups. These grades are usually a factor in votes taken on specific measures to amend Hyde, but not in broader Hyde-language spending bills. Sanders often received an estimate of 100 per cent of both NARAL Pro-Choice America and zero from the National Commission on the Right to Life. \"I have consistently voted against Hyde's amendment.\" Sanders &apos; comments refer to a clean slate on this issue that cannot be voted on by senators who wish to vote in favour of major spending bills for government funding. He has the point that when Hyde's amendment came as a stand-alone measure, he voted with the pro-abortion rights side. Anyway, Sanders left out that he voted many times for extensive spending bills that include a copy of Hyde's modification. The statement is partially accurate but leaves important details, so we evaluate it half right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00545"}
