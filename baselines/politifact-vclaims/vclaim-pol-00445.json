Searching for \"Fourth of July\" and \"Trump,\" we found the following headlines on or before July 5 (among others):\n\u2022\"Trump announces Fourth of July \u2018Salute to America\u2019 at the Lincoln Memorial,\" by Feb. 24, 2019\n\u2022\"Trump says tanks will be on display in Washington for July 4,\" July 1, 2019\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\"Tanks already in Washington for Trump\u2019s Fourth of July event,\" July 2, 2019\u00a0\n\u2022\"Washington prepares for July 4 spectacle, starring and produced by President Trump,\" July 3, 2019\n\u2022\"With flyovers and flags, Trump plays M.C. for the Fourth,\" July 4, 2019\n\u2022\"Two Americas, celebrating separately in one place,\" July 4, 2019\n\u2022\"Trump sets off fireworks of a different sort with Fourth of July speech plan,\" July 5, 2019\nThat\u2019s among other media coverage from outlets like CNN, Reuters, Bloomberg, The Guardian and The Washington Post.\u00a0\nOn July 10, Vulture reported on the 6.4 million people who watched the festivities on TV. Most of those were tuned into Fox News, which had 4.9 million viewers during the hour, according to Nielsen ratings. CNN mixed coverage of Trump\u2019s speech with analysis and drew 1.5 million viewers, according to Vulture.\nIt notes that NBC had a \"politics-free presentation of the Macy\u2019s Fourth of July fireworks/concert,\" before airing a condensed version of the special at 10 p.m. MSNBC, meanwhile, aired \"encores of the first Democratic-primary presidential debates.\"\u00a0\nBefore the big event, some publications advised readers on how they could watch the celebration. Newsweek reported that CBS News, C-SPAN and Fox News would carry it live and streaming elsewhere online. Deadline reported that PBS was also planning to air it live while \"the broadcast networks will rely mostly on their streaming channels for Trump\u2019s portion of the event.\"\nStill, there was plenty of other coverage of the event.\u00a0\nWe rate this Facebook post False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00445"}
