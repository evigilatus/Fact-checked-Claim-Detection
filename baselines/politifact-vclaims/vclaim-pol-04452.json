Bruce Rauner and his associates as Illinois House Speaker Mike Madigan claims?\nMadigan, who has served as speaker for all but two years since 1983, was challenged in the 2016 Democratic primary election for the 22nd District by Jason Gonzales, an entrepreneur and high school dropout who went on to receive degrees from Duke, MIT and Harvard. Despite labeling himself as a progressive, Gonzales had the backing of Republicans and supporters of Gov. Bruce Rauner.\nNearly six months after being defeated in the primary by more than 38 percentage points, Gonzales filed a lawsuit on Aug. 8 accusing Madigan -- who also is chairman of the Illinois Democratic Party -- of dozens of illegal and fraudulent acts during the election season.\n\nThe 39-count suit accuses Madigan and others of defaming Gonzales by calling him a convicted felon in campaign ads and committing fraud by putting up two \"fake\" candidates on the ballot to \"dilute\" the Latino vote, among other allegations.\nIn response to the lawsuit, Madigan issued a statement calling Gonzales\u2019 claims without merit, but one sentence in particular stood out: \"Gonzales\u2019 losing campaign against me last spring was funded with more than $1 million from supporters and allies of Governor Bruce Rauner.\"\nWhile it\u2019s no secret Gonzales was backed by Republicans and supporters of Rauner -- Madigan\u2019s biggest political foe -- is it true his campaign was funded with more than $1 million from them?\nFollowing the money\nMadigan spokesman Steve Brown told PolitiFact Illinois the $1 million figure came from the Illinois State Board of Elections.\nCampaign finance records from the State Board of Elections show Gonzales received $278,771 in individual contributions during the primary race.\nWe found some of the top contributors to Gonzales\u2019 campaign fund also have donated to Rauner and some top contributors to Gonzales also have donated to other Democrats. \u00a0\nIn a phone interview, Gonzales acknowledged he received financial support from the governor\u2019s supporters, but said there never was a quid pro quo between him and Rauner or his allies.\nGonzales pointed out many of his donors have contributed to both parties.\nAnd not all of his top contributors have donated to Rauner.\nRobert Hirsch, CEO of Gold Eagle, a company that manufactures automotive chemicals, donated $27,500 to Gonzales -- the largest individual contribution to the campaign -- but there is no record of Hirsch contributing to Rauner\u2019s political committees. However, Hirsch did support redistricting reform efforts backed by Rauner and opposed by Madigan in 2014 and 2016, though that is an issue that has bipartisan support.\n\"I had to dial for money every day, and a lot of donors I dialed on Democratic lists happened to be supporters of Bruce Rauner and there was nothing I could do about that,\" Gonzales said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 27, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden canceled the Keystone pipeline because Warren Buffett \u201cdonated $58 million\u201d to his campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 29, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong Gonzales\u2019 top donors was Blair Hull, a wealthy Chicago businessman who unsuccessfully ran in the 2004 Democratic primary race for U.S. Senate, which eventually was won by then-state Sen. Barack Obama.\nRecords show Hull donated $7,250 to Gonzales\u2019 campaign on March 3. He also contributed $5,000 to Rauner during the 2014 gubernatorial race.\nBut Hull\u2019s company, Hull Investments LLC, donated $450,000 to the Illinois United for Change super PAC, which spent $506,000 in support of Gonzales and $367,000 against Madigan.\nCalls to Hull Investments LLC were not returned, but Hull told the Capitol Fax blog in February that Madigan\u00a0\"is not a team player\" and \"does not cooperate well with others.\" Hull added that he believed \"the state of Illinois and the Legislature would be improved significantly without Michael Madigan.\"\nIf you combine the total amount spent in the race by Illinois United for Change and individual contributions to Gonzales\u2019 campaign fund, it comes out to about $1.15 million.\nWhile Brown noted spending by the super PAC was included in Madigan\u2019s claim, it\u2019s illegal for an independent expenditure committee to contribute directly to a candidate\u2019s campaign.\nKent Redfield, an Illinois campaign finance expert and professor emeritus of political science at the University of Illinois-Springfield, said Madigan\u2019s statement is a \"reasonable assumption,\" but there\u2019s no evidence to suggest the super PAC coordinated with Rauner\u2019s office, his political committees or supporters.\n\"The statement makes it sound like it was a coordinated campaign that involved different entities,\" Redfield said. \"While it may be the case, you don\u2019t have anything on public record.\"\nRedfield characterized Madigan\u2019s claim as an \"overstatement.\" He added that while it \"assumes a connection that very well may be there,\" there\u2019s no definitive link.\nHowever, the issue of dark money makes it extremely difficult to determine where exactly the money is coming from, notes Sarah Brune, executive director of the Illinois Campaign for Political Reform.\nFor example, Illinois United for Change received $20,000 in donations from the Illinois Opportunity Project, a 501(c)4 organization that is highly critical of Madigan and supportive of Rauner. The group is led by Dan Proft, Matthew Besler and Pat Hughes, all of whom are Republicans.\nNon-profit 501(c)4 groups can spend unlimited amounts of money on politics without disclosing their donors, making it impossible to identify direct ties to certain politicians or their supporters.\nOur ruling\nMadigan said, \"Gonzales\u2019 losing campaign against me last spring was funded with more than $1 million from supporters and allies of Governor Bruce Rauner.\"\nIndeed, Gonzales\u2019 campaign received big donations from people who also gave to Rauner\u2019s campaign fund, but the speaker implies that every donation came from individuals and groups aligned with the governor. In fact, a few of Gonzales\u2019 top donors have also contributed to Democrats and one of his top five donors contributed to Gonzales and no one else.\nFurther, Madigan\u2019s \"more than $1 million\" includes spending by the Illinois United for Change super PAC, despite the fact that super PAC money cannot be given directly to a candidate\u2019s campaign nor can it be coordinated with a candidate\u2019s campaign.\nWe rate Madigan\u2019s claim Mostly False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7a1d2957-50ad-4415-a9b1-895f7e25d265", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04452"}
