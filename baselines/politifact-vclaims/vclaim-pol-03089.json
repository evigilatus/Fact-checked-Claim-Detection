During the July 17, 2017 ceremony, Trump made some remarks, including a claim about his productivity.\nReferring to Vice President Mike Pence, who was standing behind him, Trump said:\nIn just a few months and moments, I will say what we\u2019ve done over a short period of time and what we\u2019re going to be doing over the next six months will be incredible. \u00a0We\u2019ve signed more bills -- and I\u2019m talking about through the legislature -- than any president ever. \u00a0For a while, Harry Truman had us, and now I think we have everybody, Mike. \u00a0I better say \"think,\" otherwise they\u2019ll give me a Pinocchio -- (laughter) -- and I don\u2019t like those -- I don\u2019t like Pinocchios. \u00a0\nThe data\nIn April 2017, at the 100-day mark of his presidency, Trump had signed 28 bills into law. That was\u00a0the most since the 55 signed into law by Democratic President Harry Truman in 1949, after Truman was elected to his first full term.\nBut, despite his claim on his 178th day in office, Trump is behind a number of presidents over the past several decades, according to GovTrack.us, a website that tracks Congress.\n\n\n\n\nPresident, party, year took office\n\n\nBills signed into law through 178 days in office\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDwight Eisenhower, R, 1953\n\n\n228\n\n\n\n\nJohn F.
