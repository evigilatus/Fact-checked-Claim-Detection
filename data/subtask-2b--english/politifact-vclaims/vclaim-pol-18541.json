(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0It has more than 176,000 views.\n\n(Screenshot from Facebook)\nWe reached out to his page for a comment, but we haven\u2019t heard back.\nDuring his video, Herrell cites a Nov. 14 report from the Buffalo Chronicle with the headline: \"How a Philly mob boss stole the election \u2014 and why he may flip on Joe Biden.\" The Buffalo Chronicle website is owned by businessman Matthew Ricchiazzi. It has published false claims about prospective members of the Biden administration, Canadian politics and New York\u2019s response to COVID-19.\nThis new Buffalo Chronicle article cites anonymous sources to say the Biden campaign paid $3 million to \"Skinny Joey\" Merlino, a reputed mafia veteran in Philadelphia, and Merlino\u2019s associates to fabricate 300,000 ballots in the battleground state. On Election Night, the site claims, Merlino and his team were creating 6,000 fraudulent ballots per hour.\n\"They were then packaged into non-descript cardboard boxes and dropped off outside the Philadelphia Convention Center,\" the article says. \"The ballots were purchased in cash.\"\nThe Buffalo Chronicle wrote that Merlino \"might just be willing to flip on Biden\" if Trump expunges his criminal record. Merlino would \"really like a job with the National Parks Service,\" according to the site\u2019s anonymous source.\nThere is no evidence the Biden campaign hired a mob boss to fabricate hundreds of thousands of ballots in Pennsylvania. The article plays into other baseless claims that widespread voter fraud in battleground states affected the outcome of the presidential race.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL. Lin Wood\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in an interview with the Patriotically Correct Radio Show\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"China was behind the interference and the effort to overthrow our government and the election, election fraud.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Daniel Funke \u2022 January 19, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Nov. 16, the Buffalo Chronicle story was shared on Twitter by attorney Jordan Sekulow, who \u2014\u00a0along with his father Jay Sekulow \u2014 is a member\u00a0of Trump\u2019s legal team. The Sekulows have helped the president mount legal challenges in battleground states over the election results.\n\"This is being reported by the Buffalo Chronicle,\" Herrell said in his video. \"And it is verified by Jordan Sekulow.\"\nJordan Sekulow shared the link and said \"follow all leads.\" Meanwhile, Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer who recently falsely claimed there were hundreds of thousands of \"unlawful votes\" in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, told Fox Business the allegation was \"far-fetched.\"\nWe reached out to the Buffalo Chronicle for a comment, but we haven\u2019t heard back.\nThere is no evidence of widespread voter fraud in Philadelphia \u2014 and certainly not hundreds of thousands of fabricated ballots favoring Biden.\n\"We just had the most transparent and secure election in the history of Philadelphia,\" said Philadelphia City Commissioner Al Schmidt, a Republican who sits on the city\u2019s elections board, in a Nov. 11 interview with CNN. \"I have seen the most fantastical things on social media, making completely ridiculous allegations that have no basis in fact at all.\"\nIn a Nov. 12 statement, a committee made up of U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency officials and its election partners said that, nationwide, this election was \"the most secure in American history.\"\nRELATED:\u00a0How we know Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential race\n\"There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised,\" the agency wrote. \"While we know there are many unfounded claims and opportunities for misinformation about the process of our elections, we can assure you we have the utmost confidence in the security and integrity of our elections, and you should too.\"\nAs for Merlino, the purported mob boss has been on supervised release in South Florida since 2018, when he took a plea deal in a racketeering and conspiracy case. During his most recent trial, Merlino said he had retired from the mob and was focused on running an upscale Italian restaurant in Boca Raton, Fla.\nMerlino\u2019s lawyer denied his client was part of any voter fraud scheme in Pennsylvania.\u00a0\n\"My client categorically denies all the allegations and Joey would rather die than ever be a snitch,\" John Meringolo told the New York Daily News.\nWe reached out to the Biden transition team for a comment, but we haven\u2019t heard back.\nThe Facebook post is inaccurate and makes a ridiculous claim.
