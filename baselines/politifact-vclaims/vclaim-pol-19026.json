That\u2019s not true.", "text": "A television ad from incumbent U.S. Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., attacks his Democratic challenger, state Rep. Jon Hoadley, for a vote he cast in June in Michigan\u2019s House.\n\"Hoadley voted against law enforcement, siding with defund the police, making families less safe,\" the narrator in the ad claims.\nThe ad features Berrien County Sheriff Paul Bailey, who claims that \"what Hoadley did to vote to defund the police was wrong.\"\nBut Hoadley didn\u2019t vote to defund the police.\nUpton\u2019s ad cites Hoadley\u2019s Jun. 17 vote against a resolution adopted by the Michigan House that discourages local governments in Michigan from defunding or abolishing their local police departments. Resolutions offer the Legislature a way to state its priorities, but they are nonbinding.\nThe resolution did not propose to increase or decrease funding for local police departments, whose budgets are determined at the local level.\nBailey stands by his claim that Hoadley voted to defund the police. \"It is concerning when Jon Hoadley \u2013 who sits on the Appropriations Committee \u2013 talks about how frustrating it is that \u2018everything but police got cut\u2019 or how important it is to discuss \u2018reprioritizing parts of our budget.\u2019 Then, just weeks later, he chooses to vote against a resolution that discourages local governments from defunding or abolishing their police departments,\" Bailey said in a statement to PolitiFact Michigan.\nBailey was referring to remarks Hoadley made during a June 12 event organized by Mothers of Hope, a community organization based in Kalamazoo, during which Hoadley was asked about his position on defunding the police. \"It is frustrating that everything but police got cut whenever there was a question \u2014 was the pile big enough? So I think it\u2019s important we\u2019re having this conversation now about reprioritizing parts of our budget,\" Hoadley said.\n\"It's clear to me and in the eyes of law enforcement \u2013 his vote was a vote to defund the police,\" Bailey added.\nJosh Paciorek, communications director for Upton\u2019s campaign, told PolitiFact Michigan in an email: \"We\u2019re taking law enforcement\u2019s view on this one.\"\nThe phrase \"defunding the police\" has come to refer to a range of policies, from redirecting some funding toward community development initiatives to dismantling police agencies altogether. It has served as a shorthand rallying cry for activists demanding police reforms, as well as a political cudgel for conservatives seeking to paint liberals as soft on crime.\nHoadley said he did not vote to defund the police. \"I voted against an inaccurate resolution that was attempting to score political points, not solve problems,\" he said in a statement to PolitiFact Michigan. \"Many of my colleagues spoke to the need to vote \u2018no\u2019 on the resolution and continue the real work on criminal justice reform, racial justice, and properly supporting public safety so both officers and residents are more secure.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Gateway Pundit\n\n\nstated on February 5, 2021 in an article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNewly discovered video shows late night deliveries of tens of thousands of illegal ballots 8 hours after deadline.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Clara Hendrickson \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMichigan House resolution discouraged budget cuts to local law enforcement, but did not boost funding.\nThe resolution Upton\u2019s ad refers to was introduced by Republican state Rep. Ryan Berman and passed with support of all 58 House Republicans and 21 House Democrats. Hoadley was among the 29 Democratic members of the House who voted against the resolution.\nBerman explained that he introduced the resolution as a kind of referendum on calls to defund or abolish police departments. \"The notion of outright defunding police departments is dangerous, and I\u2019ve tendered this resolution to take a stand against it,\" said Berman on the House floor.\nThe resolution did not propose increasing funding for local law enforcement departments.\nWhile Berman and Hoadley took different positions on the resolution, they agreed on one thing: The COVID-induced economic recession has created fiscal challenges for local governments that could affect police budgets.\n\"With potentially massive budget shortfalls facing us due to COVID-19, I imagine it will be even tougher for departments financially in the coming years,\" Berman said on the House floor.\nIn a statement explaining his vote, Hoadely agreed with Berman\u2019s assessment but argued that that the resolution\u2019s intent would strip local governments of the flexibility they need to respond to budget shortfalls.\n\"We cannot opine from the floor of the statehouse on what local communities should or (should) not spend their dollars on while not offering solutions,\" said Hoadley, adding: \"How do you tell your local firefighters that potentially half of you are going to have to get laid off but, that\u2019s OK because this resolution thought that police departments shouldn\u2019t be subject to the same budget realities as everyone else?\"\nPaciorek, from the Upton campaign, argued that Hoadley\u2019s acknowledgement of the fiscal constraints facing local governments \u2014 including police \u2014 was inconsistent with his vote. \"Why would he vote against a resolution that discourages local governments from stripping even more resources from police services?\" he asked.\nHoadley criticized the resolution as a way of shutting down debate around police reform, but he did not say that funding for police should be reduced.\nOur ruling\nA campaign ad from Upton says Hoadley voted to defund the police.\nIn June, Hoadley voted against a resolution discouraging local governments from reducing their police department\u2019s budgets or abolishing their department. He cited the need to continue discussion about criminal justice reform and to give local governments flexibility to make spending decisions.\nHe did not vote to reduce spending on law enforcement.\nWe rate this claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19026"}
