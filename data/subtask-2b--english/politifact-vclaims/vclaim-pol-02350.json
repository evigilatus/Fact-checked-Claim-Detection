We found no evidence that the famous movie star had died.\nThe fake story said that Douglas died of natural causes and that his family released a statement saying he \"went comfortably and was in no pain\" and \"lived a long and prosperous life that people only dream of.\"\nIn 2014, People magazine accidentally published the actor\u2019s obituary on its website.\n\"DO NOT PUB Kirk Douglas Dies\" the headline read. The magazine removed the obit from it's website after reports about the premature obit circulated on social media. Many news organizations pre-write obits of famous people.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe searched for mainstream news reports about Douglas and found no reports that he had died. When Douglas turned 101 in December, the Daily Gazette in Schenectady, N.Y., where the actor\u2019s sister lives quoted the actor\u2019s niece Marilyn Gordon.\n\"Uncle Kirk is doing great,\" Gordon said. \"They're going to have a big party for him (Saturday).\"\nDouglas survived a helicopter crash in 1991 and a stroke in 1996.\n\"I never, ever thought I would live to be 100. That\u2019s shocked me, really. And it\u2019s sad, too,\" he said in a 2017 interview.\nWe sent an email to Your Action News 3 and did not get a reply. Our fact-checking friends at Snopes have debunked other death hoaxes by the same website about Morgan Freeman, Bob Barker, and George Zimmerman.\nDouglas is still alive, despite a fake story that said he was dead. We rate this story Pants on Fire.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ebe1a7c5-84ef-4c89-b4d5-3f3392888f9a", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02350"}
