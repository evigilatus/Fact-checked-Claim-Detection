People who overstay their visas but don\u2019t pose a threat to national security, public safety or border security fall into ICE\u2019s second priority.\nThe conservative-leaning Washington Times reported that at least 480,000 people didn\u2019t leave the country as expected in fiscal year 2015. Immigration officials investigated just 10,000 of these cases and arrested fewer than 2,000 because, as the Times reported, \"the others don\u2019t rise to the level of being priority targets.\"\nThe article was based on a June 2016 House Homeland Security Committee hearing on overstays. Homeland Security Department officials testified that out of the nearly 10,000 leads pursued: about 4,100 cases were closed for being in compliance; at least 3,000 were under current investigation; 1,910 were arrested, and the rest were under \"continuous monitoring and further investigation as appropriate.\"\nICE data shows that out of a total 235,413 removals in fiscal year 2015, about 18,500 were second-priority removals. There\u2019s no breakdown of how many of those were visa overstays (that category also includes those convicted of drug-related crimes, unlawful possession or use of firearm and other misdemeanors).\nIndefinite number of overstays\nImmigration officials and scholars say not much is known about legal immigrants who overstay their visa, so they rely on estimates.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2006, Pew Research Center said visa overstays could make up at least 4 million\u00a0of the population here illegally, roughly one-third of that\u00a0population.\nThe first legal requirement for an entry-exit system came in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. It took about 20 years before DHS released its first ever Entry/Exit Overstay Report, though it only contained information for fiscal year 2015.\nAlmost 45 million people were expected to leave in fiscal year 2015, the report said, and about 98.8 percent did so on time.\nAbout 482,700 were still in the country by Sept. 30, 2015, the end of the 2015 fiscal year. That dropped to 416,500 by Jan. 4, 2016.\nOverstay consequences\nWhile DHS devotes less enforcement resources to visa overstays than it does to border enforcement, violators are still apprehended and removed, said Donald M. Kerwin, executive director of the Center for Migration Studies, a think tank studying international migration.\nUndocumented immigrants also are not eligible for most public benefits, said Robert Warren, an expert on immigration and senior visiting fellow at the center.\nPeople who overstay their visas and become undocumented may also face limitations when applying for jobs. The Immigration Reform and Control Act in 1986 forbids employers from knowingly hiring people who are not authorized to work in the United States.\nIf they leave and want to come back, they may be disqualified from getting a visa and not be let in, said Lazaro Zamora, a Bipartisan Policy Center senior policy analyst.\nUnder the Immigration and Nationality Act, unlawful presence for more than 180 days is punishable by a 3-year bar against re-entering, and unlawful presence of one year or more is punishable by a 10-year ban, Zamora said.\nOur ruling\nPence said, \"An enormous number of people come to this country legally and then simply overstay their visas because we make no effort to hold them accountable to that or uphold the law.\"\nPence\u2019s statement suggests there are no repercussions for people who overstay their visa. While they are not ICE\u2019s top concern \u2014 officials say they prioritize the removal of convicted criminals over visa violators\u2014 they can still be deported and barred from coming back into the United States.\nAbout 8 percent of the 235,413 people removed from the country in fiscal year 2015 belonged to\u00a0a category that\u00a0includes visa overstays.\u00a0\nWe rate Pence\u2019s statement Half True.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/dacd5379-eb5c-4ea5-8303-93cd7e56e241", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04341"}
