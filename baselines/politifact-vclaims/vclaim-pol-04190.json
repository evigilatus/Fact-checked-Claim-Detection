Tim Kaine, D-Va.\nAt the Oct. 4 vice presidential debate in Farmville, Va., Kaine argued Clinton is more equipped than Trump to deal with Russia.\n\"She went toe-to-toe with Russia as secretary of state to do the New START agreement to reduce Russia's nuclear stockpile,\" he said.\nNew START, the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, is an agreement between Russia and the United States designed to limit both countries\u2019 deployed strategic nuclear weapons. The original START treaty was in force from 1994 until it expired in 2009; New START was signed in April 2010 and went into effect in February 2011.\nClinton has similarly touted the New START agreement, saying it cuts Russia\u2019s nuclear arms. We rated her claim Half True because it overstated the treaty\u2019s impact.\nKaine\u2019s claim that the treaty was supposed \"to reduce Russia\u2019s nuclear stockpile\" falls into the same hole, just a bit deeper. The treaty, in fact, doesn\u2019t require Russia to cut its nuclear stockpile at all because it only limits deployed weapons.\n\"Russia is not expected to rapidly or dramatically reduce its nuclear weapons holdings,\"\u00a0said Lisa Koch, a professor and nuclear proliferation expert at Claremont McKenna College. \"New START could be characterized as a modest, rather than a sweeping, arms control treaty.\"\nWhat\u2019s in the treaty?\nAs secretary of state, Clinton was involved in New START's\u00a0negotiation and passage. Replacing the prior START treaty was a priority\u00a0of Clinton's in the beginning of\u00a0her tenure in 2009. She served as co-commissioner of the\u00a0U.S.-Russia Bilateral Presidential Commission\u00a0with Russian\u00a0Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov, and she personally met with Russian leaders\u00a0in Moscow to discuss New START during the negotiation phase. She also was involved in persuading senators to support the treaty.\u00a0\nNew START has three primary limitations on vehicles capable of launching nuclear weapons and the nuclear warheads themselves. By February 2018, Russia and the United States each have to meet these restrictions:\n\n\n700 deployed ballistic missiles and heavy bombers, which include intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and heavy bombers capable of carrying nuclear weapons;\n\n\n800 total deployed and non-deployed launchers, such as intercontinental ballistic missile launchers, submarine-launched ballistic missile launchers, and nuclear-capable heavy bombers;\n\n\n1,550 total deployed nuclear warheads on these missiles and bombers.\n\n\nIt\u2019s accurate that these limits are more restrictive than prior treaties. For example, START I limited deployed nuclear warheads to 6,000, and the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty limited them to 1,700-2,200.\nBut it\u2019s questionable whether it has, in practice, reduced Russia\u2019s nuclear arsenal for two main reasons:\nFirst, Russia was actually below New START limits in two out of the three categories right when treaty implementation began in February 2011.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe State Department publishes where both countries stand on these requirements twice a year, starting with an initial exchange of data when New START took force in February 2011.\nAt that time, Russia had 865 deployed and non-deployed launchers for strategic missiles and heavy bombers, meaning it would have to reduce that fleet by 65 to meet the limit of 800 by February 2018. However, Russia had 521 deployed missiles and heavy bombers out of 700 allowed, and 1,537 deployed nuclear warheads out of 1,550 allowed.\nSo Russia could actually increase its deployed missiles and heavy bombers, as well as its deployed nuclear warheads, beyond that initial February 2011 count and still be within treaty limits.\nBefore New START passed, it was clear Russia intended to modernize its nuclear arsenal in a big way, said Steven Pifer, director of the Brookings Arms Control and Non-Proliferation Initiative. Now, their modernization efforts have to fit within the New START limits, and it\u2019s unclear if they would have grown beyond those limits absent the treaty.\n\"I would say that New START does reduce and limit Russian strategic arms, but I would not overly hype the depth of the reduction,\" said Pifer, a Clinton supporter who testified before Congress in favor of New START.\nSecond, New START only limits a portion of the nuclear arsenals.\nNew START mainly counts strategic, deployed weapons. But it doesn\u2019t limit nonstrategic weapons, nor weapons that have been stockpiled or retired.\nThe treaty \"does not require either government to destroy non-deployed warheads,\" Koch said.\u00a0\"Both governments can still stockpile warheads beyond the agreed-upon limit of 1,550 without violating the treaty.\"\nExcluding the thousands of warheads that have been retired and are awaiting dismantlement, Russia currently has about 4,500 nuclear warheads, including stockpiles and 1,735 deployed warheads, according to Federation for American Scientists estimates.\nRussia\u2019s total nuclear warhead arsenal has been on a steady decline since the 1990s. That decline has nearly stagnated during President Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, hovering at around 4,500 since 2012, according to Federation for American Scientists data.\nThroughout Obama\u2019s tenure \u2014 and Clinton\u2019s term as secretary of state \u2014 Russia has shrunk its total nuclear arsenal far less than it did under the past three presidents. And it would be difficult to attribute any reduction in Russia\u2019s nuclear stockpiles to New START, given that the treaty only limits deployed weapons.\n\"The end of the Cold War, the financial crisis in the 1990s and the START I treaty had a much greater effect on shaping Russia's current and planned nuclear posture than the New START treaty,\" said Hans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, which supports arms control.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that some experts no longer consider stockpiles a serious threat to security. Under New START\u2019s deployed weapons restrictions, the effectiveness of a large stockpile is limited, especially because Russia only produces about 10 missiles per year, according to a report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. Thus the treaty might make it so that Russia does not feel the need to stockpile as many weapons.\nOur ruling\nKaine said Clinton \"went toe-to-toe with Russia as secretary of state to do the New START Agreement to reduce Russia's nuclear stockpile.\"\nNew START cuts the number of strategic weapons that the United States and Russia can have deployed at any time, and Clinton played a key role in treaty negotiations. However, it does not restrict either country from stockpiling weapons, nor does it require them to destroy any existing weapons.\nThe treaty hasn\u2019t cut Russia\u2019s nuclear arms yet. But if it does in the future, after the treaty is fully implemented in 2018, it seems that any reductions would be minimal rather than sweeping. And Russia, for the most part, was actually meeting the treaty\u2019s limits when implementation began.\nWe rate Kaine\u2019s claim Half True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/5c547ab5-4c4f-4dcc-917a-c4b82c8268cf", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04190"}
