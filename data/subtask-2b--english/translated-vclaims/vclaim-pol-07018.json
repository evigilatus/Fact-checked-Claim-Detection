But not rock 'n' roll. So far. The rock legend Bob Sieger has criticized the mine in a song called \"It's Your World,\" a track on Red Out, its first new CD-ROM in eight years. The song, which addresses climate change, includes this line: \"Let's talk about mining in Wisconsin, let's talk about breathing in Beijing.\" In an interview on October 12, 2014 with Detroit News, Seger expanded about his concerns about the Wisconsin project. Gogbek Taknut hopes to build a $1.5 billion mine in the Pinoki Hills in the Iron and Ashland Provinces in the far north of Wisconsin. The article quoted by Seger as saying: \"The Governor, Scott Walker, approved a bill through the state legislature this weekend that there will be no environmental control, \"We want this mine.\" Well, the mine by the river is going through Lake Superior, which is some of the cleanest fresh water in the world. \"But sorry,\" added Seger, \"According to Scott Walker, there will be no supervision, we will build this thing, and it will be nine miles long.\" We tried to get to Seger through his poster, Capitol Records, but we didn't get a response. \u2219 Volume claims since we verified Siegger, who has his own deep face of blows (\"motion of the night,\" \"rewinding,\" etc. We decided to start with our own background lists of volume-related mines: a documentary from Al Jazeera broadcast in 2014 said that the mine site was the \"top of the hill\" of the Great Glacier caves on the National Messenger Islands. It's more like 54 miles. We evaluated the claim for error. The Republic of Ivan Goekye, D-Milwaki, said that the mine would be larger than its council area, which is one of the smallest areas in the state (Tru). The state republic Benny Bernard Schipper, D-Appleton, said the mine would be two thirds the size of Lake Winbago (mostly wrong). The musician and writer Dan Kaufman, native of Wisconsin, raised a number of environmental concerns about the project in an opinion article published in The New York Times. He claimed that the mine \"can be extended for 21 miles\" We've evaluated his claim for half the truth. Surely, in terms of its size and its length of time, the Gogbeck mine will be one of the greatest projects ever seen in Wisconsin. Critics say that the mine poses a threat to surface water resources and groundwater in the Bad River watersheds, which flow to Lake Superior. According to the Department of Natural Resources, it would not approve the mining permit if environmental studies showed that the pit and related operations would cause significant damage to the watershed, and on 9 January 2021 on Twitter, Sarah Godlevsky stated: \"Not all women lost their jobs (in the December Jobs Report), most of whom were black and Latin women. \u2022 15 January 2021, Gogbek Takunit at least one year after applying for a State permit. The \"pre-application\" report submitted to the State states that the size of iron ore deposits is that Gogbeck has rights to be 21 miles. However, it is not known how much of these deposits can be extracted. The company says the first phase of the project will be two holes. Each one will be two miles tall. The first phase of mining will take an estimated 35 years. And then the company will have to request another permit to summarize the remaining deposit. So we're not even halfway to nine miles. No censorship? The second part of Seger's claim, namely, that the mine would be built without \"no environmental control,\" is also a problem. The State Act empowers the management of natural resources to the mine from the beginning to the end, including exploration, sampling, mining and site rehabilitation. This control is already under way. The DNR dedicated to the project shows 15 entries, including correspondence between the company and the State, in relation to the Gogbeck wholesale sampling plans from the site. There are nine entries in another section concerning the company &apos; s application for a storm water permit and more than 20 entries under the Gogbek application for a exploration licence. \"This is a multi-year, multi-million-dollar process before even applying to the state,\" said Bob Sitz, spokesman for Gogbeck Taconet. The next major step for Gogbeck is to apply for a mining permit. This request is expected to come in 2015 and must include the company &apos; s mining plans, site restoration and details of how the company will deal with rock waste. The most important document would be the company &apos; s environmental impact report, which DNR states should include \"expected environmental and socio-economic impacts of the proposed mining project and analysis of alternatives to the project.\" Among the issues to be addressed are the impact of this mine on the region &apos; s air, geology, groundwater, endangered species, wetlands, beauty and socio-economic issues. Once the licence is obtained, the State will have 420 days to review the application. This time frame includes a public hearing period and a general suspension period. \"Tough mining projects are extremely complex and their organization involves a set of administrative codes, including but not limited to those relating to wetlands and waterways, air pollution, waste and material management, wildlife and fisheries, and endangered and endangered species.\" In addition, the United States Army Corps of Engineers will study the impact of the mine on the Bud River watershed under the Federal Clean Water Act. The impact of the project on the scale of the Bad River near Lake Siberian Shipiwa -- already registered against the project -- could pose legal challenges. Our assessment is Seger criticizing the proposed Gogbeck mine, saying it's gonna be nine miles long and works without government supervision. But the size, at first, would be closer to four long miles -- two holes, each about two miles long. The project will be regulated and controlled on several fronts. We assess his claim is wrong. :: Editor &apos; s note: This item has been updated to show that the distance from the proposed mine to the Great Ice Caves of the Lake Rasul Islands is 54 miles.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07018"}
