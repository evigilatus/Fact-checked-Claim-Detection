Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., directed the discussion back to medical debt and bankruptcy \u2014\u00a0citing her own work from Harvard Law School.\n\"Back when I was studying it, two out of three families that ended up in bankruptcy after a serious medical problem had health insurance,\" Warren said.\nThis is a new emphasis in the ongoing debate over health care costs, and the debate over what role health care plays in American finances. Instead of focusing on uninsurance, Warren stepped into whether the insurance people currently have is sufficient.\nBut much of the research around medical debt and bankruptcy is controversial \u2014\u00a0especially Warren\u2019s own work.\u00a0\nWe decided to take a deeper look.\nWhat the research says\nWarren\u2019s campaign directed us to research published in 2009 in the American Journal of\u00a0Medicine. Co-authored by Warren, it looks at a random sample of 2,314 bankruptcy filers from 2007.\u00a0\nThe paper examined what debtors reported as their cause of bankruptcy. Warren is referring here to people who either cited significant direct medical debt, remortgaging a home to pay medical debt, or lost income due to illness.\nIn that category, more than two-thirds of families had health insurance \u2014\u00a0in fact, three-quarters did.\u00a0\nSo from that simple standpoint, the number checks out.\nThe controversy\nBut it isn\u2019t necessarily that simple. This specific paper has long been the subject of controversy. In part, it\u2019s because it focuses on people who have declared bankruptcy, rather than looking at the financial impact of medical debt at large.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScholars are also quick to note that, in the majority of so-called \"medical bankruptcies\" identified in the paper, the issue wasn\u2019t debts incurred to pay off health care bills. Rather, the bigger problem was foregone income because people couldn\u2019t work.\nThat\u2019s fueled a lengthy back-and-forth, in particular over whether this paper is actually useful in determining what role medical debt plays in fueling bankruptcies.\nBut its impact on this specific claim isn\u2019t so clear. That\u2019s because Warren narrowed her statement, and focused on something less disputable.\u00a0\nFor one thing, the paper is clear in finding that two-thirds of families \u2014\u00a0in fact, more than that \u2014 experienced bankruptcy after a medical problem despite having health insurance.\u00a0\nThat finding was \"the headline of the study,\" said Paul Ginsburg, a health economist and professor at the University of Southern California. (Ginsburg also noted the importance of foregone income in driving bankruptcies, rather than medical costs.)\nAnd Warren qualified it further during the debate, by limiting this statistic to what was found \"back when [she] was studying it\" \u2014 making it a less sweeping claim.\nWhat\u2019s more suspect is whether this finding \u2014 even if accurate \u2014 supports her next point: that the cost of health care is what\u2019s driving people\u2019s financial problems, and that a generous single-payer plan would ameliorate this issue.\u00a0\nFor instance, \"You cannot go from that result to a conclusion that we need Medicare For All,\" Ginsburg said.\u00a0\nHealth insurance is more generous today than it was when Warren studied it, thanks to the Affordable Care Act. And insuring everyone \u2014 even as generously as Medicare For All suggests \u2014 wouldn\u2019t necessarily address the issue of foregone income when people are sick, which the research suggests is a bigger financial concern.\nOur ruling\nWarren\u2019s claim comes from a paper that is controversial, and whose methods and interpretation have been called into question. That said, this statistic is fairly specific, and her wording in the claim precise. In itself, it\u2019s a fair reflection of what the paper says.\nWhere caution is more important: Warren says this finding suggests the cost of health care is what\u2019s causing Americans financial harm. That isn\u2019t necessarily borne out, and requires more scrutiny.\nThis statement is accurate but would benefit from more information. We rate it Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00057"}
