Katie Roberts, Richardson's deputy communications director, points to a BBC-sponsored poll of Iraqis in September 2007. BBC says the poll was conducted in face-to-face interviews with 2,212 people \"in more than 450 neighborhoods across all 18 provinces of Iraq in August, and has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.5%.\"\n\n\nBut the poll does not directly support the 65 percent figure. Nor does the poll put the question nearly as starkly as Richardson stated.\n\n\n\"Thinking about the political action of other people,\" the question says, \"do you find each of these items to be acceptable or not acceptable?\" The first item was \"attacks on coalition forces,\" and 57 percent of the respondents found them \"acceptable.\" Among Sunnis, 93 percent said \"acceptable;\" among Shiites, it was 50 percent, and among Kurds, it was 5 percent.\n\n\nIt's not at all clear that the same number would have said it is acceptable if people had been asked, \"Is it okay to shoot an American soldier?\" So Richardson is at least casting the response in more dramatic terms than the question interviewers asked. At the same time, the poll clearly suggests that about half of the Iraqi people consider attacks on coalition forces \"acceptable.\"\n\n\nThe Richardson campaign did not respond to our request to explain the disparity in numbers.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolling expert John G. Geer, professor of political science at Vanderbilt University and editor of the forthcoming\n\nEncyclopedia of Public Opinion,\n\ntheorized that Richardson excluded the responses of Kurds.\n\n\nSure enough, if you subtract the 354 Kurd responses from the 2,212 total, the math supports Richardson's 65 percent figure. This makes sense if you consider many Kurds would eventually like to have a state of their own. But removing the Kurds exaggerates the poll results and does not accurately reflect Richardson's statement, which referred only to \"the Iraqi people.\"\n\n\n\"The question,\" says Geer, \"is whether 'attacks on coalition forces' equates to 'shooting an American soldier,' which of course it doesn't. Possibly they'd be\n\nmore\n\nlikely to say it's acceptable, I don't know.\"\n\n\nHe adds, \"It's generally a fair point to say Iraqis are unhappy with the American presence in Iraq. The general point has some validity, but he's exaggerated. That's what campaigns do.\"\n\n\nAnd what we do is call them on it. Richardson wasn't just \"juicing the numbers,\" as Geer said. He was deliberately hyping the language and hyping the numbers to make a stronger point than the facts justified.
