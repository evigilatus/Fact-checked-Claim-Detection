Here\u2019s the full text from the ad, although this fact-check focuses only on the first case from 2014.\n\"Alabama, there's a pattern.\nIn a 2014 case involving a man convicted of abusing two underage girls, Judge Roy Moore disagreed and wrote the dissenting opinion.\nIn a 2015 case involving a man who pleaded guilty to raping an underage girl, Roy Moore dissented again.\nAnd Roy Moore was the only Supreme Court justice who sided with a felon convicted of sexual abuse of a child at a daycare center.\nCourt documents, real facts.\nRoy Moore's disturbing conduct.\"\nOn television, the visuals are important. Here\u2019s what viewers saw.\n\nIn one of the most reliably Republican states, Moore has been fighting headwinds after multiple reports that he made sexual advances on young women under 18 when he was in his 30s. The Jones attack ad plays to that issue.\nIn the 2014 case, Jones misappropriated\u00a0technical elements of the legal saga to leave voters with the wrong idea.\nThe 2014 case\nIn 2010, Sherman Fitzgerald Tate, then in his mid 30s, worked as a mentor with the Youth Advocate Program at Pointe Academy in Mobile, Ala. The court-funded program aimed to help troubled teens. A security camera recorded Tate bringing two 15-year-old girls into a conference room. He was not their assigned mentor. There was no tape of what took place inside the room. The two girls accused him of coercing them to touch him and each other sexually.\nTate was convicted on two counts of second-degree sodomy.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL. Lin Wood\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in an interview with the Patriotically Correct Radio Show\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"China was behind the interference and the effort to overthrow our government and the election, election fraud.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Daniel Funke \u2022 January 19, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHis lawyer wanted to bring in testimony that the two girls had a romantic relationship with each other and that Tate had told one of the girls\u2019 mother about it. That information would, the lawyer said, give the girls a reason to invent a charge against Tate.\nBut under Alabama law, victims of sexual assault are shielded from any exploration of their past sexual activity, because it could bias a jury against them. This is a fundamental principle that holds in many states. The trial judge blocked the testimony and an appeals court agreed.\nTate\u2019s lawyer brought the issue to the state supreme court. The majority of the justices, five, declined to hear the case. Moore and two other justices disagreed.\nIn his dissent, Moore basically argued that courts in Massachusetts, Mississippi, Colorado and elsewhere had allowed similar evidence in certain cases and there was a reasonable argument that the facts in Tate\u2019s case \"would make the proposed cross-examination relevant to show that the victims had possibly fabricated the charges against Tate.\"\nThe key line in Moore\u2019s dissent, however, is the last one:\u00a0\"I believe that we should resolve this material question of first impression.\" In other words, Moore's dissent was about resolving the legal question for future cases.\nA matter of law\nWe reached several experts in appellate law and all of them agreed that Moore was only arguing that the court should hear the case.\n\"He was saying there\u2019s a decent legal issue in the case that the court ought to resolve,\" David Moran at the University of Michigan Law School. \"It read like a perfectly reasonable dissent, and it would be grossly unfair to attribute anything to him based on a dissent from a denial of review.\"\nPeter Smith at George Washington University Law School agreed, saying that at that point in the process, Moore was not challenging the case itself against Tate, but the legal issue of what testimony was admissible.\n\"In theory, if the court had heard the case, he could have ruled against the guy,\" Smith said.\nSmith said Moore was telegraphing some sympathy for Tate\u2019s position, but again, this dissent alone did not amount to disagreeing with Tate\u2019s conviction.\nThe other two cases\nThe ad raises two other cases to show Moore\u2019s \"disturbing conduct.\"\nThe 2015 case involved second-degree rape and like the charges against Tate, the issue was whether the sexual activity of the victim should have been presented at the trial. Moore and two other justices joined in saying the court should decide the matter.\nIn the ad\u2019s final example, Moore was the lone dissenter. The case involved a 17-year-old boy who performed a sexual act on a 4-year-old boy at a daycare center. The teen was convicted on two counts -- first-degree sodomy of a child under 12 and first-degree sodomy by forcible compulsion.\nMoore took issue with the second count, arguing that there was no evidence of an implied threat of serious physical injury or death in the case. The matter was made more complicated because the offender was under 18, which put him in a gray zone under state law. Moore argued that the court was going beyond what lawmakers had written.\nOur ruling\nAn ad from the Jones campaign said that Moore disagreed and dissented in a case involving the abuse of two underage girls. There is no question that Moore dissented, but the ad provides no context for what Moore disagreed with. The glaring lack of detail leaves reasonable viewers with the impression that\u00a0Moore disagreed with the conviction.\nThat\u2019s not what he said. He disagreed with the court\u2019s decision not to consider a legal question of admissible evidence. Several independent law professors told us that Moore raised a valid point that was legally separate from the underlying conviction in the case.\nThe ad leaves out critical context that gives a highly misleading impression.\u00a0We rate this claim Mostly False.\n Share the Facts 2017-12-06 23:02:28 UTC   PolitiFact    3 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly False  \"In a 2014 case involving a man convicted of abusing two underage girls, Judge Roy Moore disagreed and wrote the dissenting opinion.\"    Doug Jones Democratic candidate for senator for Alabama https://youtu.be/x52Js6Chy_Y   In an attack ad Thursday, November 30, 2017 2017-11-30    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02620"}
