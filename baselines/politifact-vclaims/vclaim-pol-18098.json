Among other signs:\n\n\nThe latest jobs report from 2018 showed just over 100 jobs eligible for tax credits (2019 figures aren\u2019t out yet).\u00a0\n\n\nA timeline attached to the state credit application called for $2.1 billion in construction spending at the end of 2019. Foxconn has so far awarded about $370 million in contracts.\n\n\nThe company has abandoned plans to build the latest \"Generation 10.5\" screens as originally promised in favor of a \"Generation 6\" plant.\n\n\nU.S. Rep.\u00a0Gwen Moore, D-Wisconsin, is getting impatient.\n\"(President Donald) Trump promised 13,000 new jobs to the people of #Wisconsin,\" she tweeted Feb. 14, 2020. \"3 years later, we\u2019re still waiting\u2026\"\nMoore raises Trump\u2019s role in the process, while also implying those 13,000 jobs are overdue. We checked out both elements of her claim.\nTrump front and center for Foxconn\nTrump has played a high-profile role throughout the Foxconn project.\nAfter a series of media reports raised the specter Foxconn might scale back or even suspend its Wisconsin plans, Trump spoke with then-CEO and Chairman Terry Gou. The company then announced in February 2019 it was still building a liquid crystal display manufacturing plant in Wisconsin.\nTrump had also been present for the groundbreaking in June 2018, where he said this:\n\"Moments ago we broke ground on a plant that will provide jobs for much more than 13,000 Wisconsin workers,\" the president said. \"Really something.\"\n\n\n\n\nHe tweeted the same day that the plant \"will provide jobs for up to 15,000 Wisconsin Workers.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s fair for Moore to summarize this as promising 13,000 jobs, since Trump made these claims without attribution or qualification.\nTimeline is hard to pin down\nMoore\u2019s \"still waiting\" claim doesn\u2019t fare so well.\nHer phrasing implies the jobs should have been here three years ago, or at the very least should by now.\nThat was never the promise.\nA memorandum of understanding between Foxconn and the state in July 2017 said the company \"agrees to \u2026 create up to 13,000 jobs with an estimated average salary of $53,875 over a period of up to six years.\"\nThe formal agreement signed in November 2017 moved that up a bit, saying Foxconn agrees \"to the best of their ability, to projected employment of 13,000 jobs of hourly and salaried personnel of Wisconsin payroll between 2018 and the end of 2022.\" It goes on to note the headcount is subject to timely construction and \"business needs.\"\nWhen it comes to qualifying to get the tax credits, the timeline is a bit looser than that.\nFoxconn would need 13,000 jobs by 2022 to get the maximum available tax credits from the state, according to a credit disbursement schedule attached to the agreement. But that document also shows a minimum number of jobs needed to get some level of state credits, and that requires 5,200 jobs by 2022. That minimum threshold tops out at 10,400 in 2027, so Foxconn could get some level of incentives each year without ever reaching 13,000 jobs.\nThe actual jobs count for Foxconn isn\u2019t currently available. The company is required to report jobs for the prior year to the state by each April 1, and they have not yet reported 2019 figures. For 2018, Foxconn reported 189 jobs at the end of the year, of which 113 were deemed eligible for tax credits by the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp.\n\nThe company declined to provide a specific jobs number to PolitiFact Wisconsin, simply noting that Foxconn has so far \"invested millions of dollars in Wisconsin while hiring hundreds of hardworking Foxconn employees.\"\nFor maximum tax credits, Foxconn had to have 1,040 employees at the end of 2018 and 2,080 at the end of 2019.\nOur ruling\nMoore said Trump promised 13,000 new jobs, and \"we\u2019re still waiting\" three years later.\nShe\u2019s right that Trump referred to the jobs figure in what could reasonably be called a promise. But she\u2019s off base with the impatient tone that implies those jobs are somehow overdue.\nThe earliest date that could be seen as a deadline for 13,000 jobs is 2022, since Foxconn said in the state agreement it would seek to hire that many in that timeframe. While Foxconn\u2019s progress has been slow, it\u2019s not fair to claim we should be at 13,000 jobs by now.\nWe rate Moore\u2019s claim Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18098"}
