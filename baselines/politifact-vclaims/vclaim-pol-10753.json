Obama then referred, without details, to his administration\u2019s recent decision not to seek deportations of young, otherwise law-abiding illegal immigrants.\n\n\"I believe we can secure our borders and give opportunities to people who are striving and working hard -- especially young people who have been raised in this country and see themselves as Americans. \u00a0That was the right thing to do. We're not going backwards; we're going forwards.\"\n\nWe wondered if Obama journeyed backward by saying Romney called the Arizona immigration law a model for the nation -- which he also said later the same day at the Austin Music Hall.\n\nNoticeably, the president\u2019s statement repeated a claim we checked before by U.S. Rep. Charlie Gonzalez, D-San Antonio. Gonzalez said in a March 27, 2012, conference call organized by the Democratic National Committee that while in Arizona, Romney had said he believes that the state\u2019s much-debated immigration-enforcement law \u2014 which originated in 2010 as Senate Bill 1070 \u2014 should be the template for federal immigration laws, a stance that Gonzalez described as disturbing.\n\nGonzalez\u2019s comment to reporters: \"Gov. Romney has actually (said) \u2014 while he was in Arizona, of course, and I understand that he was basically maybe playing up to the Arizona crowd \u2014 he felt that SB 1070, which has made its way up to the Supreme Court of the United States and will be argued in April, he believes that it should be the template, it should be the model for United States immigration law, not comprehensive immigration reform as the more responsible individuals in Congress have been espousing for a number of years, but an extreme version of an anti-immigrant law passed by the Arizona Legislature.\"\n\nAfter Gonzalez made that statement, the U.S. Supreme Court in June 2012 threw out parts of the Arizona law that would have made state crimes out of federal immigration violations including provisions requiring immigrants to obtain or carry immigration registration papers, making it a state criminal offense for an illegal immigrant to seek work or hold a job and allowing police to arrest suspected illegal immigrants without warrants, as reported by The Associated Press.\n\nHowever, the court let stand a \"show me your papers\" requirement that police officers check the status of people stopped for various reasons who might appear to be in the U.S. illegally. Even then, the AP reported, the justices said the provision could be subject to additional legal challenges. And they removed some teeth by prohibiting officers from arresting people on immigration charges.\n\nAccording to the AP, Romney did not immediately comment on the decision, though he said he believes that \"each state has the duty \u2014 and the right \u2014 to secure our borders and preserve the rule of law, particularly when the federal government has failed to meet its responsibilities.\"\n\nNow back to whether Romney referred to the Arizona law as a model.\n\nIn our check of Gonzalez, DNC spokesman Ricardo Ramirez pointed us to an answer Romney gave during the Feb. 22, 2012, Republican presidential debate in Arizona.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWe found that Romney did not say in the debate that Arizona's 2010 law should be adopted by Congress in lieu of comprehensive immigration reform; his reply to a question focused instead on a different, older Arizona statute.\n\nThat said, we see how his reply could be misread.\n\nAs John King of CNN framed his question to Romney, crowd members applauded mention of Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Arizona\u2019s Maricopa County, shown in attendance, who is known for his advocacy of tough immigration policies. Then King said to Romney: \"You've talked, governor, about self-deportation, if businesses do their job, asking for the right documents, the people will leave. But what about arresting? Should there be aggressive, seek them out, find them and arrest them as Sheriff Arpaio advocates?\"\n\n\"You know, I think you see a model here in Arizona,\" Romney answered. \"They passed a law here that says, that says that people who come here and try and find work, that the employer is required to look them up on E-Verify. This E-Verify system allows employers in Arizona to know who's here legally and who's not here legally. And as a result of E-Verify being put in place, the number of people in Arizona that are here illegally has dropped by some 14 percent, where the national average has only gone down 7 percent.\"\n\nE-Verify is a federal, Internet-based system that employers can use to verify whether someone is authorized to work in the United States. Participation is voluntary for most U.S. businesses; there is no federal mandate. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security\u2019s website says that more than 280,000 employers across the country are using the system.\n\nAfter the Arizona debate, many reporters, opinion columnists, Democrats and liberal groups interpreted that statement by Romney as him saying that SB 1070 as a whole should be a model, either for the nation or for other states.\n\nHowever, Dan Nowicki, the Arizona Republic\u2019s national political reporter, questioned those interpretations in a March 3, 2012, news article, pointing out that Arizona\u2019s requirement that businesses use E-Verify is not contained in SB 1070 but in an earlier state law, the Legal Arizona Workers Act.\n\n\"It's clear from the (debate) transcript that Romney was describing part of the state's 2007 employer-sanctions law, which has been upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court,\" Nowicki wrote. \"That Arizona law requires employers to use a federal electronic system to verify whether new hires are eligible to work in the United States and provides punishment for companies that hire undocumented immigrants.\"\n\nAccording to Nowicki\u2019s article, Romney spokesman Ryan Williams told the Republic that in the Arizona debate, Romney was referring to the E-Verify requirement as the model and not SB 1070. Williams reiterated that statement to us in an email.\n\nRamirez, of the DNC, also pointed to the rest of Romney\u2019s debate response in the Feb. 22 debate as backup for Gonzalez\u2019s claim.\n\nThe remainder of Romney\u2019s answer: \"So going back to the question that was asked, the right course for America is to drop these lawsuits against Arizona and other states that are trying to do the job Barack Obama isn't doing. And I will drop those lawsuits on day one. I'll also complete the fence. I'll make sure we have enough Border Patrol agents to secure the fence. And I will make sure we have an E-Verify system and require employers to check the documents of workers, and to check E-Verify. And if an employer hires someone that has not gone through E- Verify, they're going to get sanctioned just like they do for not paying their taxes. You do that, and just as Arizona is finding out, you can stop illegal immigration. It's time we finally did it.\"\n\nSo, Romney in the debate saluted the E-Verify element of a 5-year-old Arizona law \u2014 which was not part of the 2010 immigration-enforcement law that Gonzalez says Romney called a model for the nation.\n\nThen again, Romney also said he would end the federal challenge to the 2010 law on his first day as president.\n\nObama\u2019s campaign, asked to back up his San Antonio claim, emailed a statement describing Romney as extreme on immigration issues. The statement did not show that Romney considers the Arizona law a model for the nation.\n\nOur ruling\n\nObama could legitimately have targeted Romney\u2019s vow to immediately drop the federal challenge to Arizona\u2019s immigration-enforcement law as president. Instead, the Democrat\u2019s statement mischaracterizes Romney\u2019s salute to Arizona\u2019s 2007 mandate that employers electronically verify the legal status of employees. That E-Verify requirement was not in the 2010 Arizona law.\n\nWe rate Obama\u2019s claim as False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10753"}
