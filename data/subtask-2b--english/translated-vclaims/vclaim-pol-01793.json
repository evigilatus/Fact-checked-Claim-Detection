This includes the honest Abe Lincoln and Ronald Reagan. There must be something wrong, please recheck that poll! Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTromp) 29 July 2018 was not the first time he said anything similar. On July 10th, he said in a tweet, \"The new urine says Trump, 90%, is the most popular Republican in the party's history.\" Three days later, in an interview with the British newspaper Sun, Trump said, \"You know, I just showed up to think that I'm the most popular person in the history of the Republican Party. He hit Lincoln. \"I have overcome the true Abe.\" Trump has reason to complain about his popularity among Republicans: his degree of approval within his party has ranged from 84% to 90% since mid-April 2018. The estimates of approval between the Republicans \"move within a narrow range,\" said Carlin Bowman, polling analyst with the American Institute of Enterprise. \"It's too high and too stable.\" The media have taken note of this. On about the 500th day of Trump in office on June 4, there was a wave of articles indicating that the estimates of Trump's approval at that stage of their term were higher than those of most former Republican Presidents, at least among the respondents in their party. For example, the Daily Mail - the longest rolling source of presidential approval estimates - was quoted by the Daily Mail to report that the Republican support for Trump, which was 87 per cent at the time, was higher on its fifty-fifth day than any post-war president except George W. Bush, who was 96 per cent with the Republicans after the 9/11 attacks. (In this matter, no democracy had a higher appreciation with Democrats than Trump with Republicans.) But the way Trump expressed his tweet was problematic. One of the concerns is to vote at Abe's honest time - precisely, his absence. The other relates to higher estimates of approval by the new Republican Presidents. There were no scientific polls on Lincoln Day in non-scientific polls until at least 1824, with \"informal experimental heat records\" \"received in separate bars, militia offices, and public meetings,\" books by D. Sunshine Hillygus, a political scientist from Duke University. However, surveys in Lincoln's time are not considered scientific. The idea of a scientific poll itself came after a catastrophic referendum in 1936 by Literary Digest, a popular magazine. The opinion poll conducted by the magazine was based on responses from millions of Americans, but the data it collected differed significantly from the demographic balance of the electorate as a whole. This lack of scientific rigour led to a vote on the error of the 1936 presidential election, opening the door to the survey roads called by George Gallup and others. Gallup started voting in 1935 using a different method than today, but it's strict for his time. The early polls conducted by Gallup identified the demographic composition of the voters, and then tasked surveyers to visit remote areas in order to interview respondents with specific demographic characteristics. Today, well-known opinion pollers use a better system: random sampling to select telephone numbers from across the country, which they then contact to ask standardized and carefully formulated questions. The assumption is that a truly random sample will clone the entire nation into the microcom within a few percentage points of accuracy (\"the usual margin of error\"). For modern voting, the industry has had to adapt its methods to take into account factors such as the increasing use of cellular phones. One new type of voting is based on the \"team\" of voters on the Internet designed to reflect the demographic characteristics of voters. Despite the shortcomings of scientific polling, it is still the best available tool. And Lincoln never confronted him. The Trump position among the Republicans is high, but it is not the highest place at all now. Let us look at the only Republican Presidents for whom the scientific ballot data are available. The most recent data available to the public from the Gallup weekly tracking survey showed at the time of his Trump tweet with the approval of 85% of the Republicans. So how does this estimate compare 85% with his Republican ancestors? We searched Gallup's historical statements of Republican Presidents returning to Eisenhower. We searched for the closest ballot for July 29th of their second year in office (Trap Claim Day). We used the equivalent period after Gerald Ford was installed, which, unlike others, was not sworn in in January 20. The President's degree of approval among Republicans, close to July 29, is Donald Trump 85 percent George W. Bush 96 percent George H.W. ==External links==* 79% or 91% Ronald Reagan 74% Gerald Ford 67% Richard Nixon 81% Dwight Eisenhower 92% So, from the point of view of Trump's tweet, George W. Bush wasn't just getting a higher degree of approval among Republicans, but also Dwight Eisenhower, and you can say, George H.W. (Bosch) There are two other points of comparison that make Trump &apos; s achievement less impressive. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 On January 11, 2021, it is planned to compare the highest degree of consent of Trump to take office so far - 90 per cent in mid-July recently - with the highest standard score of his predecessors until 29 July of the second year of their term. The highest degree of approval among Republicans until July 29th of the second year is Donald Trump 90 percent George W. Bush 99 percent George H.W. Bush 94 percent Ronald Reagan 92 percent Gerald Ford 77 percent Richard Nixon 90 percent Dwight Eisenhower 92 percent by this measure, Another approach would be to compare each President at the highest level of approval in his or her tenure. (Timbeh was in office for only a year and a half, but he opened the door to this analysis by claiming \"the highest ballot number in the history of the Republican Party.\") The president with the highest degree of approval among Republicans, full-time Donald Trump 90 percent George W. Bush 99 percent George H.W. The Bush 97 percent Ronald Reagan 94 percent Gerald Ford 80 percent Richard Nixon 91 percent Dwight Eisenhower 95 percent again, by these measures, According to historical standards, Trump was \"sustained, but not unusual consent within the party,\" and Kathleen Joyce Wilden, Director of Data Operations and Communications at the Roper Public Opinion Research Centre at Cornell University, said. It should be noted that in some cases differences are small and can be within the margin of error. Although Trump is still popular among Republicans, it should be noted that the degree of inter-American approval is slightly lower. (All those who preceded him at that stage in their presidency exceeded the 40 percent that Trump received.) Meanwhile, a smaller proportion of Americans define themselves as Republicans, as Stephen Smith said, a politician at the University of Washington, St. Louis. According to Gallup, Americans who call themselves Republicans accounted for 31% of February 1-5, 2017, the first measure after Trump was inaugurated. But between March and July 2018, this number ranged from 23% to 27%. While the transition is small, Smith said, it may be a sign that some of the tramp critics within the Republican Party are simply leaving the party for the time being, rather than registering a negative assessment of the candidates for the election as Republicans. Our Governor Trump said, \"Wow, Paul's highest numbers in the history of the Republican Party. This includes honest Abby Lincoln and Ronald Reagan. The credit that deserves credit: Trump is very famous among Republicans, and at some point, his consent was evaluated within his party only by George W. Bush among Republican Presidents in the post-war period. However, before 1936, there was no single butler in an era with scientific polls, so Trump compared himself with Lincoln is false. At the same time, Trump's evaluation at the time of tweeting was classified in the middle of the post-Second World War period by Republican Presidents, and measured in other ways, his support among Republicans was actually worse than every post-war Republican president except Gerald Ford. We're assessing the statement wrong. Sharing the facts 2018-07-30 21:37:39 UTC PoliticsFact 2 1 7 PolityFacting: failed \"Wow, the highest number of votes in the history of the Republican Party.
