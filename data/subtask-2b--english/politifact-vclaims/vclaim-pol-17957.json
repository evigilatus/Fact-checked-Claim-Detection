It has thousands of likes, and several similar posts have been shared by other Instagram and Facebook users \u2014\u00a0including at least one candidate running for Senate.\n\n(Screenshot from Instagram)\nSince the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody in late May, demonstrators around the country have protested against police brutality and discrimination against black Americans. Some activists have called to \"defund the police.\"\nDid Hitler \u2014 who oversaw the murder of millions of Jews and other marginalized groups during the Holocaust \u2014\u00a0call for a similar action? We opened our history books to investigate.\nThe Instagram post is inaccurate. While the Nazis reorganized German police forces, it had nothing to do with elections \u2014\u00a0and they did not defund or eliminate police departments. The photo in the post shows Nazis blocking Jews from entering the University of Vienna in 1938.\n\"There was literally no movement ever to defund or eliminate police departments in Nazi Germany,\" said Waitman Beorn, a senior lecturer in history at Northumbria University, in a Twitter thread about the post. \"The terminology of \u2018defunding the police\u2019 has no analogy there.\"\nHow the Nazis reorganized German police\nFirst, let\u2019s review some facts about G\u00f6ring, Hitler\u2019s rise to power and the \"Brownshirts.\"\nG\u00f6ring was a high-ranking Nazi official and one of Hitler\u2019s closest allies. He is credited with helping to create the Nazi police state in Germany.\nG\u00f6ring joined the National Socialist German Workers\u2019 (Nazi) Party in 1922. Hitler, who had assumed control of the party one year prior, gave G\u00f6ring command of the Brownshirts or \"Storm Troopers,\" officially known as the Sturmabteilung (SA). The paramilitary organization was outfitted in brown uniforms and tasked with protecting party meetings, intimidating voters and assaulting political opponents.\nIn 1932, after the Nazis won 230 seats in the Reichstag, G\u00f6ring was elected president of the German legislative body. But Paul von Hindenburg, president of the Weimar Republic, was reluctant to appoint Hitler as chancellor.\u00a0\nThat changed in January 1933, when \u2014 after a series of negotiations \u2014 Hitler was appointed head of state.\nAfter Hitler became chancellor, he appointed G\u00f6ring to his cabinet and, later, interior minister of Prussia \u2014\u00a0not of the entire country, as the Instagram post implies. And instead of eliminating police forces, he created a new one.\nG\u00f6ring used his position to Nazify the Prussian police and establish the Gestapo. The political police force was tasked with eliminating opposition to the party and later worked in tandem with the Schutzstaffel (SS) to deport Jews to concentration camps.\n\"This had ZERO to do with elections. There were no more free elections after 1933,\" Beorn said in his Twitter thread.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRELATED: No, gun control regulation in Nazi Germany did not help advance the Holocaust\nIn February 1933, G\u00f6ring authorized the appointment of the SA and the SS as auxiliary police personnel, which co-opted the Brownshirts into the regular police force. Simultaneously, Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS, similarly reorganized the police of the remaining German states. In April 1933, the Nazis passed a law that allowed state interior ministries to purge police personnel, which led to the firing of \"non-Aryan\" officers and those who had opposed the Nazis.\nThat strategy \u2014\u00a0while it did fundamentally change the nature of policing in Germany in the lead-up to World War II \u2014 was not akin to defunding and eliminating police departments.\n\"The very moment the Nazis were in power in each of the German states, they could simply change personnel as well as policies in local police departments,\" said Thomas Weber, a history and international affairs professor at the University of Aberdeen who has authored several books about Hitler. \"This meant that the Nazis had full control over police departments the moment they took over the state government in which that particular police department lay.\"\n\"It would thus simply have made no sense for the Nazis to defund or eliminate police departments, as they already had full control over them.\"\nWhat \u2018defund the police\u2019 means in 2020\n\"Defund the police\" has become a rallying cry for some activists protesting police brutality against black Americans. But the phrase means different things to different people.\nIn a June 8 \"Ask Me Anything\" thread on Reddit, Kailee Scales, managing director of the Black Lives Matter Global Network, said the group is calling for \"divestment in police in order to support more teachers, mental health and restorative services, and community resilience departments, social workers, and government resource liaisons.\"\n\"I know that sounds like a lot to take in, but simply, it is the idea of creating the \u2018American Dream\u2019 for all \u2014 less cops on streets and better schools and social programming,\" she said in the thread.\nThe argument for defunding the police goes like this: Many police departments across the country have large budgets. Other departments, such as those that oversee public health and family services, have smaller budgets. Some activists say that, by shifting money from police departments to other parts of municipal government, violence against black Americans would go down.\nMeanwhile, some are calling for police departments to be abolished altogether.\nIn Minneapolis, where Floyd died after a white police officer kneeled on his neck, most city council members have pledged to dismantle the police department.\u00a0\n\"Decades of police reform efforts have proved that the Minneapolis Police Department cannot be reformed and will never be accountable for its actions,\" council members said at a June 7 meeting. \"We are here today to begin the process of ending the Minneapolis Police Department and creating a new, transformative model for cultivating safety in Minneapolis.\"\nRELATED: \u2018Defund the police\u2019 movement: What do activists mean by that?\nHowever, the details are still up in the air. Council President Lisa Bender tweeted that the police department would be replaced \"with a transformative new model of public safety.\" But she has also said that, while she doesn\u2019t want to invest in more policing, the idea of having no police department \"is certainly not\" in the short-term plan.\nRegardless, both abolishing and defunding the police are very different from Hitler and G\u00f6ring\u2019s strategy of Nazifying the police in 1930s Germany. However, the distinction comes with a caveat.\n\"When the Nazis came to power, they eliminated police unions, as they viewed unions of policemen as anti-Nazi institutions,\" Weber said. \"So the Nazis did defund and eliminate police unions in 1933, but they certainly did not defund and eliminate police departments.\"\nOur ruling\nAn Instagram post claims that Nazi\u2019s defunded and eliminated police departments in Germany.\nThat\u2019s wrong. In reality, the Nazis relied on police forces to maintain control of Germany and commit genocide in the lead-up to World War II. That is very different from today\u2019s calls to \"defund the police,\" which can mean anything from divesting from police departments to abolishing the police altogether.\nThe Instagram post is inaccurate.
