That calculation was made by downloading a zipped file of the code, unzipping it and running it through Microsoft Word\u2019s word count feature, according to a footnote in the report. A 2012 version of the report puts the number of words in the code at \"about 4 million.\"\nWe also reached out to CCH, the Riverwoods, Ill.-based publisher of the two-volume 2013 Winter version of the tax code and was told the best estimate of word length was 4 million.\nThat was two years ago, but we think it\u2019s a safe bet that the length of the tax code has only increased since then, not decreased.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

Haley professor of Old Testament Theology at the Princeton Theological Seminary, told PolitiFact New Jersey that a fair approximation of the Bible\u2019s length is 800,000 words for the Old and New testaments combined.\n\"The King James Version would be 823,156 while the more recent New Revised Standard Version would be 774,746 words,\" Olson said.\nHellen Mardaga, an assistant professor of New Testament at Catholic University in Washington, agreed that estimates that put the Bible at 800,000 words were credible.\nPut it all together and the tax code is roughly five times as long as the Bible. So Cruz is correct.\nOur ruling\nCruz said, \"There are more words in the IRS code than there are in the Bible.\"\nIt\u2019s generally accepted that the tax code is about 4 million words long and that the Bible is about 800,000. That\u2019s five times as long. So Cruz\u2019s claim is True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05749"}
