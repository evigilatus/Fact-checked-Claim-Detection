Public schools wasted taxpayers &apos; money. \"Let's review the numbers. At the state and federal level, the United States spends more than $620 billion on K-12 education every year, \"Trap said September 8, 2016. \"This average is approximately $12,296 per student enrolled in our primary and secondary public schools. The Federal Government pays about 10 per cent of K-12 costs. The other approximately $560 billion spent on K-12 education comes from the same states. We spend more each student than any other major country in the world. We're doing very badly in terms of list A.\" In January, Tramp made a similar statement on spending on education in the United States, saying: \"No. One for each pupil with a factor of four.\" The statement was assessed by Polift Vac as often a liar because it was exaggerated. This new claim is a little more modest. Does the United States spend more on every student than other major countries? \"The question is, how can you define \"mainity?\" said Neil McCluskey, Director of the Centre for Educational Freedom at the Liberal Cato Institute. He is in favour of reducing federal participation in K-12 education. McCluskey relies on data from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), a consortium of 34 member countries that shares internationally comparable statistical, economic and social data. Their educational statistics from 2012 were the most recent available statistics at the time of the Trump Statement. According to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), Switzerland spends the largest $15,500 per student, followed by Norway and the United States. Switzerland ranks first in the global competitiveness index, which classifies economic power. Norway is not very depressed at 11:00. The United States is the third. Tony Evers mentioned on January 12, 2021 in his speech: \"We put $330 million in public school aid - the largest in more than a decade.\" \u2022 26 January 2021 The expenditure per student in the United States at the primary/secondary level was 31 per cent higher than the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development average expenditure of $9,000. \"Sure is the case that spends more than almost any country except Norway and Switzerland,\" said McCluskey. Very few countries outnumber us in absolute terms. The United Kingdom, Japan and Germany all spend less than we do. I suppose you could say they're all adults.\" The financial figures for Trump - $620 billion for K-12 education nationwide, or $12,296 per student, on average - are equivalent to the totals reported by the National Centre for Education Statistics. A conclusion from the 2012 International Student Assessment Programme, a test conducted for 15-year-old students in 65 countries, called on the United States for high spending and poor performance. \"while the United States spends more on every student from most countries, this does not translate into better performance,\" I read. American students &apos; degrees in the test were average. In mathematics, 15-year-old Americans ranked the number. 26 out of 34 participating countries. This is consistent with Trump's assessment that \"our business is very bad,\" the wisdom of education. \"For a country that spends as much as we do, you think we'll have the best results,\" said McCluskey. Our Governor Trump said that in the United States he spent \"more per student than almost any other major country in the world.\" That Trump's assertion that American taxpayers do not get enough of a blow to their relative dollar, when our students' test scores are classified all over the world, is noted. The most recent figures put the United States third in government spending on education, behind Switzerland and Norway. We assess Trump &apos; s claim for honesty. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/93229a59-9bef-456f-937a-tedc1dfca1e", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04290"}
