My grandfather's bias, Trump said in November 27. The last was in a series of 13 tweets, where Trump claimed, without proof, \"millions of people\" across the country illegally voted on November 8, stealing him from a plurality of popular votes - although he won the crucial majority of total votes. The latest returns showed that the Hilary Clinton Democratic Party received about 2.3 million more popular votes than Trump, the Republican. Our colleagues at Poletti Fact National considered Trump's claim that millions had voted illegally and assessed them with pants on fire. We investigated Trump's claim about Virginia, to see if \"serious voter fraud\" occurred in the state. Clinton won Virginia, obtaining 1.98 million votes compared to 1.77 million Trump, according to statistics published by the Virginia Electoral Administration. In other words, I got about 210,000 votes over Trump. We e-mailed Trump's campaign and his transition team to find out the basis for his allegation of fraud, but we didn't get a response. While Trump's comments are being reported, the Virginia Electoral Department issued a statement prepared by Commissioner Edgardo Curtis, who dropped the President-elect's statement. \"The allegations of voter fraud in Virginia during the November 8 elections are unfounded,\" said Curtis. \"The election of Virginia was well conducted by 133 professional local registrars, assisted by hundreds of election officials and volunteers who worked to ensure good experience for qualified voters in Virginia. The elections were fair and all the votes cast by the eligible voters were accurately counted.\" Martin Mash, Electoral Management Policy Adviser, told us in an e-mail that the Department had not received any specific allegations of electoral fraud during the November 8 elections. Allegations of vote fraud would be transmitted to law enforcement officials. Michael Kelly, spokesman for Democratic Prosecutor Mark Herring, said in an e-mail that his office had received no reports of illegal voting in these elections. We contacted John Frederics, who was the head of the Trump campaign in Virginia. On election day, he said that officials from the Trump and GOP State Campaign had established a focal point in Richmond to receive reports of voting irregularities. Although the Centre received hundreds of calls, nothing caused great concern, he said. On January 10, 2021, in an article on Facebook, he said that Nancy Belusi had sent a letter to the mayor of Portland after demonstrations there \"requiring him to stick to a proven democratic playbook.\" By Sira O'Rourke on January 11, 2021 Frederick told us that he was not aware of any \"big voter fraud on election day\" that goes beyond \"many isolated incidents\" by people who vote without a valid identity want to vote. Fredericks added that flaws in the state electoral system provided avenues for illegal ballots and that there were \"real examples of possible real fraud of voters or the basis for falsification of votes.\" For example, Fredericks referred to a known case from Harrisonburg, where 18 to 20 people who died ended up on the voters' lists. The FBI is examining this case of possible fraud of voters. It should be noted, however, that this violation was discovered in September - well before election day. Another case being tried in Alexandria concerns what appears to be a relatively small number of false voter registration applications, which were also found before the election day, and the Richmond Times-Dispatch referred to in an article this week. We also sent an e-mail to the Republican Party in Virginia to accept Trump's claim of \"serious voter fraud.\" The President of the Republican Party, John Whitbeck, said that the Republicans in the states would hand over to the next White House administration to respond to Trump's claim. Last note: Our colleagues in Politi, Vakt, New Hampshire and Polite, have also given California pants on fire classifications to claim Trump's dangerous forgery of voters in these states. Our verdict, Trump, said there was a \"serious fraud of voters in Virginia\" during this presidential election. The State's Supreme Electoral Officer in Virginia says the charge is \"unfounded.\" The former President of the Trump Virginia campaign says that he is unaware of any \"big voter fraud on election day.\" There is a burden on Trump to prove his sensational claim, and the President-elect does not provide any evidence. We evaluate his statement with pants on fire. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/84f77a8d-d9e2-4cb8-be2d-a26a237887b2", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03909"}
