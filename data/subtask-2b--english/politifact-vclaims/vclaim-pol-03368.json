Mark Pocan was correct when he painted a different picture in Metro Weekly, a Washington, D.C. publication that serves the LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning) community.\nAsked in the April 7, 2017 article whether \"underrepresented groups, either minorities or women or LGBTQ people,\" will get more politically active, Pocan said he hoped so.\nThe Wisconsin Democrat also recited a quote he attributed to the late Ann Richards, a Democrat who was the governor of Texas before George W. Bush: \"If you don\u2019t have a seat at the table, you\u2019re likely on the menu.\" And then he said:\nWhen you look at the floor of Congress, it\u2019s especially telling. On the Democratic side of the room, you\u2019ve got men and women of all different races. On the other side, you\u2019ve got a bunch of white men in dark suits, all over 55 or so. It\u2019s such a contrast. That\u2019s not representative of the country. We really need to get people making sure that everyone has a voice.\nWhat we found is Pocan is largely on target, in that Democrats are more diverse, although there are more than older white men among Republicans.\nGender diversity\nWe\u2019ll tackle Pocan\u2019s claim in three parts. We base our analysis primarily on a March 2017 report on the current makeup of the House and Senate by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, which provides policy and legal analysis for Congress. Taking into account vacancies and independents, it lists 289 Republicans and 239 Democrats among the 535 voting members of the two chambers.\nThe first part of Pocan\u2019s claim is about women. The report shows that Democrats, even though they are outnumbered by Republicans, have three times more women in the two chambers.\n\n\n\n\nDemocratic women\n\n\nRepublican women\n\n\n\n\n\n\n78\n\n\n26\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nThat being said, the 78 Democratic women represent about one-third of all Democrats in Congress. That\u2019s less representative of the population as a whole, which is roughly half female. But women make up only 9 percent of Republicans in Congress.\nRacial diversity\nThe contrast is even greater for racial diversity. Democrats have nearly six times more minority members than the Republicans.\n\n\n\n\nMinority*\n\n\nDemocrats\n\n\nRepublicans\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfrican-American\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin Nunes\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in an interview on Fox\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRepublicans have no way to communicate\u201d after tech companies cut off Parler.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Amy Sherman \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n48\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\nHispanic/Latino\n\n\n30\n\n\n13\n\n\n\n\nAsian/Indian/Pacific Islander\n\n\n16\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n94\n\n\n16\n\n\n\n\n*Some members are counted in more than one category\nThe 94 Democrats who are minorities comprise 39 percent of all Democrats in Congress. That\u2019s as representative as the 38 percent of the U.S. population that is nonwhite Hispanic and other racial minorities. The 16 minority Republicans represent only 5.5 percent of all GOP members.\nWhite men over 55\nThe Congressional Research Service report does not provide a breakdown to check the third part of Pocan\u2019s claim -- that Republicans in Congress are dominated by white men over age 55.\nBut LegiStorm, a company that researches Congress, provides a close approximation. Its data shows that two-thirds of the Republican members of Congress (compared to about 40 percent of Democrats) are white males age 50 and over.\nTwo parting notes from analyses done by the nonprofit Pew Research Center, which show women and minorities making gains in Congress as a whole:\n\n\nGender: The share of women in Congress has reached an all-time high: Women now hold 104 seats, or 19 percent.\n\n\n\n\nRace: Congress remains disproportionately white when compared with the U.S. population, but is becoming more representative: Minorities account for 20 of 59 (34 percent) of the new members elected in November 2016.\n\n\nOur rating\nPocan said: In Congress, \"on the Democratic side of the room, you\u2019ve got men and women of all different races; on the other side, you\u2019ve got a bunch of white men in dark suits, all over 55 or so.\"\nDemocrats have several times more women and several times more minorities than Republicans do in the House and Senate combined. And older white males are much more predominant among Republicans. At the same time, fully one-third of GOP members are not while males over 50.\nFor a statement that is accurate but needs additional information, our rating is Mostly True.\n Share the Facts 2017-04-28 17:29:55 UTC   Politifact    2 1 7  Politifact Rating: Mostly True  In Congress, \"on the Democratic side of the room, you\u2019ve got men and women of all different races; on the other side, you\u2019ve got a bunch of white men in dark suits, all over 55 or so.\"    Mark Pocan U.S. representative, D-Wis.
