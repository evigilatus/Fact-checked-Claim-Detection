(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nSoros is a hedge fund manager and philanthropist. He has donated $18 billion to his philanthropic organization, Open Society Foundations, for initiatives to support universities, promote democracy, and reduce poverty. He also regularly donates to Democratic campaigns in the United States.\nLately, Soros has focused on changing the justice system by donating to local district attorney candidates who pledge to act tougher on police brutality cases and be more aware of racial issues in policing.\nThe Right Wing News post frames this as the grounds for Soros\u2019s arrest. But who intercepted the money? What was the crime? We decided to investigate.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHogan Gidley\n\n\nstated on January 17, 2021 in a Fox News interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump \u201ccan\u2019t say anything (about the U.S. Capitol riot) because the platforms have removed him.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 18, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnticlimactic Clickbait\nThe headline of this article, which states that the money was intercepted and that Soros could be headed to jail, is widely unsupported by evidence. It is also unsupported by the article itself, which never explains or even mentions legal action being brought against Soros.\nInstead, the article on Right Wing News focuses on Soros\u2019s involvement in district attorney elections in California. The author cites entire paragraphs from Fox News and the Los Angeles Times, two outlets that have reported on Soros\u2019s election donations. Neither mention any legal action, and a Nexis search did not find any other articles about about arresting Soros. This part of the headline appears to be entirely false, and merely meant to entice readers to click.\nIt is true that Soros and other liberal groups have donated huge sums of money to candidates who want to crack down on police brutality. However, a Los Angeles Times graphic shows that Soros donated about $19 million to 21 prosecutor campaigns across the country since 2014. In California, he has spent $2.7 million.\nThis is a far cry from $1.8 billion spent on four campaigns in California, as Right Wing News claimed. The headline\u2019s claim that this money was intercepted by someone was also unsupported by the body of the post and any other sources.\nOur ruling\nRight Wing News repurposed existing news articles about district attorney elections in California to make it appear that George Soros had donated 100 times more money than he had. The website then headlined this article with two baseless claims: that Soros\u2019s donations had been intercepted, and that he was likely to go to prison.\nSoros is not in legal trouble for his donations to district attorney campaigns, has only donated $2.7 million in California, and none of his money was intercepted by a third party.\nDue to a completely fabricated headline and incorrect numbers, we rate this claim Pants on Fire!\nUPDATE (July 16, 2018): After we published our fact-check, Right Wing News contacted us to say that the story was an opinion piece and that the headline included an error. Right Wing News adjusted the headline to say, \"OPINION: $1.8 Million Of Soros\u2019 Money Just Intercepted \u2013 He Should Officially Go To Prison For Years.\"", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01858"}
