Cutting did not result in economic growth. What results in growth is making sure you've got a good business climate for businesses to grow and prosper. And so we've got to cut where we can in order to invest where we must in order to grow the economy. And it's that investment side that I worry that those who are affiliated with the tea party or who are on the far right don't realize that other countries are co-investing with businesses in order to create jobs in their countries.\n\n\"If we do nothing more than just cut,\" she continued, \"that will continue to accelerate the lack of growth in (gross domestic product). So we've got to realize that the strategy here must be very specific. Yes, you've got to reform entitlements, but you've got reform entitlements and invest in order to grow because the quickest way to take down your deficit is through growth.\"\n\nWe wondered about three elements of Granholm\u2019s comments: whether she \"cut more as a percentage out of government than any state in the country this past decade,\" how poor Michigan\u2019s economic growth has been over the same period and whether spending cuts to state government hampered economic growth. (Separately, we\u2019re looking at a comment from the same show by Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, in which he accused Granholm of supporting \"the highest tax increases in the history of Michigan,\" which helped push unemployment \"from 6.8 percent to 15.3 percent.)\n\nWe\u2019ll take up the three claims in order.\n\nDid Michigan cut more from its government than any state in the country?\n\nTo answer this question, we turned to The Fiscal Survey of States, a twice-annual publication of the National Association of State Budget Officers that offers fiscal data for the 50 states going back to 1979.\n\nWe determined that the most appropriate data to use were figures for annual expenditures from the 50 states\u2019 general funds. We\u2019ll acknowledge up front that this is not the only measure that could be used to compare how much state governments have been cut. In fact, Michigan\u2019s state revenues flow into two accounts, the general fund and the school-aid fund, and the numbers we looked at only take into account the general fund. However, fiscal experts told us that the general fund offers a reasonable yardstick for state spending, and it also turned out to be the same measurement Granholm used, according to a spokeswoman. (Then there\u2019s the eternal statistician\u2019s lament: When comparing all 50 states across a period of nearly a decade, you take the statistics you can get.)\n\nWe calculated the change in general fund expenditures for all 50 states between fiscal year 2003 and fiscal year 2010 -- the closest approximation we could get to the start and end dates of Granholm\u2019s tenure.\n\nAnd by this measure, Granholm is right. Every state but two saw their general-fund expenditures increase over that period (without taking inflation into account). The two that didn\u2019t? Georgia, which saw its general fund expenditures fall by $54 million over that period, and Michigan, which saw its general fund expenditures fall by more than $1 billion. If they\u2019d been adjusted for inflation, the decrease would be even more severe.\n\nUsing another measure, Carole Polan, a spokeswoman for Granholm, added that from 2000 to 2008, the number of state employees fell by about 11,000 -- a 17 percent decline. That was a more rapid decline than in private employment, which fell in the state by 12 percent over the same period, Polan said.\n\nWe\u2019ll address the causes of these declines in a moment, but for now, we can say that by this measure, Granholm is right that spending on government declined faster in Michigan than in any other state between 2003 and 2010.\n\nHow poor was Michigan\u2019s economic growth during Granholm\u2019s tenure?\n\nTo answer this question, we looked at gross domestic product data for Michigan as published by the U.S. Commerce Department\u2019s Bureau of Economic Analysis. (Just as the bureau calculates the national gross domestic product, it does the same for individual states.) Once again, we compared Michigan\u2019s GDP for 2003 and 2010.\n\nBy this measure too, Michigan performed worst in the nation. Its gross domestic product rose by 6 percent over that period (again, not adjusted for inflation). That may sound okay, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s only about one-third the rate of the next worst-performing state -- Ohio, at 17 percent growth. And it\u2019s less than one-fifth of the increase of the nation as a whole, which was 31 percent.\n\nSo where economic growth is concerned, Granholm is right again: Michigan\u2019s performance during her tenure was uniquely poor among the 50 states.\n\nDid spending cuts to state government hamper Michigan\u2019s economic growth?\n\nThe cuts to government almost certainly hampered Michigan\u2019s economy. But experts say that they weren\u2019t the primary cause of the state\u2019s poor economic performance.\n\nLong-term troubles in the automotive industry, the national recession and raising taxes on businesses and individuals \"were all partially to blame,\" said Patrick L. Anderson, an economic analyst in East Lansing, Mich., who wrote a report released by Granholm's successor elected in 2010, Republican Rick Snyder.\n\nCharles Ballard, an economist at Michigan State University and author of Michigan's Economic Future: A New Look, added that even before the national economic crisis of 2008, \"the auto industry limped along for much of the decade, with General Motors, Ford and Chrysler losing market share steadily. In Michigan, we don\u2019t have Honda plants -- we have GM, Ford and Chrysler plants. Two of those companies went into bankruptcy. For better or for worse, we are home to the portions of the industry that did the worst.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Ballard added that Michigan\u2019s tax structure -- which doesn\u2019t tax most services or Internet sales and mail-order -- exacerbated the fiscal impact of these economic problems.\n\nIf the sectors that aren\u2019t taxed are growing faster than those that are, \"the sales tax applies to an ever-shrinking portion of the economy,\" Ballard said. \"So if you put the tax law on autopilot, the portion of your economy going to tax revenues shrinks every year.\"\n\nIn fact, \"Michigan\u2019s revenues peaked in 2000 and are not projected to return to peak until 2020,\" said Arturo Perez, a state budget analyst with the National Conference of State Legislatures. \"No other state has had a similar revenue situation.\"\n\nGiven this backdrop, a more appropriate way of thinking about it is that a poor economy in Michigan caused a drop in state tax revenue, which in turn forced Granholm to cut government services -- not the other way around. Declining tax revenue is a much more urgent factor for state governments than for the federal government, since most states are constrained from using deficit spending. (Michigan is one, though \"unavoidable deficits\" may be resolved in the next fiscal year.) This means that tax revenues play a more direct role in determining spending levels than they do at the federal level.\n\n\"The plain fact is that state economic growth rates are in the short run linked to the demand for products that are produced in the state -- products like autos in Michigan, oil in Texas, sunny vacations in Florida and gambling holidays in Nevada,\" said Gary Burtless, an economist with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution. \"Demand for these products can have booms and busts that are completely unrelated to a state\u2019s typical tax rate or spending level. In the short run, when demand for a state\u2019s products plummets, its state tax revenues fall, forcing the state to trim state spending or increase state tax rates.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.
