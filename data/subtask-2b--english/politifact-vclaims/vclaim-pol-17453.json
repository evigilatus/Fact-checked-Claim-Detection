The post includes an image of what looks like a typed notice from the Triangle Park Neighborhood Association.\n\"Be warned, there is a group going to homes and pretending to be officials from home affairs,\" the post reads. \"They have documents with the letterhead Department of Home Affairs and claim to be confirming that everyone has a valid ID for the upcoming census. They are robbing homes.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It has been shared hundreds of times in several different groups.\n\n(Screenshot from Facebook)\nBut the post isn\u2019t original \u2014 it\u2019s adapted from an old warning issued by South African officials.\nIn October 2017, the South Africa Department of Home Affairs published a warning about groups posing as election officials that were going door to door pretending to check IDs. Once the groups entered people\u2019s homes, they would rob them.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn April 2019, the department tweeted a similar statement. The phrasing is almost identical to the Facebook post.\n#SecurityAlert!!!! pic.twitter.com/JoTamy7K1E\u2014 HomeAffairsSA (@HomeAffairsSA) April 3, 2019 \nIn South Africa, the Department of Home Affairs is responsible for immigration and civic services, such as travel documents and citizenship records. There is no such department in the United States. Additionally, the Triangle Park Neighborhood Association is in the Greenville neighborhood of Jersey City, N.J.,\u00a0not Connecticut.\u00a0\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, there are three ways the agency conducts its decennial count: online, by phone and by mail. By April 1, all Americans should receive an invitation to participate in the survey. If the agency doesn\u2019t hear back by May, it will start following up with households in person.\nThe Census Bureau has debunked the \"Home Affairs\" hoax. While the agency does have employees in neighborhoods across the country, the census takers do not ask residents for identification. They are focused on whether the address is correct. They also carry badges and briefcases that indicate they work for the Census Bureau.\nDifferent versions of the Facebook hoax have been circulating online for several years. It\u2019s an example of a \"zombie claim\" \u2014\u00a0a falsehood that never dies.\nWe found similar posts in community groups in New York, Tennessee, Illinois and South Carolina, as well as India, the U.S. Virgin Islands and the United Kingdom. News outlets spanning from Texas to Malaysia have debunked it.\nThe Facebook post is inaccurate. We rate it False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17453"}
