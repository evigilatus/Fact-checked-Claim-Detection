Now, conspiracy theorists are mistakenly speculating that she was killed for writing a story critical of the FBI. On 13 December 2018, the Federation published a seven-point story of Bree Peyton writing about an 11-page report from the Inspector General &apos; s Office to investigate text messages exchanged between two FBI officials. \"The Ministry of Justice surveyed text messages between former FBI officials Lisa Paige and Peter Struzk from their cell phones before the IGO could review them, a new report from the DOJ observer reveals,\" Peyton wrote. \"Baige and Struzk's involvement with private lawyer Robert Mueller was thoroughly scrutinized after it was revealed that they sent several texts against Trump back and forth to each other.\" About two weeks later, the Federation published another story, telling this story about Peyton's death. Some bloggers took over the news. \"The reporter who published a story about Mueller's destruction of the text messages found dead!\" Read an article in Facebook accompanying a photo of Peyton on 31 December. This story was highlighted as part of Facebook &apos; s efforts to combat false news and misleading information in the broadcast of the news. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Some comments on the position are consistent with the suggestion that Peyton was killed because of her report. One Facebook user wrote: \"You go against Clinton, or you give information about criminal activity from Democrats and you risk your life.\" \"Many whistleblowers have died mysteriously.\" Another user linked to the January 3 blog was published on LewRockwell.com, a self-described repository of thinking \"against the state,\" \"against the war,\" and \"in favour of the market.\" There, Richard Innocent's story of Peyton's death says: \"I have no \"conclusive evidence\" of the idea that Peyton was killed because it would have revealed some kind of sensitive information against the deep State; but it must be said that the cause and circumstance of her death are distorted enough to be thought of.\" Other users did not buy them. One of them published a link to the death of December 30 in The New York Times, saying that Peyton had \"H1N1 flu, also known as swine flu, and brain infection, according to her family.\" Earlier in December, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that influenza activity was high throughout the country. By December 21, 7 child deaths associated with influenza had been reported. The New York Times mentions a tweet from a friend named Morgan Mortag who had asked Peyton to stay with her for Christmas. \"Four hours ago I found my friend unconscious and called 911,\" he tweeted Murtaugh in December 28, before Peyton died. \"She's been in a coma ever since and she really needs a miracle now. Please, if you are religious at all, send prayer this way. We really need it.\" In January 3, Murtaugh Tweed, the capital, McAllister, returned one of the shareholders to the Federation, among others. McAllister wrote: \"People who say that Bree Peyton was killed by P.S. \"We mourn her death and do not need this nonsense. I have reported on what has already been reported in the report of the Inspector General &apos; s Office. There's no reason to kill. She died of a disease.\" We're assessing this allegation pants on fire!
