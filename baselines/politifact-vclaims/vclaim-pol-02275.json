Evan Jenkins, R-W.Va., is seeking targeted funding for states grappling with opioid addiction.\nJenkins co-sponsored the Federal Opioid Response Fairness Act with Democratic Rep. Annie Kuster of New Hampshire and several other lawmakers, including fellow West Virginia Republican Rep. David McKinley.\nThe legislation, which awaits action in a House committee, would clarify that per capita overdose deaths should be a factor in distributing funding from the 21st Century Cures Act, a law passed in 2016 by overwhelming majorities in Congress and then signed into law by President Barack Obama.\nIn a March 20, 2018, press release to promote the bill, Jenkins wrote, \"The federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration announced on Monday that West Virginia will be receiving $330,000 in additional funding, as our state has the highest overdose death rate in the nation.\"\nIs Jenkins correct that West Virginia has \"the highest overdose death rate in the nation\"? Yes, according to official statistics from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nFor the most recent full year for which data is available, 2016, the CDC reported that West Virginia had the highest death rate due to drug overdoses. Here\u2019s a list of the top five states, which also include Kuster\u2019s home state of New Hampshire.\n\n\n\n\nState\n\n\nDrug overdose death rate, per 100,000 residents\n\n\n\n\nWest Virginia\n\n\n52.0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyan Fournier\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in a Tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Biden administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Noah Y.

The winner will challenge the state\u2019s Democratic senator, Joe Manchin.\nOur ruling\nJenkins said that West Virginia \"has the highest overdose death rate in the nation.\" That is accurate according to official federal data -- in fact, the comparison is not even close.
