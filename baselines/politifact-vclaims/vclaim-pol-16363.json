He criticized fellow Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton's candidacy, arguing that he represents a more dramatic distinction with John McCain, the apparent Republican frontrunner after winning Florida's primary.\n\nIn making his argument, Obama attacked Clinton for voting with Republicans on national security issues, among other things.\n\n\nAfter naming a number of areas where he said Clinton and McCain had the same positions, Obama attacked Clinton for diverging from McCain on the issue of torture. Clinton \"actually differed with him by arguing for exceptions for torture before changing positions when the politics of the moment changed,\" Obama said.\n\n\nIt sounds a little convoluted, so here's the step-by-step.\n\n\nIn October 2006, Clinton spoke about exceptions to a no-torture policy when speaking to the\n\nNew York Daily News.\n\nClinton mentioned a \"ticking time bomb\" scenario in which a captured terrorist has knowledge of an imminent terror attack and interrogators want to use torture.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In the event we were ever confronted with having to interrogate a detainee with knowledge of an imminent threat to millions of Americans, then the decision to depart from standard international practices must be made by the president, and the president must be held accountable,\" she said.\n\"That very, very narrow exception within very, very limited circumstances is better than blasting a big hole in our entire law.\"\n\n\nThen, on Sept. 26, 2007, Clinton said something different. During a debate, Tim Russert asked her about the ticking bomb scenario and here's what she said: \"As a matter of policy, it cannot be American policy, period.\" She said she met with military generals who told her there is \"very little evidence that it works.\"\n\n\nIn the days after the debate, the Republican National Committee criticized her for flip-flopping, and Obama said he would oppose torture \"without exception or equivocation,\" according to\n\nDaily News\n\nreports.\n\n\nDid Clinton change position because of her talks with the generals or because of the \"politics of the moment\"? We can't see inside Clinton's head, so our ruling doesn't reflect on that part of the statement. But it is clear she changed her mind about the \"ticking bomb\" scenario. So we rate Obama's claim True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16363"}
