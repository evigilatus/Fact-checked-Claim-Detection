Bryan Hughes of Mineola had slanderously charged Simpson with supporting licenses for illegal immigrants without delivering the factual goods.\nSimpson further declared: \"I have always opposed driver\u2019s licenses for illegal aliens.\"\nWe wondered.\nSome perspective: The Texas Department of Public Safety began requiring license applicants to produce government-issued documents affirming their legal residency status in 2008, and lawmakers voted to require as much in a 2011 special session. Before 2008, according to a July 2011 Texas Tribune\u00a0news story, no proof of legal residency was required to obtain a Texas license or state identification card.\nThe spat between Hughes and Simpson developed, we suspect, because Republicans who show weakness on illegal immigration can run into trouble, especially in a party primary. The two are both angling to succeed Kevin Eltife, R-Tyler, representing the Senate\u2019s District 1.\nWe can\u2019t gauge how someone has always felt about an issue. So we limited our scope to signs of Simpson publicly opposing licenses for such immigrants--finding that while there\u2019s room for contrary speculation, a little of it caused by his own ambiguous statement, Simpson was among the vast bulk of House members who voted for the 2011 Legislature\u2019s mandate to the DPS, arguably a sign he wasn\u2019t intent on ensuring that all residents access licenses.\nNews stories\nLet\u2019s start with what Simpson has said in public settings.\nHughes\u2019 campaign pointed out a July 21, 2014, Tyler Morning Telegraph\u00a0news story\u00a0quoting Simpson after he returned from a weeklong tour of the Rio Grande Valley. \"We do have a problem with drugs and warlords taking advantage of the situation,\" Simpson said. \"We have to require a fulfillment of promises to appear before immigration courts to enter schools. We need to determine the status of these immigrants and not put them in this limbo. They can get an education but not get a driver\u2019s license. That\u2019s not right.\"\nWhat wasn\u2019t right in Simpson\u2019s view wasn\u2019t entirely clarified. The story further quoted him saying: \"We do need to secure the border against crime and terror, in order to defend life, liberty and property. I welcome people to come. We need workers. We do need to limit our health care to emergencies and critical care to immigrants as well as citizens. What\u2019s going on in emergency rooms is not right. We need to stop the freebies, and open the legal pipeline while continuing to secure the border.\"\nTo our inquiry about Simpson\u2019s consistency, Luke Macias, a consultant to Simpson\u2019s campaign, guided us to Simpson\u2019s 2014 98-slide\u00a0presentation\u00a0based on the legislator\u2019s border trip, which included\u00a0photos of his travels and thoughts about border and immigration policy.\nMacias urged us to note\u00a0the slide indicating Simpson thinks Texas should \"overturn the mandate to educate aliens who have entered the country illegally or who are still residents of Mexico.\" A\u00a01982 U.S. Supreme Court decision, in Plyler v. Doe, required Texas not to deny public education to \"undocumented school-age children.\"\nAnother Simpson slide, titled \"Dysfunctional Policies,\" including this license line: \"We provide K-12 education, but students cannot receive a driver\u2019s license:\"\n\nSOURCE:\u00a0Presentation,\u00a0\"A Sobering and Beautiful Week on the Rio Grande,\"\u00a0David Simpson, June 30-July 6, 2014 (web link received by email from Luke Macias, general consultant, David Simpson Texas Senate campaign, Dec. 1, 2015)\nWhat gives? By phone, Simpson\u00a0told us he was trying to stress his continuing belief in not giving \"handouts and privileges\" to immigrants living here without permission; those include driver\u2019s licenses, he said. By email, Simpson noted accurately that while his presentation called for some changes--such as ending the public schooling of children in the country illegally--it \"did not advocate for giving driver\u2019s licenses to illegals.\"\nOur searches via the Nexis news database and through news stories published by the Longview\u00a0News-Journal\u00a0yielded no examples of Simpson previously offering an opinion on driver\u2019s licenses for\u00a0immigrants.\nSimpson\u2019s legislative record\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we took up Simpson\u2019s legislative record.\nIn summer 2011, lawmakers moved to require the DPS to seek proof of legal residency from applicants for driver\u2019s licenses by placing\u00a0an amendment on a fiscal matters measure. At the time, the move was pitched as bringing Texas into compliance with the federal REAL ID Act, which says applicants for a driver's license must prove legal residency if they want to use the identification to get through airport security. See the agency's explanation here.\nAnd on June 9, 2011, nearly all House members (including Simpson) approved the amendment to\u00a0Senate Bill 1. House video reveals no debate of the matter after Rep. Charles Geren, R-Fort Worth, told colleagues\u00a0the amendment\u00a0\"addresses an issue of people getting Texas driver\u2019s licenses that don\u2019t live in Texas and it also allows the department to issue a license only for the length of time that a person is entitled to be here.\"\u00a0According to the House Journal, eight members, Simpson not among them, asked to be recorded voting against the amendment.\nRecords show too that Simpson voted against the overall fiscal matters proposal several times; the votes occurred on\u00a0June 9,\u00a0June 10\u00a0and\u00a0June 28, 2011. By email, Simpsons told us he opposed the measure \"due to its accounting gimmicks\u2014namely, the deferment of Foundation School Program payments and the speed-up of tax payments\u2014and its misplaced priorities, not because of the license provision, which I supported.\" He provided a copy of a\u00a0May 2012 letter\u00a0to constituents stating that he \"voted for the amendment to add documentation requirements for driver's licenses\" but against SB 1 because it extended inequitable school funding, sped tax collections and used \"smoke and mirrors\" to balance the state budget.\nSo, Simpson backed the mandate that DPS check on each applicant\u2019s legal residency.\nTwo years later, though, Simpson cast a vote at least\u00a0leaving room for speculation about his consistency on this front.\nThat year, he voted against successful House efforts effectively killing proposals that related to more residents possibly getting driving permits. We know of no independent way of telling if those votes signaled a position on driver\u2019s licenses.\nBut on May 20, 2013, Simpson voted in favor of one of the failed amendments, the\u00a0Texas House Journal\u00a0shows. The amendment to Senate Bill 1729 by Rep. Byron Cook, R-Corsicana, said that under the legislation, which otherwise authorized a pilot project enabling a few counties to update or renew driver\u2019s licenses, a license should include \"any Texas resident driver\u2019s permit authorized by law.\"\nAnd what did that mean? In debate, opponents said Cook\u2019s language related to unauthorized residents getting a driver\u2019s permit. Similarly, Simpson and Hughes\u2019 campaign each nudged, conservative advocacy groups characterized the amendment as opening driver\u2019s licenses to ineligible individuals. In a\u00a0scorecard of the 2013 Legislature, for instance, the Young Conservatives of Texas said Cook\u2019s amendment \"would have allowed for illegal immigrants to receive driver\u2019s licenses.\"\nWe didn\u2019t reach that conclusion--and by email, Simpson told us Cook\u2019s amendment \"in no way authorized illegal aliens to receive driver\u2019s licenses.\" Asked why he voted for it, Simpson said: \"I voted yes to the amendment because it would only include licenses or permits already\" authorized by law.\nIn debate, Cook didn\u2019t dispute that his proposal might legalize more drivers; he also stressed that another change in law would be needed for the envisioned permits to become a reality. Cook\u2019s proposal drew 72 votes, with 67 members voting no, but it died because Cook offered the proposal during final consideration of SB 1729; at that stage, 100 House votes were needed to amend legislation.\nA few days earlier, on May 17, 2013, Cook rolled out a longer amendment to SB 1729. He described the proposal--which was shortly derailed on a parliamentary point of order without members (including Simpson) voting on it--as identical to a committee-approved version of\u00a0House Bill 3206\u00a0by Rep. Roberto Alonzo, D-Dallas.\nAlonzo\u2019s amended plan called for state-issued driving permits for residents who lack proof of legal residency, also requiring recipients to obtain auto insurance. Under the proposal, every applicant would have to submit to fingerprinting and clear a criminal background check before qualifying for a permit.\nThe same month, Hughes\u2019 campaign noted, Simpson was on the losing end of an 87-60 House vote setting aside Alonzo\u2019s amendment to a\u00a0House measure\u00a0that authorized the state to let public schools and driving schools give the driving test required to get a license. Before that May 21, 2013, action, Alonzo told House colleagues that under his amendment, schools could give driving tests to individuals who obtained resident driving permits, provided such permits were legalized. \"Texas has a problem,\" Alonzo said, with people driving without auto insurance or a driver\u2019s permit.\nBy phone, Alonzo told us he favors giving undocumented individuals an opportunity to legally drive in Texas and his 2013 proposal\u2019s described permits could have nudged the state toward fulfilling the goal though, he said, it didn\u2019t provide for full-fledged licenses.\nFinally, we spotted no evidence of Simpson trying to legislate about driver\u2019s licenses. In the 2011 session, Simpson authored or co-authored about 50 measures, none touching on giving or denying licenses. In the 2013 and 2015 sessions, Simpson\u00a0authored or co-authored\u00a0nearly 150 measures, none of them affecting driver\u2019s licenses.\nOur ruling\nSimpson said he\u2019s always been opposed to illegal immigrants having driver\u2019s licenses\nIn 2011, Simpson joined House members in voting for the change in law requiring license applicants to document their legal residency, which we take as a strong indication of his position. But there\u2019s a hint of uncertainty in Simpson\u2019s 2013 vote on a proposal offered in favor of unauthorized residents someday getting resident driver permits as sought by Alonzo and others, which importantly didn\u2019t and don\u2019t exist, and his ambiguous 2014 remark about driver\u2019s licenses.\nWe rate this claim Mostly True.\n\nMOSTLY TRUE\u00a0\u2013 The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.\nClick here for\u00a0more\u00a0on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05627"}
