Bush, anxiety over Y2K had passed, unemployment was at 4 percent and the federal budget showed a surplus.\n\nMuch credit for the latter was claimed by a Republican congressman named John Kasich, chairman of the House Budget Committee. Now Ohio's governor, he was bringing his last budget resolution to the floor -- and, touching on a topic raised frequently in more than 14 hours of debate, promising a prescription drug plan for seniors by the end of the year.\n\nAccording to the Kaptur campaign, Kucinich voted against the prescription drug plan offered by conservative Democrats in their alternative budget proposal, the Stenholm Amendment, at a time \"when there was no alternative with a chance.\"\n\nKucinich voted for another Democratic plan that failed. He would have considered the Stenholm plan a \"halfway measure,\" Kaptur's campaign spokesman said -- \"He wanted the perfect, not the good.\"\n\nKucinich's campaign answered that he voted against the Stenholm Amendment advanced by \"Blue Dog\" Democrats \"because it it also included about $4 billion more in military spending than even the Republicans had proposed.\n\n\"He supported and voted for the budget plan advanced by the Democratic leadership of the House, which included $40 billion over fiscal years 2001 through 2005 and $155 billion through fiscal year 2010 for a Medicare prescription drug benefit and premium and cost-sharing protections,\" Kucinich's campaign spokesman added. Kaptur, incidently, also voted for that plan.\n\nIn fact, the House considered and rejected five budget proposals before passing the resolution offered by Kasich, according to the Congressional Record's account of floor proceedings and the Congressional Research Service:\n\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Owens Amendment, advanced by the Congressional Black Caucus, was defeated by a vote of 70-348.\n\n\n\nThe DeFazio Amendment, offered by the Progressive Caucus, was defeated 61-351.\n\n\n\nThe Sununu Amendment, representing the Republican Conservative Action Team, was defeated 78-339.\n\n\n\nThe Stenholm Amendment, from \"Blue Dog\" Democrats, \"sought to retire the public debt by 2012; provide investments in education, veterans, health care and defense; and establish a $40 billion Medicare reserve fund that can be used for Medicare reform and a prescription drug benefit,\" according to the CRS summary. It was defeated 171-243. Kaptur voted yes; Kucinich voted no.\n\n\n\nThe Spratt Amendment, advanced by party leadership, \"sought to pay down the public debt, provide targeted tax relief to working families, retain 100 percent of the Social Security surplus, and provide funding for a Medicare prescription drug coverage,\" according to the CRS. It was defeated 184-233. Both Kucinich and Kaptur voted yes.\n\n\n\n\nBoth voted against the budget resolution advanced by Kasich, which passed 211-207.\n\nThat brings us back to the claim in the ad: \"When Kaptur fought for the Democrats' prescription drug benefit for seniors, Kucinich voted no.\"\n\nWe think that claim isn\u2019t accurate on a number of counts.\n\nKucinich did in fact vote no when Kaptur voted yes on one budget proposal. But labeling that proposal as \"the Democrats\u2019 prescription drug benefit for seniors\" is inaccurate. It was one of four Democratic proposals and not leadership\u2019s plan (which Kucinich and Kaptor both supported. \u00a0\n\nIt is misleading to imply that Kucinich\u2019s no vote was a vote against a prescription benefit. His vote came on a resolution encompassing the entire $1.8 trillion federal budget that contained, among many things, the prescription benefit Kaptur\u2019s ad cites..\n\nUltimately, a dozen years later, the question of whether the plan Kaptur\u2019s ad touts was better is moot. The Spratt Amendment supported by both Kucinich and Kaptur actually won more votes than the Blue Dog proposal that Kaptur backed but Kucinich opposed, but neither was going to win passage \u00a0from the House's Republican majority.\n\nWe rate Kaptur\u2019s ad claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11490"}
