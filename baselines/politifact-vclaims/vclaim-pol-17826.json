Some apply to specific settings, such as stores or government-owned buildings, others more universally, such as in Dane County and the cities of Milwaukee and Green Bay.\u00a0\nIndeed, on\u00a0July 30, 2020,\u00a0Gov. Tony Evers issued a statewide mask order.\nMost mask mandates have come with exceptions, such as for young children and people whose medical conditions may make it unsafe to wear one.\u00a0\nOpponents argue mask mandates endanger personal freedoms, that wearing a mask can cause carbon dioxide poisoning (an idea that has been\u00a0debunked\u00a0by scientists) and that some types of face coverings won\u2019t do anything to stop transmission of the coronavirus.\u00a0\nState Rep. Michael Schraa, R-Oshkosh, voiced that theory in an\u00a0interview with the Oshkosh Northwestern\u00a0on July 24, 2020, after sharing links to sources on Facebook that suggest masks do not work as they are intended. His comments come as the city of Oshkosh weighs a mandate on masks in public spaces.\u00a0\n\"If you think the government should be mandating us wearing masks that are proven ineffective just for the sake of giving a false sense of security for people, what else are you going to agree to?\" Schraa told the Northwestern.\u00a0\nIs Schraa correct when he claims that wearing masks has been \"proven ineffective\"?\nNo.\u00a0\nLet\u2019s take a look.\nNew guidance to match a new virus\u00a0\nWhen asked for backup, spokeswoman Linda Palmer said the comment was aimed at whether governments should be allowed to mandate masks, and that \"he did not make a direct statement that all masks are always totally ineffective.\"\u00a0\nBut Schraa did say \u2014 here and in other forums \u2014 that he believed masks weren\u2019t effective. In conversations on his Facebook page, he linked to articles stating that masks do not prevent transmission of viruses.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s important to note that, at one point, federal health officials were not recommending that everyone wear masks, although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0began advising widespread mask use in April\u00a0and hasn\u2019t changed its stance since.\u00a0\nCritics often use that reversal to argue against the effectiveness of masks.\u00a0\nBut because this is a novel virus, the CDC, the medical community and everyday Americans alike are learning about it at the same time \u2014 and as more evidence emerged about how many asymptomatic people could be spreading the virus, guidance on who should wear masks shifted with it.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(The CDC now estimates that\u00a040% of infections\u00a0could be among people who feel perfectly healthy.)\nDo masks protect others from you?\u00a0\nIf you\u2019re not a health care worker, you\u2019re likely wearing a cloth mask instead of an N95 respirator, which filters the large majority of airborne particles and thus protects the wearer and the people around them.\u00a0\nThe role of the cloth mask is largely that of source control \u2014 that is, to prevent you from transmitting the virus to others if you are infected.\u00a0\nA growing body of evidence supports the idea that a cloth face covering will cut down on COVID-19 transmission. This includes:\u00a0\n\n\nA review of 172 studies worldwide from the\u00a0medical journal The Lancet\u00a0found that face mask use could result in \"a large reduction\" in risk of infection\n\n\nA\u00a0study of Mass General Brigham, the largest health care system in Massachusetts, found that rates of positivity among workers dropped after a universal mask policy was implemented\u00a0\n\n\nResearchers at Texas A&M University\u00a0compared trends in China, Italy and New York City and found that wearing a face mask reduced the number of infections by tens of thousands in Italy and New York\n\n\nA laboratory study\u00a0that visualized droplets with laser lighting as people spoke found that the trajectory of the droplets nearly disappeared when the person wore a face covering\u00a0\n\n\nA\u00a0CDC study\u00a0that found two Missouri hairdressers who wore masks while working with clients and diagnosed with COVID-19 shortly after did not pass the virus on to any of the clients who had been exposed\u00a0\n\n\nWhat about the other way around? Do masks protect you from others? For cloth mask wearers, research is less clear on this front, but evidence is growing here, too.\u00a0\nFor example, a\u00a0new paper\u00a0led by a professor at the University of California, San Francisco and set to be published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine asserts that people wearing a mask will take in fewer coronavirus particles, making it easier for their immune systems to seek out and stamp out the ones that do get in.\u00a0\nAs evidence about masks reducing infections has grown, leaders who previously decried their use have now shifted their tone. In Texas, for example, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott\u00a0instituted a statewide mask mandate\u00a0as cases spiked after previously resisting such an order. Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, a Republican,\u00a0issued a similar mandate\u00a0in July, after saying in May that a statewide order wouldn\u2019t work. And President Donald Trump, another Republican,\u00a0endorsed masks\u00a0on July 21 after months of critiquing their use.\nThe sources Schraa has linked to in online conversations about mask usage include stories from SOTT.net, which has landed on a\u00a0list of sites\u00a0found to be publishing misinformation about the coronavirus, and a video featuring an Infowars host on the website banned.video.\u00a0\nThe sources that back up claims of mask effectiveness, stem from large research universities, prominent labs and medical journals, and the CDC.\u00a0\nOur rating\u00a0\nIn a critique of local governments\u2019 ability to require people to wear masks, Schraa said that masks are \"proven ineffective\" at cutting down transmission of the coronavirus.\u00a0\nBut a growing number of studies \u2014 and a growing consensus among leaders, including President Trump \u2014 have shown the opposite to be true.\nWe rate the claim False.\n\u00a0\nSee Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17826"}
