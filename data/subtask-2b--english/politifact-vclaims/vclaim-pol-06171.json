(Assuming, of course, that Earth could form so far from the sun, which is not realistic.)\nThe International Astronomical Union\u2019s decision\nAhead of Pluto\u2019s demotion almost a decade ago, astronomers had been wrestling over what to do with the icy, diminutive planet as other bodies in the Kuiper Belt and elsewhere came to focus, including an even bigger world called Xena (renamed Eris). Should those bodies also be planets, or are they, like Pluto, something else?\nIn 2006, the IAU came up with a resolution on how a planet ought to be defined. The IAU definition says a planet is a celestial body that meets the following criteria:\n\nis in orbit around the sun,\nhas a spherical or nearly round shape,\nhas cleared the neighborhood around its orbit.\n\nPluto passed the first two criteria, but it flunked the third about clearing the neighborhood around its orbit.\nWe wondered if Earth would also fail to clear its neighborhood if it switched places with Pluto. And what in the heck does \"clearing the neighborhood\" mean anyway?\nExperts told us to think of it like a planet taking a broom to its orbit.\n\" \u2018Clearing the neighborhood\u2019 is like sweeping up and tossing out an accumulation of debris once and for all, where no outside source replaces it,\" said Steven Soter, a resident research associate at the American Museum of Natural History, who also proposed a method of measuring the cleanliness of a planet\u2019s orbit.\nHowever, Soter says the IAU definition is misleading because no planet can ever entirely clear its neighborhood, as asteroids and comets often leak back into orbital zones from the outside, he said.\n\"The Earth even in its present location has not entirely \u2018cleared\u2019 its orbital zone,\" Soter said. \"Asteroids and comets clobber it every few million years.\"\nSoter would rewrite the definition to say that a body must \"dynamically dominate\" its orbital zone in order to be considered a planet. This loosened definition means a planet could keep its neighborhood relatively clear in spite of constant debris coming in from the outside.\nStill, Pluto would not pass the planet test even under this term, Soter said. Pluto only dominates its own satellite system, and it has no influence on the rest of the Kuiper Belt that can be seen.\nIf Earth were in Pluto\u2019s position, Soter said it would still be a planet \u2014 but only marginally \u2014 based on its neighborhood-clearing abilities.\nSoter pointed to this wonky-looking graph to explain his point.\n\n\nThe horizontal axis shows how far a planet is from the sun, while the vertical axis shows a planet\u2019s mass relative to Earth. Every diagonal line on the graph shows how good a planet is at keeping its neighborhood relatively clear despite debris floating back in.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome planets (the larger ones at the top, such as Jupiter and Saturn) clear out more debris, and others (Mercury, Mars, the ones straddling the topmost diagonal line) clear out less.\nThe farther a planet gets from the sun, the harder it is to keep its neighborhood clean. \u00a0Right now, Earth does pretty well for itself. But move our planet right from 1 AU to 40 AU (Pluto\u2019s location), and Earth is not as good as clearing its neighborhood.\nAgain, hypothetically speaking.\n\"The Earth in Pluto's orbit would have about the same dynamical power as Mercury or Mars, so it would (only) marginally dominate its new orbital zone,\" Soter said.\nSo, Earth would still be a planet, but it would be close, he said.\nThere is also another way of looking at this definition. Soter proposed a way of defining planets by looking at how significant a planet-like body is compared to other space debris in its zone. (Think of comparing the mass of the broom you\u2019re using to the mass of garbage still left behind.)\nWould Earth still be a significant object when compared to everything else in Pluto\u2019s neighborhood? Maybe. There is no way to predict and compare masses, he said.\nArguments that support the petition\nThe equation behind the graph was proposed by planetary scientists Harold Levison and Alan Stern, who is the lead investigator for the New Horizons mission to Pluto.\nStern\u2019s advocacy for Pluto being a planet is well-known, and he stressed in a phone interview that he has a very different take on this question than Soter. As he has said for years, Stern thinks Earth would not be able to clear Pluto\u2019s zone and therefore not be a planet under the IAU parameters.\nThe farther a planet (or planet-like body) is from the sun, the larger an object has to be to clear its orbital zone \u2014 which means Pluto, 4.67 billion miles from the sun, has it pretty rough out there.\n\"The Kuiper Belt zone (the zone Pluto has to clear) is bigger than the zones from Mercury to Neptune,\" Stern told PunditFact.\nMark V. Sykes, director of the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Ariz., agrees with Stern that Earth would no longer be considered a planet if it were in Pluto\u2019s location. Sykes went even further to suggest that Earth would no longer be a planet if it were placed between Jupiter and Saturn.\n\"The IAU definition is analogous to putting an apple in the middle of the table, then moving it to the edge of the table and declaring it is no longer an apple,\" he said.\nBoth Stern and Soter faulted a time crunch at the 2006 meeting that resulted in a rushed set of criteria for planethood. \u00a0When the IAU proposed its new definition, Stern said, it was done \"overnight\" and no specific calculations were used. One of the concerns among scientists there was that if Pluto were\u00a0admitted as a planet, then so would other space bodies. Some attendees worried there would be \"too many planets to memorize,\" Stern said.\nThe concerns were \"not scientific \u2026 (but) somewhere between personal preference and political,\" Stern wrote in the Space article.\nThere are also other concerns about the IAU\u2019s decision. Only about 16-25 percent of the registered astronomers at the IAU meeting voted on the definition. Other scientists have also pointed out that the IAU\u2019s definition is limited to our solar system and does not consider planets that might exist outside the solar system.\nWe reached out to a representative from IAU to comment but did not hear back.\nOur ruling\nOther Space's petition claims, \"By declaring that Pluto was no longer a planet, the (International Astronomical Union) put into place a planetary definition that would have even declassified Earth as a planet if it existed as far from the sun as Pluto does.\"\nPutting aside the fact that this could not actually happen, we heard very different opinions from scientists on whether the definition would really exclude Earth if it were in Pluto\u2019s shoes.\nPluto was demoted as a planet because it could not clear its orbital zone, a requirement established by the astronomers union. However, the IAU definition is ambiguous because no planet can ever completely clear its orbital zone. Absent a clearer definition, scientists disagree about whether Earth would be declassified in this far-fetched scenario, though it certainly would not do as good a job at \"clearing the neighborhood\" as it does now.\nThe claim on the petition is partially accurate but leaves out important details \u2014 the main one being that we\u2019ll never know for sure.
