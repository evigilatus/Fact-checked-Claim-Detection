We found the story about a senior stimulus after Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network\u2019s efforts to combat fake news.\nThe fake story says that to qualify for the stimulus, recipients must be over 65, retired, receive Social Security and have an income under $40,000 per year. \"The letter will also come with an offer to pledge support for President Trump, a requirement the Attorney General says is perfectly legal and patriotic, though not fully enforceable,\" stated the article.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe article then directed readers to call the White House switchboard if they don\u2019t receive the letter. (The number printed in the article and it is indeed the switchboard.)\nReaganwasright.com describes itself as a satirical website that uses \"humor, irony, exaggeration, OR ridicule to expose and criticize people\u2019s stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues.\"\nThe about us page links to the Facebook page of America\u2019s Last Line of Defense, which is run by Christopher Blair, a Maine man behind who we\u2019ve written about previously. Blair told us his websites are carefully curated social experiment designed to \"feed the Hoverounders their daily need for hate and their undying urge to blame everything in the known universe on Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.\"\nThey\u2019re also a vehicle to make money. The point, of course, is to get someone on Facebook to click on the post thinking it is real. \"I discovered that Facebook following plus blog plus ads equals income,\" Blair told us previously.\nIn this case, the Reaganwasright Facebook post includes an innocuous headline, \"President Trump just saved Christmas for 13 million retirees,\" and a caption that asks people to share the post 1,000 times to show appreciation for Trump. As of this writing, it had been shared 768 times.\n\n\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire.\n Share the Facts 2017-11-28 21:56:29 UTC   PolitiFact    1 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Pants on Fire  \"President Trump just saved Christmas for 13 million retirees.\"    Bloggers ReaganwasRight.com https://reaganwasright.com/2017/11/24/in-reality-hes-taking-all-of-your-money/   a Facebook post Friday, November 24, 2017 2017-11-24    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02652"}
