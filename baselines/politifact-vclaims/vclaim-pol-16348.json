Williams High School in Alexandria, Va., on Feb. 10, 2008, Barack Obama opened his speech by talking about how Americans are feeling squeezed by the price of college, health care and gasoline.\n\n\"They've never paid more for gas at the pump,\" he said.\n\n\nA month and a half ago, we found Obama was\n\ninaccurate\n\nfor a similar statement, but we thought we should take another look.\n\n\nA check of the latest numbers finds he is still wrong.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

If you adjust for inflation, the current national price is still 41 cents below the peak of $3.39 per gallon, set in March 1981.\n\n\nAnd so, we find his statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16348"}
