That's another 4.5 million people.\"\nKaine continued to say the Republican ticket has called for a deportation force and that they want to go \"house to house, school to school, business to business, and kick out 16 million people.\"\nPence said it was nonsense.\nSo we wanted to know: Has Trump proposed to deport 16 million people, and do the Republican candidates plan to \"get rid of\" birthright citizenship?\nKaine\u2019s tally of 16 million possibly deported by Trump includes people who are in the country illegally (about 11 million) and U.S. born children of undocumented parents (about 4.5 million, according to Pew Research Center).\nAs Trump began his pursuit of the Republican presidential nomination, he presented an immigration plan that called for an end to birthright citizenship, saying it is \"the biggest magnet for illegal immigration.\"\nThat was the old version of Trump\u2019s plan. Trump outlined his latest immigration plan a year later, on Aug. 31 in Arizona. His 10-point plan did not call for deporting 16 million people or ending birthright citizenship. He emphasized that he wanted to deport 2 million \"criminal aliens.\"\nTrump\u2019s \u2018deportation force\u2019 days\nKaine\u2019s comments aren\u2019t unfounded.\nTrump has not been consistent on immigration throughout his campaign.\nIn that same Arizona speech, Trump talked about the broader undocumented population having to leave first in order to come back: \"Those here illegally today, who are seeking legal status, they will have one route and one route only: To return home and apply for re-entry like everybody else.\"\nClinton\u2019s campaign pointed out a line in that speech where he said \"anyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation.\"\nLeading up to the primaries, Trump said he wanted undocumented families to stay together, but \"they have to go.\"\nIn a September 2015 interview on 60 Minutes, Scott Pelley asked Trump what he would do with 11 million immigrants in the United States illegally. \"If they've done well, they're going out and they're coming back in legally ... We're rounding 'em up in a very humane way, in a very nice way,\" Trump said.\nIn November 2015, a day after one of the Republican primary debates, Joe Scarborough of MSNBC asked Trump, \"How do you deport 12 million illegal immigrants?\"\n\"You do it. You do it. Because they're here illegally, you do it,\" Trump responded.\nIn that same interview, he said, \"you\u2019re going to have a deportation force, and you\u2019re going to do it humanely.\"\nBirthright citizenship\nSo Trump has talked extensively about deporting the undocumented population, some faster than others. But that doesn\u2019t mean he necessarily wants to deport their U.S.-born children.\nTrump hasn\u2019t talked about birthright citizenship and \"anchor babies\" much since the heyday of the GOP primary. In November, Trump said a constitutional amendment would not be needed to deal with the citizenship of children born in the United States to undocumented parents.\n\"You need an act of Congress. You don't have to go through a new amendment or anything, a new constitutional amendment,\" Trump said November 2015 in an MSNBC interview. \"But anchor babies. A woman is pregnant; she goes over to the border, has a baby on our land, now we take care of the baby for the next 85 years.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign did not respond to questions about his current position on birthright citizenship. Trump\u2019s call for an end to birthright citizenship is no longer prominently featured in the immigration reform section of Trump\u2019s campaign website, but a file of his first plan outlining it is still available.\nThe 14th Amendment established birthright citizenship, which says \"all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\"\nThat clause of the amendment is widely understood to mean that everyone born on U.S. soil is automatically an American citizen, despite parents\u2019 immigration status.\nPence, Trump\u2019s running mate, cosponsored the Birthright Citizenship Act of 2009, introduced in the House but never brought to any vote.\nThe bill sought to amend immigration law to consider a person born in the United States \"subject to the jurisdiction\" of the United States if the U.S.-born person has at least one parent who is a U.S. citizen or national; a lawful permanent resident living in the United States; or an immigrant performing active service in the U.S. Armed Forces. So that would have prevented U.S.-born children of two parents without lawful or military status from obtaining citizenship.\nIt is technically possible to end birthright citizenship for persons born in the United States to undocumented immigrants by repealing the 14th Amendment, said Daniel Costa, director of immigration law and policy research at the Economic Policy Institute.\nOtherwise, a measure like Pence\u2019s bill that is signed into law could be challenged all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court over 14th Amendment concerns.\nA big jump, plus legal concerns\nTo reach 16 million deportations, Kaine assumes the citizenship of 4.5 million people who were born on U.S. soil to parents in the country illegally would be retroactively taken away under Trump.\nTrump said several times in 2015 that\u00a0he does not think\u00a0citizenship should have been granted to\u00a0people with undocumented parents. But\u00a0he has not proposed to deport them all or outlined a plan to revoke\u00a0birthright citizenship that\u2019s already been granted.\u00a0\nThe Clinton campaign disagrees,\u00a0pointing\u00a0to an\u00a0August 2015 exchange between Trump and\u00a0Bill O'Reilly, who asked, \"Illegal immigrant mother and father living in Los Angeles, two children who are American citizens, born here.\u00a0 If you're president do you order authorities to take that family into custody?\"\nTrump answered,\u00a0\"We have no choice.\u00a0I'm sorry, Bill.\u00a0We have to bring them out.\"\nTrump's\u00a0responses to\u00a0similar questions were also\u00a0vague.\u00a0In another August 2015 interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo,\u00a0he said undocumented\u00a0parents would have to leave and unless they were \"bad\" parents they would take their baby with citizenship with them.\nAgain, that wasn't a clear proposal\u00a0to deport 4.5 million people with citizenship.\u00a0Doing so would invite even more legal challenges than trying to remove or alter the 14th Amendment.\n\"Such a retroactive statute would clearly be far more controversial than merely changing the rules prospectively,\" said David A. Martin, an immigration, constitutional law and international law scholar and professor emeritus at the University of Virginia School of Law.\nAny retroactive stripping of citizenship to those born in the United States to undocumented parents would likely be challenged by the courts, Costa said, because \"they acquired citizenship under the longstanding interpretation of the law and the Constitution that was in effect at the time they acquired it.\"\nSuch a retroactive law would be considered an \"ex post facto\" law (which means making an act illegal even though it was legal when committed). Ex post facto laws, which generally apply to criminal penalties, are prohibited by the Constitution.\n\"I'm sure that it would be unconstitutional to change the birthright citizenship rule retroactively, probably as a violation of substantive due process,\" said Peter Schuck, an emeritus professor of law at Yale University.\nOur ruling\nKaine said, \"Donald Trump proposes to deport 16 million people. 11 million who are here without documents, and both Donald Trump and Mike Pence want to get rid of birthright citizenship.\"\nTrump has talked about the entire undocumented population of about 11 million people having to leave the country at some point in order to come back and reside legally. But Kaine assumes Trump would try to deport 4.5 million people who have citizenship because they were born in the country to undocumented parents.\u00a0Trump has said birthright citizenship under\u00a0the 14th Amendment is questionable but has not proposed\u00a0retroactively stripping it\u00a0away and deporting\u00a0this group.\nTrump did call\u00a0for an end to birthright citizenship during the primary. His most-recent immigration plan does not mention the idea, though he has not renounced it altogether.\u00a0As for\u00a0Pence, he\u00a0co-sponsored a bill seven years ago to amend birthright citizenship eligibility to children who have at least\u00a0one parent with legal or military status.\nKaine\u2019s statement is partially accurate, so we rate it Half True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c19c66d8-2ec0-41f0-9dad-df909ccbf357\nClarification: The fact-check\u00a0was\u00a0updated shortly after publication to account for more of\u00a0Trump's comments on birthright citizenship.
