Elizabeth Warren turned to the topic of high prescription drug prices.\n\"Last year, 36 million Americans didn\u2019t have a prescription filled because they couldn\u2019t afford it,\" the Massachusetts senator said.\u00a0\nDrug prices are a persistent hot-button issue, and one of the health issues voters say they most want Washington to take on. So we decided to take a closer look.\nWe contacted the Warren campaign, which directed us to a February survey from the Commonwealth Fund, a foundation headquartered in New York.\u00a0\nThe data\nThe Commonwealth data supports Warren\u2019s point; in fact, it\u2019s a slightly larger number than she said on the debate stage.\u00a0\nIn 2018, the researchers estimate, 37 million non-elderly adults went without filling a prescription because they could not afford it. That\u2019s almost 1 in 5 of the U.S. population.\nHaving coverage, the researchers note, doesn\u2019t guarantee you\u2019ll afford medication. The survey makes a point of noting the 87 million non-elderly adults are uninsured, experienced a gap in coverage or \"underinsured\" \u2014 which means they had coverage the entire year, but still faced out-of-pocket costs (excluding premiums) that imposed a substantial financial burden.\nThat\u2019s another point Warren \u2014 and other candidates \u2014 repeated during the debate\u2019s health care portion.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Those are people with health insurance, as well,\" Warren added. \"People who can't do the copays, people without can't do the deductibles.\"\nThe Commonwealth paper suggests much of this \"underinsurance\" issue comes from deterioration of health plans Americans get through work, which is the way most non-elderly Americans get coverage.\nCommonwealth isn\u2019t the only organization to look at this question of prescription drug affordability. A November poll from West Health and Gallup surveyed more than 1,000 adults, asking them if, in the past 12 months, they had not had enough money to afford a doctor-recommended medication.\u00a0\nAbout 23% of respondents reported such an issue \u2014 a figure Gallup extrapolated to suggest 58 million Americans experiencing what it called \"medication insecurity.\"\nMeanwhile, a February poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation found that of adults taking prescription drugs, about one in four reported some difficulty in affording that medication. (KHN is an editorially independent program of the foundation.)\nThe findings drive home a crucial point: broadly, Warren\u2019s number matches what the data shows. If anything, it could be even worse than she suggested.\nOur ruling\nWarren said that last year, 36 million Americans forewent a prescription because of the cost barrier.\nThe data supports her claim. And other research further paints a picture of widespread affordability problems.\nWe rate this claim True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16718"}
