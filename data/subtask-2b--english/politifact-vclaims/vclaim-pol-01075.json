Tony Evers, a Democrat sworn in a mere three weeks earlier.\n\"We don\u2019t blame Foxconn for altering plans in an ever-changing technology business. It\u2019s also not surprising Foxconn would rethink building a manufacturing plant in Wisconsin under the Evers Administration,\" the statement read in part. \"The company is reacting to the wave of economic uncertainty that the new governor has brought with his administration. Governor Evers has an anti-jobs agenda and pledged to do away with a successful business incentive for manufacturing and agriculture.\"\nIs Foxconn really making changes in reaction to \"economic uncertainty\" created by the state\u2019s newly-minted governor?\nLet\u2019s review what we know.\nOfficials offer no evidence\nThis was a fast-moving story, with different accounts of Foxconn\u2019s reported leanings coming from different sources across several days.\nBut in the middle of that, Vos and Fitzgerald made a very specific and concrete claim: that Foxconn was reacting to uncertainty Evers caused.\nWhen we asked Vos and Fitzgerald to back up their claim, Vos spokeswoman Kit Beyer noted a series of changes in Evers\u2019 economic policy positions over time. But she said Republicans had no direct evidence connecting Foxconn\u2019s changes to Evers or any action by the new governor.\n\"The leaders believe that is the case,\" she said.\nMeanwhile, Foxconn hasn\u2019t explicitly laid out its current plans or the reasoning behind them \u2014 but several reports have pointed to market factors rather than political ones.\nLouis Woo, special assistant to Foxconn Chief Executive Terry Gou, voiced concern over the cost of making advanced TV screens in the U.S. due to labor expenses that exceed those in other countries, Reuters reported.\nThe Nikkei story, citing unnamed sources, said plans are on hold due to the trade war between China and the U.S. and uncertainty over demand. Apple is of particular concern, as the top Foxconn customer announced a revenue downgrade this month due to lagging sales.\nNikkei claimed the Wisconsin delay was \"as a result of negotiations with new Gov. Tony Evers,\" citing a company document. But its article did not quote from the document or provide additional details.\nIn any case, Foxconn disputed the Nikkei report and spoke positively of Evers.\n\"The company remains committed to its long-term investment and creating 13,000 jobs in Wisconsin,\" the company said in a statement issued Jan. 31, 2019. \"All interactions to date with Governor Evers and his team have been constructive, and we look forward to further discussions as we continue to invest in American talent and broaden the base of our investment within the State of Wisconsin.\"\nIn addition, Mark Hogan, head of the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp., WEDC, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that Evers has not sought to renegotiate the Foxconn agreement or to pursue any side deals with the company \u2014 as claimed in the Nikkei report.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHogan was appointed by Republican Gov. Scott Walker, who helped negotiate the deal.\n\"I have been involved with the Foxconn project from day one, and there never have been any side deals and the contract stands on its own,\" Hogan said Jan. 31, 2019. \"In addition, there have been no attempts by either the company or the Evers\u2019 or Walker administrations to renegotiate WEDC\u2019s contract.\"\nExperts say Evers\u2019 impact is likely minimal\nAside from what has been reported, there are many other things that undermine the argument that Foxconn is responding to Evers.\nExperts say it simply wouldn\u2019t make sense for Foxconn \u2014 a major global player \u2014 \u00a0to take action in response to a governor who was just sworn in Jan. 7, 2019.\n\"It\u2019s pretty clearly a partisan statement that doesn\u2019t connect to how corporations work,\" said\u00a0Paul Nolette, an associate professor of political science at Marquette University. \"When Foxconn made this deal, they knew an election was coming up in 2018, they knew Gov. Walker could lose. These are all calculations corporations make.\"\nNolette said slowing iPhone sales and the trade war are more likely factors in what exactly Foxconn builds and operates in Wisconsin.\nThe statement by Vos and Fitzgerald expanded on the \"economic uncertainty\" claim by pointing to Evers\u2019 pledge to eliminate a business incentive.\nBut studies show tax rates play a much lesser role in business investment decisions than market demand, supply networks, worker availability and transportation networks, said\u00a0Andrew Reschovsky, professor emeritus of public affairs and applied economics at the University of Wisconsin.\nWhat\u2019s more, there are contradictory aspects in Vos and Fitzgerald\u2019s own statement.\nVos and Fitzgerald say they understand Foxconn changing its plans \"in an ever-changing technology business,\" but then blame Evers for causing changes.\nThey say Foxconn is changing due to Evers, but then note Foxconn hasn\u2019t pulled back on its pledge to create 13,000 new jobs.\n\"You can see kind of a disconnect there,\" Nolette said. \"They\u2019re saying it\u2019s Evers\u2019 fault that the bad things are happening, but really things aren\u2019t that bad because the contract is still in place.\"\nWhich brings us to an important point \u2014 the state has a signed contract in place with Foxconn. It establishes up to $4 billion in cash payments and tax breaks over 15 years in exchange for building the manufacturing facility and creating 13,000 jobs.\nBeyond that, if Evers did seek changes or side deals, Foxconn would not have to agree to them. And any re-negotiations on the contract would have to go through the WEDC board, which thanks to lame-duck legislation pushed by Vos and Fitzgerald, is controlled by Republicans until September.\nOur rating\nRepublican leaders Vos and Fitzgerald said in a joint statement that potential changes in Foxconn\u2019s Wisconsin plans are a result of \"economic uncertainty\" created by Evers \u2014 who has been governor for less than a month.\nA spokeswoman for Vos offered no evidence of that claim, saying merely that the leaders \"believe\" that is the case.\nMeanwhile, the evidence against the claim is steep:\nPublished reports attribute the potential changes to an array of market and economic factors, including labor costs in the U.S., declining consumer demand and the trade war with China. Experts say those are historically the kinds of factors that drive business decisions, not politics.\nFoxconn\u2019s lone public statement on the matter says talks with Evers have been \"constructive.\"\nAnd the CEO of WEDC says Evers has not interfered in the Foxconn contract in any way.\nAll of which makes Vos and Fitzgerald\u2019s claim not only wrong, but ridiculous.
