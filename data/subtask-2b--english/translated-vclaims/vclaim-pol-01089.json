Part of that was an undertaking to withdraw Wisconsin from a multi-state lawsuit that sought to overthrow Obamaker. Under the Government of the Republic. Scott Walker, Wisconsin, is one of the 20 states in the lawsuit, which was filed in February 2018 in Texas. In December 2018, a federal judge in Texas ruled in favour of the states, stating that Obama Carrie was invalid, but that the judgement would not become effective during the appeal. On January 4, 2019, the Democrats at home filed an official request to intervene in the lawsuit in defence of Obamakari. After Evers defeated Walker in the November 2018 elections, the Republican-controlled legislature adopted a ridiculous procedure giving legislators -- not Evers -- the last word about whether Wisconsin was still in the lawsuit. However, during his 22 January 2018 address on the state of the state of the state that made this declaration, Yves was cheering from the Democrats: \"The people of Wisconsin voted for change last November and asked us to stop playing politics with their health care. That is why tonight I made a promise to the people of Wisconsin by directing Attorney General Josh Cole to withdraw from the lawsuit, which would tear the coverage of 2.4 million people in Wisconsin who already had circumstances. In less than 24 hours, all of this was closed. What happened? The Office of Non-Party Legislative References has issued a memorandum stating that Evers has no authority to remove Wisconsin from judicial proceedings under the Public Order Act. On January 26, 2021, Jim Steinke stated on Republican Twitter that they \"come to the table\" and were part of a compromise \"Give and Take\" on the Corona virus bill. Sarah Wuckenhurst, a lawyer at the office, wrote. In such a case, only the Joint Finance Committee of the Legislature has the power to decide to terminate the participation of Wisconsin in the case. It drafted the memorandum at the request of the majority leader of the Senate, Scott Fitzgerald, Republic of Junau. While the Republicans were arguing that Ives had asked Cole to take illegal action, in January 23, 2019, the spokesman for Evers Melissa Baldav said that the Governor \"did not order the Attorney General to take any specific action; he simply withdrew his authority for this action.\" The next day, on January 24, 2019, Cole asked legislators to terminate the participation of the state in the lawsuit to repeal the Affordable Care Act -- more evidence that Evers couldn't do what he said. One day later, on 25 January 2019, Evers said that he \" always believed\" that Cole would apply for permission to withdraw from the lawsuit. \"There's nothing inconsistent with what I said and what was actually going to happen,\" said Evers journalists in Milwaukee. \"I always knew that Josh Cole was going to the Joint Finance Committee.\" In any case, with the speed of lightning, Evers went from the applause line bragging about taking action to fulfil a promise to essentially state the political position: he opposed the lawsuit. In Polyte Fact, we use Flip-O-Meter to measure whether politicians are consistent in a case. Here we are looking narrowly at Cole's issue of withdrawing jurisdiction from the lawsuit. First thing Evers said was he did it. Then he admitted he didn't do it. This is a complete reflection. And, in our book, a complete prank.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01089"}
