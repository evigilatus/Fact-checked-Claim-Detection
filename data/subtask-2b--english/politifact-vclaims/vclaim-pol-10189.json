I've said, \u2018Prove the cost-benefit is there.'\u2009\"\n\nThat could prove of interest to Nov. 6 voters deciding between Huber and Republican opponent Gerald Daugherty, a staunch supporter of building Texas 45 Southwest \u2014 a 3.6-mile road that would connect FM 1626 and South MoPac Boulevard (Loop 1).\n\nHuber has taken action against the project both as a commissioner and as a member of the Capital Area Metropolitan Planning Organization. But has she supported not building it?\n\nThe comment Aleshire flagged came from a Sept. 17, 2012, Austin American-Statesman news story, so we began by talking to the newspaper\u2019s transportation reporter, Ben Wear, and asking Aleshire for evidence contradicting Huber.\n\nWear and archived Statesman stories got us up to speed on the long-proposed project. Currently pitched as a four-lane tollway divided by a median, it\u2019s been part of the CAMPO long-range transportation plan for years; the right-of-way for it was purchased in 1997.\n\nEvery five years, CAMPO\u2019s board approves a rewrite of the 25-year plan, which looks at everything from roads, trains, planes, public transit and freight to bikes and feet in Travis, Williamson, Hays, Bastrop and Caldwell counties. \"Any road or transit project that uses federal money, as most of them do, must be in the plan to qualify for that money,\" said a May 24, 2010, Statesman news story.\n\nThis stretch of Texas 45 Southwest was proposed in the mid-1980s as part of a Texas 45 that encircled the entire metropolitan area and was to be dubbed the Austin Outer Parkway. Some segments were later built, others abandoned.\n\nWear described the road\u2019s potential impact today \u2014 or rather, sometime after 2020 to 2025, when construction might start under CAMPO\u2019s plan \u2014 in his Feb. 5, 2012, column:\n\nA horde of exurbanites from places such as Kyle and Buda comes up FM 1626 each weekday morning to go to work in Austin. Right now, those people have to then take crowded Brodie Lane (and then Slaughter Lane or William Cannon Drive) to get to MoPac. Texas 45 Southwest would allow those commuters a more or less straight shot to MoPac.\n\n\nCritics of Texas 45 Southwest, including Huber, say there\u2019s not enough evidence that the highway would ease Brodie traffic. They also cite environmental concerns, because the road would cross the Edwards Aquifer recharge zone.\n\nIn a June 11, 2010, opinion piece in the Statesman, Huber wrote:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause of constraints on transportation funding, Texas 45 SW is now proposed as a toll road. No study yet demonstrates that commuters would pay the tolls and avoid Brodie. ... It is irresponsible to spend an estimated $100 million on Texas 45 SW without effectively justifying it.\n\nMeanwhile, there are other projects of much more demonstrated need and much higher priority that must be built first, like increasing vehicle capacity on South MoPac Boulevard (Loop 1) and improvements to the Y at Oak Hill.\n\n\nAccording to Statesman news stories, Huber introduced a resolution in May 2010 asking her Commissioners Court colleagues to support culling 45 from the CAMPO plan. It passed 3-1, effectively ending county backing for the road.\n\nHuber is also a member of the CAMPO board, which consists mainly of local elected officials. In that capacity, she made an unsuccessful motion later in May 2010 to drop 45 from the plan.\n\nThe board approved the plan with two votes against (one being Huber\u2019s) and 17 votes in favor. The May 24, 2010, Statesman story quotes Huber: \"We've got real priority problems in this plan. I cannot support this plan, because I cannot support business as usual.\"\n\nThe story said, \"However, she did successfully knock down an eleventh-hour recommendation from TxDOT that construction on Texas 45 Southwest begin in 2015 rather than 2020.\"\n\nAleshire, whom we interviewed by phone and email, sent us news articles and documents describing Huber\u2019s opposition to the road. None quoted Huber saying she wanted to stop the road outright, though they included instances of Huber offering reasons not to proceed immediately. \u00a0\n\nWe asked editors at two local newspapers covering the Texas 45 issue whether they recalled or had reported Huber saying \"Don\u2019t build it\" or something similarly unequivocal. Editor Will Atkins of the Oak Hill Gazette and managing editor Veronica Gordon of the Hays Free Press each told us by phone they did not recall such a statement. Atkins searched his paper\u2019s archives, also finding no such statement.\n\nWhile Aleshire acknowledged he didn\u2019t have direct evidence, he told us that the \"proof is her motion at Commissioners Court to remove it from the county plans and her motion at CAMPO to delete it from the Metropolitan Transportation Plan entirely, making the project ineligible for state or federal funding.\"\n\nWere Huber\u2019s actions to pull 45 out of the plan equivalent to saying \"Don\u2019t build it\"?\n\nIn a phone interview, CAMPO director Maureen McCoy told us she didn\u2019t think removing 45 from the plan would keep it from being built because it could later be restored to the plan by an amendment. It\u2019s \"not atypical\" for a road to be added to the plan that way, she said.\n\nIf the road weren\u2019t in the plan, it wouldn\u2019t be eligible for federal funding. We asked TxDOT Austin spokesman Chris Bishop how likely it was that the state could build such a road. \"We have done roads without it,\" he said. \"Matter of fact, at one point I remember this was proposed as being done with state funds.\"\n\nHe recalled two nearby examples of roads built with state funding, albeit two decades ago: Texas 45 Southwest between FM 1826 and MoPac and the stretch of South MoPac to Texas 71/Ben White Boulevard.\n\nWhether the puzzle pieces of state funding, local funding, potential toll revenues, etc., would come together for this road is a variable, he and McCoy said, as is the project\u2019s eventual cost. McCoy pointed out that the study now being conducted on the road\u2019s environmental impact could indicate, for example, that the road should have two lanes instead of four.\n\nBy telephone, Huber told us she\u2019s been consistent in her position: \"I\u2019m saying, on that road, that I do not believe we should move forward with it till we conclude that it is going to do what they say it is going to do\" (in easing Brodie traffic).\n\nNow, in fact, Huber said she doesn\u2019t mind keeping 45 in the CAMPO plan, because that allows the environmental study to continue. \u00a0\n\n\"I just don\u2019t believe we should go to construction until we have answers.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nHuber claimed that she\u2019s never said \"don\u2019t build\" Texas 45 Southwest.\n\nAs far as we can tell, there\u2019s no instance of Huber being so blunt. But her efforts to get the road pulled from the CAMPO plan and her stated desire not to proceed to construction without more information are evidence she doesn\u2019t want the project built yet.\n\nThese important details are not reflected in her statement, which we rate Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10189"}
