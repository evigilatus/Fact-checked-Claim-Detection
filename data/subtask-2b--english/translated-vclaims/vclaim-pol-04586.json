While Trump wants to deport millions of undocumented migrants, he also uses the system for the employment of foreigners, Bloomberg said in his endorsement of Hillary Clinton 27 July 2016. Trump \"plays the U.S. visa system so that he can hire temporary foreign workers with low wages,\" said Bloomberg. While the accusation that Trump \"plays the system\" is a difficult language, Tycon has hired temporary foreign workers to fill traditionally low-paid jobs in his property. We'll explain how he did it. The H-2B visas were not accessible to Bloomberg's spokesman, but it was likely to refer to Trump, who employs foreign workers at the Mar-A-Lago Club, an exclusive food club in a palace in Palm Beach County, Florida. Ted Cruz made a similar attack during the primary stage. The club sought H-2B visas for low-skilled workers and low wages such as cooks, waiters and housekeepers. The H-2B visas are legal - Congress has set a ceiling of 66,000 per year - and its agricultural counterpart is H-2A. The vast majority of workers in these visa programmes throughout the country are young Mexicans, despite news reports that Trump is looking for workers from Europe. Employers say they need these temporary workers to fill jobs that Americans do not want, while critics say that workers can be exploited. Since visas are linked to a particular job, foreigners simply cannot jump on ships for better paid work in another resort. The worker is paid on the basis of the prevailing wage or minimum wage. Since 2010, approximately 300 residents of the United States have submitted applications or been transferred to posts in Mar-a-Lago, but only 17 of them have been recruited, and the New York Times reported in February. At the same time, Mar-a-Lago sought more than 500 visas for foreign workers. (The visas were also requested in some of his other properties.) We do not know how many people have used visas and become employees. In order to obtain visas, businesses must prove that they have not succeeded in holding jobs with Americans or legal residents. According to the Ministry of Economic Opportunities of Florida, the resort has created jobs through the Florida Employment Resource Network, the local labour force development councils throughout the state. A former spokesman for the United States Department of Labor, Politi Fact Florida, said that 93 people applied for 250 seasonal jobs at the resort. Four persons were engaged, while 79 of them did not respond to requests for interviews or rejected their posts (10 requests classified as unknown). Documents subsequently submitted by the resort to the Ministry of Labour showed that many American applicants had not been recruited because they did not meet the requirements. Some applicants did not want to work in fragmented shifts, lack experience, want full-time jobs instead of part-time work, or did not respond when the resort contacted them. Following that process, the Ministry of Labour issued 685 H-2B entry visas to the Mar-a-Lago Club between 2008 and 2015. The New York Times asked Trump why so many foreign workers were hired when Americans offered the same positions. On February 1, 2021, Tom Cotton mentioned in an interview with Fox and friends \"Many of these arriving immigrants, we have no way of checking their background for either health or security.\" \"The only reason they didn't call is because they weren't qualified for some reason,\" answered Trump. \"There are very few qualified persons during the high season in the region.\" However, some experts doubt Trump's assessment that it is difficult to find local assistance. In 2015, the Foundation assisted in the recruitment of approximately 1,800 candidates for hospitality positions in Palm Beach County. However, Mar-a-Lago did not show much interest in the use of free service. Tom Fencetra, Senior Director of Support Services, SypingSource, Palm Beach County, Politi Fact Florida, reported that the first time his office received a request for assistance in finding workers was September 2015. (That was shortly after one of the first news reports, by Reuters, on the practices of Trump in foreign recruitment.) Since then, Mar-a-Lago has used the office to hire only one person, a banquet servant. \"We contacted the Human Resources Director after the appointment, and she said that they were satisfied with the appointment and the candidates we sent,\" said Vinstra. \"There has been nothing else since then.\" So is Trump messing with the system? Gabriel \"Jack\" Chen, a professor at the University of California Davis School of Law, said that many of these companies say they can't find American workers but are making little effort. \"The first answer is, \"Yes, this is to play with the system, but everyone does it, in the sense that the standards of a work certificate are widely believed to be avoided in the way that Mar-a-lago did in the past,\" Chen said. We referred Trump Stephen Miller to Trump &apos; s response during the 10 March debate in Miami when he defended the use of these visas. \"I'm a businessman,\" said Trump. \"These are laws. These are the regulations. These are the rules. We're allowed to do that. And frankly, because of the devaluation that other countries are doing -- the monetary cuts that other countries constantly make and do brilliantly against us, it is very difficult for our firms in this country, in our country, to compete. So I'm gonna take advantage of it, it's the rules. But I'm the one who knows how to change it. No one else on these fabrics knows how to change it like I do, believe me.\" Miller said that Trump was opposed to legislation to expand the visa programme and undertook to reform visa programmes to protect American workers. Our rule, Bloomberg, says that Trump plays with the American visa system so he can hire temporary foreign workers with low wages. Trump has sought visas for hundreds of foreign workers for temporary positions at the Mar-a-Lago Club in Florida in recent years. Hundreds of applicants from the United States either applied or were referred to work, but only a few were recruited. There is some debate as to whether these applicants are qualified or not. Trump used a legal program to get workers on H-2B visas. He says he's \"playing\" the system as a harsh language, and the process expert says it's common Trump. We're mostly assessing this claim right. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/90e178a-a06c-4fa1-913-f-1777415af770", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04586"}
