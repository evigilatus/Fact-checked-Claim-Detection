But White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany tweeted an alternative estimate of the demonstration\u2019s attendance.\n\"AMAZING! More than one MILLION marchers for President @realDonaldTrump descend on the swamp in support,\" McEnany said in the tweet, which has been shared more than 56,000 times.\nThe post took us back to January 2017, when Trump\u2019s first press secretary, Sean Spicer, claimed the crowd at Trump\u2019s inauguration \"was the largest audience to witness an inauguration, period.\" We rated that claim Pants on Fire!\nSince Trump retweeted a claim that more than a million people gathered in Washington to support him, we wanted to take a closer look at McEnany\u2019s tweet.\n\n(Screenshot from Twitter)\nThe claim is wrong. News outlets that covered the protests estimated that thousands, not more than 1 million, attended them. It\u2019s mathematically impossible for more than 135,000 people to fit in the location that McEnany tweeted a photo of.\nOn the morning of Nov. 14, several concurrent events \u2014 including the Million MAGA March, the March for Trump and Stop the Steal DC \u2014\u00a0converged near Freedom Plaza in Washington. Among the demonstrators were conspiracy theorists, right-wing activists alleging widespread election fraud and members of the Proud Boys, a far right, all-male group with a history of violent confrontations.\nSeveral Washington news outlets estimated that the pro-Trump demonstrations had thousands of attendees. Trump himself has tweeted various estimates of the crowd size, ranging from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands. Women for America First, one of the groups that demonstrated, secured a National Park Service permit for 10,000 people in Freedom Plaza.\nHere are a few other estimates of the crowd size on Nov. 14:\n\n\nFox News: \"Tens of thousands\"\n\n\nThe Washington Post: \"Thousands\"\n\n\nWUSA: \"Thousands\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWTOP: \"Thousands\"\n\n\nCNN: \"Thousands\"\n\n\nUSA Today: \"Tens of thousands\"\n\n\nThe Washington Times: \"Thousands\"\n\n\nWashingtonian: \"Thousands\"\n\n\nWe asked the Metropolitan Police Department for its best estimate of the attendance at the weekend\u2019s Washington-area demonstrations, which grew violent toward the end of the day when hundreds of counterprotesters showed up. Brianna Jordan, a public affairs specialist, said the MPD \"does not provide numbers on crowd size.\"\nIt\u2019s difficult to gauge crowd size, and estimates are just that \u2014\u00a0estimates. But there is no evidence that more than 1 million people attended pro-Trump demonstrations in Washington over the weekend.\nIn her tweet, McEnany included two screenshots of a Fox News broadcast about the gatherings. The footage shows demonstrators on a street near Freedom Plaza, which is a few blocks east of the White House, a little after 11 a.m. Eastern Time.\nMcEnany tweeted her estimate at 11:16 a.m. ET, before the marches were officially set to begin at noon. It\u2019s also not possible for more than 135,000 people to fit into Freedom Plaza and the surrounding streets and sidewalks, according to MapChecking, an online tool that uses a mathematical equation to estimate how many people can fit in a given location.\nThe stills that McEnany shared show plenty of space between demonstrators. For there to be 105,000 people depicted in the photos,\u00a0which MapChecking classifies as \"packed\" for the location, there would have to have been four people per square meter. The National Park Service says the maximum capacity for Freedom Plaza is 13,900.\nFor comparison, estimates of the crowd size at Trump\u2019s inauguration ranged from\u00a0250,000 to 600,000. And that event was held on the National Mall, where there is far more space for people to spread out.\nAlso in 2017, at least 470,000 people were estimated to have showed up for the Women\u2019s March near the National Mall in Washington. Estimates for the crowd size at the 1995 Million Man March, which inspired the name of the Million MAGA March, vary widely, ranging between 400,000 and 1.9 million.\nWe reached out to the White House for a comment, but we haven\u2019t heard back.\nMcEnany\u2019s tweet is inaccurate. We rate it False.\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections FactChat #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click\u00a0here\u00a0for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18529"}
