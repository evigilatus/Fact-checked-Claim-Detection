In this spot, a man from Fort Worth who knows he's a cancer survivor said Manuel Alvarado: \"When you fight cancer, you pray for a cure. But Greg Abbott did his best to prevent my prayers from being answered.\" Abbott, Alvarado says, \"He was charged with overseeing the State Cancer Research Fund. But he allowed his richest donor to take tens of millions of dollars from taxpayers without proper oversight. They showered with gifts and free holidays and fled with the money they were supposed to find a cure.\" Davies, a member of the State Senate of Fort Worth, has sought to implicate Abbott, the State Attorney General, in the scandal swallowed two years ago by the Institute for Cancer Prevention and Research in Texas. In May 2014, according to the American Austin-State News story, she confirmed that Abbott's donors were also investing in companies that received improper grants from foundations. Jerry Strickland, spokesman for the State of Abbott, replied that the Attorney General &apos; s Office had been involved in an investigation that had led to the indictment of the province of Travis for Gerald \"Jerry\" Cobbs, a former Executive Director of the Institute who had participated in a grant of $11 million for the Blueton processors, although the introduction of biotechnology had not undergone the necessary external scientific review. - Cobbs is awaiting trial. So, was Abbott assigned to oversee the cancer control fund? Did he allow campaign donors to take tens of millions of dollars from taxpayers? Did donors flood him with gifts and holidays? The 2007 Act establishing the Institute, its administrative body or its oversight committee consists of nine appointed members in addition to the public prosecutor, the public defender appointed, the State Comptroller or the Controller. As of 2009, the Commission had an unprecedented function of giving millions of dollars to cancer-related projects after Texas voters agreed to issue $3 billion in bonds over 10 years to \"finance pilot research and cancer prevention programmes and services in Texas,\" the Institute states on its website. The 2013 Legislature, which responded to red flags, including grants made despite scientific concerns, reduced the Oversight Committee. The Governor, the Deputy Governor and the Speaker of the State Council of Texas will continue to appoint their nine members, but the revised law abolished the mandate of the Attorney General and the State Comptroller or all those appointed by them, in accordance with the summary of the Senate Research Centre for Changes in July 2013. Also new: Any person named on the panel must disclose to the institute every political contribution to a candidate for the post of state or federal office in excess of $1,000 provided by the person in the five years preceding the appointment, and each year after the appointment of the person until the expiration of his or her term of office, with the Institute publishing a summary each year, the Centre &apos; s books. As to our question, a spokesman for Davis, Zack Pettanas, said that the August Declaration of Democrats was based on news stories and editorial articles. Among these stories, one of the accounts of the Dalas Morning News on 11 May 2013 stated that Abbott had not attended any of the 23 meetings held by the Council to date. By e-mail, Strickland told us Abbott never voted on a grant, and he wasn't involved in any application, review or award. I quoted the news story from Abbott, saying that the selection of a high-ranking state assistant to replace him allowed me to retain independence. Strickland told us that the designer Abbott on the committee, James \"Jay\" Dyer, voted like the other board members at the meetings he attended, although he was also unaware of the issues surrounding the grants that were being questioned because they were due to \"misconduct, mismanagement and failure to disclose\" by the senior staff of the institute, as Strickland said. In December 2012, the Attorney General &apos; s Office announced that it was considering the operations of the Institute. Strickland told us the forensic unit in the office helped Travis to interrupt the investigation by retrieving deleted e-mails and data files that the Institute's staff claimed to have lost. \"Because the matter investigated by this Office in conjunction with the Public Integrity Unit is currently the subject of an ongoing trial,\" Strickland said, \"Our investigation has not been closed and we cannot comment further on this matter.\" In January 2013, after Travis County began the investigation that led to the indictment of the Executive Institute, the District Attorney, Rosemary Limberg, told the members of the Commission (including probably Abbott) \"they are not in doubt about the investigation,\" the United States man said in a news story at the time. But Limburg didn't exonerate the entire institute by saying, \"We're far from finishing our efforts.\" By that day, the story was told, three senior executives resigned and left the cancer control agency. The Institute and the news stories cited by Davis referred to the major donors of Republican candidates with links to the entities that received the Institute &apos; s awards, although we did not see any stories indicating that millions of dollars went directly to Abbott &apos; s donors. According to the 2013 news story, on June 18, 2010, the Institute &apos; s Oversight Committee endorsed the $11 million Blueton Treatment Award, which was described as using laboratory discoveries at the Medical Center of the South West University of Texas to try to develop anti-cancer drugs. This grant was provided without the required commercial or scientific review, as the story stated, with the absence of the designer Abbott from the meeting. Check the facts (Kirk Cox) was mentioned on January 13, 2021 in a speech. Virginia ranked lowest third of the states in the management of the COVID-19 vaccine. \u2022 On January 20, 2012, The News reported that since 2002, three Committee members who had endorsed the Billton Award had contributed $150,000 to Abbott's campaigns. Of these, Charles Tate, an investor in Houston, had raised $140,000 for Abbott campaigns. Of this, Tate contributed $100,000 in November 2012, which would have taken about three weeks before the Abbott office announced its own probe. The paper said that at least one investor from Pilton had ties to Abbott, too. Improved Dallas Peter O'Donnell, a financial supporter of Belton, has contributed $130,000 to the Abbott campaigns since 2001. Earlier, O'Donnell said that he had invested in Pluton in July 2011, more than a year after the approval of the Award by the Commission, the newspaper reported. O'Donnell was associated with a scholarship from another lighted institute. In January 2013, the Texas State Auditor, John Kell, issued an audit that raised questions about the Agency &apos; s largest grant, which was awarded $25.2 million in June 2010 to the state-wide clinical trial network in Texas, CATNET, which was established to accelerate clinical trials of cancer drugs, and reported to the Houston Chronicle at that time. According to The Facts, \"The Future Agent\" was Caroline Bacon Dixon, Executive Director of O'Donnell, linked to Peter O'Donnell. Kyle said in the audit that the CTNET award was like the Peloton Grant, although there was no positive recommendation from peer scientists. At around the time of the state audit, CTNET ceased operations after the Institute cut off its funding, according to the stateman's news story of 29 January 2013. The Davis campaign proposed another awful relationship - albeit indirect - with the CTBT grant. Steve Hicks of Austin, who donated $193,000 to Abbott's campaigns, according to a news story on March 1, 2014 in the San Antonio Express News, is the CEO of Capstar Partners, an investment company whose partner John Colleen was described in the report of the Foundation of July 2011 as a member of the Board of Directors of CTNET. (Our examination of State records showed that Collin, known as the director of Mood Media Consulting, provided $1,000 to Abbott's cat on 26 September 2013. Another Pitkanas male supporter of Abbott is related to the Institute. On 27 July 2013, Cronkel News reported that the businessman of San Antonio James Leninger, who had been described as a donation of $289,000 to the Abbott Campaigns since 2001, had had a biotechnology company, Caliper Bioranacts, which had received $12 million from the Institute to implement a proposal despite receiving low ratings from reviewers. According to a November 2011 publication on the Institute &apos; s website, the Institute approved a $12.8 million grant for the company, based at the Brian Coolig Station, to manufacture aquatic plants to better treat antibodies against two types of cancer. Calibur biotherapy is not Leninger's company. However, it includes its only institutional investment fund in medical care, which is posted on its Leninger website as its founder. When we called for medical care in Nashville, the person who answered the phone said that Leninger was still involved, although she refused to provide details or to be identified before transmitting us to San Antonio's phone number where we asked for details that were not generated. For our phone and e-mail queries, both the bioprocessors and Leninger made no comment. Taking a shower of gifts, holidays? By e-mail, Betanas first told us Leininger was the example of a gift and travel campaign that was washed up in Abbott by donors with a share in entities that received grants from the Institute. According to the 2014 Express-News story, Leininger paid for Abbott &apos; s travel and residence three times between 2008 and 2010, according to Abbott &apos; s personal financial statements. Every government official must report any gift worth more than $250. We confirmed the described flights funded by Leninger (one each in 2008, 2009 and 2010 from Abbott &apos; s files; none of the entries that described the scheduled flight as a holiday were included while Camp Abbott did not respond immediately when we asked whether the talented flights were vacations. Hicks - investor whose partner Colleen was a member of the Board of Directors of CTBT - joined his wife Donna in giving Abbott the membership of a travel guide in 2009, notify Abbott. Our verdict, Davis, said Abbott was in charge of overseeing the State Cancer Research Fund. But he allowed his richest donor to take tens of millions of dollars from taxpayers without proper oversight. They were bathed in a coffin with gifts and free holidays. There's something here, but Davis leaves objective details. Abbott was in a large committee set up to oversee the Institute &apos; s awards, although he was appointed assistant to work in his place, not once to attend. It was also not reported that the Abbott Office assisted the Travis District Office in the investigation, which led to the indictment of an IDEP staff member; the local prosecutor also stated that the members of the Commission were not suspected of having committed unlawful acts. One of Abbott &apos; s major donors undertook three trips, valued at more than $250 each, to Abbott &apos; s family, but contrary to the letter of announcement, this is not the same as all donors to the campaign associated with the grant-giving of Abbott with gifts and free holidays. Anyway, we're assessing this statement half right. The truth is now - the statement is partially accurate, but it ignores important details or leaves things out of context.
