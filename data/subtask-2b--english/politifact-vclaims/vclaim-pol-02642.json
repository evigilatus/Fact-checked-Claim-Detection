GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine has expressed concern over the inclusion of this provision in the tax bill, which needs approval from nearly all Republican senators to pass.\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was the latest Democrat to lodge a comparable criticism of the bill.\nThe GOP tax plan \"Sabotages the health care of 13 MILLION Americans,\" Pelosi\u2019s political team wrote on Twitter on Nov. 27, 2017 as part of a longer list of criticisms of the bill.\n\nPolitiFact New York and The Washington Post\u00a0have fact-checked similar statements by Democratic leaders about the bill's impact on health care. They found those claims were partially accurate but ignored key facts.\nWe\u2019ll take a look at those and rate Pelosi\u2019s statement.\nSimilar claims\nEarlier this month, PolitiFact New York rated Half True the claim by Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo: Congressional Republicans \"want to take health care from millions of Americans in order to pay for\" a tax bill.\nIt found Cuomo had a point: Ending the individual mandate would result in an estimated 13 million fewer Americans with health coverage by 2027, according to the Congressional Budget Office analysis.\nPelosi\u2019s spokesman pointed to the same CBO report when PolitiFact California asked for evidence backing up the congresswoman\u2019s claim.\nIn its analysis, however, PolitiFact New York pointed out that ending the individual mandate isn\u2019t the same thing as stripping away health insurance for a large number of Americans. While some would lose access to health insurance due to increased premiums, many others would drop their coverage voluntarily.\nThe Washington Post Fact Checker, meanwhile, gave Two Pinocchios \u2014\u00a0which it describes as its Half True rating \u2014\u00a0to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer when he said, \"We\u2019re kicking 13 million people off health insurance to give tax cuts to the wealthy.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin Nunes\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in an interview on Fox\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRepublicans have no way to communicate\u201d after tech companies cut off Parler.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Amy Sherman \u2022 January 13, 2021\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Post described the first part of Schumer\u2019s statement as \"problematic.\"\n\"CBO, in estimating the impact of repealing the individual mandate, is mostly describing a voluntary action of people choosing not to buy health insurance. That\u2019s not the same as \"kicking off\" 13 million people. Granted, some people may feel they don\u2019t have a choice because their premiums increased. Senate Democrats need to more accurately describe the CBO report,\" the Post concluded.\nSabotage?\nPelosi, through her political team\u2019s tweet, claims the GOP tax plan \"sabotages\" the health care of 13 million Americans. We took this to mean it intentionally strips health care from millions. If healthy people leave the individual market, premiums will go up for the remaining and sicker enrollees. That could force some people to drop their plans due to cost.\nBut, as with the claims from Cuomo and Schumer, the statement from Pelosi and her staff ignores the fact that a large portion of the 13 million people would voluntarily drop their plans and would not see a direct health impact.\nPolitiFact New York cited research from RAND Corp. that estimated roughly two-thirds of disenrollment would stem from voluntary choices and one-third would be involuntary. Other research has put the percentage at about 50-50, said Linda Blumberg, a health policy specialist at the Urban Institute.\nOur ruling\nNancy Pelosi recently claimed\u00a0the GOP tax plan \"Sabotages the health care of 13 MILLION Americans.\"\nShe has a partial point: Senate Republicans have proposed eliminating the ACA\u2019s requirement that all Americans have health insurance or pay a penalty. By getting rid of this, the CBO estimates 13 million fewer people would have insurance a decade from now.\nMany would voluntarily leave the individual health care marketplace, driving up premiums for those who remain, forcing some who want to keep their insurance to drop it.\nBut like other top Democrats, Pelosi left out much of the story. \"Sabotaged\" just doesn\u2019t fit for the two-thirds of those researchers say would leave voluntarily.\nPolitiFact New York and The Washington Post\u00a0examined similar claims and rated them the equivalent of Half True. They were partially accurate but omitted key information.\nWe agreed with their assessments.\nWe also rate Pelosi\u2019s claim Half True.\n\nHALF TRUE\u00a0\u2013 The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.\n Share the Facts 2017-11-29 22:53:13 UTC   PolitiFact    4 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Half True  The GOP tax plan \"Sabotages the health care of 13 MILLION Americans.\"    Nancy Pelosi House Minority Leader https://twitter.com/TeamPelosi/status/935273723220889601    Monday, November 27, 2017 2017-11-27    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02642"}
