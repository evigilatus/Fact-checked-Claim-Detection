Other fact-checkers have found another post misidentifying a woman wearing a pink crocheted hat during the 2017 Women\u2019s March on Washington as Karlan. Now a Dec. 5 Facebook post claims to show a photo of \"Pamela Karlan when Hillary lost.\"\u00a0\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

But the person in the image is actually Janna DeVylder, who was photographed at an election party in Australia that year.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.
