That confuses the picture", "text": ":: Near the end of its cycle on CNN in the city of climate change, host Chris Komo Sen asked Elizabeth Warren about the light bulbs. Specifically, if the government has to tell people what kind of lamps they can get. The democratic presidential candidate put this issue as a departure from the real task at hand. \"This is exactly what the fossil fuel industry hopes we're all talking about,\" said Warren. \"They want to be able to stir up a lot of controversy about your cheese lumber and straws, when 70% of the carbon pollution we throw into the air comes from three industries.\" After the municipal hall, Warren repeated 70% statistics on Instagram. This article on Instagram's fossil fuel industry wants to keep us arguing about electric lamps and cheeseburgers while 70% of the pollution comes from only three industries. We need to focus on bringing about major structural change to address this climate crisis and corruption directly in Washington. #ClimateTownHall a been occupied by Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethwarren) on Sip 4, 2019 at 8:20 p.m. PDT we questioned the three industries that the Democratic Presidential candidate was thinking about. We directed Warren's campaign to the US EPA. The Agency &apos; s page on sources of greenhouse gas emissions shows that three sectors - transport, electricity production and industry - account for 78 per cent of the United States total. But these are activities and not industries per se. Transport, the three largest, includes people-driven cars and the trips they take to work and enjoy. The co-director of the MIT joint programme on the science and policy of global change, John Riley, said, \"It is, of course, odd to say \"three industries,\" one of which is \"industry.\" Riley said that the focus on industry diverts attention away from the broader ways in which energy consumption is embedded in the fabric of American life. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 January 11, 2021 \"This may imply that the cost of reducing these emissions will fall on industry,\" he said. \"To the extent that the myth continues, this is a problem. In one way or another, we will all bear the cost of doing things differently.\" The climate researchers we got said that Warren's term wasn't okay. Wherever it was different, the importance lay in that. In contrast to Riley, Gavin Schmidt, Director of NASA's Goddard Institute of Space Studies, said that he did not find it a major issue. As it turns out, Warren used 70% in two more accurate ways, without saying \"industry.\" Earlier during the municipal hall, Warren said that she wanted to focus on \"the three regions where we get the most carbon pollution in America now.\" \"They're in our buildings and our homes, right? What we burn It's our cars and our light trucks we're driving. It's electricity generation where we still use a lot of carbon-based fuels to do it.\" She said that eliminating the carbon footprint in three by 2035 would cut 70% of the carbon that we're currently throwing into the air. This is a slightly different mix of sources, and based on EPA figures, it adds to the reduction claimed by Warren. In Warren's clean energy plan the day before the city hall, it was quite accurate. \"Electrification, transport, buildings, and related commercial activities are responsible for approximately 70% of all carbon emissions in the United States,\" written. Our governor Warren said that three industries account for 70% of the carbon that goes into the air. This is inaccurate. It is true that transport, electricity production and industry are the three largest sources of greenhouse gases and account for more than 70 per cent of the problem. But these are activities, not industries. Individual Americans and companies contribute to this situation in ways that are often intertwined. Warren herself was more accurate in her energy plan and even during the municipality hall itself. But it pushed the focus on industry on social media, and climate change researchers say that the word is out of proportion to the 70% figure that I used. We're assessing this claim half right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00188"}
