Iran's nuclear dollars cannot cover 30 walls with Mexico", "text": "A Facebook page called \"The Veterans' Memorial\" published the statement, \"We can build 30 walls with $150 billion that Obama has given Iran.\" The article was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We assume that since 5 times 30 is 150, the author compares $5.6 billion to President Donald Trump being required for a wall in the last government closure. Both elements have holes. The cost of the wall is a simple reading of the point that America can build a wall along the border with Mexico for about $5 billion. It's not. The Department of Homeland Security never claimed that. Its plan was to use funds to build 215 miles along the highest priority sectors. As things go today, by the time the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection builds the sections funded by Congress, the United States will have barriers covering just under one third of the 2,000-mile border. US Customs and Border Protection estimated that it would cost $18 billion for 722 miles of barriers. This is only for 17 priority sites. The Government Accountability Office stated that this figure was questionable, because it was \"based on the average cost of one mile and was not intended to reflect the costs of individual construction projects.\" Facebook was published on January 11, 2021 in Facebook, Nancy Belusi, who was no longer Speaker of the House of Representatives by Samantha Buterman on January 12, 2021. (For what it's worth, with a tramp rate of 215 miles, the cost of covering each remaining mile of the boundary would be approximately $30 billion.) Other estimates estimate the total at more than $25 billion.) So let's now look at the money in the multinational deal to end Iran's nuclear development work. While critics of this deal, like President Donald Trump, would have liked to say that Iran received $150 billion of it, our research shows that this is a mistake in many ways. First, according to a certificate from the United States Secretary of the Treasury (Jacob Lew), the total is about $56 billion. Some analysts say it's less than that. Secondly, it is not right to say that the United States gave Iran this money. A little bit of the total was under U.S. control. The only dollar in the hands of the United States Government was only about $1.7 billion of United States weapons purchased by Iran, but never delivered. The rest of the funds were initially funds of Iran and were held in banks around the world. Thirdly, seven Governments have signed the Agreement, including China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom and the European Union. So putting the deal on President Barack Obama alone is off the mark. While the agreement could have been breached, so could any of the others. Our Facebook article said that for the money Obama gave Iran, America could build 30 walls with Mexico. The basic figures are $150 billion for Iran and $5 billion for a wall with Mexico. None of the numbers hold. The Trump administration said that the $5 billion you asked for for the wall would only build 215 miles. This would leave more than half of the border untouched. The money from Iran's deal could be as much as $56 billion, perhaps less. So five billion dollars didn't build a wall and Iran didn't get $150 billion. We value this wrong mail.
