Approximately 200,000 Florida voters may not be citizens of https://t.co/8HiObPLEEM via @nbc6 - Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJtrompJr) 12 November 2018 Twitter attracted over 28,000 loved in less than 24 hours. But it's not accurate. It is based on a selected number of cherry from a headline that did not tell the whole story in 2012. At the beginning of the State &apos; s efforts to cleanse non-citizens of the voters &apos; lists, State officials came up with a list of some 182,000 names. But Trump Jr. deletes that the final number of non-citizens who were cleansed was a small point of that original figure. When it is considered in the context of all registered voters - or even ballot papers - in Florida or the nation, it is rare for non-citizens to prove that they have forged voters. The history of the cleansing of non-citizens in Florida has been involved in a controversial attempt to search for non-citizens &apos; voters, leading to the 2012 elections. The search was full of mistakes, and it was eventually dropped after a few of them were found. * Shortly after the Government of the Republic Rick Scott took office in 2011, and asked the Chief Electoral Officer at that time to consider removing non-citizens from the voters &apos; lists. By 2012, the Electoral Division had developed a list of potential non-citizens based on driver &apos; s licence data. Trump mentioned a headline from the first of that process. It was associated with the story of May 2012 on NBC Miami: \"Elect 2012: approximately 200,000 Florida voters may not be citizens.\" The story was written by Associated Press. Why was the President's son sharing a six-year-old story? Matthew Gerts of the liberal media website noted that prior to Trump's tweeting son, the conservatives published the 2012 story. David Wall, father of the conspiracy theory Jacob Wall, tweeted a link to a story in November 10, as Harlan Hill and Charlie Kirk did. He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. By Bill McCarthy, on 12 January 2021 in November 12, before Trump Jr.'s tweet, NBC Miami listed an editor's note on the top of the original story. First, she reminded readers that the story had been published in 2012. She then gave the historical lesson on how the State List contained errors: AP reported that the preliminary list showed approximately 182,000 people who might not be American citizens, based on driver's license data. Of this group, the State sent an initial list of more than 2,600 voter names to the district election supervisors. As we mentioned and NBC's editor's note, the State eventually delisted and deleted 85 voters because they were \"not from the United States. \"Citizen.\" The supervisors noted all kinds of errors and later used words such as \"pollution\" and \"awkward\" to describe the State initiative, which Polyte Fact found. One problem was that driver &apos; s licence data were not updated when the legal resident subsequently became a citizen. :: By September 2012, when the Electoral Division issued a new list of some 200 unqualified voters, the supervisors were burdened, and efforts seemed to be fading as the presidential election approached. The State stated that it would make another effort to clear non-citizens of the voters &apos; lists almost a year later, but that it had been eliminated. We have not been able to find any other type of comprehensive data on non-citizens who have been removed from Florida. We contacted the State Electoral Section but did not respond on time. Jason Sneed tracks cases of electoral fraud in the United States of America for the Conservative Heritage Foundation, which include cases that resulted in criminal convictions, fines or official discovery of fraud. The database showed 13 entries from Florida that included non-citizens who had registered and/or voted successfully in the elections. These cases were from 2003-2006. In a report issued in May 2017 by the Brennan Center for Justice of the University of New York, it was found that election officials in 42 jurisdictions had referred an estimated 30 incidents of suspected non-citizens voting for further investigation or prosecution out of more than 23 million votes. Myrna Perez, the director of the Centre's voting and election rights project and co-author of the study, said: \"The kind of cases in which an individual voter tries to pretend to be another person or vote when he is not eligible for election are not the statistically significant events on which we have to worry.\" As Florida has seen, three major races have been re-screened, Tramp Jr. rewrites the address that said, \"Almost 200,000 Florida voters may not be citizens.\" He said it was \"awesome, but no longer shocking.\" It's actually not true, it's years old. The same story gives a more complete picture and a written note with explanations ignored by Trump. The voter clearance process in the state of 2012 began with a list of potentially 182,000 non-citizens on the voters &apos; lists. The list was delivered by State officials to more than 2,600 names sent to district election supervisors. In the end, 85 non-citizens were deported. We value this allegation wrong. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/52ee7474-bb55-41c4-a7c7-aeffdc759a67", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01265"}
