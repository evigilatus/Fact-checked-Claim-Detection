(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nHarris \u2014 the first Black woman and first person of Indian descent to be on a major-party presidential ticket in the United States \u2014 has stated her support for studying reparations, but has stopped short of endorsing direct payments. We found no evidence that she has supported any tax for reparations.\nUnderstanding reparations\nSince 1989, Democrats have introduced bills that call for studying reparations for African Americans to address the nation\u2019s legacy of slavery.\nHouse leaders have said they expect to pass this year, for the first time, a proposal creating a federal commission to craft an official government apology and remedy plan. Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, supports a study.\nBlack Americans constitute about 13% to 14% of the nation\u2019s population, but own less than 3% of the nation\u2019s wealth, according to testimony to a House committee given in 2019 by William Darity Jr., a professor of public policy and African American studies at Duke University. \"Reparations designated specifically for Black American descendants of slavery must be enacted\" to move Black wealth roughly, from less than $3 trillion to between $13 trillion and $14 trillion, he said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHarris\u2019 position\nBefore ending her own run for the Democratic presidential nomination in December 2019, Harris, a California senator, supported studying reparations. But she did not call for them to take the form of payments. We looked through her interviews and comments she made during her campaign and found no statements from her in support of direct payments or a tax on homes to fund such payments.\nAsked in a February 2019 interview if Black people should get reparations, Harris said: \"I think there has to be some form of reparations, and we can discuss what that is.\"\nIn another February 2019 interview, she cited a proposal to help families generally, saying: \"I\u2019m proposing the LIFT Act. Give people who are making $100,000 or less as a family a tax credit, which will benefit and uplift 60% of Black families who are in poverty.\"\nAn interviewer in March 2019 noted that Harris had floated the idea of mental-health funding as a form of reparations. Harris again steered away from direct payments: \"I think that the word, the term reparations, it means different things to different people,\" she said. \"But what I mean by it is that we need to study the effects of generations of discrimination and institutional racism and determine what can be done, in terms of intervention, to correct course.\"\nIn April 2019, Harris said in response to a question that if elected president, she would sign a bill to study paying reparations.\nIn an August 2019 interview, Harris repeated her support for a study, but said: \"If we're talking about writing a check, I don't think it is that simple. And frankly, I don't support an idea or a notion that after all this, we're going to say, 'OK, I'm going to write you a check, and then be quiet.' Because that won't solve the problem, which is the systemic issues that are present and will continue to exist.\"\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post claims Harris proposed a federal tax on homes to pay for slavery reparations.\nThere\u2019s no evidence to support that claim. We rate the statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18632"}
