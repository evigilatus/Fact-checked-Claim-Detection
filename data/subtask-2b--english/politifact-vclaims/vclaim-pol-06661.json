Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), arguably a long-shot candidate \u2014 has served in the military.\" According to the Associated Press, Graham said in January 2015 he\u2019d set up a committee to explore running for president.\nPerry\u2019s biographical entry, on his website, says: \"Between 1972 and 1977, Perry served in the U.S. Air Force flying C-130 tactical airlift aircraft in Europe and the Middle East.\"\nAnd when the then-governor of Texas ran for president in 2012, he was nearly the only candidate with a military record, The Washington Post said in an Aug. 16, 2011, news blog post;\u00a0 the only other candidate with military experience was Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, formerly a flight surgeon in the Air Force and the Air Force National Guard.\nPaul has since left the House and the presidential hustings, seemingly giving buoyance to this new claim.\nProspects who have worn the uniform\nPerry aides did not respond to our inquiry about how Perry reached his \"only one individual\" conclusion. So we don\u2019t know why he overlooked Graham, whose time as an Air Force lawyer is mentioned in his Senate biographical entry. By email, Graham spokesman Kevin Bishop said Graham was a senior prosecutor at Rhein-Main Air Force Base in Germany from 1984-1988. He left active duty in 1989, but remains a colonel in the Air Force Reserves, Bishop said.\nIt's worth noting, too, that no candidate has already declared for president, a factor leading us to root our review of Perry's declaration in a list of Americans believed to be considering a run. The list is kept up by Politics1.com, a website run by Florida attorney Ron Gunzburger that tracks candidates for federal office.\nAnd it looks like besides Perry and Graham, a couple of possible longshot Republican hopefuls could be stumping with military experience:\n--Former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore was a U.S. Army counterintelligence agent in West Germany before entering the University of Virginia Law School, from which he graduated in 1977, according to a biographical entry posted by the National Governors Association. Gilmore\u2019s entry in Who\u2019s Who specifies \u00a0he was an Army agent in West Germany from 1971-74. In December 2014, Gilmore declined to rule out a presidential bid in an interview with The Washington Post.\n--Former United Nations Ambassador John Bolton, who like Perry spoke at the February 2015 Conservative Political Action Conference, spent time in the National Guard (signing up, he\u2019s said, because he wanted to diminish his chances of dying in a rice paddy in Vietnam). In January 2015, The Boston Globe quoted Bolton, then about to venture to New Hampshire (home to the nation\u2019s first-every-four-years presidential primaries), saying he was considering a run for president.\nDemocrat fought in Vietnam\nIn his video, Perry--who has said he\u2019ll reveal if he\u2019s running for president in May or June 2015--didn\u2019t say if he was limiting his focus to Republicans. If not, he also overlooked former Democratic Sen. Jim Webb of Virginia, who was a Marine in Vietnam before later serving as Secretary of the Navy.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWebb served in the Marine Corps from 1968 to 1972 as a second lieutenant and platoon commander in Vietnam, according to Who\u2019s Who. In a video posted online as he launched his presidential exploratory committee in November 2014, Webb said: \"I came from a family of citizen-soldiers\" including his father, a 26-year pilot. \"My brother, my son and I all became Marines. I fought on one of the Vietnam war\u2019s harshest battlefields,\" Webb said, adding that he spent eight years on active duty.\nBush to Walker to Biden to O\u2019Malley; no military service touted\nBiographical information posted online by more than a dozen other possible Republican candidates or groups didn\u2019t reveal a personal military record for former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush; surgeon Ben Carson; New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie; Texas Sen. Ted Cruz; business executive Carly Fiorina; former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee; Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal; Ohio Gov. John Kasich; former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin; Florida Sen. Marco Rubio; Indiana Gov. Mike Pence; Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul; former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum; Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder; and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker.\nSimilarly, possible Democratic aspirants--Vice President Joe Biden; former Secretary of State/former Sen. Hillary Clinton; and former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley--show no military background in their lives.\nWhat to make of all of this?\nNext, we queried a Duke University political scientist, Peter Feaver, who offered his opinion by email: \"If the field of prospects is limited to what Gov. Perry would plausibly consider to be the Republican top tier, meaning those who poll at his level or higher, then his statement is demonstrably true. None of the Republican candidates that are currently running ahead of Perry in the polls has served in uniform.\"\nFeaver continued: \"If the field of prospects is expanded to include every person who has expressed an interest in running for president, then of course some of that vast multitude have served in uniform.\"\nOur ruling\nIn a web video, Perry said: \"At this particular point in time, looking at the field, there\u2019s only one individual that\u2019s ever had the uniform of his country on\u2014and that\u2019s me.\"\nPerhaps Perry\u2019s definition of the \"field\" leaves out possible aspirants who haven\u2019t surged in early polls. We also can see Perry making a case for being the best-known possible Republican nominee with military experience. However, there are others who might bid\u2014a sitting senator, another former governor, a former ambassador and a Democratic former senator\u2014who also were in the military.\nOn balance, we rate his absolute statement Half True.\n\nHALF TRUE \u2013 The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.\nUPDATE, 5:10 p.m., March 4, 2015: We updated this story by adding details of Graham's military service, drawing on information provided by his spokesman.
