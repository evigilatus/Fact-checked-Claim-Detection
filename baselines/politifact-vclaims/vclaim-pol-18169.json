Adam Schnelting, R-St. Charles,\u00a0said he just wants the government out of the marriage business.\u00a0\n\n\nThe bill,\u00a0HB2173, which died in the House Rules Committee on March 5, also would have eliminated the mandate requiring a judge or minister to perform a ceremony solemnizing the marriage. Schnelting does not know whether he will reintroduce the bill in next year's session.\u00a0\n\n\nIn pushing the changes in a\u00a0Missouri Times op-ed\u00a0last month, Schnelting wrote \"HB2173 does not alter state or federal benefits.\"\u00a0\n\n\nWe reached out to Schnelting and asked him how it could be guaranteed that domestic unions, which have no federal definition, could qualify for federal benefits.\n\n\nSchnelting responded that contracts of domestic union are the legal equivalent of marriage and \"treats everyone equally under the law.\"\u00a0\n\n\nThat\u2019s a big claim. Our research shows it doesn\u2019t pan out.\u00a0\n\n\nThe legal difference between marriage and domestic unions\u00a0\n\n\nProblems begin with the phrase \"domestic union.\"\u00a0\n\n\nThe state and federal governments define marriage as a legal contract between two spouses. That contract opens the door to an expansive list of federal benefits including Social Security, Medicare, joint tax returns and employment benefits.\u00a0\n\n\nSchnelting and his bill define a domestic union as the legal equivalent of marriage. But there is no other state that recognizes that term.\u00a0\n\n\nSo, let\u2019s consider alternatives: Groups that condemn the bill for undermining marriage equality such as the Missouri chapter of The American Civil Liberties Union and\u00a0PROMO, an LGBTQ advocacy group, have focused on existing terminology of \"domestic partnerships\" and\u00a0 \"civil unions.\"\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepublican Party of Texas\n\n\nstated on December 2, 2009 in in a Web ad\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Bill White is for gay marriage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 12, 2010\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth include two individuals who consistently live together and have a personal relationship. These marriage-alternative unions were often utilized by same- sex couples seeking legal benefits prior to the 2015 Supreme Court ruling.\u00a0\n\n\nUnlike marriage, civil unions and domestic partnerships are not recognized in all 50 states. They are also not recognized by the federal government and thus are not eligible for most federal benefits.\n\n\nIn states where domestic partnerships and civil unions are recognized, individuals can receive benefits that parallel those of marriage such as healthcare benefits from employers. These benefits differ greatly by state.\u00a0\n\n\nFollowing the Supreme Court ruling, several states including New Hampshire, Delaware and Connecticut converted all civil unions into marriages.\n\n\nDomestic unions, like civil unions and domestic partnerships, are not recognized under federal law, so eligibility for federal benefits depends on the state.\u00a0\n\n\nFor example, the\u00a0United States Social Security Administration\u2019s website\u00a0states it recognizes \"some\" civil unions and domestic partnerships for determining entitlement\u00a0 to Medicare, Social Security and Social Security Income. However, it recognizes marriages in all states.\n\n\nThe Department of State also does not consider individuals in domestic partnerships or civil unions as spouses for immigration purposes.\u00a0\n\n\nAdditionally, the\u00a0Internal Revenue Service\u00a0does not consider civil unions or domestic partnerships as married for purposes of federal tax benefits. These marriage alternative unions cannot apply for joint tax returns.\u00a0\n\n\nSo what about state benefits?\n\n\nWe couldn\u2019t find any example of marriage benefits specific to Missouri that would be affected.\u00a0\n\n\nOur ruling\u00a0\n\n\nSchnelting wrote that replacing marriage licenses with domestic union contracts\u00a0\"does not alter state or federal benefits.\"\n\n\nWhile domestic unions could be recognized in Missouri as legally equivalent to marriage, there is no guarantee that the other states would recognize the union, or the dissolution of the union as such. And, with no federal definition, there is also nothing in federal law qualifying domestic unions for the expansive list of spousal benefits, privileges and rights. \u00a0\n\n\nWith that, we rate this claim Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18169"}
