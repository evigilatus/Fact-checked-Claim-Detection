Allen voiced frustration with the Obama administration\u2019s refusal to allow oil and natural gas leases off Virginia\u2019s coast.\n\n\"Our federal government has lent $2 billion to the state-owned oil company of Brazil to allow them to explore for oil and gas, and that shows how contradictory our energy policies are,\" Allen said.\n\nIs the U.S. really financing $2 billion worth of off-shore energy production in Brazil?\n\nTo back the claim, the Allen campaign emailed postings from several websites, including Forbes Magazine. Our research, however, shows that some of the information in the articles was loosely interpreted by Allen, and some of the information was inaccurate.\n\nAll of the articles center on a tentative offer by the Export-Import Bank of the United States in April 2009 to provide up to $2 billion in financing to Petrobras, Brazil\u2019s national oil company.\n\nThe Export-Import Bank\u00a0is an independent federal agency that provides financing options -- including direct loans, guarantees of loans and \u00a0export-credit insurance -- to foreign buyers to help them purchase U.S. goods and services. \u00a0\n\nThe bank, as noted in a September story\u00a0by PolitiFact\u2019s national staff, receives its spending authority from Congress but gets no appropriated funds. It operates using revenues from the fees and interest that it charges lenders and borrowers, although its transactions are ultimately backed by the U.S. government\u2019s faith and credit. The bank is allowed to have up to $100 billion in outstanding loans.\n\nWe called Ex-Im Bank\u2019s spokesman, Phil Cogan, and asked him to assess Allen\u2019s statement.\n\n\"It is not correct,\" he said.\n\nEx-Im\u2019s tentative agreement was an \"expression of the bank\u2019s willingness\" to consider up to $2 billion in loan applications from Petrobras to finance its purchase of U.S. goods and supplies. All five of the bank\u2019s board of directors who approved the decision were appointed by former President George W. Bush, a Republican.\n\nOn Feb. 4, 2010, the Ex-Im Bank agreed to guarantee a $308 million private loan to Petrobras made by JPMorgan Chase. The loan guarantee is helping Petrobras purchase goods and services from about 150 U.S. companies, according to Cogan.\n\nThere were no other financial transactions between Ex-Im and Petrobras before their preliminary loan agreement expired in April 2011. Cogan said it has not been renewed.\n\nSo Ex-Im did not directly lend any money to Petrobras, let alone the\u00a0$2 billion Allen claimed. All it did was back a $308 million loan that a private bank made to the Brazilian oil company.\n\nDan Allen, a senior adviser to the Allen campaign, told us George Allen should not be faulted for making a mistake about Ex-Im and Petrobras. He said George Allen based his statement on information published by credible news sources.\n\n\"We just didn\u2019t come up with the stuff and throw it against the wall,\" Dan Allen said. \"We relied on something published on Forbes magazine\u2019s website.\"\n\nHe referred us to a May 2011 posting\u00a0headlined \"Petrobras to Tap Ex-Im Loan `Soon.\u2019\" The Forbes article, however, appears to be referring to the closing of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s loan to Petrobras that Ex-Im guaranteed.\n\nDan Allen also sent us an article\u00a0that ran this August in The Hill, a publication that covers Congress. That story, however, never said a $2 billion loan had been made. It merely noted that \"Republicans railed against a 2009 proposed $2 billion commitment from the U.S. Import-Export Bank to the Brazilian oil company Petrobras.\"\n\nDifferent claims about about the loan have been circulated over the last two years by conservative voices such as\u00a0The Wall Street Journal editorial\u00a0page, Fox News\u00a0and\u00a0Gov. Rick Perry, R-Texas.\n\nSeeking to counter misinformation, Ex-Im has posted a website fact sheet\u00a0about its relationship with Petrobras. The bank takes exception to statements by Allen and others that the dealings reflect inconsistent federal policies on off-shore drilling.\n\n\"There is no connection between the federal policies on offshore drilling in U.S. waters and financing U.S. export sales by other countries,\" the fact sheet says. \"In fact, should Ex-Im Bank refuse to finance sales by U.S. companies it is likely that the sales will go instead to their foreign competitors.\"\n\nOur conclusion:\n\nAllen says the U.S. government lent $2 billion to Petrobras, the state-owned oil company of Brazil.\n\nHe is referring to a preliminary agreement by the U.S. Export-Import Bank, an independent federal agency, to consider offering up to $2 billion in financing to help Petrobras buy American goods and services.\n\nIn 2010, Ex-Im agreed to guarantee a $308 million private loan made to Petrobras by JPMorgan Chase. There were no other transactions, and Ex-Im\u2019s agreement with Petrobras expired this April.\n\nThe bottom line is that that Ex-Im did not directly lend any money to Petrobras. We rate Allen\u2019s statement False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11951"}
