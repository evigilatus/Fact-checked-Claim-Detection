An ad from the company asks: \"Do you know that most all mills in Oregon have retooled over the past 20 years?\"", "truth_label": "true", "date": "stated on March 2, 2014 in newspaper ads:", "title": "Have 'most all' Oregon sawmills retooled over the past 20 years?", "text": "A good way to get an argument roaring louder than a chain saw is to bring up Northwest forest policy. Topics ranging from clear-cutting to what constitutes \"old growth\" are bound to spark tussles.\nForestry issues are again in the news as U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and other members of the state\u2019s congressional delegation pitch plans to increase harvest levels from the so-called O&C lands -- 2.4 million acres of federally owned forestlands sprawled across 18 western Oregon counties.\nMany are watching closely, knowing decisions coming out of Washington, D.C., could have controversial implications for Oregon.\nAmong those following the debate are Aaron Jones\u2019 three daughters. Jones opened his Seneca Jones sawmill in Eugene more than 60 years ago.\nBecky, Kathy and Jody Jones are taking out newspaper ads touting the benefits of \"forestry stewardship,\" among other things.\nAn ad that ran in Oregon newspapers, including The Oregonian, on March 2, 2014, presses for more timber harvests and seeks to allay fears that old growth will be cut. It says mills are now focused on second-generation trees, and claims: \"Do you know that most all mills in Oregon have retooled over the past 20 years?\" We revved up our saw and checked.\nWe called Kathy Jones. She said the ads are aimed at influencing the debate over O&C lands, which could yield increased timber for Oregon sawmills.\n\"Some people keep saying we are ruining the forests, that we are cutting old growth at every opportunity,\" Jones said. \"It\u2019s just not true. What is true is that almost every mill still operating in Oregon has retooled to accept second-growth logs.\n\"And I\u2019m fine with that. I love those big cathedral forests. They should stay just as they are.\"\nJones said her definition of old growth begins when a tree\u2019s diameter reaches 48 inches. The logs Seneca accepts average about 30 inches, she said.\nAs for Seneca\u2019s own retooling efforts, Jones said lasers now scan all incoming logs. Computers tell operators what sizes of studs and other lumber are most in demand at the moment, and the cutting begins.\n\"We have almost as many computer operators as we do people out on the floor,\" Jones said. \"That\u2019s how this industry operates these days.\"\nWe called Paul Barnum, executive director of the Oregon Forest Resources Institute. The Legislature created the group in 1991 to bring forest scientists, public agencies, forest landowners and community and conservation groups together.\nBarnum referred us to a 2012 report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Pacific Northwest Research Station.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViral image\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Portland\u2019s mayor after demonstrations there \u201curging him to stick to the proven Democratic Play book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA chapter assessing Oregon\u2019s sawmill sector said, in part, \"Technological improvements have made Oregon mills more efficient in numerous ways. Log size (diameter and length) sensing capabilities linked to computer determine the best sawing pattern for logs to recover either the greatest volume or greatest value from each other.\"\nWe asked Barnum about the Seneca Jones claim.\n\"There may be three or four mills that still process old-growth timber, which comes pretty much from private forestlands,\" he said. \"The mills still operating have retooled to concentrate on getting more value from second- and third-generation timber.\"\nBarnum also passed along a report from Paul F. Ehinger & Associates, which said that in 2010 -- the last time the numbers were updated -- Oregon had 106 operating sawmills.\nFor another view, we called Steve Pedery, conservation director at Oregon Wild. The group has long fought clear-cutting and old-growth harvesting, but has won U.S. Forest Service awards in recent years for helping design timber-restoration sales.\nPedery passed along an Oregon Wild report detailing nine westside mills that still accept large logs. \"What this highlights,\" he said, \"is that there is still an appetite for old growth out there. If they could get it, they would.\"\nRegarding the retooling claim, he said: \"Saying \u2018most\u2019 misses the point of the policy debate. There are still mills looking for large-diameter trees and they are all in southwest Oregon, where the remaining big trees are.\"\nOne of the mills in the report, D.R. Johnson Lumber in Riddle, is currently mothballed, according to both the report and an employee who answered our call there.\nAnother listed as accepting large-diameter logs is Rough & Ready Lumber Co. in Cave Junction. Coincidentally, that operation announced this month that it will soon reopen a retooled small-log mill that\u2019s been closed since last year.\n\"Unless you are a real niche operation looking for the occasional large log that comes along, you\u2019ve retooled,\" said co-owner Jennifer Phillippi, whose grandfather founded Rough and Ready 92 years ago. \"You wouldn\u2019t still be in business otherwise.\"\nThe ruling\nThe owners of Seneca Jones sawmill in Eugene want harvest levels from federally managed O&C lands increased but with primarily second- and third-generation trees. They say the timber industry agrees, adding, \"Most all mills in Oregon have retooled over the past 20 years\" to accept smaller trees.\nA key environmental group maintains that old-growth cutting would commence if rules pertaining to federal lands are changed. The ongoing debate over timber policy in Washington, D.C., will determine whether they are.\nBut we can look at the numbers, which show that of the 106 or so mills in Oregon, only a handful have not retooled and still look to buy large-diameter logs.\nThe overwhelming majority, according to a forestry group created by the Legislature, use machinery that\u2019s been added in recent years to accept smaller logs. It bears out the assertion that \"most all\" sawmills have retooled.\nWe rate the claim True.\nReturn to OregonLive.com/politics to comment on this ruling.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08134"}
