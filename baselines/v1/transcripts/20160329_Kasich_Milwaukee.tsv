0001	COOPER	And welcome back.
0002	COOPER	There is history all around us here at downtown Milwaukees Riverside Theater, which opened in 1928.
0003	COOPER	It was nearly destroyed by fire in 1966.
0004	COOPER	It was lovingly restored in the 80s and has been at the heart of this citys cultural life ever since.
0005	COOPER	It is a magnificent theater.
0006	COOPER	Were here in the mid of a historymaking Republican presidential campaign, bringing voters face to face with the candidates, showcasing their questions and bringing it all to you at home.
0007	COOPER	Joining us now is Ohios governor, John Kasich.
0008	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0009	KASICH	How are you?
0010	COOPER	Good to see you.
0011	COOPER	Have a seat.
0012	COOPER	All right, we got a lot of questions from the audience about a lot of policy issues.
0013	COOPER	A couple of questions on news of the day.
0014	COOPER	Donald Trumps campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, charged today with simple battery.
0015	COOPER	Would you fire him?
0016	KASICH	Well, I havent seen the video, but they tell me the video is real.
0017	KASICH	Of course I would.
0018	KASICH	Look, when you have problems like that, you have to act.
0019	KASICH	Now, Ive been of course an executive running the seventhlargest state.
0020	KASICH	And we see things that happen.
0021	KASICH	At times, you want to give people the benefit of the doubt, but when you see things that are pretty clear  from what I understand the video is clear.
0022	KASICH	Of course would fire him.
0023	COOPER	Lets talk about your path to the nomination.
0024	COOPER	You are pinning your hopes on a contested convention.
0025	COOPER	Assuming there is one, why would you be selected?
0026	COOPER	Youve only won one state, your home state, Ohio.
0027	COOPER	Why would you get the nomination?
0028	KASICH	Well, a couple of reasons, Anderson.
0029	KASICH	First of all, in virtually every national poll, I am the only one that beats Hillary Clinton consistently.
0030	KASICH	In fact, in the last poll that came out I was up 11 points.
0031	KASICH	Secondly, and, you know, delegates would look, for example, at, you know, can you win in the fall?
0032	KASICH	I mean, its like a really important part of this thing, its not just the nomination, its about winning the election.
0033	KASICH	And frankly, if we do not have a strong candidate that brings people together, we have a prospect of losing the United States Senate as well.
0034	KASICH	And secondly, Anderson, at some point that people that go to a convention are going to be concerned about who actually could run the country.
0035	KASICH	I mean, its like a big deal.
0036	KASICH	You know, who could be president, who could be commanderinchief?
0037	KASICH	And I have more experience than really all of them put together except for Mrs. Clinton.
0038	KASICH	I mean, I have  you know, I served 18 years on the defense  Armed Services Committee, I was in the Pentagon after 911.
0039	KASICH	I was chairman of the Budget Committee.
0040	KASICH	I was involved in welfare reform.
0041	KASICH	When I was chairman of the Budget Committee, we balanced the budget, we had job growth.
0042	KASICH	Ive been the executive in Ohio.
0043	KASICH	Weve grown jobs.
0044	KASICH	So at some point people are going to look at two things, who can win in the fall, and secondly who could be the best president?
0045	COOPER	But polls are one thing, though, I mean, to have only won  if it continues on this path, to have only won one state, your home state, wont some delegates say, look, OK, the polls say he can win in a headtohead matchup against Hillary Clinton, but the voters have spoken.
0046	KASICH	Well, Anderson, I think its pretty clear and most of the people in here I think would agree with this, for most of the debates, I was completely ignored.
0047	KASICH	I mean, it has been like the last three weeks to a month that people have started to pay attention to who I am and my message.
0048	KASICH	And it has fundamentally happened that way because Ive not gotten down in the mud.
0049	KASICH	I havent namecalled.
0050	KASICH	I havent had all these nasty sound bites.
0051	KASICH	Ive just been laying out my record and my vision for what I want to see happen.
0052	KASICH	But conventions are very interesting.
0053	KASICH	Republicans have had 10 conventions.
0054	KASICH	And the leader going into the convention has only been the nominee three times out of 10.
0055	KASICH	Seven times out of 10 they were not.
0056	KASICH	So I think  and were going to do better as this calendar moves to the east.
0057	KASICH	Look, now Im starting to get on my home court, you know,  look, I went to Ohio, I won by 11 points.
0058	KASICH	You know, I did very, well there.
0059	KASICH	Were going to go to Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut.
0060	KASICH	These are all places where I can do extremely well.
0061	KASICH	And we will continue to accumulate delegates.
0062	KASICH	And well have momentum going into the convention.
0063	KASICH	And by the way, the convention is nothing more than an extension of the process we have going now.
0064	KASICH	Somehow people think theyre truncated somehow, theyre disjointed.
0065	KASICH	Theyre not.
0066	KASICH	Its a process of primaries.
0067	KASICH	You accumulate delegates.
0068	KASICH	You go to the convention.
0069	KASICH	And then they pick the nominees.
0070	COOPER	I want to ask you about terrorism.
0071	COOPER	When you were asked about what happened in Brussels last week  or lets talk about that.
0072	COOPER	In terms of what U.S. response should and what the fight against ISIS should look like, you said yesterday that one of the opponents wants to make the sand glow and the other one complains about other countries not doing enough, obviously you were talking about Senator Cruz and Mr. Trump.
0073	COOPER	Why would America be safer under your watch?
0074	KASICH	Well, Anderson, first of all, Ive been saying for a long time and laid out an extensive program on rebuilding the military.
0075	KASICH	Secondly, Ive been the one arguing all along that we need to go after ISIS in a coalition like we had in the first Gulf War.
0076	KASICH	I was there when I saw it happen.
0077	KASICH	I saw our Muslim Arab friends join us in the West, and we pushed Saddam out of Kuwait.
0078	KASICH	You know, secondly, that same coalition needs come together and we need to destroy ISIS both in the air and on the ground, settle it down and then come home.
0079	KASICH	And let the regional powers draw the map.
0080	COOPER	There are a lot of countries, Saudi Arabia, that dont necessarily see ISIS as their predominant threat.
0081	KASICH	Oh, no, no, no.
0082	KASICH	Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, the Gulf states, they all know its an existential threat.
0083	KASICH	They know that they  that the kingdom hangs by a thread because of the radicalism of ISIS.
0084	KASICH	And so the fact is they will join us.
0085	KASICH	They joined us before against Saddam Hussein.
0086	KASICH	That was not as big of a deal as this is where theyre blowing people up all over the world.
0087	KASICH	Secondly, of course, I think, Anderson, that we need really good worldwide intelligence.
0088	KASICH	I think that the lemons were seeing can be turned into lemonade and I think a president of the United States can rally the civilized world to destroy these folks who are intent on destroying us.
0089	KASICH	And secondly, we talked about NATO.
0090	KASICH	That was another thing I talked about.
0091	KASICH	We need to change NATO from not just a military organization, but an intelligencegathering and also a policing organization that works across boundaries.
0092	KASICH	All of us together, fighting together, working together, destroy ISIS, have the good human intelligence
0093	COOPER	Donald Trump says NATO is obsolete.
0094	COOPER	Is it?
0095	KASICH	Well, of course its not.
0096	KASICH	Thats absurd, obsolete, OK?
0097	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0098	KASICH	Now, look, its really important that we get these countries to pitch in and do more.
0099	KASICH	Theyll never do as much as we want.
0100	KASICH	I mean, I lived through a whole time when we would push them, pressure them.
0101	KASICH	Part of the problem is its their governments over there.
0102	KASICH	You know, there is too much socialism, there is too much political correctness.
0103	KASICH	Thats why they didnt even catch this thing in Brussels.
0104	KASICH	And you know that the screwups that we saw with the intelligence.
0105	KASICH	But heres the thing no, NATO has an additional role now.
0106	KASICH	And that is policing and intelligence gathering.
0107	KASICH	You see, we need to have the Muslims working with us and the West 
0108	COOPER	Thats critical?
0109	KASICH	Absolutely critical.
0110	KASICH	Let me tell you, Anderson, if we wanted to get information out of some radical thats in a mosque  youre a really great guy, but if you were three blocks from the mosque, do you think youd get anything?
0111	COOPER	I dont blend very well.
0112	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0113	KASICH	No, you are dont.
0114	KASICH	Well, the fact is is that we want the Muslims who are  they feel as strongly as we do about these murderers out there.
0115	KASICH	These Muslims, theyre the ones that have to police their own neighborhoods.
0116	KASICH	And, frankly, we need the imams to come out and issue statements about how their religion has been hijacked.
0117	KASICH	But it takes all of us together.
0118	KASICH	It takes us to have great human intelligence.
0119	KASICH	And here in the United States weve got counterterrorism task forces made up of the FBI, its made up of Homeland Security, state and local law enforcement, and their job is to disrupt.
0120	KASICH	Thats why the issue of Apple was so important because they need the resources to be able to carry out their job for all of us, but they need one other thing they need the tools.
0121	KASICH	And if they cant hear, then it becomes a problem.
0122	KASICH	But theres also a role for us.
0123	KASICH	Because when we see something happening in our neighborhood, Anderson, we have an obligation to alert authorities as well.
0124	COOPER	You talked about Donald Trump belittle  in an interview today, you said about Donald Trumps foreign, I think thats the most ridiculous of foreign policy I ever heard.
0125	COOPER	This is just somebody that just doesnt understand foreign policy.
0126	COOPER	Just doesnt 
0127	KASICH	Well which part was I talking about?
0128	KASICH	I dont remember.
0129	COOPER	Im not sure either.
0130	KASICH	OK. Well, I mean, I think the idea that  Ill tell you one.
0131	COOPER	Do you think he 
0132	KASICH	Were going to have a religious test on who comes in the country.
0133	KASICH	So, when you come in the country, I say, well, are you a Muslim?
0134	KASICH	Raise your hand if youre a Muslim.
0135	KASICH	I mean, come on, Anderson.
0136	KASICH	Thats not going to work.
0137	KASICH	Were not going to police Muslim neighborhoods.
0138	KASICH	We cant afford polarization of people who are in the civilized world.
0139	KASICH	You know, there are people all over the world that know that this threat has to be stopped.
0140	KASICH	It has to be destroyed, and we have to work together as a world.
0141	KASICH	Because when people in Pakistan die, we all die a little bit when they blow up innocent men, women and children at an Easter service.
0142	KASICH	I mean, the world understands this.
0143	KASICH	And this is an opportunity for us to be brought together.
0144	KASICH	The president, by the way, went to a baseball game in Cuba instead of coming home, meeting.
0145	KASICH	Ill tell you what I would do if I were president.
0146	KASICH	I would come home, I would call world leaders.
0147	KASICH	I would gather my military and intelligence experts.
0148	KASICH	I would find out our vulnerabilities, and I would send them to Europe.
0149	KASICH	And I would say, let us look at what our problems are, and lets fix them immediately.
0150	COOPER	The response of the White House is often to that criticism 
0151	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0152	COOPER	The response of the White House to that criticism, and I want you to be able to respond to it, is often, well, look.
0153	COOPER	By changing the presidents schedule, it gives power to the terrorist group that theyre able to change the leader of the free world s schedule and that he can do the work he needs to do on wherever location hes at.
0154	KASICH	So you kind of go to a baseball game, and you dont come home?
0155	COOPER	Well, thats another issue.
0156	KASICH	And  no, heres the situation.
0157	KASICH	That attack was in the heart of Europe.
0158	KASICH	I mean, that was an attack on the very heart of our friends who live in Europe.
0159	KASICH	Yes, I think its important enough to come home.
0160	KASICH	Secondly 
0161	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0162	KASICH	 Ill give you another one that I cant believe.
0163	KASICH	The president of the United States  the first thing he did is he wouldnt meet with our friend Netanyahu.
0164	KASICH	OK, that was the first meeting he snubbed.
0165	KASICH	Now, hes snubbed another one.
0166	KASICH	Hes snubbed a meeting with the president of Turkey.
0167	KASICH	Do you know how important it is for to us have good relations with Turkey?
0168	KASICH	Theyre the gateway to the East.
0169	KASICH	Now, Erdogan is doing some things that none of us like.
0170	KASICH	But you know what?
0171	KASICH	We have to deal with him.
0172	KASICH	He is the one that alerted the Europeans about the radical that was moving over to Brussels.
0173	KASICH	You have to be able to manage this.
0174	KASICH	And I tell you, its complicated, it takes sophistication.
0175	KASICH	And you need to have good advisers.
0176	KASICH	But Ill tell you what else you need.
0177	KASICH	You need experience, and you need a good gut.
0178	KASICH	And Ive been involved in these things for almost all of my adult lifetime.
0179	KASICH	So, I have advisers, but I dont have many teachers.
0180	KASICH	I understand most of these things.
0181	COOPER	Weve talked about Trumps campaign manager.
0182	COOPER	Your campaign manager tweeted this just a couple of hours ago.
0183	COOPER	Quote, Cruz with zero friends, zero record, zero vision, zero chance decides to lie about @JohnKasich.
0184	COOPER	Desperate?
0185	COOPER	Trump right on one thing, lying Ted.
0186	COOPER	Does this signal any kind of a new phase 
0187	KASICH	No, I didnt know he  you know, because sometimes he gets a little tweet happy, and I dont like that, OK?
0188	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0189	KASICH	And I will have a word with him about it.
0190	KASICH	But let me say  that look.
0191	KASICH	The Cruz campaign, their super PAC is spending a half a billion (sic) to $800,000 against me in Wisconsin.
0192	KASICH	I mean, they say, well, Kasich doesnt have any strength out here.
0193	KASICH	Usually, if you dont have any strength, they dont spend $500,000 to $800,000 attacking you.
0194	KASICH	And you know, the attacks are  look.
0195	KASICH	Arnold Schwarzenegger told me in 2010 when I was running for governor, I was saying, Arnold, theyre really beating me up.
0196	KASICH	He looked at me and said, John, love the beatings. Okay, thats part of politics, and Ive learned to love the beatings.
0197	KASICH	But I mean, the fact is, is that they are hammering me, and theyre not hammering Trump.
0198	KASICH	Its very interesting.
0199	KASICH	But thats okay I can take it.
0200	COOPER	In terms of tone and tenor of the campaign, your two fellow candidates have obviously been duking it out over the last week or so
0201	KASICH	The last week or so?
0202	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0203	KASICH	How about the last five months?
0204	KASICH	Where you been, Anderson?
0205	COOPER	In this new phase on the whole
0206	KASICH	Thats why Im not in the news.
0207	KASICH	I didnt call anybody a name.
0208	KASICH	And you know what, Im in the going to take the low road to the highest office in the land.
0209	KASICH	Im not going to do it.
0210	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0211	COOPER	Thats my question.
0212	COOPER	That was my question, which was, what does it look like from the sidelines when you watch this?
0213	KASICH	Ill tell you, sometimes its amazing to me.
0214	KASICH	Sometimes when I look at it I think, what the heck are we doing here?
0215	KASICH	You know, I was on a radio talk show with some guy here, Jay somebody or other, I dont remember this morning  yes, whatever his name is.
0216	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0217	KASICH	Nice guy.
0218	KASICH	Nice guy.
0219	KASICH	And he was  and even yesterday I was on a different one, and a guy says to me, well, you know, maybe this is the new politics.
0220	KASICH	If name calling, bringing in spouses and ripping each other below the belt and wrestling in the mud is the new politics, we all need to stand against it.
0221	KASICH	Our children are watching.
0222	KASICH	This is America.
0223	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0224	KASICH	We need to talk about what were for.
0225	KASICH	And I have been consistent.
0226	KASICH	Now, when they say something on policywise thats bad, of course Im going to say something about it, but I dont want to go down into  Im not going to go down there.
0227	KASICH	I hope not.
0228	KASICH	I could screw up but I hope not.
0229	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0230	COOPER	Lets go to our audience for some issues (ph).
0231	COOPER	Jim Vogel (ph) is here.
0232	COOPER	He works in advertising.
0233	COOPER	He says hes leaning right now towards Senator Cruz.
0234	COOPER	Jim, welcome.
0235	QUESTION	Hi, governor.
0236	QUESTION	In Ohio you accepted Medicaid expansion and you took on the  Im sorry, the health care exchanges and it was to help the poor.
0237	QUESTION	Here in Wisconsin we used  Governor Walker used BadgerCare to essentially provide the same services at the same levels, and yet we did it without creating a whole new entitlement program and expanding federal debt.
0238	QUESTION	Why did you choose Obamacare?
0239	QUESTION	Why did you choose the Washingtonbased solution?
0240	QUESTION	And why cant you guys ever look at some other source other than Washington for these solutions?
0241	KASICH	Okay, let me say a couple of things.
0242	KASICH	First of all, its not so simple what Governor Walker did here.
0243	KASICH	If you look at it, its more complicated.
0244	KASICH	And by the way, today the Milwaukee JournalSentinel endorsed me for president of the United States saying Im the guy that is a pragmatic conservative that can get things done.
0245	KASICH	I was really appreciative of that endorsement.
0246	KASICH	But look, I took a Medicaid program that was growing at 10 12 percent, and in my second year as governor it grew at 2 12 percent, without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one benefit.
0247	KASICH	How did I do it?
0248	KASICH	I brought innovation to the system.
0249	KASICH	Now I then had a choice.
0250	KASICH	Now that my program was under control, I then had a choice.
0251	KASICH	Could I bring money back, which is frankly our money, Ohio money, back to Ohio to solve some of our problems.
0252	KASICH	Let me tell what you weve done.
0253	KASICH	I dont believe the mentally ill ought to be sleeping under a bridge or living in prison.
0254	KASICH	It costs $22,500 a year to put them in prison.
0255	KASICH	If I can get their medication and get them on their feet and if get they can get a job, they become taxpayers.
0256	KASICH	We save money.
0257	KASICH	Secondly, I believe that the drug addicted in our prisons should be treated, because we dont want a revolving door of in and out of the prisons, because that costs $22,500 a year, and we also are throwing a life down the drain.
0258	KASICH	So guess what, because of our program now in the prisons and with the community, we have an 80 percent success rate in not having people go back in, and our recidivism rate is 27 percent.
0259	KASICH	And, by the way, were running a $2 billion surplus.
0260	KASICH	We dont put our budget together with scotch tap and bail and wire  were running a $2 million surplus.
0261	KASICH	Were managing it all.
0262	KASICH	So where are we?
0263	KASICH	Where we are in Ohio, is we are not treating the mentally ill, the drug addicted, the working poor, theyre in a better position, theyre not in our prisons, and at the same time, theyre getting on their feet, theyre becoming taxpayers and our Medicaid program is completely under control.
0264	KASICH	And by the way, I reject Obamacare, and I did not go along with the exchange that they were trying to force on me, because I never knew what the heck was going to come of it.
0265	KASICH	I actually have a solid health care plan to replace Obamacare, which involves transparency, competition, marketoriented forces.
0266	KASICH	Were actually doing it in my state, and Id like to spread it all across the country.
0267	KASICH	So the idea of doing that was not only compassionate, but it also made good economic sense for our state and its working out quite well.
0268	COOPER	Thank you for your question.
0269	COOPER	Governor, I want you too meet,this is Julie Grace.
0270	COOPER	Shes a student at Marquette University
0271	KASICH	You know what, just one other thing I wanted to say.
0272	KASICH	You understand that I spent 10 years of my life fighting to balance the budget.
0273	KASICH	And we got it balanced.
0274	KASICH	Senator Domenici and I worked with the Clinton administration.
0275	KASICH	We got the budget balanced four years in a row.
0276	KASICH	It hadnt been balanced since man walked on the moon, hasnt been balanced since.
0277	KASICH	And when I left Washington, there was a $5 trillion surplus, and guess who spent it?
0278	KASICH	The Republicans.
0279	KASICH	Now, sir, you have to stand in the breach when youre a leader.
0280	KASICH	And what I did in Washington in getting that budget under control, and seeing it liftoff in jobs, and what Ive done in Ohio, were now up 417,000 jobs in Ohio from a downturn of when I came in of 350,000.
0281	KASICH	And weve cut taxes by more than any governor in the country, including your governor.
0282	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0283	COOPER	All right.
0284	COOPER	I want you to meet Julie Grace, shes a student at Marquette University.
0285	KASICH	But thank you.
0286	COOPER	And she said shes supporting you.
0287	KASICH	Oh, you are?
0288	QUESTION	I am.
0289	KASICH	Good.
0290	KASICH	OK. Say something really, really good.
0291	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0292	QUESTION	Ill try.
0293	QUESTION	So in Europe many far right conservative parties, antiimmigrant parties have been gaining momentum recently, specifically Germany, Sweden, France, and Britain.
0294	QUESTION	Do you think a similar movement is occurring here in the U.S.?
0295	QUESTION	And if so, how can the Republican Party address this?
0296	KASICH	Weve gone through periods of time in our history when we have turned against immigration.
0297	KASICH	It has happened.
0298	KASICH	And these movement have sprung up.
0299	KASICH	Look, we have to  young lady, we have to protect the border.
0300	KASICH	That is a given, OK?
0301	KASICH	For a couple of reasons, and one of them is security.
0302	KASICH	So we have to get the border done.
0303	KASICH	And secondly, we should have a guest worker program where people can come in and work, and then they can go back home, because thats what they want to do.
0304	KASICH	And thirdly, if they came here illegally but theyve not committed a crime since theyve been here, theyll pay a fine, back taxes, and they can have a path to legalization, not a path to citizenship.
0305	KASICH	Now the idea that were going to drive around in Waukesha and were going to drive around here in Milwaukee, and were going to yank people out of their homes, leaving their kids on the front porch crying and screaming?
0306	KASICH	Come on, thats ridiculous, OK?
0307	KASICH	Call it what it is, its ridiculous.
0308	KASICH	But we can get the border fixed.
0309	KASICH	We can have a guest worker program.
0310	KASICH	We can get a path to legalization, not let anybody else come.
0311	KASICH	You have got to go back, no excuses.
0312	KASICH	And you want to know what I think?
0313	KASICH	I think that can pass.
0314	KASICH	I think that can pass the United States Congress.
0315	KASICH	And I think it can pass with the American people and get this issue behind us and get this thing healed.
0316	KASICH	We need a healing in America.
0317	KASICH	And stop kicking cans down the road and solve problems in this country.
0318	KASICH	And I think thats a reasonable solution to this problem of immigration.
0319	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0320	COOPER	Thank you for your question.
0321	COOPER	This is Asa White, hes a student also, says hes leaning towards supporting Donald Trump right now.
0322	COOPER	Asa, welcome.
0323	QUESTION	Thank you.
0324	QUESTION	My question  the most recent terrorist attack in Brussels has highlighted a big issue we have with our attack on foreign terrorism.
0325	QUESTION	That is, we now have neighborhoods that are being deemed as terrorist hotbeds.
0326	QUESTION	Do you support Senator Cruzs  when he says we should go into Muslim neighborhoods and patrol them?
0327	KASICH	No, I dont support that at all.
0328	KASICH	I think its ridiculous.
0329	KASICH	And you know what?
0330	KASICH	The guy who was the best police guy in the whole country, he understands policing, is a guy named Bill Bratton.
0331	KASICH	Hes now currently the police chief in New York.
0332	KASICH	He was the police chief under Rudy Giuliani.
0333	KASICH	He was the head of the metro system in Boston.
0334	KASICH	And he ran the Los Angeles Police Department.
0335	KASICH	He is absolutely the best.
0336	KASICH	He said that plan is ridiculous.
0337	KASICH	And let me just tell you, sir, we all want to catch these bad guys.
0338	KASICH	And I know how it works because Ive got Joint Terrorism Task Force members who are in my state, theyre in your state.
0339	KASICH	We need to hear whats happening in the community.
0340	KASICH	So let me just  let me ask you this question.
0341	KASICH	If all of a sudden we start trying to pinpoint you  we have a religious test, were going to now patrol your neighborhood and your home because we suspect, even though youre as lawabiding as anybody else in the country.
0342	KASICH	Now I want you to help me find out who the bad guys are.
0343	KASICH	I mean, come on, that doesnt make any sense that if we polarize the entire Muslim community, how are we going to get the information we want?
0344	KASICH	We want Muslims who go to mosques who see radicalization to tell the authorities about it.
0345	KASICH	Because I have got to tell you, the vast, vast, vast majority of Muslims, they think their religion has been hijacked, that we have murderers out there who have distorted their religion.
0346	KASICH	And they want to stop had as much as we want to stop it.
0347	KASICH	So the fact is lets isolate those people who are the killers and lets work together as a community of civilized people to take the battle to them.
0348	KASICH	Destroy ISIS, thats a given, and then after that great intelligence to make sure we can thwart these attacks and get the Europeans to start, you know, paying attention and doing their job.
0349	KASICH	I mean, thats what I think we need to do, sir.
0350	KASICH	So thank you.
0351	COOPER	Thank you for your question.
0352	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0353	KASICH	This is Jim Walker.
0354	KASICH	Hes a Republican from Franklin, Wisconsin.
0355	KASICH	He said hes leaning towards Ted Cruz for his experience, but likes you because you run a bluecollar state.
0356	KASICH	Jim, welcome.
0357	QUESTION	Thank you very much, Anderson.
0358	QUESTION	And welcome to the great state of Wisconsin, governor.
0359	QUESTION	I represent a manufacturer, farm equipment manufacturer, here in Wisconsin that directly employs many thousands of people.
0360	QUESTION	Indirectly, as you can imagine, with farm equipment that we sell, we indirectly support many more thousand farmers who buy our equipment.
0361	QUESTION	On top of that we export about a third of our product that we manufacture here in essence.
0362	QUESTION	So in essence, were a global manufacturing company.
0363	QUESTION	To spark a war right now would not only be detrimental to business, but all of those people directly and indirectly that I said we support.
0364	QUESTION	My question to you is, as president, how would you engage in diplomacy that wont hurt global manufacturing businesses?
0365	KASICH	Yes, number one, I want you to know, sir, that in my state now, we have over 63,000 new manufacturing jobs.
0366	KASICH	Its really cool that  and were paying attention to all the sectors, which we need to do as a nation.
0367	KASICH	Lets talk about trade for a second.
0368	KASICH	Its a tough issue.
0369	KASICH	One out of five Americans work for something related to trade, and secondly, thats 38 million Americans.
0370	KASICH	Now we need to have open and free trade.
0371	KASICH	You know, I was saying  I do these townhalls all the time.
0372	KASICH	I love them, by the way.
0373	KASICH	Look, remember when we got all of those Japanese cars coming into our country?
0374	KASICH	You know what happened to U.S. cars?
0375	KASICH	They got better.
0376	KASICH	Innovation and competition really works, okay.
0377	KASICH	But at the same time when we do trade agreements and other countries cheat, and they do cheat  some of them manipulate their currency, and we need to call them on it when they do it.
0378	KASICH	When we find it, we need to call them on it.
0379	KASICH	But let me tell you another issue for you.
0380	KASICH	So we had U.S. steel invest a lot of money in state.
0381	KASICH	They invest money all over the country.
0382	KASICH	The Koreans were dumping tubes inside the U.S. That means selling product below the cost of what it took them to make them.
0383	KASICH	By the time you research them and prove your case, which you would have to do, it could be a year or two and all your people are out of work.
0384	KASICH	We need an earlywarning system.
0385	KASICH	And let me tell you, when they cheat, I will act as the president of the United States.
0386	KASICH	Think of it this way.
0387	KASICH	If Ohio State came up to play your beloved Badgers and I asked for five downs to get a first down and you only got four, how would you feel?
0388	KASICH	You wouldnt put up with it, okay?
0389	KASICH	We should not put up with countries when they cheat.
0390	KASICH	But that does not keep us from embracing the notion of open and free trade.
0391	KASICH	One other thing, we now have this trade agreement on the table, you the TPP agreement.
0392	KASICH	You know, what we basically do when we trade is were the most open country, and everybody else has barriers.
0393	KASICH	So what we try to do is to get their barriers down so we get our products into their country.
0394	KASICH	But theres another element of this.
0395	KASICH	You worry about the Chinese and their growing strength, particularly in Asia?
0396	KASICH	Make a trade agreement, integrate ourselves with our friends in Asia who can become a bulwark against the strength of the Chinese.
0397	COOPER	But governor
0398	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)
0399	KASICH	(inaudible) open trade good when they cheat.
0400	KASICH	Youve got to have an earlywarning system.
0401	KASICH	Youve got to shut it off.
0402	KASICH	And by the way, agriculture depends on exports more than about any other industry in this country.
0403	COOPER	But, governor, that message isnt resonate  I mean, Donald Trump is saying trade deals are essentially bad.
0404	COOPER	Theyre exporting jobs overseas.
0405	COOPER	Thats the message which seems to be resonating with voters.
0406	KASICH	Anderson, I can say all kinds of things to get people stirred up, but leaders dont do that.
0407	KASICH	Leaders tell people the way that they see it, even if it means for a while youre unpopular.
0408	KASICH	Look, when I  after my first  you cant believe how many people I made angry in Washington by fighting to balance the budget.
0409	KASICH	Now in Ohio, in my first year in office, I was one of the most unpopular governors, but I knew what the formula was, and now Im one of the most popular governors.
0410	KASICH	You cannot make decisions as a leader by putting your finger in the air and  or doing focus groups or telling people what they want to hear so you get them involved, but you know what theyre saying  what youre saying is not true.
0411	KASICH	I will not do that.
0412	KASICH	I have never done it in my lifetime, and Im not about to start.
0413	KASICH	Period and end of story.
0414	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0415	COOPER	This is William Dunford.
0416	COOPER	Hes a student at Marquette University.
0417	COOPER	He says he supports Ted Cruz  William.
0418	QUESTION	Thank you, governor.
0419	QUESTION	My question is, 70 years after World War II and a quarter century after the Cold War ended, a lot of European security remained a responsibility for Americans?
0420	QUESTION	And given that Europeans are wealthy enough to defend themselves, why shouldnt they?
0421	KASICH	Well, young man, look, I dont know if youre a leader in your family or not.
0422	KASICH	But leaders, you know, there are people in here who do more for their family than their brothers and sisters, their siblings.
0423	KASICH	OK?
0424	KASICH	And sometime, your spouse says why do we have do this all the time?
0425	KASICH	Because thats what leaders do.
0426	KASICH	I mean, frankly, of course, the Europeans can do more to support themselves.
0427	KASICH	Their economies, by and large, have been a shambles.
0428	KASICH	So, they need to straighten out their economies.
0429	KASICH	And its a really tough struggle.
0430	KASICH	I mean, I can tell you that its hard for them to get right with things.
0431	KASICH	So, they are weak economically.
0432	KASICH	That doesnt excuse them from not carrying their share of the load.
0433	KASICH	But at the same time, we dont want to have those relationships deteriorate or be eliminated.
0434	KASICH	You know why?
0435	KASICH	Because it hurts us, too.
0436	KASICH	We need to have a strong Western Europe.
0437	KASICH	And by the way, I heard  I just heard briefly somebody was saying that we should just ignore Ukraine.
0438	KASICH	Are you kidding me?
0439	KASICH	The United States of America should be arming the Ukrainians who want to fight for freedom against Putin.
0440	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0441	KASICH	We should be arming them with nonlethal  with lethal defensive aid.
0442	KASICH	Now, young man, we should always tell them youve got to do more.
0443	KASICH	And we should use whatever leverage we have to get them to do more.
0444	KASICH	But Im going to tell you as Americans, as long as Ive been alive, we always carry more of the share of the burden than we would like.
0445	KASICH	We always do.
0446	KASICH	And you know theres an old Scripture that says To whom much is given, much is expected. And as president, I would fight to get them to give us more, and I would use whatever leverage I could to get them to give us more.
0447	KASICH	But to be honest with you, were always going to complain about this.
0448	KASICH	But to walk away from that alliance, are you kidding me?
0449	KASICH	If we walk away and it gets weaker, how long do you think it will take the Islamists to come over here?
0450	KASICH	We need to work with them to destroy ISIS in the Middle East, and then weve got to work together as a society.
0451	KASICH	Thats the way it works.
0452	KASICH	So, theres no easy way out of this.
0453	KASICH	And you know, when you are a leader who has seen these things, then you get a sobering approach.
0454	KASICH	Thats why the Journal Centennial here in Milwaukee said Kasich is a pragmatic conservative.
0455	KASICH	Because you just cant knock all the pieces off the chess board when you get frustrated.
0456	KASICH	Its a good question, there.
0457	COOPER	Governor, thank you.
0458	COOPER	Were going to take a quick break.
0459	COOPER	Were going to have more questions for Governor Kasich as this 360 CNN town hall continues.

0462	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0463	COOPER	Welcome back.
0464	COOPER	We continue the conversation, taking more voter questions for Ohio governor John Kasich.
0465	COOPER	Thanks very much for joining us again.
0466	COOPER	I want to ask you a question which I asked to each of the other candidates as well, and had some surprising answers.
0467	COOPER	A pledge was made early on in this race by all the GOP candidates, saying that they would pledge to support whoever the nominee was.
0468	COOPER	Tonight Donald Trump said that pledge, essentially, was null and void.
0469	COOPER	He would not pledge to continue to support whoever the nominee is, he would have to wait and see.
0470	COOPER	And, Ted Cruz wouldnt really answer it, but implied that a lot has changed, and that not that Donald Trump has
0471	KASICH	 Maybe I wont answer it either.
0472	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0473	KASICH	Anderson, heres the thing, this is what you have to weigh, and I wish everybody could get out and experience this.
0474	KASICH	When youre in the arena, OK?
0475	KASICH	You develop respect for people that are in the arena, but you know?
0476	KASICH	Ive been disturbed by some of the things that Ive seen, and I have to think about what my word and endorsement would mean in a presidential campaign.
0477	KASICH	So, I want to see how this thing finishes out, and you know what?
0478	KASICH	I want to tell you, I think the little engine that can keeps going.
0479	KASICH	I sure hope theyll endorse me for president when Im the nominee coming out of the convention in Cleveland, hows that?
0480	KASICH	Is that a good answer?
0481	KASICH	I dont know.
0482	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0483	SYSTEM	(LAUGHING)
0484	COOPER	I would be remiss not to follow up, essentially youre saying its in the balance.
0485	COOPER	Youre kind of waiting to see?
0486	KASICH	Well, I would say that that would be a good way to describe it.
0487	COOPER	So, youre not ironclad, standing by the initial pledge to support whoever the nominee is?
0488	KASICH	You know, frankly, all of us shouldnt have even answered that question, but it was the first debate, and  you know?
0489	KASICH	What the heck, sometimes you answer questions  you ought to just say Im not answering it.
0490	COOPER	So, now, just to be clear
0491	KASICH	 Im as clear as youre going to get out of me.
0492	COOPER	Youre not standing by that pledge
0493	KASICH	No, I dont want to be political here.
0494	KASICH	I got to see what happens.
0495	KASICH	If the nominee is somebody that I think is really hurting the country, and dividing the country, I cant stand behind them, but we have a ways to go.
0496	KASICH	Lets see how this all folds out, and then Ill let you know
0497	COOPER	 Is it fair to say that you believe Donald Trump looks like he would harm the country if he was the nominee?
0498	KASICH	Thatll be up to the voters here.
0499	KASICH	Im not going to get into that.
0500	KASICH	Thats too much below the belt.
0501	COOPER	I want to introduce you to Time Carey, hes a small business owner.
0502	COOPER	He says shes still undecided.
0503	COOPER	Tim, welcome.
0504	QUESTION	Hello, Governor, welcome to Wisconsin.
0505	QUESTION	My family and I raced sled dogs in Northern Wisconsin, and this last year we started a business manufacturing sled dog equipment, a partner of mine and myself.
0506	QUESTION	I funded the whole thing myself so far up to this point, and I just  I was wondering what your policies on small business to help people get small businesses going, or tax incentives, or what your thoughts were on that.
0507	KASICH	I hate to keep talking about my state, but its a good illustration of my philosophy if I become president.
0508	KASICH	Our small businesses pay virtually no income tax in Ohio because we want small businesses to grow, and for the young people that are here, the best chance you have of getting a job once you graduate from college is with a small business.
0509	KASICH	So, Im for lowering the income taxes nationally.
0510	KASICH	Id like to have a 28, a 25 and a 10 percent rate because you probably pay through on your personal taxes, you have a passthrough corporation.
0511	KASICH	So, we need to bring the taxes down and help small businesses.
0512	KASICH	The other thing we have to be careful of is were not snuffing out the small lending institutions, the community banks.
0513	KASICH	I was  where was I?
0514	KASICH	I was in La Crosse, and I went to this little bakery.
0515	KASICH	And this woman proudly was talking about how she built this bakery business.
0516	KASICH	It was a fantastic place.
0517	KASICH	And she said a got a $9,000 loan.
0518	KASICH	I said, how did you get it?
0519	KASICH	She said, well, I went to one local community bank and said if you have wont loan me the money, Im going to go to the one down the street.
0520	KASICH	What were facing now in America because of the overregulation on some of the big banks thats trickled down to the smaller banks is were beginning to see the smaller banks go out of business.
0521	KASICH	Those are the ones you depend upon to get the loan you need because they know you, right?
0522	KASICH	So I think first of all, lower taxes  of course, for you.
0523	KASICH	Commonsense regulation so were not crushing you with another stupid for that somebody in the government decides you have to abide by.
0524	KASICH	And a path to fiscal stability, a balanced budget.
0525	KASICH	Those are the things that will help you more than anything else.
0526	KASICH	And one final thing workforce development.
0527	KASICH	We have got to begin to teach our kids in K through 12 and also in the community college and the fouryear schools to be getting an education for a job that exists.
0528	KASICH	Dont get educated in a vacuum.
0529	KASICH	Make sure you know what you want to do, and look for an education that can lead you to a real job.
0530	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0531	KASICH	Good luck.
0532	KASICH	Good luck.
0533	COOPER	Let me follow up on that.
0534	COOPER	Sorry 
0535	KASICH	I did a sled dog trip one time in New Hampshire many years ago, and I thought I was going to drown in the water.
0536	KASICH	When I come up, you can give me a safe ride.
0537	KASICH	Hows that?
0538	UNIDENTIFIED MALE	All right.
0539	UNIDENTIFIED MALE	Yeah, any time.
0540	UNIDENTIFIED MALE	Thank you.
0541	COOPER	I want to follow up on that, because you often  and youve done it tonight  touting Ohios economic record.
0542	COOPER	According to FactCheck.org, Ohio has actually lagged behind the nation in job growth during your tenure as governor.
0543	COOPER	So why  if thats true, because they say 
0544	KASICH	Well, thats not true.
0545	COOPER	Well, they say private sector job in Ohio was 9.3 percent during your tenure.
0546	COOPER	The national private sector job growth rate was 11.7 percent 
0547	KASICH	Anderson, we were 48th when I became governor, now were in the top 10.
0548	KASICH	We went from at 350,000 job loss to a 417,000 job gain.
0549	KASICH	Were doing very, very well.
0550	KASICH	But were not out of the woods yet.
0551	KASICH	But  lets go back to Washington.
0552	KASICH	When I fought for all those years to balance the budget, cut the capital gains tax  thats the tax that gentleman uses when is he takes a risk  jobs were flying out like you couldnt believe.
0553	KASICH	And there was no discussion of income inequality.
0554	KASICH	There are three things needed to grow an economy common sense regulations we dont have them now.
0555	KASICH	Lower taxes all the taxes are going up.
0556	KASICH	And a balanced  and a movement toward a balanced budget.
0557	KASICH	And were blowing all the budget up.
0558	KASICH	So you go to the doctor, say, how do I get healthy?
0559	KASICH	They say, well, you do these three things.
0560	KASICH	You go back, say, Im not feeling well.
0561	KASICH	And he or she says, well, what did you do?
0562	KASICH	Well, I didnt listen to anything you said.
0563	KASICH	nan
0564	KASICH	So, this is a formula that will work to bring our country back.
0565	KASICH	Folks, I only say it because Im only doing this because I want to you have job security.
0566	KASICH	And I want to you believe that your kids are going to have a better life than you got from your parents.
0567	KASICH	Thats the great American legacy and thats when Im committed to, folks.
0568	KASICH	No matter who I tick off in the process.
0569	KASICH	Thats what we got to do, okay?

0576	MARY BETH GAHN, SALES REPRESENTATIVE	Good evening, Governor.
0577	KASICH	Yes.
0578	GAHN	As a practices Roman Catholic, I believe life begins at conception and ends at natural death.
0579	GAHN	If you were our president, would you support legislation or a nominee to the Supreme Court which would would create a protected class for unborn persons the same way we have protected classes for minority races and sexual orientations?
0580	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0581	KASICH	Ive been prolife all of my career.
0582	KASICH	The only exceptions are rape, incest and life of the mother.
0583	KASICH	Now, when it comes to a Supreme Court justice, weve got to be careful about litmus tests because we dont know where they begin and where they end.
0584	KASICH	But I want to appoint judges who are conservative, who dont make law but interpret the law.
0585	KASICH	And when it comes to my prolife record, I mean, it speaks for itself.
0586	KASICH	The other thing I would tell you, though, you said life begins and then it ends at death.
0587	KASICH	Im going to give you another thought.
0588	KASICH	Life begins, then it ends at death and then we have another life yet to come.
0589	KASICH	Dont lose sight of that.
0590	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0591	GAHN	Thank you, Governor.

0595	KASICH	Okay.
0596	COOPER	Our next guest is Joseph Rice.
0597	COOPER	He is a small business  or he is a business owner from White Fish Bay.
0598	COOPER	He says he is slightly leaning towards Ted Cruz but that his heart is with you, governor.
0599	COOPER	Joseph?
0600	KASICH	Well, then go with the heart, man!
0601	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0602	JOSEPH RICE, BUSINESS OWNER	Well, Ill try to ask a heartfelt question here, Governor.
0603	JOSEPH RICE, BUSINESS OWNER	Im curious to know how you may have shown moral courage in the face of public opposition.
0604	JOSEPH RICE, BUSINESS OWNER	So can you cite an action that you took or decision that you made knowing it was the right thing to do, despite it being politically unpopular?
0605	KASICH	Well, I  look, I dont want to get into how courageous I am or anything, but look, we  the gentleman stood up, first question out of here was Medicaid expansion.
0606	KASICH	I knew it wasnt going to be all that popular.
0607	KASICH	Of course I wasnt thinking about running for president.
0608	KASICH	Ill tell you the story.
0609	KASICH	I had this woman, shes terrific.
0610	KASICH	She runs our mental health, drug addiction services.
0611	KASICH	She comes into my office and says  I said to her, do you think Im going to expand Medicaid?
0612	KASICH	And she says, well, I pray every night you will.
0613	KASICH	And I said, well, okay, your prayers are answered Im going do it.
0614	KASICH	She walked out of my office into the ante (ph) room and broke down and cried of joy for the fact that she can now help more people.
0615	KASICH	You know, the fact is, is that you cant sit around worrying about who is really going to like you.
0616	KASICH	Ill give you another one.
0617	KASICH	When I was in Washington, I said if were going to reform welfare for the poor people, we ought to reform it for the rich people.
0618	KASICH	So I fought for corporate welfare reform.
0619	KASICH	And we closed some of the loopholes that these big companies got when they moved  you know, when they moved out of the country to get  or moved to Puerto Rico, for example, to get tax advantages.
0620	KASICH	I thought it was the right thing to do.
0621	KASICH	You wouldnt believe how hard it was to get the federal budget balanced.
0622	KASICH	One time we had a conference, I wanted to present the opposition to the Clinton tax increase, and I had a specific program to fight that, and we had a Republican conference, and Newt was sitting in the back of the room, and we had 36 speakers, and 34 said, Kasich shouldnt unveil this plan.
0623	KASICH	I walked to the back of the room.
0624	KASICH	I said, Newt, how are we doing?
0625	KASICH	He said, better than I thought wed be.
0626	KASICH	The plan got out.
0627	KASICH	And if you ever heard Joe Scarborough talk, the battle that we engaged in, in 93 and 94 against the Clinton tax increases inspired him to run for Congress, and brought a whole new wave of people into the Congress.
0628	KASICH	Sir, what you have to realize in this business is youre there for a short period of time.
0629	KASICH	You have to drive the car when you get your hands on the wheel, and you got to have people around that will tell you when youre on the wrong path, because sometimes you get on the wrong path.
0630	KASICH	But I have to also tell you, you dont ever want to look back and say, I played politics, I took care of my party and I didnt serve the people.
0631	KASICH	So Ive been in politics a long time.
0632	KASICH	Im as a big of a reformer and an idealist as I was the day I got elected, because I believe we can change the world and make the world better for everyone.
0633	KASICH	And sometimes you get people upset.
0634	KASICH	Thats kind of goes with the territory.
0635	KASICH	You know what Harry Truman said, if you want a friend and youre in Washington, you better go get a dog.
0636	KASICH	Okay?
0637	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0638	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)

0643	COOPER	She says shes undecided.
0644	COOPER	Welcome, Charlotte.
0645	QUESTION	Hello.
0646	QUESTION	Governor Kasich, if you become the nominee of the party, who are you going to pick for your vice president?
0647	KASICH	Are you available?
0648	KASICH	You look great tonight.
0649	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0650	KASICH	No, you know what, thats so far ahead.
0651	KASICH	Thats like measuring the drapes.
0652	KASICH	But I picked a lieutenant governor, somebody to run with me, a great woman, she was our auditor, and I picked her to run with me because she understood what I wanted to accomplish, and she was willing to be a really great teammate.
0653	KASICH	Shes done great job.
0654	KASICH	So you want to pick somebody who youre comfortable with and somebody who understands what youre all about, and somebody whos not afraid to speak up to you.
0655	KASICH	You see, you cant just surround yourself with sycophants.
0656	KASICH	Youve got to have people there that can tell you, no, I dont think thats right, and then you argue it out.
0657	KASICH	And at the end, though, at the end, once you decide, the whole team moves in the same direction.
0658	KASICH	I have been able to be able to accomplish things in politics, Im going to tell you, not because Im so great, but Ive been able to attract people throughout the years  I have some people that have been around me for 30 years.
0659	KASICH	And we form a great team, and we keep our eyes on the horizon.
0660	KASICH	And you know what I believe, I think everybody wants to be involved with something thats bigger than themselves.
0661	KASICH	And thats what I always try to represent and present in public life.
0662	KASICH	So itd be somebody along those lines.
0663	KASICH	Okay?
0664	KASICH	Aaron Rodgers maybe if he had a better year next year.
0665	KASICH	Well see.
0666	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)
0667	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0668	COOPER	Were going take a quick break.
0669	COOPER	Were going to have more with Governor Kasich as our CNN Republican townhall continues from Milwaukee.
0670	COOPER	Well be right back.
0671	SYSTEM	(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
0672	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0673	COOPER	Welcome back.
0674	COOPER	Were here with Governor John Kasich of Ohio.
0675	COOPER	Were here in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
0676	COOPER	Yesterday CNN reported that your campaign is looking to work or coordinate behind the scenes with the Cruz campaign in an effort to try to deny Donald Trump delegates to get to the nomination.
0677	COOPER	Is that something  I mean, have approached Ted Cruz directly about that yourself?
0678	KASICH	No, no, Im not involved in the process stuff.
0679	KASICH	I mean, campaigns always talk.
0680	KASICH	I mean, there is always ways they do it.
0681	KASICH	But Im not in the middle of that.
0682	KASICH	And I havent seen Ted since the last debate.
0683	KASICH	So Im not involved in that.
0684	COOPER	We were talking during the break about how many townhalls.
0685	COOPER	You said youve probably done over 200 or so.
0686	KASICH	Yes.
0687	KASICH	Just like this.
0688	COOPER	And I remember, I spoke with you at a townhall that we did in South Carolina.
0689	COOPER	And one of the things you said to that has always stuck in my mind, I kind of wanted to follow up with you about.
0690	COOPER	You said that this campaign has caused you to slow down.
0691	COOPER	And I wondered  it was in reference to an incident you had with a young man at a town hall.
0692	KASICH	Ive had many incidents.
0693	COOPER	In what way has it caused you to slow down?
0694	KASICH	Well, because theres a lot of lonely people out there.
0695	KASICH	They come to my meetings and they say things  I havent seen it in Wisconsin, but I have seen it all over the country.
0696	KASICH	And the young man that gave me a hug was just emblematic of what Ive seen all over.
0697	KASICH	I think when people want to feel safe and for some reason they come to the townhalls I have, which are basically townhalls about how we can fix things and how we can be hopeful, and for some reason people feel safe.
0698	KASICH	And I  thats the grace of the lord as far as Im concerned, to let people feel that way.
0699	KASICH	And, I would also say  and this is important.
0700	KASICH	I want to ship a lot of programs back to the states, but heres what I really want everybody to know I believe.
0701	KASICH	The spirit of our country, Anderson, doesnt rest in the president.
0702	KASICH	I mean, the presidents important, but the spirit of our country rests in the neighborhoods, it rests in the people who are here tonight.
0703	KASICH	Were the ones that need to change the world, were the ones that need to fix education, deal with the problems of the poor.
0704	KASICH	You know, one of the things Ive said, you take a lady who was married 50 years, her husband died, nobody calls her anymore.
0705	KASICH	Call her on a Monday, what does she do on a Thursday?
0706	KASICH	Shes gets her hair done, then when Saturday comes, when youre going to take her to dinner somehow not one hair is out of place.
0707	KASICH	When you pick her up she wears a dress she hadnt worn in six months.
0708	KASICH	Are you changing the world?
0709	KASICH	I think you are.
0710	KASICH	When a nurse spends an extra 15 minutes with a family thats in trouble and says things are going to be OK, Anderson, I just happen to believe  I dont want to get too carried away here.
0711	KASICH	But, you know?
0712	KASICH	The Lords given us all a certain purpose in life, and we need to carry it out.
0713	KASICH	We need to live a life bigger than ourselves.
0714	KASICH	Now, Im not applying for sainthood, and neither is anybody else, but we can get up every day and try to live a life to help heal this world.
0715	KASICH	We need the solutions in Washington to create the jobs.
0716	KASICH	That is an absolute  without jobs we dont have anything.
0717	KASICH	But, when we shift welfare, education, infrastructure, job training, Medicaid programs back to the states then weve got to run them, and we have to run them where we live.
0718	KASICH	And, frankly, state government ought to be shifting more power to the neighborhoods.
0719	KASICH	Thats the spirit of our country.
0720	KASICH	The spirit of our country  dont you think where we live?
0721	KASICH	Its in you.
0722	KASICH	Its in you.
0723	KASICH	Its in me, and him.
0724	KASICH	Its not in somebody, you know, down in Washington D.C.
0725	KASICH	You think?
0726	KASICH	I mean, I hope so.
0727	KASICH	I believe that.
0728	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)
0729	COOPER	I want to thank you for taking part.
0730	KASICH	Thats it?
0731	COOPER	Yeah.
0732	COOPER	I want to thank you for this town hall, wed love to do another one.
0733	COOPER	That is all the time we have.
0734	COOPER	I want to thank all the candidates, thank the voters who had such good questions.
0735	COOPER	Everyone in this room who made tonight possible, including the Riverside Theater and Turner Hall here in Milwaukee.
0736	COOPER	Thank You.
