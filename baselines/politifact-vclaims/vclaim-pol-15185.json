Thirteen attorneys general have signed on. They are:\n\nMcCollum, Florida\nHenry McMaster, South Carolina (R)\nJon Bruning, Nebraska (R)\nGregg Abbott, Texas (R) \nMark Shurtleff, Utah (R)\nJames D. \"Buddy\" Caldwell, Louisiana (D)\nTroy King, Alabama (R)\nMichael A. Cox, Michigan (R)\nJohn W. Suthers, Colorado (R)\nThomas W. Corbett Jr., Pennsylvania (R)\nRobert M. McKenna, Washington (R)\nLawrence G. Wasden, Idaho (R)\nMarty J. Jackley, South Dakota (R)\n\nOf that list, Caldwell of Louisiana is the lone Democrat. The rest are Republicans. There is no hard and fast definition of bipartisan, but it's quite a stretch to say one out of 13 is bipartisan. As a point of reference, consider two Congressional actions that are almost universally described as bipartisan -- the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 and the 1996 welfare overhaul.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNinety-eight Democrats and 230 Republicans voted for the welfare reform package in the U.S. House. Another 25 Democrats joined 53 Republicans voting for the bill in the U.S. Senate. No Child Left Behind passed 381-41 in the House with 183 Republicans and 198 Democrats voting for it. It passed 87-10 in the Senate with the support of 44 Republicans and 43 Democrats.\nMcCollum, who is running for governor, claims that his constitutional challenge of the landmark health care bill passed by Congress is a \"bipartisan effort.\" That's pretty misleading when only one out of 13 attorneys general supporting the lawsuit is something other than a Republican. As such, we rate his claim Barely True.\nEditor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-15185"}
