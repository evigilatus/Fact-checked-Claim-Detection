As of Nov. 11, the Associated Press reported that Biden had 290 electoral votes to Trump\u2019s 214 with the election outcome in three states still outstanding.\u00a0\nThe media \"calls\" races for candidates, but it\u2019s a projection based on available information about the ballots cast for each candidate.\u00a0We wrote about what happens next, and you can read about it here.\nNow for some history.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.

The headline read: \"Dewey defeats Truman,\" and there\u2019s a photo of former President Harry Truman holding up the paper and laughing.\u00a0\nRecalling the error in a 2007 story, the Tribune reported that the paper had been \"lulled into a false sense of security by polls that repeatedly predicted a Dewey victory\" and a printers\u2019 strike forced the Tribune to go to press hours before it normally would.\u00a0\nThe paper changed the headline for the second edition after radio bulletins said that the race was close, according to the Tribune. The headline in the second edition said: \"Democrats make sweep of state offices.\"\u00a0\nIn 2000, some news outlets called Florida for then-Vice President Al Gore. They withdrew it later that night and by early morning the state was still too close to call. On Nov. 8, the Florida secretary of state announced that George W. Bush had won Florida by a narrow margin, which meant he also won the presidency. The Democrats sued to force a recount in several counties and lost at the Supreme Court.\u00a0\nIn 2016, leading up to Election Day, national and state polls consistently showed Clinton beating Trump and forecasters guessed her chance of winning ranged from 70% to 99%. But media organizations didn\u2019t call the election for Clinton, who lost. The Associated Press called the race for Trump at 2:29 a.m. Eastern Time on Nov. 9, and a few minutes later, TV networks started to report that Clinton had called Trump to concede.\nWe rate claims that the media called the election for Clinton False.\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click here, for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18509"}
