Kamala Harris sounds in her 2020 presidential campaign is that \"justice is on the ballot.\" The California Democrat did so repeatedly in a Facebook video ad, which leads off with this claim:\n\"In America, there is a father who is holding down two jobs and paying more taxes than the richest 400 families in America.\"\nHer statement is based on a study that produced startling headlines, such as one in the Washington Post: \"For the first time in history, U.S. billionaires paid a lower tax rate than the working class last year.\"\nBut Harris misfired by making her claim about taxes paid instead of tax rates. Also, the study, while produced by two prominent economists, makes estimates based on assumptions that are not universally accepted among economists.\nThe study\nThe study, published as a book about a month before Harris\u2019 claim, was done by leading economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman of the University of California, Berkeley, whose work PolitiFact has relied on for previous fact-checks.\u00a0\nHarris\u2019 campaign told us Harris was referring to rates, even though that isn\u2019t what Harris said.\nThe study said that in 2018, the average effective tax rate paid by the bottom half of American households was 24.2% \u2014 a full percentage point higher than the 23% rate paid by the 400 richest families.\u00a0\nAs the book puts it, \"the Trumps, the Zuckerbergs and the Buffetts of this world pay lower tax rates than teachers and secretaries.\"\nSo, to use Harris\u2019 example, a typical father with two jobs pays a higher tax rate than the richest 400 American families \u2014 according to one study by prominent economists.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s not the same as paying more taxes.\nIndeed, an individual with $1 million in taxable income would pay roughly $230,000 in all federal and state taxes, Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, told us. Someone with $50,000 in taxable income would pay about $12,000.\nCriticism of the study\nMoreover, the study Harris relied on makes estimates for 2018, and its methodology has come in for criticism from some economists.\nThat isn\u2019t to say that the study is wrong or that the critics are right. But the picture isn\u2019t as clear as Harris\u2019 statement suggests.\nFederal tax data for 2018 were not available, so the Saez-Zucman study had to do extrapolations, Gleckman wrote in a critique of the study. That is \"no easy feat,\" because of fundamental changes made by the 2017 Republican tax cuts; plus, the study excluded certain federal tax credits received by lower- and middle-income people.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe upshot, according to Gleckman:\u00a0\nIncomes of the very rich are rising faster than for all other income groups, and Trump\u2019s tax law cut the taxes of high earners by more on average than for low- and moderate-income households; \"but that doesn\u2019t mean that billionaires paid a lower tax rate than the working class.\"\nA similar criticism was made by economists Aparna Mathur of the American Enterprise Institute and Kyle Pomerleau of the Tax Foundation.\u00a0\nThe Saez-Zucman study, they wrote, \"rests on several unconventional methodological assumptions which, in our opinion, biases the outcome towards finding relatively lower tax rates on the wealthy compared to the poor and overstates the decline in top earners\u2019 tax burdens.\"\nDavid Splinter, an economist at Congress\u2019 Joint Committee on Taxation, also found fault with the Saez-Zucman study\u2019s methodology and conclusion that tax rates are nearly equal for people at opposite ends of the income scale. The joint committee, the Tax Policy Center, the U.S. Treasury, the Congressional Budget Office and economists all have found that federal taxes are progressive, he wrote in a critique of the study.\nThe study\u2019s assumptions, Tax Foundation economist Erica York told us, \"go against the widely-accepted methods that exist for determining tax burdens, without providing a convincing reason for doing so.\"\nSaez referred us to a frequently asked questions web page that explains the study\u2019s rationale and addresses some of the criticism.\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison economist Andrew Reschovsky praised the study, but called Harris\u2019 claim misleading.\n\"In dollar terms, the father holding down two jobs is certainly paying less in taxes than the taxes paid by the richest families,\" Reschovsky told us. \"What Harris should have said, is that the father holding down two jobs is paying a larger share of his income in taxes than the average richest families are paying in taxes relative to their incomes.\"\nBut, again, that scenario comes from a study that is in some dispute.\nOur ruling\nHarris said, \"In America, there is a father who is holding down two jobs and paying more taxes than the richest 400 families in America.\"\nThe study Harris relies on estimates that a typical taxpayer pays a higher tax rate on federal, state and local taxes \u2014 not that he pays more in actual taxes \u2014 than do the richest families. And even on rates, the difference is not especially large: 24.2% vs. 23%.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s important because, while the study was done by leading economists, it relies on estimates and a methodology that some economists say makes the tax system look less progressive than it actually is.\nMost critically, there is nothing in Harris\u2019 ad that suggested she was talking about tax rates rather than taxes paid.\u00a0\nFor a statement that contains only an element of truth, we give Harris a Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16815"}
