Vote \"no\" and driver fingerprints would be gathered and run through the FBI.\nRejecting the proposal, the mailer suggests, gives \"the City a blank check to fund a takeover\" of background checks \"and sends taxpayers the bill.\"\nSo, hide your pocketbook?\nNot so fast, we found.\nCouncil member: Taxpayers not on barrel\nBefore we saw the mailer, an Austin City Council member disputed the notion that taxpayers will be charged for fingerprinting drivers. An April 19, 2016, Austin American-Statesman news story quoted Ann Kitchen, sponsor of the ordinance the proposition would repeal, saying the council agreed to levy a 1 percent fee on the ride-hailing companies\u2019 gross local revenue to go to a city fund to \"assist and incent drivers to become compliant\" with the new rules. Then again, according to an April 22, 2016, commentary by Ben Wear, the American-Statesman\u2019s transportation writer, that\u2019s to be charged only if companies fail to take certain steps to get drivers fingerprinted as quickly as possible.\nThe incentive fee was created to help allay ride-hailing drivers\u2019 concerns about the costs of the fingerprint check \u2014 expected to be nearly $40 per driver, city spokeswoman Alicia Dean told us by email. Dean added: \"This is what it costs for checks we do for other driver background checks for other vehicles for hire.\"\nWe asked if the city or council had decided to cover the costs. Dean replied: \"No.\"\nThere\u2019s also a separate 1 percent fee, to be in place if the proposition passes or not, \"to cover the city\u2019s administrative costs and infrastructure needs,\" the Statesman reported.\nUpshot: Ride-hail companies could be paying up to 2 percent of gross local revenue to the city though another April 2016 American-Statesman news story says ride-hail companies aren\u2019t expected to owe any general fees until at least the end of 2016. The same story quoted a former council member, Chris Riley, saying that when the council approved its first ride-hail regulations in August 2014, the intent was that any such fees cover city administrative costs.\nOf course, all this not-so declamation comes from city-connected officials.\nWe were curious how Ridesharing Works for Austin arrived at its millions-of-dollars\u2019 conclusion.\nTo our query, spokesman Travis Considine pointed out by email that prospective-driver fingerprints are to be run through the FBI, according to the ordinance adopted by the council in December 2015. Specifically, the ordinance authorizes the city or an approved \"third party\" to submit each driver-applicant\u2019s fingerprints to the Texas Department of Public Safety for a search of state criminal records and to forward the fingerprints to the FBI for the national check.\n\"The results of the FBI check will be returned to the DPS,\" the ordinance says, \"which will disseminate the results of state and national criminal history checks to the City.\" Next, the ordinance says, the department shall use each result to determine if the applicant is prohibited from driving for a Transportation Network Company, as in ride-hail service.\nNot that the city expects all of this in a hurry. \u00a0During a phase-in, the ordinance says, the city\u2019s Transportation Department is to implement procedures to help drivers obtain fingerprints and background checks with each company expected to have 99 percent of its drivers checked by February 2017 or be subject to financial penalties.\nConsidine suggested city reviews of each completed check will entail massive upticks in staff and spending to process thousands of reports coming back from the DPS. The services currently conduct name-based checks on their own.\nUber lobbyist: 50,000 background checks will burden city\nConsidine also put us in touch with Adam Goldman, an Austin lobbyist for Uber, who said by phone the few city workers who currently review applications for chauffeur licenses can\u2019t possibly be expected to handle the surge in applications likely to come from ride-hail drivers seeking to fulfill the city\u2019s requirements.\nIf voters say \"no\" to the proposition, Goldman said, city staff stand to see fingerprint-fueled checks submitted for 50,000 drivers -- a figure he said reflects the number of Austin-area residents who have driven at least once for Uber.\nHold that count. An Uber spokeswoman, Jaime Moore, previously told us it has 15,000 Austin-area drivers though that total fluctuates. Moore, informed of Goldman\u2019s 50,000 figure, replied by email that nearly 50,000 Austin-area people went through the Uber screening process in the last year -- though many of them didn\u2019t make it through.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, Moore suggested we put stock in the \"50,000\" because Goldman didn\u2019t consider Austin-area Lyft drivers. So, Moore said, \"we would expect the number\" of individuals whose background checks would require the city\u2019s final review \"to be much higher than 50,000.\"\nGoldman didn\u2019t offer a calculation to back up the predicted \"millions\" in city costs. But Considine, asked for an equation behind the group\u2019s claim, suggested multiplying 50,000 times the possible $40 charge per background check, which plays out to $2 million.\nAlternatively, we noted, if you go with the low-end count of 10,000 drivers, you get $400,000 in possible costs.\nWe asked Considine if it\u2019s fair to consider either total a city cost in that the city, far as we can tell, hasn\u2019t said it\u2019s funding the checks. He didn\u2019t reply.\nIt also occurred to us there might be fewer ride-hail drivers if the proposition fails; some might resist fingerprinting. Considine agreed, saying by phone: \"That is what happened in Houston. Uber in Houston is different than Austin; the wait times are longer, the surge pricing,\" pricing at peak travel times, \"is higher.\"\nHouston official: No spike in taxpayer-funded costs\nIt made sense to us to consider Houston\u2019s experience. The Bayou City has required fingerprint-driven background checks of ride-hail drivers since November 2014, also demanding drug tests, physicals and vehicle inspections.\nSo we reached out to the city\u2019s Administration and Regulatory Affairs Department to ask if administrative costs spiked. By phone, spokeswoman Lara Cottingham said the city experienced an \"enormous spike\" in applicants after Uber agreed to comply with the city\u2019s security requirements. However, she said, the department didn\u2019t add staff for its final reviews; as before Uber arrived in Houston, a single employee looks over 200 to 300 driver background checks a day. If a background check shows any offense disqualifying a person for a license, the application is denied, Cottingham said, but the city also sets up a hearing for the driver to seek reconsideration, in accord with state law, she said. \"There\u2019s been no real change other than she\u2019s a lot busier than before,\" Cottingham said.\nCottingham said driver-applicants are allowed to get fingerprinted by a designated private vendor or may visit the DPS in Austin to be fingerprinted. Generally, Cottingham said, fees paid by Uber, the amount of which she said the company doesn\u2019t consider public information, more than cover city costs.\nAustin official: Staff can 'flex'\nNext, we asked Austin\u2019s Transportation Department if the pro-proposition group\u2019s cost claim comports with its expectations.\nWe sought elaboration about flexing up; Dean replied that the department has 12 employees including about eight \"administrative personnel\" who could process such applications plus at least five professional staff who \"could be flexed to review reports.\"\nGordon Derr, an assistant director in the department, earlier said by email: \"Possibly, the number of staff may need to increase to handle large numbers of applications, but the activities overseeing vehicles-for-hire are funded by the enterprise fund for the city.\"\nThat\u2019s not tax revenue, we recognized. By email, a department spokeswoman, Cheyenne Krause, said the ride-hail fees authorized by the council would go into the department\u2019s enterprise fund which to date brings together parking revenue and fees paid by ground transportation service companies and drivers, funding department staff and administration.\nDerr earlier said: \"Possibly, the number of staff may need to increase to handle large numbers of applications, but the activities overseeing vehicles-for-hire are funded by the enterprise fund for the city,\" which applies to programs generally funded from fees, not taxes. \"Costs would not be paid from the general fund,\" which supports tax-backed activities, \"therefore the costs would not be billed to the taxpayers,\" Derr said, adding: \"It has yet to be determined who would be responsible for paying for background checks.\"\nDerr said the city has \"engaged\" a DPS contractor, Morphotrust, to take fingerprints from prospective drivers. Once prints are taken, he wrote, \"Morphotrust works through DPS to process the background checks through DPS for the state background check and the FBI for federal background checks.\" Next, Derr said, the DPS sends results to the city where staff review them.\nGenerally, Krause later told us by email, staff don\u2019t know \"what will be required and cannot speculate as to the number of background checks that the City will review or the resources that will be required to review the checks. Any potential costs to the City are purely speculative.\"\nOur ruling\nThe Ridesharing Works group said that if voters reject Proposition 1, a \"completely new city-run\" criminal background check \"process will cost millions in processing fees, additional staff and bureaucracy\" with taxpayers getting \"the bill.\"\nThis claim isn\u2019t backed up by Houston\u2019s avowed experience or available facts about Austin\u2019s approach.\nWhat happens next does seem a bit unsettled. For instance, it's up in the air who\u2019s going to pay for each background check reviewed by the city. We also found no authoritative cost estimate for the city\u2019s oversight. Additional staff might be needed, we learned, yet the relevant department also advises it can lean on existing staff.\nHowever, we neither fielded nor found evidence the city\u2019s contemplated reviews of background checks will cost millions. Significantly too, taxpayers aren't poised to get the bill; city costs are to be covered from a fee-backed fund, not tax revenue.\nWe rate this statement False.\n\nFALSE \u2013 The statement is not accurate.\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/25a93054-0729-4f6a-b46d-b20268e6c6ec", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05024"}
