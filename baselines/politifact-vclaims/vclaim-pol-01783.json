They attended the event to denounce a court ruling against Smithfield Foods, the world\u2019s largest pork producer and a partner of many N.C. hog farmers.\nA jury recently\u00a0awarded $25 million\u00a0to an Eastern North Carolina couple after they complained that a Smithfield farm caused swarms of flies, bad smells and other nuisances on their property. Troxler called the ruling \"un-American\" and \"a travesty of justice.\" And he expressed doubt about the extent of damage that hog farms cause.\n\"The Black River starts in Sampson County, runs through Duplin County right through hog country. And the water quality in that river is rated at the very top in North Carolina,\" Troxler said.\n\"Now, how can that be with all of the stories you\u2019ve heard about environmental disasters associated with the hog industry in North Carolina? It\u2019s just not true,\" he continued. \"But I think it goes back to the old adage that if you say it enough times, it must be true. So we have got to disprove that. We\u2019ve got to educate, and we\u2019ve got to talk about it.\"\nDuring hurricanes and other big storms, hog waste sometimes runs into rivers in Eastern North Carolina. Farmers keep the waste in lagoons, or ponds, often to use for fertilizer. The lagoons can overflow during floods.\nThe Black River is a 50-mile-long tributary of the Cape Fear River, which last year was ranked as\u00a0one of America\u2019s \"most endangered\"\u00a0by the American Rivers environmental advocacy group. The group listed the threat of pollution from hog farms as their reason for concern.\nSo PolitiFact wondered about the accuracy of Troxler\u2019s claim about the Black River. Is its water quality \"rated at the very top\" in North Carolina?\nA state classification\nIn an email, a spokeswoman for the state Agriculture Department cited\u00a0Black River\u2019s classification\u00a0with the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality.\nThe river is classified as a swamp that has \"outstanding resource water,\" meaning it has \"excellent water quality\" while \"being of exceptional state or national ecological or recreational significance.\" It\u2019s the highest classification the state offers. And only 900 of the 13,000 water bodies that DEQ examines \u2014 about 7 percent \u2014 have that label, according to Christy Simmons, a spokeswoman for DEQ.\nThe department measures dissolved oxygen, pH, specific conductivity, water temperature, total suspended solids, turbidity and fecal coliform, among other things. Fecal coliform bacteria come from warm-blooded animals. While coliform bacteria won\u2019t necessarily make you sick, their presence can be\u00a0a sign the water is home to harmful pathogens.\nAt two stations in the Black River, fecal coliform is elevated about 10 percent of the time, according to DEQ. The Black River doesn\u2019t violate any of the department\u2019s quality standards. However, DEQ doesn\u2019t collect fecal coliform data frequently enough to assess the extent that fecal coliform growth exists and fluctuates in the river, DEQ spokeswoman Bridget Munger said.\nThe \"true standard\" for measuring fecal coliform levels is to take five samples in a 30-day period, she said, but DEQ collects data only once a month. The lower part of the Black River \"is listed as data inconclusive due to low dissolved oxygen levels in this part of the river system,\" Munger said in an email.\nPolitiFact asked DEQ whether the Black River is, indeed, ranked as one of the state\u2019s cleanest rivers.\n\"I don\u2019t think we have the data to make this specific claim,\" Munger said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It doesn\u2019t violate the water quality standards set for this stream. There are elevated nutrients and fecal coliform bacteria concentrations at times,\" Munger said. \"There is only a single major (wastewater treatment plant) upstream of the Black River but there are many animal feeding operations in the Black River watershed.\"\nLack of testing\nThus, environmental advocates say the Black River\u2019s \"outstanding resource water\" classification isn\u2019t a true reflection of the river\u2019s water quality.\nPart of the reason DEQ hasn\u2019t found more pollution in the Black River is because it\u2019s not properly looking for it and reporting it, said Grady McCallie, policy director at North Carolina Conservation Network.\nNorth Carolina doesn\u2019t have standards for nitrogen and phosphorus in the water \u2014 which\u00a0can cause illness.\n\"If we did, I suspect a lot of the rivers in hog country would show significant burdens of these pollutants. Because we don\u2019t, we rely on chlorophyll-a, a pigment associated with algae, as a marker for too much nutrient pollution,\" McCallie said in an email.\nThe problem with testing for that kind of algae is that it blooms only when the water slows down, he continued.\n\"That\u2019s why you see significant impairment behind (a dam) on the Cape Fear, because the water slows down and the algae blooms. But as long as the Black River keeps flowing, the pollution is just carried down the river to cause problems downstream,\" McCallie said.\nCompounding issues, the state isn\u2019t testing for a wide enough range of nutrients.\n\"Lots of nutrient pollution in the river could be messing up the ecology, but we also don\u2019t have a \u2018periphyton\u2019 standard, which would measure whether we have the right kinds or too much algae on the bank and bottom of the river,\" McCallie said. \"EPA had previously recommended that North Carolina develop one, but we haven\u2019t.\"\n\u2018Hogwash\u2019\nMichael Mallin, a research professor at UNC-Wilmington, has conducted research on eastern NC rivers and co-authored the 2016 report \"Environmental Assessment of the Lower Cape Fear River System.\" At the time, Mallin noted high concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus at three sites in the Black River.\nMallin checks the nutrients monthly and \"often\" finds nitrogen and phosphorus levels to be higher than the level that scientists would consider healthy, he said in a phone interview.\nHe called the Black River\u2019s ORW classification \"outdated.\" Ryke Longest, director of the Duke Environmental Law and Policy Clinic, went a step further.\n\"But the claim that this proves there are no water quality problems caused by hog farms is pure hogwash,\" Longest said in an email. \"The truth is the Black River may be much more polluted than we know because it lacks sufficient monitoring stations to check its status.\"\nLongest, McCallie and Will Hendrick, staff attorney for the N.C. Waterkeeper Alliance, scoffed at Troxler\u2019s suggestion that hog waste isn\u2019t affecting the Black River and that the river\u2019s water quality is among the state\u2019s best.\n\"What Troxler is saying is that because it\u2019s classified at the top, its quality is at the top. But just because you say the quality should be good at this place doesn\u2019t mean it is,\" Hendrick said. \"It has the ORW classification. But that says nothing at all about the current water quality. Period.\"\nOur rating\nTroxler cast doubt on the effect of hog farms, saying the Black River\u2019s water \"is rated at the very top in North Carolina.\" While the Black River has an \"outstanding\" designation with the state, its environmental regulatory agency says the label doesn\u2019t mean the river is one of the cleanest in the state. And experts say the state probably would find other\u00a0harmful nutrients\u00a0\u2014 if only it tested for them.
