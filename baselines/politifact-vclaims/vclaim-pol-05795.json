John Kasich talked about bringing down college costs, prompting Jeb Bush to chime in about the low cost of tuition in Florida.\n\"We don't need the federal government to be involved in this, because when they do, we create a $1.2 trillion debt,\" said the former Florida governor during the Oct. 28 debate in Boulder, Colo. \"In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state, because there's accountability, just as John (Kasich) said. You'll create a much better graduation rate at a lower cost, and you won't indebt the next generation with recourse debt on their backs.\"\nWe wanted to know: Does Florida hold the No. 1 spot for lowest in-state college tuition?\nComparison of in-state tuition\nBush spokesman Matt Gorman said that when Bush left office in 2007, Florida had the lowest in-state tuition for a public four-year university among the 50 states. The data from the College Board bears that out: It was $3,881 for a four-year public university in 2006-07.\nBut during the debate, Bush didn\u2019t say he was referring to when he ended his tenure as governor \u2014 he made it sound like he was talking in the present tense, so we looked at that data, too.\nThe College Board publishes an annual comparison of in-state tuition and fees at four-year public universities nationwide, comprised of survey data from almost 4,000 postsecondary institutions. The comparison refers to average price paid by a full-time student for one year of undergraduate enrollment.\nFor 2014-15, the lowest was Wyoming at $4,646, followed by Arkansas at $6,138; Utah at $6,177; New Mexico at $6,190; Montana at $6,279, and then Florida at $6,351. So Florida was the sixth-lowest, although four of the states were only between $72 and $213 cheaper than Florida.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Florida is one of the most affordable states for public university tuition,\" said Ralph Aiello, who supervises college counselors for Broward County public schools in Florida.\nThe College Board produces a similar report comparing tuition for two-year degrees which showed that Florida was again on the low end but not at the cheapest spot in 2014-15.\n\"There are a number of reasons for the wide variation in published tuition and fees by state \u2014 state tuition philosophy, aid policy, economic conditions, and funding for higher education,\" said Jennifer Ma, the College Board\u2019s policy research scientist. \"For example, New Hampshire, which has the highest published tuition and fees for the public four-year sector in 2014-15, does not have a state grant aid program and has the lowest state appropriations on a per-student basis.\"\nBush specifically mentioned \"tuition,\" but we\u2019ll note that there are a lot of factors than influence the ultimate price tag for students, including fees, scholarships, financial aid and room and board.\nOur ruling\nBush said, \"In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state.\"\nThat\u2019s not accurate if we look at 2014-15 tuition for four-year public universities compiled by the College Board. That data shows Wyoming had the lowest tuition followed by Arkansas, Utah, New Mexico, Montana and Florida. Florida was the sixth-lowest.\nBush\u2019s campaign said he was referring to Florida\u2019s ranking as the lowest in 2006-07 when he left office, but he didn\u2019t specify that timeframe during the debate.\nWe rate this statement Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05795"}
