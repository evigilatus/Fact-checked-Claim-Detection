The heat is on National Football Commissioner Roger Goodell for his discipline... former Ray Ryan Rice Baltimore, who was shown in a leaked video last week. The release of the video led more voices to question Rice &apos; s initial comment of the two games as being too lenient, including Goodell, who announced Rice &apos; s indefinite suspension amid the repercussions of the video. For some athletes and defenders of victims, this is not enough to prove that Goodell is real in punishing players accused of domestic violence. The writer in the Washington Post Mike Weiss says that Goodell should lose his job in the state of the Union in CNN. \"The thing that bothers me the most is Roger Goodell at some point tried to play basically the marriage counselor with the victim and the offender, Janai and Ray Rice,\" said Weiss. \"Place the victim and the perpetrator together. Each domestic violence agency, each law enforcement agency, has been rejected.\" She continued: \"She is sitting, telling her story to the person who basically abused her. And this tone that shows me that this commissioner does not take domestic violence seriously enough.\" Did Goodell talk to the victim, Janie Rice, with Ray Ray Rice? Does this violate the policy of domestic violence advocacy organizations and law enforcement agencies? A spokesman for the national armed forces refused to comment on the meeting, citing the investigation by former FBI Director Robert Mueller into the actions of the national armed forces. The meeting was held on 16 June at the headquarters of the National Armed Forces in New York, three months after the Grand Jury in New Jersey charged Rice with aggravated assault of the third degree of the elevator accident. Ray Rice, who married Janae Rice on March 28, was admitted to the pre-trial intervention program to avoid time behind bars in May. The purpose of the mid-June meeting was to discuss disciplinary action taken by the national armed forces. Peter King hacked into the first details of the meeting, citing unknown internal sources that did not contradict the National Football Association. The meeting included not only Goodell, Ray and Janai Rice, but also Director-General Ozzie Niussom, President Ravens Dick Cass and two executives of the National Armed Forces, as mentioned by the King. At the meeting, Guanay Rice was asked to be lenient with Ray Ray Rice, and the source told him that primary discipline could ruin the march back. On July 24, the National Football Association announced that it would suspend Rice for only two games, sparking early waves of criticism. The King's story is important because it guided the next choir of columns and packagings that struck Goodell not to speak to the couple separately. The People &apos; s Sports Code was quoted by two advocates for victims of domestic violence - Renee Reynick, Vice-President of Programmes and Emerging Issues with the National Network to End Domestic Violence, and counsel for Victoria Christianson from the AEquitas Resource Group - who said that Godell &apos; s meeting with the couple was inappropriate. \"So having two of them in the room and thinking that they could speak freely in that kind of situation is crazy,\" said Renk Didsbane. \"It's impossible to speak freely.\" And if there was any chance that she was scared or forced, she couldn't have said it. Maybe you're in great danger.\" A columnist in the Ravens newspaper, Dan Roderix of Baltimore Sun, interviewed a social worker and a local consultant who echoed this point. A column was also written by Hakeem on July 29, which dealt with more details about Judith's meeting with the couple than was discussed on CNN. In an interview with Bondet Fuckett, Wes said that the meeting was \"morally irresponsible\" and showed that Godell's background lacked vocational training in mental health. \"I have no surprise whatsoever about maintaining that law enforcement agencies and domestic violence advocates generally supported the failure to interview both the perpetrator and the aggressors, especially when deciding on disciplinary matters for the perpetrator,\" said Weise. He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. On January 12, 2021, Law Enforcement Policy Ruth M. Glen, Interim Executive Director of the National Coalition against Domestic Violence, confirmed to Bondet Fuckett what other domestic violence advocates had said to other news organizations: Goodell should not have spoken to Janai Rice in front of her husband. Glenn said: \"When that incident is reviewed and investigated, whatever it may be, there should never be an opportunity where this investigation occurs when both are present.\" \"Sure, it makes no difference if it happened one day ago.\" Glen said that the domestic violence prevention community had for years pressed law enforcement agencies to adopt policies calling for interviews with victims and suspects separately (e.g. model policies and checklists here). We have found many examples of law enforcement agencies that explicitly state the separation of the victim, suspect and witnesses involved in the conflict, including Santa Clara Province (Califf), Kentucky, Michigan, South Carolina and New Jersey. (We did not have time to verify each province or state by the deadline, and the United States Department of Justice did not provide a comment, but we are satisfied to say that this policy is widespread. Professor of Law at Stanford University Robert Weisberg observed that investigators always cross-examine witnesses separately. However, while separation may be required in the immediate aftermath of the incident, it is not always maintained throughout the legal process, as stated by Charles H. Rose III, Stetson School of Law, Stetson University. Sometimes couples are interviewed in domestic violence cases so that officials can judge how they behave with each other. \"At the time that Goodell was involved they no longer needed to be questioned separately,\" said Rose. \"In fact, the wagons were already in circulation.\" Nor did the wise men say that Goodell had not initiated an investigation in the area of law enforcement. This has already happened. \"You can't apply the law enforcement model to an employment case,\" said Rose. \"Different standards, different law, different consequences.\" Perhaps Godell's purpose in speaking to Ray and Janai Rice was not similar to that of investigating law enforcement, and James Acker, a professor at the Albany-Sone School of Criminal Justice, warned. \"If, then for the same reasons, such a joint debate is likely not to be appropriate,\" Acker said. \"On the other hand, as far as I know, the context was quite different. Maybe Goodell already got a factual novel somewhere else; maybe he wanted to try to measure the relationship of the Rices and try to make an impression on them together.\" Our judgment is in trouble with the Godel meeting with Ray and Janai Rice together while Goodell sought information about the February elevator incident and subsequent events that would benefit Rice's discipline by the League. Firstly, there was no discussion that the meeting had been held, as it had been widely reported and had not been contested by the National Football Union. Second, Weiss also claimed that \"in every domestic violence agency, every law enforcement agency\" such a meeting would be a \"no.\" And that's true for the most part, even though we talked to experts who asked if this was the right parallel to drawing. The interrogation of victims in isolation from suspects in cases of domestic violence appears to be a widespread practice encouraged by domestic violence advocates and numerous police and State policies after the incident. But Goodell wasn't conducting a criminal investigation -- which actually happened, and he was able to access that information. There are also occasions when couples involved in domestic violence cases are interviewed later, allowing the police and prosecutors to judge how they are dealing with each other so that they can assess credibility and the possibility of prosecution, as one expert told us. Regardless of whether the comparison is appropriate, the demand of the wise is accurate but requires clarification or additional information. We're mostly assessing it right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07306"}
