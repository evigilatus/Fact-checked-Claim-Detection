In a policy paper published in a municipal hall in Houston, Baiden said, \"The current ratio of the school psychologist to the students in this country is about 1,400 to 1, while experts say that it should be at most 700 to 1.\" This is important because mental health care problems in children are often detected in schools. School psychologists provide the first line of treatment and often initiate any necessary referrals to specialists. Their role is complicated by the fact that there is a serious shortage of adolescent psychiatrists and children outside the school walls. Paiden said that the problem is that \"many of our children do not receive the mental health care they need from a trained professional.\" This point about the proportions of psychiatrists in schools points to a stark gap in health-care services, and in an area where there is only a greater need. With that in mind, we decided to dig in. We reached out to the Biden press team for comment, but we never answered it. It appears that a controversial person, Biden, uses a number promoted by the National Association of School Psychologists, a Washington-based business group. This census comes from the 2015 membership survey, which found 1,381 to 1 students to psychologists - about 1,400. But this account isn't strict. Although the Association sent the survey to a representative sample at the national level, the requirement for participants to send their responses to others affected the results of the survey. \"There are always restrictions when you have a self-reporting process. These restrictions are recognized, \"Eric Rosen, Director of Professional Development and Standards of the Association, said. \"For the time being, this is our best data. It's not perfect, but it's the best there is.\" There are figures and other sources that should also be considered. The Ministry of Education sent us data from the National Survey of Teachers and Principal Teachers 2015-16. Some 49 million children were enrolled in public schools and, nationwide, some 44,210 full-time psychologists were employed in schools. This results in a ratio of approximately 1,115 to 1, still far from what the experts say, but slightly less than 1,400. This is due at least in part to the fact that the survey conducted by the DOE does not distinguish between a school psychologist - a specific specialization in the field - and any other kind of psychiatrist that the school may use. This category may include specialties such as clinical, developmental, cognitive or child psychology, among others. The designated operational entity tracks the extent to which schools use guidance counsellors, nurses, psychologists, social workers, speech healers and \"other professionals.\" (If these figures are calculated, they will achieve a more favourable ratio.) On January 14, 2021, Chuck Grasley stated in a tweet that insulin prices had \"lost the RoOOF for patients/taxpayers bc from the manufacturer, a health plan and PBM Biz practices.\" \u2022 February 2, 2012 - Are these distinctions important? The Association states yes, arguing that school psychologists are trained in a way that gives them specific and distinct advantages in surfacing the educational system - for example, helping teachers adapt their work to improve the education of children with learning disorders - and that they better understand school-specific concerns such as discipline, prevention of violence and helping families adapt to school culture. However, it is not a matter of settlement. \"Psychiatrist at school is great. I would like to say even a consultant, a therapist, and a social worker - there are any number of potential healers who have the skills and can detect and refer to these issues,\" said Dr. Brian Greenfield, a pediatric psychiatrist who runs the emergency psychiatric service at Montreal Children's Hospital, who researched the mental health of children in the United States. There is an increasing need, but there is no one solution that says, whatever number you look at, that Paden's biggest point seems true... that children do not have enough access to mental health care in schools. Rossum said that the ratio of 700 to 1 in Biden's inspiration also comes from an analysis conducted by the Association. The group considered previous surveys and found that school psychologists were better able to take care of students when the ratio ranged from 500 to 1 to 700 to at least 1. The ratios of 1,115 and 1,400 mask wide disparities at the national level. Data from the DOE indicate that more than 13 million students go to school without any staff psychiatrist. More than 1 million students go to schools where they have not only a psychiatrist, but also no guidance counselor or social worker. For its part, the Association &apos; s data show that in some parts of the country the ratio can reach the level of one school psychologist per 4,000 students. The consequences are great. Evidence suggests that children suffer from high rates of mental health problems. For example, research published in April showed that the number of children reporting suicidal thoughts in the emergency room increased significantly between 2007 and 2015. (Grenfeld, Montreal psychologist, co-author of that paper.) Preventive mental health care can help to address this trend. Most students receiving such care receive at least their first assessment in schools. If there's no one in the hand to offer it, it's likely to go without it. However, Greenfield noticed, the school psychologist is only one part of the team. Many school staff can be trained to observe when there is a mistake. The next step was likely to be more important: to refer the child to a clinic or other specialized mental health care settings. This brings with it a range of challenges, such as the national shortage of paediatric psychiatrists. He said, \"Bravo for our politicians who have this in their heads and want to eat it, but we can't expect one psychiatrist at school to be able to do it all, even if I increase the ratio at school.\" :: Our appreciation for the specific allegations made by Biden regarding the ratios of school psychologists to students is correct, and it reflects a major problem for the mental health of adolescents and children. However, the focus on psychologists at school alone does not cover the whole issue. Given the broader point - that many children do not have access to mental health care in schools - his statement will benefit from more contexts. Children may not have a \"school psychologist,\" but they may still attend a school where another type of psychologist or mental health specialist works. This means that they can still receive care from \"trained professionals,\" although the care provider does not have the same level of specialized training. Paiden &apos; s claim is accurate but requires additional information. We're mostly assessing it right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00569"}
