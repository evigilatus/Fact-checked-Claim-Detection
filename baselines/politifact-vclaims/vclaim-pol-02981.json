John Moorlach have railed against Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown for signing a gas tax increase earlier this year.\nThe Orange County lawmaker took his criticism a step further in a recent op-ed in which he predicted the gas tax hike, combined with California\u2019s cap-and-trade extension, would boost gas prices so much that thieves would start siphoning fuel from cars.\nMoorlach went on to declare that crime has been on the rise under Brown.\n\"Crime has been getting worse since Jerry Brown was elected governor,\" Moorlach wrote in the Aug. 4 piece in the Sacramento Bee. \"The Bee reported, three-quarters of California\u2019s largest cities saw violent crime rise in 2015, with Sacramento\u2019s up 25 percent.\"\nWe\u2019ve fact-checked similar claims about increasing crime rates from other California lawmakers including State Sen. Jeff Stone of Riverside County and Assemblyman Travis Allen, an Orange County Republican running for governor.\nThere\u2019s been some truth in those claims, but those who made them also ignored key context or distorted the facts.\nWe wondered how Moorlach\u2019s statement, specifically the portion about crime getting worse since Brown was elected, stacked up.\nCalifornia crime trends\nBefore diving into the senator\u2019s claim, here\u2019s some background on California crime trends.\nLike the rest of the United States, California has experienced a dramatic long-term reduction in crime over the past several decades.\nBetween 1980 and 2015, the state\u2019s overall crime rate declined by about 60 percent, according to the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office.\nSOURCE: California Legislative Analyst's Office.\u00a0\nThe property crime rate peaked in California at nearly 7,000 crimes per 100,000 population in the early 1980s. Three decades later, it had dropped by more than half.\nThe violent crime rate saw a similar dramatic drop during this period.\nMoorlach\u2019s claim\nIn his op-ed, Moorlach focuses on crime \"since Jerry Brown was elected governor.\"\nWe took that to mean Brown\u2019s current stretch as governor, which started with his election to a third term in 2010 and continued with re-election to a fourth term in 2014.\nBrown served his first two terms as governor from 1975 to 1983.\nFor this current stretch, we looked at crime data from 2010 through 2016, the most current year available. We also considered the period 2010 through 2015 because Moorlach\u2019s spokesman said the senator did not have had access to a California Department of Justice report on crime for 2016, given that it was released two weeks after his op-ed published.\nNo matter the exact years selected, California\u2019s crime story during over the past half decade is not as simple as Moorlach\u2019s statement implies.\nThe statewide crime rate, which measures both violent and property crimes, ticked up in 2012 and 2015. It decreased, however, in the other four years during Brown\u2019s current stint.\nThis overall crime rate includes violent and property crimes. Violent crimes are homicides, rapes, robberies and aggravated assaults. Examples of property crimes include burglary, theft and vandalism.\nJonathan Peterson, a fiscal and policy analyst at the California Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office, cautioned that year-over-year changes can make it look like crime is growing rapidly, \"but it could be a blip.\"\nPeterson said the past six to seven years have been marked by fluctuations in California\u2019s crime rate, not a steady increase or decrease.\nStanford Law School Professor John Donohue, who researches crime trends, said Moorlach's claim might contain an element of truth but overall is flawed.\u00a0\n\"One has to be very cautious about politicians making statements about crime because they will often try to make the numbers say something that isn\u2019t quite representative,\" said Donohue.\u00a0\"The broad trend for the last 25 years has been down and very benign. Crime is at a much lower level in practically every place today than it was 25 years ago. But in the last couple years there has been an uptick (in California and nationwide), and that\u2019s a reason for concern.\"\nDeeper look at crime data\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin Nunes\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in an interview on Fox\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRepublicans have no way to communicate\u201d after tech companies cut off Parler.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Amy Sherman \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo fact-check Moorlach\u2019s claim about crime getting worse, we examined statistics from the California Department of Justice\u2019s recent report Crime in California 2016. It includes crime rate data from 1966 through 2016.\nThe data show that from 2010 through 2015, the most recent year from which Moorlach likely drew his conclusions, California\u2019s overall crime rate declined slightly from 3,069 crimes per 100,000 population to 3,047 crimes per 100,000.\nThis casts doubt on Moorlach\u2019s claim that crime has been getting worse.\nEven when examining the violent crime rate alone, the results are mixed. In three of the years since Brown was elected, the violent crime rate notched up, while it dipped in the the other three years.\nHad Moorlach narrowed his claim to 2011, Brown\u2019s first year back as governor, through 2015, the crime story would be slightly different. California\u2019s overall crime rate inched up between those years, from 3,007 crimes per 100,000 population to 3,047 per 100,000.\nMoorlach\u2019s response\nSen. Moorlach\u2019s spokesman provided us with links to about a half-dozen news articles that detailed crime increases across California. None of the articles, however, showed a sustained increase from 2010 through 2016.\nIn his op-ed, Moorlach cited a spike in violent crime in 2015. He\u2019s right for that single year for that type of crime: state justice department figures show an 8.4 percent rise in violent crime in 2015 compared with the prior year.\nIn recent months, politicians such as Assemblyman Allen have pointed to this period as evidence for growing crime concern in California.\nMany have cited a PPIC analysis comparing the first half of 2014 to the same period in 2015. It found widespread increases in crime rates in California cities with a population greater than 100,000. Of the 66 California cities that size, 49 saw an increase in violent crime and 48 experienced increases in property crime. Many saw double digit percent increases.\nA subsequent report comparing the first half of 2016 with the first half of 2015 showed overall crime decreasing, driven by a drop in property crimes. That report was published by the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice, a policy research group that makes recommendations on alternatives to incarceration.\nTwo weeks after Moorlach\u2019s op-ed was published, the California Department of Justice released statewide crime statistics for 2016.\nThat report showed a slight decrease in the total crime rate, driven by a nearly 3 percent decline in the property crime rate. Violent crime, meanwhile, increased about 4 percent in 2016. We won\u2019t use these statistics as a determining factor in our rating for Moorlach\u2019s claim since his spokesman said the senator didn\u2019t have the report.\nThe 2016 data, however, appear to support the idea that crime has not followed a consistent pattern in California over the past half dozen years.\nOur rating\nRepublican State Sen. John Moorlach recently claimed \"crime has been getting worse since Jerry Brown was elected governor.\"\nHis spokesman pointed to news articles that cite an uptick in crime in 2015, when many large cities in California saw double-digit increases in violent crime. But neither those articles nor state crime reports show a sustained increase from the time of Brown was elected governor in 2010 through the current period.\nIn fact, there was a slight decrease in the state\u2019s overall crime rate from 2010 through 2015, the most recent year Moorlach was likely referring to.\nCrime researchers emphasized that California and the nation have experienced a dramatic decrease in crime in recent decades. They say California\u2019s crime rate increases in 2012 and in 2015, however, are reason for concern but are not evidence that crime has gotten worse over the past half dozen years.\nWe rate Moorlach\u2019s claim Mostly False.\n\nMOSTLY FALSE \u2013\u00a0The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.\nAfter the Fact:\u00a0\nMoorlach responds to crime fact check\u00a0\nAfter our fact-check published, Sen. Moorlach responded by saying crime has increased in California under Gov. Jerry Brown if one looks at a more narrow period, from 2011 through 2015.\nWe used 2010 as a baseline for our research given that Moorlach\u2019s original statement said \"crime has been getting worse since Jerry Brown was elected governor.\"\nVoters elected Brown governor in November 2010 and he took office in January 2011.\nUsing 2010 as a baseline both adhered to Moorlach\u2019s original timeframe and gave us a chance to examine how the crime rate had changed under Brown compared with the year immediately preceding his governorship.\nMoorlach correctly points out on Twitter that: \"Your own report admits crime increased from 2011-2015, a very large period of Gov. Brown's time in office.\" He also emphasized this point in a blog post on Medium.com.\nAs we pointed out in the fact check, the crime rate has fluctuated during Brown\u2019s tenure. It increased in 2012 and again in 2015, provoking concern from politicians and those who research crime trends. The other four years under Brown, however, the crime rate has decreased.\nIn the end, when one measures the overall crime rate from 2010 through 2015 and through 2016, both fuller pictures of Brown\u2019s time in office, there\u2019s a slight decrease.\nOur rating remains the same.\nClick here for\u00a0more\u00a0on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.\n Share the Facts 2017-08-23 23:38:17 UTC   PolitiFact    3 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly False  https://www.sacbee.com/opinion/op-ed/soapbox/article165084497.html \"Crime has been getting worse since Jerry Brown was elected governor.\"    John Moorlach California State Senator    Friday, August 4, 2017 2017-08-04    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02981"}
