Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media site\u2019s efforts to curb fake news.\nThe story said that 17 SEAL teams struck multiple targets, and that \"in three hours time, the entire military infrastructure of that country has been eliminated,\" according to a reporter. Kim was reportedly killed, although state media played a \"death to America\" speech recorded years ago, the article said.\nKim Jong Un\u2019s death has not been reported widely because this coordinated attack did not happen. The story is fake. (The photo showing a North Korean city on fire is actually a British hospital burning.)\nIt originated on July 23 on TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a website run by a self-described liberal troll who creates absurd news stories in an attempt to fool conservative readers.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA footnote on the bottom of the website said that \"everything on this site is a satirical work of fiction.\" The warning is repeated in the About Us section, where a disclaimer reads, \"We present fiction as fact and our sources don\u2019t actually exist.\"\nThis isn\u2019t the first time TheLastLineOfDefense.org has posted a story that said Kim was dead. The site posted a story on July 6 that said an American sniper had killed the North Korean leader \u2014 we ruled that claim Pants On Fire!\nIt\u2019s not immediately apparent why the site would post essentially the same story just a couple of weeks apart. We attempted to contact TheLastLineOfDefense.org to see if a fictional assassination of Kim Jong Un would be a regular occurrence on the site, but didn\u2019t get a response.\nJust like the last time the site killed Kim, we rate this Pants On Fire!\n Share the Facts 2017-08-04 19:10:47 UTC   PolitiFact    1 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Pants on Fire  \"Kim Jong Un killed in (President Donald) Trump\u2019s overnight black op attack on North Korea.\"    Internet rumors bloggers   in Internet posts Friday, July 28, 2017 2017-07-28    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03030"}
