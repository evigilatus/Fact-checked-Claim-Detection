Fact-checkers have debunked the claim that the National Guard is only in areas that tend to vote for Democrats.\u00a0\nThe Military Times reported Nov. 2 that the National Guard has deployed more than 3,600 troops in 16 states. Among them are several states that are expected to swing in Trump\u2019s favor on Election Night, including Alabama and Tennessee. Those states also have Republican governors, which are generally the ones to decide whether to bring in the National Guard or not.\nIn Texas, National Guard troops could be sent to cities like Houston, Dallas, Fort Worth, Austin and San Antonio, according to the Military Times.\u00a0\nThe Instagram post is inaccurate. We rate it False.\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections\u00a0FactChat\u00a0#Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click\u00a0here, for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18431"}
