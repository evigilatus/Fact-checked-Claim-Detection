When asked to support the statement, a senator &apos; s spokesperson referred to data from the Trade Records Exchange Centre at Syracuse University, which maintained figures on the number of individuals who had left a particular State at the time of their deportation and provided a classification of their most serious criminal conviction, if any, by the Institute. In the first 11 months of fiscal year 2018, 853 individuals were deported from Illinois, 160 of whom were classified as having received serious criminal convictions, according to data from the Centre, obtained through requests for public records from the Institute. The Agency classifies crime codes into three levels, the most serious of which covers what it considers to be \"aggravated crimes,\" a list of crimes under the Federal Immigration Act that have expanded over the years and include both violent and non-violent crimes. This represents less than 20 per cent of all deportations from Illinois, as claimed by Dorbin. However, the data have some limitations. While Susan Long, Director of the Centre, referred to the same data set as Dorbin, she added an important warning. She said: \"How to define the deportation of Illinois, as well as what is considered to be \"charged of any serious crime\" will make a difference.\" Other experts contacted to a similar point indicated that the place where the individual left the country was not necessarily the place where he or she had resided before his or her arrest or even where he or she had been arrested before his or her deportation. These are the details that the Institute does not provide, according to Long. On January 27, 2021, Marco Rubio says in his remarks: \"Only in the Third World do you see this routine use of the trials of former leaders\" by Miriam Valferde, 29 January 2021, \"The removal data set tells you nothing about a person's history,\" said Guillermo Cantor, Research Director of the US Migration Board, a non-profit immigration advocate, who also analysed deportation data from the Institute. \"You only know where the person was deported from... but that doesn't make much sense in terms of analysis, because this person may have been staying anywhere in the country.\" As Cantor and others have pointed out, the data may represent arrests several years ago, which means that they may not say much about the Agency &apos; s current policies under the Trump administration, which was the focus of Dorbin &apos; s criticism. Randy Caps, a research director at the Institute for Migration Policy, said, \"The deportees from Illinois may have been arrested by the Institute three years ago in some cases.\" He referred to the Centre &apos; s data listing the backlog of pending deportation cases, which showed that the cases in Illinois had been open in 2018 for an average of 963 days. The waiting time has been slightly reduced since then. Furthermore, the limited figures provided by the Immigration and Naturalization Authority to the Anti-Terrorism Organization and others show that the share of deportations involving convictions for what the Agency considers to be serious crimes was also relatively small during Obama years - ranging from a 12.4% decrease for all deportations outside Illinois in 2009 to a high 24.1% in 2015, after the Obama administration shifted its focus to individuals likely to pose a threat to public safety. Another set of federal statements maintained by the organization provided a more up-to-date picture of enforcement trends in each state under Trump. It shows that the arrests of non-citizens under serious convictions in Illinois by the Immigration and Naturalization Authority fell from more than one third of the total number in 2015 to just over five in 2018. At the same time, the proportion of arrests involving individuals without prior criminal convictions increased from 11 per cent to 43 per cent. Our verdict, Dorbin, said that in Illinois, less than 20% of the deported immigrants were charged with any serious crime. This is supported by a limited number of federal staff, but comes with some warnings - most notably, the number available includes all individuals who left Illinois at the time of their deportation. This means that they may have resided and been arrested in a state other than Illinois before leaving the country. We're evaluating Durbin's claim mostly true. It is almost true that the statement is accurate but requires further clarification or information.
