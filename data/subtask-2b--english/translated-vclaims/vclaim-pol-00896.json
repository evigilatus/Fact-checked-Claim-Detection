Gavin Newsome said that the number of persons sentenced to death in the state was not in line with its more recent efforts to reform the criminal justice system. In a press conference in the Capitol on Wednesday, Newsome said, \"Penol swings in a new direction,\" adding that the state was moving away from its rigid approach to crime and \"excessive imprisonment\" in the 1980s and 1990s. The Governor then added a familiar allegation about the size of the death row in California. \"All the time we had this sore thumb that appeared in California. That is, we were claiming to have the largest execution suite in the Western Hemisphere. The largest execution wing in the United States of America -- twice the size of the following state: Florida.\" In 2016, we verified a similar allegation by Yes on 62 Campaigns to Abolish the Death Penalty in California. We've evaluated it right. In this fact check, we'll examine the current numbers and explain whether this expression, repeated by Newsome, is still accurate. It should be noted that Newsome's work does not eliminate those sentenced to death in California and does not change the sentence imposed on any prisoner. Instead, any execution shall be suspended while Newsome is in office. A future governor could re-impose the death penalty. Governors in other states, Colorado, Oregon and Pennsylvania, have already imposed a moratorium on executions. The State of Washington had imposed a similar moratorium, and last year the Supreme Court had abolished the death penalty there as \"arbitrary and racially biased,\" according to the Washington Post. In 2016, Californian voters rejected proposal 62, a measure to abolish the death penalty, with 46.9 per cent voting to end the executions and 53 per cent voting to maintain it. The voters agreed to proposal 66, a separate measure to speed up executions. Two months before those elections, a poll found that 48 per cent of potential voters supported the abolition of the death penalty, while 37 per cent were opposed and 15 per cent did not decide. As we mentioned three years ago, the size of California's death row remains impressive. The largest number of persons sentenced to death in the western hemisphere belong to states within the United States, and not to separate countries, Robert Dunham, Executive Director of the Death Penalty Information Centre, told us at the time. The non-profit organization Washington, D.C., is an authority dealing with the subject matter of the death penalty and opposes the death penalty. California has fewer death rows than those sentenced to death throughout the United States. But experts say that those sentenced to death in the United States are classified individually by state, not as a complete patriot, leaving California far from the rest of the states. We used a similar explanation for the allegation during our examination of its accuracy. In a telephone interview today, Dunham confirmed that there had been no major shift in ranking, and that California still had the largest total in the western hemisphere, followed by Florida and Texas. This confirms the first part of Nisum's claim. Devin Nunes reported on January 10, 2021 in an interview on \"The Republicans have no means of communication\" after the Barler tech companies were cut off. \u2022 On January 13, 2012, 737 prisoners were sentenced to death in California on March 12, 2019. This has been slightly lower than it was 746 years ago. No one has been executed by the State for more than a decade because of legal challenges, but the population has been reduced by suicide and natural deaths. In comparison, Florida executed more than 30 people over the past decade and Texas killed more than 100 prisoners during that period. Despite a small drop in the total number of death row inmates in California, according to current figures from the State Correctional Agency, there are still more than twice as many inmates on death row in Florida as 343. This confirms the second part of the Newsome statement. There is no comparison in the western hemisphere here of what Dunham told us about comparisons with other countries in the hemisphere. \"Most of the western hemisphere has abolished the death penalty. Besides the United States, the retentionist countries are Cuba, Guatemala and Guyana, and then countries in the Caribbean. None of them have been sentenced to death from a distance such as the size of California or even Florida.\" Dunham told us in 2016. Canada abolished the death penalty in 1976; Mexico abolished it in 2005. Dunham asserted that there had been no significant change between these countries. Our government. Gavin Newsome repeated the claim that California's death row \"is the largest in the western hemisphere. The largest execution wing in the United States of America -- twice the size of the following state: Florida.\" We assessed a similar claim as valid in 2016. At that time, we noted that most countries in the western hemisphere had abolished the death penalty and that many American States had significantly higher death rows than the few remaining countries still using the death penalty. Experts say that those sentenced to death in the United States are arranged individually, and that the arrangement has not changed in recent years. The 737 prisoners sentenced to death in California belong largely to other states, as well as to countries in the western hemisphere. The Newsome newspaper repeated the rest of the statement, both accurate and terrible. We value his claim right. The truth is - the statement is accurate and nothing important is missing.
