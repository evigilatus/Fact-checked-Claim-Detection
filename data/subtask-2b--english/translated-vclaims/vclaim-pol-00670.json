Brooke Baldwin, April 30, \"while one in five Americans can't afford prescription drugs when doctors prescribe them.\" The Senate member of Vermont and the candidate for the Democratic Presidency often raised the inability to afford drugs, and the result he used in his exchange with Baldwin was almost identical to his words during his event at CNN Hall a few days earlier. As part of our ongoing effort to verify health-care talking points in the presidential election, we took a closer look at whether one in five people could not afford the drugs they prescribed. \u2022 The most reliable data show that about 10 per cent of people say that the cost of medicines imposes considerable hardship. \u2022 Some 20-30 percent say that they did not take medication because of the cost, as recommended by the doctor. \u2022 Approximately one in three people is using some strategy to reduce the cost of prescription drugs, which includes requesting medicine cheaper than their doctor. Not all surveys are established on an equal basis. One of the most reliable studies is the National Survey of Health Interviews conducted by the Government. It reached about 25,000 households, and in 2017 he asked her how she tried to reduce the cost of the medicines she had prescribed. About 11 per cent said that they did not take medication as described. This may include not filling out a prescription or extending their prescription by not taking as much medicine as they should. If this is the measure of affordability, one in ten, not one in five, cannot afford his medicines. However, the survey revealed other strategies to reduce the costs that drive the fracture higher. About 5% said they were using alternative treatments, and about 20% said they were asking their doctor for cheaper medication. Another well-evaluated survey confirms the findings of the Government, adding some wrinkles that make it difficult to draw simple conclusions. In February, the Kaiser Family Foundation, a reliable source of impartial health policy data, stated that 9 per cent of respondents said that it was very difficult to afford their prescription drugs. On January 13, 2021, bloggers announced the extraordinary truth-checking story in which General David H. Berger, the commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Pelosi's request to use the Marines to install security, saying, \"We're not working for you.\" By Samantha Buterman: January 17, 2021, but another 15% said it was difficult. This is based on drug users receiving prescriptions. Of all adults, 6% say it's very difficult and 9% say it's kind of hard to carry their meds. These findings highlight the ambiguity surrounding the Sanders statement. There is no precise point where the drug cannot afford it. Stacey Duzitzina, a professor of health policy at Vanderbilt University, said, \"Where there is difficulty in paying for the medicine that is not itself the inability to afford it at all, it can be relevant and can lead to a non-compliance with the costs - the failure to take drugs as stipulated.\" \"In some cases, this can be worse for people than not taking drugs at all.\" Dozitzina, and the Sanders Policy Group, referred to another part of the Caesar's survey that asked whether people had not filled a prescription because of the cost. About 20% answered, yes. Another 12% said they took a dose or cut their pills in half. \"It is very difficult to define affordability, especially for drugs,\" said the Pittsburgh University Pharmacy Professor, Mmecolada Hern\u00e1ndez. \"It is very important goods because they can save lives, so people may give up using other services or products to bear their costs.\" Hernandez said that if people make fun of basics such as food or clothing to pay for their drugs, it basically means that affordability is a big problem. On the other hand, Caesar's survey data suggest that people may not see every prescription as vital to their health. Of those who did not take a prescription as recommended, two thirds said that their condition had not worsened. The third survey came from Gallup, which produced a report on Western Health, a group focusing on reducing health-care costs for older persons. Gallup found that about 20% of people said that sometime last year, they were \"unable to pay for drugs or drugs\" because they \"didn't have enough money to pay for them.\" In view of this and Kaiser &apos; s data, Stanford University &apos; s health policy professor Michelle Mellow said that almost 30% of people do not take medical medication as recommended due to cost. She said, \"Sanders estimates on the low side.\" Our judge Sanders said that one in five people couldn't pay for prescription drugs. There's some evidence of this. About 20% of the people in Caesar's scan said they didn't fill out a prescription because of the cost, and 12% said they took less than the prescription. However, it is difficult to measure affordability. Only about 10 percent said it was very difficult to pay for their medication. Another 15 percent said it was hard. These are subjective terms, neither of which says that people went completely without their meds. The experts we reached said that affordability was an important issue. The survey data are not fully consistent with Sanders' words, but they support the idea that many are being pressured to pay for their medicines. We're mostly assessing this claim right.
