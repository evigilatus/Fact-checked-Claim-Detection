Here, we look at Obama\u2019s Vietnam claim.\nLabor law\nBefore diving into what the TPP asks of Vietnam, let\u2019s look at what protections Vietnam already affords workers. The 2013 Vietnamese Constitution provides for \"break policies,\" \"equal and safe\" work conditions and protects against \"discrimination, forced labor\" and under-age workers.\nIt also establishes trade unions to represent workers and protect their legal rights. According to a 2012 \"Law on Trade Unions,\" however, this is an entity \"placed under the leadership of the Communist Party of Vietnam.\" Essentially, all trade unions must affiliate with the Vietnam General Confederation of Labour.\nWe consulted various law firms that cover Vietnamese labor law, and they detailed Vietnam\u2019s already-existing labor protections. According to the the Southeast Asian law firm Tilleke & Gibbins, Vietnam sets a maximum of 48 hours per week and provides mandatory rest periods of at minimum 24 consecutive hours per week. Employers are required to provide protective equipment, and there is maternity leave typically around four months.\nThe labor law firm Fisher Phillips \u00a0classified Vietnam\u2019s labor law as \"employee-friendly.\" We spoke to White House representatives who acknowledged Vietnam had such provisions.\nSo, what then, was Obama referring to as \"unprecedented\" labor reforms?\nWork-in-progress\nThe White House pointed us to a \"consistency plan\" negotiated as part of the TPP, titled the \"United States \u2014 Vietnam Plan for the Enhancement of Trade and Labour Relations.\"\nKey to the plan is the decoupling of labor unions from the government. Workers must be allowed to spontaneously form a grassroots labour union.\u00a0The union must be registered, but not affiliated with, the government, thus allowing it to operate by its own rules and procedures.\n\"Vietnam shall ensure that its law does not mandate a labour union registered with the competent government body to operate according to the Statutes of Vietnam General Confederation of Labour,\" the plan states.\nExperts we spoke to said the term \"unprecedented\" is valid.\n\"The workers can form their own unions,\" said K. William Watson, a trade policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute. \"That's going to be a big change for Vietnam just because of the way it currently regulates labor unions. It\u2019s not going to be compatible with the TPP at all.\"\nJohn Sifton, Asia Advocacy director at Human Rights Watch, said independent unions are the first step to having workers enforce their own rights.\n\"This other stuff about minimum wage and working ours, all of that, is meaningless if you don\u2019t have unions,\" he said. \"Without unions, without the capacity to organize, whatever workers\u2019 rights are written down on paper don\u2019t have teeth.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBernie Sanders\n\n\nstated on April 4, 2016 in an interview with the New York Daily News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In Malaysia \u2026 many of the workers are indentured servants because their passports are taken away when they come into this country and are working in slave-like conditions.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Linda Qiu \u2022 April 12, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChanges to labor laws are still going through the country\u2019s legislative process, they said. While acknowledging that might be the case, Sifton said Obama\u2019s claim was \"premature\" for suggesting current changes.\n\"They\u2019ve signed up to a whole lot of things and if President Obama had simply said, \u2018Vietnam has promised and must do a whole bunch of things under the TPP,\u2019 then he would have been perfectly accurate,\" Sifton noted. \"But he made it sound like Vietnam has already started to do things and that\u2019s just not true.\"\nEnforcement\nChanging the law is one thing, but actually implementing it is another.\nPrior to the TPP entering into force, Vietnam must change its labor code to correspond with the side agreement, the White House explained. The plan also provides a review mechanism after-the-fact whereby the United States can impose higher tariffs on Vietnam if the provisions are not being implemented.\nNonetheless, experts questioned both the likelihood of Vietnam implementing the new rules and of the United States enforcing them. Both Sifton and Watson noted America\u2019s poor track record in enforcing other free trade agreements\u2019 labor provisions.\n\"They have a terrible record of enforcing labor chapters as evidenced by the Central American Free Trade Agreement and the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Colombian Free Trade Agreement,\" Sifton said. \"So he says they\u2019re enforceable and that\u2019s true on paper and its true technically, but it doesn\u2019t mean it would be be enforced.\"\nWatson, on the other hand, said it is in Vietnam\u2019s economic interest \u2014 due to their significant gains from the TPP \u2014 to abide by the proposed legal changes. In order to attract investors, they have to follow the rules and won\u2019t be too antagonistic to the agreement, he explained.\n\"It\u2019s not a situation where this was something that they didn\u2019t want and now they\u2019re going to try to sidestep it,\" he said. \"Vietnam is \u2014 economically \u2014 the country that will benefit the most from the TPP.\"\nVague language in the consistency plan could also hinder implementation, said Angie Ngoc Tran, a professor at California State University. In an article in New Mandala, she criticized the deal for not offering enough protection for independent unions and other procedural issues.\nOn the flip side,\u00a0Cathleen Cimino-Isaacs at the\u00a0Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the TPP has made progress to address past failures. The\u00a0Peterson Institute for International Economics has been described as a pro-trade economic policy group.\u00a0\n\"Although the TPP does not address all the concerns of labor rights advocates, it represents an important step forward,\" Cimino-Isaacs wrote. \"The bilateral plans negotiated alongside the TPP are a major innovative component, targeted to address the substandard labor conditions of most concern. Implementation of the mandated reforms would deliver signi\ufb01cant improvements in Brunei, Malaysia, and Vietnam. The monitoring mechanisms attached to Vietnam\u2019s plan in particular seem more proactive than past U.S. efforts.\"\nOur ruling\nObama said \"Vietnam is drafting and presenting unprecedented labor reforms\" and is \"changing their constitution to recognize worker organizations in Vietnam for the first time.\"\nThere are some problems with the claim.\nExperts said actual changes to the law have not happened yet but acknowledged the drafting process might be underway. They did agree, however, that the changes proposed would qualify as \"unprecedented.\"\nMore critically, they said it\u2019s hard to enforce the changes being described and the United States has a particularly poor track record of doing so.\nOn balance, we rate this claim Half True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/0b4621f6-693f-412e-9d5f-d66f11d089be\n(Update Aug. 5: This fact-check was updated to include\u00a0Cimino-Isaacs' comments.)", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04528"}
