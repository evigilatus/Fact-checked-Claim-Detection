Gov. Kathy Hochul said during a speech in late May.\n\"We have pay equity,\" said Hochul, who claimed women in New York state earn as much as twelve cents more on the dollar than the national average.\u00a0\"When you think about that wage gap, we all know it\u2019s 78 cents to the dollar. Well, in New York state it\u2019s 90 cents to the dollar.\"\nWhile New York state and most other states have laws mandating equal pay for employees, a wage gap between men and women persists.\nIs Hochul right about how narrow New York state\u2019s gender wage gap is compared to the national average?\nWhat the data shows\nHochul\u2019s numbers are in the ballpark of what federal data shows.\nWomen in New York state earn 86.9 percent as much as the median pay of men, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Women earn 81.1 percent as much as men overall in the U.S. The bureau tracked full-time, year-round workers in 2015, the most recent numbers.\nOnly three other states and Washington, D.C., have smaller gaps. Women in Hawaii earn 87.9 percent as much as men, the highest level.\nResearch from the National Women\u2019s Law Center places New York state higher. The center compared data from the U.S. Census Bureau on the median salary of full-time, year-round male and female employees in each state from 2015.\u00a0The census estimates show women in New York state earn 88.7 percent as much as men \u2014 more than any other state \u2014 compared with 79.6 percent overall in the U.S.\n\"The data sample sizes are larger using the [Census Bureau] community survey, which is why we and other organizations use it,\" said Maya Raghu, NWLC Director of Workplace Equality.\nWhy New York state differs\nNew York has exceeded the national average in pay equity since at least 1998, the earliest federal data available online. Some years are better than others. New York state was less than one percentage point above the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 national average in 2005, when women earned 81 percent as much as men in the U.S.\nOther states consistently rank near the bottom for pay equity.\nWhy? Experts say no single reason explains it.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Boysko\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in a committee debate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe United States is the only industrialized, modernized country that does not already have a paid family medical leave program in place.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOccupational segregation is one reason. The types of jobs women and men hold vary by state, Raghu said. North Dakota, where high-earning men dominate the oil industry,\u00a0ranks low for pay equity.\nNew York state\u2019s higher minimum wage also makes a difference. The minimum wage in New York was $8.75 in 2015, above the federal minimum wage of $7.25. Having a higher pay floor reduces the gender wage gap for lower-income workers, experts say.\n\"In places like New York that have a higher minimum wage, you\u2019re going to see a smaller wage gap particularly at the lower end of the distribution,\" said Elise Gould, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute.\nUnion membership also has an effect, Gould said.\nNew York state ranks higher in union membership than any other state in the country with a 23.6 percent union membership rate. Wyoming, which has the widest gender wage gap in the country, has a 6.3 percent union membership rate.\n\"Your unions may be very strong in New York, including teachers unions and unions that support service workers,\" said Isabel Sawhill, a senior fellow in Economic Studies at the Brookings Institution.\nNew York City also drives up the state\u2019s pay equity ranking. Data from the American Association of University Women breaks down the wage gap by congressional district in New York state. Most districts in New York City rank above those upstate.\n\"I think the rural urban divide is definitely part of the story,\" said Kevin Miller, a senior researcher at AAUW. \"Cities tend to have smaller gaps, which is why we see the District of Columbia having a small gap.\"\nEducation is part of that. More women in New York state hold a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher, according to census data.\n\"The educational advantage is increasingly shifting toward women away from men, and in a technologically advancing economy that\u2019s going to favor toward women and raise their relative earnings,\" Sawhill said.\nThe family choices some women make during their careers also explain the wage gap.\nWomen are more likely to take time off work to care for a newborn child or a sick relative. A woman in that scenario may miss a significant chunk in pay during their leave from work. Without supplemental income during that time away from work, women are more likely to report lower pay than their male colleagues, experts say.\nOur ruling\nHochul said the gender wage gap in New York state is \"90 cents to the dollar.\"\nHochul is close to what federal data and research groups report as the wage gap in New York state. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics says women in New York make close to 87 percent of what men make. Researchers say it is closer to 89 percent.\nHochul's numbers are slightly off. The data reveals a gender pay gap, but her point that New York state has a significantly smaller\u00a0gap compared with the national average is correct.
