Cindy O\u2019Laughlin says they haven\u2019t.\n\n\nO\u2019Laughlin (R-Shelbina) said in part of a since-deleted March 22 Facebook post: \"I see no time in the history of this country when perfectly healthy people have been basically confined to their homes or only able to do essential things as in Kansas City or St. Louis.\"\n\n\nO\u2019Laughlin\u2019s statement referred to stay-at-home orders announced March 21 in Kansas City and St. Louis city and county. At the time of O\u2019Laughlin\u2019s statement, the state of Missouri had not issued a stay-at-home order.\u00a0\n\n\nThe statewide order expires May 4 and will be replaced with a phase-in of businesses and activities.\u00a0\n\n\nHow does stay-at-home in 2020 compare historically? We went looking \u2014 and found holes in O\u2019Laughlin\u2019s assertion nationally and in the state.\n\n\nThe flu of 1918\n\n\nWhen we reached out to O\u2019Laughlin for context, she called the stay-at-home orders in St. Louis and Kansas City \"expanded quarantines\" and said she believes they are taking away Missouri residents\u2019 rights. The CDC says quarantines restrict movements of sick people.\n\n\nA\u00a0statewide stay-at-home order\u00a0says residents should \"avoid leaving their homes or other places of residence.\" The order has exceptions, including allowing people to get groceries, prescriptions or gas. People are encouraged to get fresh air and get outside but abide by social distancing guidelines.\n\n\nWere there similar restrictions placed on healthy people before COVID-19? One place to start looking is the 1918 flu pandemic. Restrictions then looked a whole lot like today.\n\n\nO\u2019Laughlin\u2019s claim encompassed \"the history of the country.\"\u00a0Our fact check on a statement by Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer\u00a0cited several studies of cities' responses to the Spanish flu in which most public places were closed.\u00a0\n\n\nWe couldn\u2019t find a specific \"stay-at-home\" order for the 1918 flu in St. Louis. Still, the city\u2019s health commissioner ordered that all public gatherings like sports events, schools and churches be canceled.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll non-essential businesses were closed. Only banks, newspapers, embalmers and coffin makers were allowed to be open.\u00a0\n\n\nWe looked at newspaper pages from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that were archived on\u00a0newspapers.com. Some of the headlines in the late fall of 1918 included:\n\n\n\n\n\"Influenza Closing Order Extended to All Churches.\" On the same page, a sub-headline reads \"Playgrounds closed\" (Oct. 8).\n\n\n\"Governor Forbids All Public Gatherings in the State\" (Oct. 9) .\n\n\n\"No Public Funerals\" (Oct. 15).\n\n\n\n\nThe 2020 St. Louis citywide order said in part: \"This order allows residents to continue meeting their basic needs and that essential services are provided; however, residents will be required to stay at home when possible.\"\u00a0\n\n\nWhat about Kansas City?\n\n\nAccording to an\u00a0article\u00a0by KCUR, the city in 1918 never saw heavy restrictions because many people and businesses resisted. Schools were closed but were opened back up in October 1918.\n\n\nThe city\u2019s mortality rate from the the Spanish flu was higher than most cities in the country.\u00a0\n\n\nOur ruling\n\n\nO\u2019Laughlin said in a Facebook post: \"I see no time in the history of this country when perfectly healthy people have been basically confined to their homes or only able to do essential things as in Kansas City or St. Louis.\"\n\n\nMany cities during the Spanish flu outbreak enacted similar restrictions. And in Missouri, based on St. Louis\u2019 efforts to combat the 1918 flu pandemic, we can safely say that this \"time in history\" did occur. People were restricted on what they could do. Public gatherings were prohibited.\n\n\nClosed or canceled non-essential businesses, in-person churches and sports events also occurred then and now.\n\n\nWe rate O\u2019Laughlin\u2019s statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18238"}
