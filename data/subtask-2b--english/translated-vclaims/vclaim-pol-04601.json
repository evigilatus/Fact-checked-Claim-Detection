Speakers at the conference compared Clinton with her opponent Donald Trump, whose comments on women were widely noted. \"Her opponent said that a woman must be punished for exercising her right of choice and then chose a fellow candidate who believed that Roe v. Wade belonged, by quote, \"in the pile of ashes from history.\" \"California Sen, Barbara Boxer, speaking of Trump and his vice-president, choosing Indiana Goff.\" Mike Pines. It is difficult to stabilize Trump &apos; s abortion stance. Throughout the election cycle, he was opposed to abortion, with exceptions. But in previous years, he called himself \"very pro-choice.\" It is therefore easy for Trump's opponents to criticize his position. In the same vein, Boxer's claim that Trump said that women should be \"punished\" by abortion is a selective reading of Trump's comments, which have been transformed. Women should be punished for abortion, but he had returned to his comments on the same day. \"He said so, she heard it,\" said Puckser press secretary Peter Tru. What Trump Trump said about the comments made on March 30, 2016, was a conversation with Chris Matthews MSNBC. Here are two relevant parts of the conversation. (More reading here.) Matthews: \"No, should a woman be punished for abortion?\" That's not something you can avoid. TATHWS: \"If you say abortion is a crime or abortion is a crime of murder, you have to deal with it under the law. Should abortion be punished?\" Trump: \"Well, people in certain parts of the Republican Party and conservative Republicans say, \"Yes, they must be punished.\" Matthews: \"What about you?\" Truump: \"I'd like to say it's a very serious problem. It's a problem we have to decide about. It's so hard.\" \"The distinguished fact-checkers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn\" will be appointed vice president. By Samantha Butterman: January 11, 2021 Matthews: \"Do you believe in punishment for abortion, yes or no as a principle?\" The answer is there must be some form of punishment. \"For the sake of the woman\" \"Yes, there must be some form.\" Ten cents? Ten years? What? \"I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.\" The idea is that Trump says he thinks there should be a \"form of punishment\" for a woman. But he quickly went back those comments. What Trump later said after shouting about his remarks the same day, the Trump campaign issued a statement stating that the person who performed the abortion would face consequences if Congress passed a law prohibiting the abortion. The statement read as follows: \"If Congress enacts legislation making abortion illegal and the federal courts have upheld this legislation, or any state is permitted to prohibit abortion under state and federal law, the doctor or any other person who does this illegal act against women shall be held legally responsible, not women. In this case, a woman is a victim as is life in her womb.\" In an interview with Fox News on March 31, Trump said that he could \"talk\" in his conversation with Matthews, adding that it was a \"complicated discussion.\" \"If, in fact, abortion is prohibited, the person performing the abortion, the doctor or whoever actually does the act is responsible, and not the woman responsible,\" said Trump. \"So, that's how I've always felt.\" As our friends in Snoops have noted, it is not like Trump he or he was a strong advocate for punishing women for abortion, which suddenly reversed his position. Trump was answering a hypothetical question posed by Matthews, which he first tried to avoid about laws prohibiting abortion that currently do not exist. He retracted the commentary shortly thereafter. Trump said that women should be punished for exercising their right to choose. Trump said something in this regard, but explained his comments within hours. Trump said that he intended to punish doctors for performing abortions, not women who undergo them. In our assessment of this claim, Trump's comments are contradictory. Yes, mention punishment, but his campaign retracted that statement. There is no evidence that this position has long existed. The Boxer statement is partially accurate but ignores important details, so we evaluate it half right. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6e3732c3-0674-40c9-b479-b615b7a35c81", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04601"}
