Carol Chea Porter and her rival at the Democratic Party, the former Republic of Frank Guinta. Here's the narrative of the announcement, paid for by the National Commission of the Republican Congress, the electoral arm of the Republican House of Representatives: \"Carol She Porter votes with Democrats in Nancy Belusi 95% of the time. More spending, higher taxes. We need to change. As mayor, Frank Ginta brought a tax cap on Manchester and balanced four straight budgets. Frank will take care of both sides. Reducing spending, fighting for a balanced budget, and restoring medical care to protect our elderly. \"New Hampshire Autonomous Values, this is Frank Genta.\" But is the comparison in party voting patterns really that stark? The answer is no. It is easy to compare their records, because Shi Porter and Gonta exchanged ownership of the seat during several previous electoral cycles. She Porter was elected a member of the House of Representatives in 2006 and 2008, then lost in Genta in 2010, then beaten in a second match in 2012. The footnotes to the announcements refer to Shi Porter's party voting record of 95% in a Washington Post voting study. This shows that Shea Porter has already voted with her party 95% of the time in the current Congress. A similar study conducted quarterly in Congress shows that Shi Porter &apos; s party unity varies from 95 per cent to 98 per cent each year during her professional life in Congress. So the announcement has the point that Shi Porter has faithfully voted the party line at home. The problem with the Declaration is to suggest that Gwenta did the opposite. He didn't. On 19 September 2012, Anne McLane Custer stated in a press release on 19 September 2012 that he said, \"Rep. Charlie Bass, R-NH's voice for \"upping his own salary\" eight times by Mariles Jill\" (September 28, 2012), the same postage record shows that in Genta state in Congress -- 2011 and 2012 coverage -- he voted with his party 96 percent of the time. This hardly distinguishes from the way Shea Porter voted with her party. The CQ account shows the same result: Gwenta achieved 97 per cent in party unity in 2011 and 95 per cent in 2012. The spokesman for the Norwegian Refugee Council, Ian Breyer, responded with two arguments. First, he said that if Gwenta had worked as mayor of Manchester with my 100 percent right-wing party positions, he wouldn't be able to implement a tax ceiling (or balance four budgets of a straight city). Second, he said that Shee Porter's voices, which constituted 95 percent \"out of contact with her region and turned out to be putting her own liberal agenda ahead of her region. Both points have advantages, but they are far from being bulletproof. In the first point of the Prime Minister, city-level policymaking tends to be more technocratic and less shaped by the national political party leading Congress. In the exact comparison of candidates -- how they voted in Congress -- they both voted in a virtual party lock. At his second point, She Porter's voices outside the province, we will only note that the province voted for Obama for the presidency not once but twice. It is possible that since his re-election in 2012, voters have become disgusted on his agenda. We'll soon find out: that's the purpose of the election. Our verdict in the NRC's announcement is that She Porter \"votes with Democrats Nancy Belusi 95% of the time,\" but Guinta \"will take both parties\" and has \"autonomous New Hampshire values.\" This is a very stark comparison -- however, by measuring the apples to a single dish of how the two candidates voted in Congress, Gwenta recorded a 96% party unit with the Republicans during his term in Congress, which is hardly evidence of a major contradiction. We assess the claim mostly wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07084"}
