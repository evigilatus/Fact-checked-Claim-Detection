As the mob could be heard shouting outside the doors of the Senate, police escorted first Vice President Mike Pence and then senators out of the chamber. The intruders took turns posing for photographs at the dais.\u00a0\nBut online, another narrative is unfolding as some deny what happened and instead push \"false flag\" claims. (False flags are supposed covert operations designed to deflect blame. They are frequently the subject of conspiracy theories.)\n\"The moment we realized this is a staged psyop,\" someone tweeted, sharing a video of a Capitol police officer retreating as a mob of people walks toward him.\u00a0\nOther social media users have shared an image of a man behind the dais in the Senate chamber with his arm raised. Standing above him in the gallery, a photographer is pointing his camera down.\u00a0\nThe photographer is circled and a red arrow is drawn pointing to another red circle around the man at the dais.\u00a0\n\"This look staged to you?\" reads the text over the image. \"Fist in the air classic Trump supporter signal, right?\"\u00a0\nBut text elsewhere on the photo seems to refute that illusion: \"NOT MAGA,\" it says.\n\"I have friends in DC now and they are saying don\u2019t believe the media,\" said one Instagram post that shared the image. \"Antifa is who stormed the capital through the back. Protesters are in the front praying and singing. They are looking to divide us even more. They are also blocking live streams from real people. Why on earth would they do that? They don\u2019t want you to see what\u2019s really going on.\"\u00a0\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.
