The proposed changes to the House of Representatives Bill 194 include allowing voters to change their address on the Internet, requiring persons making temporary votes to present additional forms of identity, removing the requirement that polling personnel in the wrong constituency direct voters to the right constituency, and preventing electoral councils from mailing absent ballots to voters. Among the controversial changes is the imposition of new restrictions on early voting, which Democrats say is the repression of voters. The Republicans say that the state needs more uniform voting systems and less expensive methods to manage elections. Under the bill, the vote by post is reduced to 21 days before the elections, from 35 days now. The personal vote will be limited to 10 days prior to the elections. This last point was one of many of the leader of the Democratic House Armond Podich of Pitchwood, who was against in a news release on 18 May, the day the bill was passed along the party lines. \"changes in the House of Representatives Bill 194 that make it more difficult to participate in Ohio elections include a reduction in early personal voting from 35 days to 6 days,\" he said: Polyte Fact Ohio wondered how Podish had come six days, since the bill said ten days. Specifically, the 194th House of Representatives Bill states: \"For all voters who apply to vote in the absence of voting in person, the ballot papers shall be printed and ready for use from the tenth day before the election day.\" So how does a podish come in six days? His Chief of Staff, Kiari McCarthy, said, pay close attention to the language of the bill. The bill goes on to state that personal voting is prohibited on Sundays and must end on Friday before election day. In applying these restrictions over the 10-day period, four days are prohibited for voters: first Sunday and last Sunday in the period, and Saturday and the two days immediately preceding election day. The Ohio Senate, which is also controlled by the Republicans, has passed Bill 148 of the Senate, which also makes significant changes to electoral laws and processes. It reflects the House of Representatives Bill in many ways but presents some differences, which will be resolved in the coming days between Republican leaders representing both houses. One of the differences between the two bills relates to personal voting. The Senate version calls for a personal vote to begin 16 days before election day. However, this window is also restricted by the ban on voting on Sundays, Saturdays and Mondays before election day. It also requires electoral councils to close the voting on Saturday afternoon. The copy of the Council shall be permitted to vote until 6 p.m. In application of these restrictions, the Senate Bill takes five days and leaves 11 days for personal vote. By going back to the House Bill and evaluating Podish, his statement is accurate and little is lacking. On truth or meter, politics in Ohio appreciates his claim to be \"right.\" He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. \u2022 January 12, 2012", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-13033"}
