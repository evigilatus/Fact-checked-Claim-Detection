(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe original photo appears to be an image used by some news organizations reporting on the executive orders Biden signed on his first day in office.\u00a0\nIn this version of the photo, Biden\u2019s hands appear on the desk as they do in the image being shared on social media. There is also a stack of executive orders sitting next to him and he\u2019s wearing the same blue suit and tie. Only in the original, he\u2019s also wearing a black face mask and looking up, eyes open.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo footage from that day shows the president wearing a mask, signing orders and speaking to the reporters as cameras can be heard clicking in the background.\u00a0\nWe found nothing to support the allegation that he was caught and photographed sleeping at his desk.\u00a0\nThe public schedule the Biden transition team released for Jan. 20, the day that picture was taken, began with an 8:45 a.m. church service and ended with a 9:55 p.m. appearance by Biden and the first lady on the Blue Room Balcony.\nThe president\u2019s public schedule\u00a0is available online.
