Jody Hice, R-Ga., tweeted on Nov. 12. \"If they truly wanted unity, they wouldn\u2019t have spent 4 years refusing to acknowledge Trump\u2019s 2016 victory.\"\u00a0\nThe claim has since gone viral as a Facebook post that was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nIn fact, Democrats began acknowledging Trump\u2019s electoral-vote victory in 2016 within hours after it became clear. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, who won the popular vote, called Trump on election night to congratulate him and offered to work with him. She also urged her supporters to accept the results and \"look to the future.\"\n\"Donald Trump is going to be our president,\" Clinton said during her concession speech the morning of Nov. 9. \"We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead. Our constitutional democracy enshrines the peaceful transfer of power. And we don\u2019t just respect that, we cherish it.\"\u00a0\nThe Democratic National Committee\u2019s interim chair, Donna Brazile, referred to Trump as the president-elect in a Nov. 9 statement and congratulated him on his win.\u00a0\nTwo days after the election, President Barack Obama invited Trump to the White House, where they posed together and shook hands after a cordial meeting. Trump afterward called Obama \"a good man\" and said he\u2019d seek his counsel.\u00a0\n\"We are all now rooting for his success,\" Obama said that day. \"The peaceful transfer of power is one of the hallmarks of our democracy. And over the next few months, we are going to show that to the world.\"\nObama also issued a Nov. 10 statement about a smooth transition of power and what that would look like. The federal government began to engage with Trump\u2019s transition team that same week.\nThe list of Democratic leaders who promptly acknowledged his victory goes on: Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, then-House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, and Secretary of State John Kerry, who was the party\u2019s 2004 presidential nominee, all congratulated Trump and referred to him as the president-elect.\nThere were some dissidents. Some House Democrats tried to challenge Trump\u2019s Electoral College win when Congress validated the results Jan. 6. Their efforts failed because no senator chose to join them.\u00a0\nSeveral Democrats boycotted Trump\u2019s inauguration, citing various reasons. One of them, Georgia Democratic Rep. John Lewis, said at the time that he didn\u2019t regard Trump as a legitimate president-elect, citing intelligence reports that Russia played a role in supporting his candidacy and undermining Clinton. The two continued to feud until Lewis\u2019 death in July 2020.\nWe reached out to Hice\u2019s office to find the out the basis for his claim. His office didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL. Lin Wood\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in an interview with the Patriotically Correct Radio Show\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"China was behind the interference and the effort to overthrow our government and the election, election fraud.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Daniel Funke \u2022 January 19, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018Not my president\u2019\u00a0\nDespite top Democratic leaders\u2019 calls to accept the results, protests broke out in the days that followed the election and on Inauguration Day. Thousands across the country gathered with chants of \"Not my president\" and, \"We reject the president-elect.\" Clinton supporters also took to social media with the hashtags #NotMyPresident and #ImStillWithHer.\u00a0\nThe protesters criticized Trump\u2019s rhetoric and policies on immigration, and thousands expressed grief and anger over his win. The message was that Trump didn\u2019t represent their values, not that he hadn\u2019t won the election.\u00a0\nOthers responded to the results with calls for election reform. Some progressive groups brought attention to the Electoral College system for allowing presidential candidates to win without the national popular vote, and blamed his win partly on voter suppression. While Trump won states accounting for 306 electoral votes, well over the 270 he needed to win, about 2.9 million more people voted for Clinton.\nRussia\nTrump has repeatedly accused Democrats of undercutting his 2016 victory with claims of Russian interference in the election, which he has dismissed as a \"hoax.\"\u00a0\nBut Democrats weren\u2019t the only ones to point to Russian interference in 2016. Intelligence agencies, law enforcement and an independent special counsel all concluded that Russia meddled in the 2016 election to favor Trump. A bipartisan Senate panel in April 2020 backed those findings.\nSpecial Counsel Robert Mueller, a former FBI director who conducted a two-year probe into Russia\u2019s interference, concluded that the Trump campaign and Russian officials were in contact several times, and that the Trump campaign believed it would benefit from Moscow\u2019s interference. Mueller\u2019s investigation did not establish whether those contacts amounted to a criminal conspiracy or illegal coordination.\nIt\u2019s unclear how much influence Russia had on the election outcome.\u00a0\nImpeachment\nTrump and his supporters also point to his 2019 impeachment as evidence of a Democratic effort to erase his election victory.\nIn December 2019, after investigating a whistleblower complaint about a Trump phone call, the Democratic-controlled House impeached Trump on two counts. The first was abuse of power for allegedly strong-arming Ukraine to investigate his political opponent, Joe Biden, and undermining national security. The other article accused Trump of blocking cooperation with Congress over its impeachment inquiry.\u00a0\nThe impeachment of Trump, as with President Bill Clinton in 1998, was a constitutional response to alleged misconduct in office, not a refusal to acknowledge his victory. The Senate acquitted Trump.\nOur ruling\nHice claimed that Democrats have spent four years refusing to acknowledge Trump\u2019s 2016 victory.\nWhile there were some dissident voices that questioned the legitimacy of Trump\u2019s election, top Democrats acknowledged Trump\u2019s win and referred to him as the president-elect less than a day after election results became clear. Those leaders included Clinton, Obama, Democratic leaders in Congress and the DNC.\u00a0\nTrump and his supporters have claimed that the investigation into Russian involvement in the election and the 2019 impeachment represented Democrats\u2019 refusal to accept the 2016 election result. The conclusion that Russia interfered in the election was supported by law enforcement, intelligence agencies and a bipartisan Senate panel, not just Democrats. And the impeachment was a response to a whistleblower\u2019s complaint about alleged wrongdoing.\nHice goes too far in his claim\u00a0that Democrats spent four years refusing to acknowledge Trump's victory, and provides\u00a0no evidence for it.\nWe rate this claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18571"}
