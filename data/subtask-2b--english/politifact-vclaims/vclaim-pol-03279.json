And that has never been bounced against a state\u2019s voter rolls to say well, hey, how many of these people, with this name, this date of birth, so you can get an exact match. How many of them are registered to vote in state A or state B?\"\nKobach\u2019s comments struck us as misleading, because of the widespread publicity about the problems Florida faced when attempting to use federal data to search for noncitizen voters.\nThe only DHS data we know of that includes these legal immigrants is Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE. SAVE has been used in a handful for states precisely for the purpose of weeding out ineligible voters. But when it was tried in Florida under Republican Gov. Rick Scott, it created so many problems that it was scrapped in 2012.\nKobach didn\u2019t refer to SAVE by name on Fox News, and his spokeswoman didn\u2019t directly answer our question as to whether that was the data he was meant. But there\u2019s no other database of legal immigrants that we know of that could be compared to voter rolls. \u00a0\nImplemented in 1987, SAVE provides government officials access to various databases, usually so various agencies can verify the citizenship status of an individual to determine eligibility for benefits such as Medicaid or Social Security. (This is not a database of illegal immigrants, such a full list doesn\u2019t exist.)\nSAVE has access to records on noncitizens who have been processed by federal agencies. For that reason, SAVE later became used by a few states for voter registration purposes.\nWhich places use SAVE?\nElection officials in Florida, Colorado, Georgia, North Carolina and Virginia and several Arizona counties have reached agreements with DHS to use SAVE, but they aren\u2019t necessarily active users. In fiscal year 2016, less than 1 percent of 20 million SAVE queries were for voter registration (or about 920).\nFlorida\u2019s 2012 attempt shows why a state might decide to change course.\nFlorida election officials briefly used SAVE as part of a voter-purge effort. But doing so led to many errors, including wrongly identifying some citizens as noncitizens including four Polk County residents born in Puerto Rico, which automatically qualifies them for U.S. citizenship. \u00a0Yeral Arroliga, an immigrant from Nicaragua, was flagged as a noncitizen despite telling the Miami Herald he provided proof of citizenship.\nState election officials ultimately scrapped using SAVE.\nState election officials in Georgia and Virginia also told PolitiFact that they no longer use the system.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColorado and North Carolina, however, still do.\nFederal warnings said SAVE isn\u2019t foolproof\nThe Homeland Security Department under both George W. Bush and Barack Obama has cautioned states about relying too much on the system for voter registration purposes.\nSome state election officials including Kobach\u2019s spokeswoman, Samantha Poetter, has said SAVE isn\u2019t useful for voter registration purposes because the federal government puts too many restrictions on its use.\nFor state election officials to use SAVE, they need a person\u2019s alien registration number or a naturalization certificate or certificate of citizenship -- information that election officials don\u2019t typically have.\n\"SAVE access has not been granted in a meaningful way to any state,\" Kobach\u2019s spokeswoman Samantha Poetter said. \"The state must already possess an alien number assigned by the federal government.\"\nWhile some states have said SAVE isn\u2019t useful to them, others have found workarounds.\nColorado and North Carolina election officials told PolitiFact that they obtain information from drivers license records. A driver\u2019s license shows that applicants are not citizens and then check to see if they registered to vote. If they obtain a match, then they run the person through SAVE. A match isn\u2019t definitive -- because the information may be out of date. That\u2019s why even a match in SAVE requires additional steps to determine if someone is not a citizen and therefore ineligible to vote.\nNorth Carolina\u2019s post-2016 election audit showed that 41 noncitizens with legal status, such as a green card, cast ballots. The audit identified an additional 34 voters who provided documents showing they are U.S. citizens, and investigators continue to review 61 additional records. That\u2019s out of a total of nearly 4.8 million voters who participated in the November election.\nVirginia election officials found SAVE wasn\u2019t useful because the state doesn\u2019t have the alien numbers.\nHowever, Virginia uses another method: the names of those who check a box on a driver\u2019s license form indicating they are not citizens is run against the voter registration list. \u00a0If that produces a match, it is forwarded to a local registrar who sends letters to the voters.\nThe current system works, Virginia's top elections official\u00a0Edgardo Cort\u00e9s said.\n\"Overall the processes states have in place -- the checks we have in the system with all the data sharing going on \u00a0-- we are able to identify folks who at some point are not supposed to be on the list and get them off,\" \u00a0Cort\u00e9s said.\nOur ruling\nKobach says the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s database of legal immigrants has \"never\" been \"bounced against a state\u2019s voter rolls.\"\nThere is a kernel of truth here, in that there has not been a widespread comparison of federal government data on immigrants and voter rolls in all the states to search for noncitizen voters.\nHowever, Kobach misleads when he said that it has never been tried. A handful of states have used federal information about immigrants in SAVE to check voter eligibility. Some of them encountered issues with the system and have chosen not to keep using it.\nWe rate this claim Mostly False.\n Share the Facts 2017-05-23 21:07:18 UTC   PolitiFact    4 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly False  The Department of Homeland Security\u2019s database of legal immigrants has \"never\" been \"bounced against a state\u2019s voter rolls.\"    Kris Kobach Kansas Secretary of State    Sunday, May 14, 2017 2017-05-14    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03279"}
