Both bills were vetoed by the state\u2019s Democratic governor. But had they passed, they would have substantially altered Montana\u2019s land use law.\nOne bill \u2014 the more sweeping of the two measures we looked at \u2014 was a 2011 proposal to reduce the influence local governments have on whether a proposed subdivision can move forward. Specifically, the bill \u2014 HB 542 \u2014 would have narrowed the range of factors planners could consider while assessing a subdivision\u2019s agricultural impact.\nThe proposal would also have imposed a requirement that planners back up their arguments with peer-reviewed studies, and it set a strict deadline on the amount of time the government had to deliver its findings.\nAnd under the bill, if a court ruled in a developer\u2019s favor, the losing party would have to pay attorney\u2019s fees \u2014 a provision that experts said was meant to discourage legal challenges to subdivision proposals and environmental permitting decisions.\nRosendale voted in favor of both the House bill in 2011, as well as a similar Senate bill in 2013.\nHis campaign did not dispute Tester\u2019s characterization of the bills as pro-developer. In fact, every source we consulted unanimously agreed with that conclusion. \u00a0\u00a0\n\"This bill was an attempt by developers to make it easier to subdivide suburban property for housing development,\" Mike Dennison, chief political reporter for Montana Television Network who covered the HB 542 debate in 2011, told us.\nBecause the pro-developer portion of the claim is not disputed, we\u2019re concerned here with only one question: Did the measures that Rosendale supported stand to hurt Montana farmers?\nThe answer is a mixed picture.\nSome farmers hurt\nOpponents\u2019 main argument against changing the law was that it would lead to the disappearance of Montana farmland.\nAs evidence, Tester\u2019s campaign pointed us to a 2011 op-ed in The Missoulian that carried the headline, \"Subdivision bill bad for farmers, ranchers.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn it, Stephanie Laporte, a member of the Community Food and Agriculture Coalition, argued the proposed changes would gut the law\u2019s original intent of protecting Montana farmland, by \"allow(ing) subdivisions to run wild through farming and ranching communities.\"\n\"Make no mistake,\" Laporte wrote, \"if approved by the Senate, HB 542 will hurt farmers and ranchers, lead to the permanent loss of agricultural land, and jeopardize Montana's top industry for decades to come.\"\nDennison, who covered the legislative debate for the Billings Gazette, said some farmers may have viewed the prospect of rolling back agricultural protections as a kind of slippery slope.\n\"It\u2019s possible that farmers who don\u2019t want to subdivide their land may feel squeezed by other landowners doing it and feel powerless to stop encroaching development,\" Dennison told us. \"They may have seen this bill as making it harder (for local government) to slow things.\"\nDespite these concerns, the House bill (and a similar 2013 Senate bill) cleared both legislative chambers before dying on the desk of a Democratic governor.\n\"I issue this veto because the amendments to Montana\u2019s subdivision review process contained in HB 542 are unnecessary, contrary to the public interest, and could jeopardize one of Montana\u2019s most important industries \u2013 farming and ranching,\" Gov. Brian Schweitzer said in an April 2011 veto message.\nOther farmers helped\nOn the other hand, some farmers welcomed the bill. To its supporters, the changes represented a regulatory rollback that would broaden farmers\u2019 rights to do as they wish with their private property.\n\"Farming and agricultural interests in Montana, on land-use policy, tend to default toward less regulation,\" Dennison told us. \"They see regulation and planning as possible encroachment on private-property rights, which they are very enthusiastic about.\"\nRather than a government planner blocking the subdivision of farmland, property owners always have another option, Dennison noted: \"If farmers don\u2019t want development, they don\u2019t have to subdivide their land.\"\nBased on an analysis the voting breakdown of the 2011 House bill, Dennison reasoned that while some farm interests opposed the bill, most of the mainstream agricultural groups likely either supported or didn\u2019t oppose it because of the property-rights issue.\nChuck Johnson, a veteran Montana political and state government reporter for the Last Best News and Missoula Current, also said the bill presented a mixed picture in terms of its effect on Montana farmers.\n\"It would have hurt some farmers,\" he told us. \"But it would have benefited those farmers \u2014 probably in the small minority \u2014 who wanted to subdivide their land or sell it to someone who wanted to subdivide.\"\nA spokesman for Rosendale cited the case of a Montanan named George Lake who saw\u00a0the measure as a way to\u00a0broaden his property rights. In testimony before his local government committee, Lake said he spent three years appealing to local planners to approve the subdivision of his relatively modest plot, before ultimately giving up.\n\"The unpredictable and inconsistent approval process is a huge issue for small-time property owners like (Lake) who don\u2019t have the clout that a major developer does,\" said Shane Scanlon, communications director for Matt Rosendale.\nFarming groups divided\nFarm groups were divided on the subdivision law changes Rosendale backed, which would seem to underscore the farming community\u2019s mixed feelings.\nThe Montana Farmers Union, which tends to align with Democrats and has traditionally represented relatively smaller farmers, opposed the 2013 Senate measure, calling it \"an anti-agriculture bill.\" (The Montana Farmers Union did not respond to a request for comment.)\nBut the Montana Farm Bureau Federation, which typically lines up with Republican positions and tends to support relatively larger farmers, backed the measure.\n\"It was helpful to developers but not particularly harmful to agriculture,\" John Youngberg, executive vice president of the Montana Farm Bureau Federation, told us.\nJohnson, the veteran Montana politics reporter who explained the farm groups\u2019 political leanings to us, said that despite the groups\u2019 partisan tendencies, they don\u2019t always line up on opposite sides of the aisle.\n\"At times, the various farming and ranching groups work together on issues, and are quite formidable,\" he said. \"This issue was one where they disagreed.\"\nOur ruling\nTester said, \"Matt Rosendale consistently supported land use rules that would help developers like him and hurt farmers in Montana.\"\nFor this fact-check, we looked at two measures that would have relaxed Montana\u2019s land use rules. Sources we consulted unanimously characterized these bills as pro-developer.\nThe question of how farmers would fare under the proposed changes, however, yielded a much more mixed answer. Some farmers appeared fearful that laxer regulation would lead to the disappearance of Montana farmland. Yet others welcomed the broader private-property rights engendered in the new laws.\nFarm groups were divided on the subdivision law changes Rosendale backed, which underscores the farming community\u2019s mixed feelings.\nWe rate this Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01750"}
