The database also calls the \"north, east, west, south\" theory \"absurd folk-etymology:\"\n\"Late 14c., \u2018new things,\u2019 plural of new (n.) \u2018new thing\u2019 (see new (adj.)); after French nouvelles, which was used in Bible translations to render Medieval Latin nova (neuter plural) \u2018news,\u2019 literally \u2018new things.\u2019\nThe English word was construed as singular at least from the 1560s, but it sometimes still regarded as plural 17c.-19c. The odd and doubtful construction probably accounts for the absurd folk-etymology (attested by 1640 but originally, and in 18c. usually, in jest-books) that claims it to be an abbreviation of north east south west, as though \u2018information from all quarters of the compass.\u2019\"\nThe word paper alone has origins in the Latin word \"papyrus,\" the stalks used to make paper, and the Greek word \"papyros.\"\u00a0\nThis claim is a repurposed hoax.
