We will look at three assertions made by Democratic Rep. Bill Pascrell of New Jersey. In this item, we will test his assertion that 45 percent of Americans went without needed care because of costs.\n\n\nOn July 28, 2009, Pascrell took to the House floor to counter assertions by Republicans and others that a Democratic bill under consideration in the chamber would lead to the rationing of health care. Pascrell\u2019s larger point was that rationing already exists today, just a different type \u2014 thanks to the financial barriers to coverage faced by millions of Americans.\n\n\nSpecifically, Pascrell said: \u201cForty-five percent of Americans went without needed care because of costs in this country in 2007. That\u2019s rationing. Fifty-three percent of Americans cut back on their health care in the last year because of costs. That\u2019s rationing. \u2026 As many as 22,000 Americans die each year because they don\u2019t have health insurance. My brothers and sisters, that\u2019s rationing.\u201d\n\n\nWe are not going to weigh in on the question of whether it\u2019s fair to equate Pascrell\u2019s examples of \u201crationing\u201d with what the bill\u2019s critics charge the bill would do if enacted. Rather, we wanted to gauge whether Pascrell\u2019s numbers were sound. So we looked at these three claims individually.\n\n\nThe first claim comes from a biennial survey by the Commonwealth Fund, a widely respected nonprofit that studies health care policy. The survey sampled the views of 3,501 U.S. adults age 19 and older, between June 6 and October 24, 2007.\n\n\nThe 2007 version of Commonwealth\u2019s survey did indeed find that 45 percent of adults aged 19 to 64 had one of four \u201caccess problems\u201d related to cost \u2014 not filling a prescription; not seeing a specialist when needed; skipping a recommended medical test, treatment or followup; or not visiting a doctor or a clinic when they had a medical problem. That rate is notably higher than the 29 percent who reported similar actions in the 2001 survey.\n\n\nSurveys, especially where participants need to recall for survey-takers what they did or didn\u2019t do in the past, are always somewhat less reliable than research methodology that checks verifiable facts. \u201cAs a survey it\u2019s reasonable, but surveys are inherently imperfect yardsticks for this kind of policy research,\u201d said Ed Haislmaier, a scholar at the conservative Heritage Foundation.\n\n\nMoreover, the numbers are now two years out of date. (The next Commonwealth survey is scheduled for release later this year.) And it\u2019s obvious, but worth noting, that individually, the rates for each of those four actions was quite a bit lower than 45 percent: 31 percent of respondents didn\u2019t fill a prescription, 31 percent didn\u2019t go to a doctor or clinic for a medical problem, 25 percent skipped a test, treatment or followup, and 20 percent didn\u2019t see a specialist.\n\n\nStill, we do not believe these problems detract in any serious way from the congressman\u2019s claim, but they are worth noting. These are the most recent numbers available from Commonwealth \u2014 and it\u2019s hard to imagine that the rates of access problems would have dropped precipitously since the 2007 poll was taken. Back then, the national unemployment rate was averaging 4.7 percent. Today, it\u2019s almost twice that.\n\n\nWe rate this claim by Pascrell to be Mostly True.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.
