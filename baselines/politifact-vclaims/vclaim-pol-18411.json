Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., one of the Green New Deal sponsors, included language and policies not found in the resolution. The original version of the FAQ, which was quickly retracted, included a goal that continues to attract attention: \"Upgrade or replace every building in U.S. for state-of-art energy efficiency\" over a 10-year-period.\u00a0\u00a0\nClose to two years later, social media users continue to refer to that now-retracted sentence about replacing buildings. One Instagram post says, \"The Green New Deal would require that 99% of homes in the country be torn down and rebuilt more \u2018energy efficient\u2019 over a ten year period.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

The plan would be for the federal government to provide incentives for homeowners to make those improvements.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry\n\n\nstated on January 31, 2021 in in an interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays that Hurricane Harvey \u201cdropped more water on Houston in five days than goes over Niagara Falls in a year.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brandon Mulder \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe think tank that is helping to develop the Green New Deal acknowledges that making those types of changes to some homes, particularly older ones, could expose bigger structural or safety problems, according to Fast Company.
