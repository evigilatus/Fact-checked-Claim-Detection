But did it really happen?\nThe article is a\u00a0pitch-black void of evidence to suggest that Diesel died. This story was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nFiguring out the facts of this story was less complicated than the plot of XXX.\nFor starters, Diesel\u2019s name is spelled incorrectly in the headline.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s also notable that there\u2019s no byline for the article. Reputable news stories usually come with a byline to keep writers accountable and allow readers to contact the author if necessary.\nBelow the headline, there are two paragraphs lifted, word-for-word, from Vin Diesel\u2019s Wikipedia page.\u00a0\nThe page also contains a video clip featuring a Fox News logo and a newscaster. Clicking on it, you\u2019d expect to hear a news anchor reporting on the news of Vin Diesel\u2019s death. \u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut if you click on the video, you\u2019ll actually hear the anchor say, \"Finally, I have some very sad news,\" before the clip freezes and is replaced by the words \"Share to Uncover This Video.\"\nClicking on those words opens up a pop-up window that allows you to share a link to the article on Facebook.\nWe found after we shared the story, the video still would not load.\nA Nexis search revealed that no major news outlets have reported on Diesel\u2019s death, and no obituaries have been written for him.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that incorrect rumors of Diesel\u2019s death have spread like the Necromongers across the galaxy. The hoax occurred at least one other time, in 2014.\nWe were unable to get in touch with the website where the article was posted, as we could not find any contact information for them.\nOur ruling\nA story on a website, thth.mayatmenen.info, claims that actor Vin Diesel died \"after a failed attempt to perfect a stunt on set.\"\nThe article provides no evidence to support this claim, and no major news outlets are reporting that Diesel died.\nThis is an iron giant of a hoax.
