Zandi is a well-respected economist, one PolitiFact has quoted as an expert in previous fact checks.\nInterestingly, both Clinton and Trump claim Zandi is on the other team. Perhaps that\u2019s because politicians and economists on both sides of the aisle like Zandi, and because he has contributed to Democrats (including Clinton) and Republicans.\nZandi has said he is a registered Democrat, but he told us the only time he officially worked for a candidate was when he was an economic adviser to U.S. Sen. John McCain during the Arizona Republican\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign.\nZandi\u2019s two analyses project how Clinton\u2019s and Trump\u2019s policies would affect jobs nationwide during a first term: A gain of 10.4 million jobs under Clinton, a loss of nearly 3.5 million jobs under Trump.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin LeMahieu\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a TV interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It takes quite a while on Election Day to load those ballots, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe estimates gained headlines from the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times and CNN/Money. Critics said, among other things, that Zandi underestimates the value of tax cuts.\nBut, back to the claim about Wisconsin jobs. \u00a0\nClinton\u2019s campaign told us it arrived at the Wisconsin figures cited in the tweet by distributing Zandi\u2019s estimated total gains and losses among states in proportion to their population.\nOne can\u2019t assume that Clinton\u2019s or Trump\u2019s policies would have such an evenly-distributed impact on each state; indeed, for years, Wisconsin\u2019s job growth has lagged the nation\u2019s.\nBut Zandi and economist Alan Cole\u00a0of the free market-oriented Tax Foundation, which PolitiFact also quotes often, told us the extrapolation is reasonable. Zandi added that if he did a state-by-state breakdown, he would expect the numbers for Wisconsin to be roughly what Clinton stated.\nTo counter Clinton\u2019s claim, Trump\u2019s campaign pointed us to the Tax Foundation\u2019s January 2016 analysis of Clinton\u2019s tax plans, which projects that nationally there would be 311,000 fewer jobs over 10 years than would be expected under current law. Meanwhile, the foundation in a September 2015 analysis of Trump\u2019s tax plans projected 5.3 million more jobs over the same period.\nCole agreed with Zandi that Zandi\u2019s analyses considered more factors -- for example, spending as well as taxes -- than the Tax Foundation did. Cox also called Zandi\u2019s analyses an honest and serious effort, but said the Tax Foundation arrived at different conclusions because it took a different approach.\nIt\u2019s also important to note that both candidates have announced new proposals since the various estimates were made, though Zandi said he doesn\u2019t believe they would change his estimates significantly.\nOur rating\nClinton says she \"would bring 186,740 new jobs to Wisconsin\" and \"Donald Trump would cost Wisconsin 61,050 jobs.\"\nThe numbers are derived from analyses of Clinton and Trump policy proposals done by a respected economist from Moody Analytics who has supported both Democrats and Republicans.\nBut the numbers are estimates, not certainties. Moreover, estimates done by the Tax Foundation using a different methodology project job gains under Trump but job losses under Clinton.\nFor a statement that is partially accurate but needs additional information, our rating is Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04314"}
