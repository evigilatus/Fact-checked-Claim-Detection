And it has the highest graduation rate for African Americans and Hispanics.\"", "truth_label": "mostly-true", "date": "stated on June 4, 2015 in his declaration for president:", "title": "Rick Perry says Texas has second-best high school graduation rate, No. 1 rate for minorities", "text": "America, Rick Perry trumpeted, be like Texas.\nDeclaring his candidacy for president, the former 10-year governor saluted job gains on his watch, then turned to public education. \"Texas now has the second-highest high school graduation rate in the country,\" Perry said. \"And it has the highest graduation rate for African Americans and Hispanics.\"\nMost everyone likes rankings. We wondered about these because in February 2013, we rated Mostly True a Perry claim that the state\u2019s high school graduation rates were the nation\u2019s third-highest. In 2011, Texas tied with five states with the No. 3 graduation rate of 86 percent. Unsaid by Perry: Three states had higher rates. So Texas could best have been described as fourth-ranked. Also, by another gauge \u2014 comparing graduates to the number of students in ninth grade three years earlier \u2014 Texas remained among middling states for 2009-10, with a 79 percent completion rate.\nPerry\u2019s backup information\nTo our inquiry about Perry\u2019s latest claim, his campaign spokesman, Travis Considine, guided us to a U.S. Department of Education web page presenting graduation rates for the states, plus a chart showing such rates by race/ethnicity.\nBy email, Considine said that in 2012-13, the Texas high school graduation rate of 88 percent ranked second nationally. The same year, according to the federal information, Texas graduation rates for Hispanic and black students exceeded the rates in any other state.\nGovernment: Graduation rate placed Texas third for 2012-13\nWe took his cue, finding the government\u2019s January 2015 chart indicating the state\u2019s 2012-13 graduation rate of 88 percent tied Texas for second nationally with Nebraska, New Jersey, North Dakota and Wisconsin. Iowa led with a 90 percent rate.\nAccording to a note under the National Center for Education Statistics chart, the government\u2019s four-year \"adjusted cohort graduation rate\" was based on the \"number of students who graduate in four years with a regular high school diploma divided by the number of students who form the adjusted cohort for the graduating class.\" That is, according to the note, the size of the potential graduating class was adjusted starting the first year of high school by adding students who \u00a0subsequently transferred in and subtracting students who transferred out, moved to another country or who died as reported by each state.\nOn this front, we also checked with the Texas Education Agency. Spokeswoman DeEtta Culbertson advised by email that a follow-up federal chart, dated February 2015, presented each state\u2019s graduation rate as a three-digit figure, including tenths of a percentage point.\nThis added detail resulted in Texas landing third nationally, still tied with Wisconsin. TEA said in a March 2015 press release: \"The Texas graduation rate hit 88.0 percent for the second consecutive year, tying Wisconsin for the nation\u2019s third highest. Only Iowa at 89.7 percent and Nebraska at 88.5 percent posted higher graduation rates for the Class of 2013.\" To see if there was another way to shake these figures, we rounded each of the rates in the chart to two digits. Nope: Texas still placed third, tied with Wisconsin, North Dakota and New Jersey.\nGovernment: Texas No. 1 in graduation of Hispanic, black students\nThe same chart bore out Perry\u2019s claim about Texas having the highest graduation rates for Hispanic and African American students. The 85.1 percent Texas Hispanic graduation rate in 2012-13 was higher than such rate for other states, edging the 82.5 percent rates for Hispanic students in Indiana and the 82 percent rate for such students in Arkansas. Likewise, according to the chart, Texas ranked No. 1 that year for its black graduation rate, 84.1 percent, besting No. 2 New Hampshire, which had an 82 percent rate, and North Dakota, with an 80 percent rate.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother gauge puts Texas in middle of pack\nFrom past fact checks, we recognize another method often used to gauge graduation successes. In this vein, we rated as True a 2010 claim by Democratic gubernatorial candidate Bill White that Texas then ranked 43rd nationally for its 61.3 percent graduation rate in 2008-09.\nThat conclusion was based on comparing the year\u2019s number of graduates to the number of ninth-graders four years earlier, an indicator often called \"attrition.\" The intent is to get a snapshot of how many students graduate in four years.\nIn 2011-12, the latest year of available data, Texas had an 82 percent \"averaged freshman graduation rate,\" according to a center chart, putting it in a tie with four states. Twenty-one states had better rates; Vermont and Nebraska ranked first with 93 percent rates.\nTo our inquiry, Julian Vasquez Heilig, a professor at California State University Sacramento who has been critical of how Texas achieves its reported graduation rates, urged us to put stock in the attrition indicator because, he said, it shows the substantial dropoffs in student enrollment between ninth grade and the end of 12th grade.\nThe latest Texas example: In 2010-11, according to the TEA, 390,665 students were in ninth grade. Three years later, the agency says, there were 308,851 12th-graders, a 21 percent difference. That same year, 2013-14, 303,109 students graduated, the agency says. That graduating class, by our calculation, was 78 percent the size of the ninth-grade class three years before.\nBy email, Heilig suggested such enrollment drop-offs suggest a soft spot in the calculation of the graduation rates that place Texas among the nation\u2019s best performers. He said that\u2019s probably because the rates are rooted in each school district reporting the progress of each student, making it at least possible for administrators to record dropouts as students who left for legitimate reasons \u2014 such as moving to another state. In May 2014, Heilig laid out his own look at how Texas schools apply student \"leaver\" codes here.\nA TEA spokeswoman expressed confidence in how Texas tracks students. Lauren Callahan said by email that if a district\u2019s reported reasons for students leaving school look suspicious, it can trigger a state review. \"Is some leaver information ultimately inaccurate?\" Callahan said. \"Yes, but it is usually not because someone is intentionally lying. People just change their minds. At the time a student withdrew from public school, the parent signed a document saying the child was being transferred to a private school, for example. Ultimately something happens and the child never enrolls anywhere.\"\nOur ruling\nPerry said: \"Texas now has the second-highest high school graduation rate in the country. And it has the highest graduation rate for African Americans and Hispanics.\"\nAlmost: In 2012-13, per federal statistics, Texas ranked No. 3 in overall graduation rates and No. 1 for its African American and Hispanic rates. Then again, comparing graduates to the number of ninth graders enrolled three years earlier, Texas in 2011-12 had an 82 percent \"averaged freshman graduation rate,\" tying with four states and trailing 21 states.\nWe grade this claim Mostly True.\n\nMOSTLY TRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06291"}
