(If she had, it's reasonable to conclude it would have hampered her fundraising, which netted $151,000 from the securities and investment sector in the past two years.)\n\n\nA more recent version, forwarded numerous times to PolitiFact from readers imploring us to check it out, shares the same thrust, though it is in a class by itself when it comes to misplaced capital letters.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Nancy Pelosi wants a Windfall Tax on Retirement Income,\" it says. \"Madam speaker [where's that shift key when you need it?] Nancy Pelosi wants to put a Windfall Tax on all stock market profits, including Retirement fund, 401K and Mutual Funds! Alas, it is true \u2014 all to help the 12 Million Illegal Immigrants and other unemployed Minorities!\"\n\n\n\"Send it on to your friends,\" the e-mail concludes. \"I just did!! This lady is out of her mind.\"\n\n\nPelosi's office is well-practiced at responding to inquiries about this hoax, and did so with a prepared letter from the speaker:\n\n\n\"Internet and e-mail rumors indicating that I support a windfall profits tax on earnings from the stock market are completely and utterly fabricated,\" Pelosi's letter says. \"In addition, my record on promoting retirement security and strengthening 401(k)'s and other savings incentives in the tax code contradict these rumors.\"\n\n\nThe Democratic presidential candidates kicked around the idea of a windfall tax on oil companies, and Democrats support the idea of raising the capital gains tax rate somewhat. But there simply is not a shred of proof in the public record that Pelosi has ever advocated anything even remotely like the windfall tax described in these e-mails.\n\n\nIn her letter she provided links to two other fact-checkers who have debunked these e-mails, Snopes.com and Truthorfiction.com. She might consider adding FactCheck.org \u2014 they took on this hoax on Jan. 14, 2009.\n\n\nAnd by all means, feel free to add us to the list. This chain e-mail, distinguished by its longevity and implausibility, is Pants on Fire wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-15830"}
