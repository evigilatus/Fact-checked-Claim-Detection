Noting that Texas is a growing state, Perry said: \"We\u2019ve got a lot going on. We\u2019re creating a huge amount of jobs. A hundred percent of all the jobs lost during the recession have been reclaimed in Texas, have been re-created if you will, while the nation is at about 36 percent.\"\n\nPeople are moving to Texas for those jobs, Perry said, which creates challenges for energy, for water and for education \u2014 issues that Perry said would top his legislative priorities.\n\nDuring Perry\u2019s two most recent campaigns \u2014 his 2010 re-election effort and his bid to be the 2012 Republican presidential nominee \u2014 he repeatedly touted job gains in Texas, often saying that the state\u2019s performance, compared to the rest of the nation, showed that Texas economic policies should serve as a model for the country.\n\nWe fact-checked a lot of Perry\u2019s job-related claims, in many cases finding them Half True because even when his cited statistics were accurate, his explicit or implied claim of credit was not supported. Job gains or losses in individual states are driven by many factors, with neither gains or losses fairly attributable to an individual officeholder.\n\nIn the WFAA-TV interview, though, Perry did not lay claim to credit for all the jobs regained in Texas. So we\u2019re focusing this fact-check on whether he accurately compared developments in Texas and the nation. That is, did Texas regain all jobs lost during the recession while the country recaptured just 36 percent?\n\nPerry\u2019s calculation holds, as we\u2019ll detail later in this look.\n\nBut we paused first at whether Texas\u2019 return to pre-downturn employment levels means everyone who lost a job has landed back on a payroll.\n\nNo, said Cheryl Abbot, an economist with the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics in Dallas. That\u2019s because even though Texas has about the same number of jobs as it did before the downturn, it also has more people and a larger labor force. \"Yes, we have regained all the job slots \u2026 that we had prior to the recession,\" Abbot said. \"But as to who is filling those slots, we have no information. It could be new residents or Texans who got a job who had been unemployed.\"\n\nJohn Heleman, the state\u2019s chief revenue estimator, touched on this issue during a Feb. 21, 2012, hearing of the Texas House Appropriations Committee after noting that Texas \"had regained all the jobs it lost during the recessionary period\" while the United States had regained 36 percent.\n\nStill, Heleman said, the Texas unemployment rate was not falling \"as fast as one would hope\" and later noted that Texas is a growing state. \"Our labor force has grown,\" Heleman said. \"And in the years of the recession, we added people to our labor force that are currently not yet finding jobs. So, actually regaining all those jobs is a very good thing and a very positive thing, but we still have some ways to go.\"\n\nRichard Fisher, head of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, made a similar point about the unemployment rate in a Feb. 15, 2012, speech praising the Texas economy and its jobs recovery.\n\nAccording to the Texas Workforce Commission, the state labor force was about 11.7 million in the summer of 2008, when the state\u2019s total number of jobs started to drop. By January 2012, the labor force, meaning the number of people employed or looking for work, had surpassed 12.5 million.\n\nWhen Heleman spoke to the committee, he noted that the national unemployment rate had dropped to 8.5 percent in December 2011 from its recent recession high of 10 percent while the Texas rate had fallen to 7.8 percent from a high of 8.5 percent. (The Bureau of Labor Statistics has since revised the monthly Texas unemployment rates, putting the more recent high at 8.2 percent in December 2010 and the December 2011 figure at 7.4 percent.)\n\nBefore the number of Texas jobs began to drop, the state\u2019s unemployment rate was below 5 percent.\n\nSo, population growth, perhaps helped along by the attractiveness of the Texas economy, helps explain that it\u2019s unlikely that every Texan who lost a job in the recession has gained a new one. It\u2019s true too, though, that Perry didn\u2019t directly say everyone is back on a payroll.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd what of the job figures behind Perry\u2019s comparison?\n\nUnlike previous job statements we\u2019ve checked in which Perry compared Texas\u2019 performance to that of the 49 other states combined, here, he is contrasting the state\u2019s record with that of the nation as a whole.\n\nTo back up Perry\u2019s claim, his spokeswoman, Catherine Frazier, pointed us to a part of the Texas state comptroller\u2019s website that tracks economic indicators for the state. It included this information: \"By December 2011, Texas employers replaced all 433,400 jobs shed during the recession as our economy rebounded more quickly than the U.S. as a whole and continues to add jobs. Nationally, through January 2012, only 36 percent of recession-hit jobs have been recovered.\"\n\nR.J. DeSilva, a spokesman for Comptroller Susan Combs, sent us the details of how the Texas-U.S. comparison was worked up, calling it a \"peak-to-trough analysis\" that shows the pace of job recovery in Texas compared to the U.S. \"The analysis is done to show the negative effect on employment in Texas from the pre-recession peak number of jobs to its trough, and the number of jobs (that) have been added back since then. The same analysis is used for the U.S. employment peak through its trough.\"\n\nDeSilva told us that the analysis was done using nonfarm employment figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nLet\u2019s start by looking at the national job figures.\n\nThe country\u2019s most recent recession began in December 2007 and lasted 18 months, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. U.S. employment was at its peak in January 2008, with 138 million jobs. From there, the number of jobs dropped for 25 straight months, long past the declared end of the national recession, June 2009. The number of U.S. jobs hit its trough of 129.2 million in February 2010.\n\nFor its analysis, the comptroller\u2019s office calculated the number of jobs that the nation lost as the difference between the peak and the trough, for a net loss of 8.8 million jobs. (See graphs at right.)\n\nNext, the comptroller\u2019s office calculated the nation\u2019s net jobs gained over the 23 months that followed the February 2010 employment trough. The bureau\u2019s data show that in all but four of the intervening months through January 2012, the number of U.S. jobs rose. In January 2012, the most recent national jobs figure at the time of the analysis, the United States had 3.2 million more jobs than it did in February 2010.\n\nFinally, the comptroller\u2019s office compared the 3.2 million net jobs gained since February 2010 with the 8.8 million net jobs lost before then, calculating what percentage of the number lost had been gained back. That\u2019s 36 percent (3.2 million is 36 percent of 8.8 million).\n\nThe office applied the same logic and methodology to Texas\u2019 jobs numbers: calculating the number of jobs lost \u2014 on a net basis \u2014 between the state\u2019s most recent employment peak and trough, and then comparing that figure with the number of net jobs gained since the trough.\n\nTexas\u2019 job losses did not follow the same time line as the nation\u2019s. The state\u2019s total number of jobs didn\u2019t start to consistently drop until summer 2008. Also, while it took the United States 25 months to reach its most recent jobs nadir, Texas hit its low point in 16 months, with the number of jobs falling from more than 10.6 million in August 2008 to about 10.2 million in December 2009. That\u2019s a reduction of about 400,000 jobs (exact number: 433,400).\n\nTexas experienced month-to-month job gains in 20 of the 24 months after its trough. And in December 2011, the most recent jobs figure available for Texas from the BLS, the state had 440,200 more jobs than it did in December 2009.\n\nSo, Texas added more jobs after hitting its employment low than it lost in the 16 previous months. And its December 2011 total of nearly 10.7 million jobs returned the state to its pre-downturn level of employment.\n\nOne note on Perry\u2019s wording: He said his comparison was of jobs lost \"during the recession,\" but the analysis on which his statement is based wraps in job losses that occurred \u2014 nationally and in Texas \u2014 beyond the recession\u2019s end in June 2009. Still, we see that his point was to contrast how far the state and the nation have come in terms of recovering jobs that were lost during the economic downturn, and his backup, the comptroller\u2019s analysis, does that.\n\nOur ruling\n\nAs Perry indicated, Texas has as many jobs as it had before the recession \u2014 more, in fact \u2014 while the nation as a whole has not climbed as far back. Still, the Texas unemployment rate, though falling, remains higher than its pre-recession level, and, of course, not every Texan who lost a job has regained one.\n\nWe rate Perry\u2019s statement Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11457"}
