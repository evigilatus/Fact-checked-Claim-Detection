It's always for a road, a road, a road, a road, a road there, when none of us will be around or alive to see whether it's true or not.\" What is not true, in this case, is what Limbo said. We'll explain why with the help of scientists The problem of global warming is now the first in Limbo's claim: climate change is already happening. Its impact is seen all over the world. In this higher context: broad scientific consensus is that human factors are the major contributor to global warming, with CO2 emissions leading primarily to global warming, which are now reaching record levels. \"Indeed nonsense,\" is how the climate scientist Kevin Trinbert described Limbo's claim. \"We can simply look at the actual climate record,\" said Trinbert, a great scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. \"The Earth is now hotter than ever recorded.\" The last four years have been the most exciting in the records, according to an analysis by WMO of five leading international data sets. In the year 2018, the oceans as a whole containing most of the Earth &apos; s energy were the hottest oceans in the record, according to an international team of scientists tracking the data. Furthermore, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world's leading authority for climate change, has concluded with high confidence that \"the effects of global warming have already been observed on natural and human systems.\" Last summer, the Arctic ice cap in the Svalbard region of Norway was found to be 40 per cent lower than the average at that time of the year, according to the Norwegian ice circle, which traces data dating back to 1981. Scientists also point to a rise in extreme weather. Trinbert noted that rainfall was heavier in most places around the world, and that 2015 had been the most active year of recorded global hurricanes. Gavin Schmidt, a climate scientist and director of NASA's Goddard Institute of Space Studies, said, \"It's not just a set of computer models.\" \"Climatic change is visible in hundreds of independent observation data sets from land, ice, oceans and ecosystems.\" The old models have a very good record. Limbo said climate projections are always linked to some distant future, \"When none of us will be around or alive to see if they're true or not.\" He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. \u2022 January 12, 2012, but what about the predictions of the past decades? According to Zeke Hausdad, the climate scientist with Berkeley Earth, these old expectations have largely been established. \"In broad talk, climate models have been very good over the past 30 years in predicting warming in the years following their publication,\" said Hausdad, who evaluated previous climate change models in an analysis of the carbon profile website. He cited the example of Columbia University and Wally Broker, which in 1975 predicted that global temperatures would rise because of increased CO2 emissions. \"Proker predicted by 2010 that the world would heat up about 0.74C,\" said Hausdad. \"In fact, heated with 0.62 c, which is very good for a very primitive climate model in the 1970s.\" Scientists often focus on longer-term projections because, for natural change, the warming trend can be seen more clearly than this time frame, as John Riley said, the climate scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. However, many climate models are starting to simulate around 1850, and can move forward until today, until 2100. \"So there are projections for current years and the next few years,\" said Riley. Our governor, Limbo, said, \"Climatic change is nothing but a bunch of computer models that try to tell us what's going to happen in 50 or 30 years. Note that forecasts will never be for next year or for the next 10 years. It's always for a road, a road, a road, a road, a road there, when none of us will be around or alive to see whether it's true or not.\" First, global warming is already happening. The Earth is the hottest ever, and the impact can be observed. Secondly, climate change forecasts from past decades have been largely demonstrated. Third, models show more because they help to show global warming trends more clearly, for natural change. However, scientists also have available short-term expectations. We're assessing this wrong.
