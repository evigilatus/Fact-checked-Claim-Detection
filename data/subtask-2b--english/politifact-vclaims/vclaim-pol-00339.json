Indeed, much of the job growth in the state began before Richardson became governor, Peach said.\n\n\nStill, Peach said Richardson's tax incentives and income tax cuts have created a favorable atmosphere for business that is a stark change from the state's mentality in the mid-1970s, when state officials refused to provide help to a promising young company named Microsoft.\n\n\n\"The climate here has changed considerably since then,\" Peach said. \"Bill Richardson has been a big part of that. He's not the whole story, but he's been a big part of it.\"", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00339"}
