Phil Roe, R-Johnson City, of hypocrisy after he showed up at Takoma Regional Hospital in Greeneville on Jan. 5 to present a $1.3 million check from the federal government. Roe, by the way, is a physician, and his website prominently places \"M.D.\" after his name at every opportunity and mentions he has delivered \"close to 5,000 babies.\"\n\nBut Democrats are calling him a hypocrite: \"Congressman Phil Roe Hands Out $1.3M Government Check \u2013 He Voted Against,\" the party proclaimed in a press release. The release included a photo of a smiling Roe and hospital officials holding a poster-sized copy of a check, with the caption underneath reading: \"GOP Congressman Roe: Do as I say, not as I do.\"\n\nRoe is hardly the first congressman to stand accused of saying one thing and doing another. But we wondered if the charges were true: Did he really deliver a check that he voted against?\n\nThe $1.3 million that Takoma Regional received was for partial reimbursement of the health-care facility\u2019s investment in an electronic health record system that the hospital says speeds up care and gives patients electronic access to their records.\n\nThe money comes from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the economic stimulus package that Congress passed shortly after President Barack Obama took office. The legislation directed billions of dollars to encourage health-care facilities to adopt electronic record-keeping. Facilities and physicians who meet certain health and efficiency goals through their use of electronic records are eligible for reimbursement payments from the Medicare and Medicaid systems.\n\nTakoma Regional spent about $5 million converting to an electronic records system that meets the requirements set out by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The $1.3 million from the federal government was for partial reimbursement of that investment.\n\nRoe did vote against the economic stimulus package when it received final approval in the House by a vote of 246-183 on Feb. 13, 2009. In a press release at the time, Roe called the bill \"the single largest infusion of spending in American history\" and complained it had been rushed through Congress. He also argued it did not include enough funding for infrastructure projects.\n\n\"I strongly support a stimulus initiative for our nation, but it must be a stimulus bill that grows our economy, creates jobs and doesn\u2019t saddle our grandchildren with unnecessary debt,\" he said.\n\nBut while Roe voted against the stimulus funding, he did not technically vote against the check for Takoma Regional. Congress does not vote on each reimbursement check \u2013 the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services automatically distributes the money to health-care facilities and physicians that meet the criteria.\n\nIt may be a case of splitting hairs, but while Roe voted against the stimulus bill that provided the funding to reimburse Takoma Regional, he did not actually vote against the program that funded the grant to Takoma Regional \u2013 because there was no vote.\n\nOne more thing to consider: There was no actual, physical check, said Lyndon Gallimore, Takoma Regional\u2019s director for marketing and business development. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services put the money into the hospital\u2019s banking account back in November via direct deposit. The hospital made up a poster-sized copy of a fake check and invited Roe to present it at the ceremony, Gallimore said.\n\n\"We called and invited him because we felt like this was a significant first in our area,\" Gallimore said. \"He\u2019s the closest representative that we have in the federal government, and that\u2019s why we called him.\"\n\nRoe sees nothing wrong with Takoma Regional getting its share of the stimulus funding, even though he opposed the bill.\n\n\"You can\u2019t spend over $816 billion and not do some good things,\" the congressman said in a statement. \"But the real question is, was the stimulus legislation a waste of taxpayer dollars?\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nCongressman Roe voted against the stimulus bill that provided the reimbursement funding for Takoma Regional and later showed up at a ceremony in which the hospital announced it had received the funding. But because Roe did not vote against this particular hospital receiving that specific $1.3 million federal reimbursement for converting to electronic medical records, we\u2019re going with Mostly True on the Tennessee Democratic Party\u2019s claim.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11693"}
