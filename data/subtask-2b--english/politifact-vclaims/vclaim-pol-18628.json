The post continues in another image, specifying, \"Enrique Tarrio is the Florida state director of Miami-based Latinos for Trump, and the national chairman of Proud Boys.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe post came from an unverified Instagram account called Cubanos con Biden, translated Cubans with Biden in English. A spokesperson for former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign said the post was not official campaign communication.\nHere\u2019s what we know: Tarrio is the current chairman of the Proud Boys, according to the New York Times and the Anti-Defamation League. He is also listed as the Florida state director of a group called Latinos for Trump, which is run by organization president Bianca Gracia.\nTarrio ran to represent Florida\u2019s 27th Congressional District, but he struggled with fundraising and ultimately dropped out of the race before the August primary.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut here\u2019s where things get nuanced: the Latinos for Trump group that Tarrio is involved in is not directly associated with the official Trump campaign, as its name might suggest.\u00a0\nGarcia and Tarrio\u2019s Latinos for Trump site includes a small but important disclaimer at the bottom of its homepage: \"Latinos for Trump is not affiliated with, authorized, or sponsored by Donald J. Trump, Inc. which is the principal campaign committee of President Donald J. Trump.\"\nKen Farnaso, a spokesperson for the official Trump campaign, also confirmed Tarrio holds no position within Trump\u2019s official campaign organization.\n\"Mr. Tarrio is not affiliated with the Trump Campaign, the family, or our official Latinos for Trump coalition,\" he said. \"He is also not the state director of our coalition and is not on our advisory board.\"\nThe Trump campaign has sent cease and desist letters to the unofficial Latinos for Trump group. Among other things, the letters requested the group include \"prominent disclaimers\" on each page of its website and on its marketing and promotional materials that indicate the group is not affiliated with the official Trump campaign.\nThe official Latinos for Trump campaign website lists its advisory board members, and Tarrio is not among them.\nOur ruling\nAn Instagram post says, \"The leader of Proud Boys is the Florida state director of Latinos for Trump.\"\nEnrique Tarrio, who is chairman of the Proud Boys, is also the Florida state director of a group called Latinos for Trump. However, the Latinos for Trump group Tarrio helps run is not affiliated with the official Trump campaign in any way.\u00a0\nThe statement is partially accurate but leaves out important context: there are two Latinos for Trump groups \u2014 one sanctioned by the Trump campaign and another outside the campaign\u2019s purview. This post inaccurately suggests the Trump campaign hired a leader of the Proud Boys to run some campaign operations in Florida. That\u2019s not what happened.
