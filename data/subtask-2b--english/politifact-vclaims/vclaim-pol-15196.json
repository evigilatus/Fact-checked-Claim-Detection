Bush through nearly two terms as governor and two more as president, recently issued a barbed claim about Democrats paying back Kay Bailey Hutchison.\nRove, whose clients before Bush bid for governor included Hutchison, writes in his autobiography, \u201cCourage and Consequence, My Life as a Conservative in The Fight\u201d: \u201cKay Bailey Hutchison was elected state treasurer, succeeding Ann Richards. Democrats then abolished the position, which made me wonder if political payback is about the only grounds on which Democrats abolish government posts. Hutchison later became a U.S. senator.\u201d The book was released March 9.\nRove correctly reflects on Hutchison winning election as state treasurer in 1990, succeeding Richards, who won election as governor.\nHowever, we're intrigued by Rove\u2019s statements about what happened next: According to him, Democrats then abolished the treasurer\u2019s position. Later, Hutchison was elected to the U.S. Senate.\nRove told us he stands by his account.\nChronologically speaking, for starters, it's not so: Hutchison won her Senate seat in June 1993 while still serving as state treasurer, and the treasury remained a stand-alone agency after Hutchison left for Washington. Richards appointed an East Texas Democrat, Martha Whitehead, to serve out Hutchison\u2019s term. Whitehead won election in her own right in 1994.\nSo when -- and how -- was the treasurer's job abolished?\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to legislative records, the Democratic-majority 1995 Legislature proposed a constitutional amendment abolishing the agency and shifting its operations elsewhere.\nContrary to Rove's take, it wasn\u2019t a move backed solely by Democrats. Senate Joint Resolution 1 was authored by Sen. Rodney Ellis, D-Houston, and sponsored in the House by Reps. Mark Stiles, D-Beaumont, and Bill Siebert, R-San Antonio. The proposed amendment cleared the Senate by 23-7 with five Republicans and two Democrats voting \"no\" and the House by 107-18 with several Republicans who voted \u201cno\u201d saying afterward they\u2019d intended to vote \u201cyes,\u201d according to Senate and House journals.\nTexas voters approved the change by 69 percent to 31 percent in November 1995. And Whitehead--who\u2019d campaigned for election vowing to eliminate the agency\u2014marked her last day in office Aug. 31, 1996 by scraping her name and title off the glass front of the agency\u2019s Austin headquarters. \u201cI am the last treasurer of the State of Texas,\u201d she said.\nAnother Democrat, State Comptroller John Sharp, had proposed the agency\u2019s abolition in a report issued in 1994, after Hutchison was already in the Senate. His report called the treasury a \u201cbureaucracy with an annual operating budget of more than $11 million whose most important tasks are duplicated elsewhere across state government\u2026 Consolidating the bulk of the State Treasury's responsibilities with those of the Comptroller's office would cut costs, improve services and maintain accountability. It would also offer Texans the chance to prove that they're serious about reducing the size of their state government.\u201d\nHow does Rove\u2019s statement shape up?\nAs noted, he's correct that Hutchison succeeded Richards as treasurer. But he's wrong about the order of subsequent events, and assigns an unsupported motive\u2014that Democrats abolished the agency because a Republican had its top spot. Some Republicans backed the abolition, too, and it was Hutchison\u2019s Democratic successor whose stint in the office came to a sign-scraping close.\nWe rate Rove\u2019s poor job of retelling history as False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-15196"}
