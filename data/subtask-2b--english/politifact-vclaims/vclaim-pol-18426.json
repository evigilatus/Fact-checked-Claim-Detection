The story claims that \"the progressive activists\" plan to riot while disguised as Trump supporters \"in order to make the case that Donald Trump truly is a dictator that must be violently overthrown if he wins or arrested and prosecuted if he loses.\"\u00a0\nIt says that \"a source that has always been reliable was able to photograph an Antifa flyer.\" And an accompanying image of the supposed flyer reads: \"Election Day nears Comrades!!! Prepare to defend your rights!!\" It reminds \"Antifa Comrades\" to disguise themselves as \"patriots/Trump supporters\" on Nov. 4 by wearing \"MAGA hats, USA flags, 3%er insignias\" or \"a convincing police uniform.\"\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Sometimes antifa activists are violent but experts say most of the activity that happens under the antifa banner is nonviolent.\u00a0\nThe image of the flyer has been online since at least 2017, when online rumors claimed that antifa activists were planning a revolution that would begin on Nov. 4.\u00a0\u00a0\nIt started to spread on social media after it appeared in a Facebook group called \"Hickman County Antifa.\" The user who originally posted it there, Katy Krasnow, has told fact-checkers that she shared it as a joke.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.

Nobody in the group was really actually connected. We were just sharing dumb antifa memes.\"\nIn 2017, Will Sommer, a Daily Beast politics reporter who covers conservative media, described the flyer in a Medium post as one of several \"fabricated \u2018planning documents\u2019 that urge antifa guerillas to commit violence while posing as police or Trump supporters.\"\u00a0\nIn June, a Twitter account \u2014 @ANTIFA_US \u2014 appeared to call for violence, rallying \"comrades\" to move into residential areas and \"take what\u2019s ours.\" But the account wasn\u2019t actually affiliated with antifa activists; it was created by a known white supremacist group.\u00a0\nAnd on Sept. 4, Law Enforcement Today, which \"unapologetically supports those who hold the Thin Blue Line,\" published a story about the flyer being shared on Facebook.\n\"While I personally loathe the likes of Antifa and their tactics,\" the author wrote, \"I can assure you that this is simply a hoax.\"\u00a0\nWe rate this blog post False.\nThis fact check is available at IFCN\u2019s 2020 US Elections #Chatbot on WhatsApp. Click here, for more.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18426"}
