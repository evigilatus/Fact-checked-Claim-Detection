After spending some of Wednesday retweeting news that her post was trending internationally, she later deleted her account.\nTrump was endorsed by the KKK\u2019s official newspaper. And after his victory became official Wednesday morning, former KKK Imperial Wizard David Duke tweeted: \"This is one of the most exciting nights of my life. Make no mistake about it, our people have played a HUGE role in electing Trump!\"\nHowever, there's no proof that the Klan was on the march in North Carolina, like the viral post claimed.\nThe photo appears to show a group of Trump supporters that local media also interviewed.\nAnd according to that news report and follow-up interviews,\u00a0none of them were wearing KKK regalia, carrying Confederate flags or doing anything else that would link them to the racist group.\nThe scene on the bridge\nAlthough the tweet claimed\u00a0the marchers were on the bridge in Mebane Wednesday morning, they were actually there on Tuesday afternoon and night.\nNatalie Allison Janicello, a reporter for the local Burlington Times-News, was there interviewing them. She said she\u2019s sure the group in the viral post is the same group she spoke with;\u00a0she could recognize\u00a0the same flags and the neon yellow shirt of someone in the photo.\nNone of them\u00a0were\u00a0wearing any KKK regalia, she said, or carrying flags associated with the Confederacy or white supremacy movements. Instead, they had Trump signs, red-white-and-blue scarves and an assortment of American, Christian and \"Don\u2019t Tread On Me\" flags.\n\"There was no one claiming or professing to be part of the KKK,\" Janicello said. \"These were just local conservatives who were out there for Trump.\"\nJanicello said they had actually come to that spot a few times a month, since February, to wave flags to passing traffic.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeremy \"Spike\" Cohen\n\n\nstated on January 22, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays the Biden administration labeled Libertarians terrorists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Czopek \u2022 January 22, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurthermore, neither the Mebane Police Department nor the Alamance County Sheriff\u2019s Office received complaints of KKK activity close to the election \u2013 either at that bridge or anywhere else in the area.\u00a0The sheriff\u2019s office said in a press release Wednesday that calls only started coming in after the photo went viral,\u00a0and that there\u2019s nothing to substantiate the rumors.\n\"Several members of law enforcement had observed these individuals over the past weeks, and never observed any paraphernalia related to the KKK nor Confederate symbols,\" the press release said. \"No suspicious activity was observed nor reported.\"\nThe newspaper\u2019s photos from the bridge show that some of the marchers were affiliated with the group Alamance County Taking Back Alamance County (ACTBAC). It received some notoriety this summer when it began raising money to buy and install Confederate flags along Interstate 40, which is the busiest road in a number of North Carolina counties.\nBut there were no Confederate flags or KKK regalia visible at the Trump celebration, Janicello said. She also interviewed an Alamance County Republican Party official at the bridge, but party leaders later told us there was no formal connection.\n\"I haven\u2019t even heard of what you\u2019re talking about,\" said Ben York, the Alamance County Republican Party chairman, several hours after the image had gone viral.\nThe KKK in North Carolina\nDespite there being no proof behind the viral claim, Alamance County\u00a0was one of the major early hotbeds of KKK activity in North Carolina.\nIn an 1870 incident known as the Kirk-Holden War, a band of Klan supporters from Alamance and Caswell counties attempted to capture the town of Pittsboro in neighboring Chatham County. They were defeated by a militia formed by Gov. William Holden, who also arrested some prominent Klan supporters. That infuriated white supremacist state lawmakers, who soon made Holden the first governor in U.S. history to be impeached and removed from office. Holden was pardoned by the N.C. Senate in 2011.\nThe contemporary KKK has also found support in the central\u00a0area of the state, called the Piedmont, which includes Alamance County.\n\"In North Carolina, one of its banner states, the modern Klan thrived among mill workers and other blue-collar laborers in the Piedmont,\" according to the 2006 book Encyclopedia of North Carolina.\nOur ruling\nA viral post on social media claimed to show KKK members marching in Mebane, N.C. on Wednesday morning after Trump won the election.\nTrump has been supported by the KKK, and that area of North Carolina does have longstanding ties to KKK activity. But thanks to a newspaper reporter who was at the scene, and whose reporting was corroborated by local law enforcement, we know that there\u2019s no substance to the rumors.\nThe people were not wearing KKK regalia and didn\u2019t even have a Confederate flag amongst them. They also were never overheard saying anything about the KKK \u2013 they were simply excited for Trump.\nWe rate this claim False.\u00a0\nUPDATE\nAfter we wrote this, the KKK did hold a widely publicized \"victory\" parade in North Carolina, celebrating Donald Trump's presidential win. But that doesn't change anything about this rating, since they were separate events on different days and in different places.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a38543ff-c4c5-4840-a02d-937ad5424535", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03950"}
