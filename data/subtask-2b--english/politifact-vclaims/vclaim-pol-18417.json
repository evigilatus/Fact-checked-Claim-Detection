They had hundreds of cars.\"\nThe FBI\u2019s San Antonio office said Nov. 1 that it is \"aware of the incident and investigating.\"\nTrump\u2019s benevolent explanation lacks evidence.\nThe incident in question happened Friday, not Saturday. Neither Biden nor Democratic vice presidential nominee Sen. Kamala Harris were on the bus. Aboard were campaign staffers and Wendy Davis, a Texas Democratic congressional candidate, Biden\u2019s campaign said.\nTrump\u2019s campaign did not respond to our request for information.\nBiden bus surrounded by Trump supporters on I-35 in Texas\nBiden\u2019s campaign said that on Oct. 30, a Biden campaign bus was traveling on I-35 in Texas from San Antonio to Austin \"when multiple vehicles with Trump signs and flags surrounded the bus and attempted to slow the bus down and run it off the road. They pulled in front of the bus and slowed down to try to stop the bus in the middle of the highway.\"\nStaff on the bus called the police, which assisted the bus in reaching its destination, the campaign said. The campaign said it canceled its events that day at the Texas AFL-CIO parking lot in Austin and that law enforcement came to help staff, surrogates and volunteers get off of the bus.\n\"Rather than engage in productive conversation about the drastically different visions that Joe Biden and Donald Trump have for our country, Trump supporters in Texas instead decided to put our staff, surrogates, supporters, and others in harm\u2019s way,\" said in a statement Tariq Thowfeek, the Texas communications director for the Biden campaign.\nKatie Naranjo, chair of the Travis County Democratic Party, tweeted Oct. 30 that Trump supporters \"followed the Biden bus throughout central Texas to intimidate Biden supporters. They ran into a person's car, yelling curse words and threats.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo shows man upset because he was added to the no-fly list for storming the Capitol.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ciara O'Rourke \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Hinojosa captured a video of the incident that was verified by the social media intelligence agency Storyful.
