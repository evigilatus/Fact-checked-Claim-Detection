According to tax statistics, it\u2019s a pretty overwhelming number.\n\nPresident Barack Obama has been making the most of that statistic as he promotes what he calls the \"Buffett Rule.\"\n\n\"Florida, I've told you where I stand,\" Obama said at a campaign stop in Boca Raton on April 10, 2012. \"So now it's time for members of Congress to tell you where they stand. In the next few weeks we're going to vote on something we call the Buffet Rule.\"\n\nObama\u2019s proposal is that people who have income of $1 million or more per year should be required to pay a minimum tax rate of 30 percent.\n\n\"And if we do that, then it makes it affordable for us to be able to say for those people who make under $250,000 a year, like 98 percent of American families do, then your taxes don't go up,\" Obama said.\n\nUnder current law, many high earners pay significantly less than 30 percent if their income comes from investments instead of earnings.\n\nCritics of the Buffett Rule note that it won\u2019t bring in enough income to significantly dent the budget deficit. Obama spokesman Jay Carney said the president wanted the rule to support the principle of tax fairness but conceded getting the rule passed would be an uphill battle in Congress.\n\nHere, we wanted to fact-check Obama\u2019s statement that \"98 percent of American families\" make less than $250,000 a year.\n\nThe White House\u2019s prepared materials on the Buffett Rule included statistics released annually by the Internal Revenue Service that supported the point.\n\nUsing statistics from the IRS website, we found that 137,988,219 tax returns out of 140,494,127 -- or 98.2 percent -- reported adjusted gross income of less than $250,000 a year in 2009, the most recent data available.\n\nWe rate the claim True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the 2017 tax law, \u201cpeople who make under $75,000 will have their taxes raised in 2021 and every 2 years after that until 2027.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 February 5, 2021", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11295"}
