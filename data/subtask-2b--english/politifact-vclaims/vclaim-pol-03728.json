Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, highlighted the substantial role the United States plays in funding the U.N. during the confirmation hearing for U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley.\n\"When all of our taxpayers are paying roughly 22 percent of the budget, I think they do expect to see a more efficient and an organization that's more objective and more in keeping with our values,\" Portman said on Jan. 18, 2017. \"How do you intend to support U.S. national security interests, but also ensure that the U.N. is a more effective body toward promoting a more peaceful and less volatile world?\"\nThe U.N. and U.S. budget documents show Portman\u2019s number is correct, and if peacekeeping is included, the percentage gets even higher.\nThe current U.N. regular budget calls for $5.4 billion over two years. By a formula based on the size of a country\u2019s economy and other factors, America\u2019s assessment is set at 22 percent, or about $1.2 billion.\nBased on the last Obama administration budget, the United States provided $1.2 billion to the U.N. over two years, and Portman is correct.\nBut that\u2019s just for the U.N.\u2019s regular budget. There are over a dozen other U.N. agencies and operations that American dollars also support. The single largest is peacekeeping with a price tag of about $7.8 billion this year alone. The U.S. share of that cost is over 28 percent, or $2.2 billion.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaniel Greenfield\n\n\nstated on July 30, 2015 in an article on the Frontpage website\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Obama spent $7 billion to bring electricity to Africa, failed miserably.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jon Greenberg \u2022 February 11, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next three U.N. agencies -- all roughly in the $100 million per year range -- are the World Health Organization, the Food and Agriculture Organization and the International Atomic Energy Agency.\nAll told, the United States provides about $3.3 billion a year to finance U.N. activities. A 40 percent cut would save taxpayers about $1.3 billion out of the current $4.1 trillion U.S. federal budget. The impact on the U.N. would be substantial, although the precise effect would depend on how the cuts are spread around.\nOur ruling\nPortman said American taxpayers cover 22 percent of the U.N. budget. Budget documents from the U.N. and the United States confirm that. The percentage for peacekeeping operations is even higher.\nWe rate this claim True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/63427eda-6b4a-44ef-8a7b-173dcc05f504", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03728"}
