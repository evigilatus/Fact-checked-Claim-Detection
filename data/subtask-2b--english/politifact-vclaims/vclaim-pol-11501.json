She could face a $1,000 fine.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOne of the people Colbert interviewed for his sarcastic report is Howard Simon, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida. Florida officials claimed they needed to pass the law to prevent voter fraud, but these cases are actually pretty rare, he said.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"There are probably a larger number of shark attacks in Florida than there are cases of voter fraud,\" he said.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe couldn\u2019t resist diving in: Are there more shark attacks than cases of voter fraud in Florida?\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe compiled this chart using data from the Florida Department of State, which monitors elections, and the Florida Museum of Natural History in Gainesville, which has a renowned ichthyology department. (Ichthyology \u00a0is the study of fish.)\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe shark attack figures include documented instances of sharks attacking human victims. The voter fraud cases indicate the number of cases deemed legally sufficient for an investigation by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFLORIDA\n\n\n\n2008\n\n\n\n2009\n\n\n\n2010\n\n\n\n2011\n\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n\n\n\nSharks attacks\n\n\n\n28\n\n\n\n19\n\n\n\n14*\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\n\n72\n\n\n\n\n\nVoter fraud cases\n\n\n\n16\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n14\n\n\n\n49\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*includes one fatal attack\n\n\u00a0\n\nIf we were considering 2011 alone, when voter fraud cases exceeded shark attacks, this could have been ruled False. But spreading our data out over four years shows shark attacks happen more frequently than voter fraud cases.\n\n \u00a0\n\nFlorida regularly leads the country in unprovoked shark attacks. In 2011, Florida\u2019s 11 attacks comprised 38 percent of the nation\u2019s total and 15 percent of the world\u2019s attacks. Volusia County, home to the spring-break mecca of Daytona Beach, had the most attacks (six).\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhile the shark attack figures are cut and dry (sorry!), the voter fraud numbers are not. There could be more cases than we know about, involving more people. The numbers\u00a0may not represent total voter fraud cases, as those could be handled by local supervisors and state attorneys.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAlso, one \"case\" may represent multiple counts of voter fraud, perpetrated by multiple people, said agency spokesman Chris Cate. He points to a November 2011 case that resulted in the arrests of nine people from the North Florida town of Madison, including the supervisor of elections.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOn the other hand, the fraud list does not count only convictions. So some of these cases could be proven unfounded.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe ACLU\u2019s claim is true on its face, but we\u2019re knocking it down a peg with consideration of a few things. One, the state\u2019s count doesn\u2019t represent a complete set of possible fraud being prosecuted in the state. Two, a \"case\" does not always include just one instance of fraud.\n\n\u00a0\n\nUsing the Madison case as an example, we know nine people were arrested in just one case.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe rate this Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11501"}
