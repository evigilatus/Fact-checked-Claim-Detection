It simply measures consistency in positions over time.\nSome argue a change demonstrates an openness to new facts or a willingness to compromise. Others say it is evidence of inconsistent principles or lack of backbone.\nSo, where does Holtz stand?\nHoltz is a former Wisconsin principal of the year at Peshtigo Elementary School. He served 13 years as a school district administrator in the Palmyra, Beloit and Whitnall districts.\nHe was running Whitnall in 2010 when Evers determined to put Common Core in place in Wisconsin after the Council of Chief State School Officers and the National Governors Association Center for Best Practices led the drafting process.\nIn 2012, a CNI NOW newspaper story quoted Holtz saying he supported the standards. Holtz told the publication the standards concentrate on facts as related to real life rather than the traditional straight ahead factual approach.\nIn 2013, the same publication quoted Holtz this way:\n\"The change is absolutely in the best interests of the kids of Wisconsin. Raising the bar will make our kids more competitive not only at the state level but at the national level.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe called it a \"fun, exciting time to be involved in education.\"\nBy July 2016, when he announced his bid, it was clear Holtz was taking a different tack. He stressed local control and said Common Core was not necessarily effective because each community is different.\nThe Beloit Daily News quoted Holtz as saying the Common Core must be fought.\n\"Happy to be part of a panel discussing Education Reform and the dangers of Common Core,\" he tweeted in November 2016.\nHoltz explained the switch in a Feb. 6, 2017 blog post about his plan to work with the governor and legislators to wipe out Common Core if elected.\nState and school leaders, he said, were misled through \"high pressure marketing\" to adopt Common Core at the risk of politicizing curriculum decisions.\nHis new position won support from conservatives including former state Rep. Don Pridemore, a Republican who ran unsuccessfully in 2013 for state school superintendent.\n\"Dr. Holtz will fight for local control and against Federal takeover programs like Common Core,\" Pridemore is quoted on Holtz\u2019s campaign web site.\nHoltz campaign spokesman Brit Schiel acknowledged that Holtz\u2019s position has changed. He said it had evolved in line with Gov. Scott Walker\u2019s.\nIn January 2015, PolitiFact Wisconsin rated as a Half Flip Gov. Scott Walker\u2019s change in position to oppose Common Core.\nDuring most of his first term, the governor showed tacit support. By mid-2013, he was hitting the pause button on further implementation of the standards. In mid-2014, Walker called for an outright repeal. But by January 2015, he was saying only that he didn\u2019t want school districts required to use Common Core.\nHoltz, Schiel said, \"grew uncomfortable with Common Core\u2019s inefficiencies, its one-size-fits-all approach to education, and the fact that the standards were coming from Washington, not from the local school boards.\"\nOur rating\nHoltz definitely was for Common Core before he was against it.\nThe change is stark.\nThis major reversal of position merits a Full Flop.\n\nShare the Facts\n\n\nPolitifact\n\n\n8\n6\n Politifact Rating:\n\u00a0\n\nOn using the Common Core standards for English and math instruction\n\n\n\nLowell Holtz\nWisconsin state school superintendent candidate\n\n\nIn a campaign statement\nThursday, February 2, 2017\n02/02/2017\n\n\nRead More\ninfo", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03669"}
