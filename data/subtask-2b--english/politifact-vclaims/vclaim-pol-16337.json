John McCain. He has gone so far as to say he will not vote for the first time in his life this November if McCain is the Republican nominee.\n\nIn a statement read by Laura Ingraham on her radio show, Dobson attacked McCain's conservative credentials, specifically his collegiality with Democrats. Dobson emphasized that the statement was his personal opinion, not that of Focus on the Family.\n\n\n\"I am convinced Sen. McCain is not a conservative, and in fact, has gone out of his way to stick his thumb in the eyes of those who are,\" the statement reads. \"He has at times sounded more like a member of the other party. McCain actually considered leaving the GOP in 2001, and approached John Kerry about being Kerry's running mate in 2004. McCain also said publicly that Hillary Clinton would make a good president. Given these and many other concerns, a spoonful of sugar does not make the medicine go down. I cannot, and I will not vote for Sen. John McCain, as a matter of conscience.\"\n\n\nWe've addressed a claim on McCain being considered as a running mate to John Kerry\n\nhere.\n\nSo we'll focus on Dobson's claim that McCain once said Sen. Clinton would make a good president.\n\n\nAccording to a transcript of\n\nMeet the Press,\n\nDobson is right.\n\n\nWrapping up a Feb. 20, 2005, appearance from Baghdad during a joint trip, the senators praised each other in a light-hearted exchange. McCain even ended the interview by acknowledging what trouble he'd gotten into.\n\n\nRussert: \"Senator McCain, a serious question: Do you think the lady to your right would make a good president?\"\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.
