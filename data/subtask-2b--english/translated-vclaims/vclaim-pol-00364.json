Twenty-two people were killed and more than 20 injured after an armed man opened fire at the store earlier that day. Twenty people were reportedly killed on the day of the shooting and two later died in hospital, according to the El Paso Police Department. Orok, who seeks a democratic presidential nomination, told journalists that the people he met at the hospital \"are asking us to do something about it.\" \"Yeah, it's weapons laws. Yeah, it's a thorough background check. Yes, we must stop selling weapons of war to our societies, \"Oork said, born and raised in El Paso. \"But I think we must also face this hatred that I have never seen in my life, and we certainly have not seen in El Paso. In some years, in a city of about 700,000, we've had five murders all year. Our average for the past 10 years is 18 (murder per year). We've passed that rate in just one day. That's not normal. It's unacceptable. We can't move on from this, and the people I just met don't want us to move on.\" Do you think that Jehovah's Witnesses will be able to help you to help you in your life? After looking at the figures that Aurourke Chris Evans said his figures came from a January news release from El Paso, she looked at the annual number of murders per year in El Paso over the past 59 years - from 1960 to 2018. During that period, it was the year of most murders in 1993, when 56 murders were recorded in the city. Next year the closest was 1980, when there were 54 murders. In 1964 and 2010, there were only five murders in the city. In 1965, there were nine murders, the only other year during this period when the total number of murders was in one place. The fact-finding bloggers wrote on January 30, 2021 in a post entitled \"Frustration of Tramp's assassination, the deep state in panic!\" by Sierra Orourc: 4 February 2021 over the entire 59 years, the average number of murders in the city was 23 per year. Over the past 10 years, from 2008 to 2018, the average number of homicides was 18.1 per year. Aurourke often throws crime numbers from El Paso to say that the city is among the safest in the country. The FBI cautions against using its standardized crime statistics to classify sites and researchers caution against classifying societies according to relative safety. Without categorizing the regions, FBI data show that the rate of violent crime in El Paso was much lower than the average in all areas of similar size (with a population of 500,000 to 999,999), each year from 1985 to 2017, the last year available from the FBI. Governor O'Rourke said some years in El Paso, \"In a city of about 700,000, we had five murders a year. Our average for the past 10 years is 18 (murder per year). We've passed this rate in just one day after an armed man shot Wal-Mart in the city. Let's take this term piece by piece. The population of El Paso was approximately 682,669 in 2018, according to United States census estimates. In 1964 and 2010, five murders were recorded during the year in the city. The average number of homicides per year in the city has been 18.1 over the past 10 years. On Saturday, 20 people were killed and more than 24 injured after an armed man shot Walmart in El Paso. Two people later died in the hospital. We're assessing this claim right. The truth is - the statement is accurate and nothing important is missing.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00364"}
