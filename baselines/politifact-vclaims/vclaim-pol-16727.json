Sean Casten countered critics who argue the plan limits funding for research and development of new life-saving medications.\nPolitiFact has already evaluated a version of that critique made by a drug manufacturers\u2019 group, rating it Mostly False. During a recent Facebook livestream, Casten of Downers Grove struck back at the plan\u2019s critics with an entirely different claim on the subject that also caught our attention.\n\"From 2000 to 2016, every major drug that was introduced came out of NIH funding,\" Casten said. \"That is your taxpayer dollars. And so what we\u2019ve done with the savings from this bill, which are huge, is to funnel a significant chunk of that back to NIH.\"\nCasten was referring to the National Institutes of Health, which is part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and serves as the nation\u2019s medical research agency.\nA peer-reviewed study found that NIH funding contributed to scientific findings underpinning every one of the more than 200 new drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration over the timeframe it covered. But the study only dated back to 2010 \u2014 not 2000, as Casten claimed.\nIn response to our inquiry, Casten\u2019s office updated his Facebook video post with a correction.\n\"At minute 4:17, Congressman Casten stated from \u20182000 to 2016, every major drug that was introduced came out of NIH funding.\u2019 The correct date range is 2010-2016,\u2019\" the post now reads.\nStill, we wanted to set the record straight for those who haven\u2019t seen the update, and provide some additional context about the overall issue.\nMajor drug pricing bill\nCasten raised the public funding for new drug research issue while advocating for Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s plan to rein in prescription drug prices.\nThe plan would direct Medicare to negotiate the cost of a limited number of drugs, cap what Medicare patients pay out-of-pocket at $2,000 per year and require companies that raise prices beyond inflation to give rebates back to the government.\nThe bill \u2014 House Resolution 3 \u2014 passed the House on Dec. 12 with a mostly party-line vote. While not expected to gain approval in the Republican-run U.S. Senate, it is the latest foray by Democrats in a political battle over prescription drugs that has existed for years. It also represents a framework for how Democrats propose tackling the perennial issue of rising prescription drug prices.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe study Casten cited\nIn 2017, researchers analyzed the contribution NIH funding has made to research associated with all 210 new drugs approved by the FDA between 2010 and 2016. Collectively, they found, the grant funding for this research totaled more than $100 billion.\nBecause 95% of those funds went toward the kind of foundational biomedical research that can contribute to the creation of multiple drugs rather than a specific drug product, the report concludes, NIH \"complements industry research and development, which focuses predominantly on applied research.\"\nThe study\u2019s lead author, data analyst Ekaterina Cleary of Bentley University in Massachusetts, told us she wasn\u2019t aware of any similar studies dating further back. She said Casten\u2019s broader take that every new drug introduced within her study\u2019s time frame \"came out of NIH funding\" checks out.\n\"I would say that\u2019s true,\" she said. \"Government funding contributes to basic science that enables successful development. Obviously, without that basic research, you can\u2019t develop the drug.\"\nHowever, Cleary added, the costly clinical trials that manufacturers conduct are also crucial to creating new medications.\n\"I know our study is frequently interpreted as, \u2018the public sector developed these drugs,\u2019 but they didn\u2019t do it single-handedly,\" she said. \"So it\u2019s an important distinction to make to acknowledge pharmaceutical companies\u2019 role in the trials that they develop.\"\nOur ruling\nCasten said that \"from 2000 to 2016, every major drug that was introduced came out of NIH funding.\"\nA 2018 study found NIH funding contributed to the science that underlies every one of the 210 new drugs approved by the FDA between 2010 and 2016 \u2014 not 2000 to 2016, as Casten claimed.\nFollowing our inquiry, his office posted a correction on Facebook.\nCasten misstated the time period covered by the report, but his overall point tracks with its findings. So we rate his claim Half True.\n\nHALF TRUE \u2013 The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-16727"}
