Only in a pinch, experts warn.", "text": "As COVID-19 cases continue to climb, front-line health care workers are decrying unsafe working conditions \u2014 in particular, describing inadequate access to personal protective equipment, or PPE. Many hospitals and state lawmakers blame Washington, saying the Trump administration has not done enough to make this critical protective gear available.\u00a0\nBut at a recent press conference, President Donald Trump suggested those claims are overblown, asserting instead that hospitals have the tools they need to sanitize and reuse protective facewear.\n\"We\u2019re also using a sterilization process \u2015 some great equipment that will sterilize masks up to 20 times per mask. So that\u2019s like ordering 20 times more masks. And it\u2019s working very well,\" Trump said at the April 23 briefing.\n\nIn fact, the question of reusing masks \u2014 specifically, the highly effective N95 respirators that best protect wearers from COVID-19 \u2015 has emerged as a major worker-safety concern. Traditionally, the masks have been designated only for single use.\nBut with hospitals running low on protective equipment, many seek to stretch their supplies.\nWith that context, we were curious \u2014 can N95s be sterilized and reused, as Trump suggested? And if so, are disinfected masks as protective as new ones?\nWe contacted the White House but never heard back. Our own research revealed the situation is more complex than Trump suggested. Hospitals are using new technology to sterilize masks. Some procedures do show promise. Still, according to experts we consulted, it\u2019s an overstatement to suggest they are as effective as getting new equipment.\nThe Battelle process\nTrump appears to be referencing technology from the Battelle Memorial Institute, a nonprofit technology company in Ohio. Battelle, which has an in-house \"critical care decontamination system,\" received emergency authorization from the Food and Drug Administration to sanitize N95s for reuse.\nHospitals send used N95s to Battelle, which has also set up N95 sanitization centers in coronavirus hot spots, including New York, Boston, Seattle and Washington, D.C.\nWorkers wearing protective gear load the respirators into a sealed container. Masks are cleaned with vapor-phase hydrogen peroxide, aerated and then sent back to the originating hospitals. The decontamination process takes about 12 hours. A mask\u2019s round-trip journey from a hospital to Battelle in Ohio and back again can take about 10 days.\nBattelle said masks can withstand the decontamination process up to 20 times without losing their ability to filter out viral particles.\nSo, the president is right that this technology exists. But is it fair to say the approach is the equivalent of buying new gear?\nPut simply, no. Experts are clear that decontamination works in the current emergency. But \u2015 despite Trump\u2019s enthusiasm \u2014 it is not a best practice.\n\"It\u2019s not accurate to say that reprocessing respirators is as good as purchasing 20 of them,\" said Dr. Patrick Kenney, medical director of Yale-New Haven Health\u2019s supply chain, who has also researched decontamination technology and processing. \"This is not a renewable resource. The respirators are intended for single use.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, in its letter designating emergency approval, the FDA specified that Battelle\u2019s decontamination system \"may be effective\" at protecting wearers but advised it specifically for \"when there are insufficient supplies.\" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also recommends reuse \"only be practiced as a crisis capacity strategy.\"\nThe reasons are multiple. For one thing, research is limited on how effective this type of decontamination is. Also, masks vary in how they stand up to the procedure.\nAnd it\u2019s not as simple as doing a load of laundry. \"Decontamination is a complicated process,\" said Hana El-Samad, a professor of biochemistry and biophysics at the University of California-San Francisco, who researches N95 sanitization. \"Assessing how well it works and which N95 makes and models remain unaffected is an area of active research,\" she said.\u00a0\nN95Decon, a research collaborative with which El-Samad works, has examined Battelle\u2019s hydrogen peroxide approach and found the chemicals appear to eliminate COVID-19 spores without damaging the mask\u2019s filtration.\nMask integrity\nPerformance is only part of the equation. Another is mask structure: N95s work only when properly fitted to the face.\nWhen workers reuse and re-wear the masks, they can lose their shape, which undermines the quality of fit and renders them less protective. For some masks, per an N95 report on hydrogen peroxide, fit quality declined substantially after just five uses. For others, it took 15 wears to see a meaningful difference.\nAt Yale-New Haven, Kenney said, the hospital discards 20% to 30% of respirators that could have been refurbished before they hit the 20-reuse mark because they had sustained too much wear and tear. Battelle\u2019s 20-time reusability metric, he added, was calculated without factoring in the impact of regular hospital use.\nIn addition, decontamination itself can in some cases worsen the respirator\u2019s fit.\u00a0\n\"If [an N95] doesn\u2019t fit well, then air will leak around the sides and it doesn\u2019t matter how good a filter it is,\" Kenney said.\nPlus, using this technology requires hospitals to have other protocols in place. Used masks must be safely collected \u2015 since they could be COVID-contaminated and pose a biohazard \u2014 and a plan must be in place to move them to and from the sanitization facility.\u00a0\n\"These are all complicated processes that need to be done right,\" El-Samad said.\nShe offered a key takeaway: Technology like Battelle\u2019s can help. But nothing substitutes for new N95s.\nOur ruling\nIn describing ongoing efforts to reuse protective respirators, Trump said the United States is using \"some great equipment that will sterilize masks up to 20 times per mask.\" That, he argued, \"is like ordering 20 times more masks.\"\nIt is true that technology exists to sterilize N95s up to 20 times. But there are knowledge gaps and other shortcomings that limit how effective this process is. Government authorities and health care researchers are clear that this is a crisis measure and it is in no way as effective as \"ordering 20 times more masks.\"\nThe statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details that undermine the president\u2019s point.
