We call it false.\u00a0\nThere is no evidence that guns were seized from Lujan Grisham\u2019s home.

Some news reports have characterized the Facebook page as satire, but nothing on the site states that.\nThis false story was inspired by Lujan Grisham\u2019s support of the proposed Extreme Risk Firearm Protection Order Act that passed the state Senate on Feb. 7. It passed the House on Feb. 13. Lujan Grisham, who applauded its passage, is expected to sign the bill.\nAbout 17 states have similar \"red flag\" or extreme risk laws. The laws allow police to petition a court to order the temporary removal of firearms from a person who may be dangerous, or to block the person from obtaining a firearm. After a set amount of time, the firearm is either returned to the person or the court order is extended.\nRELATED: How Florida\u2019s red flag gun law works\nThere is no evidence that guns were seized from Lujan Grisham\u2019s home or from her security detail after passage of the law.
