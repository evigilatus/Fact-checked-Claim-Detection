And one, since, very significantly, she never campaigned during the general elections. On March 3, 2019, the speech presented by national news outlets, including C-Span, claimed that Clinton claimed tens of thousands of people in Wisconsin were \"distracted\" from polls because of their skin colour or other factors. Her remarks were part of a programme to mark the fifty-fourth anniversary of the first march from Selma to Montgomery in Ala. In her comments, Clinton said: \"I was the first person to run for president without the protection of the Voting Rights Act. I'll tell you, it makes a really big difference. This makes no difference in Alabama and Georgia. I made a difference in Wisconsin, where the best studies conducted suggest that between 40,000 and 80,000 people were removed from the ballot box because of their skin colour, because of their age, because of any excuse that could be made to prevent a fellow American citizen from voting. The number is vital, since Trump Clinton defeated 22,748 votes. And I also lost Michigan and Pennsylvania hard -- and with these two states, the presidency. Is Clinton right about Wisconsin? Do studies show \"a place between 40,000 and 80,000 people who have been removed from the ballot box because of their skin color\" and other factors? Was the lack of protection of the law on voting rights the reason for this? Our process: Read how the political book examines everyone. We have considered similar allegations in the past - including one from the United States, Sun. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis, and one from Clinton herself. Baldwin mentioned the turnout in Wisconsin \"has been reduced by about 200,000 votes due to\" a new identity requirement for photographs. Clinton later claimed \"the best estimate is that 200,000 people in Wisconsin either denied or froze in their efforts to vote\" in the 2016 presidential election. We've assessed both of them mostly wrong. Although Clinton &apos; s new claim is different, these items provide a good starting point. The 2016 competition was the first presidential election where the Wisconsin Photo Identity Act was fully in force. In submitting her claim, Baldwin cited the May 2017 report commissioned by the American Priority Action Organization, the Political Action Committee that supported Clinton and Barack Obama. Compared to the 2012 and 2016 elections, the report stated that the participation rate had increased on average 1.3 per cent in states where there had been no change in voter identification laws, but that it had decreased by 3.3 per cent in Wisconsin. If the Wisconsin Photo Identity Act were not in force, the report states, Wisconsin's turnout could have been 200,000 votes higher, based on an average increase of 1.3 per cent. On January 10, 2021, in a television interview, \"It takes a long time on election day to download those cards, which is why we have 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. to throw the ballot papers at Milwaukee.\" \u2022 On January 15, 2012, independent experts told us that the methodology in the study was not available. In short: There is no doubt that the identity requirement has prevented or frustrated some individuals from voting. But the report attributes every low turnout to identity law, when there were many other reasons that could explain it as well, including the lack of enthusiasm for Clinton or Trump -- or even the belief that Trump couldn't win in Wisconsin. In one of our previous items, we cited the perspective of Barry Borden, Director of the Electoral Research Centre at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He noted that Trump had received almost the same number of votes in Wisconsin as Matt Romney, the 2012 WDP candidate. \"Clinton, on the contrary, earned 238,000 fewer voters than Obama,\" he told us at the time. \"It would be wrong to attribute all this rejection to the voter identity requirement.\" In its new claim, Clinton attributed what happened in Wisconsin to the fact that the Voting Rights Act was no longer in force. This refers to a decision of the United States Supreme Court in 2013 that repealed section 4 of the Act. The problem: Wisconsin was never one of the states covered by that section. As our friends in the Washington Post fact checker noted in their analysis of Clinton's remarks: Wisconsin was not one of the states covered by Article 4 when the Court ruled in 2013, so Clinton's claim that this \"make a difference in Wisconsin\" is unfounded. Georgia was covered by article 4, but Clinton &apos; s claim that the total voter registration in that state had decreased from 2012 to 2016 was false; it had increased. We were unable to reach Clinton's spokesman Nick Merrill to verify our facts, but he did several studies and other arguments to the Post. The most important is a 2017 study led by Ken Mayer, a political scientist at Madison University. This study included a survey of 293 registered voters who did not vote in the provinces of Dan and Milwaukee in the 2016 elections. The study focuses on those who \"stop\" voting, which I defined as meaning \"black voters who qualify for identity or mention identity as a reason for not voting. The identity of voters may be a nominal cause or the main reason for not voting.\" We must note that Meyer told the Post that 14,000 is the \"most likely number\" of those who are blocked by the voter identification law. In any case, \"terror\" is different from \"prevention\" or - as Clinton said - \"distant.\" The study placed a much smaller group in the more stringent category of \"prevention.\" She also warned against extrapolating the results from the districts of Milwaukee and Dean to the state as a whole. But that's what Clinton did. So Clinton has problems with the low end of the range 40,000. Where does her high number (80 thousand) come from? Merle, Clinton's spokesman, told the Post that it was based on the same priority study in the United States of America that was the basis of its earlier estimate of 200,000 (often estimated to be wrong). Meryl told the Post that the 80,000 was a conservative estimate within the scope of the two studies. The Post gave Clinton the score of \"Four Pinocchio\" to review her comments. Clinton said in a speech because a key provision of the Voting Rights Act was not in fact, \"Somewhere between 40,000 and 80,000 people were removed from opinion polls (in Wisconsin) because of their skin colour\" and other factors. It is wrong that the Law on Voting Rights is not in force. This provision has never applied to Wisconsin. It also has problems with numbers on both sides of its scope. Moreover, the prosecution - and others like him - blames people who do not vote for the law on the personal identity of the State. This ignores other factors, such as the lack of enthusiasm from voters, or the belief - apparently shared by candidate Clinton - that the State was safe for it in 2016. We're assessing the allegation of pants on fire.
