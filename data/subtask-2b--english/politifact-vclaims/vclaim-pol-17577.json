David Cox, to the Clintons.\nThe post, which misspells \"Jeffrey\" for both Cox and Epstein, says:\u00a0\n\"Say hello to Jeffery David Cox the head of Federal Prison Guards in Manhattan. Jeffery is the boss of the guards who were supposed to keep Jeffery Epstein alive while in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan. He also is friends with Bill and Hillary Clinton.\"\nAlongside is a photo of Cox and Hillary Clinton looking toward the camera and shaking hands.\nThe implication of the Facebook post, which was flagged as part of the company\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed, is that Cox was in a position to have played a role in Epstein\u2019s death.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nBoth points in the post are highly misleading:\n1. Cox is president of the American Federation of Government Employees, a union based in Washington, D.C., that represents 700,000 employees at numerous work sites. He didn\u2019t work in the Manhattan jail, much less have authority to assign work shifts to the two guards or monitor their job performance.\n2. Cox supported Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign for president and his union endorsed her. But the picture of Cox and Clinton is from a union-sponsored campaign event in 2015, based on a caption published with the photo. We found no evidence of any stronger friendship.\nA spokesman for Hillary Clinton and a spokesman for Bill Clinton each told PolitiFact that it \"is utter nonsense\" that the Clintons and Cox have a friendship.\u00a0\nA spokesman for Cox referred us to an article by the fact-checking operation Snopes. That article concluded that a theory that Cox played a key role in an alleged Clinton-orchestrated conspiracy to kill Epstein was false. \"We found no publicly available evidence that he has a relationship with either Clinton that goes beyond the cordial dynamic that one would expect between a leading national labor union official and two historically powerful figures within the Democratic Party,\" Snopes wrote.\nOur ruling\nFacebook posts say J. David Cox, \"the boss\" of the jail guards \"who were supposed to keep\" suspected sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein alive, is also \"friends with Bill and Hillary Clinton.\"\nCox is president of a Washington-based national union for federal employees; he doesn\u2019t work in a Manhattan jail or have authority over its guards. And though Cox supported Hillary Clinton\u2019s run for the 2016 Democratic nomination, there is no evidence of a friendship beyond that.\nWe rate the statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17577"}
