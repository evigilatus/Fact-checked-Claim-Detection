Ron Johnson, called a recent attack ad from Johnson\u2019s camp \"simply false\" and \"intentionally misleading.\"\nThe ad accused Feingold of starting his Progressives United committee to pay himself and his staff, not to support progressive candidates. (We rated Half True a similar claim from the state GOP)\nWhen speaking to reporters in Milwaukee October 27, Feingold said about the ad: \"They don\u2019t want to talk about the fact that Senator Johnson not only loves the current finance system, but he is the one who is benefiting from several super PACs. And I am not.\"\nWe took a look at claim about who benefitted from the Progressive\u2019s United fund. In this item, we are looking at Feingold\u2019s response: That Johnson is benefiting from several super PACs, but he is not.\nWe wondered if that was right.\nUnpacking the PACs\nThe day after Feingold\u2019s statement, a major Democratic super PAC announced a $2 million ad buy on his behalf. But we\u2019re considering Feingold\u2019s claim at the time he made it.\nFeingold himself has a history with campaign finance reform \u2014 he was half of the McCain-Feingold Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, which limited the amount of money national parties can raise and spend on behalf of their candidates.\nThe act was an attempt to reign in spending, but some say it pushed donors to super PACs that can raise unlimited amounts of money but can\u2019t donate the money directly to a candidate. Which brings us to 2016.\nAt the time of Feingold\u2019s statement, both candidates had already benefited from super PACs, according to data from the Federal Election Committee\u2019s website.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo super PACs \u2014 For Our Future and Working America Coalition \u2014 had spent around $50,000 to support Feingold. And four super PACs had spent around $950,000 to support Johnson: Citizen PAC, Club for Growth Action, Freedom Partners Action Fund, and Let America Work.\nOf course, money spent to oppose a candidate also benefits the other and there was even more spent there.\nFour super PACs spent almost $640,000 to oppose Johnson: For Our Future, Working America Coalition, Planned Parenthood Votes and the League of Conservation Voters Victory Fund.\nAnd five super PACs spent more than $2.5 million to oppose Feingold: Americas PAC, Citizen PAC, Club for Growth Action, The New Prosperity Foundation and Reform Wisconsin Fund.\nSo at the time of Feingold\u2019s statement, super PACs had reported spending around $690,000 on Feingold\u2019s behalf and nearly $3.5 million on Johnson\u2019s. (As noted, an additional $2 million was directed to Feingold the next day.)\nFeingold\u2019s camp pointed to the fact that Johnson had benefited from a much larger share of super PAC spending.\nMaybe so. But that\u2019s not what Feingold said.\nOur rating\nFeingold said Johnson is \"benefiting from several super PACs. And I am not.\"\nSimply put, he was. Though such spending for Johnson has been higher, Feingold has received significant super PAC support.\nOur rating is False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03985"}
