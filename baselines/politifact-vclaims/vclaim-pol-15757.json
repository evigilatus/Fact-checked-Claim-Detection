It said that after Obama's inauguration, \"His first call to any head of state, as president, was to Mahmoud Abbas, leader of Fatah party in the Palestinian territory.\"\n\n\nWe checked the accounts of Obama's first day and found some truth to the claim. According to a statement from White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, on the morning of Obama's first full day in office, Jan. 21, 2009, the president placed brief phone calls to four Middle Eastern leaders \u2014 Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, Jordan's King Abdullah and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.\n\n\n\"He used this opportunity on his first day in office to communicate his commitment to active engagement in pursuit of Arab-Israeli peace from the beginning of his term, and to express his hope for their continued cooperation and leadership,\" Gibbs said in the statement. \"In the aftermath of the Gaza conflict, he emphasized his determination to work to help consolidate the ceasefire by establishing an effective anti-smuggling regime to prevent Hamas from rearming, and facilitating in partnership with the Palestinian Authority a major reconstruction effort for Palestinians in Gaza. He pledged that the United States would do its part to make these efforts successful, working closely with the international community and these partners as they fulfill their responsibilities as well.\u00a0 The President appreciated the spirit of partnership and warm nature of these calls.\"\n\n\nPalestinian officials on the West Bank bragged that Obama called Abbas first.\n\n\nAccording to a story in Agence France Presse on Jan. 21, 2009, Abbas spokesman Nabil Abu Rudeina quoted Obama as saying, \"This is my first phone call to a foreign leader and I'm making it only hours after I took office.\"\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

The story quotes a spokesman at the Israeli Embassy in Washington as saying his government had \"no idea\" who Obama called first; and that the White House was mum on the issue. We also got no response from the White House on the matter.\n\n\nBut we think the issue of who got called minutes before someone else is irrelevant. The point is that Obama's first calls were to leaders of this region \u2014 all of them. The e-mail may be right that Obama called Abbas first. At the very least, Abbas was among the very first. But consider the context in which the statement was made, to back up the suggestion that Obama is actually a Muslim. Assuming Obama did call Abbas first \u2014 and again, we can't confirm that \u2014 we do know that one of his very next calls was to Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. The e-mail conveniently leaves that detail out.\n\n\nHere at PolitiFact, we define a Half True statement as one that is accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We think this claim fits the bill. Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-15757"}
