They are galled by the notion of \"education governor,\" even if Walker has since been adding back funding.\nSo, let\u2019s sort out the Republican governor\u2019s record on school funding.\nWe\u2019ll use a claim by state firefighters union president Mahlon Mitchell, one of the eight Democrats hoping to win the Aug. 14, 2018, primary to run against Walker.\n\n\n\n\nAll our fact checks in the governor\u2019s race.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nThe claim\nMitchell made his claim June 19, 2018, on the \"Devil\u2019s Advocates,\" a Milwaukee-based liberal radio talk show. He declared that Walker \"has cut more from public education than he's put back in, obviously. He took $1.6 billion and some change away and then puts back $630 million, and he's calling that progress.\"\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s a claim Mitchell has made repeatedly, in one form or another, and one we\u2019re likely to hear again before the primary and the Nov. 6, 2018, general election.\nBased on previous fact checks we\u2019ve done, there is an element of truth in Mitchell\u2019s claim. But he gets into trouble, partly by mixing apples and oranges in the two figures he uses.\n\u2018Cut\u2019 $1.6 billion -- not really a cut\n\n\n\n\nLike us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nOn saying Walker cut $1.6 billion, Mitchell\u2019s campaign cited a 2013 report by the Forward Institute, a Madison-based think tank that operated for several years. The report doesn\u2019t state, though, that Walker made a $1.6 billion cut in education funding. Rather, it says he reduced by that amount the maximum that school districts could increase their property tax levies.\nThe report\u2019s author, Scott Wittkopf, who is advising the campaign of another Democrat for governor, Mike McCabe, told us Mitchell has a point but his statement reflects a common misunderstanding of the complexities of school funding.\nTo flesh this out, here\u2019s what we found in a 2011 fact check on a similar claim \u00a0\u2014 that Walker\u2019s 2011-\u201913 budget \"cuts overall funding for public schools by $1.6 billion.\" We rated it Mostly False.\n\n\nThe 2009-\u201911 state budget, the one just prior to Walker\u2019s first budget, cut state aid to schools and slowed the growth in how much school districts could raise from property taxes.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat 2009-\u201911 budget, approved by a Democratic governor and Democratic-run Legislature, also directed the next Legislature to reset the property tax limit in the 2011-\u201913 budget (Walker\u2019s first) to what it was before it was reduced.\n\n\n\n\nBut Walker and the Legislature, which had turned Republican, did not abide by that directive. Instead, the 2011-\u201913 budget imposed a lower limit on how much school districts could increase their property taxes than what the 2009-\u201911 budget called for.\n\n\nIn sum, some Democrats argue that by not abiding by the 2009-\u201911 budget directive, school districts\u00a0were prevented from levying $1.6 billion more in property taxes.\nBut that figure assumes that all school districts levy the maximum allowed in property taxes, which never occurs. And that calculation doesn\u2019t take into account some school districts\u2019 ability, under Walker\u2019s Act 10 collective bargaining legislation, to save money by requiring employees to pay more for their health and pension benefits.\nBottom line: The $1.6 billion refers to a limit on school districts\u2019 ability to increase how much they collect in property tax revenue, but it is not an actual funding cut.\nAs we found in April 2018, in a fact checking a claim by another of the Democratic candidates, Tony Evers, the actual reduction in state funding of schools over the two-year period of Walker\u2019s 2011-\u201913 state was $784 million.\n\u2018Put back\u2019 $630 million -- no, more than that\nThe other part of Mitchell\u2019s claim is meant to convey that, even though Walker touts recent increases he\u2019s made in school funding, those increases don\u2019t come close to making up what was cut.\nBut Mitchell gets into trouble because, while the first part of his claim refers to the ability of school districts to raise taxes, the second part of his claim refers to actual cash that the state gives to school districts.\nMoreover, in saying that only $630 million has been put back, Mitchell\u2019s campaign cites only Walker\u2019s 2017-\u201919 state budget, which increases state funding to schools by $639 million. It provides for an additional $200 per student in the first year and additional $204 in the second year, as Walker now touts in his re-election campaign.\nBut that wasn\u2019t the first time Walker has increased state funding to schools. In fact, in each budget since the 2011 budget that reduced school funding, he has increased state funds to schools. The total restored is about $1 billion.\nThat being said, as we found in the Evers fact check, during Walker\u2019s tenure school districts have collected about $183.6 million less in state money than they would have had funding levels remained where they were when Walker took office.\nOur rating\nMitchell says Walker \"has cut more from public education than he's put back in, obviously. He took $1.6 billion and some change away and then puts back $630 million and he's calling that progress.\"\nWalker\u2019s first state budget in 2011 did reduce by $1.6 billion the maximum amount that school districts had expected they would be allowed to increase their property tax levies. So, that was not a cut, but it did curtail how much additional money school districts could raise on their own.\nOn actual state funding of schools, Walker did cut about $784 million with his first state budget. But he has been adding back funding with each of his subsequent budgets, to the tune of about $1 billion in total.\n\nMitchell\u2019s statement contains an element of truth, but mixes apples and oranges and ignores facts that would give a different impression. Our rating is Mostly False.\n Share the Facts 2018-08-01 11:41:37 UTC   PolitiFact    3 1 7  PolitiFact \u5224\u5b9a: Mostly False  Says Scott Walker \"has cut more from public education than he's put back in, obviously.
