He sees Hispanic unemployment at the lowest it\u2019s been in the history of our country. He sees (women\u2019s unemployment) the lowest it\u2019s been in now almost 19 years.\"\nTrump has previously made claims of this sort, but it\u2019s been a few months, so we thought we\u2019d take a new look at the numbers.\nAfrican-American unemployment\nIn March 2018, the African-American unemployment rate stood at 6.9 percent. That\u2019s not a record low, but it\u2019s close \u2014 and the record low was 6.8 percent in December 2017, also on Trump\u2019s watch.\nHere\u2019s the full data for the black unemployment rate since the statistic was first calculated in 1972:\n\nHispanic unemployment\nThe Hispanic unemployment rate was 5.1 percent in March 2018. That\u2019s not a record either, but once again, it\u2019s close.\nThe Hispanic unemployment rate was as low as 4.8 percent three times in 2017, in June, October and November. Those low points all occurred on Trump\u2019s watch.\nHere\u2019s the full historical data:\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Boysko\n\n\nstated on January 18, 2021 in a committee debate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe United States is the only industrialized, modernized country that does not already have a paid family medical leave program in place.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 28, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWomen\u2019s unemployment\nCurrently, the unemployment rate for women is 4.0 percent. It was slightly lower during an earlier point in Trump\u2019s presidency \u2014 3.9 percent in October 2017.\nThe women\u2019s unemployment rate was lower still in December 2000, when it hit 3.8 percent. That falls within the 19-year windowTrump cited.\nHere\u2019s the full run of data:\n\nSome additional context\nEconomists agree that presidents don\u2019t deserve either full credit or full blame for the unemployment rate on their watch. The president is not all-powerful on economic matters; broader factors, from the business cycle to changes in technology to demographic shifts, play major roles.\nAnd to the extent that a president does deserve credit for low unemployment, Trump\u2019s predecessor, Barack Obama, deserves at least as much as Trump does.\nAs these charts show, the unemployment rate for blacks, Hispanics, and women declined dramatically on Obama\u2019s watch as the country pulled out of the Great Recession.\nBlack unemployment peaked at 16.6 percent in April 2010, when Obama was president. It then fell by more than half to 7.8 percent by the time Obama left office in January 2017.\nHispanic unemployment, meanwhile, peaked at 13 percent in August 2009, then fell to 5.9 percent at the end of Obama\u2019s term in January 2017.\nAnd unemployment among women peaked at 9 percent in November 2010, before falling to 4.8 percent by the time he left office in January 2017, a drop of nearly half.\nOur ruling\nTrump said, \"Kanye looks and he sees black unemployment at the lowest it\u2019s been in the history of our country. He sees Hispanic unemployment at the lowest it\u2019s been in the history of our country. He sees (women\u2019s unemployment) the lowest it\u2019s been in now almost 19 years.\"\nThe unemployment rates for African-Americans and Hispanics have hit all-time lows in recent months on Trump\u2019s watch, and the rate for women was recently the lowest it\u2019s been in more than 18 years. But it\u2019s worth remembering that,to the extent that presidents deserve any credit for economic conditions on their watch, the heavy lifting in getting rates that low occurred before Trump became president.\nWe rate the statement Mostly True.\n Share the Facts 2018-04-26 18:33:16 UTC   PolitiFact    5 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly True  \"Kanye (West) looks and he sees black unemployment at the lowest it\u2019s been in the history of our country.
