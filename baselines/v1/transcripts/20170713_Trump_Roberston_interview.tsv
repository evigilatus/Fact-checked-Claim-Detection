0001	Pat Robertson	Mr. President, I am so glad to see you.
0002	Pat Robertson	I'm so proud of everything you're doing.
0003	Donald Trump	Thank you.
0004	Pat Robertson	Let me ask you.
0005	Pat Robertson	You have just gotten back from the G20.
0006	Pat Robertson	You were traveling around the world.
0007	Pat Robertson	What do you see as the major problem facing the world today?
0008	Pat Robertson	What's the major issue?
0009	Donald Trump	Well we have many problems.
0010	Donald Trump	And I was left a very, very tough meal.
0011	Donald Trump	I will say that.
0012	Donald Trump	It was a mess.
0013	Donald Trump	And I think we're doing very well.
0014	Donald Trump	But North Korea certainly is a big problem.
0015	Donald Trump	The Middle East is a total mess.
0016	Donald Trump	Other than in five months we have done more against ISIS than anybody has done since the beginning.
0017	Donald Trump	And we're having tremendous success with that.
0018	Donald Trump	But I would have to say, Middle East is a tough situation.
0019	Donald Trump	But we're getting it straightened out.
0020	Donald Trump	And ultimately, we want to start investing money back in the United States at our home.
0021	Donald Trump	Yeah.
0022	Donald Trump	But we have to get rid of ISIS.
0023	Donald Trump	We have to get rid of the terrorists, as you know better than anybody.
0024	Donald Trump	And the other is North Korea.
0025	Donald Trump	We have somebody that is  we will find out what he is.
0026	Donald Trump	We're going to find out.
0027	Pat Robertson	He has launched intercontinental missiles.
0028	Pat Robertson	Is there a possibility that we might want to knock some of those down on the launch pad or right after launch?
0029	Donald Trump	Well, we wouldn't want to be speaking about anything.
0030	Donald Trump	But we're looking at lots of different ways.
0031	Donald Trump	We're working with other countries, including China.
0032	Donald Trump	I think China would like to see this problem go away.
0033	Donald Trump	It's a big problem for them.
0034	Donald Trump	And, you know, the advantage we have is trade.
0035	Donald Trump	We have big trade with China.
0036	Donald Trump	And I have a very good relationship with President Xi, who I like a lot.
0037	Donald Trump	And I think he likes me.
0038	Donald Trump	We were just spending a lot of time together.
0039	Donald Trump	And they are very strong with regard to, as you know, with regard to North Korea.
0040	Pat Robertson	Will they get tough with North Korea?
0041	Pat Robertson	I know that you were so close when he was there visiting MaraLago.
0042	Donald Trump	Well, we're going to see.
0043	Donald Trump	We're going to see.
0044	Donald Trump	I would say that we had a good chance.
0045	Donald Trump	They had an election where President Moon got elected to South Korea.
0046	Donald Trump	He has a much different attitude  or a much different take  on how to handle this situation than his predecessor in South Korea.
0047	Donald Trump	He's perhaps softer on the issue, but maybe not, because I like him a lot.
0048	Donald Trump	I think he's going to be a strong person.
0049	Donald Trump	I think he's got strong views  stronger than people would understand.
0050	Donald Trump	So we'll see how it all works out.
0051	Donald Trump	I think China wants to help us.
0052	Donald Trump	We're going to find out whether or not they do.
0053	Donald Trump	But China would, in my opinion, like to be able to help us.
0054	Pat Robertson	What's our leverage with them?
0055	Donald Trump	Well, our leverage with China is that China makes hundreds of billions of dollars a year with us on trade.
0056	Donald Trump	And I want to renegotiate trade deals.
0057	Donald Trump	But I would certainly be a lot easier in a trade deal if they were going to help us with North Korea than if they weren't.
0058	Donald Trump	So we're going to see.
0059	Donald Trump	The relationship is very good with China.
0060	Donald Trump	It's very good with the president of China, who's a terrific person.
0061	Donald Trump	We will find out whether or not they want to help.
0062	Donald Trump	And maybe they do.
0063	Donald Trump	And maybe they don't.
0064	Pat Robertson	What about that consortium of Arab nations that went against Qatar.
0065	Pat Robertson	Your secretary of state was not too favorable to what was being done.
0066	Pat Robertson	How are we going to handle that one?
0067	Donald Trump	Well, Rex is doing a terrific job.
0068	Donald Trump	But he and I had a little bit of a difference, only in terms of tone.
0069	Donald Trump	So we went to Saudi Arabia.
0070	Donald Trump	We had one of the great meetings ever  54 Muslim countries.
0071	Donald Trump	And I got up, made a speech, got nice reviews.
0072	Donald Trump	It's almost like you making a speech.
0073	Donald Trump	But I said, we've got to stop the funding of terrorism.
0074	Donald Trump	Tremendous money, and they're funding terrorism.
0075	Donald Trump	So we've got to stop it.
0076	Donald Trump	So they are working very hard on that.
0077	Donald Trump	And I believe they're going to do it.
0078	Donald Trump	It was one of the most incredible two days.
0079	Donald Trump	As an example, Saudi Arabia put up hundreds of billions of dollars of money going into buying our planes and our military equipment and investing in our country.
0080	Donald Trump	And I said, you have to do that.
0081	Donald Trump	Otherwise I'm not going.
0082	Donald Trump	So they spent hundreds of billions of dollars right in front of us.
0083	Donald Trump	They were signing and big people from the biggest countries in companies  General Electric, and all of the big companies.
0084	Donald Trump	Many of them were there getting contracts.
0085	Donald Trump	All good work for our workers.
0086	Donald Trump	That was one of the things.
0087	Donald Trump	But the other thing is that  and very important to me  was the funding of terrorism has to stop.
0088	Donald Trump	And they fund terrorism  some of those countries, many of those countries.
0089	Donald Trump	So we had a tremendous summit.
0090	Donald Trump	And I think things are going to work out.
0091	Donald Trump	I think it was a very, very important and very impressive two days.
0092	Donald Trump	And now, as you know, Qatar  which a lot of people call it Qatar  but Qatar is now a little bit on the outs.
0093	Donald Trump	But I think they are being brought back in.
0094	Donald Trump	Because they were known as a funder of terrorism.
0095	Donald Trump	And we said you can't do that.
0096	Donald Trump	You can't do that.
0097	Donald Trump	We have to starve the beast, right.
0098	Donald Trump	And the beast is terrorism.
0099	Donald Trump	So we can't have wealthy countries funding that beast.
0100	Pat Robertson	How do we handle that big military installation we built in Qatar?
0101	Pat Robertson	What do we do with that?
0102	Donald Trump	Well, we'll be all right.
0103	Donald Trump	Look, if we ever had to leave, we would have 10 countries willing to build us another one.
0104	Donald Trump	Believe me.
0105	Donald Trump	And they'll pay for it.
0106	Donald Trump	The days of us paying for things are going to be largely over.
0107	Donald Trump	They'll start paying.
0108	Donald Trump	We go out.
0109	Donald Trump	We build.
0110	Donald Trump	We this.
0111	Donald Trump	We that.
0112	Donald Trump	But you're right.
0113	Donald Trump	Qatar  we're going to have a good relationship with Qatar.
0114	Donald Trump	And we're not going have a problem with the military base.
0115	Donald Trump	But if we ever needed another military base, you have other countries that would gladly build it.
0116	Donald Trump	Believe me.
0117	Pat Robertson	You went to the G20.
0118	Pat Robertson	And you met for the first time, front face to face, with Vladimir Putin.
0119	Pat Robertson	And George Bush had once said he stared into his soul and came away satisfied.
0120	Pat Robertson	What do you think?
0121	Pat Robertson	Can we trust him?
0122	Donald Trump	Well, look, we had a good meeting.
0123	Donald Trump	I think we had an excellent meeting.
0124	Donald Trump	One thing we did is we have a ceasefire in a major part of Syria where there was tremendous bedlam and tremendous killing.
0125	Donald Trump	And by the way, this is now four days.
0126	Donald Trump	The ceasefire has held for four days.
0127	Donald Trump	Those cease fires haven't held at all.
0128	Donald Trump	That's because President Putin and President Trump made the deal and it's held.
0129	Donald Trump	Now, I don't know what's going to happen.
0130	Donald Trump	Maybe as we're speaking they start shooting again.
0131	Donald Trump	But this has held, unlike all of the other cease fires that didn't mean anything.
0132	Donald Trump	So that was a great thing that came out of that meeting.
0133	Donald Trump	I think a lot of things came out of that meeting.
0134	Donald Trump	But I do believe it's important to have a dialogue.
0135	Donald Trump	And if you don't have a dialogue, it's a lot of problems for our country and for their country.
0136	Donald Trump	I think we need dialogue.
0137	Donald Trump	We need dialogue with everybody.
0138	Donald Trump	Sure.
0139	Donald Trump	It was a great G20.
0140	Donald Trump	We had 20 countries.
0141	Donald Trump	I get along, I think, really fantastically with the head of every country.
0142	Pat Robertson	Well, you're going to France right away to meet with Macron.
0143	Pat Robertson	And you were there for Bastille Day instead of July the Fourth, that's their special holiday.
0144	Donald Trump	That's right.
0145	Donald Trump	Well I was invited by the president  the new president of France  who is a very good person, very good guy.
0146	Donald Trump	And don't forget, I terminated for our country the Paris Accord.
0147	Donald Trump	So that's not that easy for them.
0148	Donald Trump	But I terminated it, because it was not fair to our country.
0149	Donald Trump	We have other countries that had much better deals than we did, to put it just in a very simple form.
0150	Donald Trump	And I said, why do we not have a better deal?
0151	Donald Trump	And nobody could give me the answer.
0152	Donald Trump	I said, I'm terminating.
0153	Donald Trump	So I terminated.
0154	Donald Trump	But I'm going to be with the president.
0155	Donald Trump	And I think it's going to be very exciting.
0156	Donald Trump	It's 100 years since World War I.
0157	Donald Trump	Turns out to be the exact date.
0158	Donald Trump	So we're going to watch something that I think will be very beautiful.
0159	Donald Trump	And I think it's very important for our country to be represented 100 years since the First World War.
0160	Pat Robertson	Lafayette, we are here.
0161	Pat Robertson	We've come back.
0162	Pat Robertson	Here we are.
0163	Pat Robertson	Here we are.
0164	Pat Robertson	Oh that's great.
0165	Pat Robertson	Well back to Putin.
0166	Pat Robertson	What do you think he wants?
0167	Pat Robertson	I know he's said what he wants.
0168	Pat Robertson	But what do you think his game is?
0169	Donald Trump	Well he wants what's good for Russia.
0170	Donald Trump	Yeah.
0171	Donald Trump	And I want what's good for the United States.
0172	Donald Trump	And I think, like in a case like Syria, where we can get together, do a cease fire  and there are other cases or many other cases where getting along can be a very positive thing.
0173	Donald Trump	But always, Putin is going to want Russia.
0174	Donald Trump	And Trump is going to want United States.
0175	Donald Trump	And that's the way it is.
0176	Donald Trump	And sometimes, you're not going to get along on things.
0177	Donald Trump	And sometimes you will.
0178	Donald Trump	But we had a good meeting.
0179	Donald Trump	It was a face to face meeting.
0180	Donald Trump	It was a long meeting.
0181	Donald Trump	It was two hours and 15 minutes.
0182	Donald Trump	Everyone were surprised by the amount of time.
0183	Donald Trump	But that was a good thing, not a bad thing.
0184	Pat Robertson	Sure.
0185	Donald Trump	Yeah, I think we got along very well.
0186	Donald Trump	And I think that's a good thing.
0187	Donald Trump	And that's not a bad thing.
0188	Donald Trump	Yeah, of course not.
0189	Donald Trump	People said, oh they shouldn't get along.
0190	Donald Trump	Well, who are the people that are saying that?
0191	Donald Trump	I think we got along very, very well.
0192	Donald Trump	We're a tremendously powerful nuclear power.
0193	Donald Trump	And so are they.
0194	Donald Trump	Sure It doesn't make sense not to have some kind of a relationship.
0195	Pat Robertson	We used to have that thing called mutually assured destruction  MAD.
0196	Pat Robertson	And it's still there.
0197	Pat Robertson	Because he can hurt us.
0198	Pat Robertson	He can decimate our country.
0199	Pat Robertson	And we can do the same thing to him.
0200	Donald Trump	It's something you don't even like talking about.
0201	Donald Trump	But again, we're the most powerful country in the world.
0202	Donald Trump	And we are getting more and more powerful.
0203	Donald Trump	Because I'm a big military person.
0204	Donald Trump	As an example, if Hillary had won, our military would be decimated.
0205	Donald Trump	Our energy would be much more expensive.
0206	Donald Trump	That's what Putin doesn't like about me.
0207	Donald Trump	And that's why I say, why would he want me?
0208	Donald Trump	Because from day one, I wanted a strong military.
0209	Donald Trump	He doesn't want to see that.
0210	Donald Trump	And from day one, I want fracking and everything else to get energy prices low and to create tremendous energy.
0211	Donald Trump	We're going to be selfsupporting.
0212	Donald Trump	We just about are now.
0213	Donald Trump	We're going to be exporting energy.
0214	Donald Trump	He doesn't want that.
0215	Donald Trump	He would like Hillary, where she wants to have windmills.
0216	Donald Trump	He would much rather have that, because energy prices will go up.
0217	Donald Trump	And Russia, as you know, relies very much on energy.
0218	Donald Trump	There are many things that I do that are the exact opposite of what he would want.
0219	Donald Trump	So when I keep hearing about that he would have rather had Trump, I think probably not.
0220	Donald Trump	Because when I want a strong military, you know she wouldn't have spent the money on the military.
0221	Donald Trump	But when I want a strong military, and when I want tremendous energy, we're opening up coal.
0222	Donald Trump	We're opening up natural gas.
0223	Donald Trump	We're opening up fracking  all the things that he would hate.
0224	Donald Trump	But nobody ever mentions it.
0225	Pat Robertson	Well, Gazprom held Europe by the throat.
0226	Pat Robertson	They were the monopoly.
0227	Pat Robertson	And now the US is breaking into that monopoly with our exports of LNG, right?
0228	Donald Trump	Right.
0229	Donald Trump	We are.
0230	Donald Trump	We have LNG exporting all over.
0231	Donald Trump	We have taken off some of the regulations that would make it impossible for the energy companies, impossible for banks, impossible for a lot of different things.
0232	Donald Trump	You couldn't build a house in some places.
0233	Donald Trump	And many of those restrictions have been taken off.
0234	Donald Trump	Some are being taken off.
0235	Donald Trump	We have statutory waits, meaning you have to wait a certain period of time.
0236	Donald Trump	And the country is doing really well.
0237	Donald Trump	So the stock market is the highest it's ever been.
0238	Donald Trump	We have almost $4 trillion in gain.
0239	Donald Trump	$4 trillion, I hope you're taking advantage of that.
0240	Donald Trump	We have four  almost $4 trillion 
0241	Pat Robertson	I'm into the bargain 
0242	Pat Robertson	But when you think of that, that's creating value.
0243	Pat Robertson	We have a lot of tremendous things ready to go, tremendous projects all over the country.
0244	Pat Robertson	Don't forget, when I came in, one of my first acts was the Keystone Pipeline.
0245	Pat Robertson	Yeah.
0246	Donald Trump	And the Dakota Access Pipeline.
0247	Donald Trump	These two things got approved immediately.
0248	Donald Trump	They would have never been built.
0249	Donald Trump	And it's thousands and thousands of jobs.
0250	Donald Trump	And it was my honor.
0251	Donald Trump	To me, it was a nobrainer.
0252	Pat Robertson	The regulatory burden on American business has been, really, worse than taxes.
0253	Pat Robertson	And you have lifted  how many regulations have you lifted so far?
0254	Donald Trump	Oh, just thousands.
0255	Donald Trump	And what we've done is we've given the farmers back their land.
0256	Donald Trump	We've given the homebuilders the right to put up a house.
0257	Donald Trump	You had cases where a farm would have a little puddle someplace  a puddle.
0258	Donald Trump	When I grew up, we used to call it a puddle, right  you too, probably.
0259	Donald Trump	And they considered it a lake.
0260	Donald Trump	And if you touched it, bad, bad things happen to you and your family.
0261	Donald Trump	We've given the farmers back their farms.
0262	Donald Trump	We have so many things planned in the future too, with the tax cuts and the death taxes.
0263	Donald Trump	We're ending the death taxes.
0264	Donald Trump	There's so many things we have planned.
0265	Donald Trump	But the farmers are so happy now.
0266	Donald Trump	The homebuilders are happy.
0267	Donald Trump	We have our most jobs ever in our country.
0268	Donald Trump	Now we have to take care of those people that have given up looking for a job.
0269	Donald Trump	You have a large group of people in this country that have given up.
0270	Donald Trump	I would talk about them a lot in speeches.
0271	Donald Trump	They've given up looking for jobs.
0272	Donald Trump	They're going to be looking very soon.
0273	Donald Trump	And they're going to be getting those jobs.
0274	Pat Robertson	I was talking to Mike Pence a few minutes ago.
0275	Pat Robertson	And he thinks that possibly that health care bill can go through.
0276	Pat Robertson	There are two pieces of legislation that the American people are really anxious to see put through.
0277	Pat Robertson	One is this iniquitous Obamacare has got to go and be replaced.
0278	Pat Robertson	Number two, we've got to have a tax cut, especially for small businesses  corporate tax.
0279	Pat Robertson	How far along are you?
0280	Donald Trump	And number three is infrastructure, which we're going to do also.
0281	Pat Robertson	Exactly.
0282	Donald Trump	But number one, repeal and replace.
0283	Donald Trump	I am sitting in the Oval Office with a pen in hand, waiting for our senators to give it to me.
0284	Donald Trump	For years, they've been talking about repeal and replace, repeal and replace.
0285	Donald Trump	I think they passed it 61 times  repeal and replace.
0286	Donald Trump	But that didn't mean anything.
0287	Donald Trump	Because you had the minority, the Republicans.
0288	Donald Trump	They didn't have the majority, so it wasn't going to get to the president.
0289	Donald Trump	But if it ever did, Obama was going to sign it, so it didn't mean.
0290	Donald Trump	Now, we have a president that's waiting to sign it.
0291	Donald Trump	I have pen in hand.
0292	Donald Trump	So now it means something.
0293	Donald Trump	Those other times  those many, many times that they passed it 
0294	Pat Robertson	What's the hold up?
0295	Donald Trump	You have very good people.
0296	Donald Trump	These are very good people.
0297	Donald Trump	We have 52 senators.
0298	Donald Trump	It's very hard to get all  we need almost all of them.
0299	Donald Trump	You need almost all of them.
0300	Donald Trump	And that's the holdup.
0301	Donald Trump	And states are somewhat different.
0302	Donald Trump	But with all of that being said, has to get passed.
0303	Donald Trump	They have to do it.
0304	Donald Trump	They have to get together and get it done.
0305	Pat Robertson	What will happen if they don't?
0306	Donald Trump	Well, I don't want to talk about it.
0307	Donald Trump	Because I think it would be very bad.
0308	Donald Trump	I would be very angry about it.
0309	Donald Trump	And a lot of people will be very upset.
0310	Donald Trump	But I'm sitting waiting for that bill to come to my desk.
0311	Donald Trump	I hope that they do it.
0312	Donald Trump	They've been promising it for years.
0313	Donald Trump	They've been promising it ever since Obamacare, which has failed.
0314	Donald Trump	It's a failed experiment.
0315	Donald Trump	It is totally gone.
0316	Donald Trump	It's out of business.
0317	Donald Trump	And we have to get this done  repeal and replace.
0318	Pat Robertson	Mitch McConnell is a tactician of great skill.
0319	Pat Robertson	You think he can pull it off?
0320	Pat Robertson	It's his job.
0321	Donald Trump	He's got to pull it off.
0322	Pat Robertson	Yeah.
0323	Donald Trump	Mitch has to pull it off.
0324	Donald Trump	He's working very hard.
0325	Donald Trump	He's got to pull it off.
0326	Pat Robertson	All right, the next thing is taxes.
0327	Pat Robertson	It looks like to me, lowering the corporate tax to get us in line with the rest of the world is, again, a nobrainer.
0328	Pat Robertson	Can you get that one through?
0329	Donald Trump	I think after health care, taxes are going to be so easy.
0330	Donald Trump	Health care is very hard.
0331	Donald Trump	Health care is hard, because you'll do something a little bit this way, and you pick up that final vote, and you lose four votes over here.
0332	Donald Trump	Now you it back.
0333	Donald Trump	It's a very tiny little road.
0334	Donald Trump	It's about two feet wide.
0335	Donald Trump	And it goes throughout the country.
0336	Donald Trump	So health care is much tougher than taxes.
0337	Donald Trump	No, I think taxes are going to be very well.
0338	Donald Trump	In fact, our plan is we're talking about massive tax cuts  the biggest tax cut in the history of our country.
0339	Donald Trump	We're going to get people back again.
0340	Donald Trump	We're going to bring back $4 trillion from overseas.
0341	Donald Trump	Money that can't come back into this country because of our tax code.
0342	Donald Trump	We're going to bring back $4 trillion  could be more than that  from corporations that can't get their money back into our country.
0343	Donald Trump	We're going to give a tremendous tax cut for the middle class.
0344	Donald Trump	We're bringing it down to 10%.
0345	Donald Trump	We're bringing corporate taxes down to 15%.
0346	Donald Trump	I hope we can get that number approved.
0347	Donald Trump	Maybe they'll want to do something and negotiate.
0348	Donald Trump	But if we get what we want, it will be the biggest tax cut and the greatest tax reform in the history of our country.
0349	Pat Robertson	Would you settle for the tax cut without reforming the whole tax code?
0350	Pat Robertson	Or would you like to work with the whole thing?
0351	Donald Trump	Well, I think we can do them simultaneously.
0352	Donald Trump	The code is too complicated.
0353	Donald Trump	HR Block won't be happy.
0354	Donald Trump	But people go out.
0355	Donald Trump	They spend a lot of their money on getting other people to do their taxes.
0356	Pat Robertson	I'm one of them.
0357	Donald Trump	I know.
0358	Donald Trump	You understand.
0359	Donald Trump	And it's unnecessary.
0360	Donald Trump	So simplification is very important.
0361	Donald Trump	Reform is very important.
0362	Donald Trump	And the biggest thing to me is tax cut.
0363	Donald Trump	We are going for very large tax cuts for businesses and for the middle class.
0364	Donald Trump	Tremendous tax cuts.
0365	Pat Robertson	Chairman Brady is on board with what you want to do.
0366	Pat Robertson	He's a great guy.
0367	Pat Robertson	He will line up.
0368	Pat Robertson	Have you got anybody in the Senate of like mind?
0369	Donald Trump	Well first of all, Chairman Brady is a great guy.
0370	Donald Trump	He really knows the subject.
0371	Donald Trump	He'll never disappoint you.
0372	Donald Trump	So they're, I think, really good.
0373	Donald Trump	In the Senate, I think we're going to do very well.
0374	Donald Trump	Again, like health care  this is simpler than health care, believe it or not  but like health care, I think we're going to get it done.
0375	Donald Trump	And then I want to go to infrastructure.
0376	Donald Trump	We have to rebuild our country  our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our schools.
0377	Donald Trump	We have to rebuild our country.
0378	Pat Robertson	Exactly.
0379	Donald Trump	You know, we will have, in another few months, have spent $7 trillion dollars in the Middle East.
0380	Donald Trump	$7 trillion.
0381	Donald Trump	And then if you want to spend $2 on building a school in Iowa or in Pennsylvania or in Florida, they don't want to give you the money.
0382	Donald Trump	But we've spent  in a very short period of time  we will be up to $7 trillion dollars.
0383	Donald Trump	How ridiculous is this?
0384	Donald Trump	And here's what we got for it.
0385	Donald Trump	Nothing.
0386	Donald Trump	Nothing.
0387	Donald Trump	The Middle East is a mess.
0388	Donald Trump	Now, I'm there for one reason.
0389	Donald Trump	We've got to get rid of the terrorists.
0390	Donald Trump	That's the reason.
0391	Donald Trump	And we're almost there.
0392	Donald Trump	We have really made headway.
0393	Donald Trump	We've made, as I said, we've made more headway in the last short period of time than they have ever before, by far, during this long period of time.
0394	Donald Trump	But when you think that we've spent  we will have spent $7 trillion.
0395	Donald Trump	Think of it.
0396	Donald Trump	We've spent, as of a few months ago, we actually have spent $6 trillion in the Middle East.
0397	Donald Trump	But we have nothing for it.
0398	Donald Trump	Nothing.
0399	Donald Trump	I want to rebuild our bridges and our roads.
0400	Donald Trump	I have a friend who's a trucker.
0401	Donald Trump	And he loves  he's very proud of his equipment.
0402	Donald Trump	He buys it very big.
0403	Donald Trump	And he buys the best trucks.
0404	Donald Trump	He's very proud of it.
0405	Donald Trump	He said in the past, when we went from Los Angeles to New York, it was fine.
0406	Donald Trump	Now by the time he gets to New York, with all the problems on the roads and potholes, he said I've got to fix my equipment all the time.
0407	Donald Trump	He wants to go to a different level of truck, meaning downward.
0408	Pat Robertson	Where do you go 
0409	Donald Trump	We have to fix our roads.
0410	Donald Trump	And we have to fix our infrastructure.
0411	Donald Trump	So infrastructure is very important.
0412	Pat Robertson	Somebody suggested the Federal Reserve has a big slush fund that maybe they could pass over for infrastructure without actually having to raise taxes.
0413	Pat Robertson	How do you get the money for that?
0414	Donald Trump	Oh, we'll get the money.
0415	Donald Trump	We're going to get the money.
0416	Donald Trump	And we're going to grow.
0417	Donald Trump	And I say it.
0418	Donald Trump	We're going to grow.
0419	Donald Trump	We're going to have tremendous growth.
0420	Donald Trump	We're being held back by all these regulations, which I'm knocking out left and right.
0421	Pat Robertson	Yeah.
0422	Donald Trump	Even DoddFrank, with the banking business.
0423	Donald Trump	I have people  friends of mine  they want to go get a loan.
0424	Donald Trump	They can't.
0425	Donald Trump	Great people, and they can't get loans.
0426	Donald Trump	We're doing things on DoddFrank, in terms of the banks.
0427	Donald Trump	We have many, many things that we're doing.
0428	Donald Trump	But we're going to have growth.
0429	Donald Trump	And we're going to grow out of our problems.
0430	Donald Trump	Hey, we owe $20 trillion dollars.
0431	Pat Robertson	The Congressional Budget Office uses this.
0432	Pat Robertson	They don't use dynamic scoring.
0433	Pat Robertson	They use static scoring.
0434	Pat Robertson	Can you get past them so you can 
0435	Donald Trump	We're going to get past it.
0436	Donald Trump	And we're going to get past it to a large extent, because we're going to have a country that's going to be much more dynamic.
0437	Donald Trump	If we do GDP at 1%  because we're basically, for the last year, at around 1%.
0438	Donald Trump	I call countries like I'm friendly with all  let's say, the top 20 countries where I just left.
0439	Donald Trump	How are you doing to a major country  I won't use names  oh, we are not happy.
0440	Donald Trump	We are not happy.
0441	Donald Trump	What's your GDP?
0442	Donald Trump	8%.
0443	Donald Trump	11%.
0444	Donald Trump	10%.
0445	Donald Trump	9%.
0446	Donald Trump	And I say, how you doing?
0447	Donald Trump	We are not happy.
0448	Donald Trump	So we're at 1% and we're supposed to be happy?
0449	Donald Trump	We have the highest taxes anywhere in the world.
0450	Donald Trump	We're going to lower them.
0451	Donald Trump	We're going to lower them substantially.
0452	Donald Trump	We're going to have tremendous growth.
0453	Pat Robertson	I'd like to make a prediction.
0454	Pat Robertson	If you get health care and tax reform, you're guaranteed another four years of office if you want it.
0455	Donald Trump	Well then I'll see you at the inauguration.
0456	Pat Robertson	I am counting on it.
0457	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
0458	Pat Robertson	Anyhow, well, I appreciate so much what you're doing.
0459	Pat Robertson	By the way, the evangelicals of America voted 83% in the last election for you.
0460	Pat Robertson	And I want you to know there are thousands and thousands of people praying for you all the time.
0461	Donald Trump	Thank you Pat, that's so nice.
0462	Pat Robertson	Holding you up.
0463	Donald Trump	The evangelicals were so great to me.
0464	Donald Trump	And they did.
0465	Donald Trump	They came out in massive numbers.
0466	Donald Trump	And on top of that, I got 83%.
0467	Donald Trump	But they came out in record numbers.
0468	Donald Trump	They never came out like that.
0469	Donald Trump	And we've really helped.
0470	Donald Trump	Because I've gotten rid of the Johnson Amendment.
0471	Donald Trump	Now we're going to go try and get rid of it permanently in Congress.
0472	Donald Trump	But I signed an executive order so that now, people like you  that I want to hear from  ministers and preachers and rabbis and whoever it may be, they can speak.
0473	Pat Robertson	Yeah.
0474	Donald Trump	You couldn't speak politically before.
0475	Donald Trump	Now you can.
0476	Donald Trump	And I want to hear from you and others that we like.
0477	Donald Trump	Franklin Graham  I had such a  Dr. Jeffress, Robert Jeffress, who is such a great guy.
0478	Donald Trump	Pastor Jeffress.
0479	Donald Trump	He used to go on television.
0480	Donald Trump	I didn't know who he was.
0481	Donald Trump	I'd see him.
0482	Donald Trump	And he was always speaking so well of me.
0483	Donald Trump	And you have so many people that I want to hear from.
0484	Donald Trump	Now they're going to be able to speak.
0485	Donald Trump	And that's going to be a great thing for Christianity.
0486	Donald Trump	Believe me  a great, great thing.
0487	Donald Trump	And it's a great thing for religion.
0488	Pat Robertson	One last thing.
0489	Pat Robertson	It looks like you may have another Supreme Court nominee.
0490	Pat Robertson	Very possible one or more will retire.
0491	Pat Robertson	And have you already got the list ready for the next one?
0492	Donald Trump	Well we have a great one with Justice Gorsuch.
0493	Donald Trump	Unbelievable.
0494	Donald Trump	He's going to be great.
0495	Donald Trump	And I just have to wait to see what happens.
0496	Donald Trump	I have a lot of respect for Justice Kennedy.
0497	Donald Trump	I like him a lot.
0498	Donald Trump	But we have to see what happens.
0499	Donald Trump	And we'll be learning.
0500	Donald Trump	Whatever it is, it is.
0501	Donald Trump	If there is ever a vacancy, we will put somebody on who is going to be terrific for our country.
0502	Pat Robertson	Last question.
0503	Pat Robertson	There seems to be a visceral hatred of you in the part of the left.
0504	Pat Robertson	And they won't quit.
0505	Pat Robertson	Does it bother you?
0506	Donald Trump	Well, there's a  there seems to be a hatred.
0507	Donald Trump	And it's too bad.
0508	Donald Trump	We're creating jobs.
0509	Donald Trump	We're creating value.
0510	Donald Trump	We're making our country proud again.
0511	Donald Trump	We're building up our military.
0512	Donald Trump	We're taking care of our police.
0513	Donald Trump	Our police have been horribly treated.
0514	Pat Robertson	And the veterans, by the way, is being reformed dramatically.
0515	Donald Trump	The veterans.
0516	Donald Trump	We have something where it's accountability.
0517	Donald Trump	Veterans Accountability Act.
0518	Donald Trump	We have, where you could be the worst employee in history, you could treat the veterans horribly.
0519	Donald Trump	You can do whatever you want.
0520	Donald Trump	They couldn't fire you.
0521	Donald Trump	They've been trying to get rid of it for 40 years.
0522	Donald Trump	They've been trying to get in a position where they can do things.
0523	Donald Trump	I had it passed last week.
0524	Donald Trump	I just signed it last week.
0525	Donald Trump	Nobody even talks about it.
0526	Donald Trump	But you know what?
0527	Donald Trump	The people know that we're doing these things.
0528	Donald Trump	The people see the stock market.
0529	Donald Trump	The people see the jobs report.
0530	Donald Trump	But it is really unfair, because it's like a witch hunt.
0531	Donald Trump	It's like a witch hunt.
0532	Donald Trump	But we take it.
0533	Donald Trump	We take it.
0534	Donald Trump	As long as my people understand  that's why I do interviews with you.
0535	Donald Trump	You have a tremendous audience.
0536	Donald Trump	You have people that I love  the evangelicals.
0537	Donald Trump	And sometimes, you say the evangelical Christians.
0538	Donald Trump	But I do a lot of interviews with people, because I can get the word out.
0539	Donald Trump	Because I'm treated very unfairly by the press.
0540	Donald Trump	And it is what it is.
0541	Pat Robertson	You don't mind if we ask you to take on heavyweights and not fight and with light weights anymore?
0542	Donald Trump	No, we want to fight.
0543	Donald Trump	The big guys.
0544	Donald Trump	We want to fight.
0545	Donald Trump	We have to bring our country back.
0546	Pat Robertson	Yeah.
0547	Donald Trump	Our country was going in the wrong direction.
0548	Donald Trump	That's right.
0549	Donald Trump	You couldn't build.
0550	Donald Trump	You couldn't do anything.
0551	Donald Trump	Our country was going in the wrong direction.
0552	Donald Trump	And by the way, what they were doing to religious liberty.
0553	Donald Trump	They were destroying religious liberty.
0554	Donald Trump	You will be saying Merry Christmas again very soon.
0555	Pat Robertson	We'll count on it.
0556	Donald Trump	Thank you.
0557	Pat Robertson	Well, Mr. President, thank you so much for being with us.
0558	Donald Trump	Thank you.
0559	Pat Robertson	Always a joy to see you.
0560	Donald Trump	Such a great honor.
0561	Pat Robertson	We're so proud of what you're doing.
0562	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.
0563	Pat Robertson	God bless you.
