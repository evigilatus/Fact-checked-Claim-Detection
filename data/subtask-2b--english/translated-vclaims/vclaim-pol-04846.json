The emotionally charged announcement focuses on a couple from Ohio, Chris and Lauren Glaros, talking about raising their daughter, Grace, who was born with spine defects. \"When I saw Donald Trump mocking a disabled person, I was shocked,\" says Lauren Glaros in the Declaration, produced by the priority American Labour Organization. Last fall, Trump was widely criticized for being physically simulating the reporter of The New York Times Serge Kovalski at a campaign rally in South Carolina on 24 November. Kovalski has arthropods, a congenital condition that limits the movement of his arthropods. The ad shows a picture of her right hand texting that's so attached to the wrist. The ad's cutting Trump's video in the race. \"You've got to see this guy,\" says Trump, knocking through his arms, his right hand flopping in a strange corner while yelling in a strange, agitating voice: \"Oh, I don't know what I said! Oh, I don't remember!\" \"When I saw Donald Trump mocking a disabled person, he showed me his soul, showed me his heart. Nor did Father Chris Glaros like what I saw. The television commercial (which you can see completely in the bottom of the fact-finding) is broadcast in seven critical states -- Colorado, Ohio, Nevada, Virginia, Florida, New Hampshire, Iowa. In fact, the Polyte Fruit case checks out the obvious truth: did Trump mock the man's incapacitation? But first, we want to separate Trump's irony from reality. Kovalski is a Pulitzer-winning investigative journalist who speaks with a normal voice and doesn't wave his arms. A video witness of Kovalski reporting on his leading report on the murders of a former national star in New England, Aaron Hernandez. \"Clinton made a false announcement about me, where I was following the lead of Grofling's journalist after he changed his story. I'm never gonna make fun of people with disabilities. What a shame! The Trump campaign did not respond to Poletti Fuckett &apos; s request for comment. Polyte Fact also contacted Kovalski, who refused to comment. This is why Trump singled out this journalist. At the time of the November gathering, Trump was hot because of his widely dismantled allegations in Jersey City, N.J., where \"thousands and thousands of people were shouting\" about the collapse of the World Trade Center following the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001. To defend this story, Trump took over a story from September 18, 2001, by Kovalski - who then worked in the Washington Post - and another journalist. Near the bottom of the story, they wrote that \"law enforcement authorities have arrested and questioned a number of people who were allegedly seen celebrating attacks and throwing parties on rooftops while watching destruction on the other side of the river.\" However, journalists were unable to verify the celebrations that had already taken place. \"I certainly don't remember anyone saying that thousands or even hundreds of people were celebrating. This wasn't the case, as far as I can remember, \"Kovalyski later said Washington post-fact checks. Remember, Kovalski wrote that \"a number of people\" - not thousands - claim that they are testifying. That's why Trump thinks Kovalski was backing out of the 2001 story drunk on his impersonation, \"Ah, I don't remember!\" Trump's behavior has provoked public anger. The New York Times disproved Trump in a statement: \"We think it's outrageous that he's gonna make fun of the appearance of one of our reporters.\" Colleagues and friends defended Kovalski. Facebook was published on January 13, 2021 in a Facebook photo showing the Republic. Lauren Boibert with troublemakers in the Capitol before giving them a tour of the building \"one day before the rebellion.\" By Samantha Buterman: 14 January 2021 \"@sergenyt is one of the best journalists - the best people - I know. This is a vile, \"ESPN reporter and author Don Van Nata Jr. Books on Twitter. The people who share Kovalski in a case -- officially known as the multi-congenita Arthur Griboss -- and their families launched the social media campaign with the AMCStrong. Tramp denied making fun of the journalist's disability. \"I'm just simulating what I thought would be a volatile journalist trying to get out of a statement he made a long time ago,\" he said in a statement at the time. \"I don't believe it. He was obviously mocking his disability, \"Julie Reskin, Executive Director of the Colorado Global Disability Alliance, an advocacy group, said when we asked her about it. \"That was very clear, because it disagrees with all kinds of people at other times, and does not use that voice and does not wave its arms like this.\" Ryskin confirmed that she was just giving her opinion on Trump's behavior because her non-profit group couldn't support or oppose any candidate. Ryskin said that the Trump Society offered \"screaming to persons with disabilities as unqualified persons. If you can't control your speech or part of your body that you're not qualified, which is very destructive\" of the image of the disabled who face stereotypes and discrimination, you add. United States Senator Mark Kirk, a Republican from Illinois, recently withdrew his support for Trump after Trump said that a federal judge of Mexican origin born in Indiana was unable to preside fairly over a collective lawsuit against Trump and the University of Trump, which no longer existed. But Kirk also referred to Trump's comments. Kirk suffered a serious stroke in 2012 and uses a wheelchair after years of rehabilitation. Kirk said: \"In the context of past attacks on Hispanics, women and the disabled like me, Donald Trump's recent statements make it certain that I cannot and will not support my party candidate for the presidency.\" During the rally reaction, Trump insisted in a statement that he did not know the man was disabled because \"I have no idea who this journalist is, Serge Kovalski, or how he looks or how smart he is. Although there's always one great memory I certainly don't remember.\" Kovalski responded as a reporter for the New York Daily News in the late 1980s and early 1990s, regularly covering Trump. He told Washington Post that he was sure the businessman remembered him -- and his condition. \"Donald and I were based on the first name for years,\" said Kovalsky The New York Times. In fact, Kovelski remembered spending the day with Trump in 1989, when a journalist and other journalists travelled with a billionaire on a \"opening trip\" to Trump's shuttle. \"We got out of LaGuardia, we spent a big part of the day flying up and down the east coast with Trump talking to me and the others on the plane,\" said Kovalski Daily News. The angry Trump called the next day and yelled at him \"because Kovalski had stated that Trump took off late on his first flight after Trump ran several commercials and said that it would be the largest airline in time in the industry. The story of Daily News, which looks at the history of Kovalski with Trump, included an archive of the story of Wings of Don, with a picture of Trump cutting a celebratory tape. In addition, Trump used to talk about Kovelsky at the rally, and he called him a \"cute reporter.\" He also described him as the \"poor man\" and pointed out that he knew Kovalski's appearance (\"you must see this man\") before he began his tradition. However, the candidate repeatedly denied the knowledge of the journalist. \"Serge Kovalski must think a lot of himself if he thinks I remember him decades ago -- if I ever met him at all, that's what I doubt. He must stop using his handicap in Grandstand and report back on the paper that's going fast down the pipes, \"Trump said, get a shot in The New York Times, in a statement. In an announcement from \"The Importance of the United States of America,\" the parents of a child with a trump \"signed\" a reporter with a disability in a campaign rally. The great hand of his trust in his faithful life has been restored to Christians who are Christian Christians. The disabled and the lawyers said the candidate was making fun of him. Tramp's excuses for his comments run counter to the evidence. Trump said he didn't even remember the guy he didn't even know he was disabled. But Kovalski said that he and Trump knew each other well because the reporter had been regularly covering the New York businessman for years. The archived reports support this. Trump also talked about a reporter who had knowledge of a \"nice reporter\" and a \"poor man\" who \"should see it.\" \u2219 Tramp denied that he was not mocking or even knowing the disabled reporter. We are assessing the claim of the declaration correctly. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/b6a6f3b2-11b8-443e-a384-f9791cd9b28b", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04846"}
