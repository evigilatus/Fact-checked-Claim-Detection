Similar headlines appeared on several other links that users questioned.\nThe post claimed that while the \"liberal media\" is attacking President Donald Trump\u2019s response to the humanitarian crisis, the real issue is that \"the Teamsters Union drivers did not show up to work. Only 20 percent of drivers arrived at the ports to distribute the relief supplies,\" The Gateway Pundit said.\nThe other posts all shared the same sentiment, and often included \"proof\" from more social media posts claiming to know all about the problem.\nBut they aren\u2019t right to blame union truckers for the lack of movement. It turns out the blog posts are delivering misinformation about this problem.\nSites are picking and choosing details\nThe Gateway Pundit pointed to another Sept. 30 post from TheConservativeTreehouse.com, which cited a Sept. 29 Huffington Post interview with U.S. Air Force Col. Michael A. Valle. Valle was born in Puerto Rico and was leading Maria relief efforts.\nThe Conservative Treehouse post included a passage from the interview that said supplies are being sent to Puerto Rico, but not being moved across the island.\n\"It\u2019s a lack of drivers for the transport trucks, the 18 wheelers,\" the website quoted Valle as saying. \"Supplies we have. Trucks we have. There are ships full of supplies, backed up in the ports, waiting to have a vehicle to unload into. However, only 20 percent of the truck drivers show up to work. These are private citizens in Puerto Rico, paid by companies that are contracted by the government.\"\nValle did say in the Huffington Post interview that there was a lack of drivers, but he also went on to add the drivers deserved \"zero blame:\"\n\"They can\u2019t get to work, the infrastructure is destroyed, they can\u2019t get fuel themselves, and they can\u2019t call us for help because there\u2019s no communication. The will of the people of Puerto Rico is off the charts. The truck drivers have families to take care of, many of them have no food or water. They have to take care of their family\u2019s needs before they go off to work, and once they do go, they can\u2019t call home.\"\nThe Conservative Treehouse also posted a video of CNBC\u2019s Contessa Brewer reporting from San Juan as proof of the problem, but ignored the part where Brewer said transportation problems are not the drivers\u2019 fault.\n\"You\u2019re looking at truck drivers who can\u2019t be reached by their businesses by cell phone, they don\u2019t have the gas to get to work, and then even when they do get to work, their semi-trucks don\u2019t have fuel,\" Brewer said. \"The problem is the supply chain.\"\nShe added that Crowley Puerto Rico, a shipping and logistics company, said that getting drivers to the port and back out again was proving to be a challenge.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere has been a definite problem moving supplies that have arrived. On Sept. 29, the same day Valle\u2019s interview was published, the Teamsters sent out a press release asking union truck drivers to volunteer to go to Puerto Rico to help transport supplies. The release warned that it wouldn\u2019t be easy, but fellow union workers needed help.\n\"At this time, it is unclear if there are trucks available to move the containers, fuel to operate the trucks or road access to the distribution centers,\" the release read. \"However, the labor movement is working on the ground in Puerto Rico to bring volunteers to meet specific needs.\"\nThere\u2019s no mention of strike in the press release, and nothing in Valle\u2019s interview about labor unions, so where did the The Conservative Treehouse\u00a0get that? From an interview with a trucker not affiliated with the Teamsters union.\nThe blog turned to a Spanish-language interview for Lo S\u00e9 Todo on Wapa.tv with Victor Rodriguez, identifying as \"the boss of a very sketchy (corrupt and violent) Puerto Rico trucker\u2019s union called Fente Amplio.\"\nDozens of subsequent posts online identify Frente Amplio (note the different spelling) as the local Teamsters union, which Teamsters spokesman Galen Munroe told us is incorrect. Rodriguez represents the independent Frente Amplio de Camioneros de Puerto Rico (Broad Front of Truck Drivers of Puerto Rico), which is not affiliated with the Teamsters. \u00a0\nTheConservativeTreehouse.com egregiously misrepresented Rodriguez\u2019s interview, translating it to claim that Rodriguez said truck drivers are refusing to work as part of a plan to show up Puerto Rico\u2019s governor.\n\"Since the country doesn\u2019t care about truckers, the truckers won\u2019t help,\" TheConservativeTreehouse.com quoted Rodriguez. It credits the reporter with getting Rodriguez to admit his defiance.\n\nIn truth, Rodriguez is saying the opposite, that despite a disagreement over a law signed by Puerto Rican Gov. Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 concerning truck permitting, drivers should help in any way they can. Truckers called off a planned strike because of Hurricane Irma three weeks prior, he said.\nRodriguez did take a swipe at Rossell\u00f3, saying long lines are partly his fault, and noted that truckers can\u2019t come down when they are in regions with impassable roads. But by and large, Rodriguez said that truckers are working and doing what they need to do to deliver goods. He even cuts off the reporter at one point for suggesting they are refusing to work.\nIn response to all the false stories online blaming Teamster drivers, the union released a statement on Oct. 2 that said their members have been working since Maria passed over the island. The statement blamed \"online, anti-union sources\" for spreading an inaccurate story.\n\"These viral stories spreading across the internet are nothing but lies perpetrated by anti-union entities to further their destructive agenda,\" Teamsters president Jim Hoffa said in the release. \"The fact that they are attempting to capitalize on the suffering of millions of citizens in Puerto Rico that are (in) dire need of our help by pushing these false stories, just exposes their true nature.\"\nOur ruling\nBloggers said that \"San Juan Teamsters didn't show up for work to distribute relief supplies\" because they went on strike after Hurricane Maria.\nThe widespread accusations trace back to a post that selectively edited and mistranslated interviews to make it look like union truckers were being greedy and lazy.\nBut there\u2019s no strike, and union truck drivers have been trying to move aid shipments across Puerto Rico. There are multiple logistical problems slowing down transport, not the least of which is that some drivers simply can\u2019t get to the port, or drive on impassable roads.\nBloggers are misrepresenting a real humanitarian crisis by blaming trade unions.
