Considering that tea party voters helped fuel a huge Republican victory in New Hampshire legislative races in 2010, Buckley\u2019s statement, if true, would indicate a rather abrupt change of heart.\n\nAsked for backup for Buckley\u2019s claim, New Hampshire Democratic Party spokeswoman Holly Shulman cited a New Hampshire Tea Party website that strongly endorses legislation that would weaken unions\u2019 clout by preventing them from collecting dues or fees from nonmembers covered by union contracts. She also cited polls by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center that show strong support for the right to collectively bargain.\n\nThere is no doubt that the New Hampshire Tea Party Coalition news release for a May 25, 2011, rally identifies the \"right to work\" bill as \"the most important piece of legislation for the future health of the New Hampshire economy that will be considered in this session or any other session.\"\n\nAnd Romney, does, indeed, support \"right-to-work\" laws, and has specifically spoken in favor of the GOP bill in Concord, which would end a practice allowing union contracts to include a clause requiring non-union workers to pay a share of collective bargaining costs.\n\nNew Hampshire Gov. John Lynch, a Democrat, vetoed the bill, and supporters have been unable to muster an override.\n\nBut there are two major issues with Buckley\u2019s claim: First, it suggests that two-thirds of New Hampshire voters oppose the tea party, not just its agenda on labor issues. \u00a0And secondly, it distorts what is known about public opinion on the union issue.\n\nPolls show Buckley is correct in saying the tea party doesn\u2019t represent \"the majority\" of Granite Staters, but to suggest that two-thirds oppose the group is a big stretch.\n\nUNH Survey Center director Andrew Smith said his group\u2019s most recent poll, in July 2011, showed that 27 percent of New Hampshire adults supported the tea party, 35 percent were opposed, and 38 percent were neutral or said they didn\u2019t know.\n\n\"This has been pretty consistent for the past year,\" he said by e-mail.\n\nShulman also referred PolitiFact to a New York Times/CBS News poll on Aug. 5, 2011, and wrote, \"Recent national polls show the tea party is very unpopular.\" That national poll, incidentally, found 20 percent of Americans with a favorable view of the tea party, 40 percent unfavorable, and 39 percent saying they were either undecided or hadn\u2019t heard enough about the group.\n\nBut Smith told us that opinion on the tea party in New Hampshire tracks closely along political affiliation -- support among Republicans, opposition among Democrats, and mixed opinion among independents, with more than 50 percent of them neutral about the group.\n\n\"I can see what (the Democrats) are trying to do, but I don\u2019t think that saying that two-thirds of people in New Hampshire oppose the tea party accurately reflects public opinion,\" Smith said.\n\nHe also takes some exception with how Buckley\u2019s team is characterizing the polling data on unions. The UNH Survey Center poll in May, which Democrats cited, asked respondents whether public- and private-sector workers should have the right to form unions and negotiate pay and benefits.\n\nAnd, indeed, there is support for unionization on that front in both sectors. Sixty-six percent of respondents said workers should have the right to unionize, with only 20 percent opposed, and the numbers for government workers, specifically, weren\u2019t much different.\n\nBut Smith said his polling specifically avoided using \"right to work,\" which refers to laws outlawing compulsory dues paying. \u00a0\n\nUsing the phrase \"right to work,\" Smith said, \"doesn\u2019t accurately reflect\" what his poll question asked.\n\nOur ruling\n\nBuckley said \"Two-thirds of Granite Staters oppose the Tea Party\" and its agenda on labor unions.\n\nBut UNH polls show the opposition to the tea party is about 35 percent, about half as much as Buckley says.\n\nAnd while New Hampshire voters support the right to form unions and negotiate, the polls Democrats cite don\u2019t ask about the also contentious issue of compulsory union dues.
