The short answer is in some cases, but some recent social media articles mischaracterize this battle against flattening and oversimplify it. The Facebook site co-produced a cow with a red bag tied to its back and said, \"I wish this was a joke, but the marginal leftists are now calling for cow windbags to pick up the wind as a way to help prevent \"global warming.\" The article was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The picture used in the article is real and was taken in 2008 in Argentina by a photographer, Reuters Marcus Berndice. However, researchers from the National Institute of Agricultural Technology used the soft plastic tank to collect cow burp to study the impact of its food on methane production. It was published on January 25, 2021 in a video that says Bill Gates \"at least 3 billion people must die\" from this planet. \u2022 On January 27, 2012, therefore, while the bags in the picture are certainly related to combating climate change, they were not attached to eliminating the emissions of the bovine methane from the atmosphere, but rather to study the cow's digestive system and measure the effect of its emission. Then in 2013, the same researchers used the bags as a collection system to convert and convert methane into renewable biofuels. In the report of the Institute, Ricardo Bualo, a project technician, said that purified and compressed biomethane could be used to generate calories, light energy and kinetic energy: \"The cow sends about 300 litres of methane per day, which can be used to operate a 100-litre refrigerator at a temperature of two to six degrees per day.\" According to EPA, human activities are responsible for almost every increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere over the past 150 years. In 2017, about 9% of US emissions came from the agricultural sector, according to the Agency. So, yes, scientists stick cow backpacks to collect their gas - burp, not cavity - and turn it into renewable energy in an attempt to disrupt animal-launched methane levels. But the Facebook article does not explain any details of studies, including methane conversion, and wrongly links scientists and researchers as \"left fring.\" The article contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that give a different impression. We mostly rate it wrong.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00357"}
