Dino Rossi,\" the voiceover in the ad says. \"Rossi first showed up in Olympia decades ago. He went to work! Health care stripped from 45,000 children.\"\nThey\u2019re referencing a 2003 budget measure, back when Rossi was the state Senate Ways and Means chairman.\nThe budget was looking bleak, so Republicans proposed large spending cuts that year. One, proposed by Rossi, was a $50 million cut in Medicaid spending. The cut would have eliminated coverage for nearly 40,000 low-income children, according to reporting at the time.\nBut the cut didn\u2019t fly with Democrats, and ended up being scrapped in the final budget. The final budget, which won bipartisan support, wasn't a specific cut, but it did include rules changes. Those changes\u00a0ultimately resulted in the loss of coverage for 45,000 kids on Medicaid.\nWhile it didn\u2019t change any of the eligibility requirements, the budget changed state Medicaid policy in a way that lead to an enrollment decline later reported by state health care agencies. We were unable to trace this measure back to Rossi himself, but he did vote in its favor.\nFirst, it ended continuous eligibility, which meant if a family\u2019s income was over the income standard, the child\u2019s medical coverage would end. Second, certification periods went from every 12 to every six months. A signature became necessary for renewal, ending telephone renewals. Third, it adopted new income verification requirements; while it previously accepted a family\u2019s statements, it now verified the information provided through available databases.\n\"These changes were requested by the legislature and they did have the impact of reducing the children\u2019s caseload by at least 45,000,\" said Amy Blondin, chief communications officer for the Washington State Health Care Authority.\nAndrew Bell, spokesman for Dino Rossi, said the changes Rossi pushed forward in the budget ensured resources were given to the neediest families.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

The 2003 Washington state Senate budget measure he voted for increased administrative hurdles for children seeking Medicaid coverage. Most of the eligible children regained coverage when the rules changed back in 2005.\nWe rate this statement Mostly True.\n Share the Facts 2018-09-18 14:55:38 UTC   PolitiFact    5 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly True  Says Dino Rossi \"stripped\" health care \"from 45,000 children.\"    House Majority PAC Democratic PAC https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weSBOyPPAJk   In an ad Wednesday, September 12, 2018 2018-09-12    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01603"}
