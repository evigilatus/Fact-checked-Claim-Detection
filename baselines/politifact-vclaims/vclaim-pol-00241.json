Dan Bishop of Mecklenburg County. The district is Republican-leaning, but the race is considered close leading up to the Sept. 10 election.\nMcCready recently put health care coverage at the forefront of his campaign, highlighting legislation Bishop sponsored as an example of how the Republican would fail to protect North Carolinians.\n\"Sen. Dan Bishop doubles down on removing coverage for people with pre-existing conditions,\" McCready tweeted on Aug. 8, adding \"Under (Bishop\u2019s) sham \u2018association health plans,\u2019 insurance companies don\u2019t have to pay for medications for pre-existing conditions.\"\nWhat is McCready talking about? His tweet provided a link to a Winston-Salem Journal story about the Small Business Health Care Act, also known as Senate Bill 86. The bill was recently passed by the legislature and sent to Gov. Roy Cooper for approval.\nWe looked into the details of the bill and found McCready has a point about insurers being able to offer skimpy coverage as part of the proposed new health plans, but his claim about \"removing coverage\" for people is an exaggeration.\nWhat are association health plans?\nAt the federal level, Bishop has stated that he wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, which protects people with pre-existing conditions. Bishop has said he wants to replace it with something better.\nAt the state level, Bishop sponsored SB 86. The bill aims to provide coverage for small businesses, trade associations and other groups of professionals who are in the same industry or line of work through what\u2019s called an \"association health plan.\" President Donald Trump in 2017 signed an executive order expanding the availability of these plans as a way of providing an alternative option who can\u2019t afford ACA plans.\nPeople who work for associations and other small businesses sometimes can\u2019t offer their employees insurance because they struggle to find plans that are affordable. This bill would enable insurers to offer coverage plans to these groups that might be cheaper than ACA plans because they\u2019re not required to provide as much coverage.\nBishop\u2019s bill explicitly states that association health plans would be subject to the ACA\u2019s \"group health plan\" requirements, which means insurers \"cannot deny individuals coverage if they have preexisting conditions, cannot impose annual and lifetime limits on certain benefits, and must provide free access to certain preventative services.\"\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean that people with pre-existing conditions would be guaranteed coverage for services they need.\n\u2018Essential benefits\u2019\nThere\u2019s more than one way to deny coverage to people, said Valerie Lewis, an associate professor of health policy and management at UNC\u2019s Gillings School of Global Public Health. Allowing insurers to discriminate at the time of enrollment is just one way, she said.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJenna Wadsworth\n\n\nstated on January 26, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth Carolina Secretary of State Elaine Marshall \"has won more statewide races than probably anyone else alive.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Paul Specht \u2022 February 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The other way is to allow anyone to join or purchase the plan, but to have the plan provide a very limited set of benefits,\" she said in an email.\nThat\u2019s what health policy experts say could happen under Bishop\u2019s bill. While the ACA requires plans to cover 10 \"essential benefits\" \u2014 from prescription drugs and rehabilitative services to chronic disease management \u2014 association plans are subject to looser standards and aren\u2019t required to cover those essential benefits, she said.\n\"As a simple example, you could allow people who have cancer to buy into the plan, but the plan might cover (pay for) zero cancer care \u2014 in effect removing coverage for the preexisting condition despite nominally allowing the person to purchase the insurance plan,\" Lewis said.\nThe Winston-Salem Journal story points out that Bishop\u2019s bill \"does not include guarantees of the essential benefits. An amendment to add the essential benefits to SB86 was tabled by a 28-20 vote in the Senate,\" with Bishop voting to table it.\nUnder the version the legislature sent to the governor, \"employers could still choose between AHPs with somewhat more limited coverage and normal group insurance that has full coverage,\" said Mark Hall, Director of Health Law and Policy at Wake Forest University\u2019s School of Law.\n\"So no group would be denied the option of full coverage,\" Hall said, emphasizing the word \"option.\" But, people within a group could, and probably would, end up with less coverage for some of their pre-existing conditions.\"\nOther potential problems\nAfter a year of insuring a group or association, an insurer could \"identify people whose claims are high\" and write the following year\u2019s coverage plan to exclude their needs, said David Anderson, a research associate at Duke University\u2019s Margolis Center for Health Policy.\nIndeed, an association plan \"can be shaped so that it doesn\u2019t attract people with certain conditions,\" said Kevin Lucia, a research professor at the Center on Health Insurance Reforms for Georgetown University\u2019s McCourt School of Public Policy.\nBut it\u2019s also possible insurers craft plans in order to attract people, Hughes Waren, a leader of the NC Association of Health Underwriters, told North Carolina Health News. If the associations include high-income workers, he said the associations may be incentivized to seek plans with decent benefits.\n\"I would have no reason to think that anybody is doing these to offer skinny plans. It\u2019s really to provide a benefit to their members,\" Waren told NC Health News. \"They\u2019re going to create competitive plans that are attractive.\"\nThere\u2019s one more factor to consider. If healthy people leave their ACA plan for an association health plan, people with ACA plans could face higher premiums the following years because there won\u2019t be as many people to share the cost burden. Customers with pre-existing conditions are likely to be the most affected.\nOur ruling\nMcCready said Bishop supported \"removing coverage for people with pre-existing conditions.\"\nThat wording could give the impression that this bill directly and immediately strips health care coverage from people with pre-existing conditions. That\u2019s not the case.\nBut experts point out that insurers aren\u2019t required to offer association health plans with a full range of services for people with pre-existing conditions. The proliferation of association health plans could also affect people with pre-existing conditions on ACA plans. McCready\u2019s claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.
