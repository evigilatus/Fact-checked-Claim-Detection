Jean Schmidt says 32 of every 33 pregnant women who visit Planned Parenthood get abortions", "text": "Soon after taking control of the House of Representatives, Republicans opened a new front in the abortion war by attempting to block Planned Parenthood from receiving any federal money.\n\nFederal law already prohibits tax dollars from paying for abortions, but Republicans argue that the $363 million that Planned Parenthood gets each year for Title X family planning services actually subsidizes abortions indirectly because money is fungible.\n\nThe April 14 measure that would have stripped federal funds from Planned Parenthood passed the House by a 241-185 margin but failed in a 42-58 U.S. Senate vote.\n\nDuring debate over the bill, Democrats portrayed Planned Parenthood clinics as a major provider of many types of health services to low income women, while Republicans claimed that Planned Parenthood steers pregnant women into getting abortions.\n\n\"For every 33 pregnant women that walk into a Planned Parenthood clinic, 32 receive an abortion,\" Rep. Jean Schmidt, a Cincinnati-area Republican, said in a speech in the House of Representatives.\n\nThat ratio got PolitiFact Ohio\u2019s attention. So we asked her office where the numbers came from.\n\nSchmidt was president of Right-to-Life of Greater Cincinnati before she was elected to Congress and currently chairs the House Pro-Life Women\u2019s Caucus. She referred us to reports produced by several anti-abortion organizations, including Americans United for Life, Concerned Women for America, Liberty Counsel Action, Family Research Council Action, and the Chiaroscuro Foundation.\n\nAll stated that roughly 98 percent of Planned Parenthood\u2019s services to pregnant women consist of abortion. They derived their information from a March 2011 fact sheet from Planned Parenthood. That fact sheet says the group performed 332,278 abortions in 2009, referred 977 patients to other agencies for adoptions, and provided prenatal care to 7,021 patients.\n\nThe anti-abortion groups came up with the 98 percent figure by comparing the number of abortions to the number of procedures in the other two categories. Schmidt\u2019s 32 out of 33 statistic works out to 97 percent - the approximate percentage her sources provided.\n\nBut there are problems with that calculation.\n\nFirst, it assumes that pregnant women only go to Planned Parenthood for one of those three options.\n\nPlanned Parenthood representatives say that interpretation overstates the ratio of abortions among its pregnant clients. It ignores other statistics, such as the 1,158,924 pregnancy tests the group provided, and the fact that those 332,278 abortions were just 3 percent of the 11,383,900 total procedures that Planned Parenthood health centers provided that year to its 3 million patients.\n\nThirty five percent of its services consisted of providing contraception and another 35 percent consisted of testing for sexually transmitted diseases and treatment.\n\nThe fact sheet stats also don\u2019t reflect the fact that only a tiny proportion of Planned Parenthood centers around the country provide prenatal care - just 63 out of more than 800, said Tait Sye, a spokesman for the organization. Those that don\u2019t offer prenatal care refer pregnant women to other health care providers for those services, and Planned Parenthood doesn\u2019t keep track of those referrals. And the 7,021 figure for prenatal clients that was used in the calculations doesn\u2019t include pregnant women who went to Planned Parenthood for prenatal care and were sent to outside obstetricians.\n\nThe group doesn\u2019t \"ask the pregnancy status of every woman that walks into Planned Parenthood,\" and plenty of pregnant women use the organization for other services, like breast exams, Sye said. \u00a0Consequently, he says it\u2019s \"impossible to calculate an accurate percentage if you don\u2019t know the total number of pregnant women it is based on.\"\n\nIn an emailed statement, Planned Parenthood Vice President for Communications Stuart Schear called Schmidt\u2019s assertion \"a meaningless and unverifiable statistic since Planned Parenthood does not collect information on the pregnancy status of every female patient who comes into our health centers.\"\n\nWhen Schmidt was asked about the points made by Planned Parenthood\u2019s spokesmen, she said the group \"obfuscates the truth by comparing apples to oranges \u2013 or services to patients.\"\n\n\"They say 90 percent of the services they provide are preventative, but more than 10 percent of their patients are provided an abortion,\" Schmidt said in an email. \"They say they don't know the number of pregnant women they serve. It shouldn't be that hard to figure out. Whether a patient is pregnant or not should be one of the first questions they ask.\" \u00a0\n\nSchmidt is correct that women of childbearing age are routinely asked whether they might be pregnant when they visit a doctor\u2019s office. Sye acknowledged that Planned Parenthood\u2019s intake form contains a question that asks whether female patients are pregnant. \"But, we don\u2019t tally the number of women we see every year who are pregnant or not pregnant,\" he said.\n\nPolitiFact recently fact checked a statement Sen. John Kyl made about Planned Parenthood. In that item we noted a few caveats that are worth repeating.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nFirst, we think many people would acknowledge a difference between providing an abortion and, say, handing out a pack of condoms or conducting a blood test. The former is a significant surgical procedure, whereas the latter are quick and inexpensive services. So Planned Parenthood\u2019s use of \"services\" as its yardstick likely decreases abortion\u2019s prominence compared to what other measurements would show. Using dollars spent or hours devoted to patient care would likely put abortion above 3 percent in the calculations. So Schmidt does have a point about citing services, rather than patient numbers.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nSecond, it\u2019s worth noting that Planned Parenthood self-reported these numbers, although the group says each affiliate\u2019s numbers are independently audited. (There is no single, national audit.) So we have no choice but to accept their accuracy more or less on faith.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWhat certainly is true is that without knowing the total number of pregnant women that Planned Parenthood sees, it is impossible to compute an accurate ratio for how many of them get abortions.\n\nPolitiFact places the burden of proof on the speaker. In this case, Schmidt cannot meet that burden because information needed for that showing is unknown.\n\nAnti-abortion groups and Schmidt can try to fill the information vacuum by using Planned Parenthood\u2019s incomplete data to come up with their own number. \u00a0But that doesn\u2019t mean that their number is correct.\n\nThe fact sheet shows that Planned Parenthood does a sizable number of abortions. But the ratio she cites (97 percent) is extreme.\n\nSye noted that just 63 out of more than 800 Planned Parenthood centers provide their own prenatal care. That means that pregnant women seeking prenatal care from more than 700 centers would be referred to outside providers.\n\nWomen seeking prenatal care are not likely to be seeking an abortion, and none of those women are included in the totals cited by Schmidt\u2019s sources.\n\nSchmidt\u2019s claim also overlooks that pregnant women who \"walk into\" a clinic could be there for any reason, not just for pregnancy-related services.\n\nOn the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Schmidt\u2019s statement False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSherrod Brown\n\n\nstated on November 30, 2010 in an MSNBC interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Understand, this is unemployment insurance.
