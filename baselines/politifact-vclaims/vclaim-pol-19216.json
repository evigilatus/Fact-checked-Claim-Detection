Rep. Maxine Waters didn\u2019t say Trump supporters \u2018not welcome here\u2019", "text": "In the final days of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, a 2018 social media post resurfaced featuring one of Trump\u2019s sharpest critics, California Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters.\nThe post shows two images of Waters, each overlaid with a quote attributed to her.\nThe first: \"We\u2019re sending a message to every Trump supporting American that you\u2019re not welcome here.\" The second: \"We must welcome everyone who crosses our borders, whether they are illegal or not.\"\nA caption next to the image, which was shared 44,000 times, captures the irony of the supposed quotes: \"So actual Americans are unwelcome but illegals are welcome? Thanks for clearing that up.\"\nHowever, neither quote is accurate. And while Waters did make statements suggesting Trump Cabinet members should be singled out in public, she did not direct her comments at Trump supporters broadly, as this post suggests.\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nIn searches of Google and Nexis news archives, we found no evidence that Waters had uttered either quote.\u00a0\nBut the post appears to allude to the Trump administration\u2019s zero-tolerance policy on immigration, announced in April 2018. The policy led to the separation of nearly 3,000 children from their parents when families tried to enter the United States at the Mexico border without permission.\nWaters\u2019 Trump comment\nWe did find that on June 23, 2018, Waters made comments about Trump\u2019s Cabinet members during a rally in Los Angeles. During the event, she demanded that children separated at the border be reunited with their parents.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin Nunes\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in an interview on Fox\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRepublicans have no way to communicate\u201d after tech companies cut off Parler.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Amy Sherman \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHer comments came one day after the owner of a restaurant in Lexington, Va., refused to serve then-White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and asked her to leave, saying Sanders works in an \"inhumane and unethical\" administration.\nWaters said at the rally:\n\"We want the children back. We want them connected to their parents. We want it done now. We\u2019re going to insist on it. If you think we\u2019re rallying now, you ain\u2019t seen nothing yet. Already you have members of your Cabinet that are being booed out of restaurants, who are \u2014 protesters taking up at their house, who are saying, \u2018no peace, no sleep; no peace, no sleep.\u2019\"\nShe added:\u00a0\n\"And so, let\u2019s stay the course. Let\u2019s make sure we show up, wherever we have to show up. And if you see anybody from that Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd and you push back on them and you tell them they\u2019re not welcome anymore, anywhere. We\u2019ve got to get the children connected to their parents.\"\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post says Waters said Trump supporters are \"not welcome here\" and that \"we must welcome everyone who crosses our borders.\"\u00a0\nNeither quote is accurate.\nWaters did say that members of Trump\u2019s Cabinet are \"not welcome anymore, anywhere\" in a June 2018 critique of the administration\u2019s zero-tolerance immigration policy, one that led to the separation of children from their parents at the Mexico border. But she did not direct her comments at all Trump supporters as this post suggests.\nWe rate this post Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19216"}
