We saw this again after a proper assessment of a very narrow and specific allegation by the Government. Scott Walker that Wisconsin is leading another 11 states in the Middle West in the growth of personal income over the one-year period that ended with the first quarter of 2014. Soon after Walker blew up the news, readers and Internet bloggers were competing for this picture not too bright if more of Walker's state was considered. What if I check out Walker's entire administration? In his comments of 14 August 2014, the reader and the recurrent commentator, Jim Spice, asked on JS Online.com and Facebook. His conclusion is: \"I downloaded the data set from the P.A. web site, and I ran the numbers using 2010 Q4 as a starting point, and, oh, what do you know? WI DAD LAST is classified in income growth among those 12 states!\" Others made similar allegations, including a blog on Liberal Daily Kos. Are they right? We started with data from the Federal Bureau for Economic Analysis, the same source that Walker used. Data calculate wages, income of property and government assistance as \"personal income.\" We smashed the numbers using that starting point at the end of 2010, in the last quarter before Walker took over from the democratic government. Jim Doyle. The endpoint was the first quarter of 2014, the last quarter for which data were available. First, there is no \"Meadowest\" category in the Agency's geographical distribution. Two areas used by the Agency include states that are often associated as peers in the Midwest of Badger State. One is the Great Lakes region (Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio). The other area is Plains: Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota. Here's what we found: the growth of the State's personal income since the fourth quarter of 2010 ranked among the 50 states of North Dakota 32.81% 1 iowa 15.70% 10 Nebraska 15.23% 11% south Dakota 13.53% 18 Ohio 13.42% 19 Kansas Verification of facts In fact, white women have gained employment.\" Compared to the recent period in Doyle, which coincided with the Great Recession, Wisconsin ranked seventh in the 12 states and ranked twenty-sixth at the national level, the highest point of the average of the United States. When we asked the Bureau of Economic Analysis whether the starting point for 2010 was logical to judge 2011 and move forward, the spokesman for Thomas Dale said that it was correct to use the fourth quarter of 2010 as a baseline. This allows for comparison of the pre-Walker income level with the first full year of Walker &apos; s office, 2011 and beyond, as he said. We asked three experts to study the figures for the International Bar Association. Bryan Jacobsen, Chief Strategic Officer, Wales Fargo Fund Management; Laura Drazer, Business Economist and Assistant Director, Wisconsin Strategy Centre; and Dale Knap, Research Director, Payers Alliance, Wisconsin. All three warned that comparing quarters could lead to distortions - we noted that the last quarter before Walker saw an unusually large leap in personal income. This is partly due to the early shift in Medicaid payments to that quarter, the Walker campaign correctly indicates. The statistical impact is a larger starting point for Walker, which means that any gains on his watch seem smaller than they might be. Another defensible starting point is the first quarter of 2011, our experts said, which takes the first three months of Walker &apos; s life. But this distorts the other way because Medicaid's payments -- after they were transferred earlier -- seem much less. Using this baseline, Wisconsin's growth was the second best in the Middle West. The Walker campaign does not dispute the use of the 2011 rule. They prefer, and our experts, to look at annual growth rates that mitigate the fluctuations you see in quarterly data. From 2010 to 2013, we found Wisconsin ranked ninth in 12 western states. There is no doubt that anomalies occur in large numbers from time to time because of government policies. In his claim \"We No. 1,\" Walker went backwards one year from the last quarter to the quarter that witnessed the largest loss of one quarter of personal income in three years. This, of course, made the state look better in the comparison it chose. The loss was due in part to the \"Washington financial fee legislation,\" which helped to artificially increase income in late 2012, leading to a personal income recession in the one-year Walker base quarter. In this case, both Walker and his critics chose to compare quarterly figures rather than annual rates. Walker could have chosen an annual comparison - from 2012 to 2013 - the most recent one with a full calendar year available. But by this scale, Wisconsin is in the middle of the growth group. Our experts said that there is no one right way. \"I think it's quite honest and accurate to say that income grew by 10.9 per cent from the last quarter of 2010 to the first quarter of 2014,\" said Jacobson, referring to the comparison that was last seen in the Middle West. Our assessment after Walker correctly pointed out that personal income growth was the best in the Midwest last year, commentators claimed that Wisconsin was \"the last dead in income growth\" during government. (Scott Walker) Three more years in office. Quarterly figures put Wisconsin at the bottom, based on the starting point approved by the agency that collected the information. \u25cf Respect any future comparison that will help us to learn about Christians. However, according to the figures, the allegation of blogs is on target. We're assessing it right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07382"}
