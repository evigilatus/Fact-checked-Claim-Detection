One about birth control.\nHis campaign pointed us to criticism from the\u00a0U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops\u00a0of a Jan. 20 decision that \"ordered almost every employer and insurer in the country to provide sterilization and contraceptives, including some abortion-inducing drugs, in their health plans,\" according to the group.\n\nThe bishops said \"almost every employer and insurer.\"\n\nWe wondered, was Gingrich right that the Obama administration \"would impose on every Catholic institution, every Jewish institution, every Protestant institution the Obamacare standard of what you have to buy as insurance\"?\n\n'The Obamacare standard'\n\nThe rule Gingrich was talking about, announced by Health and Human Services Department Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, addressed which preventive services must be covered by insurers without a co-pay, co-insurance or a deductible paid by the recipient of medical care.\n\nWe should mention: There's not a clear \"Obamacare standard of what you have to buy as insurance.\" The law provides for co-pay-free preventive care, which is what Sebelius clarified Jan. 20. And for individual and small-group plans, the law requires that policies cover \"essential health benefits.\" They must include services in 10 categories, but the details have been left to the states.\n\nThe idea of co-pay-free preventive care stems from studies that show that even moderate co-pays\u00a0kept women from getting care, such as mammograms or pap smears, according to HHS. The nongovernmental\u00a0Institute of Medicine\u00a0recommended that preventive services include \"all FDA-approved forms of contraception.\" So that's what HHS decided to include in its final rule about preventive services.\n\nMost health insurance plans will have to cover them without a co-pay, co-insurance or a deductible. For most new and renewed health plans, that requirement kicks in Aug. 1, 2012.\nReligious exemptions\n\nNotice we said that \"most\" health insurance plans will have to offer co-pay-free preventive care. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops said \"almost every employer and insurer.\"\n\nGingrich said, \"every Catholic institution, every Jewish institution, every Protestant institution.\"\n\nBut the rule provides an exemption for \"certain non-profit religious employers\"\u00a0that meet a four-part test\u00a0-- essentially churches and synagogues, but also some primary and secondary religious schools.\u00a0\n\nIt's that definition of \"religious employer\" that has prompted the\u00a0U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, with the support of groups such as the\u00a0Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, to fight the rule.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's because it wouldn't cover religious organizations that don't primarily employ or serve people of the same religion \u2014 ruling out many universities, hospitals and charitable groups.\n\nThat would require, say, a Catholic hospital to offer insurance coverage to its employees that included FDA-approved contraceptive drugs \u2014 which includes some drugs that Catholics consider abortion-inducing. Plan B and Ella prevent fertilization of an egg, prompting the FDA to categorize them as contraceptives rather than abortion-inducing drugs, but Catholics argue that Ella\u00a0can be used like the abortifacient RU-486, which isn't considered a contraceptive by the FDA.\n\nThe government is giving such nonprofit religious groups\u00a0an extra year\u00a0to implement the preventive care requirements. But it won't exempt them.\n\nThe decision already faces\u00a0legal challenges\u00a0from Belmont Abbey College and Colorado Christian University.\n\nStill, if you consider a Catholic church to be a \"Catholic institution,\" or a synagogue to be a \"Jewish institution,\" Gingrich isn't correct that the recent federal rule on contraceptives applies. Those nonprofit religious employers could choose whether or not they covered contraceptive services.\n\nOur ruling\nGingrich said that \"the Obama administration ... would impose on every Catholic institution, every Jewish institution, every Protestant institution the Obamacare standard of what you have to buy as insurance.\"\u00a0\n\nHe makes a broad statement in reference to a rule dealing specifically with co-pays for preventive care -- making it sound as though there's a blanket \"Obamacare standard\" for all insurance policies. The reality allows for states to set benchmarks for private individual and small-group plans.\n\nMeanwhile, he ignores an exemption in the federal rule for nonprofit religious employers such as churches and synagogues. That exemption has been condemned by Catholic bishops as too narrow and has been challenged in court. But it makes Gingrich's statement that the rule would \"impose on every ... institution\" inaccurate and misleading. We rate it Mostly False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/dd0ecf5b-876e-4cfe-ac88-5c90949e8e9f", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11679"}
