They were both scams. There\u2019s also no truth to another post going around claiming \"Walmart rewards everyone with $75 coupon to celebrate its 125th Anniversary,\" in exchange for taking a three-question survey.\nA website\u2019s promise of two free tickets on Allegiant after taking a survey isn\u2019t based on reality.
