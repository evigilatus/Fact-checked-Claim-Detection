John Barrow\u2019s plan \"puts the IRS in charge of your health care.\"", "truth_label": "barely-true", "date": "stated on May 28, 2013 in a billboard:", "title": "GOP group targets Barrow's health care votes", "text": "U.S. Rep. John Barrow, a Democrat from the Augusta area, keeps arguing he agrees with many Republicans regarding the federal health care law, aka \"Obamacare.\"\n\nRepeal and replace, he says.\n\nIs there a doctor around to examine Barrow? Republican activists ask.\n\nRepublicans overwhelmingly want the entire law repealed, polls show. Barrow\u2019s position is not strong enough, some GOP activists say.\n\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee recently announced it was paying for mobile billboards to drive through Barrow\u2019s district to criticize what it says is his approach to health care.\n\n\"Congressman Barrow\u2019s Plan: Put the IRS in charge of your health care,\" the ad says.\n\nThe ad includes a telephone number for anyone \"fed up\" with his plan. The ad quickly made the rounds on several political news sites, including The Atlanta Journal Constitution\u2019s Political Insider blog.\n\nPolitiFact Georgia recently fact-checked a somewhat similar claim by the National Republican Senatorial Committee against Barrow and rated it Mostly False. We wanted to find out if the NRCC accurately reflected Barrow\u2019s stance on this issue.\n\nNRCC spokeswoman Katie Prill said the billboard was based on Barrow\u2019s votes against repealing the health care law.\n\n\"The IRS is in charge of implementing Obamacare,\" Prill said in one email.\n\nThe IRS, under fire for its role in scrutinizing some tea party groups and others, is in charge of determining whether individuals have insurance and collecting fines. The Washington Post Fact Checker column recently examined this issue and determined the NRCC claim deserved two Pinocchios, which means there were significant exaggerations or omissions. Other federal agencies, such as the Department of Health and Human Services, are also involved in implementation of the law. Health and Human Services has taken the lead in organizing its implementation, providing information to the public about the law and providing oversight.\n\nBarrow, who fashions himself as a moderate, is consistently one of the top Republican targets during election season. He\u2019s the last white Democrat serving in the U.S. House from the Deep South. The five-term congressman has thus far successfully avoided GOP efforts to oust him.\n\nBarrow\u2019s camp says the claim is specious for several reasons. First, they note the congressman voted in 2010 against the legislation to create the contentious health care law.\n\nSecond, his office says Barrow\u2019s approach to the law is similar to that of many Republicans. He wants to repeal some of the most controversial aspects of the law and keep some elements of it.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Grassley\n\n\nstated on January 14, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulin prices have \"gone THRU THE ROOF for patients/taxpayers bc of manufacturer, health plan & PBM biz practices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Black \u2022 February 2, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBarrow wants to remove:\n\n\n\nThe Independent Payment Advisory Board, which is designed to examine quality and access to care under the law, the effects of changes in payments to providers.\n\n\n\nThe individual mandate, which requires nearly all Americans to have health insurance or face a tax penalty.\n\n\n\nAn employer mandate that businesses with more than 50 full-time employees offer health care coverage to their employees or pay a penalty of $2,000 per worker above 30 employees.\n\n\n\nThe congressman wants to keep the provision that allows children to stay on their parents\u2019 health insurance until they\u2019re 26 years old.\n\nThird, and most pertinent to the NRCC\u2019s claim, Barrow voted against legislation in April 2011 that would fund as many as 16,500 IRS employees House Republicans said were needed to implement the health care law.\n\n\"Further proof that the NRCC is twisting the facts and exaggerating to make their claims,\" said Barrow spokesman Richard Carbo.\n\nPrill pointed out that Barrow voted three times against repealing the law, most recently in May 2013 in a 229-195 vote. Every House Republican voted to repeal the law while only two Democrats voted in favor of repeal. The Democratic-led U.S. Senate has not supported repeal.\n\nBarrow\u2019s votes on portions of the health care law have been across the spectrum.\n\n\"There are a lot of good things in the bill. I don\u2019t believe in voting against the parts that are good. ... We need to amend it, not end it,\" Barrow said after his vote in January 2011 to retain the law.\n\nPrill said Barrow\u2019s position is insufficient.\n\n\"At the end of the day, John Barrow had the opportunity to repeal this law and he chose not to. Whether it was political pressure from (House Minority Leader) Nancy Pelosi or because he truly believes in this law, he made the decision to keep Obamacare in place and for it on Georgia families. It seems like if John Barrow really wanted to fix our health care system, he would have voted for repeal.\"\n\nTo sum up, the NRCC says in its mobile billboard that Barrow\u2019s health care plan \"puts the IRS in charge of your health care.\" Barrow didn\u2019t vote to create the federal health care law. However, the NRCC points out that Barrow\u2019s voted three times against repealing Obamacare, which they say is allowing the law to be implemented. Barrow supports repealing some of the most contentious parts of the law.\n\nBarrow\u2019s camp says what\u2019s most important in this debate is the congressman voted against legislation that would fund additional IRS agents to implement the health care law. The billboards, they say, are disingenuous. It\u2019s not really his plan. The IRS will be involved in the implementation of the law, but so, too, will other federal agencies.\n\nWe believe the billboards omit some important context. We rate this claim Mostly False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09260"}
