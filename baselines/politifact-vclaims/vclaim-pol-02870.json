More than 200 players across the league chose not to stand to show their opposition to Trump\u2019s criticism.\nThen the post said NFL commissioner Roger Goodell \"announced shortly after the game began that every player who \u2018protested\u2019 the National Anthem and showed \u2018immense disrespect to our nation\u2019 would be fined a cool million dollars.\"\nThat isn\u2019t the case, because the article is fake.\nThe same story was reported in posts on many other websites, many without attribution to TheLastLineOfDefense.org. That\u2019s important to note, because TheLastLineOfDefense.org runs only fabricated stories.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA footer note on the bottom of the page said \"everything on this site is a satirical work of fiction.\" The site\u2019s \"about us\" page included a disclaimer that read, \"We present fiction as fact and our sources don\u2019t actually exist.\"\nTheLastLineOfDefense.org is the source of dozens upon dozens of fake news stories. The website is the brainchild of a man named Christopher Blair, who has told PolitiFact he writes absurd claims strictly to trick conservative readers into believing wild stories.\nIn this case, the website attempted to trick readers into thinking the NFL was punishing the Steelers for refusing to come onto the field for the Star-Spangled Banner.\nFormer Army Ranger Alejandro Villanueva, who served for three tours in Afghanistan, was the only Steelers player to leave the locker room to stand for the anthem. The Tennessee Titans and Seattle Seahawks, who played each other in Nashville, also refused to come to the sidelines for the song.\nIt\u2019s not clear who wrote the Goodell story, as the author is only identified as \"Freedom.\" The author replied to an email we sent but would not provide their real name.\nIn reality, Goodell didn\u2019t fine any team or player, and told Sports Illustrated he supported the teams and players.\n\"The way we reacted today, and this weekend, made me proud,\" Goodell said. \"I\u2019m proud of our league.\"\nTheLastLineOfDefense.org was looking to troll readers with a fake news story.
