Chris Christie\u2019s recent changes to the state\u2019s education policy don\u2019t exactly quell rumors that he plans to enter the 2016 GOP presidential field.\nOn May 28, Christie announced the end of the existing Common Core standards in New Jersey.\n\"It's now been five years since Common Core was adopted. And the truth is that it's simply not working,\" he said. \"Instead of solving problems in our classrooms, it is creating new ones.\"\nThis is not the first time critics have accused Christie of flip-flopping on Common Core -- the state-based educational standards aimed at improving students readiness for college and workplace. (Read our past\u00a0fact-checks\u00a0of claims and\u00a0flops\u00a0relating to Common Core.)\nChristie\u2019s decision to nix Common Core is not unexpected, but it is notable considering his initial stance in support of the standards. \"This is one of those areas where I\u2019ve agreed more with the the president than not,\" Christie said in 2011, a year after he implemented them in New Jersey.\nWith an upcoming presidential campaign\u00a0seeming increasingly likely, we decided to check how Christie\u2019s position on Common Core registers on our\u00a0Flip-O-Meter. It is important to note that we are not passing judgment on decisions to change positions. Rather, we are just determining whether they did.\nChristie in support of Common Core\nCommon Core was\u00a0set into motion\u00a0in June 2009 as a collaboration between 49 states and territories. Christie signed off on the standards, and New Jersey adopted them in 2010.\nIn September 2011, the Christie administration and New Jersey\u00a0acting Education Commissioner Chris Cerf worked to implement the standards. Christie praised Common Core standards as \"a building block in our state\u2019s education system meant to ensure that teachers and districts can innovate within a framework of high expectations and accountability.\"\nCommon Core Standards were set to be implemented over a three-year period, and the state Department of Education offered 300 presentations within the first year to provide educators with information about the new initiative.\nIn August 2013, Christie maintained a positive view of the standards. \"We\u2019re doing Common Core in New Jersey and are going to continue,\" he said. He attributed majority Republican opposition to the standards as a \"knee-jerk reaction \u2026 that if the president likes something, the Republicans in Congress don\u2019t.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H. Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps., refused Nancy Pelosi\u2019s request to use the Marines for inauguration security, telling her \u201cwe don\u2019t work for you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 17, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChristie in opposition to Common Core\nChristie\u2019s 180-degree turn on Common Core occurred in slow-motion.\nIn December 2014 he said in an NJTV interview, \"I have real concerns about the Common Core.\"\nThen in February 2015, he expressed \"grave concerns about the way this has been done, especially the way the (Obama) administration has tried to implement it through tying federal funding to these things.\" Christie stated publicly that Common Core was \"in the midst of re-examination\" in New Jersey.\nWe\u2019ve\u00a0fact-checked\u00a0several\u00a0claims\u00a0that Common Core is a federal program or mandate. It\u2019s not. Rather, Christie is referring to the Obama administration using the promise of federal funding to incentivize adoption of Common Core standards. But, despite improving the state\u2019s chances of winning federal money if they adopt educational standards, Common Core itself remains a state-based, voluntary program.\nNonetheless, on May 28, 2015, Christie made the full switch, saying the standards have \"brought confusion and frustration to parents. I\u2019ve heard it every day. It\u2019s brought distance between our teachers and the communities where they work, and instead of solving problems in our classrooms, it is creating morale problems in those classrooms and at home.\"\nChristie\u2019s spokesperson pointed to a document released prior to the governor\u2019s speech on May 28, 2015. The document outlines various efforts Christie made throughout 2014 to canvass the state\u2019s educators and parents about their experiences with Common Core after its three-year implementation that began in 2011. \u00a0\nIn July 2014 he\u00a0established\u00a0a study commission to review, among other student assessments,\u00a0Common Core. Then, in November 2014, Christie announced that he was in the midst of evaluating the Core\u2019s effectiveness.\nChristie attributed his change of heart in May 2015 to the negative feedback he received from the aforementioned study commission and educators\u2019 reviews. In an interview on June 7 on\u00a0CBS\u2019s Face the Nation, Christie said, \"I\u2019m changing because I gave it four years to work \u2026 but in four years, we did not have educators or parents buy into the Common Core.\"\nHowever, there is one element of the standard\u2019s implementation he\u2019s not phasing out:\u00a0PARCC testing. Christie has said PARCC testing will continue, and those tests were developed in line with Common Core standards.\n\"PARCC is a set of assessments meant to test progressions to the standards,\" stated Ashley Jochim, who studies Common Core at the Center for Reinventing Public Education. She added, \"the tests have been developed separately but are meant to align with the Common Core.\" \u00a0\nOur ruling\nChristie was a supporter of Common Core, but five years following its implementation he has become a critic. He attributes his changed stance to negative reviews from educators and parents within the state. We rate his change of position a Full Flop.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06271"}
