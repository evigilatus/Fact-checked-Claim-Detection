Bush. The meme has been shared more than 25,000 times.\nIt reads: \"Hilary (sic) has donated every cent she's ever earned from speaking fees to charity. Bush keeps all of his speaking fees.\"\n\nWe\u2019ll leave Bush out of this for the moment. As for the claim that Clinton \"donated every cent she's ever earned from speaking fees to charity,\" that\u2019s wrong.\nNo one from the Occupy Democrats group responded to our request for comment, but we believe its claim is based on 2014 comments by Clinton. When students at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, asked that Clinton return her $225,000 speaking fee, Clinton noted that \"all of the fees have been donated to the Clinton Foundation for it to continue its life-changing and life-saving work.\"\n\"So it goes from a foundation at a university to another foundation,\" Clinton told ABC News, with regard to the UNLV speech.\nThe UNLV donation is documented on the Clinton Foundation website. It includes this list of \"speeches by President, Secretary, and Chelsea Clinton (that) have helped support the implementation of the Clinton Foundation\u2019s work around the world.\" The speaking fee from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, for instance, is listed as a donation from the UNLV Foundation.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo are other speeches at universities and colleges as well as a few speeches organized by private groups such as Citibank, Chicago House\u00a0and Goldman Sachs.\nBut that\u2019s not all of the speeches for which Clinton has been paid.\nIn May, the New York Times published Clinton\u2019s 2015 financial disclosure form. Covering a period from January 2014 to March 2015, Clinton lists a total of 51 speech fees that have been added to her personal account from a variety of companies. Not including her husband\u2019s fees which also appear on the same disclosure, Clinton\u2019s speech fees end up totaling more than $11 million.\nSpokesmen for the Clinton Foundation and Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign declined comment.\nOur ruling\nOccupy Democrats claimed Clinton \"has donated every cent she's ever earned from speaking fees to charity.\"\nThat\u2019s a misreading of Clinton\u2019s comments in 2014, when she said speaking fees at colleges and universities were donated to the Clinton Foundation.\nClinton\u2019s financial disclosure form includes 51 speeches in which Clinton was compensated directly.\nThis claim rates False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-06308"}
