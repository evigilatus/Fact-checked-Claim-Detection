He calls himself a democratic socialist.\nThere aren\u2019t many votes to look at when it comes to Russia, and Sanders\u2019 voting history isn\u2019t as clear-cut as the post claims.\u00a0\nSanders\u2019 Russia sanctions votes\nIn recent years, the United States sanctioned Russia in response to allegations of corruption and human rights abuses. It continued sanctions after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\u00a0\nSome of the sanctions were imposed by presidential executive order, without any vote in the Senate.\nHere are the key votes:\nDec. 6, 2012: Sanders voted no on the Magnitsky Act, which imposed visa bans and asset freezes on Russian officials linked to the 2009 death in prison of Sergei Magnitsky, a 37-year-old Russian whistleblower.\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChris Dodd\n\n\nstated on September 9, 2007 in a debate in Miami, Fla.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're spending $1.6 billion for all of Latin America in terms of aid and assistance, a\nfraction of what we're spending in Iraq, the $500 billion we've spent there\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jody Kyle \u2022 September 14, 2007\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGQ reported on Feb. 23, 2020, that Sanders never explained his vote, but \"fellow Dems suggest that it was because a free trade provision had been tucked into the legislative package.\"\nSanders\u2019 campaign emphasized to us that in 2015, the Senate with unanimous consent extended the law to countries other than Russia, and said it was \"more robust\" than the original law.\u00a0\nJune 14 and 15, 2017: Sanders votes yes on an amendment to a bill, adding Russia to a bill that was sanctioning Iran.\nBut the next day, Sanders voted no on the overall legislation, which put new sanctions on North Korea, as well as Russia and Iran.\nOn Russia, the bill targeted the country\u2019s aggression in Ukraine and Syria, citing corruption, human rights abuses and weapons sales.\u00a0\nSanders said at the time he feared the bill would endanger the 2015 nuclear deal, which was aimed at curbing Iran\u2019s ability to develop a nuclear weapon. \"I am strongly supportive of the sanctions on Russia included in this bill. It is unacceptable for Russia to interfere in our elections here in the United States, or anywhere around the world. There must be consequences for such actions,\" he said in a statement at the time.\nJan. 16, 2019: The Senate failed to stop the Trump administration from easing sanctions on companies linked to Oleg Deripaska, a Russian billionaire with ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\u00a0\nSanders missed the vote, but his absence did not affect the outcome. He was meeting with women who accused his 2016 presidential campaign of sexual misconduct.\nOur ruling\nA post claims: \"Not once in his entire career in Washington, D.C., which started way back in 1991, has Democratic Socialist Bernie Sanders ever voted yes on sanctions against Russia.\"\nSanders voted once, in 2017, to add Russia to a sanctions bill. But on the final version of that bill, which carried sanctions against Russia, North Korea and Iran, he voted no. Moreover, he voted no on a Russia sanctions bill in 2012.\nThe statement is partially accurate. We rate it Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17481"}
