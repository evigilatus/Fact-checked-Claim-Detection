A picture of a snake wrapped around a pistol that says, \"Don't wriggle at me\" is shown in the mail. Along the bottom, the so-called Jefferson statement says: \"When governments fear people, there is freedom. When people fear government, there is tyranny. The strongest reason for retaining the right to retain and carry arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves from tyranny in government.\" But did he say it? The article was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Like many statements attributed to Jefferson online, there is no reliable evidence to support that Jefferson said or wrote these words. On January 12, 2021, he wrote in an Instagram article saying that Joe Biden remained silent about the violence in Black Lives-Mite protests. By Tom Kircher: January 16, 2021, according to Montesilo.org, Thomas Jefferson's website, the statement cannot be found in any of the writings of the former President. Each of the two parts of the quotation appears on the list of the \"fair quotations\" website. Researchers in Montecello found that the first sentence: \"When governments fear people, there is freedom. When people are afraid of government, there is tyranny, probably coming from a series of discussions about socialism published in 1914. At some point, a man named John Basil Barnhill said, \"Where the people fear your government is tyranny. Where the government fears the people you have freedom.\" Some differences in the quotation begin with: \"No free man may ever be prevented from using weapons,\" as in the first sentence, which comes from the first of the three drafts of the Virginia Constitution of Jefferson in 1776, although in the second and third drafts, the sentence has been amended to read: \"No free man may ever be removed from the law from the use of weapons (within his territory or premises).\" Once again, the last sentence on the use of weapons to protect against tyranny in the Government, Montsello officials say, \"Do not appear in the drafts of the Constitution of Virginia or the text as adopted, or in any other well-known writings of Jefferson.\" In the absence of evidence of the validity of the quotation, we assess this error.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00255"}
