Scott Walker since the race began.\nKelda Roys, a former state representative from Madison and one of eight Democratic contenders, has been sharp with criticism as it relates to jobs and the economy.\nAt a May 15, 2018 meet-and-greet in downtown Madison, she told those in attendance: \"Just last year alone, we lost 4,000 manufacturing jobs.\"\nThat echoed a claim from a series of tweets on April 18, 2018.\nIn one tweet, Roys wrote: \"Households in Wisconsin have paid over $500 for one of Walker\u2019s corporate tax giveaways. Much of the giveaway went to just a handful of the richest Wisconsinites and it didn\u2019t stop our state from losing almost 4,000 manufacturing jobs in 2017.\"\nManufacturing jobs are critical to Wisconsin\u2019s economy.\nAccording to the most recent annual data from December 2017, the state ranks 9th in the nation in total manufacturing jobs -- and those jobs are responsible for 16 percent of total employment in the state.\nSo, did Wisconsin really lose 4,000 manufacturing jobs in 2017?\nCampaign admits error \nWhen we contacted the Roys campaign to ask for backup to the claim, communications director Brian Evans basically said, \"Oops.\"\n\"The tweet should have said 2016 instead of 2017, and we fully admit that this was an error on our part,\" Evans said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin.\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Labor Statistics and its Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, Wisconsin lost 3,726 manufacturing jobs between December 2015 and December 2016.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, if Roys had actually focused on 2016 instead of 2017 her claim would be on target.\nEven then, that gives a narrow picture of what has happened with manufacturing jobs under Walker.\nOther years\nFrom December 2016 to December 2017, the most recent full year available, Wisconsin gained 8,032 manufacturing jobs, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said. This was a 1.7 percent increase in manufacturing jobs, bringing the statewide total to 469,453.\nIn 2017, Wisconsin ranked 7th among states with the highest percentage of growth in manufacturing jobs.\nWhile we have the charts out, how has Walker done since taking office?\nIn December 2010, the month before Walker took office, there were 434,723 manufacturing jobs. In December 2017, the most recent full-year available, there were 469,453.\nThat\u2019s a 34,730 -- or 8 percent -- increase.\nOur rating\nOn Twitter and on the campaign trail, Roys has said Wisconsin lost nearly 4,000 manufacturing jobs in 2017.\nRoys has her years mixed up -- and her campaign admits it.\nWhile Roys would have been right for 2016, growth in 2017 was roughly double the loss in 2016. Compared to the start of Walker\u2019s term, there has been an 8 percent increase in manufacturing employment.\nWe rate her claim False.\u00a0\n Share the Facts 2018-07-23 14:25:04 UTC   PolitiFact    2 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: False  Wisconsin lost \"almost 4,000 manufacturing jobs in 2017.\"    Kelda Helen Roys Democratic candidate for Wisconsin governor https://www.facebook.com/keldaroys/videos/10155622582309077/   In a speech, tweet Wednesday, April 18, 2018 2018-04-18    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01829"}
