Trump encouraged a reduction in the number of unemployed minorities and said: \"For the first time in history, most of the new first-age employees are minorities and women.\" Is Trump right that minorities and women for the first time represent most of the new employees of the first working age? The re-election campaign told Trump Bolivi Fuckett that Trump was relying on reports from the Washington Post. However, Trump did not mention the accuracy of the post analysis. The Post found that, for the first time, most of the first-age employees were coloured persons, and that this trend was dominated by women in this sector. One economist told us that the President &apos; s statement and the wording of the Post article differ greatly. The Washington Post Analysis of 9 September, an article in the Washington Post, states that \"the sudden increase in the number of minority women receiving jobs has helped to push the United States workforce across a historic threshold. For the first time, most of the new employees of the first working age (25 to 54) are coloured persons.\" The Post noted that \"the minority employed white employees\" in 2018 and that women were \"mostly leading this trend.\" The newspaper stated that its findings were based on data that the Ministry of Labour had begun to collect in the 1970s. The Labour Statistics Office of the Ministry of Labour informed Politi Fact that it did not have data identifying \"new appointments\" by age, race, Spanish ethnic origin or sex. But it is theoretically possible, as mail did, to analyse different sets of data to build something that can be defined as \"new lease,\" and the Bureau said. The mail analysis used detailed partial data from the current population survey and other relevant statistics, and economists who directed the Post said about how labour market data were analysed. Specifically, the Postal Service downloaded an extract from the International Monitoring System (a project of the University of Minnesota) \"that allows researchers to carry out a more detailed analysis than the number published each month in the well-known job report,\" as stated by Nick Banker, an economist in the actual employment laboratory focusing on the United States labour market and consulted by the Service on data analysis. Overall, the Service concluded that, based on the data collected since the 1970s, most of the new employees of the first working age (from 25 to 54 years of age) are coloured persons, and that women in that sector are pressing this trend. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 On January 11, 2012, this was not the same statement that minorities and women represented most of the new employees, as Tramp said. Bunker said, \"The President's equivalent of discoveries is incorrect because it includes white women other than Spain.\" Ernie Tedechi, Managing Director and Policy Economist at Evercore ISI, also told us that the majority of first-year job seekers over the past 24 months have been colored. Tedeschi uses the term \"job seekers\" to refer to persons who move from work without work for one month to work the following month. What is the effect on this trend? \"Many of what is going on here is population growth: America at peak age is much less than white than it was in the past,\" said Tedsky. As a result, first-age Americans, especially women, constitute a growing share of the population of primary school age in general and of the non-working population. University achievement is also rising for all, especially for colored Americans, which increases their access to jobs, as Tedsky said, who provided post-mail guidance on how to analyse labour market data. The letter highlighted additional factors driving this trend: the encouragement of Latin women to work outside the home, the need for two incomes to pay bills, the deportation of men and the need for women to enter the labour force to support their families. Banker said: \"This trend is likely to continue if the labour market remains strong.\" \"But the economic downturn may reverse the trend, and we may never see colored people make up most of the new primary-age employment again until the part-time labour market is strengthened.\" Our Governor Trump said, \"For the first time in history, most of the new employees of the first working age are minorities and women.\" The Trump re-election campaign stated that Trump &apos; s claim was based on an analysis by the Washington Post. But the Trump formula is canceled. According to the Post, according to data collected by the Government since the 1970s, most of the new employees of the first working age (25 to 54 years) are minorities, and minority women often move this trend. This is not the same as the statement that minorities and women (of all races and ethnicities) make up most of the new employees of the first working age. The Trump statement is partially accurate, but it ignores important details or leaves things out of context. We value it half right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00115"}
