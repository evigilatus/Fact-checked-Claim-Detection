(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nWe found no credible evidence to back up the headline.\nOld claim, updated for Trump era\nHere\u2019s a sliver of accuracy contained in the article: ABC News has had a longstanding policy that forbids reporters from wearing any lapel pins, according to top executives.\nHowever, virtually everything else about the claim is wrong.\nThe policy applies to \"any lapel pins of any sort,\" not just American flags, former ABC News president David Westin told CNN.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe policy was also in place prior to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, according to Westin\u2019s description of the policy (hat tip to our friends at Snopes for flagging the 2012 interview):\n\"We\u2019d long had a policy at ABC News that we wouldn\u2019t let people wear any lapel pins of any sort,\" Westin said. \"The theory being that when you\u2019re reporting the news, you should be reporting the news, not taking a position. I said quickly (after the 9/11 attacks), \u2018We\u2019re going to stick with our policy and stand by that.\u2019 I believe to this day that was the right decision.\"\nAccording to a Snopes fact-check from October 2001, ABC News was singled out because a nationally syndicated article suggested the network\u2019s policy made it an outlier among news networks at a time of heightened patriotism. \u00a0\nThus spawned the false claim about ABC News enacting a new policy banning lapel pins in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks that claimed the lives of nearly 3,000 people.\nNow the claim has been updated to make it appear the ABC News\u2019 \"ban\" (in truth, a longstanding policy) is a response to Donald Trump\u2019s presidency.\u00a0\nThe political conditions may have changed since the claim was first born, but it is still untrue.\nAs an aside, we\u2019d note that the older claim that President Barack Obama sought to ban American flag pins is an extreme distortion of reality.\nWe rate this False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01812"}
