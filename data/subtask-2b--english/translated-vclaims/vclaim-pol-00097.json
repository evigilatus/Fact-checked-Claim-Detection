As his visit to villages approached, Democrats in Florida attacked Trump's record in the medical care program, suggesting that he wanted to weaken the health care program for the elderly. On September 30, the State party tweeted about the \"Sam Register\" of Tramp, which contained a chart of $575 billion reduced medical care in the proposed Trump budget for 2020.\" == sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man This week, in honor of visiting Trump, we will share important facts from #Tromps ToxicRecor TMPL.twitter.com/gtp5wt9FI2 - Democrats in Florida (@FlaDems) September 30, 2019. This statement is misleading. This represents a projected decrease in future spending over a decade on the health-care programme for older persons. It should be noted that President Barack Obama has also called for a reduction in spending on medical care. The first thing to know about the Tramp budget proposal for 2020 is that it is merely an expression of Trump's priorities and ideas. The changes proposed by Trump to slow spending growth will occur only if Congress enacts a law. Expenditure on medical care is rising almost every year in the proposed budget for Trump. Medical care is expected to grow by about $10 trillion over a decade. The reduction of medical care costs under the Trump budget is expected to amount to approximately $600 billion over the next 10 years, compared with current expenditure levels, according to the analysis of the non-partisan budget office in Congress in May. To a large extent, the two-party committee agrees for a responsible federal budget, stating that the Trump budget proposal reduces expenditure on medical care by $515 billion, or $575 billion. Carl Ruff mentioned in an interview with Fox News on December 22, 2009, \"In Florida, Sun. Bill Nelson... got $25 billion to $30 billion.\" \u2022 December 23, 2009, about 85 percent of savings come from cuts in medical care paid to service providers. \"These cuts would essentially reduce the payments made by medical care providers, and I do not expect them to have negative effects on the beneficiaries of medical care,\" Matt Fidler, an economist at the Left Brookings Institution, who already told Polity Fuckett. The budget proposals for medical care are also, in my view, a very reasonable policy. However, not all of the proposed plots are on service providers. The changes in section D of the Medically prescribed Medicines Insurance Program may be the most obvious example of the medical care cuts in the Trump budget that affect ordinary Americans. While one proposal would reduce the costs to those who bear the highest costs of drugs, another would expose those whose costs are lower to higher fees. In the end, Trump's budget reduces payments to people who rely on prescription drugs by $50 billion. The idea of limiting the growth of medical care is not new - many Trump ideas build on the ideas originally proposed in President Obama's budgets. The recent Obama budget has proposed a reduction of expenditure on medical care by $420 billion over 10 years. (The Republicans accused Obama and the Democrats of cutting medical care several times, an allegation we never classified better than half the truth.) The ruling Florida Democratic Party wrote on Twitter $575 billion reduced medical care in the proposed Trump budget for 2020.\" There's some truth to the attack. However, Democrats have overlooked the fact that the figure relates to a decade of reduced spending. It is also proposed for a reduction in projected future expenditure. Expenditure on medical care will remain generally high. We're assessing this statement half right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00097"}
