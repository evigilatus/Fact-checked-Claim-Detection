Biden says goodbye to the audience, then walks to a table and picks up a folder. After standing there for a moment, Biden slowly makes his way off stage.\n\"Yikes. If he was a Republican the 25th Amendment talk would be trending and rightfully so,\" Trump Jr. said in his tweet. The 25th Amendment outlines ways to handle presidential power if a president is incapacitated.\n\n(Screenshot from Twitter)\nThe video has more than 2.8 million views, and we found similar clips published on Facebook.

This video is no different.\nThe clip comes from the end of a Jan. 16 event in which Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris announced several members of their White House science team. Biden did not stand around looking confused \u2014\u00a0the video Trump Jr. shared was edited.\nThe original footage shows Biden making some closing remarks alongside Harris. Another angle shows that, when Biden leaves the podium and stands at the table for a few seconds, he\u2019s waiting for other people to leave the stage.\nWatch for yourself below:\n\nThe video Trump Jr. shared does not show anyone else on stage with Biden. It also edits out the sound of people leaving before him. The clip is an example of what the Washington Post calls \"omission,\" or \"editing out large portions from a video and presenting it as a complete narrative, despite missing key elements.\"\nWe reached out to the White House for a comment, but we haven\u2019t heard back.\nTrump Jr.\u2019s tweet is inaccurate and ridiculous. We rate it Pants on Fire!", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-19187"}
