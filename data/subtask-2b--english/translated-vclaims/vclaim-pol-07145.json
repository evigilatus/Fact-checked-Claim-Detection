If the measure passes on election day, the district sales tax will increase by 1 per cent. Therefore, an opposition group made it the alleged injustice of all that the cornerstone of their campaign. No traffic taxes, a popular group opposed to green light Benillas in an e-mail to the voters said that the transition from a property tax to a growing unfair sales tax by the transit authority Benillas Sincost would continue forever. \"They call it tax swaps,\" but PSTA revenues will increase from $32 million a year to $148 million a year,\" says e-mail. \"Any financial dictionary will tell you that this is not a tax exchange.\" This is an income increase of over 300 percent! And the tax is permanent, and we don't get to vote on this again.\" The group was remarkably aware of its wording here, because they said in the past that the trade was \"a tax increase of 300%.\" We miscalculated that, because this figure would be the change in the budget for the operation of the Tax and Exchange Agency, and not in any individual taxpayers. Will tax swaps be permanent, though? We decided to find out. The county-wide transport plan aims to expand the bus service by adding roads and extending hours, but it will also add a 24-mile light railway between St. Petersburg and Claire Water. In order to pay for the changes, the province &apos; s sales tax will rise from 7 per cent to 8 per cent, to the highest tax rate in the state. Some items, such as medicine, groceries, and some agricultural and start-up equipment, will be exempt from sales tax, and the increase will be limited to the first $5,000 in major purchases. This would replace the current funding of the Benillas Sonkost Transit Authority through a real estate tax. Greenlight Benillas is different from something like Penny of Penellas, a 1 cent capital improvement tax in the county. Penny of Penelhas has to be re-authorised by voters every 10 years. Here, the inter-local agreement concluded by the Procurement Support Agency and the provincial committee established specifically for the plan do not guarantee a future vote on an increase in sales tax. The \"tax exchange,\" as the organizers of the Green Light Benillas call it, would strengthen the budget of the Authority from about $34 million to up to $120 million to $130 million, calculated by PSA. If voters agree to the change in November, the change will enter into force on 1 January 2016. Any future changes to the Green Light plan, such as the extension of the proposed railway line or any other major amendment, would be subject to a referendum. Technically, the property tax will not go far, as the Public Security Agency needs the State to agree to abolish it. (Joff) Rick Scott rejected a bill in 2012 that would have done so, eliminating the property tax and replacing it with an increase in the sales tax if voters chose to do so. Now, if Green Light Benillas passes, the PSA will determine the mill rate to zero and start collecting sales tax. The legislature could abolish property tax in the future, but the fact that such tax would continue to exist in the draft property tax laws had led to no taxation of routes that could lead to double taxation. The \"Green Light Benillas\" rules state that the tax authority cannot obtain the two sets of tax revenues. The new sales tax itself remains in place \"until it is abolished,\" as the November 4 polling language says. There is no tax on the tracks arguing that cancellation will never happen, because of the way PSTA and Pinellas have agreed to fund the project. On February 5, 2021, Louis Jacobson wrote that the local agreement states that additional tax funds can only be used to finance \"green light\" projects, as told by the Chief Development Officer of PSTA Cassandra Portchers. The Act also provides that the province shall continue to fund the Agency &apos; s operations and maintenance. However, there are ways of abolishing the tax in the agreement. If the plan is not implemented as promised or within the time frame allocated to it, if the funds derived from the sales tax are used in something other than the \"green light\" plan, and if there is a default or unforeseen disaster in the future, the tax can be reduced or eliminated. It is also scheduled to be reviewed within 50 years and every 20 years thereafter. But in general, it will not be easy to stop the tax once it starts. This is because tax money will pay for a large construction project. Joel White of the Benillas District Prosecutor's Office said that there were written clauses in the contract that allowed contracts of guaranteed tax funds to secure financing for capital projects, such as more buses and the proposed light rail line. Wyatt said unless one of the motives for the termination of the sales tax was met, it was likely that the District Committee would not study the matter. Because the sales tax is subject to the same law governing initiatives as Penny to Benillas, voters must be placed in order to be enacted, as she said. Thereafter, there are few options for cancellation. The Benillas could ask the Committee to address the issue, but that would not have any results either, as Wyatt had said. The population was unable to force the Committee to put the matter back on the ballot. \"Sure, anyone can approach the committee at any time,\" she said. \"When money becomes connected, however, it is very difficult to retreat.\" As activists in \"No Tax for Tracking\" said, these steps are highly unlikely, because if the county terminates the tax, they will have to find a way to continue paying their obligations to PSTA. Portchers agreed that the mere termination of the sales tax or the reimbursing of the property tax - which would bring much less money to the operating budget - would lead to major problems. Portchers said, \"You can't stop it without some consequences,\" pointing out that the operational budget isn't just the issue, there are a lot of funds promised from the states and the union that are tied up in the plan. \"You have to pay all those grants.\" Our ruling \"No traffic taxes\" said that the sales tax of \"Green Light Penellas 1 cents\" is permanent, and we don't get to vote on this again. There is no provision in the proposal for a further vote. However, to say that tax is \"permanent\" also goes too far. While it is certainly likely that the sales tax will be effective in the foreseeable future if approved, the tax contains a review clause 50 years from now. The long time frame is due to the fact that taxes are dedicated to paying for major long-term construction projects such as light railways. As to whether the District Committee would return the question to the electorate, it was unlikely that it would be impossible. The statement is partially accurate but omits important details.
