Debbie Wasserman Schultz of South Florida says she is in the pocket of big banks and isn\u2019t looking out for consumers who get crushed by debt from payday loans.\n\"My opponent, after taking hundreds of thousands of dollars from Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street banks, has voted to prevent the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFTP) from regulating payday loans and addressing racial discrimination in car loans,\" said Tim Canova on his website.\nCanova, a first-time candidate and professor at Nova Southeastern University, is challenging Wasserman Schultz in the August Democratic primary in a Broward/Miami-Dade district. The race has drawn national attention because Wasserman Schultz is the Democratic National Committee chair.\nDid Canova accurately describe her donations from banks and her votes related to payday loans and car loans?\nThere is some truth to his attack, but each one requires explanation.\nDonations from Wall Street banks\nCanova\u2019s campaign pointed to donations from banks, securities/investment firms and finance/credit companies to Wasserman Schultz\u2019s campaign committee and her political action committee, or PAC.\nAt PolitiFact Florida\u2019s request, the Center for Responsive Politics compiled the large individual donations (more than $200) and donations to her PAC starting with her 2006 election. The center found she received $309,020 from commercial banks, which represented about 2 percent of the total; $408,450 from securities/investment firms, and $325,850 from finance/credit companies.\nHer leadership PAC, Democrats Win Seats, received donations from the Goldman Sachs PAC: $5,000 in 2016 and $10,000 in 2014.\nWasserman Schultz\u00a0spokesman\u00a0Sean Bartlett\u00a0pointed to donations only to her campaign and plucked out what he said were the \"big bank\" donations. That totaled $15,400, including $4,000 from Goldman Sachs.\nBut the Center for Responsive Politics shows a longer list of bank donations even if we only examine her campaign committee. It shows $171,303 for \"commercial bank\" industry donations.\nPayday loan bill\nPayday loans are small, short-term loans that borrowers promise to repay out of their next paycheck at a high rate of interest. It is a controversial industry that targets the poor and is disproportionately located in minority communities.\nFor years, payday loans were unregulated by the federal government, although some states had their own laws.\nPresident Barack Obama took a step toward regulating the industry when he signed a bill in 2010 that included the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Republicans have targeted the bureau for years.\nEnter some Democrats into the fray -- including Wasserman Schultz, who\u00a0has gotten about $68,000 from payday lenders, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\nWasserman Schultz is among Florida lawmakers who have defended Florida\u2019s payday law despite the fact that some consumer advocates have bashed it and say it traps the poor in a debt cycle. Wasserman Schultz\u2019s position is to give precedence to the state law, her spokesman said.\nOn the federal level, the bureau released an outline of payday loan rules in March 2015 and is expected to announce a more complete proposal within the next several months. Congress doesn\u2019t have to approve it but can introduce legislation to kill it.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin Nunes\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in an interview on Fox\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRepublicans have no way to communicate\u201d after tech companies cut off Parler.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Amy Sherman \u2022 January 13, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll but one member of Florida\u2019s congressional delegation (Tom Rooney) signed a letter in April 2015 pushing back against the proposed rules. Instead, they want the bureau to look at Florida\u2019s law as a model.\nThat led U.S. Rep. Dennis Ross, a Florida Republican, to file the \"Consumer Protection and Choice Act,\" H.R. 4018 in November. Half of the 24 cosponsors are from Florida, including Wasserman Schultz, and nine of the cosponsors are Democrats.\nCanova\u2019s website said Wasserman Schultz \"voted\" on the bill, but it was only referred to a committee without a vote. (After we pointed that out to Canova\u00a0senior adviser Richard Bell, the campaign changed the website to say \"co-sponsored\" instead of \"voted.\")\nThe bill states that if the bureau determines that a state\u2019s law meets the federal requirements, then only state law will apply. It would also delay federal regulations for two years, which would allow states to come up with their own laws.\nMore than 200 consumer or civil rights groups -- including the NAACP, National Council of La Raza, Southern Poverty Law Center and the Consumer Federation of America -- wrote a letter to Congress urging them to defeat the bill. They argued that the bill favors an \"industry-backed Florida law\" and would hurt consumers.\nFlorida\u2019s 2001 payday loan law was a compromise and included protections that were intended to help the poor avoid an endless cycle of debt.\u00a0But the loans leave consumers stuck on a debt treadmill in Florida, where they have racked up $2.5 billion in fees since 2005, according to the Center for Responsible Lending\u2019s March report. In the past year, the average Florida payday loan had an annual rate of 278 percent.\nRichard Cordray, head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, disputed Ross\u2019 description of Florida\u2019s law as the \"gold standard\" during a congressional hearing on March 16.\nIn Florida, \"these loans are still being made above the 300 percent, and they are being rolled over on average nine times,\" Cordray said.\nBartlett argued that Wasserman Schultz has fought against \"abusive payday lending practices\" and pointed to her vote on a separate bill in 2015. She voted against HR 766, the Financial Institution Customer Protection Act, which opponents argued would have prevented the Justice Department from going after the financial industry.\nRacial discrimination in car loans\nCanova also said Wasserman Schultz prevented action to stop racial discrimination for car loans. This part of Canova\u2019s attack relates to a 2013 bulletin from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which recommended steps for auto lenders to avoid discrimination. The bulletin was intended to provide clarity about existing law.\nBut the House of Representatives pushed back against the bureau by passing a bill to nullify the bulletin. The bill passed the House 332-96 in November 2015 and hasn\u2019t had a vote in the Senate. Wasserman Schultz was one of 88 Democrats who voted in favor of it, while 96 Democrats opposed it.\nProponents of the bill -- including auto dealers -- said the bureau\u2019s efforts would increase costs for consumers. Groups that represented minorities wanted the new guidelines.\n\"This legislation in no way prevented the CFPB from addressing racial discrimination in car loans, and the congresswoman does not support that as a policy position,\" her spokesman said.\nThe bill hasn\u2019t been acted on, and discrimination investigations can\u00a0continue. A few months after the House vote, Toyota agreed to a $21.9 million settlement to black and Asian buyers.\nOur ruling\nCanova says Wasserman Schultz \"after taking hundreds of thousands of dollars from Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street banks, has voted to prevent the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau from regulating payday loans and addressing racial discrimination in car loans.\"\nHer campaign committee and PAC have taken $309,020 from commercial banks since her re-election campaign in 2006 -- about 2 percent of the total. That includes $15,000 in donations from Goldman Sachs to her leadership PAC.\nThe payday loan bill hasn\u2019t had a vote in the House yet, although Wasserman Schultz is a co-sponsor. The bill would not prevent the bureau from regulating payday loans entirely, but it would cede power to the states, including Florida, which has its own payday law that some advocates have criticized as weak.\nShe voted for a bill that squashed bureau guidelines that were intended to provide clarity about the law on racial discrimination related to car loans.\nWe rate this claim Mostly True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/1e77c505-145b-41ad-b15e-2f1da0a221da", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05189"}
