The host of Stephen Colbert told Aurourke CBS late in the night that he had helped to increase the turnout among young voters and that he had done an unusually good job for a democratic candidate in Lone Star State, where Democrats had not won a state-wide race since 1994. Youth voter turnout for early voting increased by 500 percent. We won more votes than any democracy in the history of the state of Texas,\" said O'Rourke in the 13th of June. His campaign did not come back to us, but when we took a closer look at the data, we found that Aurourke's bragging was on target. Young voters were more than 500 percent more likely to vote early. The part of the Orrick statement about increased participation of young voters is due to the research done by Shest Smart. On 30 October, the company issued a study on data on early voting throughout the country. The company used official state election numbers and then used a combination of general and proprietary data to analyse these early turnout data through several demographic categories, including age. This has led to a number of news articles indicating an increase of 500 per cent in early voting by young people in Texas. However, because the study was released one week before election day, we wondered whether this difference had continued through the final statements. The Great Smart website contains the final figures for 2018. The report lists 118,383 Texans between the ages of 18 and 29 voting early in the 2014 general election, compared with 674,027 people voting early in 2018. The early voting figure in 2018 was 5.7 times higher than in 2014, almost six times the increase of 500 per cent. The increase was lower - although still significant - by 200 per cent once votes were included in the electoral calendar. However, in the interview with Colbert, Aurourke was clear about the measure he was using. Further data from 2018, from the Tafts University Information and Research Centre on civic learning and civic participation, found that the overall youth turnout rate in Texas - not just early voting - almost tripled during 2014. This is even higher than the increase the Smart target found. The Tafts study found that Aurourc experienced the highest levels of support in the provinces, with high proportions of young voters, especially young Latinos. :: Note: Aurourk hired StimSmart to work on the data projects, but the data mentioned here were from a publicly released project in 50 states undertaken by StimSmart, and not something paid or influenced by StimSmart. \"We have won more votes than any democracy in Texas's history.\" The part of his assertion about winning more than any political party in Texas is also true, even though O'Rourke benefited from the rapid growth of the state's population. He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. By Bill McCarthy: January 12, 2021, we looked at the voting totals of the state-wide democratic candidates who ran in the last election - the presidency, the Senate, the Governor, the Attorney General, and other state-wide offices. Here is a summary of what we found, along with the totals of Lindon B. Johnson in 1964, a Texani who won an overwhelming presidential victory that year. In general, as the table shows, Democrats ran particularly hard in Texas in 2018. It was a good year for the party at the national level, and O'Rourke ended up becoming unusually popular among Texas voters. Although the presidential election in the presidential year is usually higher than the mid-term election, at least seven Democrats in Texas won more votes in 2018 than Barack Obama won in any of his presidency in the state. The 2018 candidates who did so were candidates for the post of Attorney General, Deputy Governor, Commissioner for Agriculture, Commissioner for Railways, Controller, Land Commissioner and Governor. He was the only candidate before 2018, who approached the top of this list, Hillary Clinton, the presidential candidate for Democrats in 2016. Of course, all of these candidates in 2018, including Aurourke, were blessed with their candidacy after the Texas population had expanded dramatically. \"Texas has seen its voter turnout more than fivefold over the past 55 years, from 3 million in 1964 to 7.7 million in 1990 and 15.8 million in 2019,\" said Mark P. Jones, a politician at Rice University. However, O'Rourke won all of them, becoming the first democracy in Texas to win four million or more votes in state elections. Aurourke's share of votes - 48.3% - is much lower than that of Democrats when Texas was a democracy-dominated State, or at least more competitive than it is today. However, during the current period, which has lasted for two decades, and in which the Republicans dominate Texas, the Aurourc offer has been a major advance for the Democrats, despite its loss. He won more votes than any State-level democracy since 1998, when Paul Hobei won 49 per cent in the race for the State Comptroller. (Hoby lost, too.) The Governor, O'Rourke, said that in 2018, when he ran for Senate, \"the participation of young voters in early voting rose by 500 percent. We have won more votes than any democracy in the history of Texas.\" Its emphasis on the participation of young voters is supported by an analysis of State election data by StrectSmart. He is right that no democracy has ever received more crude votes in the elections for the State of Texas than he has won, an achievement achieved through a combination of his electoral success, the pro-democracy environment of 2018, and the rapid growth of the population in Texas in recent years. We're assessing his statement right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00503"}
