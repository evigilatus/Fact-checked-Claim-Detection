May wants to end the county\u2019s existing form of government, particularly the CEO position. He has said he\u2019d explore the possibility of a full-time county commission or a full-time commission chair. Any such changes must be approved by the Georgia Legislature, which may review proposals in the upcoming session.\nMay brought University of North Carolina School of Government associate professor Kimberly Nelson to the town hall meetings to explain the forms of government used across the country. One form of county government, she said, is as antiquated as the VCR.\n\"The commission form of government is definitely losing favor in the United States,\" Nelson said at a Dec. 3 forum held at Rehoboth Presbyterian Church in Tucker.\nPolitiFact Georgia was at the meeting. We wanted to figure out if what Nelson told the audience was correct.\nDeKalb\u2019s seven commission seats technically are part-time jobs, although many commissioners argue they work full time. In addition to the publicly elected commissioners, DeKalb has a chief executive officer who is elected by the voters and is in charge of the county\u2019s operations. While commissioners approve some contracts and the annual budget, the CEO wields great power. For example, the CEO can change purchasing policy without the approval of commissioners. Many say that is the most unique form of county government in Georgia.\nMost U.S. counties use one of three forms of government. The largest number of counties use the \"commission\" form, in which a board of commissioners -- or sometimes a lone commissioner -- runs the county\u2019s day-to-day operations.\nThe second is the \"administrator/manager\" form of government, by which commissioners hire someone to run the county\u2019s operations, like Cobb County\u2019s current structure. The third is the \"elected executive\" form where county residents vote for someone to lead and run the government, much like DeKalb\u2019s current structure.\nNelson handed out fliers that contained a breakdown of which forms of governments were used by the nation\u2019s 3,000 or so counties in 1989 and in 2001.\n\n\n\n\nGovernment type\n\n\n1989\n\n\n2001\n\n\n\n\nCommission\n\n\n61.5%\n\n\n55.4%\n\n\n\n\nCommissioner-administrator/manager\n\n\n25.4%\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Albers\n\n\nstated on June 14, 2014 in In an emai to constituents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt would be illegal for the Fulton County Commission to raise the county tax rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy April Hunt \u2022 June 18, 2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n31.6%\n\n\n\n\nElected executive\n\n\n13.1%\n\n\n13.0%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\"The CEO form and the administrator form are both considered reforms from the traditional commission form of county government. So, in most states, any change is a change away from the commission form,\" Nelson told us via email.\nThe breakdown was done by the National Association of Counties.\nNelson told PolitiFact Georgia she had a more recent breakdown, but she hadn\u2019t had a chance to finish scrubbing the data for any potential errors.\nThe National Association of Counties released its latest such report in March 2009, based on data collected in 2008. Our state-by-state review of the report found that the commission form of government was used by about 42 percent of U.S. counties. Approximately 34 percent of counties use the administrator/manager form of government, while 21 percent have an elected executive form of government. The remaining 3 percent have miscellaneous forms of government.\nOur review of the 2009 report shows, as Nelson said, there is a decrease in the percentage of counties that currently use a traditional commission form of government. An elected executive form of government is also on the rise.\nIn Georgia, about two-thirds of the state\u2019s 159 counties use the administrator/manager form, according to the 2009 report.\n\"The transition has moved to more professional management and less traditional management,\" said Dave Willis, government relations manager of the Association County Commissioners of Georgia.\nMore counties are moving toward hiring an administrator because of the array of duties associated with operating a county government, said National Association of Counties spokesman Jim Phillips.\n\"As things get more complicated and counties have more services to provide, they move to an administrator instead of an elected board,\" he said.\nSome other metro Atlanta counties are having as much trouble as DeKalb concerning which form of government is best.\nIn Clayton, for example, commissioners decided in January to remove the county manager position, which gave Commission Chairman Jeff Turner more power. Turner hired a chief operating officer and a chief financial officer. By November, commissioners were talking about restoring the county manager position.\nIn Fulton County, leaders there have discussed elevating the commission chair's authority while making it tougher to fire the county manager. State lawmakers may take up both proposals in next year's legislative session, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution has reported.\nTo sum up, Nelson said at a DeKalb County town hall meeting on the current structure of county government that \"the commission form of government is definitely losing favor in the United States.\" Anecdotal information and the most comprehensive report on counties support her point.\nOur rating: True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-08453"}
