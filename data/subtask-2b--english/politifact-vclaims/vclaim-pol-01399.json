He's wrong", "text": "One of President Donald Trump\u2019s most significant achievements in office has been the elevation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. Trump took a victory lap during an Oct. 24 rally in Mosinee, Wis., reminiscing about the two justices he had nominated for the court, Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch.\n\"A lot of people say that's the most important decision a president can make,\" Trump said (at about the 25-minute mark in this video). \"Now, I would say war and peace. ... But it is a very, very important decision. And they are two great people and I'm very honored. You know, many presidents don't get a chance to put a Supreme Court justice on. Here we are less than two years and we put two of them on.\"\nWe wondered if Trump is right that \"many presidents don't get a chance to put a Supreme Court justice on.\"\nHe\u2019s not.\nWe looked at the full list of Supreme Court justices and found that only four presidents failed to nominate a justice during their tenure in the White House. Put another way, more than 90 percent of presidents have sent at least one justice to the court.\nAnd during the last 150 years, there has been only one such unlucky president.\nHere\u2019s the rundown of presidents who didn\u2019t get one of their nominations on the Supreme Court:\n\u2022 William Henry Harrison, the ninth president. Harrison died after serving only 31 days in office.\n\u2022 Zachary Taylor, the 12th president. Taylor died after serving a year and four months in office.\n\u2022 Andrew Johnson, the 17th president. Johnson succeeded the assassinated Abraham Lincoln and spent less than a full term in office.\n\u2022 Jimmy Carter, the 39th president. Carter served one term before losing reelection.\nPutting at least one justice on \"is not at all uncommon\" for a president, said Rutgers University presidential historian David Greenberg.\nHere\u2019s a list of post-World War II presidents and the number of successful Supreme Court appointments each had.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPresident\n\n\nNumber of Supreme Court justices placed\n\n\n\n\nHarry Truman\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\nDwight Eisenhower\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\nJohn F.
