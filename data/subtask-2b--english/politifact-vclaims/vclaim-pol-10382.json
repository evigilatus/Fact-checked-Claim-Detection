In truth, they were selected by a handful of party officials in Nashville in January every eight years.\"\n\nAlong the same lines: \"Proponents of popular elections say that a handful of politicians should not be selecting our highest 29 judges. They say the people ought to decide. Apparently they aren't aware, or just ignore, the fact that a handful of politicians selected the appellate judges before merit selection became law in 1971.\"\n\nDoes Summers have his history right?\n\nAsked to elaborate, Summers, the son of an appeals court judge, said in an interview that he had in mind relatively recent history and especially the process for selecting state Supreme Court judges.\n\nA bit of longer-term history may be in order, largely based on \"A History of the Tennessee Supreme Court\",published by the University of Tennessee Press in 2002. The book covers the period 1776-1998\nFrom statehood until 1854, the state Legislature appointed Tennessee's top judges. In the latter year, voters approved a constitutional amendment \u2013 initiated in the Legislature a year earlier \u2013 providing instead for popular election.\n\nThat remained the case until 1971, when the General Assembly approved a statute \u2013 not a constitutional amendment \u2013 setting up what was called the \"Modified Missouri Plan.\" The system calls for prospective judges to be screened by a commission, which then submits a list of names of the persons deemed best qualified to the governor. The governor then appoints the judge of his choice.\n\nBut two years later, with Republican Gov. Winfield Dunn in office and positioned to make appointments, the Democrat-controlled General Assembly repealed the new law insofar as applying to Supreme Court justices. It was left in effect for judges of the Court of Appeals and Court of Criminal Appeals.\n\nIn 1994, the General Assembly voted \u2013 again by enacting a statute \u2013 to put the Supreme Court back under the commission nominating/gubernatorial appointment process, making a few other relatively minor changes and calling the procedure \"the Tennessee plan.\"\n\nUnder the plan, when a judge's term ends after an appointment, he or she goes up for reelection on a yes-no basis. If a majority of voters statewide say yes in the \"retention election,\" the judge gets a new term.\n\nToday, the Tennessee Plan is still in effect \u2013 but possibly not for long. The Judicial Nominating Commission, which submits names to the governor, will cease to exist on June 30, 2013, unless the Legislature votes to extend its life before then. This comes with all appellate judge positions coming up in the eight-year cycle for a retention election cycle in August 2014. There are conflicting proposals \u2013 ranging from a constitutional amendment for a revised system to a return to contested elections \u2013 about what the Legislature should do next year.\n\nWhile the future of Tennessee judge selection is muddled, hindsight can be fairly clear.\n\nSummers says that, in writing his article, the standout case of judge selection by a \"handful of politicians\" came in 1990, when the state Democratic Party's 66-member Executive Committee chose a slate of five Supreme Court candidates for the party nomination.\n\nEarly in that year, two of the five incumbent Supreme Court justices stepped aside, reportedly after failing to gather enough political support among party activists on the Democratic Executive Committee. The Democratic nominees wound up being the only candidates on the ballot and were elected to full eight-year terms.\n\nThat was clearly a case where, as Summers states, a majority of the committee \u2013 34 of the 66 members, or a \"handful of party officials\" if you will \u2013 was able to choose Supreme Court justices.\n\nBut that was not always the case when partisan, contested elections were part of the picture.\n\nEight years before the 1990 scenario, the Republican party in 1982 put up a slate of three party nominees chosen by the Republican Executive Committee. The Democrats won in all the races.\n\nIn 1980, following the death of a sitting justice, then-Gov. Lamar Alexander appointed appointed George H. Brown of Memphis as Tennessee's first black member of the court. That set up a special election later in the year between Brown, as the Republican nominee, and the Democratic Executive Committee's nominee, Frank Drowota, and independent candidate Larry Parrish of Memphis, known as an anti-pornography crusader.\n\nDrowota won with 50 percent of the vote versus 38 percent for Brown and 12 percent for Parrish. Brown was one of the GOP nominees in the 1982 race, too.\n\nThere had also been a contested Supreme Court election in 1974, when Republicans nominated candidates for all five positions. They all lost.\n\nWith Democrats dominating the state, Republicans had apparently stopped trying in 1990. In today's political environment, Summers suggests that the Republican Executive Committee will pick the Supreme Court if there is a return to partisan elections.\n\nSummers also pointed out to us a speech by C.S. Carneyto the 1977 Tennessee Constitutional Convention, which drafted a constitutional amendment on judicial selection subsequently rejected by the voters. Carney had served as a Court of Appeals judge under the old system and won back his seat under the retention election system instituted in 1971.\n\nIn the speech, Carney criticized the partisan election system, saying it was dependent on political favor and not ability. Relative to this discussion, he also said there had been no exceptions to the rule of the Democratic Executive Committee picking Supreme Court justices since 1910.\n\nIn that year, though, there was an extraordinarily contested election. The Supreme Court had upheld a controversial murder conviction, only to have Gov. Malcolm Patterson pardon the killer. The ensuing uproar led to a split in Democratic ranks and qualifying a slate of \"independent\" Supreme Court candidates \u2013 and some for other appellate courts as well - backed by the splinter Democrats and Republicans. The independents won every seat and the related turmoil is widely credited as well for the election of a Republican, Ben Hooper, as governor. He was the last Republican to hold the office until Dunn, whose election led to enactment of the \"Modified Missouri plan\" in 1971.\n\nIt appears then, that appellate court were mostly selected by a relatively small number of politicians when the partisan election system was in place. But not always.\n\nIn 1910, in the 1970s and in the 1980s, top judicial elections were decided by voters who had a choice to override the decisions of that handful of politicians. So the voters ultimately decided in those cases, not the nominating committee.\n\nStill, that leaves party powers giving voters no choice from the years after Reconstruction \u2013 during which the judges were appointed by governors under federal oversight \u2013 up until 1910. And then again until the 1970s, as best we can tell.\n\nThat leaves us viewing Summers statement as Mostly True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGerald McCormick\n\n\nstated on January 19, 2012 in House floor debate over amending the state constitution to prohibit an income tax.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe state constitution \"clearly says there\u2019s not to be a state income tax in Tennessee.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Humphrey \u2022 February 9, 2012", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-10382"}
