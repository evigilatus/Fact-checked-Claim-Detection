That\u2019s a misleading claim circulating on a phony website.\n\"United Nations caught helping and coaching caravan illegal aliens!\" said the headline of a Nov. 22 post on usanetwork.info.\nThe website\u2019s banner USA Network and its internet address \u2014 usanetwork.info \u2014 seemingly attempts to masquerade as the TV channel USA Network. The internet address for the actual USA Network is usanetwork.com.\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe post\u2019s headline and story suggest that the United Nations has been exposed or outed for efforts to move the caravan along and into the United States. That\u2019s not true. The United Nations has provided assistance for migrants, and none of that has happened in a covert manner. The Mexican government in October asked for the United Nations\u2019 help to respond to the migrants\u2019 needs and immigration requests.\nThe UN\u2019s refugee agency, in line with its humanitarian mission, sent staff to Mexico to help authorities register asylum seekers, to help shelter migrants, and to set up \"identification and referral mechanisms for those with specific vulnerabilities and needs.\"\nThe United Nations has also said it\u2019s providing legal advice and counseling to people in the caravans. The organization considers it essential that migrants have a chance to request asylum and that their international protection needs are properly assessed before authorities send them back to their country of origin.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe USA Network post doesn\u2019t describe it that way.\n\"The United Nations was simply found in a compromising position helping the parade travel to the fringe,\" said the usanetwork.info post. \"What\u2019s more, now, UN authorities are training the unlawful vagrants on the best way to round out their refuge printed material!\"\nThe post falsely claims that the United Nations paid for transportation to speed up the caravan\u2019s movement in Mexico and toward the United States\u2019 southern border. (The United Nations declined a request from migrants for buses.) The website also argues in favor of cuts to financial assistance the United States provides the United Nations.\n\"The GOP is truly going to remunerate the UN with a huge number of American taxdol.lars! (sic) You should stop them!\" the post said. \"It would be ideal if you send your moment and ur.gent (sic) letter to Congress at this moment and FORCE them to safeguard Trump\u2019s slices to the United Nations and pass the American Sovereignty Restoration Act to cut whatever remains of the subsidizing!\"\nOur ruling\nA post on usanetwork.info says, \"United Nations caught helping and coaching caravan illegal aliens!\"\nThe United Nations has not been \"caught helping and coaching\" migrants in caravans wanting to come to the United States. The United Nations, openly, has provided humanitarian assistance and counseling to migrants. The organization has said that immigrants should be allowed to make asylum claims.\nThe post mischaracterizes the United Nations\u2019 actions.
