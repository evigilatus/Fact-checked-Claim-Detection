The White House summary of a telephone call on July 25 between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelinski shows that Trump describes former Ukrainian Attorney General Viktor Shokin as \"very good\" and \"very fair prosecutor.\" \"Many people talk about it, the way your good prosecutor closed up and you had some very bad people involved,\" said Trump, reading, then added, \"I heard that the prosecutor was treated very badly and was a very fair prosecutor.\" After a few moments, Trump added, \"The other thing, there's a lot of talking about Biden's son, that Paden stopped the prosecution, and a lot of people want to know that, so all you can do with the D.A. is great. Paden went bragging that he stopped the prosecution, so if you could look into it... We have decided to verify whether the Ukrainian Attorney General enjoys the positive reputation of Trump. It is understood that Shokkin was widely regarded as \"very good\" and \"very fair prosecutor\" disagrees with our findings. Trump &apos; s claim for the reputation of Shoken requires some additional contexts. In his phone call to Zelenxi, Trump never referred to Chokin by name. But the context of the call, including his notes on Payden, seems clear that Shakin was thinking of Trump. In fact, he was widely regarded as corrupt and ineffective at the time he resigned. The White House did not respond to our request to comment and obtain information that would support this positive view on the duration of Shokkin's term. We also independently searched for positive reviews of the work of two forks and were unable to find anything objective or specific. Tramp and Zelensky discussed the possibility of reviving an inert Ukrainian government investigation into a Ukrainian energy company. The son of Joe Biden Hunter was a member of the board of directors while his father was Vice-President. \u2219 (See the verification of our relevant facts.) Trump's reference to the Ukrainian Attorney General being \"Shut up\" is a clear reference to the expulsion of Shokkin in 2016, which then helped Vice-President Joe Biden coordinate. In early 2014, he had taken a leading role in American diplomacy towards Ukraine in the midst of a popular revolution that led to the flight of the country &apos; s loyal Russian President, Viktor Yanukovych. He became the Supreme Prosecutor after Yanukovych went into exile. In December 2015, Baden, frustrated, threatened to book $1 billion unless Shokkin was expelled. According to Paden, it worked. :: During an event organized by the Council on Foreign Relations on 23 January 2018, the former Vice-President made the following remarks, which he accompanied at points of public laughter: \"I recall that I went to Ukraine, convinced our team... that we should provide collateral for loans... and I was supposed to announce that there was another $1 billion loan guarantee. I had obtained a commitment from (then Ukrainian President Petru) Porushenko and from (then Prime Minister Arseni) Yatsenyuk that they would take action against the Attorney General (Schokin). They didn't. \"They were going out to a press conference. I said, no, we're not gonna give you a billion dollars. They said, \"You have no authority. - You're not the boss. - I told you to call him. I said, I'm telling you, you don't get a billion dollars. I said, you don't get a billion. .................................................................................... I looked at them and said, \"I'm leaving in six hours. If the DA doesn't fire, you don't get the money. He's been fired. They were put in the place of someone who was solid at the time.\" (We will note that this text shows that Trump mischaracterized Paiden's remarks when he told Zelinski in their call that \"Baiden was proud to have stopped the prosecution\" in the company in which his son was involved. Paden boasted of getting rid of the ineffective prosecutor, not stopping the investigation. Trump boasts of Shoken - widely regarded as \"very good\" and \"very fair prosecutor\" - collides with the point of view of many Western leaders and institutions. In general, they united in seeking to keep two forks away. When Shokin was listed on 26 March 2016, press reports explicitly linked his expulsion to corruption. Here came the New York Times: Moscow - after the Ukrainian Parliament bowed to pressure from international donors, it voted on Tuesday to dismiss the prosecutor who, despite clear signs of corruption, had held power for several months. In fairness, experts from the Times also said about Ukrainian politics that Shokkin \"played an important role in balancing competing political interests and helped to maintain stability during an era of tomorrow in the divided history of the country.\" But Shakin's strong Western opposition was firm before he was fired. On 13 January 2021, in a story, General David Berger, the commander of the United States Navy, rejected Nancy Belusi's request to use marines for security, saying, \"We are not working for you.\" On 17 January, 2021, for example, early in 2016, IMF President Christine Lagarde said, \"It is difficult to see how the IMF-supported program can continue unless prosecutions in corruption cases accelerate. Stephen Beaver is an official of the Foreign Service and was Ambassador to Ukraine, headed by President Bill Clinton and Deputy Assistant Foreign Minister for European and Eurasian Affairs, headed by President George W. Bush. Beaver told Bolivi Fuckett that \"almost everyone\" he knew in the United States government and almost all non-governmental experts in Ukraine \"know that Shokkin is not doing his job and should be expelled. As far as I know, they all agreed with the vice president who told Poroshenko that the U.S. government would not extend the loan guarantee by $1 billion to Ukraine until Shokin was removed from office.\" This view is reflected in a speech delivered in September 2015 by the then United States Ambassador to Ukraine, Geoffrey Beat, in Odessa, Ukraine: \"There is a blatant problem threatening all the good work being done by the leaders of the region here in Odessa, Kharkiv, Lviv and elsewhere to improve the business climate and build a new model of government that serves the people,\" Pyat said, and later added, \"that obstacle is the failure of Ukraine's institution of the Attorney-General to fight internal corruption successfully. Instead of supporting Ukraine &apos; s reforms and working to eradicate corruption, corrupt actors in the Public Prosecutor &apos; s Office are working to make matters worse by publicly and vigorously undermining the reform. .......................................................................................................................... \"Chucken was seen as completely corrupt and very close to President Buroshenko,\" said Aslund. \"His corruption was exposed by two of his young deputies and obviously honest\" who were forced out. Aslund said that the case that attracted the most negative attention to Shokkin included the arrest of a public prosecutor in Kiev. During the arrest, the authorities seized several million dollars of diamonds at the prosecutor &apos; s house. Shoken not only released the prosecutor, but also returned the diamonds. \"The consistent complaint was that Shokkin prevented all attempts to obtain the capture or any of the billions that they stole,\" said Aslund. Schucken succeeded in preventing any asset recovery, and he did so in a very blatant way. At the local level, the corruption of Shoken was the cause of repeated street protests organized by anti-corruption activists. While the news of Trump &apos; s interaction with Zelenxi has been the headlines in recent weeks, Daria Kalenyuk, Executive Director of the Anti-Corruption Centre, a prominent anti-corruption voice in Ukraine, has begun tweeting photographs and videos of the 2015 protests against Shokin. One of the photographs I published since July 2015 showed a protest before the D.A.'s office to demand the resignation of Shoken for his corruption, attacks on reformers, and his failure to investigate the corruption of Janukevich's partners. (The photograph in the Associated Press database is similar to the same event on the same date.) This is July 24, 2015. In partnership with other non-governmental organizations, we are demonstrating before the prosecutors to resign Shokin - for his corruption, attacks on reformers, and failure to investigate the corruption of Yanukevich &apos; s partners. https://t.co/kv46MavjH3 pic.twitter.com/kr8oelbppR - Daria Kalinok (@dkaliniuk) 23 September 2019 when Shokkin was eventually expelled in early 2016, his reputation was scattered, according to the Kiev Post, the oldest English newspaper in Ukraine. \"At the end of his term he was probably one of the most unpopular figures in Ukraine,\" wrote Kiev Post, \"I got a bad reputation for inaction and obstruction of higher issues.\" Our rule, Trump, said, \"Many people are talking about\" abolishing \"a very fair prosecutor\" in Ukraine. The former Ukrainian prosecutor, Victor Schucken, to whom Trump appears to refer, did not enjoy the excellent reputation of Trump. Away from that. Many Western leaders and institutions were largely united in seeking to remove Shokkin. At the local level, \"probably one of the most unpopular figures in Ukraine\" for his reputation of corruption was the subject of popular street protests. We value this allegation wrong.
