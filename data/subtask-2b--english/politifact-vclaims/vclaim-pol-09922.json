Kelly Ayotte.\n\nTargeting the same tax increases without any significant entitlement reforms, the proposal had the same tenets as Obama\u2019s last budget, according to Ayotte, New Hampshire\u2019s junior senator. And, unless the president comes up with something new, it\u2019s likely to meet a similar death, she said in an interview on CNN\u2019s State of the Union.\n\n\"I see (the proposal) as very disappointing,\" Ayotte told anchor Candy Crowley during the December 2 interview.\n\n\"(We have) a big problem in this country. That's why I didn't like seeing what was essentially a re-run of his budget that couldn't get support from either party in the House or the Senate. \u2026 It is time for us to come together and solve the big problems.\"\n\nObama\u2019s Fiscal Year 2013 budget proposal, introduced in February 2012 never reached the House floor for a vote. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it failed to get support from either side. We decided to take a closer look.\n\nWe must note that the president\u2019s budget proposal does not dictate federal spending. Rather, the proposal serves as a starting point for House and Senate lawmakers as they shape their own spending plans.\n\nSuch was the case for the president\u2019s $3.2 trillion proposal that the White House first unveiled onFeb. 13, 2012. Despite Ayotte\u2019s claim that the budget received no support from either party in the House or Senate, Obama\u2019s budget drew immediate praise from some leading Democrats.\n\n\"The President has put forth a budget that invests in job creation and economic growth in the short-term and gets our nation on a long-term, responsible path to fiscal sustainability,\" U.S. Rep. Chris Van Hollen, the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee, said at the time in a written statement.\n\n\"President Obama\u2019s budget would continue to move the nation in the right direction,\" U.S. Sen. Kent Conrad, a North Dakota Democrat and chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, added in a statement. \"For the near-term, it correctly focuses on strengthening the economy and creating jobs. That is the right near-term priority.\"\n\nThe next month, the House Budget Committee, led by U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, the future vice presidential nominee, countered with its own proposal, titled The Path to Prosperity.\n\nBefore House lawmakers acted on the Ryan budget, however, Republicans called for a vote on the President\u2019s spending plan in the form of House Amendment 999, sponsored by U.S. Rep. Mick Mulvaney, a South Carolina Republican.\n\nThe amendment, based on spending and revenue numbers from the president\u2019s budget, fell in the House 244-0, and, two months later, a similar motion, Concurrent Resolution 41, failed the Senate by a 99-0 count.\n\nReached for comment, Ayotte\u2019s staff referenced these two votes as support for her statement.\n\nRepublicans, both at the time and now, argue that the amendments mirrored the president\u2019s spending plans and the votes represented an indictment of the president and his spending plan.\n\n\"It is the President's budget. It has the numbers in it that the President had. They directly reflect the President's request,\" U.S. Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Alabama, the primary sponsor of the amendment, said as he presented the amendment on the Senate floor.\n\nBut, then as in now, Democratic opponents, analysts and news outlets called the amendments maneuvers and stunts intended to stir up opposition to the president and his budget.\n\nAt the time, the White House called the House amendment a \"gimmick,\" saying it intended to distract lawmakers from the damaging effects of the House Republicans\u2019 budget, according to an article printed in The Hill.\n\nAnd now, nine months later, political analysts continue to see the amendments as political stunts more than a meaningful action.\n\nIn both cases, the amendments were sponsored by Republican lawmakers who never intended them to pass, including only the final budget figures without any specific department breakdowns or tax policies, according to Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, a partnership between the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute.\n\n\"It\u2019s pure political maneuvering. Fairly simply,\" Williams said. \"The Republicans were the ones who brought it up. You know they didn't want to pass it. They do it for pure political reasons.\"\n\nFurther, without the political motives, Congress, the nation\u2019s budgeting authority, would not adopt the president\u2019s budget in fear of losing its autonomy, according to Stuart Kasdin, an assistant professor of public policy and public administration at George Washington University.\n\n\"That would be something like saying we're no longer able to govern ourselves, we just take what the president gives us,\" Kasdin said. \"Even if this weren't a politically charged environment, Congress would never start like that.\"\n\nAfter the amendment vote, the House went on to approve the House Republican budget proposal, which then stalled in the Democratic-led Senate. But, with the failed amendments, Republican lawmakers came away with a good talking point regarding the president\u2019s budget proposal heading into the fall election, analysts said.\n\n\"It\u2019s happened in past years \u2026 and it\u2019s never viewed as serious,\" said Paul Van de Water, a senior fellow at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. \"\n\n\"It\u2019s what we generally describe as votes that are designed to make some sort of a point, and then the other party always tries to avoid giving it any credibility by going along and having everybody vote it down,\" he said. \"But it certainly doesn't mean that the people who voted against it don\u2019t support the president\u2019s budget.\"\n\nOur ruling:\n\nLooking only at the votes taken on the House and Senate amendments, there\u2019s a kernel of truth to Ayotte\u2019s statement. Neither amendment earned a single vote from either party. However, these amendments represented only a skeleton of the president\u2019s budget, and the sponsors offered them to score political points, not for serious consideration.\n\nFurther, Ayotte said Obama\u2019s budget couldn\u2019t get \"support\" -- she never used the word \"votes.\" And the truth is Democrats in both the House and Senate showed plenty of support for Obama\u2019s $3.2 trillion budget plan by praising it when it was released.\n\nWe rate Ayotte\u2019s claim Mostly False.\n\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBarack Obama\n\n\nstated on October 8, 2012 in a campaign event outside Speaker John Boehner press conference in Derry, NH\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Mitt Romney plans to \"fire\" Big Bird.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Maryalice Gill \u2022 October 9, 2012", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-09922"}
