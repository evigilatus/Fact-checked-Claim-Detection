For Wisconsin it says, \"(President Donald) Trump won Wisconsin by 23,000 votes \u2026 in Milwaukee, 93,000 blacks didn\u2019t vote.\"\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\u00a0\nHere\u2019s what we found.\nClipped from the New York Times\nThe graphic is a screenshot from a Feb. 26, 2020, opinion piece in the New York Times by Karthik Balasubramanian, an information systems professor who worked for the Barack Obama campaigns in 2008 and 2012.\nThe numbers are consistent with the story, but they are presented without context.\u00a0\nThe various versions of the graphic we saw didn\u2019t include the header explaining this was based on the 2016 election \u2014 though that\u2019s implied by the Trump reference \u2014 or the statistical note that the data is based on metropolitan statistical areas (cities plus surrounding areas), not just cities as the labels on the graphic imply. Most were also missing the bottom state or two, presumably because they don\u2019t fit on a typical phone screen.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe victory margin figures are accurate.\nThe black turnout numbers are a little squishier. There isn\u2019t firm data on turnout by race since voter registration doesn\u2019t capture that data, so the figures on the right side of the graphic are an estimate based on a U.S. Census Bureau survey that breaks down race and voter participation by state and the demographic makeup of each city.\nNationwide, the Census found black voter turnout was 59.6% in 2016, down sharply from 66.6% in 2012 \u2014 and the lowest black turnout rate since 2000.\nThe 2016 rate was lower than white voters (65.3% of whom turned out) but higher than other minority groups. In 2012, black voters had a higher turnout than white voters for the first time, according to the Census.\u00a0\nOf course, many people of other races did not vote as well, but the thrust of the message was to boost African American turnout in the 2020 election.\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post says Trump won Wisconsin by 23,000 votes, while in Milwaukee alone 93,000 blacks didn\u2019t vote.\nIt makes a similar comparison for a series of other states decided by close margins in 2016, including Florida, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\nThose numbers are in line with what the story reported. But the screenshotted graphic leaves off the statistical detail that the numbers include the surrounding area for each city, and doesn\u2019t specify that these numbers reflect only 2016.\nWe rate this claim Mostly True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-18163"}
