Ron Paul, R-Texas, sought to put some blemishes on Perry\u2019s record by noting that many of the new jobs were in the government.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nCNN anchor Wolf Blitzer, the debate moderator, began the exchange by asking Paul about Perry\u2019s claims of economic success in the Lone Star State. \"You\u2019re from Texas,\" Blitzer said. \"Does your governor deserve all that credit?\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nPaul answered, \"Not quite. I\u2019m a taxpayer there. My taxes have gone up. Our taxes have doubled since he\u2019s been in office. Our spending has gone up double. Our debt has gone up nearly triple. So, no. And 170,000 of the jobs were government jobs. So I would put a little damper on this, but I don\u2019t want to offend the governor, because he might raise my taxes or something.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nFor this item, we\u2019re looking exclusively at Paul\u2019s claim that \"170,000 of the jobs\" created in Texas under Perry \"were government jobs.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWe turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the official federal source of employment data for the nation, states and localities. We looked at government job growth during Perry\u2019s tenure, from January 2001 to July 2011:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nState government jobs: Increase of 49,100, or about 4,600 per year of Perry\u2019s tenure\nLocal government jobs: Increase of 217,600, or about 20,700 per year\nFederal government jobs: Increase of 19,700, or about 1,900 per year\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nTotal government jobs: Increase of 286,400, or about 27,300 per year\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nMeanwhile, Texas employment overall increased over this period by 1,078,600, or about 102,700 per year.\n\nLooking at it a different way, the number of local government jobs has increased by 21 percent during Perry\u2019s tenure, while state government jobs have expanded at a 15 percent clip.\n\nLet's put all of this in perspective. The increase in state government jobs represented about 4 percent of Texas\u2019 total jobs increase; for local government jobs, it was 20 percent; for federal jobs, it was less than 2 percent.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWe see a few different ways to analyze these numbers.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nFirst, in critiquing Perry, not all government jobs are created equal. Perry has the most direct influence over the growth in state jobs. His influence on local government jobs is weaker. And he has relatively little influence in securing federal job increases. (Indeed, given his theme that the feds are overreaching, he might very well want fewer federal employees.)\n\nHow big is Perry\u2019s sway over local government jobs? We checked with representatives of cities and counties, and they agreed that it is pretty limited.\n\nCities get about 36 percent of their funds from property taxes, 29 percent from sales taxes and much of the rest from items such as fines, right-of-way rentals and user fees, said Bennett Sandlin, executive director of the Texas Municipal League, which represents 1,100 Texas cities. Those sorts of income streams are not affected by the governor to any significant degree.\n\nCounties, similarly, are \"highly reliant on the property tax,\" said Elna Christopher, a spokeswoman for the Texas Association of Counties. She said that state mandates can affect county employment numbers, particularly because a jail standards commission sets required ratios between prison inmates and correctional-officers. But while the governor appoints the commissioners, he doesn\u2019t directly influence their deliberations.\n\nThis leaves one major area: the public schools. The state government does have significant influence over education budgets -- and most recently, this impact has been to shrink rather than increase. Earlier this year, Perry and the legislature decided to fund school districts by $4 billion less in 2012-13 than existing formulas would have provided.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan Rachel\n\n\nstated on January 16, 2021 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $15-per-hour minimum wage would raise the price of a Taco Bell burrito to $38.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd during Perry\u2019s tenure, local education jobs -- which Perry would have the most influence over -- have increased at a slower rate than local government jobs as a whole. Local education jobs have risen at about 11 percent, while non-educational local government jobs have risen by 37 percent.\n\nSo with the government jobs Perry can affect the most -- state jobs -- the raw-number increase was well below what Paul claimed. Only if you use a more expansive definition of government jobs -- including jobs Perry doesn\u2019t have much of an impact on -- is the increase bigger than what Paul claimed.\n\nHaving said that, the increase in total government jobs under Perry is not trivial. State government jobs represented 4 percent of the overall increase for all types of jobs, but the combination of all government jobs accounted for nearly 27 percent. And if you look at government jobs as a percentage of all jobs in Texas, the share has risen from 16.4 percent at the start of Perry\u2019s tenure to 17.5 percent today.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAnd here\u2019s one more factor to consider: As state and local government jobs were increasing, so was the state's population -- more rapidly than anywhere in the nation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nBetween mid 2001 and mid 2010, Texas\u2019 population increased by a whopping 20 percent. The growth in local government jobs -- 21 percent -- roughly kept pace with that growth, while state government jobs increased at a somewhat slower pace, 15 percent.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nBoth growth rates were faster than the national average. Nationally, local and state government jobs both grew by slightly under 6 percent during the same period.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nOur ruling\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWe can\u2019t find an exact match for Paul\u2019s 170,000 figure in the official statistics, and getting to that number requires not just state jobs, but also local government jobs that Perry would have had difficulty influencing.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nStill, there's some truth in Paul\u2019s underlying claim that a notable share of the job growth Perry touts on the campaign trail came from government jobs. Even leaving out federal jobs, about one out of every four new jobs in Texas during Perry\u2019s tenure has been a new state or local government job. So while Paul is wrong on the specific numbers, he makes a larger point with some merit. We\u2019ll call it Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-12422"}
