John Kasich is using the economic turnaround in Ohio to help make his case for president.\nIn a recent interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity, Kasich touted the state\u2019s credit rating as part of his success story.\n\"Guess what, our credit -- up. Think about our pensions -- solid,\" Kasich said.\n\"What\u2019s your credit rating?\" Hannity asked.\n\"It\u2019s as high as you can get, AA+,\" Kasich responded.\n\"What about AAA?\" Hannity asked.\n\"I don\u2019t think you can really get to AAA,\" Kasich said,\nIs AA+ the highest credit rating a state could receive? That sounded dubious to us, so we wanted to investigate.\nFor this analysis, we\u2019re focusing on the state\u2019s general obligation bond rating -- that is, an expert analysis of a state\u2019s ability to pay its debts.This rating, which is kind of like a person\u2019s credit score, is formulated by three major rating agencies: Standard & Poor\u2019s Rating Services, Moody\u2019s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings.\nNeither Kasich\u2019s campaign nor the governor\u2019s office responded to us by our deadline.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Evers\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in Speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We put $330 million in general school aids \u2014 the largest in more than a decade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Haley BeMiller \u2022 January 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStandard and Poor\u2019s sent PolitiFact Ohio its entire history of U.S. state ratings. The history shows when Ohio was first rated, in 1984, it earned AA, and it held there until upgrading to AA+ in 1996.\nS&P has an additional, forward-looking catagory for ratings which include \"negative,\" \"stable,\" and positive,\" and while Ohio has cycled through \"stable\" to \"negative\" twice in recent history (the outlook was \"negative\" in 2002 and again in 2009), the AA+ rating has remained unchanged for 20 years.\nCritical to Kasich\u2019s claim, S&P indeed has a AAA credit rating. And several states have the highest mark.\nAlaska, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Maryland, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming -- are all rated AAA, according to S&P. Three of those states -- Missouri, North Carolina and Virginia -- have held their perfect scores for 50 years or more.\nFor the record, Moody\u2019s and Fitch also issues AAA ratings.\nDon Chance, a professor of finance at Louisiana State University, said it\u2019s impressive for a state government to maintain a positive credit rating in difficult economic times. But, on the merits of the claim, Kasich is clearly mistaken.\n\"I think he probably got caught up in the moment, caught up reeling off the bullet points,\" Chance said, noting that Kasich previously worked at Lehman Brothers.\nOur ruling\nKasich said on Fox News that his state of Ohio earned the highest possible credit rating, at AA+. When host Hannity asked about a AAA rating, Kasich said, \"I don\u2019t think you can really get to AAA.\"\nIn fact, you can, and 15 other states currently hold a AAA credit rating, according to S&P.\nWe rate this statement False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05444"}
