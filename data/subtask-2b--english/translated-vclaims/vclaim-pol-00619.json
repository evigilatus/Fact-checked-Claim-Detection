She cited the mental health difficulties faced by farmers and veterans, and told the story of her father's struggle with alcohol addiction. She summarized this by telling her audience that \"there has been a 30% increase in suicides in this country in only 15 years.\" (It's about 25:00.) This is a significant increase. Is she right? We didn't hear a response from her campaign, but we found data supporting the statistics. An overview of the figures on the suicide data home page of the National Institute of Mental Health website includes data on the suicide rate between 2001 and 2017 - over 16 years, but close enough for our purposes. Data have been collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. To analyse the Clobochar statement, we used the national suicide rate - the number of suicides per 100,000 people - instead of the initial numbers of suicides, because the use of the rate factors outside any increases is simply due to population growth. In addition, the CDC figures are \"age-adjusted\" - a statistical process that eliminates differences in the age of the population for better comparisons from year to year. On January 31, 2021, Ryan Fornier stated on Twitter \"Biden's administration lost 20 million COVID vaccines.\" That's a 30.8% increase, put Klobochar on target. Why does the suicide rate rise steadily? Part of the reason for this increase may stem from improved reporting of suicides, following the implementation of the National System for Reporting Violent Deaths of the Centre for Disease Control, as stated by Carol W. Ronian, a professor of epidemiology and community and behavioural health at the Colorado School of Public Health. However, researchers believed that there were also substantial reasons. \"Maybe it's a combination of things, including inadequate access to good mental health care, increased access to weapons -- which are the deadliest means of attempted suicide -- drugs, as well as social factors related to depression,\" said Ronian. \"We've got 30% increase in suicides in this country in only 15 years.\" Between 2001 and 2017, the suicide rate increased by exactly 30.8 per cent. We're assessing her statement right.
