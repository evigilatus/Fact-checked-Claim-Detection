But it's true that in the 1950s, the top\n\nmarginal\n\ntax rates were over 90 percent.\n\n\nSo does that mean that someone in 1955 making a half million dollars had to fork over $450,000 of it to Uncle Sam? No.\n\n\nWe are talking here about \"marginal\" tax rates. Moore doesn't go out of his way to explain this, so we will. The marginal tax rate is the top rate of income tax charged to individuals on their last dollar of earnings. So in 1955, for example, when the top marginal tax rate was 91 percent, that was the tax rate owed on a person's income over $300,000. That person would, however, pay 20 percent on the first $2,000 of income; 21 percent on the next $2,000 in income; 24 percent on the next $2,000 and graduated on up to the highest rate. On average, a person making, say, $500,000 would pay substantially less than 90 percent of their income in federal taxes.\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

According to Williams, someone would have to make $2,328,400, and therefore pay $2,095,560, to get to that 90 percent threshold.\n\n\nBut people with income of less than $2.3 million \u2014 remember we're talking about 1952 and 1953 \u2014 would have paid, on average, something less than 90 percent, and perhaps much less.\n\n\nStill, Moore's point is valid. The top marginal tax rates paid by the richest Americans were far higher in the 1950s than they are now. In 2009, the top marginal rate was 35 percent on income above $372,958. And although Moore didn't use the term \"marginal tax rate,\" he did say \"top tax rate.\" People without CPAs might mistake that for a person's average tax rate (it's not), but it's valid wording.
