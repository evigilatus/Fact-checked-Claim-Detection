The theory is that terrorist groups such as Al-Qaida and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria can mobilize their potential followers by highlighting alleged human rights violations against suspected terrorists in prison. But Chief Editor Wickley Standard said it was wrong. Guantanamo \"has never been a key element in ISIS or Al-Qaida propaganda, yet the President insists on moving forward and closing it,\" Hayes said in Fox News on Sunday, 27 December. We decided to get down to the bottom of this question. When we contacted Hayes, he said there was no doubt that Guantanamo appeared in some terrorist propaganda, but stressed that it was not a \"main ingredient.\" The experts with whom we spoke are generally agreed. Hayes referred to us as Thomas Jocelyn, his senior colleague at the Foundation for the Defence of Democracies and a counter-terrorism expert. \"Guantanamo plays a petty role in the propaganda of jihadists\" told Jocelyn Bondit Fuckett. \"Really rare\" Jocelyn &apos; s conclusion is based on statistical analyses of the key words used in ISIS and Al-Qaida propaganda, which he has followed closely over the past decade. Over the years, it has compiled a database of multilingual messages, videos, sound data records and publications, mostly in Arabic. For example, Jocelyn found only four references to Guantanamo out of twelve issues, or more than 700 pages in English, of ISIL &apos; s monthly Dubai magazine. One article did not include Guantanamo as the main topic. None of these four data was mentioned in the context of recruitment; one of them was in a footnote. There are other issues that dominate, such as the war against the Zionists-Crosseders, which establishes the succession, the fate of Palestine, the United States military air attacks targeting ISIS, and the United States occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan. Researchers at the Brookings Institution also conducted an analysis of terrorist propaganda earlier in 2015 and published their findings in the prestigious Code of Law. Although their review contained only English language material or translation, they reached a similar conclusion to Jocelyn's conclusion. In sum, the authors found that the Islamic State rarely used Guant\u00e1namo as a propaganda tool, and that Al-Qaida used prison at a much lower rate than it had previously used, although the group did not use it much at first. When the Guantanamo groups were mentioned, they were often included alongside other controversial facilities, such as Abu Ghraib prison, which had now been lost, and other grievances concerning the United States. He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. The authors wrote through Bill McCarthy: January 12, 2021, \"Guantanamo never played a significant role in propaganda for any terrorist group compared to the issues that really raise them.\" \"So while it is easy to find examples of terrorist leaders mentioning and condemning Guant\u00e1namo, these were not the main subjects of jihadist propaganda, but, at the very most, supporting arguments.\" One expert told us that Hayes' claim is exaggerated. Max Abrams, Professor of Political Science at Northeastern University, said that Hayes underestimated the importance of Guantanamo in advertising. For example, Al-Qaida &apos; s Inspiration magazine highlighted this prison prominently, such as the autumn 2010 issue, which included accounts from former detainees. He added that in the video recently broadcast by ISIL on a large scale in the social media, terrorists often wore orange clothes for hostages, which many believed was a reference to the uniform taken from Guant\u00e1namo detainees. Jocelyn challenged this argument, stating that many prisons use a similar costume and that Guantanamo no longer uses that uniform. Moreover, these videos called \"Jehadi John\" Guantanamo are rarely mentioned. The orange jumpsuit is likely to be a visual signal to Abu Ghraib, rather than Guantanamo, dating back to the first video of the head chopping by Al-Qaida in Iraq, as J. M. Hey, burger, non-resident in Brookings. In any case, Guantanamo is not necessarily an effective instrument of recruitment, as Abrahams added. In fact, they may be less valuable in terms of publicity now than they were in the past because Guantanamo was associated with President George W. Bush, while Obama is widely known to want to close the prison. The general theme of Muslim religious and political prisoners is popular among jihadists and can be used for recruitment, as Berger, the author of Ju Jihad, said: Americans at war in the name of Islam and ISIS: the state of terrorism. Members of terrorist groups can monitor social media accounts and relevant websites in search of potential recruits. For example, a former Guantanamo detainee runs one of the most important English-language websites on this subject, the London-based Islamic Prisoners &apos; Advocacy Site, the CAGE site, which covers some issues related to Guantanamo. \"Guantanamo was not a major focus in jihadist propaganda, but appears in recruitment,\" said Berger. \"Assault and al-Qa'idah recruiters can use it as a matter of collision when approaching a completely non-extremist person.\" However, United States counter-terrorism actions, particularly drone strikes, were certainly more important for recruitment and certainly more important for propaganda than Guant\u00e1namo. Governor Hayes, Guant\u00e1namo, said, \"It has never been a major component of ISIS or Al-Qaida propaganda.\" The experts told us that Hayes' point of view is worthwhile. Analysis of jihadist propaganda shows that Guantanamo is rarely mentioned, especially in comparison with other complaints against the United States, such as military air strikes. The base uses Guantanamo less frequently now than it used, although it has never been a major focus of its propaganda. Because it was determined that Guantanamo is not a \"key component\" of jihadist propaganda, we evaluate Hayes' statement correctly.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05583"}
