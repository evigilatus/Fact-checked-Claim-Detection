According to the foundation, in 2011, 24 of the top 50 venture-backed businesses also had a least one foreign-born founder.\nExperts we spoke with generally agreed with Clinton\u2019s claim. Although, there are some caveats.\nUniversity of California, Santa Cruz economics professor Robert Fairlie, who authored a 2012 paper for the Small Business Administration on immigrant entrepreneurs, said that the success of these businesses is not as clear as the start-up data.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Cotton\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in a Fox & Friends interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these migrants that are coming, we have no way to screen their backgrounds for either health or for security.\"\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Miriam Valverde \u2022 February 3, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"My estimates show that immigrants have a much higher business start rate than non-immigrants,\" Fairlie said. \"There is also evidence showing that immigrant businesses are smaller on average than non-immigrant businesses.\"\nA 2011 report from the bipartisan Partnership for a New American Economy notes that 40 percent of Fortune 500 companies are founded by an immigrant or the child of an immigrant. Although, when the former CEO of AOL repeated this claim, we rated it Half True -- a company\u2019s dominance could be more attributable to recent leaders more so than its founders.\nHowever, Clinton\u2019s claim was not as definitive.\n\"Immigrants are indeed more likely than others to be business owners,\" said David Kallick, a senior fellow at the Fiscal Policy Institute. \"The claims about business ownership are sometimes overstated, but from the Vox quote, I\u2019d say Hillary is on the mark.\"\nSteven Camarota, director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for stricter immigration policies, analyzed the Census Bureau\u2019s 2015 Current Population Survey self-employment data by country for immigrants and natives.\nHe found that immigrants from some countries, such as Brazil and Germany, do have higher business ownership rates than natives. But immigrants from other countries do not.\nCamarota said it is possible they start businesses at higher rates than natives, but \"they fail at higher rates, too.\"\nBut, Colgate University economics professor Chad Sparber, an immigration economy expert, said Clinton\u2019s claim is accurate, noting that federal data shows that immigrants are \"almost always more likely\" to be self-employed than natives.\n\"Though, self-employment isn\u2019t necessarily the same thing as starting a business,\" Sparber said.\nOur ruling\nClinton said, \"immigrants start businesses at a faster rate; they seem to grow those businesses more successfully.\"\nFederal data and the experts we spoke with back up her claim. While it\u2019s important to note that evidence on the success of immigrant-owned businesses is limited, what we did find supports what Clinton said, that immigrants \"seem\" to grow their businesses better than their native counterparts.\nWe rate Clinton\u2019s claim Mostly True.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9e394b49-c56d-49c0-8cc7-46eb68e4e919", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04591"}
