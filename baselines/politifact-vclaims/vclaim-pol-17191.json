Kenosha County District Attorney Michael Graveley said as a result the officer who shot Blake could successfully argue self-defense, and therefore wouldn\u2019t face criminal charges. That does not affect the rating for this item because ratings are based on what is known at the time. When this statement was made in August 2020, it was not clear what Blake was holding or when, given the grainy cell phone video and lack of detail released by police.\nAs we wait for a full Wisconsin Department of Justice report on the Jacob Blake shooting, speculation has run rampant online about whether the 29-year-old Kenosha man was armed \u2014 and with what \u2014 in the moments before a Kenosha police officer shot him seven times in the back.\nThe lack of detailed information from law enforcement has only added to the speculation.\nThat includes a widely shared Aug. 26, 2020, Facebook post that starts out blaring \"FACTS MATTER!!\" before asserting this:\n\"Jacob Blake declared he had a gun in the car and was going to go get it. He continued to brandish the knife while disregarding officer commands. When he reached into the car, officers fired. This is why they are burning down Kenosha, Wisconsin right now.\"\nIt was accompanied by a screen grab from an onlooker\u2019s video of Blake, where an object in his hand is circled.\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook).\nHere\u2019s what we know.\nThere was no gun\nThe Facebook post avoids directly claiming a gun, instead attributing statements to Blake about having and getting a gun.\nWe don\u2019t know what was said, and we may never know since the responding officers weren\u2019t wearing body cameras. The Kenosha Police Department doesn\u2019t use them. Audio in the cell-phone video shot by a witness is hard to discern due to bystanders\u2019 shouts.\nSo there\u2019s no way to prove this part of the claim directly \u2014 though no witness reports have emerged since the incident that offer this account. The man who made the Facebook post did not respond to a request for the evidence behind the claim.\nBut we know there was no gun.\nAn Aug. 26, 2020, news release from the Department of Justice said officers found a knife on the driver\u2019s side floorboard, but \"a search of the vehicle located no additional weapons.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevin LeMahieu\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a TV interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It takes quite a while on Election Day to load those ballots, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Eric Litke \u2022 January 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnife involvement still ambiguous\nThe role of the knife is much less clear.\nThe DOJ has not clarified whether the knife was on the floorboard throughout the confrontation, or if Blake may have held it at some point. Spokeswoman Gillian Drummond declined to answer that question when asked by PolitiFact Wisconsin on Aug. 27, 2020.\nVideo taken by onlookers shows something in Blake\u2019s hand, but the resolution is low, so it could be a knife, sunglasses or something else.\nThe man who said he made the widely shared cellphone video of the shooting, 22-year-old Raysean White, told the Associated Press he heard officers yell, \"Drop the knife! Drop the knife!\" as they scuffled with Blake before the shooting.\u00a0\nWhite said he didn\u2019t see a knife in Blake\u2019s hands.\nThe audio captured by White is inconclusive, though there is a phrase or two that could be interpreted as, \"Drop the knife.\"\nBlake\u2019s representatives have said he was unarmed. His father told the Chicago Sun-Times for an Aug. 25, 2020, story, \"My son didn\u2019t have a weapon. He didn\u2019t have a gun.\"\u00a0\nBlake\u2019s attorney, Ben Crump, said in a statement released Aug. 27, 2020, \"Jacob did nothing to provoke police. \u2026 Witnesses confirm that he was not in possession of a knife and didn\u2019t threaten officers in any way.\" But another attorney representing the Blake family, Patrick Salvi Jr., had told CNN the day before that Blake didn\u2019t have a weapon in the vehicle, which turned out to not be true.\nWhat we do know is that referring to Blake as \"brandishing\" appears to be an exaggeration.\nVideo of the shooting shows Blake walking around the front of the car with his back to officers and his left arm swinging at his side, grasping some object.\u00a0\nBrandishing is defined by Merriam-Webster as \"to shake or wave (something, such as a weapon) menacingly.\" That\u2019s not what the video shows.\nOur ruling\nA viral Facebook post says Blake \"declared he had a gun in the car and was going to go get it\" and was \"brandishing\" a knife.\nWe have no way of knowing for sure what Blake said, but we know there was no gun. And we don\u2019t yet know if the knife police later found in the SUV was there throughout the confrontation or held by Blake at some point. But Blake was not \"brandishing\" anything in the video taken by bystanders.\nFor our fact checks, the burden of proof is on the speaker. Due to the lack of evidence establishing these claims at this point, we rate this claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-17191"}
