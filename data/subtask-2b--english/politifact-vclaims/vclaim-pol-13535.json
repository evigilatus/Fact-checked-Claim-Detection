A shutdown typically prevents federal agencies from carrying out any functions deemed non-essential.\n\nA shutdown last occurred in the mid 1990s, when President Bill Clinton squared off against a new Republican majority in the House and Senate. That led to two shutdowns -- one for five days in November 1995 and the other for 21 days from December 1995 to January 1996.\n\nDuring the past 15 years, lawmakers and the president, despite frequent turbulence, have always managed to come to an agreement on funding bills. But the streak could come to an end this year.\n\nAt a Feb. 15, 2011, press conference, a reporter asked Obama whether he was willing to work with Congressional Republicans \"to avoid a government shutdown?\"\n\nHere\u2019s part of Obama\u2019s answer:\n\n\"We\u2019ve got to be careful. Again, let\u2019s use a scalpel; let\u2019s not use a machete. And if we do that, there should be no reason at all for a government shutdown. And I think people should be careful about being too loose in terms of talking about a government shutdown, because this has -- this is not an abstraction. People don\u2019t get their Social Security checks. They don\u2019t get their veterans payments. Basic functions shut down. And it -- that, also, would have an adverse effect on our economic recovery. It would be destabilizing at a time when, I think, everybody is hopeful that we can start growing this economy quicker.\"\n\nA reader asked us to explore whether it was true that Americans won\u2019t get their Social Security checks if the government shuts down.\n\nFirst, some background about the laws that govern shutdowns, from a recent briefing paper by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.\n\nThe Constitution (Article I, Sec. 9) says, \"No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.\" This is reinforced by the Antideficiency Act, which stems from an 1870 law and which has been revised significantly over the years. That act prohibits federal officials from spending money before an appropriations measure has been enacted, though exceptions exist for \"emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property.\"\n\nBut when looking at the fate of Social Security during a government shutdown, there\u2019s an important wrinkle to remember.\n\nSocial Security is a mandatory program supported by a trust fund. As such, Social Security benefits aren\u2019t appropriated -- and thus aren\u2019t directly subject to the restrictions of the Antideficiency Act. However, the Social Security Administration\u2019s operational employees are paid through appropriated funds. So the real question is whether a shutdown would prevent those employees from going to work, and if so, whether that would mean the payments wouldn't be sent.\n\nA 1981 attorney general's opinion protects the right of at least some Social Security workers to carry out necessary functions -- and that\u2019s essentially what happened during the 1995 shutdowns.\n\nAccording to Social Security's official history on its website, 4,780 employees remained at work at the start of the four-day shutdown, while the other 61,415 were furloughed. But this cut \"significantly impacted the Agency\u2019s service to the public,\" the account said, and on the second day, additional employees were recalled to work.\n\nThe second shutdown -- which lasted three weeks, the longest in history -- could have brought even more severe consequences. But the agency deployed 55,000 employees and operations remained close to normal. (Experts told us it\u2019s possible that the agency could get by with fewer employees today than in 1995 because today, many Social Security benefits are paid electronically.)\n\nSo, in 1995, the bottom line was that checks went out pretty much as they were supposed to. Does that mean they will if there\u2019s a shutdown this year?\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Jay Carney addressed the question during his Feb. 24, 2011, press briefing. Asked by a reporter why checks might not go out in 2011 like they did in 1995, Carney suggested that at least some beneficiaries may not be able to receive adequate customer services during a shutdown due to workers being furloughed.\n\n\"The president was pointing out some of the consequences, the potential consequences of failing to act, of failing to prevent a shutdown,\" Carney said. \"And some recipients, new retirees, new applicants might not receive their checks. If retirees have questions about their checks, if they didn't get their check in the mail, if they had a change of address, all those things could prevent them from getting their checks. So there are, obviously, consequences that directly affect people who are recipients of Social Security benefits.\"\n\nThis statement -- which is noticeably more nuanced than Obama\u2019s original comment -- comes close to the assessments of experts we spoke to. They told us it\u2019s likely that payments will once again be made -- but there\u2019s no guarantee. As CRS put it, while \"past experience may inform future OMB and agency decisions,\" past precedents on activities and personnel \"would not necessarily hold for any future shutdown.\"\n\nExperts told us that there is enough of a gray area that it\u2019s impossible to say with certainty that checks will go out during the next shutdown.\n\nThe president and Congress \"could decide whether to send out Social Security checks in the event of a shutdown,\" said Alice Rivlin, who headed OMB under Clinton. \"Congress could mandate that enough workers be declared 'essential' to get the checks out or the president could decide to take that action\u2014or not.\"\n\nJohn Palguta, a former federal official who is now vice president for policy at the Partnership for Public Service, agreed, saying that it\u2019s \"probable\" that Social Security payments will continue, but added that \"it\u2019s not an iron-clad guarantee.\"\n\nSo at the very least, we believe there\u2019s considerably more uncertainty on this issue than Obama stated in the news conference. While Obama had said that if there\u2019s a government shutdown, \"people don\u2019t get their Social Security checks,\" the reality is that the law provides significant leeway for employing federal workers to carry out Social Security functions during a shutdown, which allowed most checks to go out in 1995.\n\nOn the other hand, making that approach work depends on the president utilizing his authority, and on Congress not blocking him from carrying it out. It\u2019s also possible, as Carney suggests, that depending on the number of Social Security employees assigned to work, certain customer services may become unavailable during a shutdown, such as checks not going out to new beneficiaries or those with address changes.\n\nUltimately, the law and history suggest that it\u2019s likely that checks will go out, though it\u2019s not a certainty. On balance, we rate Obama\u2019s statement Barely True.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen. David H.
