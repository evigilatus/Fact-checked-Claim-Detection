Ted Cruz, R-Texas, has attracted national attention for his rhetoric. On Sept. 9, 2014, Cruz gave a stemwinder of a floor speech, criticizing a proposed constitutional amendment backed by Democrats.\nThe backers of the proposed amendment, S.J.Res.19, say it\u2019s intended to overturn Citizens United, the Supreme Court decision that loosened campaign-finance laws for corporations. They argue that the court\u2019s ruling has opened a floodgate of campaign spending that threatens the democratic process.\nCruz, however, argues that the proposed amendment severely threatens First Amendment protections that date back more than two centuries.\nPerhaps the most attention-getting portion of Cruz\u2019s lengthy speech (which you can read in its entirety here) came when he suggested that Lorne Michaels, the executive producer of NBC\u2019s long-running show Saturday Night Live, would be put at risk of imprisonment if the amendment were enacted:\n\"When I asked the senator from Minnesota (Al Franken, a former Saturday Night Live writer and actor) in the Senate Judiciary Committee, \u2018Do you believe that Congress should have the constitutional authority to prohibit Saturday Night Live from making fun of politicians, the good senator promptly reassured me he had no intention of doing any such thing. But what we are debating is not the intentions of 100 senators. What we are debating is a constitutional amendment that 49 Democrats are proposing to be inserted into the Bill of Rights. ...\n\"What the amendment says is for any corporation, Congress would have the constitutional authority to prohibit it from engaging in political speech. Well, NBC, which airs Saturday Night Live, is a corporation. \u2026 \u00a0Congress would have the power to make it a criminal offense. Lorne Michaels could be put in jail under this amendment for making fun of any politician.\"\nPolitical observers expect the amendment to fall well short of the two-thirds vote in the Senate that would be required before it went to the House (where it would need a two-thirds vote) and the states (where it would need to be ratified by three-fourths of the states). So the fears Cruz expresses are probably moot.\nStill, many readers asked us to take a closer look at Cruz\u2019s claim about Lorne Michaels and Saturday Night Live. \nWhat the amendment says\nLet\u2019s start by looking at the proposed amendment. Here are the key passages:\n\"Congress and the States may regulate and set reasonable limits on the raising and spending of money by candidates and others to influence elections. \u2026 Congress and the States shall have power to implement and enforce this article by appropriate legislation, and may distinguish between natural persons and corporations or other artificial entities created by law, including by prohibiting such entities from spending money to influence elections. \u2026 \u00a0Nothing in this article shall be construed to grant Congress or the States the power to abridge the freedom of the press.\"\nCruz\u2019s argument\nCruz, both in his speech and in a subsequent telephone interview with PolitiFact, made the case for why Michaels might have reason to worry for his freedom if the amendment were to be ratified. Among his points:\n\u2022 Reading the amendment literally, the SNL scenario closely fits its language. That is, a corporation (NBC) is spending money (to produce and air SNL) that could influence an election (it arguably has in the past, as in its characterization of 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin).\n\"By any measure, NBC is a corporation,\" Cruz said in the interview. \"And the amendment says the government can prohibit such entities from spending money to influence elections.\"\nIn fact, Cruz also argued in the speech and the interview that a literal reading of the amendment also would permit restrictions on the speech of entities as diverse as movie studio Paramount Pictures, publisher Simon and Schuster, the NAACP, the National Council of La Raza, and the Sierra Club. \"Every one of these is a corporation,\" Cruz said.\n\u2022 SNL is unlikely to benefit from the proposal\u2019s press-freedom exemption. While the amendment contains an exemption for freedom of the press, SNL is an entertainment show, Cruz noted, not part of NBC\u2019s news division. \"I agree (the amendment) carves out a specific press exemption, but SNL is by no measure the press,\" Cruz told PolitiFact.\n\u2022 It doesn\u2019t matter that the amendment\u2019s backers promise that the amendment is narrowly targeted at campaign finance rather than political satire. What matters, Cruz counters, is how future generations of lawmakers will view it, once they have such powerful tools embedded in the Constitution.\n\"Lots of Democrats argue passionately, \u2018We don\u2019t intend to prohibit books or movies or Saturday Night Live,\u2019 \" Cruz said in the interview. \"In all likelihood, Congress would not try to do so. But things can change. I am not content to entrust our free-speech rights to the good graces and whims of Congress and hope that politicians don\u2019t abuse their power.\"\nIndeed, Cruz noted that the facts at issue in the Citizens United case involved the ability of a non-profit corporation making a movie critical of Hillary Clinton. \"Democrats say it\u2019s unrealistic, but we\u2019ve already seen government go after a corporation making a movie about a politician.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 10, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump signs Insurrection Act - General Flynn to be appointed vice president.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat experts say\nSeveral legal experts we interviewed agreed that Cruz had a point.\n\"It\u2019s quite obvious that, under this proposed amendment, Congress could pass a law prohibiting corporations and their agents from, say, supporting or opposing candidates during a broadcast other than a news program,\" said Ilya Shapiro, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute. \"Congress would get free rein to legislate in this area.\"\nOther scholars weren\u2019t as gung-ho as Shapiro was but still agreed that Cruz\u2019s scenario can\u2019t be ruled out. \"Generally, if the government has the power to regulate some activity, it can impose civil liability or criminal penalties as it chooses,\" said University of Pennsylvania law professor Kermit Roosevelt. \"If the amendment were broadly construed, I would say it's possible.\"\nAnd Andrew Koppelman, a Northwestern University law professor, said he sees what Cruz \"is getting at. Any criticism of a politician by something as expensive to produce as a TV show is spending money in a way that could influence elections.\"\nThat said, a number of the experts we contacted -- including some of those who acknowledged above that Cruz had a point -- consider the scenario more far-fetched than the senator lets on. Here are the two main reasons why:\n\u2022 Even after the amendment was in force, a lot would need to happen before any satirist felt the heat from prosecutors. Both chambers of Congress would need to pass a bill on this subject, and the president would have to sign it into law. Then, judges would have to agree wholeheartedly with the interpretation Cruz fears and uphold the law. And prosecutors would have to consider it a good use of their time to go after TV comedians or media outlets for speech violations.\n\"The government has many powers that could be used to do bad and stupid things,\" Roosevelt said. \"Congress could ban the sale of milk, for instance. Ordinarily we rely on the democratic political process to stop that.\"\nErwin Chemerinsky, the law school dean at the University of California-Irvine, said that while he opposes the proposed amendment, he believes that Cruz was \"engaged in hyperbole. It is not a reasonable way to interpret the amendment.\"\nAnd Douglas W. Kmiec, a Pepperdine University law professor who served in the Justice Department under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, agreed.\n\"If the amendment referred to by Mr. Cruz could possibly be interpreted in the manner in which he described, it would be a triumph of fiction over language, and would be contrary to the well-established interpretive canon that one should certainly avoid interpreting statutes -- let alone other provisions in the Constitution -- in a manner that would negate their validity.\"\n\u2022 Even if prosecutors started using their newly granted powers, it\u2019s a stretch for Cruz to invoke the word \"jail.\" In theory, it\u2019s possible to go to prison for violations of campaign-finance law -- up to two years, plus fines, according to federal law. This existing law might well come into play under the SNL scenario, Cruz and his allies say. However, in U.S. history, examples of criminalizing speech itself are rare, and prison time is even rarer.\nNot counting examples of speech accompanied by other law-breaking behavior, such as trespassing, the experts we interviewed could only name the Sedition Act of 1798 and the Espionage Act of 1917 as examples. (Some would also include the trials of comedian Lenny Bruce in the 1960s, though Bruce\u2019s cases involved speech that was allegedly obscene rather than political.)\nIt\u2019s important to note that these precedents, far from carrying judicial weight today, are now regretted and held up as cautionary tales.\n\"Contemporary doctrine repudiates these historical missteps,\" said Timothy Zick, a law professor at the College of William and Mary. \"It would take nothing short of a revolutionary shift in judicial thinking to uphold any measure that criminalized pure political satire.\"\nCruz\u2019s rebuttal\nCruz acknowledged to PolitiFact that past history shows few prosecutions and prison terms for purely political speech. But that doesn\u2019t comfort him, for one reason: All of this judicial and historical precedent protecting speech springs from the First Amendment as we know it, not the new reality that would be shaped by the amendment now being debated.\nLaws like the Sedition Act were \"patently unconstitutional,\" Cruz said in the interview. But the proposed amendment now being debated \"does not just reverse Citizens United, it goes much further than that. It was never the law previously that Congress could prohibit a corporation from speaking about politics.\" Supporters of the amendment, he said, may \"point to case law upholding the First Amendment, but none of that matters, because a subsequent amendment would trump those rulings.\"\nIn this complicated debate, there\u2019s only one thing that seems to be a pretty good bet, said Brett Kappel, a counsel at the law firm Arent Fox LLP. \"I\u2019m sure SNL will be mocking Sen. Cruz\" on its next show, he said.\nOur ruling\nCruz said that \"Lorne Michaels could be put in jail under this amendment for making fun of any politician.\"\nMost experts we talked to agreed that the proposed amendment\u2019s language left open the door to that possibility. But many of those same experts emphasized that prosecuting, much less imprisoning, a comedian for purely political speech would run counter to centuries of American tradition, and would face many obstacles at a variety of government levels and run headlong into popular sentiment.\nIn the big picture, Cruz makes a persuasive case that it\u2019s not a good idea to mess with the First Amendment. Still, his SNL scenario is far-fetched. The claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07322"}
