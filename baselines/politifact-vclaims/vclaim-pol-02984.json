We also saw it on other outlets.\nFacebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network\u2019s efforts to stamp out fake news.\nThe post began by claiming Kessler, who organized the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Va., on Aug. 12, had been exposed as a former liberal, Occupy Wall Street protester and Obama supporter. The post included this tweet from conservative writer Dinesh D\u2019Souza:\nWell, well. The white supremacist organizer of #Charlottesville was an Obama supporter & Occupy Wall Street activist https://t.co/hI5PxNUmb7\u2014 Dinesh D'Souza (@DineshDSouza) August 15, 2017\n\nThat part, at least, is accurate, as D\u2019Souza\u2019s link to the Southern Poverty Law Center showed. Kessler has said he changed ideologies near the end of 2013. But that\u2019s about all in the story that\u2019s true.\nThe story said Kessler was the person accused of being \"the white supremacist who ran over a protester who was blocking the road.\" That\u2019s not the case.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharlottesville police arrested James Alex Fields Jr. for driving his car into a crowd of liberal protesters, killing one woman and injuring 19 more people.\nThere have been several fake news stories attempting to shift the blame for the killing or suggesting Democrats were behind the protests. This attempt to put the blame on Kessler included the assertion in the post that he visited Obama in the White House in 2016, including the crude Photoshopped image at the top of this page with the story.\nThat photo is actually a White House image from 2011, showing actor Will Ferrell visiting Obama in the Oval Office (Ferrell\u2019s wife Viveca Paulin has been cropped out):\n\n\nAnd while the story attempted to demonize liberals by drawing lines between Democrats and Nazis, the source of the story is a website that makes up its content.\nThe post first appeared Aug. 15 on OurLandOfTheFree.com, a parody site that, like other sites that created stories we\u2019ve debunked, attempts to fool conservatives with absurd stories.\nOurLandOfTheFree.com said at the bottom of its home page that the site\u2019s creators \"make no guarantee that what you read here is true. In fact, it most definitely is not.\" Its About Us page noted, \"All posts should be considered satirical and all images photoshopped to look like something they\u2019re not.\"\nThis post makes word salad out of key talking points from the Charlottesville clashes, using a couple of factual details to further confuse what\u2019s real and what\u2019s not.\nWe rate the claim Pants On Fire!\n Share the Facts 2017-08-23 13:50:43 UTC   PolitiFact    1 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Pants on Fire  https://patriotusa.website/2017/08/15/white-supremacist-killed-protester-democrat-visited-obama-oval-office/ \"White supremacist who killed protester is a Democrat and visited (President Barack) Obama in Oval Office.\"    Internet rumors Bloggers   in Internet posts Tuesday, August 15, 2017 2017-08-15    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-02984"}
