Let\u2019s start with the origins of the National Day of Prayer, which is an annual observance for people of all faiths.\n\nPresident Harry Truman established the day as a national event in 1952. In 1988, President Ronald Reagan signed a resolution designating the first Thursday in May as the National Day of Prayer. Every president since \u2013 including Obama \u2013 has issued a proclamation to recognize the day.\n\nObama, however, has not held the National Day of Prayer ceremony at the White House that President George W. Bush had for eight years. Presidents George H.W. Bush held one, in 1989, and Reagan also held one, in 1982. President Bill Clinton had none. So, there have not been 21 annual National Day of Prayer ceremonies, as the email claims.\n\nIn fact-checking this email, we found at least 30 published reports in a basic Google search debunking various claims in it. While those reports confirm that Obama decided against the public White House ceremony, none state exactly why. In a May 7, 2009 CNN \u00a0video, a representative with the Christian Broadcast Network speculated the cancelation might stem from publicity about controversial comments once made by the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, Obama\u2019s longtime pastor in Chicago. Other articles imply that a statement in Obama\u2019s inaugural speech about inclusivity of all religions and nonreligions in the United States might have been a factor.\n\nAt the time, White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said of Obama\u2019s plans on the National Day of Prayer,\u00a0\"Privately, he\u2019ll pray as he does every day.\"\n\nThe same is expected this year.\n\n\"As he has done each of the last three years, President Obama will continue to recognize the National Day of Prayer,\" White House spokesman Brandon Lepow said in an email.\n\nNext, let\u2019s review the claim about \"a National Day of Prayer FOR THE MUSLIM RELIGION\" being held \"on Capitol Hill, Beside the White House.\"\n\nThe Jummah Prayer on Capitol Hill event was a one-time only activity coordinated by the Dar-ul-Islam mosque in Elizabeth to \"clear up myths about Muslims,\" said Imam Ali Jaaber, who attended the Sept. 25, 2009 event. It was never billed as a National Day Of Prayer.\n\nHassen Abdellah, board president at Dar-ul-Islam, organized the event in response to positive remarks by Obama in his inaugural speech and during another speech five months later in Egypt about welcoming and acknowledging the presence of Muslims in the United States, Jaaber said.\n\nAlso, Capitol Hill is approximately one mile from the White House \u2013 not beside it. And, Muslim is not a religion. A person who follows the religion Islam is a Muslim.\n\nOur ruling\n\nA chain email circulating in New Jersey that Obama canceled the 21st annual National Day of Prayer ceremony in 2009 but a National Day of Prayer for Muslims was held later that year on Capitol Hill is full of inaccuracies. While it\u2019s true that Obama did not hold a public ceremony at the White House that President George W. Bush did, it\u2019s untrue that the ceremony would have been the 21st annual event. But wait \u2013 there\u2019s more: the email\u2019s author incorrectly located Capitol Hill as \"beside\" the White House and identified Muslim as a religion. Despite the numerous errors in the email, it does contain an element of truth -- and that fits the Truth-O-Meter\u2019s definition for Mostly False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on February 7, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Satan flashed in the halftime Super Bowl satanic ritual.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 February 8, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo comment on this story, go to\u00a0NJ.com.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11635"}
