The National Republican Congressional Committee is chipping in for part of the cost of Cornilles\u2019 ad buy.\n\nThe memo is addressed to members of the Oregon media and lists three \"False attacks\" within the Cornilles\u2019 ad that the Bonamici folks say have been discredited by independent news analysts. Yours truly, PolitiFact Oregon, is on the list:\n\u00a0\n\nFalse Attack #2:\n\nAD: \"She voted for higher taxes and fees on the middle class and small business.\"\n\nOn January 2, 2012, The Oregonian\u2019s PolitiFact found this attack to be so FALSE that it was rated \"Pants on Fire.\"\n\n\"We can\u2019t accept their explanation that punishing unemployment benefit cheats or allowing the state to go after people who haven\u2019t paid taxes is a new tax or fee.\"\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on February 1, 2021 in on social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the 2017 tax law, \u201cpeople who make under $75,000 will have their taxes raised in 2021 and every 2 years after that until 2027.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Louis Jacobson \u2022 February 5, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttp://www.politifact.com/oregon/statements/2012/jan/10/rob-cornilles/rob-cornilles-claims-suzanne-bonamici-has-voted-60/\n\n\nWe\u2019re astonished with the Bonamici campaign\u2019s interpretation. The quote about punishing unemployment benefit cheats contained in the media release is certainly ours, and the ruling is accurate, but that is not the statement on which we ruled. We ruled on his statement that Bonamici \"voted for 60 tax increases.\"\n\nLet\u2019s make this clear: It is 100 percent true that Bonamici has voted for higher taxes and fees while in the Legislature. What Bonamici hadn\u2019t done while in the Oregon Legislature was vote for 60 tax increases. This statement was the subject of an earlier ad by the Cornilles\u2019 campaign, the one we ruled Pants on Fire.\n\nWe found Bonamici had voted for 14, maybe 16 tax increases, at least 32 fee increases and 14 bills that should in no way have been included as a tax or fee increase, such as legislation to punish unemployment benefit cheats. All of that combined prompted our ruling of Pants on Fire.\n\nCarol Butler, Bonamici\u2019s campaign manager, said she found it incredible that we would fact check a press release when there are so many outrageous statements coming from the Cornilles\u2019 campaign. She said she saw no difference between the Cornilles\u2019 campaign\u2019s \u00a0two statements on tax voting, as they both intend to mislead voters.\n\nWe see a big difference. Here\u2019s what the Bonamici people didn\u2019t include from our original PolitiFact:\n\u00a0\n\n\"It\u2019s fair to say that Bonamici can\u2019t recall ever voting against a tax increase or fee hike. It\u2019s fair to say that she has one of the most liberal voting records in the Legislature. It\u2019s fair to say that she has voted for big-ticket tax increases that have infuriated conservatives in Oregon. Cornilles could have stuck with that script and his statements would have been True.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWe note that on Wednesday, the Bonamici campaign launched a new ad that correctly states that we gave Cornilles a Pants on Fire for \"more false attacks on Bonamici and taxes.\":\n\nThe Cornilles\u2019 campaign claim that \"she voted for higher taxes and fees\" is spot on. The Bonamici campaign is twisting a PolitiFact for its own campaign purposes. We rule that a Pants on Fire.\n\nGo back to OregonLive to comment.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-11767"}
