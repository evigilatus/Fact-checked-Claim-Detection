The number of women behind the bars in Virginia was rising dramatically and the criminal justice system could not be accompanied by it during a radio interview on 15 March on the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) in Washington. The Emergency Act required Virginia and other states to adopt better standards for the treatment of women prisoners. \"Women in Virginia have been imprisoned at an increasingly high rate. Corey said that the increase in the past four or five years was about 300 per cent. It is widely reported that the number of female prisoners in the country has increased at a much faster rate than the number of male prisoners. But Korea's claim that \"about\" an increase of 300 percent of Virginia's female prisoners caught our attention. So, we checked the truth. The number of prisoners in Virginia is found in State-run prisons and in locally or regionally administered prisons. Through three sources, we found statistics that enable us to calculate the annual estimates of male and female inmates from December 2013 to June 2018. This means 4.5 years in the middle of \"the last four or five years\" mentioned by Korean. We used data published by the Federal Bureau of Justice Statistics and sent to us by the State Department of Corrections for prison inmates. We also used statistics either published or sent to us by the State Reparations Board for the Prison Population. At the end of 2013, there were approximately 5,700 female prisoners in prisons and prisons, which rose to about 6,700 in June 2018. This represents an increase of 18 per cent and should not be overlooked. The number of male prisoners during the same period decreased by 1.4 per cent - from about 51,200 to 50,500. The different trends of male-female incarceration have drawn the attention of many prison reform advocates, including the Virginia branch of the American Civil Liberties Union. But the increase in the number of female prisoners is a very small part of the 300 percent increase that Korean demanded. Korean explanation before our research, Korean told us that she read about an increase of 300 percent \"a few years ago\" in the Richmond Times-Dispatch article. Max Jenkins, her administrative assistant, called quickly and said that Corey misspoked on the radio. A few days later, he said, \"She meant that there had been a fivefold increase, nationwide, in female incarceration since 2001.\" But this is also wrong. The Times Dispatch did not report any of the statistics used by Corey. On January 18, 2021 in the Committee &apos; s discussion. \u2022 28 January, 2021, according to data from the Federal Statistical Office, 161,200 women were held in prisons and prisons in 2001 and about 218,800 women prisoners in mid-2016 - the latest available information. This represents an increase of 36 per cent, and is barely as high as the 400 per cent claimed by a Korean assistant. It should be noted that during the same period, the number of male prisoners in state and federal prisons increased by 13 per cent - again, a much slower rate than that of women. Korea &apos; s massive growth rate would have survived if it had gone back in time. We found data on the gender population in state and federal prisons - but not prisons - dating back to 1978. There were 359 women in Virginia prisons that year, and the number rose to 3,114 last year. This increase is 767 per cent, almost the same as in the country. The number of male prisoners in Virginia rose by 328 per cent during those years - less than half of the growth rate for women - from 7,985 in 1978 to 34,172 last year. In other words, the number of women prisoners has more than doubled the number of males in prison over the past 40 years. Researchers largely attribute the high number of women prisoners to drugs and poverty. According to the Service, the number of drug arrests doubled between 1980 and 2009 for men, but tripled for women. The number of single mothers living below poverty is more than double that of single parents, according to the United States census. In 2017, the Office estimates that 25.7 per cent of single-mother-headed households were below the poverty line, compared with 12.4 per cent of single-parent households. In general, those on the economic margins of society are more likely to face considerable stress and problems with drugs, and the Federation wrote in a 2018 study on State Women &apos; s Prison. \"These types of stress factors may increase the involvement of women living in poverty in theft, theft, testing, fraud in social welfare and forgery.\" Governor Curie said, \"Women in Virginia have been imprisoned at an increasingly high rate. It's about 300 percent increase in the last four or five years.\" She referred to the surge as a major reason why Virginia needed to ratify the Federal Amendment to the Economic Relations Act. The number of female prisoners in Virginia and the nation has increased, but it has occurred for five decades - not only in the last few years. Over the past four and a half years, there has been an increase of 18 per cent, which is close to a Korean claim. Any estimate that we might give Corey to admit her mistake is dispelled by her alternative interpretation: she intended to say that at the national level, there has been a fivefold increase in the number of women prisoners since 2001. That's also too far away. There has been an increase of 36 per cent. The Korean numbers are astronomically wrong, and we appreciate her false statement.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00820"}
