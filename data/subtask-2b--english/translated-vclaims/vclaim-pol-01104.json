Now, after securing a seat on the Financial Services Committee of the House of Representatives, the Internet calls for the management of its personal funds to question. Facebook, which appeared on January 16, published over 28,000 times and generated approximately 2,000 comments. We also found that several other copies of the claim were spread over the Internet without sources or any kind of evidence. The entire article says: \"Congress Cortez, New York City, was selected to be on the Home Finance Committee, and her credit rating is 430.

From the many insights that I wrote about over the past year, we know that she helped support her family by working in multiple jobs, and that she was criticized by some for not having substantial savings, but nothing comes close to these rumors. Furthermore, a person &apos; s credit rating cannot be obtained without his or her written consent, in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act, and therefore the originator of the rumours is unlikely to obtain such information. Our examination of public records databases did not refer to any eviction or other problems related to law enforcement property or housing (there were no provisions, privileges or bankruptcy). According to the April 2018 financial disclosure report, the only liability on the list is a federal student loan. \"No, that's not true, no credit mark is not 430 and she has no Sharif evacuations,\" said the Ocacio Cortez spokesman. While Okasio-Cortez had to work in two jobs in the past to help support her family and currently had one student loan, there was no evidence to support her expulsion at all, the closure of bank accounts or the low degree of credit.
