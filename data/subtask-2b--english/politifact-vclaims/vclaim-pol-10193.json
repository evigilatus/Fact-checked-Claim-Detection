The vice president was in charge of overseeing this. Ninety billion in green pork to campaign contributors and special interest groups.\"\n\nBiden responded with, \"It was a good idea, Moody's and others said that this was exactly what we needed to stop this from going off the cliff. It set the conditions to be able to grow again.\"\n\nThey argued about whether the stimulus money was wasted, and Ryan said \"Was it a good idea to spend taxpayer dollars on electric cars in Finland, or on windmills in China?\"\n\nRepublicans have made these charges before. In this fact-check, we look at whether the stimulus money went where Ryan said it did.\n\nThe Fisker electric car\n\nIn 2009, an American car company, Fisker Automotive, won a total of $528 million in loan guarantees to build two high-end electric hybrids, the Karma and the Atlantic. The ultimate goal was to build the Atlantic at a defunct auto plant in Delaware. Work on it is currently on hold, and the Delaware plant has yet to open.\n\nThe engineering and design for the Karma was done in the United States, but according to the U.S. Energy Department, the plan from the beginning was to build the cars in Finland. Fisker Automotive told ABC News this work employed about 500 Finnish workers. Company spokesman Roger Ornisher told PolitiFact that the plant has produced over 1,500 Karmas so far.\n\nNot stimulus dollars\n\nThe claim about American stimulus dollars paying for jobs in Finland is flawed in several important respects.\n\nFirst, the money did not come from the stimulus. This nuance seems to slip through the cracks again and again, so the correct information bears repeating.\n\nThat money came as a loan -- not a grant or a tax credit -- through the Energy Department\u2019s Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing program. That program predates the Obama administration. It was not part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, also known as the stimulus. In fact, it\u2019s a program signed into existence by President George W. Bush in 2007 and first funded by legislation Bush signed in 2008.\n\nThe only reference to this loan program in the stimulus is that it received $10 million for administrative expenses.\n\nThe Bush administration was in charge when Fisker Automotive filed its application. The Obama administration was in charge when the company\u2019s loan was approved. The stimulus bill had nothing to do with it.\n\nFisker Automotive says that the accounting firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers audits its accounts to insure that all federal dollars are spent in the United States.\n\nWindmills in China\n\nWindmills from China have something of a history when it comes to political messaging. \u00a0The Romney campaign sent us supporting documents for this claim. Among the reports and articles the campaign cites, one refers to a massive project in Texas that was never built and will never receive stimulus money. Others stem from the Investigative Reporting Workshop, a nonprofit journalism project at American University.\n\nThe Investigative Reporting Workshop\u2019s report backs the claim but paints a murkier picture than the Romney campaign would have you think. The author tallied $2.6 million in stimulus money going to Chinese makers of wind turbines. However, the reporter, Russ Choma, also says that none of the farms used turbines entirely built in China. Additionally, he couldn\u2019t say for sure how much stimulus money made its way to China. \"Some money definitely did, but it is safe to say more money went to creating jobs in the U.S. and Europe,\" he wrote.\n\nA challenging money trail\n\nFederal support for renewable energy projects came through the 1603 tax credit program. So far, this program has paid out about $7.6 billion to wind farms nationwide. Once a project is on line and delivering power, that program pays money to the project developer -- as much as 30 percent of the project cost. Along the way, the developer pays the companies that provided the materials. Following the money becomes complicated because wind turbines are about as intricate as airplanes.\n\nTo choose an example, let\u2019s look at a wind farm going up in Alaska. The lead contractor is General Electric, the world\u2019s third largest supplier of wind turbines and an American firm. But according to the Anchorage Daily News, \"The blades are made in Brazil, the units that contain the generator come from Southern California, the connecting hubs from the Florida Panhandle and the towers are made in China.\"\n\nWe called the American Wind Energy Association, an industry trade group, to see if they knew of any Chinese turbines paid for with American stimulus dollars. They said they did. Their best guess is the number is six -- five in Texas and one in Iowa. But \"that might not be exactly right,\" said Liz Salerno, director of industry data and analysis . \"Because some of the blades and towers in Texas might have come from American firms.\"\n\nIf it is six, that represents a tiny fraction of all the turbines installed with stimulus dollars. Salerno says the program funded more than 12,000 turbine installations over three years. Chinese components might have shown up in various places, but if one is counting complete Chinese \"windmills,\" then they account for less than 1 percent of the total.\n\nOur ruling\n\nPaul Ryan said stimulus dollars were spent on electric cars in Finland and windmills in China.\n\nIn fact, the program that provided loan guarantees for the Fisker cars was not part of the stimulus -- and the money went toward engineering and design in the United States.\n\nAs for the windmills in China, it's true that a small number of windmills and components to build them came from China. But the statement greatly exaggerates China\u2019s role in the overall use of stimulus money.\n\nOn balance, we rate the claim Mostly False.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.
