This is the supposed quote, entirely: \"What the American people need is not more health care. What we need is more attention from Christ. I think if we could just get more people who have health conditions that exist before going back to the churches, you'd see a lot of healing and a lot of these problems go away. People who live God's life don't worry about doctors. We have God to take care of us.\" The article was referred to as part of Facebook efforts to combat false news and misleading information in its news broadcast. \u2219 (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)

Then he failed in the Senate. This time, the quote was published on February 14, on the Facebook page called \"Why Republicans Suck.\" In less than 24 hours, it doubled nearly 200 shares. The text of the quotation is in addition to a picture of pence and what looks like the Fox News code. The code is actually from a page called Fox News, the FB page, which is said to have begun to circulate the fake quote. The page is no longer attached to the news director and can no longer be found on Facebook. As press secretary Alisa Farah, Penny, told us, the quote is false: \"This quote is false and Vice President Pines did not say.\" We value it pants on fire!
