This rule, which is due to enter into force on 15 October, is a new interpretation of the old immigration law and the latest effort by President Donald Trump to restrict certain types of immigration to the United States. But there is some confusion about what this new rule will do and how intense it will be. In the August 14th episode of Fox & Friends First, Radio Schmitt conducted a discussion on the new policy, which he presented as \"changes to immigration laws that can be denied green cards to migrants in need of care in this country.\" \"This rule has been in existence for a while,\" he said at one point. \"This is not something the President is trying to do here, that the United States was this way.\" That made our ears flutter, so we decided to dig into the history of laws that zero on those that are likely to become \"public charges,\" or burdens for American taxpayers. Our conclusion: Schmidt's statement is partially accurate. While the general indictment law has been registered for more than 100 years, the broad interpretation of Trump &apos; s administration is unprecedented. Fox News refused to comment. The old laws, the new public fee laws, are regulations that provide that immigrants to the United States can be expelled if they are likely to rely on public assistance programmes. Schmidt's right. The general indictment law is not new. However, his claim that \"this is not something new the President is trying to do\" leaves some important details. \"There is a long history of public indictment law in this country, but the new regulation represents a significant expansion in how this law is interpreted and applied,\" said Julia Gillat, Senior Policy Analyst at the Institute of Migration Policy, a non-partisan think tank in Washington. \"We have never had such a broad interpretation rather than that which may become a general charge.\" The first Public Charges Act was enacted as part of the Immigration Act 1882. At that time, migrants generally had to show that they had reserve funds and enough money to buy a ticket to their final destination in the United States, as Gilat had said. The general indictment rule has been reaffirmed under the Immigration and Nationality Act 1952 and has been in place in the immigration system since then. However, the law has not for a long time provided any clear definition to determine whether a person represents a possible public charge. He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. \u2022 On 12 January 2021, a bill issued in 1996 stipulated that the Immigration and Naturalization Service should consider the age, health, family status, financial resources, education, skills and ability to obtain written support from the guarantor when deciding whether he or she is likely to become a public official. In 1999, the Immigration and Naturalization Service explained that the term \"public fees\" applied specifically to migrants who \"mainly relied\" on government cash assistance or long-term institutional care. As experts have told us, the new base of Trump management expands this definition and will affect hundreds of thousands of migrants who come legally to the United States every year and apply for permanent stay. Once this rule has entered into force, immigration officers will be able to refuse legal entry visas to migrants if they are considered \"more likely\" to use public goods such as medical aid, food stamps or housing vouchers. Immigrants who are legally in the United States with temporary visas and who have relied on these benefits in the past may find it more difficult to obtain a green card. This rule will not affect persons who already have green cards, refugees and asylum-seekers, as well as some military personnel, pregnant women and children. The Trump Administration has defended this move as preserving the public benefits of qualified United States citizens and promoting self-sufficiency among immigrants to the United States. However, generations have said that the rule can be used to deny green card applications more than before, and as a result, \"have dramatic effects on the level of legal migration to the country, and on the characteristics of legal immigrants.\" Kevin Johnson, Dean of the Law School of the University of California Davis, noted that immigration law enforcement had already changed radically under Trump. He said that the number of refusals to grant visas to Mexican migrants had increased, with reference to a political report stating that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had rejected 5,343 applications for visas from Mexican migrants on general grounds between 1 October and 29 July. United States Citizenship and immigration services have not weighed the accuracy of Schmidt's claim, but the Agency's Press Office has told us: \"The general charge has been part of the United States Immigration Act for more than 100 years, which has long appeared, such as the Immigration Act of 1882, as a ground for inadmissibility, and has existed in its present form since 1996. Our referee Schmidt said, \"This rule has been in existence for a while. This is not something the President is trying to do here, that the United States was this way.\" The general charge as a criterion of inadmissibility has been a fundamental element of the Immigration Act since 1882. However, the new Trump policy will significantly change the way immigration officials decide which legal immigrants should not be eligible for visas or green cards. The statement is partially accurate but omits important details. So we're doing it half right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00266"}
