We often hear stories about people who say, \" Yesterday, I was talking to him, why did he suddenly die? ' We stop immediately and the brain doesn't have a blood cycle.\" Then the article says that three and a half minutes after you wake up is important because \"at sudden height, the brain will have anaemia and will cause heart failure due to a lack of blood.\" So, according to the post, you should stay in bed for a minute and a half when you wake up, sit in bed for another half minute, and then drop your legs and sit on the edge of the bed for another half minute. \"In three and a half minutes, your brain will not have anaemia and your heart will not weaken, thereby reducing the risk of sudden fall and death,\" the article says, encouraging people to share these guidance with family and friends.
