A magazine closely related to the church gave Farrakhan an award for lifetime achievement. For more on this, see the statement\n\nhere\n\n.\n\n\nBut Barack Obama definitely did not remain silent about it. The award received widespread attention after\n\nWashington Post\n\ncolumnist Richard Cohen wrote about it on Jan. 15, 2008.\n\n\nLater that day, the campaign released a statement in which Obama himself said:\n\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloggers\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Gen.

I assume that\n\nTrumpet Magazine\n\nmade its own decision to honor Farrakhan based on his efforts to rehabilitate ex-offenders, but it is not a decision with which I agree.\"\n\n\nCohen said in his column that he had asked the campaign about the award and received a response from a spokesperson saying Obama did not agree with the award. The blog \"Talking Points Memo\" said it too asked Obama about Farrakhan and received the statement from Obama rejecting the award. After the statement was released, it was reported in other news outlets as well. For these reasons, we find the e-mail's claims about Obama's response to the award to be False.\n\n\n\nUPDATE:\n\nBarack Obama\n\nresigned from Trinity United Church of Christ\n\non May 31, 2008, after church pastor Jeremiah A.
