Shemia Fagan sponsor the 'new Buy American law'?", "text": "State Rep. Shemia Fagan, a first-term Democrat, is running for re-election for House District 51.\nHouse Republicans, who support Fagan\u2019s challenger, Jodi Bailey, sent us a statement from Fagan\u2019s Voters\u2019 Pamphlet entry. They argue that the statement mischaracterizes Fagan\u2019s involvement in a bill introduced into the regular session of the 2013 Legislature.\nThe claim:\nThe statement pertains to House Bill 3473, which would have amended part of the state\u2019s public contracting code to require public agencies to buy American-made iron or steel if the purchase amount exceeded $50,000.\nFagan says in her entry: \"I sponsored Oregon\u2019s new Buy American law and fought to give local companies the first shot at state contracts, so your hard earned tax dollars create more jobs here at home.\"\n\"HB 3473 of the 2013 session did NOT become law,\" wrote Kara Walker, a House Republicans\u2019 spokeswoman. \"Rep. Fagan\u2019s assertion that she sponsored a new law is false and misleading.\"\nPolitiFact Oregon decided to check.\nThe analysis:\nWe contacted Fagan\u2019s campaign. Fagan, a business attorney by profession, defended her choice of words in an email.\n\"Yes, the terms \u2018bill\u2019 and \u2018law\u2019 are frequently used interchangeably in common speak,\" she wrote, \"particularly by everyday Oregonians, who are the audience for my Voter\u2019s Pamphlet statement.\"\nA quick Google search, she added, turned up two instances supporting her assertion. One linked to a report by a southern Oregon television station headlined \"Now it\u2019s Oregon Senate\u2019s turn to vote on gun laws.\" The second took us to a press release issued last spring by the Oregon Republican Party. The release, Fagan said, \"...used the terms \u2018bill\u2019 and \u2018law\u2019 interchangeably.\"\nWe checked the state\u2019s legislative website and found Fagan among the 10 sponsors -- six Democrats and four Republicans -- of HB 3473. The bill had a first reading in the House on March 28, 2013. One public hearing was held on April 10, 2013. The bill was still stuck in the House Business and Labor Committee when the session ended on July 8, 2013.\nSo could she rightfully call it a law?\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden is on video \"admitting to\" election fraud in a \"confession.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe called Legislative Counsel Dexter Johnson, whose office reviews legislators\u2019 proposals for new laws and drafts them into bill form for presentation to the full assembly.\nHe walked us through the bill-drafting process then summed up: \"This is technically a bill. It didn\u2019t become law.\"\nWe called Vera Katz, a longtime Oregon Democratic legislator who served as speaker of the House and later as Portland mayor. We didn\u2019t identify Fagan by name, but asked if \"bill\" and \"law\" are routinely used interchangeably in Salem.\n\"That\u2019s not accurate,\" she said. \"It\u2019s a bill. It\u2019s not a law. That person should have been more careful.\"\nWe turned to the links Fagan provided. The KPIC (Roseburg) headline referred to \"gun laws,\" but every reference in the story was to \"bills.\"\nThe GOP press release, issued April 4, 2013, stated why the party opposed four proposed Democratic gun bills. \"Such laws,\" the release stated, \"assume the guilt of all firearms owners\u2026\" That language, however, seems conditional, gathering any anti-gun legislation under one umbrella and saying, in essence, \"laws such as these aren\u2019t needed.\"\nFinally, we tackled the aspect of Fagan\u2019s claim where she argues that the words \u2018bill\u2019 and \u2018law\u2019 \"are frequently used interchangeably in common speak, particularly by everyday Oregonians\u2026\"\nPolitiFact Oregon hit the streets and put the question to the first two dozen people we encountered: Where the Legislature is concerned, are the words \"bill\" and \"law\" interchangeable?\nNot counting the three people who waved us off, all answered immediately that the terms are separate and distinct.\nThe ruling:\nFagan, in her first re-election bid for House District 51, wrote in her Voters\u2019 Pamphlet that she \"sponsored Oregon\u2019s new Buy American law.\"\nHB 3473, the proposal to amend Oregon\u2019s public contract code, died in committee after one public hearing. It didn\u2019t pass either chamber and was never signed into law by Gov. John Kitzhaber.\nThe office that drafts legislative proposals said the words can\u2019t be used interchangeably, while a longtime Oregon politician said Fagan should \"have been more careful\" in her statement.\nThe links Fagan provided to defend her statement fell short of being persuasive, and a quick and unscientific survey of \"everyday people\" failed to back her claim.\nIf re-elected, Fagan said she plans to reintroduce the bill in the 2015 session. There\u2019s still the chance, then, that her bill will become a law. In the meantime, we rate her claim False.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07312"}
