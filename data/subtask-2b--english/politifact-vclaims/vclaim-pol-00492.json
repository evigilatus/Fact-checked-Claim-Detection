They will accept anything \u2013 forcible blood or organ donation \u2013 for the \"greater good.\" We can genetically modify children and sterilize them \u2013 for the \"greater good.\" Control sheep minds and you control the herd. Vaccine makers stand to make billions, and many of you in this room today are investors. It\u2019s a big win-win! We thin out the herd and the herd pays us for providing extermination services.
