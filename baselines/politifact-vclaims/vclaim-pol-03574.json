CO2 is a primary contributor to global warming. That fact is not in dispute among climate scientists,\" said Anne Slinn, executive director for research of the Center for Global Change Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\nThis chart from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shows that even though the earth has experienced fluctuations in carbon dioxide levels throughout its history, there\u2019s more carbon dioxide now than there has been in at least 400,000 years.\n\nThe previous peak carbon dioxide concentration was about 300 parts per million, 300,000 years ago. Today, the count is more than 400 parts per million.\nBy the end of the 1970s, before global warming was readily apparent, scientists had already formed a consensus that human-produced carbon dioxide would cause the climate to change. And by the mid-1990s, scientists understood that global warming had already occurred over the past 100 years, and carbon dioxide was a substantial cause, said Ralph Keeling, director of the Scripps CO2 Center at the University of California, San Diego.\n\"Administrator Pruitt\u2019s statement means that he does not accept the overwhelming scientific consensus,\" said Stephen Pacala, co-director of Princeton University\u2019s Carbon Mitigation Initiative, pointing to a 2013 report out of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\nWe reached numerous climate experts, all of whom reiterated the view that Pruitt\u2019s claim is contrary to the prevailing scientific thought. For a perspective outside the norm, we also reached out to Roger Pielke\u00a0Sr., an emeritus professor of atmospheric science at Colorado State University, who has argued that carbon dioxide is one of many human-caused factors contributing to long-term changes in the climate, but it\u2019s not the dominant one. For example, the release of black carbon (soot) or land use changes might have a larger effect on the climate relative to carbon dioxide than is currently believed.\nIn Pielke\u2019s view, a more accurate version of Pruitt\u2019s statement would be: \"I would not agree that CO2 is the only contributor to changes and longterm variations in climate.\"\nOur ruling\nPruitt said carbon dioxide is not \"a primary contributor to the global warming that we see.\"\nThe prevailing scientific consensus is that human production of carbon dioxide since the Industrial Revolution is a leading cause of climate change. Some scientists may quibble over how much of the change can be attributed specifically to carbon dioxide, but there is no doubt that it plays an important role.\nWe rate Pruitt\u2019s claim False.\n Share the Facts   Politifact    5 7  Politifact Rating: False  Carbon dioxide is not \"a primary contributor to the global warming that we see.\"    Scott Pruitt EPA administrator   in a CNBC interview Thursday, March 9, 2017 03/09/2017    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-03574"}
