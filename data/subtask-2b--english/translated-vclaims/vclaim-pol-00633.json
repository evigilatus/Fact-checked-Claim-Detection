Most of the world &apos; s countries strongly condemned the Maduro Government for suffering in Venezuela, including many deaths. Rick Scott, R-Fella, has a word for it: genocide. Its use of that specific word distinguishes it from other politicians. \"The pain, the hunger, the destruction. I cannot believe that any human being will do this to young children. \"Scott said May 13, 2019 at the U.S. Concordia Summit in Colombia. \"This is evil. There is only one man responsible for this: Nicholas Maduro. This is clear to most of us. Nicholas Maduro is genocide against his people. The former Governor, Scott, representing a State with many Venezuelan immigrants, repeatedly used the word \"genocide\" to describe the situation under Maduro. Scott defended his use of genocide when the Miami Herald questioned him. \"The young children starve to death because Maduro won't give them food,\" Scott told the newspaper. \"This is called genocide. I'm very comfortable with what's going on in Venezuela... genocide. I think Maduro is starving on purpose. When we asked Scott's office about this, his spokesman sent out the United Nations definition of genocide, arguing that Maduro's actions fit the bill. The experts we contacted agreed that the situation in Venezuela was deplorable. But they also agreed that Scott's use of the word was a major overrun. They said it was important, because the use of the word \"genocide\" too loosely makes it difficult to define and stop actual genocide. The corruption and mismanagement that has taken place in Venezuela in recent decades have left Venezuela - once rich in generous oil resources - a disaster. More than 3 million people have left Venezuela in recent years. Maduro won a re-election in May 2018 in a race that was criticized as a fake and was sworn in in January 10. Two weeks later, the leader of the opposition and the Speaker of the National Assembly, Juan Guayedo, announced himself as interim President. The Trump administration, as well as many other world leaders, have recognized Guadu. Maduro severed relations with the United States, expelled diplomats and prevented aid. It is difficult to obtain a specific number of deaths, although news reports say that dozens of Venezuelans died in protests this year, and reports indicate higher numbers in previous years. Many died from deteriorating conditions, including power outages and shortages of medicines and food. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) stated that Venezuela had seen a rise in the rate of homicides in recent years and had reported thousands of killings by the Government to a civil society organization. However, the Venezuelan Government refused to disseminate information about the health crisis. When we asked Scott's office to explain the senator's use of \"genocide\" to describe Maduro's actions, his spokesman Chris Hartlin sent out the official definition of the United Nations genocide: genocide means any of the following acts committed with the intention of destroying, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, including a national, racial or religious group. (b) Killing members of the group; \u2022 The imposition of measures aimed at preventing intra-group births; \u2022 5 October 2009 (e) The forced transfer of children of the group to another group. In the midst of deaths and bad conditions, we wanted to know how Maduro's actions fit these criteria. The experts said they didn't. The situation in Venezuela is different when the United Nations formulates its definition, recognizing that \"a popular understanding of what constitutes genocide tends to be broader than the content of the rule under international law.\" It adds, \"It is important that victims of genocide are deliberately - not randomly - targeted because of their real or perceived membership in one of the four groups protected under the Convention, which excludes political groups, for example. This means that the goal of destruction must be the group, as such, and not its members as individuals.\" Experts say that the narrower definition is appropriate, regardless of what can be used on a grass-roots scale. Maduro may have violated other aspects of international law, such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights or the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which Venezuela confirmed decades ago. However, Maduro's actions \"did not seem to qualify for genocide under the legal definition\" of the United Nations, as Anthony Clarke Arenda, a professor of government and foreign service at Georgetown University, said. That is because genocide, by the definition of the United Nations, means the destruction of a particular group. The term \"national\" in the definition of the United Nations does not apply in the case of Venezuela, as it is intended to refer to national groups such as Kurds, Inuit and bask, as Arenda said. He said that \"acts that target the population as a whole or groups not included in the list, although potentially appalling, are not qualified as genocide.\" In Rwanda, Nazi Germany or Tutsis have committed examples of genocide against Jews. \"This is more typical authoritarian repression than anything else,\" said the politician at the Florida International University, Eduardo Gamara, a specialist in Venezuela. \"It's not genocide.\" While some hard-line opponents of the regime continue to charge Maduro in The Hague for crimes against humanity, this standard is lower than genocide, as stated by the historian Alejandro Velasco of the University of New York. Michael O'Hanlon, a senior foreign policy colleague at the Brookings Institution, said: \"It's not really genocide when you kill your people without caring for race, language, religion or other factors.\" \" Crimes against humanity may be more appropriate.\" The fears about the excessive use of the word \"multiple scientists\" told Polyte Fuckett that they were concerned about the consequences of Scott's language. Miguel Tinker Salas, a specialist at the Pomona College of Latin American Studies, said. Robert Gelati, historian of the State University of Florida and co-author of \"The view of genocide: mass murder in historical perspective,\" called Scott \"unacute and useless.\" He said: \"We must stop using \"genocide\" as the final word we use to describe a terrible crime, even to hurt or kill some people intentionally.\" \"Genocide rarely occurs, and we must bear in mind the narrow use of the term.\" Umar Bartov, historian of Brown University and author of the book Anatomy of Genocide: The Life and Death of a Town called Buckshaks, said that the reduction of this term could hinder efforts to stop genocide when it occurs. Bartov said, \"Use this term when it is not appropriate to prejudice the idea of genocide prevention.\" The governor said, \"Nicholas Maduro is genocide against his people.\" The experts in the field of genocide contacted by the Polyte Factus Foundation agreed globally that the conditions in Venezuela were appalling, and many said that Maduro's actions amounted to tyranny and possibly crimes against humanity. However, they strongly agreed that \"genocide,\" as defined by the United Nations, did not apply to the situation in Venezuela, as it did not imply the deliberate targeting of an ethnic group for destruction. We're assessing the statement wrong. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/29105cbb-48d9-4ea1-98ac-b536afc528eb", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00633"}
