Therefore, earlier this year, the Department began a pilot DNA testing programme for some of the groups arrested at the border that claimed to be family units, as a means of determining whether they actually had a relationship. According to the Acting Director of the United States Office Approximately one third of suspicious cases were found to reveal false families. \"You've no doubt heard about experimental programs with the Border Patrol where they're testing DNA,\" said Coxinelli at the Texas Public Policy Foundation 22, 2019. \"They recognize fake families.\" In areas where these projects are being implemented, it's almost 30% of fake families.\" While the DNA test programme revealed cases of immigrant groups lying about being families, the federal data we found showed that the rate of fake families was lower than the number of Cochinelli. The aforementioned DNA test programme (Cucinelli) was carried out earlier this year by United States immigration and customs agents. Officials said that rapid DNA tests, conducted through cheek surveys, were conducted on a voluntary basis. The results take about 90 minutes to produce. Before conducting a rapid DNA test, officials relied on more traditional means of investigation to expel counterfeit families, such as examining documents relating to forgery. Using these methods, clients discovered over 1,000 cases of counterfeit families attempting to cross the southern border from October 2018 to April this year, according to the Washington Post. :: During a three-day test operation from 8 to 10 May, the DNA test revealed that part of the groups arrested crossing the border illegally had lied about their association with each other. But the rate wasn't as high as 30% as Cochinel said. According to a statement from the CIA in June, clients tested 84 family units that \"presented fraud evidence.\" Of these, 16 groups claiming to be a family were identified as counterfeit. This rate is 19 per cent. The Board &apos; s June statement also stated that the Agency would extend the pilot programme for 120 days and extend it to five additional border locations starting later that month. However, we did not find any data showing the results of the expanded pilot programme. Internal security did not respond or provide data when asked. United States Office The Citizenship and Immigration Service - under the responsibility of Cuchinelli - has not responded to our request either. The distinguished fact-finding bloggers mentioned on January 10, 2021 in the story of \"The Rebel Law - General Flynn will be appointed Vice-President.\" \u2022 On January 11, 2012, it is not quite clear where the 30 percent of Coxinelli comes from. On 1 May, Associated Press stated that \"the CIA officials said that they had identified 101 possible cases of fake families since April 18 and decided that one third of them were fraud.\" However, that report was published prior to the launch of the DNA pilot programme, which began on 8 May. About a week after the completion of the first phase of the pilot programme in May, a Washington examiner on 18 May reported 30%, citing an unidentified official involved in the provisional implementation of the system. \"About 30% of the rapid DNA tests of immigrant adults suspected of reaching the southern border with children who did not reveal that adults had nothing to do with children, an official involved in the provisional implementation of the system that requested to be anonymous in order to speak freely to the examiner Washington,\" reported the newspaper on 18 May. Sin Lindsay Graham, R-S.C., also cited the 30 per cent figure during his appearance on 14 July in the Fox News Sunday morning in the future. \"Thirty percent of people with young children are fake families,\" said Fox News Maria Barteromo. The Graham office indicated that the Senator did not describe the results of the DNA pilot programme. It was referring to data on fake families collected prior to the DNA test. The governor of Cuchinelli said we had a federal pilot program for testing illegal immigrants' DNA that showed \"something like 30% (of those tested) fake families.\" It is not quite clear where the number of Coxinelli comes from at 30 per cent. According to Associated Press, in the latter half of April, border officials identified about 100 potential cases of fraudulent families, and found one third of these cases to be fraudulent. However, these results were based on traditional investigative techniques such as document examination, which occurred before the DNA testing programme came into effect. An article published in the Washington Journal on May 18, about a week after the completion of the first phase of the DNA pilot programme, reported 30 percent statistics, citing an unnamed immigration official. But in June, the CIA published data showing about 20% of suspicious cases found DNA evidence that refuted a family relationship. The relevant agencies have not responded to our request for information. We value this half right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00234"}
