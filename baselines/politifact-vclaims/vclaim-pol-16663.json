Harry Reid continues to spread online despite being debunked for several years\nThe online story has been circulating since at least 2000, targeting not only Reid but several political figures. Other versions have featured the surnames of President Donald Trump, former President George W. Bush, Hillary Clinton and Al Gore, among others.\nA Reid version was posted to Facebook in 2013 and is being re-shared recently. The post claims a genealogy researcher named Judy Wallman was working on her family tree when she found that the former senator from Nevada has a great-great uncle, Remus Reid, who was \"hanged for horse stealing and train robbery in Montana in 1889,\" and whom Wallman also shared as an ancestor.\nThe post displays a black-and-white photograph that is supposedly Remus Reid standing on a platform as a noose is tightened around his neck. It isn\u2019t him. The image actually depicts outlaw Tom \"Black Jack\" Ketchum, who was hanged in New Mexico in 1901 for attempted train robbery, among other crimes.\nAll versions of this claim end with the politician\u2019s office \u2014 in this case, Harry Reid\u2019s office \u2014 issuing a statement to Wallman that attempts to spin the life-story of the supposedly criminal \"great-great uncle\" into something more legitimate, calling the ancestor a \"famous cowboy,\" who \"passed away during an important civic function held in his honor when the platform upon which he was standing collapsed.\"\u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on January 12, 2021 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSays Joe Biden stayed silent about violence at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Tom Kertscher \u2022 January 16, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.
