And that is just for 17 priority locations. The Government Accountability Office said that number is suspect, because it \"was based on an average cost per mile and is not intended to reflect the costs of individual construction projects.\" \u00a0\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on January 11, 2021 in a Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi is no longer the Speaker of the House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 January 12, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe point is, $5 billion wouldn\u2019t build a wall with Mexico.\n(For what it\u2019s worth, at the rate for the 215 miles Trump sought, it would cost about $30 billion to cover every remaining mile of the border. Other estimates have put the total at over $25 billion.)\nFunds to Iran\nSo, now let\u2019s look at the money in the multinational deal to head off Iran\u2019s nuclear development work. While critics of the deal, such as President Donald Trump, liked to say that Iran got $150 billion out of it, our research shows that\u2019s wrong in several ways.\nFirst, according to testimony from U.S. Treasury Department Secretary Jacob Lew, the total is at most about $56 billion. Some analysts say the sum is even lower than that.\nSecond, it\u2019s not right to say the United States gave Iran that money. Very little of the total was under American control. The only dollars strictly in the U.S. government\u2019s hands were about $1.7 billion from American weapons that Iran bought, but were never delivered. The rest of the money was Iran\u2019s to begin with and held in banks around the world.\nThird, seven governments signed off on the deal, including China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom and the European Union. So to pin the deal on President Barack Obama alone is off the mark. While he could have scuttled the agreement, so could any of the others.\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post said that for the money Obama gave Iran, America could build 30 walls with Mexico. The underlying numbers are $150 billion for Iran and $5 billion for a wall with Mexico. None of the numbers hold up.\nThe Trump administration said the $5 billion it sought for a wall would only build 215 miles worth. That would leave over half the border without a barrier.\nThe money from the Iran deal netted it perhaps as much as $56 billion, and probably less.\nSo, $5 billion doesn\u2019t build a wall and Iran didn\u2019t get $150 billion.
