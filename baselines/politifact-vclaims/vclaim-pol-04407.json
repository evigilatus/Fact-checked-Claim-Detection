We emailed the Trump campaign twice to ask about the basis of his statement, but we did not hear back.\nThe GOP presidential nominee\u2019s campaign posted a version of his speech online that includes a footnote to support his claim. It\u2019s a 2007 editorial in The Washington Times that accused Kaine of failing to crack down on unauthorized immigrants who commit crimes.\nBut the editorial provides no insight into whether the number of illegal immigrants in the state rose during Kaine\u2019s tenure.\nFor additional insight, we reached out to the nonpartisan Pew Hispanic Center, which estimates the size of the illegal immigration population in each state. Here are Pew\u2019s figures on the size of Virginia\u2019s illegal immigrant population by year:\n\u20222005 - 250,000\n\u20222006 - 250,000\n\u20222007 - 250,000\n\u20222008 - 275,000\n\u20222009 - 250,000\n\u20222010 - 275,000\nFor 2011 and 2012, the latest years for which figures are available, the size of the illegal immigrant population also was 275,000, Pew found.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKirk Cox\n\n\nstated on January 13, 2021 in a speech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia ranks \u201cin the bottom third of states\u201d in administering the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Warren Fiske \u2022 January 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo when Kaine entered office in 2006, the size of the illegal immigrant population was 250,000, it rose to 275,000 in 2008 and then went back down to its original level during 2009, his last full year in office, according to the Pew figures.\nIf you go to 2010, during which Kaine served only the first two weeks, the illegal immigrant population was 275,000 - or 25,000 higher than when he entered the governor\u2019s mansion.\nWhile a 10 percent increase in the illegal immigrant population between 2006 and 2010 might seem significant, it\u2019s actually not much of a change at all from a statistical perspective, said Jeffrey Passel, a senior demographer at Pew.\nPassel explained that the research group\u2019s illegal immigration figures are not meant to be exact figures on the size of the state\u2019s illegal immigrant population. Rather, they are estimates culled from a sample of data collected by the Census Bureau and are subject to rounding. Just like a public polls drawn from a sample, there\u2019s a margin of error involved in the estimates.\nDuring Kaine\u2019s time in office, the annual size of the illegal immigrant population could be 15,000 to 20,000 higher or lower than the mid-range estimate Pew reported each year, according to its report. So it\u2019s possible that a 25,000 increase from year-to-year might not outpace the Pew study\u2019s margin of error.\nThe bottom line, during Kaine\u2019s tenure the size of the illegal immigrant population remained flat, Passel said.\nNationally, the illegal immigrant population peaked in 2007 at 12.2 million and fell to 11.3 million in 2013, Pew\u2019s figures show. A major reason for that drop was the impact of the Great Recession, Passel told us.\nThe Trump campaign didn\u2019t respond to a question we posed about how Kaine\u2019s policies as governor would have led to an increase in illegal immigration.\nAnalysts told us that beyond state laws, many other factors contribute to where illegal immigrants choose to reside.\nMichelle Mittelstadt, a spokeswoman for the Migration Policy Institute, told us illegal immigrants often settle in a state based on how its economy is doing, and whether they already have family living there.\nOur ruling\nTrump said that while Kaine was governor, he \"oversaw a huge increase in illegal immigration, a tremendous increase.\"\nBut figures from the Pew Hispanic Center show that the size of the illegal immigrant population essentially was flat during Kaine\u2019s term as governor. It\u2019s certainly not\u00a0the \"huge\" and \"tremendous\" increase that Trump makes it out to be.\nWe rate his claim False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/10bcb296-66a2-4ad7-a60d-b53e86eecc3c", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-04407"}
