This was said by the District Attorney of Palm Beach Dave Aronberg in MSNBC when he was asked about the state &apos; s implementation of the Red Flag Act, which was enacted after the shooting incident at the school in Parkland. \"This law is used by law enforcement to obtain a judge to withdraw arms from a person considered to be a threat to himself or to others,\" Arunberg, a democracy, said the morning of the host Joe Mika Barzinski on August 26. \"It has been used about 2,500 times in Florida in the last year and a half. This is about five times a day.\" With the recent renewed calls for collective shooting in El Paso and Dayton to pass the Red Flag laws to keep weapons out of the hands of people who are at risk, we wanted to look closely at Aronberg's claim and study how Florida's law changes how weapons are treated day by day. Some 15 states have a red flag or high-risk laws. The laws allow the police to petition the court to order the temporary transfer of firearms from a potentially dangerous person, or to prevent the person from obtaining a firearm. After a specified period of time, the firearm shall be returned to the person concerned or the court order extended. In some states, family members can petition the court to remove the firearm, but in Florida relatives have to contact the police. We found that Aronberg was correctly quoted from state court statements on how many times the judge issued a risk protection order. The Aronberg Act in Florida, which holds the red flag, told us that he got his number about 2,500 cases from NPR's story. (The Tampa Bay Times previously mentioned the same number as the stadium) This applies to about five persons per day since the Act entered into force in March 2018. From then until July 2019, there were 2,396 threat protection orders issued by judges throughout the state. The provinces with the highest number of applications were Polk (378), Benillas (350), Broward (327), Folosia (173) and Miami-Dade (127). We met with law enforcement officials in the provinces of Broward and Benillas on how to implement the law. ...................................................................................................................................................... The judge shall hold a hearing within 24 hours with police officers who swear on the allegations. If the judge issues the interim order for the protection of risks, he or she shall order the search of the defendant &apos; s home in order to secure any firearms or ammunition. Within two weeks, the judge shall hold a final hearing at which the person may oppose the order. This is a civil process, and the defendant is therefore allowed to appoint a lawyer but is not entitled to the assistance of a court-appointed lawyer. In a news release on February 1, 2010, Charlie Christ stated that spokesman Rubio supported arms restrictions, which included background checks and waiting periods. \u2022 On February 26, 2010, Lee Logan estimated that in 90% of the cases, orders were approved by the defendant. It can last for up to one year, and law enforcement can therefore seek to renew it. The person &apos; s name is also included in the national database to prevent federal traders from selling a person &apos; s firearm. Risk protection orders require judges to take a different view of the typical criminal cases in which a judge assesses his past behaviour. \"If a person is going to carry out the threat,\" said stress. State-wide data show that the vast majority of petitions result in orders being issued by judges. Polyte Fact did not find any public record showing the total number of weapons surrendered, but Benillas Sharif Bob Gualtey said in his district that his people had delivered about 700 firearms and more than 135,000 rounds of ammunition. Gualtier said that a man who had been fired from work at the restaurant for making inappropriate advances to the employees had sent text messages indicating that he was planning to shoot women and himself. He was arrested, and the law enforcement sought a risk protection order and found that he had AR-15 and 471 rounds. Christy McKenzie, Attorney at the Mayor of Broward's Office, estimated that about 25 per cent of hazard protection order cases had a parallel criminal case. In other cases, the person did not commit any crime, but raised concerns that it might pose a risk. In a case dealt with by the lighthouse police, a man acted strangely and stopped the electrical fractures in his apartment building \"to prevent them from sending electric pulse through his body and controlling it,\" according to court records. The guy told the police he was being targeted by a neighbor who looks like Osama bin Laden. He voluntarily surrendered his firearm. There are some misconceptions that the law does not provide for due process or that the police simply confiscate firearms, but this is not the case. When a case is brought by the Deputy Chief of Police of Broward, it must first be approved by senior officials of the mayor's office and then reviewed by at least two lawyers before going to the judge. \"There are many layers of protection there,\" said McKenzie. Our rule, Aronberg, said that the Florida Red Flag Weapons Act was used \"about five times a day\" about a year and a half ago. His accounts are correct. Between March 2018 and July 2019, some 2,400 state-wide risk protection orders were issued. This means that people have been prevented from temporarily carrying weapons, but we do not know the total number of weapons delivered. We're assessing this statement right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-00213"}
