Mark Obinchen as the face of voter repression since the Republic of Harrisonburg began its successful payment in 2013 for a law requiring the Virginians to produce a photographic identity card in the ballot boxes. In August, he was booked for the State Senate seat abandoned by Henry Marsh, D-Richmond. In his 13 August newsletter, Obbenchen wrote: \"In the Democratic Party-run fire station for the selection of the party's senatorial candidate for the 16th Prefectoral Special Election, Democrats - free to adopt any criteria for the identification of voters they wish, or none of them at all - have chosen much stricter conditions than those contained in the state law in which they are denounced, and in fact go so far as to require that identity cards show the address in which the individual is registered.\" We wondered whether Democrats had already adopted rules for the identification of voters in the competition, which was stricter than the standards of State law. The State &apos; s Voter Identification Act approved and signed the Upinchin Act on party votes in the Houses of Representatives and the Senate last year. Bob McDonnell, Republican. The Democrats and many liberal organizations opposed this measure, saying that Virginia had no history of electoral fraud and expressed fears that the law would make it harder for the elderly, the poor and minorities to vote. The Republicans said that their aim was not to prevent access to ballot papers, but to protect the integrity of the Virginia elections. The Act, which entered into force on 1 July, requires voters to produce one piece of identity card in the ballot box: an identity photograph. Acceptable forms of a photo identity card include a driving licence from Virginia that has not expired for more than 12 months; an American passport or any other identity card with a United States or Virginia photo or a political subdivision; a student identity card issued by any Institute of Higher Education in Virginia; an employee identity card; or an voter identity card obtained through local registration offices. It should be noted that the law does not require the identity card to include the voter &apos; s address. Voters are required to verify their identity against the voters &apos; lists in order to ensure that a person is registered to vote in the constituency and, if so, are allowed to vote. He mentioned Greg Kelly on January 11, 2021 in a television section that says Joe Biden is on a video that announces fraud in the election at the Confession. By Bill McCarthy: January 12, 2021, identity in the 16th Precinct A is not a typical election; it is an informal grouping run by a political party, which sets the rules. On 9 August, Democrats opened two assembly sites in Richmond and each in five other townships in the 16th Prefecture. Registered voters may decline between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. If they first sign the oath of allegiance to the Democratic Party, they will pass a ballot on one of the four candidates seeking the Senate nomination. Robert Dempsey, Executive Director of the Virginia Democratic Party, sent Polyte Fact the rules for the primary special elections. They asked each voter to provide proof of registration or residence. The procedure did not require a photo ID, and Dempsey said that the party was prepared to accept some forms of identification that were once accepted in State-run elections, such as the Facilities Bill. According to Obinchin, Democrats went beyond the limits of State law by asking voters to produce two identities. Dempsey said that this occurred briefly at a polling station, as a result of a misunderstanding by officials, and was quickly corrected. Dempsey carefully observed that written procedures did not require two forms of identity cards. Opinchen also states that Democrats have exceeded state law by requiring voters to present an identity card with their current address. There's no disagreement here. Dempsey said that the officials examined the address against the address on the voting lists. If there is a difference, the elector is allowed to hold a provisional ballot. Some 3,800 votes were cast at the four-vote main fire station, including 156 temporary ballots that were never counted because they would not have made a difference in the outcome; Dell. Rosalyn's dancing from Petersburg won hands down. The county is very democratic, and the dance will have the edge this fall in a race against the independent Preston Brown. Our ruling (Obinchin) claims that the Democratic Party imposed voter identification rules at the 16th local firehouse, which were \"bigly more stringent\" than those provided for in the new state law. There was a temporary defect at a polling station that required voters to produce two identity cards, instead of only one authorized under state law. He quickly corrected this and did not reflect the party &apos; s intention. This brings us to the only identity that most of the main voters had to produce. The Democrats went beyond the law of the State one step by requesting an identity card with an address and another step by making sure that the address matched the address on the voters &apos; lists before the ballot was delivered. On the other hand, the party receives leniency points because it has not imposed a government law requiring voters to produce an identity card with a photograph. Therefore, the Obenshin statement is partially accurate but does not contain much important information. We value it half right.", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-07336"}
