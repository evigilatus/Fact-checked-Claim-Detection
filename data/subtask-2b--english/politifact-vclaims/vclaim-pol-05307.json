The ad has aired in San Francisco and multiple markets in Florida, including Miami and Tampa.\nDid the New York billionaire give the boot to disabled veterans from his high rise? No, he didn\u2019t do that. Instead, he wanted to ban disabled veterans who were given special licenses to peddle from selling their wares in front of his high rise.\n\"It is simply not true and a misrepresentation of the facts in every way,\" Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks told PolitiFact Florida.\nA few days after the ad started running on TV, the PAC changed the wording of the line about veterans. We are putting the ad\u2019s original claim on the Truth-O-Meter, but we will explain how and why the PAC tweaked the wording.\nTrump\u2019s Fifth Avenue high rise\nTrump wanted to get rid of street vendors around the Trump Tower, a 68-story condo and retail building on Fifth Avenue.\nThe ad shows a Jan. 28, 2016, headline from the Daily Beast: \"Donald Trump wanted vets kicked off Fifth Avenue.\" (A spokesman for the PAC referred PolitiFact to the Daily Beast article and the New York Daily News article cited within it.)\nPeddling exemptions for disabled veterans have a long history in New York. First approved by the state in 1894, the exemption allowed disabled veterans to peddle on any commercial street or park throughout the state.\nIn 1991, the state Legislature took up a bill to amend the law. Most peddling was prohibited on Fifth Avenue -- but 176 disabled veterans still had permission to peddle there.\nTrump wrote a letter to John Dearie, then-chairman of the state Assembly\u2019s Committee on Cities, according to the New York Daily News:\n\"While disabled veterans should be given every opportunity to earn a living, is it fair to do so to the detriment of the city as a whole or its tax-paying citizens and businesses?\" Trump wrote. \"Do we allow Fifth Avenue, one of the world\u2019s finest and most luxurious shopping districts, to be turned into an outdoor flea market, clogging and seriously downgrading the area?\"\nIn July 1991, New York City Mayor David Dinkins announced that an agreement had been reached with the Fifth Avenue Association, which represented hundreds of businesses. The businesses would offer disabled veterans jobs at twice the minimum wage, and the association would set up a fund to pay for job training, education or to move vendors to other parts of the city.\nThe next month, then-Gov. Mario Cuomo signed a bill to repeal the peddling, but only for four years.\nIn 1995, when the bill was up for renewal, the Legislature struck a compromise that banned peddling from Midtown Manhattan but included a plan to allow it in other zones to be defined later. Months later, some veterans continued to peddle in the banned area.\nIn 2004, Trump complained about the vendors in a letter to then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharlie Crist\n\n\nstated on May 23, 2014 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n41,200 veterans in Florida \"don\u2019t have health care because Scott didn\u2019t expand Medicaid.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Amy Sherman \u2022 May 28, 2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Whether they are veterans or not, they (the vendors) should not be allowed to sell on this most important and prestigious shopping street,\" Trump wrote, according to the New York Post.\nTrump wrote that business owners had to repeatedly clean up debris left as a result of the vendors.\n\"Frankly, I have no idea how they can be doing business with the mess they have outside their front door,\" he wrote. \"Fifth Avenue\u2019s comeback is going to be a short one if this situation is not corrected immediately.\"\nIn response to his letter, a small group of protesters waved signs in front of Trump Tower that read, \"Vendors to Trump: You're Fired!\" and \"Why can't vets vend on streets we die to protect?\"\nWe told the PAC\u2019s spokesman that the ad could cause viewers to wrongly assume that Trump wanted to ban disabled veterans from living in his high rise.\n\"Ad didn\u2019t mention living,\" Jeff Sadosky replied.\nPAC changes ad\nAfter we started our fact-check, the PAC changed the wording of the ad.\nThe original ad started Feb. 26, according to the Political TV Ad Archive, a website that tracks campaign ads and partnered with PolitiFact and other fact-checkers.\nOn Feb. 29, Factcheck.org wrote that the ad was \"miseading\" and left out crucial details.\nBy that date, the ad had aired at least 135 times in the Miami, Tampa and Orlando markets.\nPolitiFact first contacted the PAC about the ad on Feb. 29 and then later noticed on TV that the script had changed.\nThe original ad said that Trump \"bans disabled veterans from his high rise.\" But the new version said that Trump \"bans veterans from in front of his high rise.\"\nSadosky said the PAC changed the ad on March 1 \"to be more specific.\"\nOur ruling\nA pro-Rubio Super PAC said Trump \"bans disabled veterans from his high rise.\"\nThe TV ad is misleading because viewers could assume that Trump tried to ban disabled veterans from living in his high rise. His beef was with street vendors including disabled veterans who were given special vendor licenses selling wares around his Trump Tower.\u00a0Nothing in the ad makes it clear that this related to vendors selling on the street.\nWe rate this claim Mostly False.\nhttps://www.sharethefacts.co/share/bddef00e-4444-4749-a76b-f53a4a0967ea", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-05307"}
