The report cited a similar story from the New American, a bimonthly magazine for \"freedom-loving Americans\" who support \"limited government under the Constitution,\" according to its about page.\nFacebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook\u2019s News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThis is not the first time we have encountered falsehoods concerning\u00a0the U.N. and gun control. We previously looked at the claim that a U.N. treaty would mandate a \"new international gun registry\" and\u00a0a chain email\u00a0that wrongly accused the Obama administration of planning to use international treaties to ban all weapons.\nAs with these past statements, there is also\u00a0a lot wrong with this new report about the U.N. conference.\nThe report said U.S. representatives attending the Third Review Conference for the June 2018 U.N. Program of Action on Small Arms and Light Weapons agreed \"to begin developing \u2018legal frameworks\u2019 \u2026 that will enforce \u2018proper management\u2019 of \u2018small arms and light weapons\u2019\u00a0stockpiles.\"\nThe report went on to say, misleadingly, that the United States pledged to help the U.N. track and confiscate firearms, including stockpiles owned by private citizens.\n\"In other words, the United States government is expected to help push an absurdly anti-Second Amendment set of demands on the American people,\" the story said. \"If they don\u2019t push that set of rules upon the people swiftly enough, then the U.N. will decide if it wants to send armed peacekeepers to the nation or not. This agreement is wildly unconstitutional.\"\nCiting six points spelled out in the \"implementation at the national level\" section of the conference\u2019s outcome document, the story said the meeting resulted in the United States\u2019 willing violation of Second and Tenth Amendment rights.\nBut the story erred in its understanding of the conference. In reality, the conference provided an opportunity for participating countries to review their progress and reaffirm a commitment made in 2001 to limit the illicit trade of small arms and light weapons.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Kelly\n\n\nstated on February 8, 2021 in a Newsmax TV segment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOnly one person died on that day\u201d during the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Bill McCarthy \u2022 February 9, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the website for the U.N. Office of Disarmament Affairs, the original meeting in 2001 saw governments agree \"to improve national small arms laws, import/export controls, and stockpile management \u2014 and to engage in cooperation and assistance.\"\nNikki Haley, the U.S.\u00a0Ambassador to the U.N., attended this year's conference along with several advisers, according to\u00a0the U.N.'s list of participants. The State Department and the U.N. Office for Disarmament Affairs did not respond to requests for comment on the role of U.S. representatives at the conference.\nCaroline Dorminey, a policy analyst with the Cato Institute and an expert with the Forum on the Arms Trade, explained that the U.N. program focuses on the illegal flow of small arms and light weapons, meaning any subsequent measures enacted by the United States would not violate Second or Tenth Amendment rights.\n\"The purpose of the Third Review Conference is to make progress on stopping the illicit trade of small arms and light weapons,\" Dorminey wrote in an email. \"The trade being targeted in particular is dispersion/diversion \u2014 especially across borders \u2014 that fuels black markets and conflict in unstable regions.\"\n\"Any measures enacted by the UN program would not infringe on Second or Tenth Amendment rights because they are inherently focused on illicit trade \u2014 not the legal trade within American borders that those amendments provide the basis for.\"\nConservative Daily Post did not respond to a request for comment submitted via its contact page.\nOur ruling\nA headline stated, \"US representatives promise implement of UN gun-control plans.\"\nThe story said U.S. representatives at a U.N. conference pledged to adopt new gun-control measures that would threaten Second and Tenth Amendment rights.\nU.S. representatives at the conference did reaffirm the nation\u2019s agreement in 2001 to work toward limiting the illicit international trade of small arms and light weapons. But the United States\u2019 continued participation in such an agreement should have no effect on its citizens\u2019 constitutional rights, given the focus on illegal actions in global trade.\nWe rate this statement Mostly False.\n Share the Facts 2018-07-11 20:35:05 UTC   PolitiFact    3 1 7  PolitiFact Rating: Mostly False  \"US representatives promise implement of UN gun-control plans\"    Internet Rumors Bloggers https://conservativedailypost.com/us-representatives-promise-implement-of-un-gun-control-plans/   in a blog Thursday, July 5, 2018 2018-07-05    Read More  info", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-pol-01878"}
